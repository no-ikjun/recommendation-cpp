 " Obviously , it 's devastating , but above everything else , I 'm only one player , and you can never win a championship with just one player " , Wambach said of her injury , " I have the utmost confidence in this team bringing home the gold . " Although the team won the exhibition match with a goal scored by Natasha Kai off a free kick from Carli Lloyd and would enter the Games undefeated for the year , Wambach 's teammates were unsettled by her injury . " My heart sank " , Kai said , " We need her . She 's a big piece of a great team . " 
 Forward Lauren Cheney was called in to replace Wambach at the Games . " There are obviously tons of emotions going through me right now " , Cheney said , " I have the deepest sorrow for Abby , but I am excited to be part of the 18 going to the Olympics . " Wambach said during a conference call a few days after the injury , " I called Lauren Cheney from the hospital , ' I want you to go there and not feel bad about being selected in this type of way ... What 's important is that the team going into this tournament is feeling that they can win this . At the end of the day , that 's what makes you stand at the top podium . "

There 's nothing more you can ask for than play in front of your home crowd and come through with a milestone like I did today . " She reached 100 goals in fewer games than any of the four other American players who had previously reached 100 goals : Mia Hamm , Kristine Lilly , Michelle Akers and Tiffeny Milbrett .

 = Life Is Good ( Nas album ) = 
 Life Is Good is the eleventh studio album by American rapper Nas . It was recorded at various studios in New York and California , and produced primarily by No I.D. and Salaam Remi . Nas wrote the album after his divorce from recording artist Kelis and compared it to Marvin Gaye 's 1978 record Here , My Dear . He wanted to vent personal feelings and address moments in his life in his songs , while drawing on 1980s hip hop influences for the album 's production in order to complement its nostalgic tone . 
 Life Is Good features personal subject matter , themes of adulthood and nostalgia , and reflections on Nas ' personal life and experience in hip hop . His rapping is characterized by a relaxed , plainspoken flow , internal rhymes , and a tone that veers from malicious to nostalgic and introspective . The album 's production incorporates orchestral elements and musical references to both contemporary and golden age hip hop , including boom bap beats and old school samples . 
 When Life Is Good was released on July 13 , 2012 , by Def Jam Recordings , it received widespread critical acclaim and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in the United States . It also reached the top 10 of record charts in Canada , Switzerland , and the United Kingdom . It was promoted with three singles — " Nasty " , " The Don " , and " Daughters " — five music videos , and Nas ' touring during June to December 2012 . By February 10 , 2013 , Life Is Good had sold 354 @,@ 000 copies , according to Nielsen SoundScan . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 2010 , Nas released his tenth studio album Distant Relatives , a collaboration with Damian Marley that reinvigorated Nas creatively . He soon became distracted by tax problems and an expensive , highly publicized divorce from his wife Kelis months before their son 's birth , events that influenced his direction for Life Is Good . His songwriting on the album was also influenced by adjusting back to life as a single man . Nas also wanted to write more original subject matter rather than another album " about how you came up in the hood and how you had to make it out of the hood " . 
 Although he did not find his album " quite so much about the marriage or the divorce " , Nas likened Life Is Good to Marvin Gaye 's 1978 album Here , My Dear , which was written by Gaye in response to his own deteriorating marriage and released as a financial settlement . Nas said of the album 's personal subject matter in an interview for Billboard : 
 The album 's cover depicts a forlorn Nas in a polished white suit , sitting in a night club 's VIP lounge , and holding over his knee Kelis ' actual green wedding dress , which he said was the only item she left . When writing the album , Nas also reflected on aging and maturation , fatherhood , and his 20 @-@ year experience in hip hop music .

 Recording sessions for the album took place at the following recording studios — 4220 Studios , Conway Recording Studios , and East West Studios in Hollywood , Instrument Zoo Studios in Miami , Jungle City Studios and Oven Studios in New York City , Record One in Sherman Oaks , and Westlake Studios in Los Angeles . Nas worked with several musicians , including Amy Winehouse , Mary J. Blige , James Poyser , Anthony Hamilton , Miguel , Large Professor , and Hal Ritson , among others . 
 For the album , Nas wanted the production to complement his lyrics ' nostalgic themes with 1980s hip hop influences . He primarily worked with hip hop producers No I.D. and Salaam Remi , a frequent collaborator of Nas . Remi said that he wanted his production " to be something that a mumble @-@ mouth rapper can ’ t rap on . You better have something to say and be speaking up . " Along with producer Swizz Beatz , No I.D. and Nas related to the latter 's lyrics concerning divorce during the recording sessions . During the sessions , Nas recorded the song " No Such Thing as White Jesus " with singer Frank Ocean and producer Hit Boy , who misplaced the track while sorting through music he had produced for Jay @-@ Z and Kanye West 's album Watch the Throne ( 2011 ) . Although he later recovered it , the song was not included on Life Is Good . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 The album incorporates musical references to both older and contemporary hip hop . Its production features live instrumentation , orchestral music , R & B , and boom bap elements . Music journalist Evan Rytlewski denotes " boom @-@ bap drums , lush keyboards , smooth saxophones , and the occasional Run @-@ D.M.C. and MC Shan sample " to be " tasteful accents " from golden age hip hop . Ryan Hamm of Under the Radar views that Remi and No I.D. ' s production " lean [ s ] toward opulent and epic " , while Pitchfork Media 's Jayson Greene writes that the latter 's produced songs " exude the warm TV @-@ fireplace crackle of ... throwback production . " Anupa Mistry of Now writes that " boom bap classicists Salaam Remi and No I.D. weave a raw , funky , orchestral lattice customized for Nas 's age @-@ appropriate raps " . 
 Life Is Good features nostalgic and adult themes , including aging and maturity . Nas ' rapping is characterized by internal rhymes , a relaxed , plainspoken flow , and transparent lyrics addressing moments in his life , including his youth and the personal events leading up to the album . Erika Ramirez of Billboard observes " stories of internal and external battles , some of which he won and some he lost . " David Dennis of The Village Voice writes that his lyrics address hip hop 's " golden era " and " the trials and tribulations of adult relationships " . Brandon Soderberg from Spin asserts that his lyrics " constantly remind <unk> that the good ol ' days were often chaotic and desperate " . Slant Magazine 's Manan Desai finds Nas ' comparison of his album to Gaye 's Here , My Dear apropos . " Like Nas , Gaye was pushing 40 when he recorded his album " , Desai wrote . " He 'd cemented his position as one of R & B 's greatest , and yet , he never sounded more anguished about where all that fame was leading him . There 's something similar going on throughout Life Is Good ; the more we hear Nas repeat that titular refrain , the less convincing he sounds . " AllMusic 's David Jeffries said the lyrics about his divorce were " unfiltered carpet bombing of love and marriage " ; both Jeffries and Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic characterize the content as " venomous " . Conversely , Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone views that Nas " cuts his rhymes with midlife realism and daring empathy " . Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe writes that the songs " mix anger , nostalgia , and insight . " 
 On the opening track " No Introduction " , Nas reflects on his impoverished upbringing and maturation into a " graphic , classic song composer " . The song 's subject matter ranges from lifestyle boats to revolutionary ideals : " Hood forever , I just act like I ’ m civilized / Really what ’ s in my mind is organizing a billion Black <unk> / To take over JP and Morgan Goldman and Sachs / And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back " . " Loco @-@ Motive " has an underground vibe and keyboards similar to Nas ' 1994 song " N.Y. State of Mind " . " A Queens Story " has boom bap and classical elements in its production , including classical piano , orchestral strings and funky drums . Its lyrics pay homage to Nas ' native Queens and his creative influences . " Accident Murderers " incorporates pipe organ in its production , and its lyrics addresses senseless violence with a rags @-@ to @-@ riches narrative by Rick Ross . 
 On " Daughters " , Nas is bewildered at the responsibilities of fatherhood , as he addresses his daughter 's social networking activity and worries about his past undermining his parental authority . Killian Fox of The Observer writes that Nas ' observations on his ex @-@ wife 's " hefty childcare payments " and his 18 @-@ year @-@ old daughter " dating unsuitable men " are resonated by his " recollections of his early years as a Queensbridge hustler – just the kind of unsuitable young man he 's warning his daughter about these days " . " Reach Out " features Mary J. Blige and incorporates the piano loop from Isaac Hayes ' 1970 song " Ike 's Mood " . Its lyrics address Nas ' feeling displaced " when you 're too hood to be in the Hollywood circles , you 're too rich to be in the hood that birthed you " . " You Wouldn 't Understand " addresses life struggles and features a mellow production and neo soul influences . " Back When " has flickering production and <unk> lyrics by Nas : " check out the oracle bred by city housing " . 
 The up @-@ tempo " The Don " samples Super Cat 's 1982 song " Dance <unk> New York " and has a 1990s hip hop sound . Its lyrics extol both Nas ' rapping prowess and New York City . According to No Ripcord 's James McKenna , " Stay " mixes soul and jazz elements , " bringing to mind Low End Theory era A Tribe Called Quest and Tupac 's Me Against the World , and lyrics " questioning the line between love and hate " . " Cherry Wine " features vocals by Amy Winehouse and a narrative between ill @-@ fated lovers . The song was titled after Winehouse 's guitar , which she called " cherry " . Jesal Padania of RapReviews cites it as " quite possibly the best ' ladies number ' that Nas has ever delivered , though it is infinitely classier than that label . " On " Bye Baby " , Nas ' lyrics address his ex @-@ wife and recount their marriage in a narrative that follows the wedding , counseling sessions , marriage counseling , and the legal process of their divorce .

 Life is Good received widespread acclaim from critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received an average score of 81 , based on 30 reviews . Kevin Perry of NME called it " a grimy , back @-@ to @-@ basics return to form " , while Pitchfork Media 's Jayson Greene said Nas had " settled gracefully into strengths " , Slant Magazine 's Manan Desai said Nas sounded " inspired " and praised the album 's " narrative unity " as " a wide @-@ angle look of the artist as a grown man . " Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club deemed Nas ' lyrics " beautifully expressed " and the music just " as thoughtful " . Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times called it a " thoughtful , fierce , honest and – most important – heavy @-@ duty work " and stated , " Nas has gotten better at rolling with the punches – and you can hear it in every verse " . Carl Chery from XXL said it is " arguably Nas ' best LP since Stillmatic " and asserted , " At this juncture — 21 years and 10 solo albums in — no other MC has ever rhymed at such a high level this deep into their career . " 
 In a less enthusiastic review for MSN Music , Robert Christgau gave Life Is Good a three @-@ star honorable mention , citing " Daughters " and " Accident Murderers " as highlights and deeming the record " reflections of a bigshot who , as he mentions several times , is damn big " . AllMusic 's David Jeffries called it a " puff @-@ chested bitch session " and felt " Nas needed to get [ this album ] out of his system , acting as a clearing house for all venom and bile , plus some gloss that doesn 't fit but needed to go as well . " New York Times critic Jon Caramanica felt his narratives were " sometimes <unk> fanciful " and his lyrics occasionally " overstuffed " , even though the record possessed " a simulacrum of the sound that made him legendary " . Matthew <unk> from PopMatters was more critical , finding the production " uneven " and calculated " as product " , with " half @-@ done ideas " . 
 Life Is Good appeared on several critics ' year @-@ end top albums lists . It was named the best album of 2012 by The Source and Okayplayer . The album was also ranked number 18 by Rolling Stone , number 12 by Complex , number 16 by James Montgomery of MTV , number six by Martin Caballero of The Boston Globe , and number seven by Jon Caramanica of The New York Times .

 = Theodore Roosevelt High School ( Kent , Ohio ) = 
 Theodore Roosevelt High School ( RHS or <unk> ) , often referred to as Kent Roosevelt ( <unk> ) , is a public high school in Kent , Ohio , United States . It is the only high school in Kent and the Kent City School District and serves students in grades 9 – 12 living in Kent , Franklin Township , Brady Lake , and Sugar Bush Knolls as well as a small portion of southern Streetsboro . As of 2015 , enrollment was 1 @,@ 284 with 110 teachers for a student – teacher ratio of 12 : 1 . Recognition for academic performance over the years has come from the United States Department of Education , Ohio Department of Education , and U.S. News & World Report . 
 The school was founded in 1868 as Kent High School and was first housed at the Franklin Township Hall until the completion of the Union School building in March 1869 . In 1922 , the school was moved to a new facility named for U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt on a 10 @-@ acre ( 4 @.@ 0 ha ) campus , which would serve as the high school until 1959 . Following completion of a new building on a larger 31 @-@ acre ( 13 ha ) campus along North Mantua Street in northern Kent , Roosevelt was moved to this location . The building has had a number of additions made beginning in the mid @-@ 1960s and contains nearly 70 classrooms , a library , gymnasium , auditorium , and indoor pool . The campus has been expanded over the years to 88 acres ( 36 ha ) and also includes several athletic facilities and practice fields . 
 Nearly 200 courses are offered at the school including 13 Advanced Placement classes and 25 vocational education programs . Roosevelt is part of the Six District Educational Compact which pools vocational resources with five nearby high schools . There are also two academy programs for students with various educational needs . Other elective courses offered include those in the study Arabic language , lifeguard training , various aspects of American history and culture , multiple writing and journalism courses , and the visual , performing , and practical arts . There are multiple co- and extracurricular clubs and activities , many of which have earned outside recognition at the state and national levels . Roosevelt athletic teams are known as the Rough Riders with school colors of red , white , and black , and compete in the Suburban League American Division as part of the Ohio High School Athletic Association . Notable Roosevelt alumni include a Governor of Ohio , professional athletes , and entertainment figures . 
 = = History = = 
 The establishment of what is today Theodore Roosevelt High School occurred in 1868 when the first classes of what was originally known as Kent High School were held . This was preceded first by the formation of the Franklin Union School District around 1860 , which brought four smaller schoolhouse districts under one administration in what was then known as Franklin Mills . In 1867 , the school board decided to consolidate the various neighborhood schoolhouses and create a graded curriculum , which included separate high school classes . As part of the consolidation effort , construction of a new building , known as the Union School , began at the corner of Park Avenue and North Mantua Street on a hill overlooking the newly named village of Kent . Construction of the school was part of a number of building developments in Kent in the late 1860s , including two churches and a large bank building . The name of the settlement was changed from Franklin Mills to Kent in 1864 and the village was incorporated from part of Franklin Township in 1867 after population growth began in the mid @-@ 1860s followed the arrival of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad and its shops in 1863 . The laying of the Union School 's cornerstone on May 29 , 1867 , was hailed by the local newspaper , the Kent Bulletin , as an event " which is brighter than anything heretofore recorded in our favor . " 
 Because of construction delays , the building was not ready for classes in September 1868 , so the first classes of the high school were held at the nearby Franklin Township Hall while students in grades 1 – 8 remained at their old schoolhouses . The new building opened on March 14 , 1869 with the high school grades located in the southwest room of the second floor and the four primary grades on the first floor . The third floor of the building was an open , multi @-@ purpose room . The school held its first graduation ceremony in July 1869 with a class of just one , a student named Anna Nutting . Nutting later taught at the Union School and eventually became its principal , serving until 1888 . The Union School , which would later be known as Central School , served as the home of all Kent students until two additional elementary schools for grades 1 – 6 were constructed in the 1880s . For most of the 1910s , all of the school buildings were overcrowded and the high school graduating classes had grown to nearly 40 students . As a result , a new , separate high school building was built in 1922 . The Union / Central building remained in service mainly for grades K – 7 until 1953 , when it was closed after the completion of a new Central Elementary School on the same property . It was razed in 1954 . Because of Kent High School 's location in what became known as the Central School by the late 19th century , the school is often referred to contemporarily and historically as Kent Central High or simply as Central High . 
 = = = First campus , 1922 – 1959 = = = 
 Increases in enrollment throughout the 1910s led the school board to request funds to build a new high school building along with additions to other district buildings to ease overcrowding and prepare for expected growth in enrollment . A bond issue for the various construction projects was approved by voters June 24 , 1919 . Initially , the school board had planned to build the school on property along South Water Street adjacent to downtown , but decided against this citing the need for a larger lot and building to accommodate expected growth . Eventually , a 10 @-@ acre ( 4 @.@ 0 ha ) site at the intersection of Park Avenue and North Prospect Street was purchased and construction began May 31 , 1921 . It was completed less than a year later , on May 22 , 1922 , and hosted commencement exercises for the graduating class in June . 
 The four @-@ story building cost $ 400 @,@ 000 ( approximately $ 5 million present @-@ day ) and contained a gymnasium with seating for 300 , an 833 @-@ seat auditorium , and 27 classrooms . Later that year , in August , the Kent School Board adopted a resolution to name the building after former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt . The first classes were held in the building September 6 , 1922 and it was dedicated September 22 . By then , the high school enrollment had grown to approximately 400 students . In the late 1930s , a separate annex was built behind the building to house industrial arts classes . The North Prospect Street building served as the high school until 1959 , when Roosevelt was relocated to a new building and campus along North Mantua Street in northern Kent . The building on North Prospect street was rededicated in 1959 as Davey Junior High School after the local Davey family and served as the junior high school for grades 7 – 9 . It was later renamed Davey Middle School and housed grades 6 – 8 . At the conclusion of the 1998 – 1999 school year , the building was closed for an extensive renovation , and reopened in 2000 as Davey Elementary School . 
 = = = North Mantua campus , since 1959 = = = 
 Further growth in Kent during the 1950s spurred discussion of a new high school with a larger campus offering more room for future expansion . In 1955 , district voters approved a $ 1 @.@ 5 million bond issue ( approximately $ 13 million present @-@ day ) followed by a $ 650 @,@ 000 bond issue ( about $ 5 million present @-@ day ) in 1957 to fund a new high school , new elementary school , and renovation of the old high school to become a junior high school . Also in 1957 , the school board purchased several acres of farmland along North Mantua Street as the site for the new high school campus . Although some viewed the site as too remote , construction began in 1958 and the building was opened September 8 , 1959 housing 550 students in grades 10 – 12 . Enrollment increases throughout the 1960s and 1970s would necessitate several additions and by 1968 , the graduating class numbered 238 students . Also in 1959 , the Franklin Township and Brady Lake districts merged with the Kent City School District , bringing additional students to Roosevelt . Prior to that time some students from Franklin Township and Brady Lake , neither of which had an accredited high school , attended Roosevelt as tuition @-@ paying students to complete their high school diploma , while others finished at Kent State High School . The state of Ohio had previously paid tuition for rural schools without accredited high schools , but discontinued doing so in the late 1950s . 
 In 1972 , many of the students from Kent State High School , which had closed earlier that year , were transferred to Roosevelt . Beginning in 1978 , ninth graders started attending the high school again for the first time since 1959 due to overcrowding at Davey Junior High School . In 1985 , Roosevelt was honored as one of 212 high schools in the United States to earn the Presidential Excellence in Education award from the U.S. Department of Education . Since 2004 , Roosevelt has consistently been rated " Excellent " by the Ohio Department of Education and in December 2009 , US News & World Report named Roosevelt in the 2010 " Best High Schools " issue as a Bronze Medal school . The school earned a " Bronze Medal " ranking and was one of only 46 high schools in the state of Ohio to be named in the report . Roosevelt was named as a Bronze Medal school again in 2015 and 2016 . 
 = = Campus and facilities = = 
 In addition to approximately 70 classrooms , the building contains a multi @-@ purpose gymnasium , auditorium , a library , and a six @-@ lane indoor swimming pool . When first opened in 1959 , the building contained 27 classrooms , a library , and the gymnasium . Several additions have been made to the building and campus since 1959 . In the mid @-@ 1960s , an additional classroom wing was added , followed in the early 1970s by construction of a vocational classroom wing and the auditorium and adjoining scene shop . In the late 1970s , two more additions were built ; one wing containing classrooms and an indoor swimming pool and the other an expansion of the second floor . The most recent additions in 1997 expanded the cafeteria and added a new art room and music storage room , along with several renovations and upgrades throughout the building . 
 The Roosevelt High School campus covers 88 acres ( 36 ha ) along North Mantua Street ( State Route 43 ) in northern Kent , adjacent to the corporate headquarters of the Davey Tree Expert Company . Along with the school building on the eastern end of the campus and Stanton Middle School on the western end , there are facilities and practice fields for several sports that are used for physical education and athletic competitions . The largest facility is Roosevelt Stadium , built in 1970 , which includes a natural grass playing surface , an eight @-@ lane all @-@ weather running track , and locker rooms . It is used primarily for football and track and field . Adjacent to Roosevelt Stadium on the west is the smaller Stanton Stadium , used for lacrosse and soccer , which has an additional nine @-@ lane all @-@ weather track used by Stanton Middle School . Between Stanton Stadium and Stanton Middle School is the Adam S. Hamilton Fitness Center , named after 2007 Roosevelt graduate and athlete Adam S. Hamilton , who was killed on duty in Afghanistan in 2011 . The center is used by the various athletic teams , physical education classes , athletic healthcare program , and as a locker room for athletic teams who use Stanton Stadium . The fitness center opened in 2000 and is housed in the building that previously served as the district 's bus garage prior to the construction of Stanton Middle School in 1997 . It was renovated and rededicated in honor of Hamilton in 2015 . On the other side of Roosevelt Stadium are the baseball field , softball field , and a six @-@ court tennis complex with additional open practice fields spread mainly along the southern part of campus . These fields are generally used for field hockey , football , soccer , and lacrosse . 
 The campus site , previously a farm , was originally 31 acres ( 13 ha ) . Since its purchase in 1957 it has been expanded multiple times , with a 17 @.@ 4 @-@ acre ( 7 @.@ 0 ha ) addition in 1967 , a 19 @.@ 5 @-@ acre ( 7 @.@ 9 ha ) expansion in 1990 that was used as the site for Stanton Middle School later that decade , and other adjacent parcels . Along with the construction of Stanton Middle School , several changes were made to the campus between 1997 and 2000 , including additional sports facilities and practice fields and the realignment of Roosevelt Drive .

 The Roosevelt student body comes from an area that includes most of the city of Kent , most of Franklin Township , and all of the villages of Brady Lake and Sugar Bush Knolls . A very small portion of Streetsboro is also included . The student body can also include those from outside the district through open enrollment , which is open to students from any school district in Ohio . The enrollment count in September 2015 was 1 @,@ 284 students in grades 9 – 12 , which includes 213 students from Six District Educational Compact schools . During the 2014 – 14 school year , in which Roosevelt had a student body of 1 @,@ 151 , 78 @.@ 1 % of students were classified as non @-@ Hispanic White , 10 @.@ 1 % non @-@ Hispanic Black , 1 @.@ 4 % Asian , and 8 @.@ 0 % multi @-@ racial , largely reflecting the demographics for the city of Kent . 35 @.@ 0 % of Roosevelt students were labeled by the state of Ohio as economically disadvantaged , which classifies Roosevelt as a medium @-@ low poverty school , and 14 @.@ 3 % of students were identified as having some sort of disability . The Roosevelt four @-@ year graduation rate is 93 @.@ 9 % , which is above the state average of 82 @.@ 2 % and state requirement of 90 % . 
 Dennis Love , a 1993 Roosevelt graduate , serves as principal , a position he has held since June 2015 . Previously , he had been serving as an assistant . The school employs a teaching faculty of 110 for an average student – teacher ratio of 11 : 1 . 85 ( 77 @.@ 2 % ) of teachers hold a master 's degree or beyond . There are nearly 60 additional staff members , which includes a career education assistant principal , two unit assistant principals , support staff , aides , tutors , guidance counselors , and administration .

 The daily schedule is from 7 : 30 AM to 2 : 29 PM and consists of seven 51 @-@ minute periods with four minutes between each class and a 30 @-@ minute lunch period . Students who have lunch option are permitted to leave the campus during their lunch period and upper classmen who have a study hall during their final period may leave early . The school year is divided into four 9 @-@ week grading periods which form two 18 @-@ week semesters . The first semester generally begins in mid @-@ August and concludes in December while the second semester begins in early January and finishes in late <unk> <unk> graduation requirements for the class of 2014 and beyond include 21 @.@ 5 total credits . Of these , four must be in English , four in math , three each in science and social studies , one each in physical education and fine or practical arts , half a credit in health , and five elective credits . Within the credit requirements are specific classes that must be taken while the remainder can be filled by elective classes . Beginning with the class of 2017 , the school will begin using the Cum Laude system for recognizing academic achievement instead of class rank . Curriculum is based on state content standards set by the Ohio Department of Education as well as additional national standards . Since 1909 , the school has been accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools . 
 Roosevelt offers nearly 200 courses including 13 Advanced Placement ( AP ) , 25 vocational education , and numerous elective and required classes at varying levels of interest and understanding . Advanced Placement courses are offered in biology , calculus , chemistry , combined electricity and magnetism and mechanics physics , English literature , French , Spanish , combined U.S. government and comparative government and politics , U.S. history , statistics , and studio art . Successful completion of an AP course adds an additional point that is factored into a student 's class rank . Additionally , students are able to take advanced courses at nearby colleges and universities such as Kent State University and the University of Akron through two post @-@ secondary dual enrollment options , which allow students to take credits that either fill both their high school and college graduation requirements or are for college credit only . 
 Vocational programs , known as Career and College Tech Prep classes , are available at the school and through the Six District Educational Compact , which includes the Cuyahoga Falls , Hudson , Stow @-@ Munroe Falls , Tallmadge , and Woodridge school districts . The compact , established in 1969 , combines and shares the vocational programs and resources of member schools and allows students to participate in the programs that are offered at each of the schools even if the program is at another building . There are 25 programs , six of which are College Tech Prep Initiative programs that allow students to earn both high school and college credits . The remaining 19 programs are Career Programs designed to give students training and work experience . College Tech Prep programs housed at Roosevelt include programs in athletic healthcare and fitness , manufacturing and engineering , landscape horticulture , and teaching . Career Programs housed at Roosevelt include two business @-@ related programs , computer @-@ aided design and manufacturing technologies , construction and remodeling , cosmetology , electronics , health technology , marketing , and out @-@ of @-@ school internships . Additional programs available through the compact that are housed at other schools include aviation , culinary arts , theater arts , automotive repair and technology , banking and finance , and early childhood educational aide training . Each program also has co @-@ curricular component , meaning they have both in @-@ class and outside requirements and responsibilities that are factored into the student 's overall grade . One example is the Roosevelt chapter of DECA , which is part of the marketing education program . In 2016 , DECA members representing Roosevelt advanced to the international competition for the 30th consecutive year . 
 = = = Academies = = = 
 There are two general education academy programs offered at the school . Both programs , Bridges Academy and Expedition Academy , are for students in grades 9 and 10 . Bridges Academy , known simply as " Bridges " , focuses on students who are identified in 8th grade as possibly having difficulty transitioning to the high school setting for academic , social , and / or emotional reasons . In the program , they are able to take required classes in a smaller setting , averaging around 10 students per class , to allow for more one @-@ on @-@ one interaction with the teacher . Until 2014 , students spent the morning part of their day at the Central School annex , returning to the main high school campus at lunch . The Central building was closed at the end of the 2013 – 14 school year , and all classes were moved to the high school campus . 
 The Expedition Academy is an advanced program based on the Expeditionary Learning model of Kurt Hahn and uses both traditional and experimental teaching methods and models . It was formed in 1999 as a result of a study using focus groups and interviews of 300 students which found that students generally felt they needed more " real @-@ world " applications to their school work including community service , problem solving , and curriculum integration . The two @-@ year program includes advanced courses in English , U.S. and world history , biology , and ecology and also includes a health class and an academy @-@ specific physical education class integrated with outdoor education and community service .

 Roosevelt offers several visual and performing arts classes and programs that vary according to grade level and interest . Classes are also available in practical arts , such as consumer science , information technology , and industrial technology . While all fine and practical arts classes are electives , one full @-@ year credit of either fine or practical arts is required to graduate . 
 Roosevelt offers four successive levels of general art classes , as well as classes in drawing and painting , clay and sculpture , glass and fiber , and an Advanced Placement studio art class that focuses on portfolio development . Three successive levels of photography classes are also offered . Generally , each art class lasts for a semester .

 The musical performing arts programs — band , orchestra , and choir — are considered co @-@ curricular , with the out @-@ of @-@ class requirements usually in the form of performances and additional rehearsals not during the school day . Each musical group also has additional extra @-@ curricular ensembles and solo opportunities . Ensembles and soloists participate annually in the Ohio Music Education Association ( <unk> ) Solo and Ensemble <unk> Event , while the main groups participate in <unk> 's Large Group <unk> Event . These events allow students to perform for judges and receive a rating and comments based on specific criteria . 
 The Rough Rider Marching Band and flag corps perform at home and away football games , and at local and national competitions . In late October , after the football season , the band separates into concert band and wind symphony ensembles . Immediately after the final home game of every season , the band performs what is known as " Script Kent " , a formation similar to " Script Ohio " performed by The Ohio State University Marching Band and using the same song , Le Régiment de Sambre et Meuse by Robert Planquette . As part of the tradition , the band spells out " Kent " with the stadium lights off and band members wearing green glow sticks around their ankles that are uncovered only after the stadium lights have been turned off . The marching band also hosts a yearly band show in late August , known as the " Roosevelt Premier of Bands " that features several local high school bands and marches in Kent 's annual Memorial Day parade in May . Additional extra @-@ curricular performance groups include Jazz Band and brass , woodwind , percussion ensembles . The Roosevelt orchestra program is composed mainly of an all @-@ string chamber orchestra . Extracurricular ensembles include a pit orchestra for the school 's annual musical production and several smaller ensembles . 
 The choral program includes two all @-@ female choirs known as Treble Choir and Women 's Chorale , a mixed four @-@ part choir called ChoralWorks , and an all @-@ male choir known as Men 's Chorus .

 = = = Athletics = = = 
 Roosevelt 's teams are known as the Rough Riders , owing to the school 's namesake Theodore Roosevelt , and the school colors are red , white , and black . As of 2013 , Roosevelt fields 28 varsity athletic teams , the most recent addition being the girls golf team , which became a varsity sport in August 2013 after two years as a club . Previously , girls who wanted to play golf could compete as individuals on the boys ' team . There are additional teams in most sports at the junior varsity level as well as a few sports that have freshman @-@ only teams . All teams except the golf , ice hockey , and bowling have their home games in facilities on the Roosevelt campus . Ice hockey home games are held in the Kent State University Ice Arena , boys golf plays their home matches at Oak Knolls Golf Course just north of the Roosevelt campus , girls golf uses the Fairways of Twin Lakes , and the bowling teams have home matches at the Kent Lanes bowling alley . 
 The school is a member the Ohio High School Athletic Association ( OHSAA ) and competes at the OHSAA Division I level in all sports except football , where it competes in Division II . Since August 2015 Roosevelt has been a member of the Suburban League American Division for all sports except ice hockey , field hockey , and boys and girls lacrosse , as few or no other Suburban League schools have teams in those sports . Ice hockey competes in the Greater Cleveland High School Hockey League and field hockey in the Northeast Ohio Field Hockey League . Boys lacrosse is part of the Ohio High School Lacrosse Association Division I , while girls lacrosse competes in Division II of the Ohio Schoolgirls Lacrosse Association as lacrosse is not an OHSAA sanctioned sport . 
 Roosevelt was a member of the Trolley League , later called the Western Reserve League , from 1919 until 1948 when the league dissolved . After competing as an independent , the school joined the Metropolitan League in 1954 . The Riders competed in the Metro League until it was absorbed in 1996 by the formation of the Western Reserve Conference . From 1996 – 2005 , the Rough Riders were part of the WRC South Division . Roosevelt joined the Portage Trail Conference Metro Division in 2005 and competed in the league until 2015 . During the time in the PTC , girls golf competed in the Northeast Ohio Independent School Girl 's Golf League , and swimming and diving in the Northeast Aquatic Conference since the PTC did not have enough teams for league play in those sports . 
 Roosevelt 's archrival is the Ravenna High School Ravens , located in nearby Ravenna . The two schools were long @-@ time rivals in successive athletic leagues , most recently as members of the Portage Trail Conference Metro Division until 2015 . The rivalry , most prominent in football , began in the early 20th century and can be traced to the longtime rivalry between the cities of Kent and Ravenna that dates back to the early 19th century . With Roosevelt 's shift to the Suburban League , the two teams will continue to play in most sports . Roosevelt also has a long @-@ standing rivalry with the Bulldogs of Stow @-@ Munroe Falls High School , located in neighboring Stow , as the two schools are only around 2 miles ( 3 km ) apart . Both schools were league rivals for over 50 years in the former Metro League and Western Reserve Conference until Roosevelt joined the PTC in 2005 . Since then the two have continued to meet in a variety of sports including football , soccer , boys basketball , swimming and diving , and field hockey . Beginning in 2015 , both schools are members of the Suburban League , but in opposite divisions . 
 Several Roosevelt teams have enjoyed both league and state success . The football team , established in 1910 , has won 24 league titles with the most recent being in 2013 . The team has had undefeated regular seasons in 1922 , 1966 , 1990 , 2006 , and 2008 with state playoff appearances in 2006 , 2008 , 2010 , 2011 , 2012 , and 2013 . The program has produced a number of players who have gone on to play major college football and professionally in the National Football League ( NFL ) including Mike Adamle , <unk> Boykin , Tom DeLeone , and Stan White . The boys golf team has been one of the school 's most successful and consistent teams winning the school 's first state championship in 1944 and 38 league titles through the 2014 season . The team has posted two undefeated regular seasons , in 1983 and again in 2009 . 
 The boys cross country team won back @-@ to @-@ back state titles in 1980 and 1981 after a runner @-@ up finish in 1979 , and the girls cross country team posted runner @-@ up finishes in 1997 and 1999 . In 2010 , the 1980 boys cross country team was awarded the National Cross Country Co @-@ Championship by <unk> , the National Historical Archives for prep cross country . Recognized as one of the top teams in U.S. history , the team ran three of the top five team averages for 2 @.@ 5 miles ever during the 1980 season . The 12 : 04 team average at the Warrior Classic and 12 : 17 at the Ohio State Championships rank as two of the top team performances all @-@ time . Additional state titles have been won by the girls field hockey team in 1981 with a runner @-@ up finish in 1988 , and the boys ice hockey team in 1982 after finishing as runner @-@ up the year prior . 
 Boys basketball has won 22 league titles , the most recent being in 2012 , and played in consecutive OHSAA district championship games in 2009 and 2010 . The team enjoyed their greatest season in 1957 when they advanced to the state championship game , falling to Middletown High School , which was led by future NBA great Jerry Lucas . The boys lacrosse team , formed in 2000 , has state runner @-@ up finishes in 2001 and 2005 along with state final four appearances by boys soccer and boys volleyball in 1999 . 
 Roosevelt also fields girls soccer , girls tennis , and girls volleyball in the fall sports season ( August – November ) along with football , field hockey , boys soccer , boys and girls cross country , boys and girls golf , and cheerleading . In the winter sports season ( November – February ) , in addition to the boys basketball and ice hockey teams , there are also boys and girls bowling , girls basketball , boys and girls swimming and diving , and wrestling teams , plus an additional cheerleading squad .

 = Nikephoros Xiphias = 
 Nikephoros Xiphias ( Greek : Νικηφόρος <unk> , fl. ca . 1000 – 1028 ) was a Byzantine military commander during the reign of Emperor Basil II . He played a distinguished role in the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria , and was instrumental in the decisive Byzantine victory at the Battle of Kleidion in 1014 . In 1022 he led an unsuccessful rebellion against Basil II , and was disgraced , tonsured and exiled . He is last mentioned in 1028 , when he was recalled from exile and retired to a monastery . 
 = = Origin = = 
 Nikephoros Xiphias was born probably some time around or before 980 , and was most likely the son of Alexios Xiphias , who served as the Catepan of Italy in 1006 – 08 . Few members of the <unk> are otherwise known and the family 's origin is unclear , but they most likely hailed from Asia Minor , like many other prestigious families of the military aristocracy of the period . 
 = = Wars against Bulgaria = = 
 Nikephoros appears for the first time in Emperor Basil II 's Bulgarian wars , in 999 / 1000 , 1000 / 1 or 1002 , depending on the source . At the time he was a protospatharios , and along with the patrikios <unk> , he commanded a campaign deep into Bulgarian lands . Setting out from Mosynopolis , the two generals crossed the Balkan Mountains and captured the old Bulgarian capitals of Pliska and Great Preslav , along with Little Preslav . They then plundered the Dobruja , left behind garrisons and returned to their base . It is unclear whether he was already the military governor ( strategos ) of Philippopolis at the time , or was appointed to it after the successful conclusion of the campaign , as John Skylitzes reports , when <unk> , who is known to have previously held the post , retired due to his advanced age . 
 Xiphias is next mentioned in the Battle of Kleidion in 1014 , when Basil II was attempting to force the pass known as Kleidion or <unk> <unk> , which the Bulgarians under their ruler Samuil had strongly fortified . Xiphias , still strategos of Philippopolis , suggested to the Emperor to bypass the Bulgarian positions and strike them from the rear . After Basil agreed , Xiphias led a picked infantry detachment over Mount Belasica , and on 29 July 1014 , led his troops on a charge on the unsuspecting Bulgarians , who panicked and broke before the unexpected attack . For this feat , which resulted in one of the most decisive victories in the long Bulgarian war , he was rewarded with promotion to the rank of patrikios . In early 1015 , Xiphias , along with Constantine Diogenes , subdued the region of Moglena , which had rebelled against imperial rule . Towards the end of the same year he campaigned from Mosynopolis to the region of <unk> ( Sofia ) , razing its environs and capturing the fort of Boyana . Finally , in the last year of the Bulgarian war , in 1018 , starting from Kastoria he subdued the remaining Bulgarian strongholds in the region of Servia . 
 = = Conspiracy and exile = = 
 In 1021 / 22 , however , Xiphias , now posted at Caesarea as strategos of the Anatolic Theme , fell out with Basil II because he was not allowed to accompany the Emperor on his campaign against the Kingdom of Georgia . Xiphias allied himself against the Emperor with the magnate Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos , whose father had risen in revolt in the early years of Basil II 's reign . The two men planned to kill Basil , and that one of them should take his place ; who it would be remained undecided , but it was mainly Phokas ' name and followers that lent the conspiracy weight . The conspiracy was apparently also known and supported by King George I of Georgia , who thus hoped to force Basil to abandon his invasion . When the emperor learned of the plot , however , he did not turn back , but instead sent letters to the two rebel leaders separately , aiming to sow distrust between them . Basil 's ploy bore fruit very soon , for on 15 August 1022 , Xiphias assassinated Phokas . The latter 's supporters dispersed , and the nascent rebellion collapsed . Xiphias was then forced to surrender to the Emperor 's envoy , Theophylact Dalassenos , who became the new strategos of the Anatolics . 
 Brought to Constantinople , Xiphias was tonsured and banished to Antigone , one of the Princes Islands . Following his return to the capital after his Georgian expedition , Basil II had most of his co @-@ conspirators imprisoned and their estates confiscated . The patrikios <unk> the Iberian was executed , while two imperial chamberlains were also killed : one by Basil 's own hand , and the other , who had tried to poison the Emperor , was thrown to the beasts . 
 According to the contemporary historian Yahya of Antioch , the conspirators of 1022 were released by Constantine VIII after Basil 's death in 1025 , but Xiphias remained in exile until 1028 , when the new emperor , Romanos III , released him . Xiphias , however , was by now too old and weary , and soon retired to the Stoudios Monastery . Nothing further is known of him . 
 = Satyavati = 
 Satyavati ( Sanskrit : सत ् <unk> ) ( also spelled Satyawati ) , or <unk> ( Indonesian ) was the queen of the Kuru king Shantanu of Hastinapur and the great @-@ grandmother of the Pandava and Kaurava princes ( principal characters of the Hindu epic Mahabharata ) . She is also the mother of the seer Vyasa , author of the epic . Her story appears in the Mahabharata , the Harivamsa and the Devi Bhagavata Purana . 
 Daughter of the Chedi king Vasu ( also known as <unk> Vasu ) and a cursed apsara ( celestial nymph ) <unk> @-@ fish Adrika , Satyavati was brought up as a commoner – the adopted daughter of a fisherman @-@ chieftain <unk> ( who was also a ferryman ) on the banks of the river Yamuna . Due to the smell emanating from her body she was known as Matsyagandha ( " She who has the smell of fish " ) , and helped her father in his job as a ferryman . 
 As a young woman Satyavati met the wandering rishi ( sage ) Parashara , who fathered her son Vyasa out of wedlock . The sage also gave her a musky fragrance , which earned her names like Yojanagandha ( " She whose fragrance is spread for a yojana ( 8 @-@ 9 miles ) " ) and Gandhavati ( " fragrant one " ) . 
 Later King Shantanu , captivated by her fragrance and beauty , fell in love with Satyavati . She married Shantanu on condition that their children inherit the throne , denying the birthright of Shantanu 's eldest son ( and crown prince ) Bhishma . Satyavati bore Shantanu two children , Chitrangada and Vichitravirya . After Shantanu 's death , she and her prince sons with the help of Bhishma ruled the kingdom . Although both her sons died childless , she arranged for her first son Vyasa to father the children of the two widows of Vichitravirya through niyoga . The children ( Dhritarashtra and Pandu ) became fathers of the Kauravas and Pandavas , respectively . After Pandu 's death , Satyavati went to the forest for penance and died there before witnessing the Kurukshetra War . 
 While Satyavati 's presence of mind , far @-@ sightedness and mastery of realpolitik is praised , her unscrupulous means of achieving her goals and her blind ambition are criticized . 
 = = Literary sources and names = = 
 Little is said about Satyavati in the Mahabharata ; however , later texts - the Harivamsa and the Devi Bhagavata Purana – elaborate her legend . 
 Satyavati is known by numerous names in the Mahabharata , among them <unk> , <unk> , Gandhavati , Kali , <unk> , Satya , Vasavi and Yojanagandha . The name " <unk> " – a term often used by her stepson Bhishma used to address her – means one of the <unk> ( slaves ) , or a Dasa aboriginal princess . Vasavi means " daughter of king Vasu " . Her birth name , Kali ( the dark one ) , indicates her dark complexion . Her other birth name , Satyavati , means " truthful " ; satya means " veracity " . As noted above , she was also known as Matsyagandha or <unk> in her earlier life – and <unk> ( " fragrant dark one " ) , Gandhavati and Yojanagandha in later life . 
 = = Birth and early life = = 
 According to the Harivamsa , Satyavati in her previous life was <unk> , daughter of the Pitrs ( ancestors ) and cursed to be born on earth . The Mahabharata , Harivamsa and Devi Bhagavata Purana assert that Satyavati was the daughter of a cursed apsara ( celestial nymph ) named Adrika . Adrika was transformed by a curse into a fish , and lived in the Yamuna river . When the Chedi king , Vasu ( better @-@ known as <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , was on a hunting expedition he had a nocturnal emission while dreaming of his wife . He sent his semen to his queen with an eagle but , due to a fight with another eagle , the semen dropped into the river and was swallowed by the cursed Adrika @-@ fish . Consequently , the fish became pregnant . The chief fisherman caught the fish , and cut it open . He found two babies in the womb of the fish : one male and one female . The fisherman presented the children to the king , who kept the male child . The boy grew up to become the founder of the Matsya Kingdom . The king gave the female child to the fisherman , naming her Matsya @-@ <unk> or Matsya @-@ <unk> ( " She who has the smell of fish " ) due to the fishy odor which came from the girl 's body . The fisherman raised the girl as his daughter and named her Kali ( " the dark one " ) because of her complexion . Over the course of time , Kali earned the name Satyavati ( " truthful " ) . The fisherman was also a ferryman , ferrying people across the river in his boat . Satyavati helped her father in his job , and grew up into a beautiful maiden . 
 = = Meeting with Parashara and birth of Vyasa = = 
 The Devi Bhagavata Purana narrates that when Kali ( Satyavati ) was ferrying the rishi ( sage ) Parashara across the river Yamuna , the sage wanted Kali to satisfy his lust and held her right hand . She tried to dissuade Parashara , saying that a learned Brahmin of his stature should not desire a woman who stinks of fish . She finally gave in , realizing the desperation and persistence of the sage and fearing that if she did not heed to his request , he might topple the boat midstream . Kali agreed , and told Parashara to be patient until the boat reached the bank . On reaching the other side the sage grabbed her again , but she declared that her body stank and coitus should be delightful to them both . At these words , Matsyagandha was transformed ( by the powers of the sage ) into Yojanagandha ( " she whose fragrance can be smelled from across a yojana " ) . She now smelled of musk , and so was called Kasturi @-@ <unk> ( " musk @-@ fragrant " ) . When Parashara , tormented with desire , approached her again she insisted that the act was not appropriate in broad daylight , as her father and others would see them in sex from the other bank ; they should wait till night . The sage , with his powers , shrouded the entire area in fog . Before Parashara could enjoy her , Satyavati again interrupted him to say that he would enjoy her and depart , robbing her of her virginity and leaving her shamed in society . The sage then blessed her with virgo intacta . She asked Parashara to promise her that the coitus would be a secret and her virginity intact ; the son born from their union would be as famous as the great sage ; and her fragrance and youth would be eternal . Parashara granted her these wishes and was satiated by the beautiful Satyavati . After the act , the sage bathed in the river and left , never to meet her again . The Mahabharata abridges the story , noting only two wishes for Satyavati : her virgo intacta and everlasting sweet fragrance . 
 Ecstatic with her blessings , Satyavati gave birth the same day to her baby on an island in the Yamuna . The son immediately grew up as a youth and promised his mother that he would come to her aid every time she called on him ; he then left to do penance in the forest . The son was called Krishna ( " the dark one " ) due to his colour , or <unk> ( " one born on an island " ) and would later become known as Vyasa – compiler of the Vedas and author of the Puranas and the Mahabharata , fulfilling Parashara 's prophecy . After this , Satyavati returned home to help her father . 
 = = Marriage with Shantanu = = 
 One day Shantanu , the Kuru king of Hastinapur , came to the forest on a hunting trip and was mesmerized by the musk @-@ fragrance emanating from Satyavati . <unk> by her sweet scent , Shantanu reached Satyavati 's house and , seeing her , fell in love at first sight . The king asked the fisherman @-@ chief for his daughter 's hand ; the fisherman <unk> said his daughter would marry the king if – and only if – her sons would inherit the throne . 
 The king , shocked and dejected , returned to the palace since he had already anointed his son , Devavrata , as heir apparent . Devavrata was distressed by his father 's condition ; he learned about the promise asked by the fisherman @-@ chief from a minister . Immediately , Devavrata rushed to the hut of the fisherman @-@ chief and begged for <unk> 's hand on his father 's behalf . The fisherman repeated his condition and told Devavrata that only Shantanu was worthy of Satyavati ; he had rejected marriage proposals from even <unk> like <unk> . 
 Devavrata renounced his claim to the throne in favour of Satyavati 's son , but the fisherman contended that Devavrata 's children might dispute his grandson 's claim . Intensely , Devavrata pledged the " terrible " vow of Brahmacharya - celibacy . The fisherman immediately gave Satyavati to Devavrata , who was henceforth called Bhishma ( " the terrible " ) . Bhishma presented Satyavati to Shantanu , who married her . 
 In the Devi Bhagavata Purana , Satyavati 's premarital first @-@ born , Vyasa , laments that his mother abandoned him to fate immediately after birth . He returns to his birthplace in search of his mother who , he finds out , is now the queen of Hastinapur . 
 = = Birth of children and grandchildren = = 
 After their marriage , Satyavati bore Shantanu two sons : Chitrangada and Vichitravirya . The Harivamsa tells of Bhishma recalling events after Shantanu 's death . During the period of mourning after Shantanu ’ s death , <unk> <unk> ( usurper of the throne of Panchala ) demanded that Bhishma hand over Satyavati in return for wealth . Bhishma killed <unk> <unk> , who had lost his powers because he lusted after another 's wife . However , the Mahabharata does not include this event ; it only describes Bhishma crowning Chitrangada as king under Satyavati 's command . Chitrangada was later killed by a namesake gandharva ( a celestial musician ) . 
 After Chitrangada 's death his young brother Vichitravirya was crowned king , while Bhishma ruled on his behalf ( under Satyavati 's command ) until Vichitravirya grew up . Vichitravirya married the princesses of Kashi @-@ Kosala : Ambika and Ambalika , who were won by Bhishma in a Swayamvara ( marriage choice ) . The childless Vichitravirya met with an untimely death from tuberculosis . 
 With no heir to the throne , Satyavati asked Bhishma to marry the widows of Vichitravirya ( following the practice of niyoga in its narrower sense , as a levirate marriage ) and rule as king . Bhishma refused , reminding Satyavati of the promise he made to her father and his vow of bachelorhood . He suggests that a Brahmin could be hired to father children on the widows , thus preserving the dynasty . Revealing to Bhishma the tale of her encounter with Parashara , Satyavati well knew that this was the time to call her son Vyasa to aid her . Satyavati coaxed Vyasa to have niyoga with his brother 's widows , saying : " from affection for thy brother Vichitravirya , for the perpetuation of our dynasty , for the sake of this Bhishma 's request and my command , for kindness to all creatures , for the protection of the people and from the liberality of thy heart , O sinless one , it <unk> thee to do what I say . " After convincing Vyasa , Satyavati managed ( with great difficulty ) to obtain the consent of her " virtuous " daughters @-@ in @-@ law . In the Mahabharata , Vyasa agreed immediately to the niyoga . In the Devi Bhagavata Purana version , Vyasa initially refused Satyavati 's proposal . He argued that Vichitravirya 's wives were like his daughters ; having niyoga with them was a heinous sin , through which no good could come . As a master of " realpolitik " , the hungry @-@ for @-@ grandsons Satyavati asserted that to preserve the dynasty , wrong directives by elders should be followed if they are going to reduce the sorrow of a mother . Vyasa finally agreed to that " disgusting task " , but suggested that offspring of perversity cannot be a source of joy . 
 During the menstrual period of the older queen , Ambika , Satyavati invited Vyasa to Ambika 's bedchamber . However , during sex with Vyasa , Ambika noticed his dark appearance and closed her eyes . Vyasa declared to <unk> that due to Ambika 's cruelty , her son would be blind ( but strong ) and have a hundred sons – later known as Kauravas ( descendants of Kuru ) . Satyavati considered such an heir to be an unworthy king , so she asked Vyasa to have niyoga with her other daughter @-@ in @-@ law . During their niyoga , Ambalika fell pale due to Vyasa 's grim appearance . As the result the child would be wan , Vyasa told his mother , who begged for another child . In due course , the blind Dhritarashtra and the pale Pandu were born . Satyavati again invited Vyasa to Ambika 's bedchamber ; she remembered Vyasa 's grim appearance ( and repulsive odour ) , and substituted a Shudra ( lowest caste ) maid in her place . The maid respected the sage and was not afraid of him , and Vyasa thus blessed her ; her son would be the most intelligent man , and she would no longer be a slave . Vyasa told <unk> of the deception , and then disappeared ; Vidura , an incarnation of the god Dharma , was born to the maid . 
 = = Last days = = 
 Consequently , due to Dhritarashtra 's blindness and Vidura 's birth from a maid , Pandu was crowned king of Hastinapur . However , he was cursed ( by a sage ) , renounced the kingdom and went to the forest with his wives Kunti and Madri . There , his wives had children - the Pandavas , or " sons of Pandu " - for him through niyoga with the gods . Pandu died , due to the curse , in the forest ; Madri died with him . Kunti returned to Hastinapur with the Pandavas . Satyavati was grief @-@ stricken because of Pandu 's death , and did not wish to live any longer . After the funerary rites for Pandu were done , Vyasa warned Satyavati that happiness would end in the dynasty and devastating events would occur in the future ( leading to the destruction of her kin ) , which she would not be able to bear in her old age .

 Though all the texts mention Satyavati 's fisherman father a reason of Bhishma pledge and the indirect downfall of Hastinapur ; but some @-@ well known authors consider Satyavati and not her father for both the reasons . 
 <unk> Ayyer , author of Satyavati : Blind Ambition , introduces Satyavati as " the embodiment of the driving force of womanhood , with motherly ambition blinding her vision at every turn " and further says that " [ i ] n a way , Satyavati exemplifies what Rudyard Kipling succinctly put " : 
 The female of the species must be deadlier than the male . 
 For Satyavati , the end justifies the means . Her life goal and ambition became the <unk> of succession of Shantanu 's lineage and inheritance of his fortune by her sons but ironically ( Ayyer comments ) , Bhishma - whose right to the throne was snatched because of her - outlives her children in life and in fame . Her actions ( and decisions ) indirectly create a generation encompassed by greed which ultimately leads to its annihilation . Ayyer concludes that " Satyavati 's story teaches the new generation women that determination and commitment are different from avarice and calculation . One should know where greed takes over from ambition . " 
 Pradip Bhattacharya , author of Of Kunti and Satyawati : Sexually Assertive Women of the Mahabharata , praises Satyavati 's handling of her encounter with the sage Parashara . He notes that although young , she tackles the persistent sage with great maturity and presence of mind . Bhattacharya remarks , " With a maturity and frankness that astonishes us even in the twenty @-@ first century , she points out that coitus ought to be mutually enjoyable . " She is not deluded by the belief that the sage will marry her , and asks for virginity to ensure her future status in society . Bhattacharya further comments on the sequence of her requests : the bodily fragrance to make the sexual act pleasant for both , the veil of mist to keep the act a secret , virginal status for her future and fame for her child - securing his fame and , after practical aspects are sorted out , " eternally feminine " boons of lifelong youth and fragrance . Bhattacharya says : " Modern @-@ day women could well wish that they were half as confident , clear @-@ headed and assertive of their desires and goals as Satyavati . " He further praises her " characteristic far @-@ sightedness " , when she ensures the future of her children with Shantanu by indirectly disposing of the crown prince Bhishma . She brings her illegitimate son , Vyasa , onto the scene to father sons with her dead son 's widows – turning the renowned " lunar dynasty , into the lineage of a dasa ( slave ) maiden " .

 Alfred Aloysius " Allie " Clark ( June 16 , 1923 – April 2 , 2012 ) was an American right fielder in Major League Baseball who played for seven seasons in the American League with the New York Yankees , Cleveland Indians , Philadelphia Athletics and Chicago White Sox . In 358 career games , Clark recorded a batting average of .262 and accumulated 32 home runs and 149 runs batted in ( RBIs ) . 
 Clark was born in South Amboy , New Jersey , where he attended St. Mary 's High School , and joined the New York Yankees organization after graduating . He spent the next six seasons playing minor league baseball and serving in the U.S. Army during World War II . He made his major league debut in 1947 , and after one year with the Yankees , he spent four seasons with the Cleveland Indians . He was a member of the World Champion Yankees and Indians after the two teams won the 1947 World Series and 1948 World Series , respectively . He then played with the Philadelphia Athletics and Chicago White Sox through 1953 , and played minor league baseball until 1958 . After retiring , he returned to South Amboy and resided there until his death in 2012 . 
 = = Early life and minor leagues = = 
 Clark was born in South Amboy , New Jersey on June 16 , 1923 . His parents were Alfred and Helen Clark , and he had four brothers and two sisters . He attended St. Mary 's High School in South Amboy , which is now Cardinal McCarrick High School , where he served as the baseball team 's shortstop . Clark led the 1939 baseball team to the county and state championships , and was named to the All @-@ State baseball team that year ; he has since been inducted into his high school 's athletic Hall of Fame . 
 After graduating from high school , Clark was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent . He was scouted while in high school , and was invited to a tryout in Newark , New Jersey , where he was signed to a minor league deal . Clark spent his first year in their farm system with the Easton Yankees of the Eastern Shore League and the Amsterdam <unk> of the Canadian – American League . He hit .325 for the Yankees in 70 games , and .368 in 20 games for the <unk> . In 1942 , he was promoted to the Norfolk Tars of the Piedmont League , where he spent the season as the team 's second baseman and played with future major league teammate Vic Raschi . In 129 games with the team , he hit .328 with 34 doubles . 
 The following year , Clark was promoted to the Newark Bears of the International League , having played one game for them the previous year . After playing in 24 games for the Bears , he was called to serve the United States Army in World War II . Clark served with the combat medical corps in England and France , and saw some active combat in Germany . After being discharged at the conclusion of the war , Clark returned to baseball in 1946 . He was unable to stay in baseball shape due to combat duties , and as a result of having slowed down , the Yankees organization converted him to an outfielder and third baseman . In 97 games for Newark , Clark hit .344 with 14 home runs and 70 runs batted in . 
 = = Major leagues = = 
 Clark played well enough in 1946 to earn a tryout for the 1947 New York Yankees , and competed with Frank Colman for the final outfield position . He lost the battle and began the season in Newark . Over the course of the 1947 season in Newark , he had a batting average of .334 with 23 home runs and 86 RBIs . His efforts got him noticed by the Yankees , and he made his major league debut on August 5 . Within two weeks of being called up , Clark had a streak of six straight at @-@ bats with a hit . He finished the regular season with a .373 batting average in 24 games . He was named to the 1947 World Series roster , and played in three games . In game seven , he served as a pinch hitter for Yogi Berra , hitting a single , which helped the Yankees win the World Series ; he considered this one of his greatest moments in professional baseball . 
 He wore the # 3 jersey for the New York Yankees in 1947 , and was one of the last players to wear it before it was retired in honor of Babe Ruth the following year . On December 11 , 1947 , he was traded to the Cleveland Indians for pitcher Red Embree . To begin the 1948 Cleveland Indians season , Clark was in a crowded outfield position battle , with Larry Doby , Thurman Tucker , and Wally <unk> fighting for playing time , but Clark was noted as the most interesting to watch by The Sporting News due to owner Bill Veeck 's high regard for him . The only weakness noted in his game was a sore arm from the previous season , to which Clark responded that reading the newspaper was the first time he noticed anything about a bad arm . 
 He was primarily a starter in the outfield for the first half of the season , and during the second half he split time in right field with Hank Edwards . Clark finished the year having played 81 games , most in the outfield and a few at third base , and hit .310 with nine home runs and 38 RBIs . The Indians tied with the Boston Red Sox that season and had to play a tie @-@ breaker to earn the right to play in the 1948 World Series . In that game , Indians manager Lou Boudreau placed Clark at first base , the first time he had played that position at any level . Clark then played in one game in the World Series , going hitless in four plate appearances as the Indians won the series . 
 Clark started the 1949 Cleveland Indians season primarily as a pinch hitter , having lost his platoon duties alongside Edwards to Bob Kennedy . He was used mainly as a pinch hitter throughout the year , and by August he was sent down to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League to make room for Luke Easter , finishing the year with a .176 batting average in 35 games . In 42 games with San Diego over the last two months of the season , Clark hit .295 with 11 home runs . During spring training in 1950 , Clark hit <unk> , leading to a battle with Kennedy and Easter for the right field spot . He spent the season in Cleveland as the backup in right field for Kennedy , and had a .215 batting average with six home runs in 59 games . 
 In 1951 , Clark served as a substitute outfielder for three games with the Indians after Easter was out due to injury . After those three games , he was traded to the Philadelphia Athletics along with Lou Klein for Sam Chapman . His outings that season included a four @-@ hit game against the St. Louis Browns on June 24 . In 59 total games , 56 with the Athletics , Clark had a .251 batting average in 171 at @-@ bats . He spent the 1952 Philadelphia Athletics season as the fourth outfielder after being considered for a starting outfield position alongside Elmer <unk> and Gus Zernial . In a game on June 12 , Clark ran into the outfield fence chasing a fly ball , and missed some playing time as a result . 
 Late in the 1952 season , Clark was ejected and fined $ 50 for arguing strikes in a game where Athletics Eddie Joost and manager Jimmy Dykes were also ejected ; Clark 's was the only fine not to be rescinded , a move that occurred on Dykes 's request . In 71 games , he hit .274 with seven home runs . Clark started the 1953 season with the Athletics , and started off the year with a grand slam home run in spring training against the Philadelphia Phillies in the tenth inning . In 20 games with the Athletics , Clark had a .203 batting average and 13 RBIs , which led the team when that he was sold to the Chicago White Sox in mid @-@ May . A month later , after playing in nine games for the White Sox , he was purchased by the Rochester Red Wings for $ 20 @,@ 000 , returning to the minors and ending his major league career . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Clark spent the next five seasons with the Rochester Red Wings of the International League , part of the St. Louis Cardinals organization . In 80 games in 1953 , he had a .328 batting average . He came close to making the 1954 International League All @-@ Star team , but missed the cut by four votes to Sam <unk> . He finished the year with a .323 average and 18 home runs . During the offseason when he was with Rochester , Clark also played winter baseball for various teams in the Puerto Rican League . 
 To start the 1955 season , Clark held out for a new deal because he felt that he deserved a promotion to the Cardinals ' major league roster ; he ended the holdout in March . That season , he hit .308 with 23 home runs , 84 RBIs , and was named as a finalist for the International League Most Valuable Player Award . For the next two seasons , Clark hit .289 and .285 , and he finished his time in Rochester with four straight seasons of 20 or more doubles . He ranks in the top ten in Red Wings history for RBIs ( 7th ) , home runs ( 9th ) , games played ( 9th ) , and hits ( 10th ) , and is a member of the Red Wings Hall of Fame , inducted in 1998 . He began the 1958 season with the Denver Bears , but left the team due to the distance between himself and his family . In his final year of professional baseball , he played a combined 70 games with the New Orleans Pelicans , San Antonio Missions , and Indianapolis Indians . 
 After retiring from professional baseball , Clark worked for 30 years as an employee of Iron Workers Local 373 , and served as a member of the South Amboy city council . He lived with his wife , Frances , and the two had six children together . He died on April 2 , 2012 , in South Amboy . 
 = Madonna : An Intimate Biography = 
 Madonna : An Intimate Biography is a book by American author J. Randy Taraborrelli , chronicling the life of American singer Madonna . The book was released in April 2001 by Sidgwick & Jackson in the United Kingdom , and in August 2001 by Simon & Schuster in the United States . Taraborrelli first considered writing the book in 1990 , but , realizing the project might be premature in respect to Madonna 's fledgling career , set it aside . He began writing the book in 1996 , when Madonna gave birth to her daughter Lourdes . 
 Other books about Madonna 's life and career had been based on previously published material , but Taraborrelli 's biography was the product of research spanning a decade and includes exclusive interviews with Madonna 's close friends , business associates , family members , and her father , Tony Ciccone . These interviews were conducted by the author himself , as well as his team of private investigators . Taraborrelli also interviewed Madonna over the course of years , and often drew from his first @-@ hand experiences while writing the book . Madonna : An Intimate Biography received a mixed response from critics . Some considered it a compelling piece on Madonna 's life , while others thought Taraborrelli 's writing was unprofessional . Despite the mixed response the book was a commercial success , and became a bestseller in the United Kingdom . 
 = = Summary = = 
 The book opens with Madonna 's birth , her early years in Michigan , and her 1977 move to New York City where she was involved with modern dance , two pop groups , composing , and releasing her 1983 debut album , Madonna . Her rise to superstardom as a pop icon is chronicled and her cutting edge music videos , albums , first concert tour , film roles , and marriage and divorce to Sean Penn are examined . The book investigates her controversial religious imagery and her erotic productions , Erotica , Sex , and Body of Evidence . The book describes a mellowing in her appearance and provocativeness , and , among other things , the release of her next several albums , her Golden Globe Award @-@ winning musical film portrayal of Eva Peron , and her high @-@ grossing Drowned World Tour . The births of daughter Lourdes and son Rocco , and her marriage to second husband Guy Ritchie , are chronicled . 
 = = Development = = 
 American journalist and celebrity biographer John Randall Taraborrelli first met Madonna at a press conference in 1983 . She spoke of her youthful struggles before the release of her debut album , and of her belief that she would someday enjoy great success as the " century 's biggest star " . Taraborrelli thought her brash , cocky , petulant , self @-@ indulgent , and a mediocre beauty with a voice to match . 
 Taraborrelli was proven wrong , and , in 1990 , he considered writing her biography , but put the thought aside , thinking such a venture was premature . He pointed out that " most subjects need time for evolution and personal growths , before their stories are ripe enough to put on paper . Madonna was in an ambitious , self @-@ involved phase during which nothing mattered more to her than her career . " He picked up the writing again in 1994 , but felt the same way about her , and hoped the time would come when the singer would focus on her personal life , rather than her career . A personal evolution occurred in her life with the birth of daughter Lourdes in 1996 , and it was then that Taraborrelli sensed the time was ripe to begin writing her biography . 
 = = Writing and release = = 
 Taraborrelli decided to focus on the singer 's private life ; who she really was . Many books about the superstar were based on previously published material , but Taraborrelli had ten years of research to draw upon including interviews with people who had not spoken about Madonna in public and his own interviews with the icon . Taraborrelli and his team of private investigators interviewed Madonna 's close friends , business associates , and family members including her father Silvio Ciccone . 
 While researching the book , Taraborrelli realized that one of the greatest misconceptions about Madonna was the general perception that she was cold and unemotional in her personal relationships . The opposite proved true ; Madonna was indeed emotionally vulnerable , and Taraborelli cited as an example the icon 's 1990 relationship with actor Warren Beatty . Their relationship was generally perceived as nothing more than a means to promote their film Dick Tracy , and Madonna was regarded under the circumstances as opportunistic . Taraborelli discovered however that Madonna actually had strong feelings for Beatty . The actor however was not as emotionally invested as Madonna , and the relationship ended with her heart being broken . Taraborelli observed , " So , what I think will surprise people with this story are the many times that Madonna has ended up feeling alone and rejected . She has built her entire career on an image of indestructibility . But at least in her personal life , and again , I make that distinction , because this isn 't necessarily true in her business life , she is one of the most fragile subjects I 've ever written about ... This book is really about placing her life into the proper historical context , and once again answering the why questions about her . " 
 = = Critical response = = 
 The book received mixed reviews . Caroline Foulkes wrote in The Birmingham Post : " The thing about this biography is the depths to which Taraborrelli has dug to get information on a famously controlling woman . He relates revealing anecdotes as if they were mere bagatelle , making News of the World style revelations look like kid 's stuff . If Taraborrelli were to include in his list of acknowledgments ' thanks to the maid who let me into Madonna 's bedroom to raid her underwear drawer ' , it wouldn 't be any great surprise . " She also felt that " despite the sensationalism , Taraborrelli 's writing style lets him down . Too often it descends into the kind of mush you expect from an airport novel , with the singer coming across more like a character from Shirley Conran 's Lace than a real woman . " Peter <unk> reviewed the book for the Post @-@ Tribune and felt that " the problem with writing an unauthorized tell @-@ all biography is that , in this information @-@ rich world that we live in , by the time a book gets written on somebody , most of the juicy stories are already common knowledge . To make up for that , the tell @-@ all author needs to fill his or her pages with either a thoughtful analysis of the subject at hand , or , frankly , newer and better dirt . Unfortunately , celebrity biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli does neither with his latest concoction , Madonna : An Intimate Biography . " 
 William Leith of the London Evening Standard was impressed with the biography , and noted that " the thing about Madonna is not in her sensationalism , it ’ s in the fact that how much humane she appeared in the book . Taraborrelli does a fine job of capturing the world 's most famous courtesan , in the most infamous way " , and John <unk> from Knight Ridder thought " Taraborrelli [ is ] retelling all [ the known facts about Madonna ] and more . After all , in those 10 years , the Great Woman has had two children , wed and maintained her image as a major pain in the <unk> . He does a great job of bringing forth these unknown facts . " Ward Triplet of the Kansas City Star felt that although the book is " an eerie , but compelling day by day account of Madonna , and how she became who she is , sometimes Taraborrelli feels like revealing more about his process of writing than his subject " , and Ann O ' Neil in the Los Angeles Times complimented the book for being " different " from the " regular dirt written everyday about Madonna . " 
 Sylvia Sharma from The Daily Mirror felt that " Taraborrelli 's rummage through Madge 's life can bring you to shame . This is the Madonna biography all had been waiting for , this is who she is . Not the staunch woman that we see , but a woman who is no different than one of us . " Mike Thomas from Chicago Sun @-@ Times said that " Filled with private details from Madonna 's life , Taraborrelli gives us the first in @-@ depth look at the Material Girl in more than a decade . The following outtakes from friends , former friends , Taraborrelli and Madonna herself were hand – picked for your perusing pleasure . Or displeasure . Madonna , as with all pop icons , is an acquired taste . "

 = Avro Canada CF @-@ 105 Arrow = 
 The Avro Canada CF @-@ 105 Arrow was a delta @-@ winged interceptor aircraft designed and built by Avro Canada . The Arrow is considered to have been an advanced technical and aerodynamic achievement for the Canadian aviation industry . The CF @-@ 105 ( Mark 2 ) held the promise of near @-@ Mach 2 speeds at altitudes of 50 @,@ 000 feet ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) and was intended to serve as the Royal Canadian Air Force 's ( RCAF ) primary interceptor in the 1960s and beyond . 
 The Arrow was the culmination of a series of design studies begun in 1953 examining improved versions of the Avro Canada CF @-@ 100 Canuck . After considerable study , the RCAF selected a dramatically more powerful design , and serious development began in March 1955 . Intended to be built directly from the production line , skipping the traditional hand @-@ built prototype phase , the first Arrow Mk . I , RL @-@ 201 , was rolled out to the public on 4 October 1957 , the same day as the launch of Sputnik I. Flight testing began with RL @-@ 201 on 25 March 1958 , and the design quickly demonstrated excellent handling and overall performance , reaching Mach 1 @.@ 98 . Powered by the Pratt & Whitney J75 , another three Mk . 1s were completed , RL @-@ 202 through <unk> . The lighter and more powerful Orenda Iroquois engine was soon ready for testing , and the first Mk.II with the Iroquois , RL @-@ 206 , was ready for taxi testing in preparation for flight and acceptance tests by RCAF pilots by early 1959 . 
 On 20 February 1959 , the development of the Arrow ( and its Iroquois engines ) was abruptly halted before the project review had taken place . Two months later , the assembly line , tooling , plans and existing airframes and engines were ordered to be destroyed . The cancellation was the topic of considerable political controversy at the time , and the subsequent destruction of the aircraft in production remains a topic for debate among historians and industry pundits . " This action effectively put Avro out of business and its highly skilled engineering and production personnel scattered .... " 
 = = Design and development = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 In the post @-@ Second World War period , the Soviet Union began developing a capable fleet of long @-@ range bombers with the ability to deliver nuclear weapons across North America and Europe . The main threat was principally from high @-@ speed , high @-@ altitude bombing runs launched from the Soviet Union travelling over the Arctic against military bases and built @-@ up industrial centres in Canada and the United States . To counter this threat , Western countries strenuously undertook the development of interceptors that could engage and destroy these bombers before they reached their targets . 
 A. V. Roe Canada Limited had been set up as a subsidiary of the Hawker Siddeley Group in 1945 , initially handling repair and maintenance work for aircraft at Malton , Ontario Airport , today known as Toronto Pearson International Airport . The next year the company began the design of Canada 's first jet fighter for the Royal Canadian Air Force ( RCAF ) , the Avro CF @-@ 100 Canuck all @-@ weather interceptor . The Canuck underwent a lengthy and troubled prototype stage before entering service seven years later in 1953 . Nevertheless , it went on to become one of the most enduring aircraft of its class , serving in a variety of roles until 1981 . 
 Recognizing that the delays that affected the development and deployment of the CF @-@ 100 could also affect its successor , and the fact that the Soviets were working on newer jet @-@ powered bombers that would render the CF @-@ 100 ineffective , the RCAF began looking for a supersonic , missile @-@ armed replacement for the Canuck even before it had entered service . In March 1952 , the RCAF 's Final Report of the All @-@ Weather Interceptor Requirements Team was submitted to Avro Canada . 
 = = = Higher speeds = = = 
 Avro engineering had been considering supersonic issues already at this point . Supersonic flight works in a very different fashion and presents a number of new problems . One of the most critical , and surprising , was the sudden onset of a new form of drag , known as wave drag . The effects of wave drag were so strong , that engines of the era could not provide enough power to overcome it , leading to the concept of a " sound barrier " . 
 German research during the Second World War had shown the onset of wave drag was greatly reduced by using airfoils that varied in curvature as gradually as possible . This suggested the use of thinner airfoils with much longer chord than designers would have used on subsonic aircraft . These designs were impractical because they left little internal room in the wing for armament or fuel . However , they also discovered it was possible to " trick " the airflow into the same behaviour if a conventional thicker airfoil was used , swept rearward at a sharp angle , creating a swept @-@ wing . This provided many of the advantages of a thinner airfoil while also retaining the internal space needed for strength and fuel storage . Another advantage was that the wings were clear of the supersonic shock wave generated by the nose of the aircraft . 
 Almost every fighter project in the postwar era immediately applied the concept , which started appearing on production fighters in the late 1940s . Avro engineers explored swept @-@ wing and tail modifications to the CF @-@ 100 known as the CF @-@ 103 , which had proceeded to wooden mock @-@ up stage . The CF @-@ 103 offered improved transonic performance with supersonic abilities in a dive . However , the basic CF @-@ 100 continued to improve through this period , and the advantages were continually eroded . When a CF @-@ 100 broke the sound barrier on 18 December 1952 , interest in the CF @-@ 103 waned . 
 = = = Delta wings = = = 
 Another solution to the high @-@ speed problem is the delta wing . The delta wing had many of the same advantages of the swept wing in terms of transonic and supersonic performance , but offered much more internal room and overall surface area . This provided more room for fuel , an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era , and the large wing area provided ample lift at high altitudes . The delta wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions . The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes , and especially higher drag while maneuvering . For the interceptor role these were minor concerns , as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds , mitigating these disadvantages . 
 Further proposals based on the delta wing resulted in two versions of the design known as C104 : the single engine C104 / 4 and twin @-@ engined C104 / 2 . The designs were otherwise similar , using a low @-@ mounted delta @-@ wing ; the primary advantages of the C104 / 2 were a larger overall size which offered a much larger internal weapons bay , at the time a cutting @-@ edge feature in a fighter , and gave it twin @-@ engine reliability . The proposals were submitted to the RCAF in June 1952 . 
 = = = AIR 7 @-@ 3 and <unk> = = = 
 Intensive discussions between Avro and the RCAF examined a wide range of alternative sizes and configurations for a supersonic interceptor , culminating in RCAF " Specification AIR 7 @-@ 3 " in April 1953 . AIR 7 @-@ 3 called specifically for crew of two , twin engines , with a range of 300 nautical miles ( 556 km ) for a normal low @-@ speed mission , and 200 nmi ( 370 km ) for a high @-@ speed interception mission . It also specified operation from a 6 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 830 m ) runway ; a Mach 1 @.@ 5 cruising speed at an altitude of 70 @,@ 000 ft ( 21 @,@ 000 m ) ; and manoeuvrability for 2 g turns with no loss of speed or altitude at Mach 1 @.@ 5 and 50 @,@ 000 ft . The specification required five minutes from starting the aircraft 's engines to reaching 50 @,@ 000 ft altitude and Mach 1 @.@ 5 . It was also to have turn @-@ around time on the ground of less than 10 minutes . An RCAF team led by Ray <unk> visited U.S. aircraft producers and surveyed British and French manufacturers before concluding that no existing or planned aircraft could fulfill these requirements . 
 Avro submitted their modified <unk> design in May 1953 , essentially a two @-@ man version of the C104 / 2 . A change to a " shoulder @-@ mounted " wing allowed rapid access to the aircraft 's internals , weapons bay , and engines . The new design also allowed the wing to be built as a single structure sitting on the upper fuselage , simplifying construction and improving strength . The wing design required a long main landing gear that still had to fit within the thin delta wing , presenting an engineering challenge . Five different wing sizes were outlined in the report , ranging between 1 @,@ 000 ft2 and 1 @,@ 400 ft2 ( 93 m2 to 130 m2 ) ; the 1 @,@ 200 ft2 ( 111 m2 ) sized version was eventually selected . The engines considered for the aircraft were the Bristol Olympus OL @-@ 3 , the Curtiss @-@ Wright J @-@ 67 ( a US @-@ built version of the Olympus ) , or the Orenda <unk> engines . 
 Armament was stored in a large internal bay located in a " belly " position , taking up over one third of the aircraft fuselage . A wide variety of weapons could be deployed from this bay , such as the Hughes Falcon guided missile , the <unk> Velvet Glove air @-@ to @-@ air missile , or four general @-@ purpose 1 @,@ 000 lb bombs . The Velvet Glove radar @-@ guided missile had been under development with the RCAF for some time , but was believed unsuitable for supersonic speeds and lacked development potential . Consequently , further work on that project was cancelled in 1956 . 
 In July 1953 , the proposal was accepted and Avro was given the go @-@ ahead to start a full design study under the project name : " CF @-@ 105 " . In December , CA $ 27 million was provided to start flight modelling . At first , the project was limited in scope , but the introduction of the Soviet <unk> M @-@ 4 Bison jet bomber and the Soviet Union 's testing of a hydrogen bomb dramatically changed Cold War priorities . In March 1955 , the contract was upgraded to CA $ 260 million for five Arrow Mk.1 flight @-@ test aircraft , to be followed by 35 Arrow Mk . 2s with production engines and fire @-@ control systems . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 In order to meet the timetable set by the RCAF , Avro decided that Arrow program would adopt the Cook @-@ Craigie plan ; effectively eliminating the prototype phase , the first test airframes were constructed on production jigs . Any changes would be incorporated into the jigs while testing continued , with full production starting when the test program was complete . As Jim Floyd noted at the time , this was a risky approach , however : " ... it was decided to take the technical risks involved to save time on the programme ... I will not pretend that this philosophy of production type build from the outset did not cause us a lot of problems in Engineering . However , it did achieve its objective . " 
 In order to mitigate risks , a massive testing program was started . By mid @-@ 1954 , the first production drawings were issued and wind tunnel work began , along with extensive computer simulation studies carried out both in Canada and the United States using sophisticated computer programs . In a related program , nine instrumented free @-@ flight models were mounted on solid fuel Nike rocket boosters and launched from Point Petre over Lake Ontario while two additional models were launched from the NACA facility at Wallops Island , Virginia , over the Atlantic Ocean . These models were for aerodynamic drag and stability testing , flown to a maximum speed of Mach 1 @.@ 7 + before intentionally crashing into the water . 
 Experiments showed the need for only a small number of design changes , mainly involving the wing profile and positioning . To improve high @-@ alpha performance , the leading edge of the wing was drooped , especially on outer sections , a dog @-@ tooth was introduced to control spanwise flow , and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch @-@ up . The area rule principle , made public in 1952 , was also applied to the design . This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone , sharpening the radar nose profile , thinning the intake lips , and reducing the cross @-@ sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy . 
 The aircraft used a measure of magnesium and titanium in the fuselage , the latter limited largely to the area around the engines and to fasteners . Titanium was still expensive and not widely used because it was difficult to machine . The construction of the airframe itself was fairly conventional , however , with a semi @-@ monocoque frame and multi @-@ spar wing . 
 The Arrow 's thin wing required aviation 's first 4 @,@ 000 lb / in2 ( 28 MPa ) hydraulic system to supply enough force to the control surfaces , while using small actuators and piping . A rudimentary fly @-@ by @-@ wire system was employed , in which the pilot 's input was detected by a series of pressure @-@ sensitive transducers in the stick , and their signal was sent to an electronic control servo that operated the valves in the hydraulic system to move the various flight controls . This resulted in a lack of control feel ; because the control stick input was not mechanically connected to the hydraulic system , the variations in back @-@ pressure from the flight control surfaces that would normally be felt by the pilot could no longer be transmitted back into the stick . To re @-@ create a sense of feel , the same electronic control box rapidly responded to the hydraulic back @-@ pressure fluctuations and triggered actuators in the stick , making it move slightly ; this system , called " artificial feel " , was also a first . 
 In 1954 , the <unk> program was cancelled , necessitating the use of the backup Wright <unk> engine instead . In 1955 , this engine was also cancelled , leaving the design with no engine . At this point , the Pratt & Whitney J75 was selected for the initial test @-@ flight models , while the new TR 13 engine was developed at Orenda for the production Mk 2s . 
 After evaluating the engineering mock @-@ ups and the full @-@ scale wooden mock @-@ up in February 1956 , the RCAF demanded additional changes , selecting the advanced RCA @-@ Victor Astra fire @-@ control system firing the equally advanced United States Navy Sparrow II in place of the MX @-@ 1179 and Falcon combination . Avro vocally objected on the grounds that neither of these were even in testing at that point , whereas both the MX @-@ 1179 and Falcon were almost ready for production and would have been nearly as effective for " a very large saving in cost " . The Astra proved to be problematic as the system ran into a lengthy period of delays , and when the USN cancelled the Sparrow II in 1956 , Canadair was quickly brought in to continue the Sparrow program in Canada , although they expressed grave concerns about the project as well and the move added yet more expense . 
 = = = Rollout and flight testing = = = 
 Go @-@ ahead on the production was given in 1955 . The rollout of the first CF @-@ 105 , marked as RL @-@ 201 , took place on 4 October 1957 . The company had planned to capitalize on the event , inviting more than 13 @,@ 000 guests to the occasion . Unfortunately for Avro , the media and public attention for the Arrow rollout was dwarfed by the launch of Sputnik the same day . 
 The J @-@ 75 engine was slightly heavier than the PS @-@ 13 , and therefore required ballast to be placed in the nose to return the centre of gravity to the correct position . In addition , the Astra fire @-@ control system was not ready , and it too , was replaced by ballast . The otherwise unused weapons bay was loaded with test equipment . 
 RL @-@ 201 first flew on 25 March 1958 with Chief Development Test Pilot S / L Janusz Żurakowski at the controls . Four more J75 @-@ powered Mk 1s were delivered in the next 18 months . The test flights , limited to " proof @-@ of @-@ concept " and assessing flight characteristics , revealed no serious design faults . The CF @-@ 105 demonstrated excellent handling throughout the flight envelope , a large part due to the natural qualities of the delta @-@ wing , but responsibility can also be attributed to the Arrow 's Stability Augmentation System . The aircraft went supersonic on its third flight and , on the seventh , broke 1 @,@ 000 mph ( 1 @,@ 600 km / h ) at 50 @,@ 000 ft ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) while climbing . A top speed of Mach 1 @.@ 98 was achieved , and this was not at the limits of its performance . However , an Avro report made public in 2015 clarifies that during the highest speed flight , the Arrow reached Mach 1 @.@ 90 in steady level flight , and an indicated Mach number of 1 @.@ 95 was recorded in a dive . Estimates up to Mach 1 @.@ 98 likely originated from an attempt to compensate for lag error , which was expected in diving flight . 
 Although no major problems were encountered during the initial testing phase , some minor issues with the landing gear and flight control system had to be rectified . The former problem was partly due to the tandem main landing gear being very narrow , in order to fit into the wings ; the leg shortened in length and rotated as it was stowed . During one landing incident , the chain mechanism ( used to shorten the gear ) in the Mark 1 gear jammed , resulting in incomplete rotation . In a second incident with Arrow 202 on 11 November 1958 , the flight control system commanded elevons full down at landing ; the resulting reduction in weight on the gears reduced the effective tire friction , ultimately resulting in brake lockup and subsequent gear collapse . A photograph taken of the incident proved that inadvertent flight control activation had caused the accident . The only occasion when a test flight was diverted occurred on 2 February 1959 , when a TCA Viscount crash @-@ landed in Toronto , necessitating a landing at CFB Trenton . 
 The stability augmentation system also required much fine @-@ tuning . Although the CF @-@ 105 was not the first aircraft to use such a system , it was one of the first of its kind , and was problematic . By February 1959 , the five aircraft had completed the majority of the company test program and were progressing to the RCAF acceptance trials . 
 = = = Political issues = = = 
 From 1953 , some senior Canadian military officials at the chiefs of staffs began to question the program . The chiefs of staff of the army and navy were both strongly opposed to the Arrow , since " substantial funds were being diverted to the air force " , while Air Marshal Hugh Campbell , RCAF Chief of Staff , backed it right up until its cancellation . In June 1957 , when the governing Liberals lost the federal election and a Progressive Conservative government under John Diefenbaker took power , the aircraft 's prospects began to noticeably change . Diefenbaker had campaigned on a platform of reining in what the Conservatives claimed was " rampant Liberal spending " . Nonetheless , by 1958 , the parent company had become Canada 's third largest business enterprise and had primary interests in rolling stock , steel and coal , electronics and aviation with 39 different companies under the A. V. Roe Canada banner . 
 In August 1957 , the Diefenbaker government signed the NORAD ( North American Air Defense ) Agreement with the United States , making Canada a partner with American command and control . The USAF was in the process of completely automating their air defence system with the SAGE project , and offered Canada the opportunity to share this sensitive information for the air defence of North America . One aspect of the SAGE system was the Bomarc nuclear @-@ tipped anti @-@ aircraft missile . This led to studies on basing <unk> in Canada in order to push the line further north , even though the deployment was found to be extremely costly . The missile alone was expected to cost C $ 164 million , while SAGE would absorb another C $ 107 million , not counting the cost of improvements to radar ; in all , it was projected to raise Canada 's defence spending " as much as 25 to 30 % " , according to George Pearkes , then minister of national defence . 
 Defence against ballistic missiles was also becoming a priority . The existence of Sputnik had also raised the possibility of attacks from space , and , as the year progressed , word of a " missile gap " began spreading . An American brief of the meeting with Pearkes records his concern Canada could not afford defensive systems against both ballistic missiles and manned bombers . It is also said Canada could afford the Arrow or Bomarc / SAGE , but not both . 
 By 11 August 1958 , Pearkes requested cancellation of the Arrow , but the Cabinet Defence Committee ( CDC ) refused . Pearkes tabled it again in September , and recommended installation of the Bomarc missile system . The latter was accepted but , again , the CDC refused to cancel the entire Arrow program . The CDC wanted to wait until a major review on 31 March 1959 . They cancelled the Sparrow / Astra system in September 1958 . Efforts to continue the program through cost @-@ sharing with other countries were then explored . In 1959 , Pearkes would say the ballistic missile was the greater threat , and Canada purchased Bomarc " in lieu of more airplanes " .

 = = = Foreign interest = = = 
 Canada tried to sell the Arrow to the U.S. and Britain , but had no takers . The aircraft industry in both countries was considered a national interest and the purchase of foreign designs was rare ; in this era , the Arrow was far from the only heavy high @-@ speed interceptor project to end in cancellation . 
 From 1955 onwards , the UK had shown considerable interest in the Arrow ; in April 1956 , the UK 's Air Council recommended a purchase of 144 Arrows for the RAF to serve alongside the Saunders @-@ Roe <unk> mixed power interceptor , instead of the " thin @-@ wing " Gloster Javelin then under study . Projected power plants for the RAF Arrow were the Bristol Olympus 7R - 17 @,@ 000 lbf ( 76 kN ) thrust dry , 23 @,@ 700 lbf ( 105 kN ) with reheat , the Rolls @-@ Royce Conway Stage 4 - 18 @,@ 340 lbf ( 81 @.@ 6 kN ) thrust dry , 29 @,@ 700 lbf ( 132 kN ) with reheat , and the de Havilland <unk> - 19 @,@ 500 lbf ( 87 kN ) thrust dry , 28 @,@ 000 lbf ( 120 kN ) with reheat . Procurement of the Arrow from Canada , and setting up a production line in the UK , was studied , the unit price per aircraft built in the UK being estimated at £ 220 @,@ 000 each for a production run of 100 aircraft , as opposed to the estimate of £ 150 @,@ 000 per aircraft for the " thin wing " Javelin . The CF @-@ 105 would serve as a stopgap until the UK 's <unk> project came to fruition ; however with the <unk> due in 1963 and the Arrow not likely to reach the RAF before 1962 , there was little point in proceeding . The infamous 1957 Defence White Paper , described as " the biggest change in military policy ever made in normal times " , led to the cancellation of almost all British manned fighter aircraft then in development , and completely curtailed any likelihood of a purchase . In January 1959 , the UK 's final answer was no ; Britain countered with an offer to sell Canada the English Electric Lightning . 
 Acting on media speculation that the Iroquois engine program was also in jeopardy of being cancelled , the French government , whose original intention had been to place a major order for 300 Iroquois engines for the Dassault Mirage IV bomber , chose to end negotiations in October 1958 and opted for an upgraded version of the indigenous SNECMA Atar , instead . There was never an explanation for this decision offered by the French government , even after Avro tried to offer the Iroquois as a private venture . 
 Two American advanced interceptor designs , the Republic XF @-@ 103 and North American XF @-@ 108 , were under development for the United States Air Force as part of their " 1954 Interceptor " ; when both were cancelled in the early design and mock @-@ up phases , it added weight to the justification of cancelling the Arrow . In 1958 , Avro Aircraft Limited president and general manager Fred <unk> elicited a promise from the USAF to " supply , free , the fire control system and missiles and if they would allow the free use of their flight test centre at ... Edwards AFB . " 
 = = = Cancellation = = = 
 The Arrow 's cancellation was announced on 20 February 1959 . The day became known as " black Friday " in the Canadian aviation industry . Diefenbaker claimed the decision was based on " a thorough examination " of threats and defensive measures , and the cost of defensive systems . 
 The decision immediately put 14 @,@ 528 Avro employees , as well as nearly 15 @,@ 000 other employees in the Avro supply chain of outside suppliers , out of work . Declassified records show Avro management was caught unprepared by the suddenness of the announcement by the government ; while executives were aware that the program was in jeopardy , they expected it to continue until the March review . It was widely believed during this lead @-@ up to the review , the first Arrow Mk II , RL @-@ 206 , would be prepared for an attempt at both world speed and altitude records . 
 An attempt was made to provide the completed Arrows to the National Research Council of Canada as high @-@ speed test aircraft . The NRC refused , noting that without sufficient spare parts and maintenance , as well as qualified pilots , the NRC could make no use of them . A similar project initiated by the Royal Aircraft Establishment ( Boscombe Down ) had resulted in Avro vice @-@ president ( engineering ) Jim Floyd 's preparing a transatlantic ferry operation . This proposal , like others from the United States , was never realized . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 Within two months of the project cancellation , all aircraft , engines , production tooling and technical data were ordered scrapped . Officially , the reason given for the destruction order from cabinet and the chiefs of staff was to destroy classified and " secret " materials used in the Arrow and Iroquois programs . The action has been attributed to Royal Canadian Mounted Police fears that a Soviet " mole " had infiltrated Avro , later confirmed to some degree in the Mitrokhin archives . 
 Rumours had circulated that Air Marshal W. A. Curtis , a First World War ace who headed Avro , had ignored Diefenbaker and spirited one of the Arrows away to be saved for posterity . These rumours were given life in a 1968 interview , when Curtis was asked directly if the rumour was true . He replied , " I don 't want to answer that . " He proceeded to question the wisdom of printing the story of a missing Arrow , and wondered whether it would be safe to reveal the existence of a surviving airframe only nine years later . " If it is in existence it may have to wait another 10 years . Politically it may cause a lot of trouble . " The legend endures that one of the prototypes remains intact somewhere . 
 Following the cancellation of the Avro Arrow project , CF @-@ 105 chief aerodynamicist Jim Chamberlin led a team of 25 engineers to NASA 's Space Task Group to become lead engineers , program managers , and heads of engineering in NASA 's manned space programs — projects Mercury , Gemini and Apollo . The Space Task Group team eventually grew to 32 Avro engineers and technicians , and became emblematic of what many Canadians viewed as a " brain drain " to the United States . Among the former Arrow team engineers to go south were <unk> Roberts ( NASA 's first flight dynamics officer on Project Mercury and later director of networks at the Goddard Space Flight Center ) John Hodge ( flight director and manager on the cancelled Space Station Freedom project ) , Dennis Fielder ( director of the Space Station Task Force , later the Space Station ) , Owen Maynard ( chief of the LM engineering office in the Apollo Program Office ) and Rod Rose ( technical assistant for the Space Shuttle program ) . Many other engineers , including Jim Floyd , found work in either the UK or the United States . Work undertaken by both Avro Canada and Floyd benefited supersonic research at Hawker Siddeley , Avro Aircraft 's UK parent , and contributed to programs such as the <unk> supersonic transport design studies , influential in the design of the Concorde . 
 In 1961 , the RCAF obtained 66 McDonnell CF @-@ 101 Voodoo aircraft , one of the American designs the RCAF originally rejected , to serve in the role originally intended for the Avro Arrow . The controversy surrounding this acquisition , and Canada 's acquiring nuclear weapons for the Voodoos and <unk> eventually contributed to the collapse of the Diefenbaker government in 1963 . 
 Although nearly everything connected to the CF @-@ 105 and Orenda Iroquois programs was destroyed , the cockpit and nose gear of RL @-@ 206 , the first Mk 2 Arrow , and two outer panels of RL @-@ 203 's wings were saved and are on display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa , alongside an Iroquois engine . 
 With specifications comparable to then @-@ current offerings from American and Soviet design bureaus , at the time of its cancellation , the Arrow was considered by one aviation industry observer to be one of the most advanced aircraft in the world . The Arrow 's cancellation eventually led to the end of Avro Aircraft Limited ( Canada ) and its president and general manager , Crawford Gordon Jr. was fired shortly afterward . In 1962 , the Hawker Siddeley Group formally dissolved A. V. Roe Canada and transferred all its assets to Hawker Siddeley 's newly formed subsidiary , Hawker Siddeley Canada . 
 In its planning , design and flight @-@ test programme , this fighter , in almost every way the most advanced of all the fighters of the 1950s , was as impressive , and successful as any aircraft in history . 
 The nosecone section of Avro Arrow RL @-@ 206 , currently on display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa , was smuggled out of the Avro Aircraft plant in Malton by members of the RCAF Flying Personnel Medical Establishment , a detachment of RCAF Station Downsview on Avenue Road in Toronto , where it resided for many years and was employed in high @-@ altitude work . The commanding officer of the Flying Personnel Medical Establishment , Wing Commander Roy Stubbs , provides this prologue to the former aircraft : 
 One day after a change of government , the new RCAF Chief of the Air Staff came to inspect our facilities and programs and after lunch , I asked if he would like to see something special . I showed him a piece of the Arrow ; cockpit section and engine nacelles and a few other bits . I asked him what we should do with it and he said to keep it hidden until the climate in Ottawa was right , and then he would arrange to have it placed in the National Aeronautical Museum in Ottawa . Eventually this was done and at least a bit of history was saved .

 The Arrow Mark 1 was the initial version powered by two Pratt & Whitney J75 turbojet engines that produced 23 @,@ 500 pounds @-@ force ( 105 kN ) of thrust each . The Mk 1 was used for development and flight testing . Five were completed .

 The Mk 2 version was to be fitted with the Orenda PS @-@ 13 Iroquois engines and would be evaluated by RCAF acceptance pilots as well as Avro test pilots .

The Astra / Sparrow fire control system had been terminated by the government in September 1958 with all aircraft to employ the Hughes / Falcon combination . At the time of cancellation of the entire program , the first Arrow Mk 2 , RL @-@ 206 , was ready for taxi trials ; Avro expected it to break the world speed record , but it never flew . 
 Top speed would have been limited by atmospheric frictional heating , but according to project engineer James Floyd , " [ t ] he aluminum alloy structure which we favoured was good for speeds greater than a Mach number of 2 . "

 Avro Canada had a wide range of advanced Arrow variants under development at the time of project cancellation . Frequent mention is made of an Arrow that could have been capable of Mach 3 , similar to the Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich MiG @-@ 25 . This was not the production version , but one of the design studies , and would have been a greatly modified version of the Arrow Mk 2 , featuring revised engine inlets and extensive use of carbon steel and titanium to withstand airframe heating . The Mark 2A and Mark 3 were also to have updated engines , capable of producing 39 @,@ 800 lbf ( 177 kN ) each , increasing the maximum take off weight by 7 @,@ 700 kg ( 17 @,@ 000 lb ) and flight ceiling to 70 @,@ 000 ft . 
 In 2010 , in the context of ongoing controversy surrounding the Lockheed Martin F @-@ 35 Lightning II Canadian procurement , as an alternative to continued support of the troubled F @-@ 35 , a group of individuals began lobbying Ottawa to consider domestic production of an updated version of the Avro Arrow , using modern materials and engines but keeping the Arrow 's proven " basic design " . The group feels that a modernized Arrow would out @-@ perform the F @-@ 35 in speed , range and maximum altitude , among others , while admitting that the Arrow lacks the F @-@ 35 's stealth characteristics . However in 2012 , the Harper government publicly rejected the bid , saying the redesigned Arrow program was risky , would take too long to develop , and would be too expensive .

 A replica Arrow built by Allan Jackson was used in The Arrow , a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( CBC ) production . He began building a full @-@ scale replica of the Arrow in 1989 , and was approached by the producers of the Arrow miniseries in 1996 , then about 70 % complete , who made an offer to complete the construction if the replica could be used for the production . It was used on the miniseries and several public appearances at air shows . The replica was later donated to the Reynolds @-@ Alberta Museum in his home town of Wetaskiwin , Alberta . While in a temporary outdoor collection , it was damaged in a wind storm in 2009 . It has since been repaired , but is no longer on public display . 
 The Avro Museum is building a 2 / 3rds scale , manned , high performance flying replica of the Avro Arrow ( officially known as ARROW II ) to Canadian Aviation Experimental Aircraft Regulations in order to become an airshow demonstration aircraft . Construction began in October 2007 , and by 2012 the fuselage was completed and passed its first <unk> inspection , and now has a serial number . Powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney JT @-@ 15D @-@ 4s , the ARROW II will have a top speed of approximately 500 knots and a range of 1 @,@ 800 miles . Current projections show a final cost of the project at approximately one million dollars and it is hoped that ground tests will start in about 2016 with the first flight to follow . 
 The Canadian Air and Space Museum ( CASM ) , located at the former CFB Downsview , features a full @-@ size replica Arrow built by volunteers with assistance from local aerospace firms . With a metal structure , the replica features many authentic @-@ looking components including landing gear constructed by Messier @-@ Dowty , the original Arrow primary landing gear sub @-@ contractor . Painted in the colours of Arrow <unk> , the Arrow replica was rolled out for a media event on 28 September 2006 and was on public display on 8 – 9 October 2006 to commemorate the original aircraft 's rollout in 1957 . 
 This replica is now in storage ( in the airport area ) after being displayed at the Toronto International Centre ( across the road from where the actual aircraft were built ) for a technology trade show that ran from 30 September to 4 October 2013 . The future plans for the replica as well as the other remaining aircraft in the now closed CASM is still up in the air . The museum is seeking a location near Pearson International Airport , so that it can display some time in 2015 , all of its artifacts including a partly restored Avro Lancaster bomber .

 = James Bond ( literary character ) = 
 Royal Navy Commander James Bond , CMG , RNVR , is a fictional character created by British journalist and novelist Ian Fleming in 1953 . He is the protagonist of the James Bond series of novels , films , comics and video games . Fleming wrote twelve Bond novels and two short story collections , although the last two books — The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights — were published posthumously . 
 The Bond character is a Secret Service agent , code number 007 , residing in London but active internationally . Bond was a composite character who was based on a number of commandos whom Fleming knew during his service in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II , to whom Fleming added his own style and a number of his own tastes ; Bond 's name was appropriated from American ornithologist James Bond . Bond has a number of character traits which run throughout the books , including an enjoyment of cars , a love of food and drink , and an average intake of sixty custom @-@ made cigarettes a day . 
 Since Fleming 's death in 1964 , there have been other authorised writers of Bond material , including John Gardner , who wrote fourteen novels and two novelizations ; and Raymond Benson , who wrote six novels , three novelizations and three short stories . There have also been other authors who wrote one book each , Kingsley Amis ( writing as Robert Markham ) , Sebastian Faulks , Jeffery Deaver and William Boyd , with a further instalment due in September 2015 by Anthony Horowitz . Additionally a series of novels based on Bond 's youth — Young Bond — was written by Charlie Higson . 
 As spin @-@ offs from the literary works , there was a television adaptation of the first novel , Casino Royale , in which Bond was played as an American agent . A comic strip series also ran in the Daily Express newspaper . There have been 26 Bond films ; seven actors have played Bond in these films . 
 = = Fleming 's concept of Bond = = 
 The central figure in Ian Fleming 's work was the fictional character of James Bond , an intelligence officer in the " Secret Service " . Bond was also known by his code number , 007 , and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander . 
 During World War II , Ian Fleming had mentioned to friends that he wanted to write a spy novel . It was not until 1952 , however , shortly before his wedding to his pregnant girlfriend , Ann Charteris , that Fleming began to write Casino Royale , to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials . Fleming started writing on his first book , Casino Royale , at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica on 17 February 1952 , typing out 2 @,@ 000 words in the morning , directly from his own experiences and imagination . He finished work on the manuscript in just over a month , completing it on 18 March 1952 . Describing the work as his " dreadful oafish opus " , Fleming showed it to an ex @-@ girlfriend , Clare Blanchard , who advised him not to publish it at all , but that if he did so , it should be under another name . Fleming went on to write a total of twelve Bond novels and two short story collections ; he died on the morning of 12 August 1964 . The last two books — The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights — were published posthumously . 
 = = = Inspiration for the character = = = 
 Fleming based his creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War , admitting that Bond " was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war " . Among those types were his brother , Peter , whom Fleming worshipped and who had been involved in behind the lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war . 
 Aside from Fleming 's brother , a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond 's make up , including Conrad O 'Brien @-@ ffrench , a skiing spy whom Fleming had met in Kitzbühel in the 1930s , Patrick Dalzel @-@ Job , who served with distinction in 30 AU during the war , and Bill " Biffy " Dunderdale , station head of MI6 in Paris , who wore cufflinks and handmade suits and was chauffeured around Paris in a Rolls @-@ Royce . Sir Fitzroy Maclean was another figure mentioned as a possibility , based on his wartime work behind enemy lines in the Balkans , as was the MI6 double agent Dušan Popov . 
 = = = Origins of the name = = = 
 Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist James Bond , a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies ; Fleming , a keen birdwatcher himself , had a copy of Bond 's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist 's wife that " It struck me that this brief , unromantic , Anglo @-@ Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed , and so a second James Bond was born " . 
 On another occasion Fleming said : " I wanted the simplest , dullest , plainest @-@ sounding name I could find , ' James Bond ' was much better than something more interesting , like ' Peregrine Carruthers ' . Exotic things would happen to and around him , but he would be a neutral figure — an anonymous , blunt instrument wielded by a government department . " After Fleming met the ornithologist and his wife , he described them as " a charming couple who are amused by the whole joke " . In the first draft of Casino Royale he decided to use the name James Secretan as Bond 's cover name while on missions . 
 Bond 's number — 007 — was assigned by Fleming in reference to one of British naval intelligence 's key achievements of World War I : the breaking of the German diplomatic code . One of the German documents cracked and read by the British was the Zimmermann Telegram , which was coded 0075 , and which was one of the factors that led to the US entering the war . 
 = = = Looks = = = 
 <unk> , Bond resembles the composer , singer and actor Hoagy Carmichael . In Casino Royale Vesper Lynd remarks , " Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael , but there is something cold and ruthless . " Likewise , in Moonraker , Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is " certainly good @-@ looking ... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way . That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow . Much the same bones . But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth , and the eyes were cold . " Others , such as journalist Ben Macintyre , identify aspects of Fleming 's own looks in his description of Bond . General references in the novels describe Bond as having " dark , rather cruel good looks " . 
 In the novels ( notably From Russia , with Love ) , Bond 's physical description has generally been consistent : slim build ; a three @-@ inch long , thin vertical scar on his right cheek ; blue @-@ grey eyes ; a " cruel " mouth ; short , black hair , a comma of which falls on his forehead . Physically he is described as 183 centimetres ( 6 feet ) in height and 76 kilograms ( 168 lb ) in weight . After Casino Royale , Bond also had the faint scar of the Russian <unk> letter " Ш " ( SH ) ( for <unk> : " Spy " ) on the back of one of his hands , carved by a SMERSH agent .

In Moonraker , he admits to being eight years shy of mandatory retirement age from the 00 section — 45 — which would mean he was 37 at the time . Fleming did not provide Bond 's date of birth , but John Pearson 's fictional biography of Bond , James Bond : The Authorized Biography of 007 , gives him a birth date of 11 November 1920 , while a study by Bond scholar John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921 . According to Griswold , the Fleming novels take place between around May 1951 , to February 1964 , by which time Bond was aged 42 . 
 It was not until the penultimate novel , You Only Live Twice , that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background , using a fictional obituary , purportedly from The Times . The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery 's depiction of Bond affected Fleming 's interpretation of the character . The novel reveals Bond is the son of a Scottish father , Andrew Bond , of Glencoe , and a Swiss mother , Monique Delacroix , of the Canton de Vaud . The young James Bond spends much of his early life abroad , becoming multilingual in German and French because of his father 's work as a Vickers armaments company representative . Bond is orphaned at the age of 11 when his parents are killed in a mountain climbing accident in the Aiguilles Rouges near Chamonix . 
 After the death of his parents , Bond goes to live with his aunt , Miss Charmian Bond , in the village of Pett Bottom , where he completes his early education . Later , he briefly attends Eton College at " 12 or thereabouts " , but is removed after two halves because of girl trouble with a maid . After being sent down from Eton , Bond was sent to Fettes College in Scotland , his father 's school . On his first visit to Paris at the age of 16 , Bond loses his virginity , later reminiscing about the event in " From a View to a Kill " . Fleming used his own upbringing for his creation , with Bond alluding to briefly attending the University of Geneva ( as did Fleming ) , before being taught to ski in Kitzbühel ( as was Fleming ) by Hannes Oberhauser , who is later killed in " Octopussy " . 
 In 1941 Bond joins a branch of what was to become the Ministry of Defence and becomes a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve , ending the war as a commander . Bond applies to M for a position within the " Secret Service " , part of the Civil Service , and rises to the rank of principal officer . 
 At the start of Fleming 's first book , Casino Royale , Bond is already a 00 agent , having been given the position after killing two enemy agents , a Japanese spy on the thirty @-@ sixth floor of the RCA Building at Rockefeller Center in New York City and a Norwegian double agent who had betrayed two British agents ; it is suggested by Bond scholar John Griswold that these were part of Bond 's wartime service with Special Operations Executive , a British World War II covert military organisation . In 1954 , according to the Soviet file on him in From Russia , With Love , Bond is made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George .

 = = = = Beverages = = = = 
 Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett noted that , " within the first few pages [ of Casino Royale ] Ian had introduced most of Bond 's idiosyncrasies and trademarks " , which included his looks , his Bentley and his smoking and drinking habits . The full details of Bond 's martini were kept until chapter seven of the book and Bond eventually named it " The Vesper " , after Vesper Lynd . 
 Bond 's drinking habits run throughout the series of books . During the course of On Her Majesty 's Secret Service alone , Bond consumes forty @-@ six drinks : Pouilly @-@ <unk> , <unk> and Marsala wines , most of a bottle of Algerian wine , some 1953 Château Mouton Rothschild claret , along with <unk> and Krug champagnes and Babycham ; for whiskies he consumes three bourbon and waters , half a pint of <unk> Harper bourbon , Jack Daniel 's whiskey , two double <unk> on the rocks , two whisky and sodas , two neat <unk> and one glass of neat whisky ; vodka consumption totalled four vodka and tonics and three double vodka martinis ; other spirits included two double brandies with ginger ale , a flask of <unk> <unk> and a double gin : he also washed this down with four steins of German beer . Bond 's alcohol intake does not seem to affect his performance . 
 For his non @-@ alcoholic drinks Bond eschews tea , calling it " mud " and blaming it for the downfall of the British Empire . He instead prefers to drink coffee . 
 = = = = Cuisine = = = = 
 When in England and not on a mission , Bond dines as simply as Fleming did on dishes such as grilled sole , oeufs en <unk> and cold roast beef with potato salad . When on a mission , however , Bond eats more extravagantly . This was partly because in 1953 , when Casino Royale was published , many items of food were still rationed in the UK , and Bond was " the ideal antidote to Britain 's postwar austerity , rationing and the looming premonition of lost power " . This extravagance was more noteworthy with his contemporary readers for Bond eating exotic , local foods when abroad , at a time when most of his readership did not travel abroad . 
 On 1 April 1958 Fleming wrote to The Manchester Guardian in defence of his work , referring to that paper 's review of Dr. No . While referring to Bond 's food and wine consumption as " <unk> " , Fleming bemoaned that " it has become an unfortunate trade @-@ mark . I myself abhor Wine @-@ and @-@ <unk> . My own favourite food is scrambled eggs . " Fleming was so keen on scrambled eggs that he used his short story , " 007 in New York " , to provide his favourite recipe for the dish : in the story , this came from the housekeeper of his friend Ivar Bryce , May , who gave her name to Bond 's own housekeeper . Academic Edward Biddulph observed that Fleming fully described seventy meals within the book series and that while a number of these had items in common — such as scrambled eggs and steaks — each meal was different from the others . 
 = = = = Smoking = = = = 
 Bond is a heavy smoker , at one point smoking 70 cigarettes a day . Bond has his cigarettes custom @-@ made by Morland of Grosvenor Street , mixing Balkan and Turkish tobacco and having a higher nicotine content than normal ; the cigarettes have three gold bands on the filter . Bond carried his cigarettes in a wide gunmetal cigarette case which carried fifty ; he also used a black oxidised Ronson lighter . The cigarettes were the same as Fleming 's , who had been buying his at Morland since the 1930s ; the three gold bands on the filter were added during the war to mirror his naval Commander 's rank . On average , Bond smokes sixty cigarettes a day , although he cut back to around twenty five a day after his visit to a health farm in Thunderball : Fleming himself smoked up to 80 cigarettes a day . 
 = = = = Drugs = = = = 
 Bond occasionally supplements his alcohol consumption with the use of other drugs , for both functional and recreational reasons : Moonraker sees Bond consume a quantity of the amphetamine <unk> accompanied by champagne , before his bridge game with Sir Hugo Drax ( also consuming a carafe of vintage Riga vodka and a vodka martini ) ; he also uses the drug for stimulation on missions , such as swimming across Shark Bay in Live and Let Die , or remaining awake and alert when threatened in the Dreamy Pines Motor Court in The Spy Who Loved Me . 
 = = = Attitudes = = = 
 According to academic Jeremy Black , Bond is written as a complex character , even though he was also often the voice of Fleming 's prejudices . The output of the prejudices , combined with the tales of Bond 's actions , led journalist Yuri Zhukov to write an article in 1965 for the Soviet daily newspaper Pravda , describing Bond 's values : 
 Black does not consider Bond to be the unthinking wild beast Zhukov writes about , however . From Russia , with Love sees Bond watching Kerim Bey shoot the Bulgarian killer Krilencu and Bond observing that he had never killed anyone in cold blood . In " The Living Daylights " Bond deliberately misses his target , realising the sniper he has been sent to kill is a beautiful female cello player . Bond settles this in his mind by thinking that " It wasn 't exactly murder . Pretty near it , though . " Goldfinger opens with Bond thinking through the experience of killing a Mexican assassin days earlier . He is philosophical about it : 
 In response to a reviewer 's criticism of Bond as villainous , Fleming said in a 1964 Playboy interview that he did not consider his character to be particularly evil or good : " I don 't think that he is necessarily a good guy or a bad guy . Who is ? He 's got his vices and very few perceptible virtues except patriotism and courage , which are probably not virtues anyway ... But I didn 't intend for him to be a particularly likeable person . " Fleming agreed with some critics ' characterisation of Bond as an unthinking killer , but expressed that he was a product of his time : " James Bond is a healthy , violent , <unk> man in his middle @-@ thirties , and a creature of his era . I wouldn 't say he 's particularly typical of our times , but he 's certainly of the times . " 
 Another general attitude and prejudice of Fleming 's that Bond gives voice to includes his approach to homosexuality . While Fleming had a number of gay friends , including Noël Coward and his editor , William Plomer , he said that his books were " written for warm @-@ blooded heterosexuals " . His attitude went further , with Bond opining that homosexuals were " a herd of unhappy sexual misfits – barren and full of frustrations , the women wanting to dominate and the men to be <unk> " , adding that " he was sorry for them , but he had no time for them . " 
 = = = Personal life = = = 
 Bond lives in a flat off the King 's Road in Chelsea . His flat is looked after by an elderly Scottish housekeeper named May . May 's name was taken from May Maxwell , the housekeeper of Fleming 's close friend , the American Ivar Bryce . In 1955 Bond earned around £ 2 @,@ 000 a year net ( equivalent to £ 47 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) although when on assignment he worked on an unlimited expense account . Much of Fleming 's own daily routine while working at The Sunday Times was woven into the Bond stories and he summarised it at the beginning of Moonraker : 
 Only once in the series does Fleming install a partner for Bond in his flat , with the arrival of Tiffany Case , following Bond 's mission to the US in Diamonds Are Forever . By the start of the following book , From Russia , With Love , Case had left to marry an American . Bond was married only once , in On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , to Teresa " Tracy " di Vicenzo , but their marriage ends tragically when she is killed on their wedding day by Ernst Stavro Blofeld . 
 In the penultimate novel of the series , You Only Live Twice , Bond suffers from amnesia and has a relationship with an Ama diving girl , Kissy Suzuki . As a result of the relationship Kissy becomes pregnant , although she does not reveal this to Bond before he leaves the island . 
 = = = Abilities = = = 
 From Casino Royale to From Russia , with Love Bond 's preferred weapon is a .25 ACP Beretta automatic pistol carried in a light @-@ weight chamois leather holster . However Fleming was contacted by a Bond enthusiast and gun expert , Geoffrey Boothroyd , who criticised Fleming 's choice of firearm for Bond and suggested a Walther PPK <unk> instead . Fleming used the suggestion in Dr. No , also taking advice that it should be used with the Berns @-@ Martin triple draw shoulder holster . By way of thanks , the Secret Service Armourer who gives Bond his gun was given the name Major Boothroyd , and is introduced by M as " the greatest small @-@ arms expert in the world " . 
 Kingsley Amis , in The James Bond Dossier , noted that although Bond is a very good shot and the best in the Secret Service , he is still beaten by the instructor , something that added realism to Bond 's character . Amis identified a number of skills where Bond is very good , but is still beatable by others . These included skiing , hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat , underwater swimming and golf . Driving was also an ability Amis identified where Bond was good , but others were better ; one of those who is a better driver than Bond is Sir Hugo Drax , who causes Bond to write off his battleship @-@ grey supercharged Bentley 4 ½ Litre . Bond subsequently drives a Mark II Continental Bentley , which he uses in the remaining books of the series , although he is issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device during the course of Goldfinger . 
 = = Continuation Bond works = = 
 = = = John Gardner = = = 
 In 1981 writer John Gardner was approached by the Fleming estate and asked to write a continuation novel for Bond . Although he initially almost turned the series down , Gardner subsequently wrote fourteen original novels and two novelizations of the films between Licence Renewed in 1981 and COLD in 1996 . With the influence of the American publishers , Putnam 's , the Gardner novels showed an increase in the number of Americanisms used in the book , such as a waiter wearing " pants " , rather than trousers , in The Man from Barbarossa . James Harker , writing in The Guardian , considered that the Gardner books were " dogged by silliness " , giving examples of Scorpius , where much of the action is set in Chippenham , and Win , Lose or Die , where " Bond gets chummy with an unconvincing Maggie Thatcher " . Ill health forced Gardner to retire from writing the Bond novels in 1996 . 
 Gardner stated that he wanted " to bring Mr Bond into the 1980s " , although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them . Even though Gardner kept the ages the same , he made Bond grey at the temples as a nod to the passing of the years . Other 1980s effects also took place , with Bond smoking low @-@ tar cigarettes and becoming increasingly health conscious . 
 The return of Bond in 1981 saw media reports on the more politically correct Bond and his choice of car — a Saab 900 Turbo ; Gardner later put him in a Bentley Mulsanne Turbo . Gardner also updated Bond 's firearm : under Gardner , Bond is initially issued with the Browning 9mm before changing to a Heckler & Koch <unk> and then a Heckler & Koch P7 . Bond is also revealed to have taken part in the 1982 Falklands War . Gardner updated Fleming 's characters and used contemporary political leaders in his novels ; he also used the high @-@ tech apparatus of Q Branch from the films , although Jeremy Black observed that Bond is more reliant on technology than his own individual abilities . Gardner 's series linked Bond to the Fleming novels rather than the film incarnations and referred to events covered in the Fleming stories . 
 = = = Raymond Benson = = = 
 Following the retirement of John Gardner , Raymond Benson took over as Bond author in 1996 ; as the first American author of Bond it was a controversial choice . Benson had previously written the non @-@ fiction The James Bond Bedside Companion , first published in 1984 . Benson 's first work was a short story , " Blast From the Past " , published in 1997 . By the time he moved on to other projects in 2002 , Benson had written six Bond novels , three novelizations and three short stories . His final Bond work was The Man with the Red Tattoo , published in 2002 . 
 Benson followed Gardner 's pattern of setting Bond in the contemporary timeframe of the 1990s and , according to Jeremy Black , had more echoes of Fleming 's style than John Gardner , he also changed Bond 's gun back to the Walther PPK , put him behind the wheel of a Jaguar <unk> and made him swear more . James Harker noted that " whilst Fleming 's Bond had been an Express reader ; Benson 's is positively red top . He 's the first to have group sex ... and the first to visit a prostitute " , whilst Black notes an increased level of crudity lacking in either Fleming or Gardner . In a 1998 interview Benson described his version of Bond as a more ruthless and darker character , stating that " Bond is not a nice guy . Bond is a killer ... He is an anti @-@ hero . "

 In 1967 , four years after Fleming 's death , his literary executors , Glidrose Productions , approached Kingsley Amis and offered him £ 10 @,@ 000 ( £ 163 @,@ 689 in 2016 pounds ) to write the first continuation Bond novel . The result was Colonel Sun published in 1968 under the pen @-@ name Robert Markham . Journalist James Harker noted that although the book was not literary , it was stylish . Raymond Benson noted that Bond 's character and events from previous novels were all maintained in Colonel Sun , saying " he is the same darkly handsome man first introduced in Casino Royale " . 
 = = = = Sebastian Faulks = = = = 
 After Gardner and Benson had followed Amis , there was a gap of six years until Sebastian Faulks was commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to write a new Bond novel , which was released on 28 May 2008 , the one hundredth anniversary of Ian Fleming 's birth . The book — entitled Devil May Care — was published in the UK by Penguin Books and by Doubleday in the US . 
 Faulks ignored the timeframe established by Gardner and Benson and instead reverted to that used by Fleming and Amis , basing his novel in the 1960s ; he also managed to use a number of the cultural touchstones of the sixties in the book . Faulks was true to Bond 's original character and background too , and provided " a <unk> hero " who drove a battleship grey 1967 T @-@ series Bentley . 
 = = = = Jeffery Deaver = = = = 
 On 26 May 2011 American writer Jeffery Deaver , commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications , released Carte Blanche . Deaver restarted the chronology of Bond , separate from the timelines of any of the previous authors , by stating he was born in 1980 ; the novel also saw Bond in a post @-@ 9 / 11 agency , independent of either MI5 or MI6 . 
 Whilst the chronology changed , Deaver included a number of elements from the Fleming novels , including Bond 's tastes for food and wine , his gadgets and " the rather preposterous names of some of the female characters . "

 In 2005 author and comedian Charlie Higson released <unk> , the first of five novels and one short story in the life of a young James Bond ; his final work was the short story " A Hard Man to Kill " , released as part of the non @-@ fiction work , Danger Society : The Young Bond Dossier , the companion book to the Young Bond series . Young Bond is set in the 1930s , which would fit the chronology with that of Fleming . 
 Higson stated that he was instructed by the Fleming estate to ignore all other interpretations of Bond , except the original Fleming version . As the background to Bond 's childhood , Higson used Bond 's obituary in You Only Live Twice as well as his own and Fleming 's childhoods . In forming the early Bond character , Higson created the origins of some of Bond 's character traits , including his love of cars and fine wine . 
 = = Adaptations = = 
 Adaptations of Bond started early in Fleming 's writings , with CBS paying him <unk> ( <unk> in 2016 dollars ) to adapt his first novel , Casino Royale , into a one @-@ hour television adventure ; this was broadcast on 21 October 1954 . The Bond character , played by Barry Nelson , was changed to " Card Sense " Jimmy Bond , an American agent working for " Combined Intelligence " . 
 In 1957 the Daily Express newspaper adapted Fleming 's stories into comic strip format . In order to help the artists , Fleming commissioned a sketch to show how he saw Bond ; illustrator John McLusky considered Fleming 's version too " outdated " and " pre @-@ war " and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look . 
 In 1962 Eon Productions , the company of Canadian Harry Saltzman and American Albert R. " Cubby " Broccoli released the first cinema adaptation of an Ian Fleming novel , Dr. No , featuring Sean Connery as 007 . Connery was the first of seven actors to play Bond on the cinema screen , six of whom appeared in the Eon series of films . As well as looking different , each of the actors has interpreted the role of Bond in a different way . 
 = Snuppy = 
 Snuppy ( Korean : <unk> a portmanteau of " SNU " and " puppy " ; born April 24 , 2005 ) is an Afghan hound , credited with being the world 's first cloned dog . The puppy was created using a cell from an ear from an adult Afghan hound and involved 123 surrogate mothers , of which only three produced pups ( Snuppy being the sole survivor ) . Department of <unk> and biotechnology at Seoul National University for cloning Snuppy was led by Dr. Byeong Chun Lee . Snuppy has since been used in the first known successful breeding between cloned canines , after his sperm was used to artificially inseminate two cloned females , which resulted in the birth of 10 puppies in 2008 . 
 = = History = = 
 After Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1996 , scientists had managed to clone numerous other animals , including cats , cows , gaur , horses , mice , mules , pigs , rabbits and rats but had been unable to successfully clone a dog due to the problematic task of maturing a canine ovum in an artificial environment . After several failed attempts by other scientists , Byeong Chun Lee , a professor of Seoul National University , were able to successfully create a clone using tissue from the ear of a 3 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan hound . 123 surrogate mothers were used to carry the embryos , of which 1 @,@ 095 were implanted , the procedure resulted in only three pregnancies ; one resulted in a miscarriage , the other pup was born successfully but died of pneumonia three weeks after birth , the successful clone was carried by a Labrador Retriever . From the original 1 @,@ 095 embryos to the final two puppies , this placed the success rate of the project at less than two tenths of a percent . Snuppy was named as a portmanteau of the initials of the Seoul National University ( SNU ) and the word " puppy " . 
 = = Process = = 
 As the eggs in a female canine are only fertile during the estrus phase of the estrous cycle , the eggs could only be harvested during a three @-@ week period each year . Due to complexities with removing eggs from canine ovaries the eggs had to be extracted from the oviduct , which required constant monitoring to achieve . The nucleus of each egg was replaced with the cell from the ear of the adult dog and then electrified and fused using a chemical reaction . The embryos were then transferred to the surrogate dogs . Three of the surrogate mothers became pregnant and two successfully gave birth . Snuppy , the first to be born , survived while the other died two weeks after birth . This process of cloning Snuppy took nearly three years of intensive effort . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 Snuppy was named as Time Magazine 's " Most Amazing Invention " of the year in 2005 . Particular recognition was given to the cloning technique used in the process , which Time stated was " embodied by a history @-@ making puppy " . Despite numerous labs performing mammalian cloning , they cited that Hwang 's team and Snuppy were " extraordinary " . The experiment was criticised by Robert <unk> , director of Columbia University 's Masters in Bioethics program , who cited that the process raised the question of if humans are " just a mass of cells and biological processes ? " Hwang himself criticised the process , stating that it did not bring science any closer to human cloning and the complexities , coupled with the low success rate ( one in 123 ) , did not make it ethical to clone family pets . Ian <unk> , the scientist behind the successful cloning of Dolly the sheep , said that the successful cloning of Snuppy proved that any mammal could be cloned in the correct environments and that a global ban on human cloning needed to be quickly implemented because of this . The Kennel Club criticised the entire concept of dog cloning , on the grounds that their mission is to " To promote in every way the general improvement of dogs " and no improvement can occur if replicas are being created . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 Between late 2005 – 2006 Hwang was accused of a series of misconducts . The first allegations related to his work prior to Snuppy ; the claim that he had successfully cloned a human embryo . The charges alleged Hwang had paid for egg donations and that some of eggs came from his employees , which constitute serious breaches of the code of bioethics . It was later found that photographs he published did not depict what was suggested and that most of the stem @-@ cell lines he claimed to have created were not clones at all . This brought serious doubts onto the validity of Snuppy , which Hwang consistently claimed was a genuine clone . Hwang hired <unk> Inc . , a Korean DNA lab to investigate Snuppy , who found that Snuppy was authentic . The findings by <unk> were dismissed on the grounds that they were employed by Hwang , and a panel at the Seoul National University ordered their own investigation . The investigation found that , despite his fabrications in previous projects , Hwang 's research related to Snuppy was accurate and Snuppy was a clone of the adult Afghan hound . As a result of his forgeries , Hwang was indicted for fraud and dismissed from the university .

 Veterinary professor Byeong Chun Lee took over leadership of the team behind Snuppy . In 2008 , Snuppy became involved in the first known successful breeding between cloned canines , after sperm taken from Snuppy was used to artificially inseminate two cloned females , which resulted in the birth of 10 puppies . Nine of the puppies survived . The SNU team , under Lee , have gone on to successfully clone over 30 dogs and five wolves . After successfully breeding the cloned wolves , Lee claimed that the ability to breed cloned canines makes it possible for working dogs which are usually sterilised before training , such as sniffer dogs and guide dogs , to reproduce . SNU , which claimed to own the patent for the process used to clone Snuppy , formed a license agreement with RNL Bio , a commercial pet cloning company . Hwang entered into a partnership with RNL Bio 's competitor , <unk> International , which caused an ongoing legal battle into who owns the patent rights although Bio Arts withdrew from dog cloning in 2009 . RNL completed the first commercial cloning in August 2008 but ran into financial trouble in 2013 . 
 The world 's first cloned sniffer dogs ( all of which are named <unk> ) were put to work by South Korean customs in July 2009 . 
 Supporters of Hwang founded a company called <unk> Biotech where Hwang developed proprietary techniques based on a licence from <unk> 's subsidiary Start Licensing ( which owns the original Dolly patent ) and created cloned dogs for owners whose dogs had died , charging $ 100 @,@ 000 a time <unk> Biotech was reported to have cloned 700 dogs by 2015 and to be producing 500 cloned embryos of various species a day in 2016 .

 " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " is a song by American singer Madonna from her twelfth studio album , MDNA ( 2012 ) . It features guest vocals by rappers Nicki Minaj and M.I.A. The song was written and produced by Madonna and Martin Solveig , with additional writing by M.I.A. , Minaj and Michael Tordjman . After working with Solveig on one song , Madonna continued recording others including " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " . Madonna chose to work with M.I.A. and Minaj on the track , since she felt they were both strong women with a unique voices , she liked their music and what they represented . 
 A demo version of the song , titled " Give Me All Your Love " , was leaked on November 8 , 2011 resulting in a man from Spain being arrested for copyright violations . The final version of the song was released on February 3 , 2012 , as the lead single from MDNA . The track was her debut single from her three @-@ album deal with Interscope Records . Backed by bouncing synthesizers , marching drums and a cheer , " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " is a dance @-@ pop song , with elements of new wave and disco . Madonna executes the chorus in high @-@ pitched vocals while during its dubstep breakdown , Minaj raps her verse as her alter @-@ ego Roman Zolanski , followed by M.I.A. rapping her verse . 
 " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " received mixed reviews from music critics . Its chorus was noted as a highlight by critics , who described it as catchy ; however , they felt that the musical composition was inferior to Madonna 's previous singles . Commercially , the song attained success peaking at number one in Canada , Finland and Hungary , and inside the top ten in several European countries . In the United States , it became Madonna 's 38th top @-@ ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart , extending her record as the artist with most top @-@ ten singles in the chart 's history . 
 The song 's accompanying music video featuring both Minaj and M.I.A. was directed by Megaforce . It shows Madonna , Minaj and M.I.A. along with cheerleaders wearing <unk> masks and football players . Madonna first performed the song with Minaj and M.I.A. at the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show . During the performance M.I.A. extended her middle finger towards the camera while rapping her verse . She was criticized in the media and broadcaster NBC and the National Football League ( NFL ) issued apologies . They also fined the rapper which was resolved through a confidential agreement . Later that year , Madonna also performed " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " wearing a majorette outfit on The MDNA Tour .

 In December 2010 , Madonna posted a message on her Facebook , exclaiming : " Its official ! I need to move . I need to sweat . I need to make new music ! Music I can dance to . I 'm on the lookout for the maddest , sickest , most badass people to collaborate with . I 'm just saying " . One of the collaborators was French DJ and producer Martin Solveig , who was invited to a writing session by Madonna in London in July 2011 . Originally , Madonna wanted to work with Solveig on one song , but eventually it turned into three tracks — " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " , " I Don 't Give A " , and " Turn Up the Radio " . In an interview with Billboard , Solveig explained that Madonna had enough time for the project , hence after working on one song , they continued recording . Solveig described the sessions as fun and labeled them a " privileged time " . 
 " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " was written by Madonna , Martin Solveig , Nicki Minaj , M.I.A. , and Michael Tordjman , while production was helmed by Madonna and Solveig . Madonna had wanted to work with M.I.A. and Minaj on a song , since she felt that they are both " strong women with a unique voices " . She paid tribute to the stars , saying " [ Minaj and M.I.A. are ] not conventional pop stars and I really admire them both " . M.I.A. confirmed the collaboration on her Twitter account , saying that she had been asked to come to New York City on November 29 , 2011 . The rapper felt that the collaboration was an achievement her mother would be proud of , " way [ more ] than me putting ' Galang ' out in a club . " 
 On November 8 , 2011 , a demo version of the song , named " Give Me All Your Love " , was leaked . According to Keith Caulfield from Billboard , " Within a few hours , [ the song and its leak ] was among one of the top 10 trending topics worldwide on Twitter . " Madonna 's manager , Guy Oseary , addressed the leak on Twitter adding the singer 's statement on the situation : " My true fans wouldn 't do this " . Oseary also clarified that their initial plan was for new music to come out in 2012 itself . He was happy with the positive reaction to the demo , but asked fans to help him police any more leaks . The leaked demo lacked vocals from both Minaj and M.I.A. which Madonna reflected upon , " It 's really disappointing because you don 't want things to come out till you 're done with them , till you 're ready . It 's like everybody looking at your unfinished painting . It 's like , ' Wait a minute . I didn 't finish that . That 's not fair . " 
 On December 22 , 2011 , the police arrested a 31 @-@ year @-@ old man from Spain who had reportedly leaked the demo . They confirmed the suspect 's initials as <unk> and described him as " a big Madonna fan " ; they found recordings of the song in his belongings . He was arrested in Zaragoza , charged and subsequently released , pending a trial . It was confirmed by The Huffington Post that the person did not seek to achieve a profit from the release . In 2014 , several demos from Madonna 's thirteen studio album Rebel Heart leaked and an Israeli hacker named Adi Lederman was arrested : the indictment papers said that Lederman was also responsible for the leak of " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " . 
 A month later , Interscope Records announced that the song would be released on February 3 , 2012 , three days before she was to perform at the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show . The track was her debut single from her three @-@ album deal with Interscope Records . Along with the announcement Madonna revealed the cover art for the single .

 = = Recording and composition = = 
 " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " was recorded at MSR Studios , New York City and Sarm West Studios , Notting Hill , London . Demacio " Demo " Castellon recorded and mixed the track . Philippe Weiss and Graham Archer assisted Castellon on the recording , while Angie Teo assisted on the mixing . Jason " Metal " Donkersgoed did the additional editing of the song and Jean Baptiste <unk> played guitars . Alongside his producing duty , Solveig also arranged the synths and drums for the track . He recalled that the track was recorded in two days , with Madonna and him continuously discussing the chord progression and the music . The initial version of the song 's breakdown was " too much " of dubstep , which Madonna asked him to change , while adding Minaj and M.I.A. ' s rapping over them . 
 " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " is a dance @-@ pop song , with elements of new wave and disco . The song starts with a cheer : " L @-@ U @-@ V Madonna , Y @-@ O @-@ U you wanna " with the vocal tone reminiscent off Gwen Stefani 's single " Hollaback Girl " ( 2005 ) and " Mickey " ( 1982 ) by Toni Basil . A " polished 60s shakedown " succeeds the chant , which is backed by bouncing synthesizers and hard drums . Priya Elan of NME said that the composition resembled Madonna 's own songs like " Beautiful Stranger " ( 1999 ) , " Amazing " ( 2000 ) and the songs on her studio albums , Ray of Light ( 1998 ) and Hard Candy ( 2008 ) . 
 The chorus of the song follows , which Madonna performs in a high @-@ pitched voice : " Don 't play the stupid game / Cause I ’ m a different kind of girl / Every record sounds the same / You ’ ve got to step into my world / Give me all your <unk> ' , give me your love / Give me all your love today . " Entertainment Weekly 's Lanford Beard observed that the song " blends Katy Perry @-@ meets @-@ Gwen Stefani chanting , echoes of Ashlee Simpson 's regrettable foray into New Wave @-@ y synth @-@ guitar sounds , and a ' Hold It Against Me ' redux breakdown . " John Mitchell of MTV News commented that the instrumentation of the song consists of " glittery synths , marching band drums , claps and a catchy @-@ as @-@ hell chorus . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called the song an " ' 80s @-@ inspired electro @-@ thumper complete with a cheerleader chant of ' L @-@ U @-@ V Madonna ! ' " " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " is written in the key of D ♭ major and has a moderately fast tempo of 144 beats per minute . It follows a basic chord progression of D ♭ – G ♭ – A ♭ in the verses , and D ♭ – F ♭ – C ♭ – G ♭ in the chorus and intermediate bridge . Madonna 's vocals span from the tonal nodes of C ♭ 4 to A ♭ 4 . 
 After the leak of the song in November 2011 , media reported on the similarities between the song and singer Nicola Roberts ' " Beat of My Drum " , due to the " cheerleader @-@ style " verses in both . " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " has the lyrics " L @-@ U @-@ V Madonna " while Roberts track features the lyrics " L.O.V.E / Dance to the beat of my drum " . Soon after , Roberts called Madonna a " copycat " for the alleged similarities between the songs . However , she later insisted that people had been " quick to jump the gun " and claimed she had not even heard the song . Brazilian music producer Joao Brasil alleged that the chorus of " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " was plagiarized from his 2011 single " L.O.V.E Banana " . Both songs start with the shouts of cheerleaders , who in Brazil 's song say " L.O.V.E Banana " and in Madonna 's song , " <unk> Madonna " .

 " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " met with generally mixed reviews from music <unk> . Priya Elan from NME said the song " seems to soar effortlessly " and that " what Madonna 's doing in this song is so much more impossibly fun than we could have imagined . " She also stated the song was a progress from the sound of her previous album , Hard Candy . Jim Farber from the New York Daily News considered that the song is " a pure snap of bubble gum , closer to an early single like ' Burning Up ' than any of her more recent club hits . Only the rap cameos from the quite camp Nicki Minaj , and the less so M.I.A. , tell us what decade we 're in . " Michael Cragg from The Guardian felt that the track was not bad . " Musically it 's a pretty joyful four minutes , featuring bouncing beats , acoustic riffs and Gwen Stefani @-@ style cheerleader chants , but there 's something a bit flat about Madonna 's delivery . Given all the love she 's demanding , you 'd think she 'd be more excited . " Speaking of the rap part , he thought that " Minaj certainly does her best , her typically frantic rap an exercise in squeezing as many words into a 10 @-@ second space as possible , while MIA 's more laconic drawl loses momentum . " Chris Willman of Reuters called it " risible " and infectious : " Everything here is as dumb as the titular spelling , but the campiness has its charm , at least if you like the old musicals that some of the tracking shots here are paying homage to " . MTV News journalist Bradley Stern wrote about the " Hey Mickey " comparisons , complimenting the guest rapping of Minaj and M.I.A. even though he felt it was " one of the album ’ s least compelling moments " . In a review of MDNA , Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph felt that the prime purpose of the " lightest , <unk> track " from the album was to represent next generation 's female pop stars . Emily Mackay of The Quietus wrote in detail about the song : 
 After the first play of this album , I sat down and had a hard think about which of those songs I 'd want to play again first . The only one that stuck in the head most was ' Give Me All Your Luvin ' ' , whose cheerleader chants and <unk> rhythm are kind of excruciating , but at least catchy . Minaj and M.I.A. are as effortlessly awesome as they can both be when limited to just a few lines . Say what you like about Maya , but she sounds a deal more plausible that Madonna herself on a line like ' Imma say this once , hey I don 't give a shit ' ... Oddly , for a single so tame , Madonna seems to see it as a challenge ' Every record sounds the same , you 've got to step into my world ' ? We 're already in your bloody world ! It was kind of your responsibility to step out of it and make a record that didn 't sound the same , so don 't bloody badger us about it . 
 Andrew Hampp from Billboard negatively reviewed the signing of Minaj and M.I.A. as guest artists , adding that " It 's a subpar effort from all parties , particularly Madonna , who hasn 't sounded this robotic since the more tweaked @-@ out moments on Hard Candy . " In another review , Keith Caulfield from the same magazine deemed the track as a commercial for Madonna 's Super Bowl appearance , rather than being a promotional tool for MDNA , criticizing it for misleading the listener about the vibe of the album . Gareth Grundy from The Guardian shared this view , while describing the track as " clumsy rave @-@ pop " . Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone rated it two out of five stars , describing its lyrics and composition as " dashed off " and " in the doldrums " , and was displeased by the track 's " aggressive , assaultive spunkiness " . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine described the song as " decidedly vapid " and " catchy " but also stated that " its few charms — ' 60s surf @-@ pop guitar , vintage video @-@ game effects , and references to her past songs — are fleeting at best . " He felt that Minaj and M.I.A. were " tacked on for added marketability " and that the song actually lacked " authenticity " . While reviewing MDNA , The New York Times ' critic Jon Pareles described the song as " one of the album 's weakest tracks " . Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle wrote that the song 's " shiny @-@ happy " sound is " nowhere near representative of the full album . " 
 Alexis Petridis from The Guardian listed the song as the weakest effort on MDNA , adding that " its position as the album 's lead single seems to have had more to do with showing off the presence of Nicki Minaj and M.I.A. than its featherweight melody . " A writer for Virgin Media gave the song three out of five stars , writing : " Like most Madonna singles , it skips along at a furious pace with a gleam in its eye , but the self @-@ references get tiresome and ultimately she is just trying too hard . " Nick Levine , writing for The National , relegated the track as a " lighter pop morsel " . Matthew Parpetua from Pitchfork Media panned the song , saying that Solveig 's production on the track was paired with equally " bland lyrics " . Brad O 'Mancey from Popjustice declared that the track was " proof that sometimes you can listen to something many , many times and still not have any idea whether it 's any good or not . " Chicago Tribune journalist Greg Kot was disappointed with the song and its lyrics , which he found to be meaningless , while Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald relegated it as " trite and disposable " . Alex Macpherson from Fact found the song to be " sheer misconceived awfulness " .

 On December 8 , 2011 , Minaj tweeted that she was on set with Madonna filming the music video for " Give Me All Your Luvin " . She also said that Madonna kissed her on the lips , as a gift for her birthday . M.I.A. then tweeted about filming the video with Madonna , saying , " Madonna killed it ! A legend ! said she 'd have me , I said ill have her too " . Directed by the team Megaforce — which consists of Léo Berne , Charles <unk> , Raphaël Rodriguez and Clément Gallet — the video has a football and cheerleader theme , inspired by her then @-@ upcoming Super Bowl halftime performance . Rodriguez explained to MTV News that they discussed the song with Solveig and understood that the video should be " about happiness and something really sunny " . The whole look was also dictated by the fact that Megaforce had never collaborated with Madonna , Minaj and M.I.A. , feeling that it was a " different universe " for them . The video was shot for over two days in New York , with very strict timings which Megaforce found as challenging . Describing the process as like working with the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , Megaforce told Swedish newspaper 20 minutes that the set was surrounded by police patrol and security guards and mobile phones were not allowed . A total budget of US $ 1 @.@ 5 million was allotted for the video . Some of the sequences in the video was Madonna 's idea like one scene featuring her dancing in front of a wall , which Megaforce felt would not go with the main narrative . However , the singer insisted on keeping it and by the second day of filming she wrapped up early and left . 
 <unk> was applied during post @-@ production where Minaj wanted her body to look like a plastic doll . Production for the music video was handled by US based company Bureau and UK based Riff Raff Films . Paris based visual effects , animation and motion design studio <unk> was given the task of adding the graphics on the video . A team of 14 artists worked for two weeks in Paris to finish the task , accompanied by Megaforce . Different methods used included rotoscoping and keying for creating artificial fireworks and sparkling rain , 3D and 2D backgrounds , set @-@ extensions , buildings , as well as the sky which they created using Autodesk Maya . Costumes worn in the video included Adidas uniforms for Minaj and M.I.A. and a retro inspired look for a sequence , wearing white lace dresses reminiscent of Madonna 's look in her music video for " Like a Virgin " ( 1984 ) , as well as Marilyn Monroe . Another ensemble for Madonna included a crop top , leopard printed bra and a huge cross across her neck . Dress designer for the video was Arianne Phillips with cloths provided by brands like Burberry , Dolce & Gabbana , Bebe , Norma Kamali and jewelry from Swarovski , vintage Yves Saint Laurent , Prada and Eddie Borgo .

 Madonna had first previewed the video in an American Idol exclusive on February 2 , 2012 , and the full video premiered the next day on her YouTube channel . The video starts as the words " Fans can make you famous , a contract can make you rich , the press can make you a superstar , but only <unk> [ sic ] can make you a player " appear on a brick wall . Cheerleaders M.I.A. and Minaj then sing the opening lyrics in a suburban neighborhood alongside other cheerleaders wearing <unk> masks . Madonna sings the first verse as she exits a house with a baby stroller and wears a trench coat and sunglasses , all of which are soon discarded . Emerging football players protect her from obstacles , golden raindrops and destroy a car that gets in her way . They hold her perpendicular to a wall and she walks horizontally . Throughout the video , Madonna can be seen dancing and singing in front of a brick wall , and in one scene she holds a baby doll . 
 During the second verse , Madonna walks across the city with M.I.A. and Minaj , and is still followed by cheerleaders and football players . She walks down a city street , as players are shot down by an unseen shooter who opens fire from a passing vehicle . She climbs a pyramid of football players , and is eventually taken to a club with Minaj and M.I.A. , who sing their parts in a room filled with other cheerleaders and football players . Madonna then falls from the building but two players catch her . She makes her way to a town square , then starts dancing with her cheerleaders as they bash heads off of football players using baseball bats , revealing a climactic firework spectacle . Madonna grabs one of the heads and proudly displays it to a cheering audience . The video ends with Madonna in front of a brick wall , laughing and throwing away the baby doll , as the word " Touchdown ! " appears in front of a pink backdrop .

 Writing for Spin Caryn Ganz was pleased by the video , saying " [ Madonna 's ] attempt to find a bridge between sports , love , and fame falls a bit flat ... but in the end , the football players and cheerleaders in the video are all literally faceless passersby . They , like the two high @-@ profile MCs , are all here in service of [ the singer ] . " Becky Bain Idolator found a number of topics to discuss about the video , including trick photography , golden rains and the appearance of the singers as " triple Marilyn or triple Madonna " . Though she believed that it was not Madonna 's best video , nevertheless it was successful as a release . Christopher Farley from The Washington Post gave another positive review , saying that the singer " appears to be in better shape than many college students , which is crazy " and also complimented her for picking " M.I.A. and Nicki Minaj – and getting them to literally serve as cheerleaders for the Madonna brand . " MTV News ' Jocelyn Vena described it as " funky , fun and surreal ( and almost cartoony ) " as well as fun and light @-@ hearted : " Madonna looks like she 's having an incredibly fun time throughout the visual , smiling and shimmying her way through this fictional , hyper @-@ fantasy world . Watching the clip , one may wonder what doesn 't happen in the video . " 
 Nicole James from MTV News opined that the video gave another impression that although " Madonna 's never been the cute and innocent homecoming queen , but those wholesome , all @-@ American football players still wanna kick it with her . " Cragg from The Guardian declared the video as a " hoot " with the " creepy cheerleaders and Madonna breastfeeding a doll " . Bradley Stern from MuuMuse found similarities in the video with those of singer Björk 's video for " It 's Oh So Quiet " ( 1995 ) and Kylie Minogue 's " Come into My World " ( 2002 ) with the " walk @-@ talk and walk @-@ crawl " formula in it . He added that the video is " self @-@ aware , thoroughly modern , cheeky , sarcastic , glamorous and entirely camp all at the same time " . Chris <unk> from TheWrap noted similarities to Madonna 's own " Material Girl " ( 1985 ) video with the scenes showing her being carried off by the footballers , adding that " everything here is as dumb as the titular spelling , but the campiness has its charm , at least if you like the old musicals that some of the tracking shots here are paying homage to . " 
 A writer from Rolling Stone gave a mixed review for the video saying that " It 's a goofy and fun clip , though the faceless cheerleaders in the background are more creepy than amusing . " In a pre @-@ release screening of MDNA , Matthew Todd from Attitude believed that the last scene showing Madonna throwing off a baby doll implied that she was moving away from domestic life and embracing a party attitude . Amanda Dobbins from New York found some " attempted weirdness " in the video with the scenes of the triple Marilyns and the baby on Madonna 's lap , but added that " Madonna still looks crazy bonkers good " .

 In February 2012 , Madonna performed " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " with M.I.A. and Nicki Minaj at the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis , Indiana . Madonna collaborated with Cirque du Soleil in producing the show . 36 image projectors were utilized to create a spectacle of lights . The whole performance consisted of 500 total outfits including customized looks for musical guests LMFAO , Minaj , M.I.A. and Green as well as costumes for 100 drum line performers , 150 gladiators — who wore pairs of black underwear designed by Calvin Klein — and 200 choir singers . As the performance of " Music " ended , a group of female dancers in cheerleader uniforms joined Madonna onstage for performing " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " . Minaj and M.I.A. joined her onstage , both dressed in Egyptian inspired clothing . Together they danced as cheerleaders while holding pom @-@ poms . During the intermediate section , all three of them stood on separate elevated platforms where Minaj and M.I.A. performed their respective verses . 
 The performance gained widespread attention from the media after M.I.A. extended her middle finger to the camera near the end of her verse instead of singing the word " shit " . Media criticized M.I.A. for the gesture and compared the incident to Janet Jackson 's 2004 wardrobe malfunction . People said , " Call it a finger malfunction ? Madonna was supposed to be the center of attention during the Super Bowl halftime show Sunday , but the Queen of Pop was upstaged by her collaborator M.I.A. , who flipped off the camera at one point during the performance , prompting swift apologies from the NFL and NBC . " Madonna herself expressed her disappointment during an interview with host Ryan Seacrest on his talk show , On Air with Ryan Seacrest . She felt that it was a " teenager ... irrelevant thing " for M.I.A. to do during the show , since it was " out of place " . Brian McCarthy , spokesman for the NFL said , " Our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers . The NFL hired the talent and produced the halftime show . There was a failure in NBC 's delay system . The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate , very disappointing , and we apologize to our fans . " McCarthy also clarified that the gesture was not revealed during rehearsals , M.I.A. improvised it on stage . The league later fined the rapper a total of $ 16 @.@ 6 million as penalty , which was resolved through a confidential agreement in 2014 . 
 Madonna also performed " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " the same year on The MDNA Tour . After the performance of " Express Yourself " ended , she began performing " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " dressed as a drum majorette in a white @-@ and @-@ red uniform with tall white boots . Phillips explained that the ensemble was created and inspired by a 1940s majorette look , and she added Swarovski crystals to the dress . Madonna sang the song on stage while a drumline was suspended in mid @-@ air , and M.I.A. and Minaj appeared on the video screen . Caryn Ganz from Spin called the performance as the " night 's most innovative moment " while Brian McManus from Rolling Stone was impressed with the drumline levitation on top of the stage . <unk> Elis from The Jerusalem Post declared the performance as one of the show 's " wow " moments . The November 19 – 20 , 2012 , performance of " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " at Miami , American Airlines Arena , was recorded and released in Madonna 's fourth live album , MDNA World Tour in CD and DVD .

 = David Hudson ( pioneer ) = 
 David Hudson ( February 17 , 1761 – March 17 , 1836 ) was an American businessman noted for founding Hudson Township , the present @-@ day Hudson , Ohio . Hudson was born in Branford , Connecticut and lived there until age four , when his family moved to Goshen , Connecticut . He lived in Goshen for many years , owning a farm , marrying Anna Norton in 1783 and raising the oldest seven of their nine children there . In 1789 , Hudson joined a group to purchase a parcel of land in the Connecticut Western Reserve . The following year , he left Goshen to survey the parcel and settle it as Hudson Township . Hudson traveled through the state of New York , west along Lake Erie and south along the Cuyahoga River to reach his land . 
 At the settlement , Hudson and his men built a home and the township 's population increased steadily over the next few decades . Hudson 's wife and children eventually moved to the township , where they had two more children . Hudson cited religion as a major influence on his life . He died on March 17 , 1836 at age 75 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Hudson was born in Branford , Connecticut on February 17 , 1761 , the youngest child of David Hudson and Rebecca Fowler . Four years after his birth , his family moved to Goshen , Connecticut . 
 According to a family legend , Hudson served as a drummer boy during the American Revolutionary War ( which began in 1775 , when he was 14 ) . His service is unconfirmed , however , and his name does not appear in the Historical Register of Officers of the Continental Army . There is also doubt about Hudson 's claim that his property was " spent " at the hands of the British . Had his land been raided — which was unlikely — he should have received a share of the Firelands , a tract of land given residents of Connecticut in compensation for war damages , and Hudson would probably not have later invested in and settled land in the Connecticut Western Reserve . 
 On December 22 , 1783 , Hudson married Anna Norton , daughter of David Norton and Anna Brownson , and they raised their first seven children in Goshen until 1799 . Hudson owned a probably @-@ substantial farm there . On October 10 , 1795 , Hudson bought $ 1 @,@ 200 worth of stock of the Connecticut Land Company , owner of the Connecticut Western Reserve ( a tract of land which was to be subdivided and sold ) . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 According to Hudson , his early religious experiences shaped his later life . His father , a Presbyterian , became a Baptist when Hudson was nine . Six years later , his father became a Quaker . The elder Hudson 's frequent changes of religion made his son a skeptic ; Hudson claimed disgust with the " failings and immoralities " of " many professing Christians . " Later , however , he cited the French Revolution as his religious " awakening " . Hudson was repelled by the uprising 's violence and disregard for life ; in 1798 he proclaimed himself a " political Christian " , and later a " speculative Christian " . From then on , Hudson felt it his duty to lead a religious life . He was quiet about his beliefs , however : " My pride would not permit me to <unk> my soul to any living person . I hated company " . In his writings Hudson cited the principles of " morality , religion , law observance and education " which may have influenced his later actions , including the settlement of land in the west .

 In 1795 , the Connecticut Land Company bought land in Northeast Ohio , then known as the Connecticut Western Reserve . The parcel was divided into 129 townships , each measuring 25 square miles ( 65 km2 ) . Hudson bought a plot of land in the Reserve ( township 4 , range 10 ) in 1798 in partnership with a group including Birdsey and Nathaniel Norton , who provided three @-@ fourths of the money for the purchase . Of the group , only Hudson left for the land with a small group of settlers ( including his son Ira and employees Jesse Linsley and William McKinley ) , on April 22 , 1799 . 
 The group reached Albany , New York two days later , where Joseph Darrow was hired . Hudson also bought $ 46 @.@ 50 worth of goods in Albany and nearby Schenectady . A few members of the group , including Ira Hudson , left to drive cattle to the settlement . The others then traveled across New York along the Mohawk River valley , passing through Fort Schuyler in Utica ( where Jonah Meechum was hired on April 29 ) . The group then arrived at Onondaga ( near present @-@ day Syracuse ) on May 2 , where Richard Blin was hired . They reached East Bloomfield , where Birdsey Norton lived , on May 5 . The party replenished its supplies and Hudson met with Benjamin Tappan , who was on his way to a settlement near Hudson 's . They agreed to travel together by boat , while another small group herded livestock overland , to their respective settlements . On May 16 , 1799 , the group , consisting of Hudson , Darrow , Blin , McKinley and Tappan , traveled north to Lake Ontario . Departing in several boats from Oswego , they traveled west towards Lake Erie . 
 Although Hudson anticipated that the trip would take less than a month , it took 56 days . Most of the journey was by water , and ice on the Niagara River , inclement weather and ice on Lake Erie , and unnavigable portions of the Cuyahoga River contributed to the travelers ' slow progress . Although ice on Lake Erie and the Buffalo River near Niagara Falls destroyed one boat , the group reached Cleaveland ( present @-@ day Cleveland , Ohio ) on June 9 , 1799 . After purchasing more supplies , they set off down the Cuyahoga River . Although Hudson believed that the river could carry their boats as far south as required , they only reached present @-@ day Northfield on June 20 . When the settlers arrived in the vicinity of their parcel they had difficulty locating its four boundary markers , finding the southwest marker in late June . Only one of the two groups herding cattle overland reached the settlement . 
 = = = Hudson Township = = = 
 After establishing the center point of their parcel , Hudson and his partners built a trail from that point to their boat on the Cuyahoga . It took more than a week for the group to build the trail and carry their goods from the boat . They then built a small shelter , and began to establish the township . 
 The group experienced hardship over the next few months , including wet weather and a shortage of food . Hudson traveled back up the Cuyahoga to Cleaveland in an attempt to buy food . " The weather was exceeding wet and very cold , and I experienced the most uncomfortable night I ever felt " , he wrote in his journal . When Hudson returned to Cleaveland , he found few settlers and no food to spare . He continued east on Lake Erie to the mouth of Cattaraugus Creek , a stream in Western New York . There , Hudson obtained food and brought it back to the settlement . 
 By autumn , its population had grown to thirteen ; the group built a 16 @-@ by @-@ 18 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 9 m × 5 @.@ 5 m ) log house and planted a small turnip garden and a 9 @-@ acre ( 3 @.@ 6 ha ) wheat field . By this time most of the plot had been surveyed , and surveying was completed on October 11 . 
 The following day Hudson , his son Ira and two other men returned to Goshen , Connecticut , to sell land on the Western Reserve . Hudson 's boat was leaky and the trip was difficult due to cold , inclement weather , but in Goshen he found his family in good health . Hudson sold land on his settlement to twenty @-@ eight people , offering 40 acres ( 16 ha ) to the first purchaser ( Miss Ruth Gaylord , who gave the land to her niece ) . 
 On January 1 , 1800 Hudson and his family left Goshen for the township , their new permanent residence . The family stopped in Bloomfield , New York , where they met with the rest of the settlers . Hudson purchased livestock and a year 's worth of supplies for $ 2 @,@ 000 , giving the livestock to four men to drive overland to the settlement . On April 30 , the remaining settlers embarked on eight boats , arriving on May 20 . On October 28 , Anna Hudson gave birth to Anne Maria , the first person born in the settlement . 
 By the end of the year , Hudson 's colony was the first established settlement in present @-@ day Summit County . A few more settlers arrived in 1801 , and in 1802 the settlement became officially known as Hudson Township . 
 = = Post @-@ establishment = = 
 After establishing Hudson Township , Hudson played a significant part in the buying , selling and farming of land in his and neighboring towns . By 1808 , he owned a total of 2 @,@ 994 acres ( 12 @.@ 12 km2 ) of land in Hudson and Chester Townships . On this land Hudson grew hay , potatoes , corn and wheat , and managed hogs , oxen , cows , sheep and horses . He also provided accommodations for visitors to the town . Hudson was party to about 200 financial transactions , making him a prominent figure in the area . During this period , it was typical for employers to pay employees partially in whiskey . Hudson broke this tradition by declining to pay his workers with alcohol , to their disgruntlement . 
 Hudson 's home , built in 1805 – 06 , was the first frame house in town . Two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stories tall , it measured 40 by 30 feet ( 12 @.@ 2 m × 9 @.@ 1 m ) . In addition to housing Hudson 's family , it was the town 's first post office , tavern and courtroom . The courtroom was used for trials heard by justice of the peace Arthur St. Clair , whom Hudson appointed in 1800 in one of his first actions after founding the town . Hudson served as the township 's first postmaster , holding the office until 1829 ( when he was removed from the position after opposing Andrew Jackson in the 1828 presidential election ) . The house was also a frequent source of food and shelter for travelers due to the township 's central location in the Western Reserve . David Hudson Jr . , Hudson 's son , recorded the names of hundreds of people who passed through the house in his diaries . Hudson 's wife , Anna , gave birth to the last two of their nine children in the township . David Jr . , the youngest , was last in a line of six generations of youngest Hudson sons named David . Anna Hudson died in August 1816 . The following January , Hudson married Mari Robinson . Hudson died on March 17 , 1836 , at 75 years of age . 
 = History of numerical weather prediction = 
 The history of numerical weather prediction considers how current weather conditions as input into mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans to predict the weather and future sea state ( the process of numerical weather prediction ) has changed over the years . Though first attempted manually in the 1920s , it was not until the advent of the computer and computer simulation that computation time was reduced to less than the forecast period itself . ENIAC was used to create the first forecasts via computer in 1950 , and over the years more powerful computers have been used to increase the size of initial datasets as well as include more complicated versions of the equations of motion . The development of global forecasting models led to the first climate models . The development of limited area ( regional ) models facilitated advances in forecasting the tracks of tropical cyclone as well as air quality in the 1970s and 1980s . 
 Because the output of forecast models based on atmospheric dynamics requires corrections near ground level , model output statistics ( MOS ) were developed in the 1970s and 1980s for individual forecast points ( locations ) . The MOS apply statistical techniques to post @-@ process the output of dynamical models with the most recent surface observations and the forecast point 's climatology . This technique can correct for model resolution as well as model biases . Even with the increasing power of supercomputers , the forecast skill of numerical weather models only extends to about two weeks into the future , since the density and quality of observations — together with the chaotic nature of the partial differential equations used to calculate the forecast — introduce errors which double every five days . The use of model ensemble forecasts since the 1990s helps to define the forecast uncertainty and extend weather forecasting farther into the future than otherwise possible . 
 = = Background = = 
 Until the end of the 19th century , weather prediction was entirely subjective and based on empirical rules , with only limited understanding of the physical mechanisms behind weather processes . In 1901 Cleveland Abbe , founder of the United States Weather Bureau , proposed that the atmosphere is governed by the same principles of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics that were studied in the previous century . In 1904 , Vilhelm Bjerknes derived a two @-@ step procedure for model @-@ based weather forecasting . First , a diagnostic step is used to process data to generate initial conditions , which are then advanced in time by a prognostic step that solves the initial value problem . He also identified seven variables that defined the state of the atmosphere at a given point : pressure , temperature , density , humidity , and the three components of the flow velocity vector . Bjerknes pointed out that equations based on mass continuity , conservation of momentum , the first and second laws of thermodynamics , and the ideal gas law could be used to estimate the state of the atmosphere in the future through numerical methods . With the exception of the second law of thermodynamics , these equations form the basis of the primitive equations used in present @-@ day weather models . 
 In 1922 , Lewis Fry Richardson published the first attempt at forecasting the weather numerically . Using a hydrostatic variation of Bjerknes 's primitive equations , Richardson produced by hand a 6 @-@ hour forecast for the state of the atmosphere over two points in central Europe , taking at least six weeks to do so . His forecast calculated that the change in surface pressure would be 145 millibars ( 4 @.@ 3 inHg ) , an unrealistic value incorrect by two orders of magnitude . The large error was caused by an imbalance in the pressure and wind velocity fields used as the initial conditions in his analysis . 
 The first successful numerical prediction was performed using the ENIAC digital computer in 1950 by a team composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney , Philip Thompson , Larry Gates , and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar <unk> and applied mathematician John von Neumann . They used a simplified form of atmospheric dynamics based on solving the barotropic vorticity equation over a single layer of the atmosphere , by computing the geopotential height of the atmosphere 's 500 millibars ( 15 inHg ) pressure surface . This simplification greatly reduced demands on computer time and memory , so the computations could be performed on the relatively primitive computers of the day . When news of the first weather forecast by ENIAC was received by Richardson in 1950 , he remarked that the results were an " enormous scientific advance . " The first calculations for a 24 ‑ hour forecast took ENIAC nearly 24 hours to produce , but Charney 's group noted that most of that time was spent in " manual operations " , and expressed hope that forecasts of the weather before it occurs would soon be realized . 
 = = Early years = = 
 In September 1954 , Carl @-@ Gustav Rossby assembled an international group of meteorologists in Stockholm and produced the first operational forecast ( i.e. routine predictions for practical use ) based on the barotropic equation . Operational numerical weather prediction in the United States began in 1955 under the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit ( JNWPU ) , a joint project by the U.S. Air Force , Navy , and Weather Bureau . The JNWPU model was originally a three @-@ layer barotropic model , also developed by Charney . It only modeled the atmosphere in the Northern Hemisphere . In 1956 , the JNWPU switched to a two @-@ layer thermotropic model developed by Thompson and Gates . The main assumption made by the thermotropic model is that while the magnitude of the thermal wind may change , its direction does not change with respect to height , and thus the <unk> in the atmosphere can be simulated using the 500 mb ( 15 inHg ) and 1 @,@ 000 mb ( 30 inHg ) geopotential height surfaces and the average thermal wind between them . However , due to the low skill showed by the thermotropic model , the JNWPU reverted to the single @-@ layer barotropic model in 1958 . The Japanese Meteorological Agency became the third organization to initiate operational numerical weather prediction in 1959 . The first real @-@ time forecasts made by Australia 's Bureau of Meteorology in 1969 for portions of the Southern Hemisphere were also based on the single @-@ layer barotropic model . 
 Later models used more complete equations for atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics . In 1959 , Karl @-@ Heinz <unk> produced the first reasonable primitive equation forecast , 37 years after Richardson 's failed attempt . <unk> did so by removing small oscillations from the numerical model during initialization . In 1966 , West Germany and the United States began producing operational forecasts based on primitive @-@ equation models , followed by the United Kingdom in 1972 and Australia in 1977 . Later additions to primitive equation models allowed additional insight into different weather phenomena . In the United States , solar radiation effects were added to the primitive equation model in 1967 ; moisture effects and latent heat were added in 1968 ; and feedback effects from rain on convection were incorporated in 1971 . Three years later , the first global forecast model was introduced . Sea ice began to be initialized in forecast models in 1971 . Efforts to involve sea surface temperature in model initialization began in 1972 due to its role in modulating weather in higher latitudes of the Pacific . 
 = = Global forecast models = = 
 A global forecast model is a weather forecasting model which initializes and forecasts the weather throughout the Earth 's troposphere . It is a computer program that produces meteorological information for future times at given locations and altitudes . Within any modern model is a set of equations , known as the primitive equations , used to predict the future state of the atmosphere . These equations — along with the ideal gas law — are used to evolve the density , pressure , and potential temperature scalar fields and the flow velocity vector field of the atmosphere through time . Additional transport equations for pollutants and other aerosols are included in some primitive @-@ equation high @-@ resolution models as well . The equations used are nonlinear partial differential equations which are impossible to solve exactly through analytical methods , with the exception of a few idealized cases . Therefore , numerical methods obtain approximate solutions . Different models use different solution methods : some global models and almost all regional models use finite difference methods for all three spatial dimensions , while other global models and a few regional models use spectral methods for the horizontal dimensions and finite @-@ difference methods in the vertical . 
 The National Meteorological Center 's Global Spectral Model was introduced during August 1980 . The European Centre for Medium @-@ Range Weather Forecasts model debuted on May 1 , 1985 . The United Kingdom Met Office has been running their global model since the late 1980s , adding a 3D @-@ Var data assimilation scheme in mid @-@ 1999 . The Canadian Meteorological Centre has been running a global model since 1991 . The United States ran the Nested Grid Model ( <unk> ) from 1987 to 2000 , with some features lasting as late as 2009 . Between 2000 and 2002 , the Environmental Modeling Center ran the Aviation ( AVN ) model for shorter range forecasts and the Medium Range Forecast ( MRF ) model at longer time ranges . During this time , the AVN model was extended to the end of the forecast period , eliminating the need of the MRF and thereby replacing it . In late 2002 , the AVN model was renamed the Global Forecast System ( GFS ) . The German Weather Service has been running their global hydrostatic model , the <unk> , using a hexagonal <unk> grid since 2002 . The GFS is slated to eventually be supplanted by the Flow @-@ following , finite @-@ volume <unk> Model ( FIM ) , which like the <unk> is gridded on a truncated icosahedron , in the mid @-@ 2010s . 
 = = Global climate models = = 
 In 1956 , Norman Phillips developed a mathematical model which could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere , which became the first successful climate model . Following Phillips 's work , several groups began working to create general circulation models . The first general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory . By the early 1980s , the United States ' National Center for Atmospheric Research had developed the Community Atmosphere Model ; this model has been continuously refined into the 2000s . In 1986 , efforts began to initialize and model soil and vegetation types , which led to more realistic forecasts . For example , the Center for Ocean @-@ Land Atmosphere Studies ( <unk> ) model showed a warm temperature bias of 2 @-@ 4 ° C ( 4 @-@ 7 ° F ) and a low precipitation bias due to incorrect <unk> of crop and vegetation type across the central United States . Coupled ocean @-@ atmosphere climate models such as the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research 's <unk> model are currently being used as inputs for climate change studies . The importance of gravity waves was neglected within these models until the mid @-@ 1980s . Now , gravity waves are required within global climate models in order to properly simulate regional and global scale circulations , though their broad spectrum makes their incorporation complicated . The Climate System Model ( CSM ) was developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in January 1994 . 
 = = Limited @-@ area models = = 
 The horizontal domain of a model is either global , covering the entire Earth , or regional , covering only part of the Earth . Regional models ( also known as limited @-@ area models , or <unk> ) allow for the use of finer ( or smaller ) grid spacing than global models . The available computational resources are focused on a specific area instead of being spread over the globe . This allows regional models to resolve explicitly smaller @-@ scale meteorological phenomena that cannot be represented on the coarser grid of a global model . Regional models use a global model for initial conditions of the edge of their domain in order to allow systems from outside the regional model domain to move into its area . Uncertainty and errors within regional models are introduced by the global model used for the boundary conditions of the edge of the regional model , as well as errors attributable to the regional model itself . 
 In the United States , the first operational regional model , the limited @-@ area fine @-@ mesh ( <unk> ) model , was introduced in 1971 . Its development was halted , or frozen , in 1986 . The <unk> debuted in 1987 and was also used to create model output statistics for the United States . Its development was frozen in 1991 . The ETA model was implemented for the United States in 1993 and in turn was upgraded to the NAM in 2006 . The U.S. also offers the Rapid Refresh ( which replaced the RUC in 2012 ) for short @-@ range and high @-@ resolution applications ; both the Rapid Refresh and NAM are built on the same framework , the WRF . <unk> France has been running their Action de Recherche Petite Échelle Grande Échelle ( <unk> ) mesoscale model for France , based upon the ECMWF global model , since 1995 . In July 1996 , the Bureau of Meteorology implemented the Limited Area Prediction System ( <unk> ) . The Canadian Regional Finite @-@ Elements model ( RFE ) went into operational use on April 22 , 1986 . It was followed by the Canadian Global Environmental Multiscale Model ( GEM ) mesoscale model on February 24 , 1997 . 
 The German Weather Service developed the High Resolution Regional Model ( HRM ) in 1999 , which is widely run within the operational and research meteorological communities and run with hydrostatic assumptions . The Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System ( AMPS ) was developed for the southernmost continent in 2000 by the United States Antarctic Program . The German non @-@ hydrostatic <unk> @-@ Modell for Europe ( <unk> ) has been run since 2002 , and an increase in areal domain became operational on September 28 , 2005 . The Japanese Meteorological Agency has run a high @-@ resolution , non @-@ hydrostatic mesoscale model since September 2004 . 
 = = Air quality models = = 
 The technical literature on air pollution dispersion is quite extensive and dates back to the 1930s and earlier . One of the early air pollutant plume dispersion equations was derived by Bosanquet and Pearson . Their equation did not assume Gaussian distribution nor did it include the effect of ground reflection of the pollutant plume . Sir Graham Sutton derived an air pollutant plume dispersion equation in 1947 which did include the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the vertical and crosswind dispersion of the plume and also included the effect of ground reflection of the plume . Under the stimulus provided by the advent of stringent environmental control regulations , there was an immense growth in the use of air pollutant plume dispersion calculations between the late 1960s and today . A great many computer programs for calculating the dispersion of air pollutant emissions were developed during that period of time and they were called " air dispersion models " . The basis for most of those models was the Complete Equation For Gaussian Dispersion Modeling Of Continuous , Buoyant Air Pollution Plumes The Gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation requires the input of H which is the pollutant plume 's centerline height above ground level — and H is the sum of Hs ( the actual physical height of the pollutant plume 's emission source point ) plus ΔH ( the plume rise due the plume 's buoyancy ) . 
 To determine ΔH , many if not most of the air dispersion models developed between the late 1960s and the early 2000s used what are known as " the Briggs equations . " G. A. Briggs first published his plume rise observations and comparisons in 1965 . In 1968 , at a symposium sponsored by Conservation of Clean Air and Water in Europe , he compared many of the plume rise models then available in the literature . In that same year , Briggs also wrote the section of the publication edited by Slade dealing with the comparative analyses of plume rise models . That was followed in 1969 by his classical critical review of the entire plume rise literature , in which he proposed a set of plume rise equations which have become widely known as " the Briggs equations " . Subsequently , Briggs modified his 1969 plume rise equations in 1971 and in 1972 . 
 The Urban <unk> Model , a regional forecast model for the effects of air pollution and acid rain , was developed by a private company in the USA in 1970 . Development of this model was taken over by the Environmental Protection Agency and improved in the mid to late 1970s using results from a regional air pollution study . While developed in California , this model was later used in other areas of North America , Europe and Asia during the 1980s . The Community Multiscale Air Quality model ( <unk> ) is an open source air quality model run within the United States in conjunction with the NAM mesoscale model since 2004 . The first operational air quality model in Canada , Canadian Hemispheric and Regional Ozone and NOx System ( <unk> ) , began to be run in 2001 . It was replaced with the Global Environmental Multiscale model - Modelling Air quality and Chemistry ( GEM @-@ <unk> ) model in November 2009 . 
 = = Tropical cyclone models = = 
 During 1972 , the first model to forecast storm surge along the continental shelf was developed , known as the Special Program to List the Amplitude of Surges from Hurricanes ( SPLASH ) . In 1978 , the first hurricane @-@ tracking model based on atmospheric dynamics – the movable fine @-@ mesh ( MFM ) model – began operating . Within the field of tropical cyclone track forecasting , despite the ever @-@ improving dynamical model guidance which occurred with increased computational power , it was not until the decade of the 1980s when numerical weather prediction showed skill , and until the 1990s when it consistently outperformed statistical or simple dynamical models . In the early 1980s , the assimilation of satellite @-@ derived winds from water vapor , infrared , and visible satellite imagery was found to improve tropical cyclones track forecasting . The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory ( GFDL ) hurricane model was used for research purposes between 1973 and the mid @-@ 1980s . Once it was determined that it could show skill in hurricane prediction , a multi @-@ year transition transformed the research model into an operational model which could be used by the National Weather Service in 1995 . 
 The Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting ( HWRF ) model is a specialized version of the Weather Research and Forecasting ( WRF ) model and is used to forecast the track and intensity of tropical cyclones . The model was developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory , the University of Rhode Island , and Florida State University . It became operational in 2007 . Despite improvements in track forecasting , predictions of the intensity of a tropical cyclone based on numerical weather prediction continue to be a challenge , since <unk> methods continue to show higher skill over dynamical guidance . 
 = = Ocean models = = 
 The first ocean wave models were developed in the 1960s and 1970s . These models had the tendency to overestimate the role of wind in wave development and underplayed wave interactions . A lack of knowledge concerning how waves interacted among each other , assumptions regarding a maximum wave height , and deficiencies in computer power limited the performance of the models . After experiments were performed in 1968 , 1969 , and 1973 , wind input from the Earth 's atmosphere was weighted more accurately in the predictions . A second generation of models was developed in the 1980s , but they could not realistically model swell nor depict wind @-@ driven waves ( also known as wind waves ) caused by rapidly changing wind fields , such as those within tropical cyclones . This caused the development of a third generation of wave models from 1988 onward . 
 Within this third generation of models , the spectral wave transport equation is used to describe the change in wave spectrum over changing topography . It simulates wave generation , wave movement ( propagation within a fluid ) , wave shoaling , refraction , energy transfer between waves , and wave dissipation . Since surface winds are the primary forcing mechanism in the spectral wave transport equation , ocean wave models use information produced by numerical weather prediction models as inputs to determine how much energy is transferred from the atmosphere into the layer at the surface of the ocean . Along with dissipation of energy through <unk> and resonance between waves , surface winds from numerical weather models allow for more accurate predictions of the state of the sea surface . 
 = = Model output statistics = = 
 Because forecast models based upon the equations for atmospheric dynamics do not perfectly determine weather conditions near the ground , statistical corrections were developed to attempt to resolve this problem . Statistical models were created based upon the three @-@ dimensional fields produced by numerical weather models , surface observations , and the climatological conditions for specific locations . These statistical models are collectively referred to as model output statistics ( MOS ) , and were developed by the National Weather Service for their suite of weather forecasting models by 1976 . The United States Air Force developed its own set of MOS based upon their dynamical weather model by 1983 . 
 = = Ensembles = = 
 As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963 , it is impossible for long @-@ range forecasts — those made more than two weeks in advance — to predict the state of the atmosphere with any degree of skill , owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved . Extremely small errors in temperature , winds , or other initial inputs given to numerical models will amplify and double every five days . Furthermore , existing observation networks have limited spatial and temporal resolution ( for example , over large bodies of water such as the Pacific Ocean ) , which introduces uncertainty into the true initial state of the atmosphere . While a set of equations , known as the Liouville equations , exists to determine the initial uncertainty in the model initialization , the equations are too complex to run in real @-@ time , even with the use of supercomputers . These uncertainties limit forecast model accuracy to about six days into the future . 
 Edward Epstein recognized in 1969 that the atmosphere could not be completely described with a single forecast run due to inherent uncertainty , and proposed a stochastic dynamic model that produced means and variances for the state of the atmosphere . While these Monte Carlo simulations showed skill , in 1974 Cecil Leith revealed that they produced adequate forecasts only when the ensemble probability distribution was a representative sample of the probability distribution in the atmosphere . It was not until 1992 that ensemble forecasts began being prepared by the European Centre for Medium @-@ Range Weather Forecasts , the Canadian Meteorological Centre , and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction . The ECMWF model , the Ensemble Prediction System , uses singular vectors to simulate the initial probability density , while the NCEP ensemble , the Global Ensemble Forecasting System , uses a technique known as vector breeding . 
 = Mary Wollstonecraft = 
 Mary Wollstonecraft ( / <unk> / ; 27 April 1759 – 10 September 1797 ) was an English writer , philosopher , and advocate of women 's rights . During her brief career , she wrote novels , treatises , a travel narrative , a history of the French Revolution , a conduct book , and a children 's book . Wollstonecraft is best known for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman ( 1792 ) , in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men , but appear to be only because they lack education . She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason . 
 Until the late 20th century , Wollstonecraft 's life , which encompassed several unconventional personal relationships , received more attention than her writing . After two ill @-@ fated affairs , with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay ( by whom she had a daughter , Fanny Imlay ) , Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin , one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement . Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 , eleven days after giving birth to her second daughter , leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts . This daughter , Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin , became an accomplished writer herself , as Mary Shelley , the author of Frankenstein . 
 After Wollstonecraft 's death , her widower published a Memoir ( 1798 ) of her life , revealing her unorthodox lifestyle , which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for almost a century . However , with the emergence of the feminist movement at the turn of the twentieth century , Wollstonecraft 's advocacy of women 's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important . Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers , and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Wollstonecraft was born on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields , London . She was the second of the seven children of Edward John Wollstonecraft and Elizabeth Dixon . Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child , her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects . Consequently , the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft 's youth . The family 's financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft 's father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity . Moreover , he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages . As a teenager , Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mother 's bedroom to protect her . Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters , Everina and Eliza , throughout her life . For example , in a defining moment in 1784 , she convinced Eliza , who was suffering from what was probably postpartum depression , to leave her husband and infant ; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee , demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms . The human costs , however , were severe : her sister suffered social condemnation and , because she could not remarry , was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work . 
 Two friendships shaped Wollstonecraft 's early life . The first was with Jane Arden in Beverley . The two frequently read books together and attended lectures presented by Arden 's father , a self @-@ styled philosopher and scientist . Wollstonecraft revelled in the intellectual atmosphere of the Arden household and valued her friendship with Arden greatly , sometimes to the point of being emotionally possessive . Wollstonecraft wrote to her : " I have formed romantic notions of friendship ... I am a little singular in my thoughts of love and friendship ; I must have the first place or none . " In some of Wollstonecraft 's letters to Arden , she reveals the volatile and depressive emotions that would haunt her throughout her life . 
 The second and more important friendship was with Fanny ( Frances ) Blood , introduced to Wollstonecraft by the Clares , a couple in Hoxton who became parental figures to her ; Wollstonecraft credited Blood with opening her mind . Unhappy with her home life , Wollstonecraft struck out on her own in 1778 and accepted a job as a lady 's companion to Sarah Dawson , a widow living in Bath . However , Wollstonecraft had trouble getting along with the irascible woman ( an experience she drew on when describing the drawbacks of such a position in Thoughts on the Education of Daughters , 1787 ) . In 1780 she returned home , called back to care for her dying mother . Rather than return to Dawson 's employ after the death of her mother , Wollstonecraft moved in with the Bloods . She realized during the two years she spent with the family that she had idealized Blood , who was more invested in traditional feminine values than was Wollstonecraft . But Wollstonecraft remained dedicated to her and her family throughout her life ( she frequently gave pecuniary assistance to Blood 's brother , for example ) . 
 Wollstonecraft had envisioned living in a female utopia with Blood ; they made plans to rent rooms together and support each other emotionally and financially , but this dream collapsed under economic realities . In order to make a living , Wollstonecraft , her sisters , and Blood set up a school together in Newington Green , a Dissenting community . Blood soon became engaged and after their marriage her husband , Hugh <unk> , took her to Lisbon , Portugal , to improve her health , which had always been precarious . Despite the change of surroundings Blood 's health further deteriorated when she became pregnant , and in 1785 Wollstonecraft left the school and followed Blood to nurse her , but to no avail . Moreover , her abandonment of the school led to its failure . Blood 's death devastated Wollstonecraft and was part of the inspiration for her first novel , Mary : A Fiction ( 1788 ) . 
 = = = " The first of a new genus " = = = 
 After Blood 's death , Wollstonecraft 's friends helped her obtain a position as governess to the daughters of the Anglo @-@ Irish Kingsborough family in Ireland . Although she could not get along with Lady Kingsborough , the children found her an inspiring instructor ; Margaret King would later say she " had freed her mind from all superstitions " . Some of Wollstonecraft 's experiences during this year would make their way into her only children 's book , Original Stories from Real Life ( 1788 ) . 
 Frustrated by the limited career options open to respectable yet poor women — an impediment which Wollstonecraft eloquently describes in the chapter of Thoughts on the Education of Daughters entitled " Unfortunate Situation of Females , Fashionably Educated , and Left Without a Fortune " — she decided , after only a year as a governess , to embark upon a career as an author . This was a radical choice , since , at the time , few women could support themselves by writing . As she wrote to her sister Everina in 1787 , she was trying to become " the first of a new genus " . She moved to London and , assisted by the liberal publisher Joseph Johnson , found a place to live and work to support herself . She learned French and German and translated texts , most notably Of the Importance of Religious Opinions by Jacques Necker and Elements of Morality , for the Use of Children by Christian Gotthilf Salzmann . She also wrote reviews , primarily of novels , for Johnson 's periodical , the Analytical Review . Wollstonecraft 's intellectual universe expanded during this time , not only from the reading that she did for her reviews but also from the company she kept : she attended Johnson 's famous dinners and met such luminaries as the radical pamphleteer Thomas Paine and the philosopher William Godwin . The first time Godwin and Wollstonecraft met , they were both disappointed in each other . Godwin had come to hear Paine , but Wollstonecraft assailed him all night long , disagreeing with him on nearly every subject . Johnson himself , however , became much more than a friend ; she described him in her letters as a father and a brother . 
 While in London , Wollstonecraft pursued a relationship with the artist Henry Fuseli , even though he was already married . She was , she wrote , enraptured by his genius , " the grandeur of his soul , that quickness of comprehension , and lovely sympathy " . She proposed a platonic living arrangement with Fuseli and his wife , but Fuseli 's wife was appalled , and he broke off the relationship with Wollstonecraft . After Fuseli 's rejection , Wollstonecraft decided to travel to France to escape the humiliation of the incident , and to participate in the revolutionary events that she had just celebrated in her recent Vindication of the Rights of Men ( 1790 ) . She had written the Rights of Men in response to Edmund Burke 's conservative critique of the French Revolution in Reflections on the Revolution in France ( 1790 ) and it made her famous overnight . She was compared with such leading lights as the theologian and controversialist Joseph Priestley and Paine , whose Rights of Man ( 1791 ) would prove to be the most popular of the responses to Burke . She pursued the ideas she had outlined in Rights of Men in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman ( 1792 ) , her most famous and influential work . 
 = = = France and Gilbert Imlay = = = 
 Wollstonecraft left for Paris in December 1792 and arrived about a month before Louis XVI was guillotined . France was in turmoil . She sought out other British visitors such as Helen Maria Williams and joined the circle of expatriates then in the city . Having just written the Rights of Woman , Wollstonecraft was determined to put her ideas to the test , and in the stimulating intellectual atmosphere of the French revolution she attempted her most experimental romantic attachment yet : she met and fell passionately in love with Gilbert Imlay , an American adventurer . Whether or not she was interested in marriage , he was not , and she appears to have fallen in love with an idealized portrait of the man . While Wollstonecraft had rejected the sexual component of relationships in the Rights of Woman , Imlay awakened her passions and her interest in sex . She soon became pregnant , and on 14 May 1794 she gave birth to her first child , Fanny , naming her after perhaps her closest friend . Wollstonecraft was overjoyed ; she wrote to a friend : " My little Girl begins to suck so <unk> that her father reckons saucily on her writing the second part of the R [ <unk> ] ts of Woman " ( emphasis hers ) . She continued to write avidly , despite not only her pregnancy and the burdens of being a new mother alone in a foreign country , but also the growing tumult of the French Revolution . While at Le Havre in northern France , she wrote a history of the early revolution , An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution , which was published in London in December 1794 . 
 As the political situation worsened , Britain declared war on France , placing all British subjects in France in considerable danger . To protect Wollstonecraft , Imlay registered her as his wife in 1793 , even though they were not married . Some of her friends were not so lucky ; many , like Thomas Paine , were arrested , and some were even guillotined . ( Wollstonecraft 's sisters believed she had been imprisoned . ) After she left France , she continued to refer to herself as " Mrs Imlay " , even to her sisters , in order to bestow legitimacy upon her child . 
 Imlay , unhappy with the domestic @-@ minded and maternal Wollstonecraft , eventually left her . He promised that he would return to Le Havre where she went to give birth to her child , but his delays in writing to her and his long absences convinced Wollstonecraft that he had found another woman . Her letters to him are full of needy expostulations , explained by most critics as the expressions of a deeply depressed woman but by some as a result of her circumstances — alone with an infant in the middle of a revolution .

 Seeking Imlay , Wollstonecraft returned to London in April 1795 , but he rejected her . In May 1795 she attempted to commit suicide , probably with laudanum , but Imlay saved her life ( although it is unclear how ) . In a last attempt to win back Imlay , she embarked upon some business negotiations for him in Scandinavia , trying to recoup some of his losses . Wollstonecraft undertook this hazardous trip with only her young daughter and a maid . She recounted her travels and thoughts in letters to Imlay , many of which were eventually published as Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden , Norway , and Denmark in 1796 . When she returned to England and came to the full realisation that her relationship with Imlay was over , she attempted suicide for the second time , leaving a note for Imlay : 
 Let my wrongs sleep with me ! Soon , very soon , I shall be at peace . When you receive this , my burning head will be cold ... I shall plunge into the Thames where there is least chance of my being snatched from the death I seek . God bless you ! May you never know by experience what you have made me endure . Should your sensibility ever awake , remorse will find its way to your heart ; and , in the midst of business and sensual pleasure , I shall appear before you , the victim of your deviation from rectitude . 
 She then went out on a rainy night and " to make her clothes heavy with water , she walked up and down about half an hour " before jumping into the River Thames , but a stranger saw her jump and rescued her . Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational , writing after her rescue , 
 I have only to lament , that , when the bitterness of death was past , I was <unk> brought back to life and misery . But a fixed determination is not to be baffled by disappointment ; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt , which was one of the calmest acts of reason . In this respect , I am only accountable to myself . Did I care for what is termed reputation , it is by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured . 
 Gradually , Wollstonecraft returned to her literary life , becoming involved with Joseph Johnson 's circle again , in particular with Mary Hays , Elizabeth <unk> , and Sarah Siddons through William Godwin . Godwin and Wollstonecraft 's unique courtship began slowly , but it eventually became a passionate love affair . Godwin had read her Letters Written in Sweden , Norway , and Denmark and later wrote that " If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author , this appears to me to be the book . She speaks of her sorrows , in a way that fills us with melancholy , and dissolves us in tenderness , at the same time that she displays a genius which commands all our admiration . " Once Wollstonecraft became pregnant , they decided to marry so that their child would be legitimate . Their marriage revealed the fact that Wollstonecraft had never been married to Imlay , and as a result she and Godwin lost many friends . Godwin received further criticism because he had advocated the abolition of marriage in his philosophical treatise Political Justice . After their marriage on 29 March 1797 , they moved into two adjoining houses , known as The Polygon , so that they could both still retain their independence ; they often communicated by letter . By all accounts , theirs was a happy and stable , though brief , relationship . 
 = = = Death and Godwin 's Memoirs = = = 
 On 30 August 1797 , Wollstonecraft gave birth to her second daughter , Mary . Although the delivery seemed to go well initially , the placenta broke apart during the birth and became infected ; puerperal ( <unk> ) fever was a common and often fatal occurrence in the eighteenth century . After several days of agony , Wollstonecraft died of septicaemia on 10 September . Godwin was devastated : he wrote to his friend Thomas Holcroft , " I firmly believe there does not exist her equal in the world . I know from experience we were formed to make each other happy . I have not the least expectation that I can now ever know happiness again . " She was buried at Old Saint Pancras Churchyard , where her tombstone reads , " Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin , Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman : Born 27 April 1759 : Died 10 September 1797 . " ( In 1851 , her remains were moved by her grandson Percy Florence Shelley to his family tomb in St Peter 's Church , Bournemouth . ) Her monument in the churchyard lies to the north @-@ east of the church just north of Sir John Soane 's grave . Her husband was buried with her on his death in 1836 , as was his second wife , Mary Jane Godwin ( 1766 – 1841 ) . 
 In January 1798 Godwin published his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman . Although Godwin felt that he was portraying his wife with love , compassion , and sincerity , many readers were shocked that he would reveal Wollstonecraft 's illegitimate children , love affairs , and suicide attempts . The Romantic poet Robert Southey accused him of " the want of all feeling in stripping his dead wife naked " and vicious satires such as The <unk> 'd Females were published . Godwin 's Memoirs portrays Wollstonecraft as a woman deeply invested in feeling who was balanced by his reason and as more of a religious sceptic than her own writings suggest . Godwin 's views of Wollstonecraft were perpetuated throughout the nineteenth century and resulted in poems such as " Wollstonecraft and Fuseli " by British poet Robert Browning and that by William Roscoe which includes the lines : 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Wollstonecraft has what scholar Cora Kaplan labelled in 2002 a " curious " legacy that has evolved over time : " for an author @-@ activist adept in many genres ... up until the last quarter @-@ century Wollstonecraft 's life has been read much more closely than her writing " . After the devastating effect of Godwin 's Memoirs , Wollstonecraft 's reputation lay in tatters for a century ; she was pilloried by such writers as Maria Edgeworth , who patterned the " freakish " Harriet Freke in Belinda ( 1801 ) after her . Other novelists such as Mary Hays , Charlotte Turner Smith , Fanny Burney , and Jane West created similar figures , all to teach a " moral lesson " to their readers . ( Hays had been a close friend , and helped nurse her in her dying days . ) Scholar Virginia Sapiro states that few read Wollstonecraft 's works during the nineteenth century as " her attackers implied or stated that no self @-@ respecting woman would read her work " . ( In fact , as <unk> points out , new editions of Rights of Woman appeared in the UK in the 1840s , and in the US in the 1830s , 1840s , and 1850s . ) One of those few was Elizabeth Barrett Browning , who read Rights of Woman at the age of 12 , and whose poem Aurora Leigh reflected " Wollstonecraft 's unwavering focus on education " . Lucretia Mott , a Quaker minister , and Elizabeth Cady Stanton , Americans who met at the World Anti @-@ Slavery Convention in London , discovered they had both read Wollstonecraft , and agreed the need for what became the Seneca Falls Convention , an influential women 's rights meeting held in 1848 . Another who read Wollstonecraft was George Eliot , a prolific writer of reviews , articles , novels , and translations . In 1855 , she devoted an essay to the roles and rights of women , comparing Wollstonecraft and Margaret Fuller . Fuller was an American journalist , critic , and women 's right activist who , like Wollstonecraft , had travelled to the Continent , been involved in the struggle for reform ( in this case the Roman Republic ) , and had a child by a man without marrying him . Wollstonecraft 's children 's work was adapted by Charlotte Mary Yonge in 1870 . 
 With the rise of the movement to give women a political voice , Wollstonecraft 's work was exhumed . The first full @-@ length biography , by Elizabeth Robins Pennell , appeared in 1884 as part of a series by the Roberts Brothers on famous women . This followed an attempt at rehabilitation in 1879 , with the publication of Wollstonecraft 's Letters to Imlay , with prefatory memoir by C. Kegan Paul . Millicent Garrett Fawcett , a suffragist and later president of the National Union of Women 's Suffrage Societies , wrote the introduction to the centenary edition ( i.e. 1892 ) of the Rights of Woman , cleansing the memory of Wollstonecraft and claiming her as the <unk> of the struggle for the vote . As early as 1898 , Wollstonecraft was the subject of a doctoral thesis and its resulting book . 
 With the advent of the modern feminist movement , women as politically dissimilar from each other as Virginia Woolf and Emma Goldman embraced Wollstonecraft 's life story . By 1929 Woolf described Wollstonecraft — her writing , arguments , and " experiments in living " — as immortal : " she is alive and active , she argues and experiments , we hear her voice and trace her influence even now among the living " . Others , however , continued to decry Wollstonecraft 's lifestyle . A biography published in 1932 refers to recent reprints of her works , incorporating new research , and to a " study " in 1911 , a play in 1922 , and another biography in 1924 . Interest in her never completely died , with full @-@ length biographies in 1937 and 1951 
 With the emergence of feminist criticism in academia in the 1960s and 1970s , Wollstonecraft 's works returned to prominence . Their fortunes reflected that of the second wave of the North American feminist movement itself ; for example , in the early 1970s , six major biographies of Wollstonecraft were published that presented her " passionate life in apposition to [ her ] radical and rationalist agenda " . The feminist artwork The Dinner Party , first exhibited in 1979 , features a place setting for Wollstonecraft . In the 1980s and 1990s , yet another image of Wollstonecraft emerged , one which described her as much more a creature of her time ; scholars such as Claudia Johnson , Gary Kelly , and Virginia Sapiro demonstrated the continuity between Wollstonecraft 's thought and other important eighteenth @-@ century ideas regarding topics such as sensibility , economics , and political theory . 
 Wollstonecraft 's work has also had an effect on feminism outside the academy in recent years . Ayaan Hirsi Ali , a political writer and former Muslim who is critical of Islam in general and its dictates regarding women in particular , cited the Rights of Woman in her autobiography Infidel and wrote that she was " inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft , the pioneering feminist thinker who told women they had the same ability to reason as men did and deserved the same rights " . British writer Caitlin Moran , author of the best @-@ selling How to Be a Woman , described herself as " half Wollstonecraft " to the New Yorker . She has also inspired more widely . Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen , the Indian economist and philosopher who first identified the missing women of Asia , draws repeatedly on Wollstonecraft as a political philosopher in The Idea of Justice . 
 = = Major works = = 
 = = = Educational works = = = 
 The majority of Wollstonecraft 's early productions are about education ; she assembled an anthology of literary extracts " for the improvement of young women " entitled The Female Reader and she translated two children 's works , Maria Geertruida van de <unk> de Cambon 's Young Grandison and Christian Gotthilf Salzmann 's Elements of Morality . Her own writings also addressed the topic . In both her conduct book Thoughts on the Education of Daughters ( 1787 ) and her children 's book Original Stories from Real Life ( 1788 ) , Wollstonecraft advocates educating children into the emerging middle @-@ class ethos : self @-@ discipline , honesty , frugality , and social contentment . Both books also emphasise the importance of teaching children to reason , revealing Wollstonecraft 's intellectual debt to the important seventeenth @-@ century educational philosopher John Locke . However , the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his and links it to the discourse of sensibility popular at the end of the eighteenth century . Both texts also advocate the education of women , a controversial topic at the time and one which she would return to throughout her career , most notably in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman . Wollstonecraft argues that well @-@ educated women will be good wives and mothers and ultimately contribute positively to the nation .

 = = = = Vindication of the Rights of Men ( 1790 ) = = = = 
 Published in response to Edmund Burke 's Reflections on the Revolution in France ( 1790 ) , which was a defence of constitutional monarchy , aristocracy , and the Church of England , and an attack on Wollstonecraft 's friend , the Rev Richard Price at the Newington Green Unitarian Church , Wollstonecraft 's A Vindication of the Rights of Men ( 1790 ) attacks aristocracy and advocates republicanism . Hers was the first response in a pamphlet war that subsequently became known as the Revolution Controversy , in which Thomas Paine 's Rights of Man ( 1792 ) became the rallying cry for reformers and radicals . 
 Wollstonecraft attacked not only monarchy and hereditary privilege but also the language that Burke used to defend and elevate it . In a famous passage in the Reflections , Burke had lamented : " I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her [ Marie Antoinette ] with insult . — But the age of chivalry is gone . " Most of Burke 's detractors deplored what they viewed as theatrical pity for the French queen — a pity they felt was at the expense of the people . Wollstonecraft was unique in her attack on Burke 's gendered language . By redefining the sublime and the beautiful , terms first established by Burke himself in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful ( 1756 ) , she undermined his rhetoric as well as his argument . Burke had associated the beautiful with weakness and femininity and the sublime with strength and masculinity ; Wollstonecraft turns these definitions against him , arguing that his theatrical tableaux turn Burke 's readers — the citizens — into weak women who are swayed by show . In her first unabashedly feminist critique , which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia L. Johnson argues remains unsurpassed in its argumentative force , Wollstonecraft indicts Burke 's defence of an unequal society founded on the passivity of women . 
 In her arguments for republican virtue , Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle @-@ class ethos in opposition to what she views as the vice @-@ ridden aristocratic code of manners . Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers , she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom . She argues for rationality , pointing out that Burke 's system would lead to the continuation of slavery , simply because it had been an ancestral tradition . She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs . Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society , drawn with what she says is genuine feeling , to Burke 's false feeling . 
 The Rights of Men was Wollstonecraft 's first overtly political work , as well as her first feminist work ; as Johnson contends , " it seems that in the act of writing the later portions of Rights of Men she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her for the rest of her career " . It was this text that made her a well @-@ known writer . 
 = = = = Vindication of the Rights of Woman ( 1792 ) = = = = 
 A Vindication of the Rights of Woman is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy . In it , Wollstonecraft argues that women ought to have an education commensurate with their position in society and then proceeds to redefine that position , claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be " companions " to their husbands rather than mere wives . Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage , Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men . Large sections of the Rights of Woman respond <unk> to conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and educational philosophers such as Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau , who wanted to deny women an education . ( Rousseau famously argues in Émile ( 1762 ) that women should be educated for the pleasure of men . ) 
 Wollstonecraft states that currently many women are silly and superficial ( she refers to them , for example , as " spaniels " and " toys " ) , but argues that this is not because of an innate deficiency of mind but rather because men have denied them access to education . Wollstonecraft is intent on illustrating the limitations that women 's deficient educations have placed on them ; she writes : " Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman 's sceptre , the mind shapes itself to the body , and , roaming round its gilt cage , only seeks to adorn its prison . " She implies that , without the encouragement young women receive from an early age to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments , women could achieve much more . 
 While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life , such as morality , she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal . What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God . However , such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour . Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes : " Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things ; I have already granted , that , from the constitution of their bodies , men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue . I speak collectively of the whole sex ; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature . In fact , how can they , if virtue has only one eternal standard ? I must therefore , if I reason consequently , as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction , as that there is a God . " Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist , particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her . 
 One of Wollstonecraft 's most scathing critiques in the Rights of Woman is of false and excessive sensibility , particularly in women . She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are " blown about by every momentary gust of feeling " and because they are " the prey of their senses " they cannot think rationally . In fact , she claims , they do harm not only to themselves but to the entire civilization : these are not women who can help refine a civilization — a popular eighteenth @-@ century idea — but women who will destroy it . Wollstonecraft does not argue that reason and feeling should act independently of each other ; rather , she believes that they should inform each other . 
 In addition to her larger philosophical arguments , Wollstonecraft also lays out a specific educational plan . In the twelfth chapter of the Rights of Woman , " On National Education " , she argues that all children should be sent to a " country day school " as well as given some education at home " to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures . " She also maintains that schooling should be co @-@ educational , arguing that men and women , whose marriages are " the cement of society " , should be " educated after the same model . " 
 Wollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle @-@ class , which she describes as the " most natural state " , and in many ways the Rights of Woman is inflected by a bourgeois view of the world . It encourages modesty and industry in its readers and attacks the uselessness of the aristocracy . But Wollstonecraft is not necessarily a friend to the poor ; for example , in her national plan for education , she suggests that , after the age of nine , the poor , except for those who are brilliant , should be separated from the rich and taught in another school . 
 = = = Novels = = = 
 Both of Wollstonecraft 's novels criticize what she viewed as the patriarchal institution of marriage and its deleterious effects on women . In her first novel , Mary : A Fiction ( 1788 ) , the eponymous heroine is forced into a loveless marriage for economic reasons ; she fulfils her desire for love and affection outside of marriage with two passionate romantic friendships , one with a woman and one with a man . Maria : or , The Wrongs of Woman ( 1798 ) , an unfinished novel published posthumously and often considered Wollstonecraft 's most radical feminist work , revolves around the story of a woman imprisoned in an insane asylum by her husband ; like Mary , Maria also finds fulfilment outside of marriage , in an affair with a fellow inmate and a friendship with one of her keepers . Neither of Wollstonecraft 's novels depict successful marriages , although she posits such relationships in the Rights of Woman . At the end of Mary , the heroine believes she is going " to that world where there is neither marrying , nor giving in marriage " , presumably a positive state of affairs . 
 Both of Wollstonecraft 's novels also critique the discourse of sensibility , a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular at the end of the eighteenth century . Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself , a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely <unk> on their emotions . In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine 's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental . 
 Female friendships are central to both of Wollstonecraft 's novels , but it is the friendship between Maria and Jemima , the servant charged with watching over her in the insane asylum , that is the most historically significant . This friendship , based on a sympathetic bond of motherhood , between an upper @-@ class woman and a lower @-@ class woman is one of the first moments in the history of feminist literature that hints at a cross @-@ class argument , that is , that women of different economic positions have the same interests because they are women . 
 = = = Letters Written in Sweden , Norway , and Denmark ( 1796 ) = = = 
 Wollstonecraft 's Letters Written in Sweden , Norway , and Denmark is a deeply personal travel narrative . The twenty @-@ five letters cover a wide range of topics , from sociological reflections on Scandinavia and its peoples to philosophical questions regarding identity to musings on her relationship with Imlay ( although he is not referred to by name in the text ) . Using the rhetoric of the sublime , Wollstonecraft explores the relationship between the self and society . Reflecting the strong influence of Rousseau , Letters Written in Sweden , Norway , and Denmark shares the themes of the French philosopher 's Reveries of a Solitary Walker ( 1782 ) : " the search for the source of human happiness , the stoic rejection of material goods , the ecstatic embrace of nature , and the essential role of sentiment in understanding " . While Rousseau ultimately rejects society , however , Wollstonecraft celebrates domestic scenes and industrial progress in her text . 
 Wollstonecraft promotes subjective experience , particularly in relation to nature , exploring the connections between the sublime and sensibility . Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecraft 's desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world . In so doing , she gives greater value to the imagination than she had in previous works . As in her previous writings , she champions the liberation and education of women . In a change from her earlier works , however , she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society , contrasting the imaginative connection to the world with a commercial and mercenary one , an attitude she associates with Imlay . 
 Letters Written in Sweden , Norway , and Denmark was Wollstonecraft 's most popular book in the 1790s . It sold well and was reviewed positively by most critics . Godwin wrote " if ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author , this appears to me to be the book . " It influenced Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge , who drew on its themes and its aesthetic .
