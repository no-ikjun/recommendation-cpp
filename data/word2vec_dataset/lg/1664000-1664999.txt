 Both groups have a shell consisting of two valves , but the organization of the shell is quite different in the two groups . In brachiopods , the two valves are positioned on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body , while in bivalves , the valves are on the left and right sides of the body , and are , in most cases , mirror images of one other . Brachiopods have a lophophore , a coiled , rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding , a feature shared with two other major groups of marine invertebrates , the bryozoans and the phoronids . Brachiopod shells are often made of calcium phosphate as well as calcium carbonate , whereas bivalve shells are composed entirely of calcium carbonate . 
 = = Evolutionary history = = 
 The Cambrian explosion took place around 540 to 520 million years ago ( Mya ) . In this geologically brief period , all the major animal phyla diverged and these included the first creatures with mineralized skeletons . Brachiopods and bivalves made their appearance at this time , and left their fossilized remains behind in the rocks . 
 Possible early bivalves include Pojetaia and <unk> ; these probably lie in the stem rather than crown group . Only five genera of supposed Cambrian " bivalves " exist , the others being <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and potentially <unk> . Bivalves have also been proposed to have evolved from the <unk> . 
 Bivalve fossils are formed when the sediment in which the shells are buried hardens into rock . Often , the impression made by the valves remains as the fossil rather than the valves . During the Early Ordovician , a great increase in the diversity of bivalve species occurred , and the <unk> , heterodont , and <unk> dentitions evolved . By the early Silurian , the gills were becoming adapted for filter feeding , and during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods , siphons first appeared , which , with the newly developed muscular foot , allowed the animals to bury themselves deep in the sediment . 
 By the middle of the Paleozoic , around 400 Mya , the brachiopods were among the most abundant filter feeders in the ocean , and over 12 @,@ 000 fossil species are recognized . By the Permian – Triassic extinction event 250 Mya , bivalves were undergoing a huge radiation of diversity . The bivalves were hard hit by this event , but re @-@ established themselves and thrived during the Triassic period that followed . In contrast , the brachiopods lost 95 % of their species diversity . The ability of some bivalves to burrow and thus avoid predators may have been a major factor in their success . Other new adaptations within various families allowed species to occupy previously unused evolutionary niches . These included increasing relative buoyancy in soft sediments by developing spines on the shell , gaining the ability to swim , and in a few cases , adopting predatory habits . 
 For a long time , bivalves were thought to be better adapted to aquatic life than brachiopods were , outcompeting and relegating them to minor niches in later ages . These two taxa appeared in textbooks as an example of replacement by competition . Evidence given for this included the fact that bivalves needed less food to subsist because of their energetically efficient ligament @-@ muscle system for opening and closing valves . All this has been broadly disproven , though ; rather , the prominence of modern bivalves over brachiopods seems due to chance disparities in their response to extinction events . 
 = = Diversity of extant bivalves = = 
 The adult maximum size of living species of bivalve ranges from 0 @.@ 52 mm ( 0 @.@ 02 in ) in <unk> maya , a nut clam , to a length of 1 @,@ 532 millimetres ( 60 @.@ 3 in ) in <unk> <unk> , an elongated , burrowing shipworm . However , the species generally regarded as the largest living bivalve is the giant clam Tridacna gigas , which can grow to a length of 1 @,@ 200 mm ( 47 in ) and a weight of more than 200 kg ( 441 lb ) . The largest known extinct bivalve is a species of <unk> whose fossils measure up to 3 @,@ 000 mm ( 118 in ) in length . 
 In his 2010 treatise , Compendium of Bivalves , Markus Huber gives the total number of living bivalve species as about 9 @,@ 200 combined in 106 families . Huber states that the number of 20 @,@ 000 living species , often encountered in literature , could not be verified and presents the following table to illustrate the known diversity : 
 = = Distribution = = 
 The bivalves are a highly successful class of invertebrates found in aquatic habitats throughout the world . Most are infaunal and live buried in sediment on the seabed , or in the sediment in freshwater habitats . A large number of bivalve species are found in the intertidal and sublittoral zones of the oceans . A sandy sea beach may superficially appear to be devoid of life , but often a very large number of bivalves and other invertebrates are living beneath the surface of the sand . On a large beach in South Wales , careful sampling produced an estimate of 1 @.@ 44 million cockles ( <unk> edule ) per acre of beach . 
 Bivalves inhabit the tropics , as well as temperate and boreal waters . A number of species can survive and even flourish in extreme conditions . They are abundant in the Arctic , about 140 species being known from that zone . The Antarctic scallop , Adamussium colbecki , lives under the sea ice at the other end of the globe , where the subzero temperatures mean that growth rates are very slow . The giant mussel , Bathymodiolus thermophilus , and the giant white clam , <unk> <unk> , both live clustered around hydrothermal vents at abyssal depths in the Pacific Ocean . They have chemosymbiotic bacteria in their gills that oxidise hydrogen sulphide , and the molluscs absorb nutrients synthesized by these bacteria . The saddle oyster , <unk> <unk> , is a marine species that could be considered amphibious . It lives above the high tide mark in the tropical Indo @-@ Pacific on the underside of mangrove leaves , on mangrove branches , and on sea walls in the splash zone . 
 Some freshwater bivalves have very restricted ranges . For example , the Ouachita <unk> mussel , <unk> <unk> , is known only from the streams of the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas and Oklahoma , and like several other freshwater mussel species from the southeastern US , it is in danger of extinction . In contrast , a few species of freshwater bivalves , including the golden mussel ( <unk> <unk> ) , are dramatically increasing their ranges . The golden mussel has spread from Southeast Asia to Argentina , where it has become an invasive species . Another well @-@ travelled freshwater bivalve , the zebra mussel ( Dreissena polymorpha ) originated in southeastern Russia , and has been accidentally introduced to inland waterways in North America and Europe , where the species damages water installations and disrupts local ecosystems . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Most bivalves adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle , often spending their whole lives in the area in which they first settled as juveniles . The majority of bivalves are infaunal , living under the seabed , buried in soft substrates such as sand , silt , mud , gravel , or coral fragments . Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out . When buried in the sediment , burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves , desiccation , and overheating during low tide , and variations in salinity caused by rainwater . They are also out of the reach of many predators . Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide , but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out . They use their muscular foot to dig into the substrate . To do this , the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate . Then it dilates the tip of its foot , retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell , shortens its foot and draws itself downwards . This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper . 
 Other bivalves , such as mussels , attach themselves to hard surfaces using tough byssus threads made of keratin and proteins . They are more exposed to attack by predators than the burrowing bivalves . Certain carnivorous gastropod snails such as whelks ( <unk> ) and murex snails ( <unk> ) feed on bivalves by boring into their shells , although many <unk> whelks ( e.g. , Busycon <unk> , Busycon <unk> ) are " chipping @-@ style " predators . The dog whelk ( <unk> <unk> ) drills a hole with its radula assisted by a shell @-@ dissolving secretion . The dog whelk then inserts its extendible proboscis and sucks out the body contents of the victim , which is typically a blue mussel . The whelk needs a few hours to penetrate the shell and thus living in the littoral zone is an advantage to the bivalve because the gastropod can attempt to bore through the shell only when the tide is in . 
 Some bivalves , including the true oysters , the jewel boxes , the jingle shells , the thorny oysters and the kitten 's paws , cement themselves to stones , rock or larger dead shells . In oysters the lower valve may be almost flat while the upper valve develops layer upon layer of thin horny material reinforced with calcium carbonate . Oysters sometimes occur in dense beds in the neritic zone and , like most bivalves , are filter feeders . 
 Bivalves filter large amounts of water to feed and breathe but they are not permanently open . They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state , even when they are permanently submerged . In oysters , for example , their behaviour follows very strict <unk> and circadian rhythms according to the relative positions of the moon and sun . During neap tides , they exhibit much longer closing periods than during spring tides . 
 Although many non @-@ sessile bivalves use their muscular foot to move around , or to dig , members of the freshwater family <unk> are exceptional in that these small clams climb about quite nimbly on weeds using their long and flexible foot . The European fingernail clam ( <unk> corneum ) , for example , climbs around on water weeds at the edges of lakes and ponds ; this enables the clam to find the best position for filter feeding . 
 = = = Predators and defence = = = 
 The thick shell and rounded shape of bivalves make them awkward for potential predators to tackle . Nevertheless , a number of different creatures include them in their diet . Many species of demersal fish feed on them including the common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) , which is being used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel ( Dreissena polymorpha ) . Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher ( Haematopus <unk> ) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells . The herring gull ( Larus argentatus ) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open . Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones balanced on their chests as anvils on which to crack open the shells . The Pacific walrus ( Odobenus rosmarus divergens ) is one of the main predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters . Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times , a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens . Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth . 
 Invertebrate predators include crabs , starfish and octopuses . Crabs crack the shells with their pincers and starfish use their water vascular system to force the valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve 's body . It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate . This was probably because they could manipulate the shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles . Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force , or they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents . 
 Razor shells can dig themselves into the sand with great speed to escape predation . When a Pacific razor clam ( Siliqua patula ) is laid on the surface of the beach it can bury itself completely in seven seconds and the Atlantic jackknife clam , <unk> <unk> , can do the same within fifteen seconds . Scallops and file clams can swim by opening and closing their valves rapidly ; water is ejected on either side of the hinge area and they move with the flapping valves in front . Scallops have simple eyes around the margin of the mantle and can clap their valves shut to move sharply , hinge first , to escape from danger . Cockles can use their foot to move across the seabed or leap away from threats . The foot is first extended before being contracted suddenly when it acts like a spring , projecting the animal forwards . 
 In many bivalves that have siphons , they can be retracted back into the safety of the shell . If the siphons inadvertently get attacked by a predator , they snap off . The animal can regenerate them later , a process that starts when the cells close to the damaged site become activated and remodel the tissue back to its pre @-@ existing form and size . 
 File shells such as <unk> fragilis can produce a noxious secretion when stressed . It has numerous tentacles which fringe its mantle and protrude some distance from the shell when it is feeding . If attacked , it sheds tentacles in a process known as autotomy . The toxin released by this is distasteful and the detached tentacles continue to writhe which may also serve to distract potential predators .

 Oysters , mussels , clams , scallops and other bivalve species are grown with food materials that occur naturally in their culture environment in the sea and lagoons . One @-@ third of the world ’ s farmed food fish harvested in 2010 was achieved without the use of feed , through the production of bivalves and filter @-@ feeding carps . European flat oysters ( Ostrea edulis ) were first farmed by the Romans in shallow ponds and similar techniques are still in use . Seed oysters are either raised in a hatchery or harvested from the wild . Hatchery production provides some control of the broodstock but remains problematic because disease @-@ resistant strains of this oyster have not yet been developed . Wild spats are harvested either by broadcasting empty mussel shells on the seabed or by the use of long , small @-@ mesh nets filled with mussel shells supported on steel frames . The oyster larvae preferentially settle out on the mussel shells . Juvenile oysters are then grown on in nursery trays and are transferred to open waters when they reach 5 to 6 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 20 to 0 @.@ 24 in ) in length . 
 Many juveniles are further reared off the seabed in suspended rafts , on floating trays or cemented to ropes . Here they are largely free from bottom @-@ dwelling predators such as starfish and crabs but more labour is required to tend them . They can be harvested by hand when they reach a suitable size . Other juveniles are laid directly on the seabed at the rate of 50 to 100 kilograms ( 110 to 220 lb ) per hectare . They grow on for about two years before being harvested by dredging . Survival rates are low at about 5 % . 
 The Pacific oyster ( Crassostrea gigas ) is cultivated by similar methods but in larger volumes and in many more regions of the world . This oyster originated in Japan where it has been cultivated for many centuries . It is an estuarine species and prefers salinities of 20 to 25 parts per thousand . Breeding programmes have produced improved stock that is available from hatcheries . A single female oyster can produce 50 – 80 million eggs in a batch so the selection of broodstock is of great importance . The larvae are grown on in tanks of static or moving water . They are fed high quality microalgae and diatoms and grow fast . At metamorphosis the juveniles may be allowed to settle on PVC sheets or pipes , or crushed shell . In some cases , they continue their development in " upwelling culture " in large tanks of moving water rather than being allowed to settle on the bottom . They then may be transferred to transitional , nursery beds before being moved to their final rearing quarters . Culture there takes place on the bottom , in plastic trays , in mesh bags , on rafts or on long lines , either in shallow water or in the intertidal zone . The oysters are ready for harvesting in 18 to 30 months depending on the size required . 
 Similar techniques are used in different parts of the world to cultivate other species including the Sydney rock oyster ( <unk> <unk> ) , the northern quahog ( Mercenaria mercenaria ) , the blue mussel ( Mytilus edulis ) , the Mediterranean mussel ( Mytilus <unk> ) , the New Zealand green @-@ lipped mussel ( Perna <unk> ) , the grooved carpet shell ( <unk> <unk> ) , the Japanese carpet shell ( <unk> <unk> ) , the pullet carpet shell ( <unk> <unk> ) and the <unk> scallop ( <unk> <unk> ) .

 = = Use as food = = 
 Bivalves have been an important source of food for humans at least since Roman times and empty shells found in middens at archaeological sites are evidence of earlier consumption . Oysters , scallops , clams , ark clams , mussels and cockles are the most commonly consumed kinds of bivalve , and are eaten cooked or raw . In 1950 , the year in which the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) started making such information available , world trade in bivalve molluscs was 1 @,@ 007 @,@ 419 tons . By 2010 , world trade in bivalves had risen to 14 @,@ 616 @,@ 172 tons , up from 10 @,@ 293 @,@ 607 tons a decade earlier . The figures included 5 @,@ 554 @,@ 348 ( 3 @,@ 152 @,@ 826 ) tons of clams , cockles and ark shells , 1 @,@ 901 @,@ 314 ( 1 @,@ 568 @,@ 417 ) tons of mussels , 4 @,@ 592 @,@ 529 ( 3 @,@ 858 @,@ 911 ) tons of oysters and 2 @,@ 567 @,@ 981 ( 1 @,@ 713 @,@ 453 ) tons of scallops . China increased its consumption 400 @-@ fold during the period 1970 to 1997 . 
 It has been known for more than a century that consumption of raw or insufficiently cooked shellfish can be associated with infectious diseases . These are caused either by bacteria naturally present in the sea such as Vibrio spp. or by viruses and bacteria from sewage effluent that sometimes contaminates coastal waters . As filter feeders , bivalves pass large quantities of water through their gills , filtering out the organic particles , including the microbial pathogens . These are retained in the animals ' tissues and become concentrated in their liver @-@ like digestive glands . Another possible source of contamination occurs when bivalves contain marine <unk> as a result of ingesting numerous dinoflagellates . These microalgae are not associated with sewage but occur unpredictably as algal blooms . Large areas of a sea or lake may change colour as a result of the proliferation of millions of single @-@ cell algae , and this condition is known as a red tide . 
 = = = Viral and bacterial infections = = = 
 In 1816 in France , a physician , J. P. A. Pasquier , described an outbreak of typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters . The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894 . As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century , more outbreaks took place . This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats . A causal link between the bivalves and the illness was not easy to demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish . One viral pathogen is the Norwalk virus . This is resistant to treatment with chlorine @-@ containing chemicals and may be present in the marine environment even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the treatment of sewage . 
 In 1975 in the United States , a serious outbreak of oyster @-@ vectored disease was caused by Vibrio <unk> . Although the number of victims was low , the mortality rate was high at 50 % . About 10 cases have occurred annually since then and further research needs to be done to establish the epidemiology of the infections . The cases peak in mid @-@ summer and autumn with no cases being reported in mid winter so there may be a link between the temperature at which the oysters are held between harvesting and consumption . In 1978 , an oyster @-@ associated gastrointestinal infection affecting more than 2 @,@ 000 people occurred in Australia . The causative agent was found to be the Norwalk virus and the epidemic caused major economic difficulties to the oyster farming industry in the country . In 1988 , an outbreak of hepatitis A associated with the consumption of inadequately cooked clams ( <unk> <unk> ) took place in the Shanghai area of China . An estimated 290 @,@ 000 people were infected and there were 47 deaths . 
 In the United States and the European Union , since the early 1990s regulations have been in place that are designed to prevent shellfish from contaminated waters entering the food chain . This has meant that there is sometimes a shortage of regulated shellfish , with consequent higher prices . This has led to illegal harvesting and sale of shellfish on the black market , which can be a health hazard . 
 = = = Paralytic shellfish poisoning = = = 
 Paralytic shellfish poisoning ( PSP ) is primarily caused by the consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates , single @-@ celled protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters . <unk> is the most virulent of these . In mild cases , PSP causes tingling , numbness , sickness and diarrhoea . In more severe cases , the muscles of the chest wall may be affected leading to paralysis and even death . In 1937 , researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these phytoplankton and PSP . The <unk> remains potent even when the shellfish are well @-@ cooked . In the United States , there is a regulatory limit of 80 µg / g of <unk> equivalent in shellfish meat . 
 = = = <unk> shellfish poisoning = = = 
 <unk> shellfish poisoning ( ASP ) was first reported in eastern Canada in 1987 . It is caused by the substance domoic acid found in certain diatoms of the genus Pseudo @-@ <unk> . Bivalves can become toxic when they filter these microalgae out of the water . <unk> acid is a low @-@ molecular weight amino acid that is able to destroy brain cells causing memory loss , gastroenteritis , long @-@ term neurological problems or death . In an outbreak in the western United States in 1993 , finfish were also implicated as vectors , and seabirds and mammals suffered neurological symptoms . In the United States and Canada , a regulatory limit of 20 µg / g of domoic acid in shellfish meat is set . 
 = = Use in controlling pollution = = 
 When they live in polluted waters , bivalve molluscs have a tendency to accumulate substances such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in their tissues . This is because they ingest the chemicals as they feed but their enzyme systems are not capable of metabolising them and as a result , the levels build up . This may be a health hazard for the molluscs themselves , and is one for humans who eat them . It also has certain advantages in that bivalves can be used in monitoring the presence and quantity of pollutants in their environment . 
 There are limitations to the use of bivalves as bioindicators . The level of pollutants found in the tissues varies with species , age , size , time of year and other factors . The quantities of pollutants in the water may vary and the molluscs may reflect past rather than present values . In a study of several bivalve species present in lagoons in Ghana it was found that the findings could be anomalous . Levels of zinc and iron tended to rise in the wet season due to run @-@ off from the galvanized roofing sheets used in many of the houses . Cadmium levels were lower in young animals than in older ones because they were growing so fast that , despite the fact that their bodies were accumulating the metal , the concentration in their tissues reduced . In a study near Vladivostok it was found that the level of pollutants in the bivalve tissues did not always reflect the high levels in the surrounding sediment in such places as harbours . The reason for this was thought to be that the bivalves in these locations did not need to filter so much water as elsewhere because of the water 's high nutritional content . 
 A study of nine different bivalves with widespread distributions in tropical marine waters concluded that the mussel , <unk> hirsuta , most nearly reflected in its tissues the level of heavy metals ( Pb , Cd , Cu , Zn , Co , Ni , and Ag ) in its environment . In this species there was a linear relationship between the sedimentary levels and the tissue concentration of all the metals except zinc . In the Persian Gulf , the Atlantic pearl @-@ oyster ( Pinctada radiata ) is considered to be a useful bioindicator of heavy metals . 
 Crushed shells , available as a by @-@ product of the seafood canning industry , can be used to remove pollutants from water . It has been found that , as long as the water is maintained at an alkaline pH , crushed shells will remove cadmium , lead and other heavy metals from contaminated waters by swapping the calcium in their constituent aragonite for the heavy metal , and retaining these pollutants in a solid form . The rock oyster ( <unk> cucullata ) has been shown to reduce the levels of copper and cadmium in contaminated waters in the Persian Gulf . The live animals acted as <unk> , selectively removing these metals , and the dead shells also had the ability to reduce their concentration .

 <unk> is the scientific study of mollusc shells , but the term conchologist is also sometimes used to describe a collector of shells . Many people pick up shells on the beach or purchase them and display them in their homes . There are many private and public collections of mollusc shells , but the largest one in the world is at the Smithsonian Institution , which houses in excess of 20 million specimens . 
 Shells are used decoratively in many ways . They can be pressed into concrete or plaster to make decorative paths , steps or walls and can be used to embellish picture frames , mirrors or other craft items . They can be stacked up and glued together to make ornaments . They can be pierced and threaded onto necklaces or made into other forms of jewellery . Shells have had various uses in the past as body decorations , utensils , scrapers and cutting implements . Carefully cut and shaped shell tools dating back 32 @,@ 000 years have been found in a cave in Indonesia . In this region , shell technology may have been developed in preference to the use of stone or bone implements , perhaps because of the scarcity of suitable rock materials . 
 The indigenous peoples of the Americas living near the east coast used pieces of shell as wampum . The channeled whelk ( <unk> <unk> ) and the quahog ( Mercenaria mercenaria ) were used to make white and purple traditional patterns . The shells were cut , rolled , polished and drilled before being strung together and woven into belts . These were used for personal , social and ceremonial purposes and also , at a later date , for currency . The Winnebago Tribe from Wisconsin had numerous uses for freshwater mussels including using them as spoons , cups , ladles and utensils . They notched them to provide knives , graters and saws . They carved them into fish hooks and lures . They incorporated powdered shell into clay to temper their pottery vessels . They used them as scrapers for removing flesh from hides and for separating the scalps of their victims . They used shells as scoops for gouging out fired logs when building canoes and they drilled holes in them and fitted wooden handles for tilling the ground . 
 Buttons have traditionally been made from a variety of freshwater and marine shells . At first they were used decoratively rather than as fasteners and the earliest known example dates back five thousand years and was found at Mohenjo @-@ daro in the Indus Valley . 
 Sea silk is a fine fabric woven from the byssus threads of bivalves , particularly the pen shell ( Pinna nobilis ) . It used to be produced in the Mediterranean region where these shells are endemic . It was an expensive fabric and overfishing has much reduced populations of the pen shell . There is mention in the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone ( 196 BCE ) of this cloth being used to pay taxes . 
 Crushed shells are added as a calcareous supplement to the diet of laying poultry . Oyster shell and cockle shell are often used for this purpose and are obtained as a by @-@ product from other industries . 
 = = = Pearls and mother @-@ of @-@ pearl = = = 
 Mother @-@ of @-@ pearl or nacre is the naturally occurring lustrous layer that lines some mollusc shells . It is used to make pearl buttons and in artisan craftwork to make organic jewellery . It has traditionally been inlaid into furniture and boxes , particularly in China . It has been used to decorate musical instruments , watches , pistols , fans and other products . The import and export of goods made with nacre are controlled in many countries under the International Convention of Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora . 
 A pearl is created in the mantle of a mollusc when an irritant particle is surrounded by layers of nacre . Although most bivalves can create pearls , oysters in the family <unk> and freshwater mussels in the families Unionidae and <unk> are the main source of commercially available pearls because the calcareous concretions produced by most other species have no lustre . Finding pearls inside oysters is a very chancy business as hundreds of shells may need to be prised open before a single pearl can be found . Most pearls are now obtained from cultured shells where an irritant substance has been purposefully introduced to induce the formation of a pearl . A " <unk> " ( irregular ) pearl can be grown by the insertion of an implant , usually made of plastic , under a flap of the mantle and next to the mother @-@ of @-@ pearl interior of the shell . A more difficult procedure is the grafting of a piece of oyster mantle into the gonad of an adult specimen together with the insertion of a shell bead nucleus . This produces a superior , spherical pearl . The animal can be opened to extract the pearl after about two years and reseeded so that it produces another pearl . Pearl oyster farming and pearl culture is an important industry in Japan and many other countries bordering the Indian and Pacific Oceans . 
 = = = Symbolism = = = 
 The scallop is the symbol of St James and is called Coquille Saint @-@ Jacques in French . It is an emblem carried by pilgrims on their way to the shrine of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia . The shell became associated with the pilgrimage and came to be used as a symbol showing <unk> along the route and later as a sign of hospitality , food and lodging elsewhere . 
 Roman myth has it that Venus , the goddess of love , was born in the sea and emerged accompanied by fish and dolphins , with Botticelli depicting her as arriving in a scallop shell . The Romans revered her and erected shrines in her honour in their gardens , praying to her to provide water and verdant growth . From this , the scallop and other bivalve shells came to be used as a symbol for fertility . Its depiction is used in architecture , furniture and fabric design and it is the logo of Royal Dutch Shell , the global oil and gas company . 
 = = <unk> taxonomies = = 
 For the past two centuries no consensus has existed on bivalve phylogeny from the many classifications developed . In earlier taxonomic systems , experts used a single characteristic feature for their classifications , choosing among shell morphology , hinge type or gill type . Conflicting naming schemes proliferated due to these taxonomies based on single organ systems . One of the most widely accepted systems was that put forward by Norman D. Newell in Part N of the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology , which employed a classification system based on general shell shape , microstructures and hinge configuration . Because features such as hinge morphology , dentition , mineralogy , shell morphology and shell composition change slowly over time , these characteristics can be used to define major taxonomic groups . 
 Since the year 2000 , taxonomic studies using cladistical analyses of multiple organ systems , shell morphology ( including fossil species ) and modern molecular phylogenetics have resulted in the drawing up of what experts believe is a more accurate phylogeny of the Bivalvia . Based upon these studies , a new proposed classification system for the Bivalvia was published in 2010 by Bieler , Carter & Coan . In 2012 , this new system was adopted by the World Register of Marine Species ( <unk> ) for the classification of the Bivalvia . Some experts still maintain that <unk> should be considered a separate subclass , whereas the new system treats it as the order Anomalodesmata , within the subclass Heterodonta . Molecular phylogenetic work continues , further clarifying which Bivalvia are most closely related and thus refining the classification . 
 = = = Practical taxonomy of R.C. Moore = = = 
 R.C. Moore , in Moore , <unk> , and Fischer , 1952 , Invertebrate Fossils , gives a practical and useful classification of pelecypods ( Bivalvia ) even if somewhat antiquated , based on shell structure , gill type , and hinge teeth configuration . <unk> and orders given are : 
 Subclass : <unk> 
 Order 
 <unk> 
 <unk> : Many teeth ( e.g. order <unk> ) 
 <unk> : Big bifurcating teeth ( e.g. <unk> spp . ) 
 <unk> : Equal teeth ( e.g. Spondylus spp . ) 
 <unk> : Absent teeth and ligaments joins the valves . 
 Subclass : <unk> 
 Order 
 Heterodonta : Different teeth ( e.g. family <unk> ) . [ Lower Ordovician – Recent ] 
 <unk> : Large , different , deformed teeth ( e.g. <unk> spp . ) . [ Late Jurassic – Upper Cretaceous ] 
 <unk> : Hinge @-@ teeth absent or irregular with ligaments ( e.g. family <unk> ) . 
 <unk> have a prismatic and nacreous shell structure , separated mantle lobes , poorly developed siphons , and hinge teeth that are lacking or unspecialized . Gills range from <unk> to <unk> . <unk> on the other hand have a <unk> and partly nacreous shell structure ; Mantle lobes that are generally connected , well developed siphons , and specialized hinge teeth .

 In his 1935 work Handbuch der <unk> <unk> ( Handbook of Systematic <unk> ) , Johannes Thiele introduced a mollusc taxonomy based upon the 1909 work by Cossmann and <unk> . Thiele 's system divided the bivalves into three orders . <unk> consisted of forms that had <unk> dentition , with a series of small parallel teeth perpendicular to the hinge line . <unk> consisted of forms that had either a single adductor muscle or one adductor muscle much smaller than the other . <unk> consisted of forms with ctenidial gills . The <unk> was further divided into four suborders : <unk> , Heterodonta , <unk> and Anomalodesmata .

 An alternative systematic scheme exists using gill morphology . This distinguishes between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The first corresponds to Newell 's <unk> and <unk> , the second to his <unk> , with the last corresponding to all other groups . In addition , Franc separated the <unk> from his <unk> because of the morphological differences between them . The <unk> belong to the superfamily <unk> and are carnivorous , having a muscular septum instead of filamentous gills .

 In May 2010 , a new taxonomy of the Bivalvia was published in the journal <unk> . In compiling this , the authors used a variety of phylogenetic information including molecular analysis , anatomical analysis , shell morphology and shell microstructure as well as bio @-@ geographic , <unk> and stratigraphic information . In this classification 324 families are recognized as valid , 214 of which are known exclusively from fossils and 110 of which occur in the recent past , with or without a fossil record . This classification has since been adopted by <unk> .

 Samarium is a chemical element with symbol Sm and atomic number 62 . It is a moderately hard silvery metal that readily oxidizes in air . Being a typical member of the lanthanide series , samarium usually assumes the oxidation state + 3 . Compounds of samarium ( II ) are also known , most notably the monoxide SmO , <unk> SmS , SmSe and SmTe , as well as samarium ( II ) iodide . The last compound is a common reducing agent in chemical synthesis . Samarium has no significant biological role and is only slightly toxic . 
 Samarium was discovered in 1879 by the French chemist Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran and named after the mineral samarskite from which it was isolated . The mineral itself was earlier named after a Russian mine official , Colonel Vasili Samarsky @-@ Bykhovets , who thereby became the first person to have a chemical element named after him , albeit indirectly . Although classified as a rare earth element , samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth 's crust and is more common than such metals as tin . Samarium occurs with concentration up to 2 @.@ 8 % in several minerals including cerite , gadolinite , samarskite , monazite and bastnäsite , the last two being the most common commercial sources of the element . These minerals are mostly found in China , the United States , Brazil , India , Sri Lanka and Australia ; China is by far the world leader in samarium mining and production . 
 The major commercial application of samarium is in samarium @-@ cobalt magnets , which have permanent magnetization second only to neodymium magnets ; however , samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures , above 700 ° C ( 1 @,@ 292 ° F ) , without losing their magnetic properties , due to the alloy 's higher Curie point . The radioactive isotope samarium @-@ 153 is the major component of the drug samarium ( 153Sm ) <unk> ( <unk> ) , which kills cancer cells in the treatment of lung cancer , prostate cancer , breast cancer and osteosarcoma . Another isotope , samarium @-@ 149 , is a strong neutron absorber and is therefore added to the control rods of nuclear reactors . It is also formed as a decay product during the reactor operation and is one of the important factors considered in the reactor design and operation . Other applications of samarium include catalysis of chemical reactions , radioactive dating and an X @-@ ray laser . 
 = = Physical properties = = 
 Samarium is a rare earth metal having the hardness and density similar to those of zinc . With the boiling point of 1794 ° C , samarium is the third most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium and europium ; this property facilitates separation of samarium from the mineral ore . At ambient conditions , samarium normally assumes a rhombohedral structure ( α form ) . Upon heating to 731 ° C , its crystal symmetry changes into hexagonally close @-@ packed ( hcp ) , however the transition temperature depends on the metal purity . Further heating to 922 ° C transforms the metal into a body @-@ centered cubic ( bcc ) phase . Heating to 300 ° C combined with compression to 40 kbar results in a double @-@ hexagonally close @-@ packed structure ( dhcp ) . Applying higher pressure of the order of hundreds or thousands of <unk> induces a series of phase transformations , in particular with a tetragonal phase appearing at about 900 kbar . In one study , the dhcp phase could be produced without compression , using a <unk> annealing regime with a rapid temperature change between about 400 and 700 ° C , confirming the transient character of this samarium phase . Also , thin films of samarium obtained by vapor deposition may contain the hcp or dhcp phases at ambient conditions . 
 Samarium ( and its sesquioxide ) are paramagnetic at room temperature . Their corresponding effective magnetic moments , below <unk> , are the 3rd lowest among the lanthanides ( and their oxides ) after lanthanum and lutetium . The metal transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to 14 @.@ 8 K. Individual samarium atoms can be isolated by encapsulating them into fullerene molecules . They can also be doped between the C60 molecules in the fullerene solid , rendering it superconductive at temperatures below 8 K. Samarium doping of iron @-@ based superconductors – the most recent class of high @-@ temperature superconductors – allows to enhance their transition temperature to 56 K , which is the highest value achieved so far in this series . 
 = = Chemical properties = = 
 Freshly prepared samarium has a silvery luster . In air , it slowly oxidizes at room temperature and spontaneously ignites at 150 ° C. Even when stored under mineral oil , samarium gradually oxidizes and develops a grayish @-@ yellow powder of the oxide @-@ hydroxide mixture at the surface . The metallic appearance of a sample can be preserved by sealing it under an inert gas such as argon . 
 Samarium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form samarium hydroxide : 
 2 Sm ( s ) + 6 H2O ( l ) → 2 Sm ( OH ) 3 ( aq ) + 3 H2 ( g ) 
 Samarium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the yellow to pale green Sm ( III ) ions , which exist as [ Sm ( OH2 ) 9 ] 3 + complexes : 
 2 Sm ( s ) + 3 H2SO4 ( aq ) → 2 Sm3 + ( aq ) + 3 SO2 − 
 4 ( aq ) + 3 H2 ( g ) 
 Samarium is one of the few lanthanides that exhibit the oxidation state + 2 . The Sm2 + ions are blood @-@ red in aqueous solution .

 The most stable oxide of samarium is the sesquioxide Sm2O3 . As many other samarium compounds , it exists in several crystalline phases . The trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from the melt . The melting point of Sm2O3 is rather high ( 2345 ° C ) and therefore melting is usually achieved not by direct heating , but with induction heating , through a radio @-@ frequency coil . The Sm2O3 crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by the flame fusion method ( Verneuil process ) from the Sm2O3 powder , that yields cylindrical <unk> up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter . The <unk> are transparent when pure and defect @-@ free and are orange otherwise . Heating the metastable trigonal Sm2O3 to 1900 ° C converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase . Cubic Sm2O3 has also been described . 
 Samarium is one of the few lanthanides that form a monoxide , SmO . This lustrous golden @-@ yellow compound was obtained by reducing Sm2O3 with samarium metal at elevated temperature ( 1000 ° C ) and pressure above 50 kbar ; lowering the pressure resulted in an incomplete reaction . SmO has the cubic rock @-@ salt lattice structure . 
 = = = Chalcogenides = = = 
 Samarium forms trivalent sulfide , selenide and telluride . Divalent chalcogenides SmS , SmSe and SmTe with cubic rock @-@ salt crystal structure are also known . They are remarkable by converting from semiconducting to metallic state at room temperature upon application of pressure . Whereas the transition is continuous and occurs at about 20 – 30 kbar in SmSe and SmTe , it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6 @.@ 5 kbar . This effect results in spectacular color change in SmS from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished . The transition does not change lattice symmetry , but there is a sharp decrease ( ~ 15 % ) in the crystal volume . It shows hysteresis , that is when the pressure is released , SmS returns to the semiconducting state at much lower pressure of about 0 @.@ 4 kbar . 
 = = = Halides = = = 
 Samarium metal reacts with all the halogens , forming trihalides : 
 2 Sm ( s ) + 3 X2 ( g ) → 2 <unk> ( s ) ( X = F , Cl , Br or I ) 
 Their further reduction with samarium , lithium or sodium metals at elevated temperatures ( about 700 – 900 ° C ) yields dihalides . The diiodide can also be prepared by heating <unk> , or by reacting the metal with 1 @,@ 2 @-@ <unk> in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran at room temperature : 
 Sm ( s ) + <unk> @-@ <unk> → <unk> + CH2 = CH2 . 
 In addition to dihalides , the reduction also produces numerous non @-@ stoichiometric samarium halides with a well @-@ defined crystal structure , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 As reflected in the table above , samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another , which is an uncommon behavior for most elements ( e.g. actinides ) . Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition , one being significantly more stable and another being metastable . The latter is formed upon compression or heating , followed by quenching to ambient conditions . For example , compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a <unk> @-@ type orthorhombic structure ( density 5 @.@ 90 g / cm3 ) , and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide ( density 5 @.@ 97 g / cm3 ) . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 <unk> powders of samarium oxide and boron , in vacuum , yields a powder containing several samarium boride phases , and their volume ratio can be controlled through the mixing proportion . The powder can be converted into larger crystals of a certain samarium boride using arc melting or zone melting techniques , relying on the different melting / crystallization temperature of SmB6 ( <unk> ° C ) , <unk> ( about 2300 ° C ) and <unk> ( 2150 ° C ) . All these materials are hard , brittle , dark @-@ gray solids with the hardness increasing with the boron content . Samarium diboride is too volatile to be produced with these methods and requires high pressure ( about 65 kbar ) and low temperatures between 1140 and 1240 ° C to stabilize its growth . Increasing the temperature results in the preferential formations of SmB6 . 
 = = = = Samarium hexaboride = = = = 
 Samarium hexaboride is a typical intermediate @-@ valence compound where samarium is present both as Sm2 + and Sm3 + ions at the ratio 3 : 7 . It belongs to a class of Kondo insulators , that is at high temperatures ( above 50 K ) , its properties are typical of a Kondo metal , with metallic electrical conductivity characterized by strong electron scattering , whereas at low temperatures , it behaves as a non @-@ magnetic insulator with a narrow band gap of about 4 – 14 meV . The cooling @-@ induced metal @-@ insulator transition in SmB6 is accompanied by a sharp increase in the thermal conductivity , peaking at about 15 K. The reason for this increase is that electrons themselves do not contribute to the thermal conductivity at low temperatures , which is dominated by phonons , but the decrease in electron concentration reduced the rate of electron @-@ phonon scattering . 
 New research seems to show that it may be a topological insulator .

 Samarium carbides are prepared by melting a graphite @-@ metal mixture in an inert atmosphere . After the synthesis , they are unstable in air and are studied also under inert atmosphere . Samarium <unk> <unk> is a semiconductor with the bandgap of 1 @.@ 10 eV , the same as in silicon , and high electrical conductivity of n @-@ type . It can be prepared by annealing at 1100 ° C an evacuated quartz <unk> containing mixed powders of phosphorus and samarium . Phosphorus is highly volatile at high temperatures and may explode , thus the heating rate has to be kept well below 1 ° C / min . Similar procedure is adopted for the <unk> <unk> , but the synthesis temperature is higher at 1800 ° C. 
 Numerous crystalline binary compounds are known for samarium and one of the group @-@ 4 , 5 or 6 element X , where X is Si , Ge , Sn , Pb , Sb or Te , and metallic alloys of samarium form another large group . They are all prepared by annealing mixed powders of the corresponding elements .

 Samarium forms a cyclopentadienide Sm ( C5H5 ) 3 and its <unk> Sm ( C5H5 ) 2Cl and Sm ( C5H5 ) Cl2 . They are prepared by reacting samarium trichloride with NaC5H5 in tetrahydrofuran . Contrary to <unk> of most other lanthanides , in Sm ( C5H5 ) 3 some C5H5 rings bridge each other by forming ring <unk> η1 or edges η2 toward another neighboring samarium atom , thereby creating polymeric chains . The <unk> Sm ( C5H5 ) 2Cl has a dimer structure , which is more accurately expressed as ( η5 @-@ C5H5 ) <unk> ( µ @-@ Cl ) 2 ( η5 @-@ C5H5 ) 2 . There , the chlorine bridges can be replaced , for instance , by iodine , hydrogen or nitrogen atoms or by CN groups . 
 The ( C5H5 ) − ion in samarium <unk> can be replaced by the <unk> ( <unk> ) − or cyclooctatetraenide ( C8H8 ) 2 − ring , resulting in Sm ( <unk> ) 3 or <unk> ( η8 @-@ C8H8 ) 2 . The latter compound has a similar structure to that of uranocene . There is also a cyclopentadienide of divalent samarium , Sm ( C5H5 ) 2 – a solid that sublimates at about 85 ° C. Contrary to ferrocene , the C5H5 rings in Sm ( C5H5 ) 2 are not parallel but are tilted by 40 ° . 
 <unk> and <unk> of samarium are obtained through a metathesis reaction in tetrahydrofuran or ether : 
 <unk> + 3 <unk> → <unk> + 3 LiCl 
 Sm ( OR ) 3 + 3 <unk> ( <unk> ) 2 → Sm { CH ( <unk> ) 2 } 3 + 3 <unk>

 The long @-@ lived isotopes , <unk> , 147Sm , and <unk> , primarily decay by emission of alpha particles to isotopes of neodymium . Lighter unstable isotopes of samarium primarily decay by electron capture to isotopes of promethium , while heavier ones convert through beta decay to isotopes of europium . 
 The alpha @-@ decay of 147Sm to <unk> with a half @-@ life of 1 @.@ 06 × 1011 years serve for samarium @-@ neodymium dating . 
 The half @-@ lives of <unk> and <unk> are 90 years and 340 days , respectively .

 = = History = = 
 Detection of samarium and related elements was announced by several scientists in the second half of the 19th century ; however , most sources give the priority to the French chemist Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran . Boisbaudran isolated samarium oxide and / or hydroxide in Paris in 1879 from the mineral samarskite ( ( Y , Ce , U , Fe ) 3 ( Nb , Ta , Ti ) <unk> ) and identified a new element in it via sharp optical absorption lines . The Swiss chemist Marc <unk> announced a new element <unk> ( from Latin : decipiens meaning " deceptive , misleading " ) in 1878 , but later in 1880 – 1881 demonstrated that it was a mixture of several elements , one being identical to the Boisbaudran 's samarium . Although samarskite was first found in the remote Russian region of Urals , by the late 1870s its deposits had been located in other places making the mineral available to many researchers . In particular , it was found that the samarium isolated by Boisbaudran was also impure and contained comparable amount of europium . The pure element was produced only in 1901 by Eugène @-@ Anatole <unk> . 
 Boisbaudran named his element samaria after the mineral samarskite , which in turn honored Vasili Samarsky @-@ Bykhovets ( 1803 – 1870 ) . Samarsky @-@ Bykhovets , as the Chief of Staff of the Russian Corps of Mining Engineers , had granted access for two German mineralogists , the brothers Gustav Rose and Heinrich Rose , to study the mineral samples from the Urals . In this sense samarium was the first chemical element to be named after a person . Later the name samaria used by Boisbaudran was transformed into samarium , to conform with other element names , and samaria nowadays is sometimes used to refer to samarium oxide , by analogy with yttria , zirconia , alumina , ceria , holmia , etc . The symbol Sm was suggested for samarium ; however an alternative Sa was frequently used instead until the 1920s . 
 Prior to the advent of ion @-@ exchange separation technology in the 1950s , samarium had no commercial uses in pure form . However , a by @-@ product of the fractional crystallization purification of neodymium was a mixture of samarium and gadolinium that acquired the name of " Lindsay Mix " after the company that made it . This material is thought to have been used for nuclear control rods in some early nuclear reactors . Nowadays , a similar commodity product has the name " samarium @-@ europium @-@ gadolinium " ( SEG ) concentrate . It is prepared by solvent extraction from the mixed lanthanides isolated from bastnäsite ( or monazite ) . Since the heavier lanthanides have the greater affinity for the solvent used , they are easily extracted from the bulk using relatively small proportions of solvent . Not all rare @-@ earth producers who process bastnäsite do so on a large enough scale to continue onward with the separation of the components of SEG , which typically makes up only one or two percent of the original ore . Such producers will therefore be making SEG with a view to marketing it to the specialized processors . In this manner , the valuable europium content of the ore is rescued for use in phosphor manufacture . Samarium purification follows the removal of the europium . As of 2012 , being in oversupply , samarium oxide is less expensive on a commercial scale than its relative abundance in the ore might suggest . 
 = = Occurrence and production = = 
 With the average concentration of about 8 parts per million ( ppm ) , samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth 's crust . It is the fifth most abundant lanthanide and is more common than elements such as tin . Samarium concentration in soils varies between 2 and 23 ppm , and oceans contain about 0 @.@ 5 – 0 @.@ 8 parts per trillion . Distribution of samarium in soils strongly depends on its chemical state and is very inhomogeneous : in sandy soils , samarium concentration is about 200 times higher at the surface of soil particles than in the water trapped between them , and this ratio can exceed 1 @,@ 000 in clays . 
 Samarium is not found free in nature , but , like other rare earth elements , is contained in many minerals , including monazite , bastnäsite , cerite , gadolinite and samarskite ; monazite ( in which samarium occurs at concentrations of up to 2 @.@ 8 % ) and bastnäsite are mostly used as commercial sources . World resources of samarium are estimated at two million tonnes ; they are mostly located in China , US , Brazil , India , Sri Lanka and Australia , and the annual production is about 700 tonnes . Country production reports are usually given for all rare @-@ earth metals combined . By far , China has the largest production with 120 @,@ 000 tonnes mined per year ; it is followed by the US ( about 5 @,@ 000 tonnes ) and India ( 2 @,@ 700 tonnes ) . Samarium is usually sold as oxide , which at the price of about 30 USD / kg is one of the cheapest lanthanide oxides . Whereas mischmetal – a mixture of rare earth metals containing about 1 % of samarium – has long been used , relatively pure samarium has been isolated only recently , through ion exchange processes , solvent extraction techniques , and electrochemical deposition . The metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of samarium ( III ) chloride with sodium chloride or calcium chloride . Samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with lanthanum . The product is then distilled to separate samarium ( boiling point 1794 ° C ) and lanthanum ( <unk> <unk> ° C ) . 
 Domination of samarium in minerals is unique . Minerals with essential ( dominant ) samarium include <unk> ( Sm ) and <unk> ( Sm ) . They are very rare . 
 Samarium @-@ 151 is produced in nuclear fission of uranium with the yield of about 0 @.@ 4 % of the total number of fission events . It is also synthesized upon neutron capture by samarium @-@ 149 , which is added to the control rods of nuclear reactors . Consequently , samarium @-@ 151 is present in spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste . 
 = = Applications = = 
 One of the most important applications of samarium is in samarium – cobalt magnets , which have a nominal composition of <unk> or <unk> . They have high permanent magnetization , which is about 10 @,@ 000 times that of iron and is second only to that of neodymium magnets . However , samarium @-@ based magnets have higher resistance to <unk> , as they are stable to temperatures above 700 ° C ( cf . 300 – 400 ° C for neodymium magnets ) . These magnets are found in small motors , headphones , and high @-@ end magnetic pickups for guitars and related musical instruments . For example , they are used in the motors of a solar @-@ powered electric aircraft , the Solar Challenger , and in the Samarium Cobalt <unk> electric guitar and bass pickups . 
 Another important application of samarium and its compounds is as catalyst and chemical reagent . Samarium catalysts assist decomposition of plastics , <unk> of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , as well as the dehydration and dehydrogenation of ethanol . Samarium ( III ) triflate ( Sm ( <unk> ) 3 , that is Sm ( <unk> ) 3 ) , is one of the most efficient Lewis acid catalysts for a halogen @-@ promoted Friedel – Crafts reaction with alkenes . Samarium ( II ) iodide is a very common reducing and coupling agent in organic synthesis , for example in the <unk> reactions ; <unk> ; Danishefsky , <unk> , <unk> and Holton Taxol total syntheses ; strychnine total synthesis ; Barbier reaction and other reductions with samarium ( II ) iodide . 
 In its usual oxidized form , samarium is added to ceramics and glasses where it increases absorption of infrared light . As a ( minor ) part of mischmetal , samarium is found in " flint " ignition device of many lighters and torches . 
 Radioactive samarium @-@ 153 is a beta emitter with a half @-@ life of 46 @.@ 3 hours . It is used to kill cancer cells in the treatment of lung cancer , prostate cancer , breast cancer , and osteosarcoma . For this purpose , samarium @-@ 153 is <unk> with ethylene diamine <unk> phosphonate ( <unk> ) and injected intravenously . The chelation prevents accumulation of radioactive samarium in the body that would result in excessive irradiation and generation of new cancer cells . The corresponding drug has several names including samarium ( 153Sm ) <unk> ; its trade name is <unk> . 
 Samarium @-@ 149 has high cross @-@ section for neutron capture ( 41 @,@ 000 barns ) and is therefore used in the control rods of nuclear reactors . Its advantage compared to competing materials , such as boron and cadmium , is stability of absorption – most of the fusion and decay products of samarium @-@ 149 are other isotopes of samarium that are also good neutron absorbers . For example , the cross section of samarium @-@ 151 is 15 @,@ 000 barns , it is on the order of hundreds of barns for <unk> , 152Sm , and 153Sm , and is 6 @,@ 800 barns for natural ( mixed @-@ isotope ) samarium . Among the decay products in a nuclear reactor , samarium @-@ 149 is regarded as the second most important for the reactor design and operation after xenon @-@ 135 .

 Samarium @-@ doped calcium fluoride crystals were used as an active medium in one of the first solid @-@ state lasers designed and constructed by Peter Sorokin ( co @-@ inventor of the dye laser ) and Mirek Stevenson at IBM research labs in early 1961 .

 Another samarium @-@ based laser became the first saturated X @-@ ray laser operating at wavelengths shorter than 10 nanometers . It provided 50 @-@ <unk> pulses at 7 @.@ 3 and 6 @.@ 8 nm suitable for applications in holography , high @-@ resolution microscopy of biological specimens , <unk> , interferometry , and radiography of dense plasmas related to confinement fusion and astrophysics . Saturated operation meant that the maximum possible power was extracted from the lasing medium , resulting in the high peak energy of 0 @.@ 3 <unk> . The active medium was samarium plasma produced by irradiating samarium @-@ coated glass with a pulsed infrared Nd @-@ glass laser ( wavelength ~ 1 @.@ 05 µm ) . 
 The change in electrical resistivity in samarium <unk> can be used in a pressure sensor or in a memory device triggered between a low @-@ resistance and high @-@ resistance state by external pressure , and such devices are being developed commercially . Samarium monosulfide also generates electric voltage upon moderate heating to about 150 ° C that can be applied in thermoelectric power converters . 
 The analysis of relative concentrations of samarium and neodymium isotopes 147Sm , <unk> , and <unk> allows the determination of the age and origin of rocks and meteorites in samarium @-@ neodymium dating . Both elements are lanthanides and have very similar physical and chemical properties . Therefore , Sm @-@ Nd dating is either insensitive to partitioning of the marker elements during various geological processes , or such partitioning can well be understood and modeled from the ionic radii of the involved elements . 
 The Sm3 + ion is a potential activator for use in warm @-@ white light emitting diodes . It offers high luminous efficacy due to the narrow emission bands , however , the generally low quantum efficiency and insufficient absorption in the UV @-@ A to blue spectral region hinders commercial application . 
 In recent years it has been demonstrated that nanocrystalline <unk> : Sm3 + as prepared by a co @-@ precipitation can serve as a very efficient x @-@ ray storage phosphor . The co @-@ precipitation leads to <unk> of the order of 100 @-@ 200 nm in size and their sensitivity as x @-@ ray storage phosphors is increased an astounding ∼ 500 @,@ 000 times because of the specific arrangements and density of defect centres in comparison with microcrystalline samples prepared by sintering at high temperature . The mechanism is based on the reduction of Sm3 + to Sm2 + by trapping electrons that are created upon exposure to ionizing radiation in the <unk> host . The 5 DJ @-@ 7 FJ f @-@ f luminescence lines can be very efficiently excited via the parity allowed <unk> → <unk> 5d transition at around 417 nm . The latter wavelength is ideal for efficient excitation by blue @-@ violet laser diodes as the transition is electric dipole allowed and thus relatively intense ( 400 l / ( mol ⋅ cm ) ) . The phosphor has potential applications in personal dosimetry , dosimetry and imaging in radiotherapy , and medical imaging . 
 = = Biological role = = 
 Samarium salts stimulate metabolism , but it is unclear whether this is the effect of samarium or other lanthanides present with it . The total amount of samarium in adults is about 50 µg , mostly in liver and kidneys and with about 8 µg / L being dissolved in the blood . Samarium is not absorbed by plants to a measurable concentration and therefore is normally not a part of human diet . However , a few plants and vegetables may contain up to 1 part per million of samarium . Insoluble salts of samarium are non @-@ toxic and the soluble ones are only slightly toxic . 
 When ingested , only about 0 @.@ 05 % of samarium salts is absorbed into the bloodstream and the remainder is excreted . From the blood , about 45 % goes to the liver and 45 % is deposited on the surface of the bones where it remains for about 10 years ; the balance 10 % is excreted .

 Released on seven discs after multiple delays , Phantasmagoria was a financial success , grossing $ 12 million in its opening weekend and becoming one of the best @-@ selling games of 1995 . It received positive to mixed reviews , earning praise for its graphics and suspenseful tone , but received criticism for its slow pacing and easy puzzles . The game drew controversy , particularly due to a rape scene . CompUSA and other retailers declined to carry it , religious organizations and politicians condemned it , and it was banned altogether in Australia . A sequel , Phantasmagoria : A Puzzle of Flesh , was released in 1996 , although Williams was not involved and it has no storyline connection to the original game . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Phantasmagoria is an interactive movie point @-@ and @-@ click adventure game which features live @-@ action actors and footage , both during cinematic scenes between the gameplay and within the three @-@ dimensional rendered environments of the game itself . The game was made when interactive movie games were at the peak of their popularity , with the release of such popular computer games as Wing Commander III and Under a Killing Moon . A single @-@ player game , the player controls protagonist Adrienne Delaney , who is always on the screen . The player can click certain areas of the screen to control her movements or make her explore specific places and objects . The camera angles or rooms change depending on where the player moves Adrienne . The game includes only four mouse commands : look ( which changes to " talk to " when selecting a person ) , pick up item , use item , and walk . The mouse cursor is always an arrow , which is different from most earlier Sierra On @-@ Line games in which the cursor could be changed into different functions ( like walk , hand , and eye ) by clicking the right mouse button . The cursor turns red when it passes over an action where the user can click to perform an action . Once the action has been completed , the cursor will not turn red again . Objects in the game can be picked up by clicking on them or interacting with them in a film sequence , after which the item automatically goes into the inventory . If an object is small enough that it can be easily missed , a pulsing glow occasionally surrounds it to draw attention to it . 
 The user interface features on a screen surrounded by a stone border , with buttons and eight inventory slots along the bottom . Adrienne can only hold eight items at once , and each black slot contains an image of the item , which the user can click on to retrieve or use within the game . In the middle of the inventory slots is a " P " button that brings up an options screen , allowing the player to save or restore games , change the game screen to full- or half @-@ size , control the volume , or switch between a censored and uncensored version of the game , which determines how much graphic content is shown . A chapter gauge on this screen conveys how much progress remains in a given chapter . A fast @-@ forward button , located above the options button , allows the user to skip past cinematic scenes . On the left side of the interface is a red skull button , which the user can click to receive hints . On the right side is a red button with a pictured of a closed eye , which the user can click @-@ and @-@ drag an inventory item onto to open the eye and look at an item . This leads to a close @-@ up photo of the item , which can be turned in multiple directions . 
 Game designer Roberta Williams , co @-@ founder of Sierra On @-@ Line , deliberately made the Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple , unobtrusive , and intuitive so it would be more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers . The game is focused more around the story and the frightening atmosphere , rather than on a difficult gaming experience , and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy , logical , and straightforward . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Successful mystery novelist Adrienne Delaney ( Victoria Morsell ) and her photographer husband Don Gordon ( David Homb ) have just purchased a remote mansion off the coast of a small New England island previously owned by a famous 19th @-@ century magician , Zoltan " Carno " <unk> ( Robert Miano ) , who had five wives who all died mysteriously . Hoping to find an inspiration for her next novel , Adrienne begins having nightmares immediately upon moving into her new home , but is comforted by the loving and supportive Don . Adrienne explores the estate , making mysterious discoveries like strange music , warnings written on her computer , and ominous messages from a fortune @-@ teller automaton . Unbeknownst to the happy couple , Carno had practiced black magic when he previously lived in the mansion and summoned an evil demon , which possessed him and caused him to murder his wives . 
 During her exploration of the grounds , Adrienne finds a secret chapel hidden behind a bricked off fireplace . After opening a locked box atop an altar , Adrienne unknowingly releases Carno 's demon , which promptly possesses Don . Don starts acting menacing and aggressively toward Adrienne , becoming progressively worse as time passes , culminating in a controversial scene in which he rapes Adrienne . Eventually , Adrienne meets Harriet Hockaday ( V. Joy Lee ) , a superstitious vagrant , and her strong but dim @-@ witted son , Cyrus ( Steven W. Bailey ) , who are secretly living in a barn on the estate . After Adrienne agrees to let them stay , they volunteer to them to help around the mansion . When a technician named Mike ( Carl <unk> ) visits the mansion to install the phone , Don screams at him in a jealous rage , warning him to stay away from his wife , much to Adrienne 's horror . Later , unbeknownst to Adrienne , Don bludgeons Mike to death . 
 While the local townspeople believe all Carno 's wives died of natural causes or accidentally , Adrienne learns through a series of visions that he murdered them in grotesque distortions of their personalities . <unk> ( Christine Armond ) , who avoided Zoltan 's abuse by <unk> herself in her greenhouse , is stabbed with gardening tools and suffocated with mulch . Victoria ( Holley Chant ) , an alcoholic , is killed when Zoltan impales her eye with a wine bottle during an argument . An overly talkative third wife , Leonora ( Dana Moody ) , has her mouth gagged and her neck contorted in a torture device . Finally , the food @-@ loving Regina ( Wanda Smith ) is force @-@ fed animal entrails through a funnel until she chokes to death . Harriet performs a séance for Adrienne , revealing in the form of a green ectoplasm the spirit of Carno before he had been possessed . He reveals that the previously contained evil spirit has been released , and urges Adrienne to trap it once again . 
 Adrienne visits the nearly 110 @-@ year @-@ old Malcolm <unk> ( Douglas Seale ) , who had been Carno 's apprentice as a young boy . Malcolm reveals that Carno met his demise after his last wife , Marie ( Traci Clauson ) discovered he was a murderer . Marie conspired with her lover , Gaston ( Jeff Rector ) , to kill Carno by sabotaging the equipment for his most infamous and dangerous <unk> trick , in which Carno dons a burning hood and escapes from bonds on a throne equipped with an overhead pendulous axe . The sabotage leaves Carno horribly burned and disfigured , but he survives and viciously attacks Marie and Gaston . After killing Marie by beheading her with the same pendulous throne , Carno is killed by Gaston just before he succumbs to his own wounds . Malcolm tells Adrienne about a ritual that can eradicate the demon . 
 Meanwhile , Harriet , fearing for her safety , decides to leave with Cyrus as Don becomes more abusive and erratic . The next day , Adrienne is attacked by Don , who is now completely insane and dressed like Carno . Adrienne scars Don 's face with acid from his darkroom and then flees , discovering the corpses of Mike , Harriet and Cyrus hidden throughout the mansion . Don captures Adrienne and straps her into the pendulous throne , but she distracts him long enough to free herself from the throne and trigger the pendulum , which impales and kills Don . His death unleashes the demon , a giant and murderous monster that pursues Adrienne through the mansion . She escapes long enough to perform a ritual that traps the demon once again . The game ends with Adrienne walking out of the mansion in a state of near @-@ catatonia with a seemingly thousand yard stare .

 Phantasmagoria was a radically different game for Williams , who was best known for designing the family @-@ friendly King 's Quest fantasy adventure game series . Williams said she did not want to get " typecast " to a particular genre and wanted to " stretch my creative muscle , " adding : " I felt I had more to offer than fairy stories . I wanted to explore games with a lot of substance and deep emotions . " Although Phantasmagoria was her first horror game , Williams had previously created suspenseful murder and crimes stories in her earlier mystery games , Mystery House and the Laura Bow series . Williams was a fan of the horror genre , although she did not watch many horror films as a child due to a traumatic experience watching Horrors of the Black Museum ( 1959 ) at age four . She began watching them again as a teen , and particularly enjoyed such films as Halloween ( 1978 ) , and movies based on Stephen King novels , like Carrie and The Shining ( 1980 ) . Williams cited the works of King and Edgar Allan Poe as inspirations behind Phantasmagoria . She felt the horror genre had not yet been properly explored in computer games yet , and that most attempts were just " a lot of hack and slash ( where ) the whole point seems to be to kill everyone and blow them away " . 
 Williams had wanted to do a make a horror game for eight years prior to Phantasmagoria , and had started to design a few , but none came to fruition . She felt the computer game industry and software technology had not yet reached the point where an effective and frightening computer game could be made . As a result , she decided to wait until CD @-@ ROMs were faster and could handle real actors , which she believed was crucial for a horror game because she felt the player had to be able to empathize with the character to fear for them . Williams had been considering several horror story ideas for years before making the game . In one , the heroine answers a magician 's advertisement for an assistant and gets the job , but the magician turns out to be insane . Another was set in the past , with the female protagonist getting involved in the supernatural life of a magician character . That idea evolved into a woman being married to a man who is drawn to a bizarre house that previously belonged to illusionists and is haunted by ghosts . The final story as it appears in the game is in a contemporary setting , but combines elements common in modern fiction with those of 19th century literature and classic horror films of the 1950s . 
 Phantasmagoria was the first Sierra On @-@ Line game script to be written like a film screenplay . Williams was working on King 's Quest VII simultaneously as she was writing the Phantasmagoria script . Williams found it stressful working on two major games at once and said she had " some difficulty keeping both games in my head " , but felt each received her undivided attention during the most crucial times in their respective developments . Even during the writing stage , Williams was under pressure to ensure Phantasmagoria was a commercial success for Sierra . She also faced concerns from her husband Ken Williams , the company president and co @-@ founder of Sierra , who wanted the company to focus more on lower @-@ cost , combat @-@ oriented animated games , and was also concerned about the level of violence in the Phantasmagoria . Williams said she knew the rape scene in particular would be controversial , but she felt it was essential to the plot because it was a turning point that made Adrienne realize something was deeply wrong with Don . She felt the rest of the story " would make no sense " without the scene , but also knew there was a chance it would be cut from the game before production ended . 
 The script about 550 pages long when completed , about four times the size of an average Hollywood screenplay . The script included another 100 pages of storyboards , representing a total of 800 scenes . In preparation for writing it , Williams spent six months watching horror films and reading horror novels , as well as books about how to write horror novels and screenplays . She also asked people she knew socially to tell her scary stories so she could identify the elements of fear . Williams immersed herself so deeply into the genre that she began having nightmares and had to scale back her reading . Williams also spent about six months researching historical aspects of the story before the writing process . Williams had a history of using female protagonists in her games , like the Laura Bow series and some of the King 's Quest games . She said having a female lead in Phantasmagoria was not a ploy to attract female gamers , but rather felt like the correct choice for the game . Williams said her own personality was a partial inspiration for the protagonist Adrienne , although it was not purposeful : " I think it just kind of naturally worked out that way . " 
 Andy Hoyos , the game 's art director and a horror aficionado , participated in brainstorming sessions and discussions with Williams during the writing stage . He conceived the ideas for most of the death scenes , and tried to make each one different and original with what he called " fresh approaches to murder " . Williams wanted to include more scenes with Adrienne and Don as a happy , normal couple , so that Don 's transformation to evil would be more impactful . However , she was unable to do so to maintain the correct pacing for the gameplay . Williams wrote Phantasmagoria with the mass market in mind , targeting casual gamers as well as die @-@ hard computer game fans . To that end , she wrote the game in short chapters to break the game into smaller , easier @-@ to @-@ play sections . Her targeted demographic for the game was ages 16 and older . Williams chose the title " Phantasmagoria " after reading the word in a reference book about the history of magic and magicians . The term refers to a 17th @-@ century theatrical horror show in which " spirits of the dead " were revealed in a darkened theater by use of a modified magic lantern . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Andy Hoyos was the art director for Phantasmagoria , and Kim White , Brandee <unk> and Brian Judy were among the computer artists . It was the first computer game <unk> worked on . Mark Hood , a veteran Sierra programmer , and Mark Seibert served as Phantasmagoria project managers . Seibert called managing the project " much more of a technical and managerial problem @-@ solving job than I ever envisioned " . Unlike previous Sierra games , it also involved managing a great deal of outside resources , such as keeping the studio and outside art contractors on schedule . The game 's three @-@ dimensional graphics were among the first rendered on Silicon Graphics software . In creating the look of the game , Hoyos drew particular inspiration from the films of Tim Burton , and he particularly tried to emulate the lighting , sets and " imaginative edge " of Batman ( 1989 ) . The films Alien ( 1979 ) and Hellraiser ( 1987 ) were additional influences . Phantasmagoria was designed using the 3 @-@ D software package Alias . Hoyos started by designing the rooms , then created the furniture , and added textures and lighting . Once complete , the computer rendered a final image of each room , which became the backgrounds for the game . While most computer games at the time had between 80 and 100 background pictures , Phantasmagoria had more than 1 @,@ 000 . 
 The game developers realized early during development that the game could not be completed entirely in @-@ house due to the large scope of the project , and required working with Hollywood agencies , actors and special effects houses , among others . This added further complexity to the game 's development and design . Gerald B. Wolfe , the game 's director of photography , spoke to the artists about how to set up the camera angles during filming to best accommodate the design of the rooms . Mannequins created in the computer substituted as stand @-@ ins for the actors to help Wolfe position the shots . Most of the artists had never created computer @-@ generated backgrounds for video @-@ captured characters , and found it to be a challenging process . Seibert said bridging the gap between Hollywood and the software world was difficult at first , but after about four weeks of shooting , the two sides had " come to a common language and had a greater understanding of the process " . Hoyos said the biggest difficulty in designing the look of the game was creating a definitive scale for the environment , and ensuring the objects and environment would eventually be compatible with human characters and maintain realism . 
 Once the filming was completed , more than 20 two @-@ hour Beta SP video tapes of footage that had to be edited down to fit the actions of the game . The programming included editing the original video footage , and mixing the rendered images of doors , drawers , chairs and other objects into the footage frame @-@ by @-@ frame , which was necessary for more than 100 scenes . The game required more polishing and fine @-@ tuning than most games of its time due to the large number of video components , and the programmers had to determine the desired frame rate , data transfer rate and desired resolution of the video elements . Another challenge for the game was CD resource management . Since many of the scenes in the game could be repeated in multiple chapters , some pieces of the code were written onto several different CDs to reduce the number of times the player had to swap discs , an unusual practice for computer games at the time . The programmers attempted to minimize the number of times a disc had to be swapped in the middle of a chapter . The final game was on seven discs , a large amount for a computer game , and more than the four or five discs originally expected during one point in the development . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Twenty @-@ five professional actors were cast in Phantasmagoria . Roberta Williams watched the audition tapes of all the roles , and was involved with Mark Seibert in picking the actors . The only actor that Siebert chose without Williams ' input was Victoria Morsell as the protagonist , Adrienne Delaney . Williams had watched other audition tapes for the part and did not find the right choice . While she was on vacation , Seibert watched Morsell 's audition and immediately selected her for the part . Williams was initially concerned that she was not involved in the decision , but later came to agree that Morsell was the correct choice . Morsell mostly had television experience , but had also previously worked in film and theater roles . She had to work 10 to 12 hours a day , six days a week , for three months to capture all her character 's actions and movements . Morsell said appreciated that her character was intelligent and not a typical horror film heroine , saying : " She doesn 't do incredibly stupid things . You don 't see her screaming in her underwear . The character isn 't about decoration . She 's a very real person . " David Homb portrayed Adrienne 's husband , Don Gordon . He had previously worked in television , theater , and had leading roles in 17 films , but this marked his first time playing an antagonist . Homb compared acting in Phantasmagoria to working in an entirely new medium , and called it " one of the best experiences I 've ever had in the entire entertainment business " . Morsell and Homb , who were an onscreen couple , started dating in real life after filming . Robert Miano was cast as the villain Zoltan " Carno " <unk> . He had previously appeared in several films , including Serpico ( 1973 ) and Death Wish ( 1974 ) , as well as films by Phantasmagoria director Peter Maris . Unlike Homb , Miano primarily played antagonists throughout his career ; he estimated " 90 percent of the time , I play the bad guy . " 
 The comic relief roles of Harriet and Cyrus were played by V. Joy Lee and Steven W. Bailey , respectively . Lee had mostly done theater work the in Atlanta and Seattle areas , along with appearing in some industrial films and an episode of Northern Exposure . Bailey had been an actor in Seattle for about three years , doing mostly stage work , as well as some commercials , television episodes , independent films , and industrial films for the United States Navy . Bailey 's character had to taunt the cat with a stick several times in the game . An animal lover , Bailey objected to doing so at first , and only agreed after the animal handlers assure him it would not bother the cats . Malcolm was portrayed by veteran actor Douglas Seale , who had previously appeared in Amadeus ( 1984 ) and performed voice work , including the role of the Sultan in the animated film Aladdin ( 1992 ) . Stella Stevens , a stage actress who also appeared in such films as The Nutty Professor ( 1963 ) with Jerry Lewis , played the antiques store owner Lou Ann , while Geoff <unk> played Bob the realtor , and Carl <unk> played phone technician Mike . Traci Clauson portrayed Marie , Carno 's fifth and final wife . She had previously worked mostly in television , including shows like Baywatch , Evening Shade and Married ... with Children . <unk> the storekeeper was played by Hoke Howell , a film , television and theater actor who trained at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City , having appeared in films like Another 48 Hours ( 1990 ) and Far and Away ( 1992 ) , as well as shows like The Wonder Years and Remington Steele . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Phantasmagoria was Sierra 's first game to use live actors integrated with computer @-@ generated backgrounds . About 600 scenes were filmed for the game , with the average scene taking about an hour to shoot , while others were significantly longer or shorter . The total filming took about four months , 12 hours a day , shooting six days a week . More than 200 people were ultimately involved in the making of the game . A total of $ 800 @,@ 000 was originally budgeted for Phantasmagoria , but it ended up costing $ 4 @.@ 5 million . The budget issues caused some friction between Roberta and Ken Williams . It was the first game made in a new filming studio built by Sierra in Oakhurst , California , the same location as Sierra 's headquarters . It cost $ 1 @.@ 5 million to build , and was overseen by studio manager Bill Crow , who said , " Phantasmagoria essentially started with the design and creation of the studio " . Sierra also developed computerized tools specifically to manage the shooting process , including software to digitize the video into the computer . Some of the software was built as the game was being made and needs for new tools were being identified . 
 Sierra wanted the game to have Hollywood @-@ quality film sequences , so they sought a director with experience in the film industry . They hired Peter Maris , whose previous experience consisted mainly of action and drama films , although some of his earlier films were graphic horror movies . Maris and Roberta Williams collaborated a great deal from the beginning of the process , with Maris explaining what he wanted in each scene from a filmmaker 's perspective , and Williams explaining her desires from a game designer 's perspective . Maris set up the camera angles and worked with the actors , using three motion @-@ controlled cameras during the shooting . All filming was done entirely in front of a blue screen , and the digitized information was later loaded into the Silicon Graphics computers , which synchronize the relative motion of computer @-@ generated , three @-@ dimensional background art . Next , the live action and the backgrounds were composited using advanced techniques controlled by an <unk> system . The computer imaging components made Phantasmagoria a very different experience for Maris than his usual film industry work . Crow served as a production coordinator during filming , helping facilitate what happened on stage . He also directed the scenes that involved stunts or other special effects that required the coordination of animated sequences with live action . Cindy Jordan worked as the makeup artist . 
 The average filming day began at 6 a.m. with setting up the studio , with actors coming in at 7 a.m. or 7 : 30 a.m. for make @-@ up calls . An hour @-@ long pre @-@ production meeting would detail what would be shot that day to ensure all necessary backgrounds and props were ready . Shooting would begin around 8 a.m. and conclude at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. Williams had no experience working with actors and feared it would be difficult due to " huge Hollywood egos " , but she instead found the actors to be professional and hardworking . Due to the nature of filming for a computer game , certain short performances had to be filmed over and over separately , like Adrienne simply crossing a room . The blue screen meant actors had to watch their positions very closely , as they had no actual sets or props to interact with . Many of the actors , including Morsell , Lee and Bailey , had never done any blue screen acting before , and Miano had only done it once . Morsell in particular said she found it challenging because it was so physically constrictive . Such items as tables , chairs , doors or stairs that the actors appear to interact with are in fact constructed objects painted blue to match the blue screen , and were occasionally challenging for the actors to work with . During one scene , David Homb accidentally stood in such a way that his arm appeared to be going through the living room wall . 
 Morsell found it challenging to film a scene near the end of the game , in which Adrienne is pleading with Don while getting strapped into the chair with a guillotine overhead . Several different versions of the scene had to be filmed , and Morsell said it was difficult for her to work up the genuine emotion she needed take after take . The torture devices featured in the game were scale models made by local craftsmen . During one scene , the mansion roof starts to collapse , causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around the actors . To achieve this , the crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard , which had to fall in the correct sequence . They normally had two grips on set , but needed six for this scene , and Wolfe used friends who were visiting from out of town to help throw the props from ladders , boxes and scaffolding . In another scene , Adrienne crawls along a water pipe that breaks . To film the scene without damaging equipment , the crew built a giant plastic box with a plastic tray underneath for the shoot . Three hoses ran through the pipe so water would spray in multiple directions . At one point in the film , Carno lies in the hospital bed after having just survived a fire , his face wrapped in bandages with blood leaking through . During filming , Miano spontaneously sat up and started singing Al Jolson songs , making the crew laugh hysterically . 
 The chase scene at the end of the game , in which Don pursues Adrienne throughout the entire mansion , took a full week to film . Homb wore a prosthesis on his face to simulate wounds from Adrienne pouring acid on him . Only one prosthesis was available , and it was in such bad shape by the end of filming that Williams said " we were essentially holding it in place with the proverbial wire and bailing wax " . Several scenes in Phantasmagoria involved animals , including a Doberman Pinscher , two cats , a beagle and several rats . Sierra commissioned Dave <unk> and other Hollywood animal handlers from the company Worldwide Movie Animals to handle the animals . Two cats were required to portray Adrienne 's pet Spaz because the cats were temperamental and each would have moments when they would not perform . The Doberman Pinscher simply barked behind a fence during his scene , and was trained to bark on command using different hand signals . The scene with the rats simply involved them running along a wall in a basement , which they were trained with to do using food . Some objects were borrowed by a museum operated by the Fresno Flats Historical Society and used as props in the game . The society was thanked in the credits as a result . Ultimately , all of the scenes filmed for Phantasmagoria were used in the final game . While some were edited for length and pacing , none were cut altogether . 
 Despite a storyline running over a course of seven days , Adrienne wears the same wardrobe throughout the entire game : an orange shirt and black pants . Williams said this is because many of Adrienne 's actions throughout the game can be repeated by the player over and over , making it difficult to change her wardrobe without it becoming " a nightmare of shooting " . The only solutions she saw were to allow less decision @-@ making by the player , or to keep the flexibility intact but not allow any costume changes . Williams said she decided the latter option was ultimately better for the game . An orange shirt was chosen for the character because it was the best color to shoot against the blue screen . None of the characters wear blue , purple , gray or any shade of green similar to the blue screen for that same reason . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 For Phantasmagoria 's special effects , Sierra sought the professional effects house The Character Shop , headed by senior creature maker Rick Lazzarini . He said the game reminded him of working on one of his earliest movies , the slasher film The Slumber Party Massacre ( 1982 ) . The core special effects team for the game consisted of Lazzarini , Michael <unk> and Bill Zahn . Lazzarini said making Phantasmagoria was much more cooperative and faster process than in the film industry . Due to the tight filming schedule , most effects had to be done in one shot with no cuts , so there was less margin for error . They created the effects for all the death scenes in the game , which included creating assorted body prosthesis , burn makeup and what Lazzarini called " gallons of fake blood " , which was made of sugar , water and dye . 
 Adrienne 's head is split open by a swinging pendulum blade in one death scene , an effect that took several hours to set up . A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell 's head , with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it , and strings attached to either side so it could be pulled apart . The crew only had one head model , so they had to keep putting it back together and reuse it over and over for each take . After filming was completed , the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it . Morsell had to have her face covered in plaster when the model of her head was created , and she experienced some anxieties during the process , saying it felt " like being buried alive " . Robert Miano had similar feelings of anxiety when a model of his body was created , which was used in the game for a scene when Carno is set on fire . Miano had to sit on a chair for hours as the crew put plaster all of his body and face , during which he had to breathe through straws in his nostrils . 
 One scene involved a burning head , which was created by taking a cast of the actor 's face , head and body with a plaster , then placing soft rubber over the cast to simulate human flesh . It was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned . For burn effects placed on the body after the fire , the crew made a sculpture of the wounds , then mounted them onto rubber appliances , which were glued to the actor . For Harriet 's death scene , in which she is scalped and her brain is visible , makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee 's head and covered it with mortician 's wax to make it look bumpy . Another special effect involved a spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a séance . It was created from cellulose , water and green food coloring . It proved difficult to make , and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved . To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee 's mouth , an eight @-@ foot long hose was attached to the side of her face . Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through the hose to get it in , then during filming he spit it out . It took several shots before the take was successful , and it looked so funny during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Sierra composers Mark Seibert and Jay User created the musical score for Phantasmagoria , with Neal <unk> providing additional music . Most of the music is a mixture of real instruments with synthesized and sampled sounds , and unlike previous Sierra games , the score was recorded live , rather than created in the computer . Themes for the music ranged from rock and roll to opera . The composers observed the game and various scenes to prepare their score , trying to create an ambiance and identify spots to build the tension with music , creating stingers as needed . For cinematic scenes , they watched tape of them after the scenes were shot and composed the music afterward . This was a new process for Sierra and the computer game industry in general , but the same concept regularly followed in the film industry . 
 The opening theme of the game features a neo @-@ Gregorian chant , which was performed in studio by a 135 @-@ voice choir . Much of the underscore music that plays when the player is exploring the game , rather than during cinematic scenes , is based upon that opening scene . The composers made use of silence in many scenes , to build up tension for moments of a " pounce " effect , creating the effect with music that something is catching the listener . They deliberately saved the most intense music for the final chapter of Phantasmagoria , when the game becomes the most intense . During some chase scenes , drums and low strings are used in the score to simulate a heartbeat , which grows louder and louder during more dangerous moments .

 Phantasmagoria took more than two years develop . Sierra officials said it took so long because it was so different than anything that had been done before , in both the Hollywood or computer game industries , and the new challenges led to complexities . Roberta Williams said : " It took a full year just to get people to understand what I wanted to do . " The game experienced multiple delays before it was ultimately released . It was originally announced the game would be in stores by late 1993 or early 1994 , with Sierra announcing it would be released no later than the fall of 1994 . The game was previewed at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in June 1994 , where it was announced the release date has been pushed back to October 1994 and that the game would be made available on two discs , rather than the seven discs it eventually became . The shipping date was later changed again to Christmas 1994 , and then February 1995 , before Sierra announced it would be delayed yet again as the company continued to refine the technology of live @-@ action video . It was announced the game would be ready in June 1995 , but when Sierra organized road shows that month to market 18 of its new games , Phantasmagoria was not among them because it was not ready yet . 
 The release date was changed once more to August 3 , before it was finally released in stores on August 24 , 1995 , the same day that Microsoft 's operating system Windows 95 was released . Phantasmagoria was released first for Windows 95 , Windows 3 @.@ 1 and MS @-@ DOS , then for Macintosh computers in November 1995 . Sierra released a hint book at the same time as the game . Phantasmagoria was also ported to Sega Saturn and released on eight discs exclusively in Japan , where it was fully translated and dubbed into Japanese , and released in August 1997 by the Outrigger Corporation under the name Phantasm . In response to all the delays , Vince Broady , executive editor of the monthly publication Multimedia World , said Sierra may have been attempting to avoid mistakes from its release the previous year of Outpost , for which the company release a large amount of advertisements and reviews , but then over @-@ promoted and released before it was finished . Sierra spokeswoman Kathy Gillmore admitted that mistakes were made in marketing Outpost and Sierra had tried to fix them . The minimum system requirements were an IBM compatible 486 @-@ 25 , 8 megabytes of RAM , 5 megabytes hard disk space , SVGA ( 256 colors ) and a 2x CD @-@ ROM . It supported Sound Blaster @-@ compatible sound cards , and for MS @-@ DOS the game worked with a megahertz chip . It sold for as much as $ 80 in some stores , but typically sold for $ 69 @.@ 95 upon its first release . 
 Phantasmagoria was heavily advertised by Sierra in advance of its release , and the company touted it as its biggest game to date . It was Sierra 's first computer game targeted to an adult audience , and one of the first horror games from any company written specifically for adults . There was no legislated rating system for computer games in the United States in place , although one was being debated before the U.S. Senate at the time . But Sierra was among several major software companies who voluntarily supported the ratings system designed by the Entertainment Software Rating Board , which rated games so adults could make decisions about software purchases . Phantasmagoria was the first game to get an " M " rating for " mature " audiences , meaning intended for audiences 17 or older , and as a result it carried a content warning on the box that said " contains adult subject matter " . The game box prominently displayed this rating , as well as a warning on the back panel that the game contains adult subject matter inappropriate for children . It also encouraged parents to review the material before providing it to children and asked retailers not to sell it to minors . Phantasmagoria also received mature ratings in Germany and the United Kingdom . 
 The game itself includes a filter that players can activate with a password so that violent or sexually explicit content is censored . When the filter is in place , the screen blurs during the most violent sections , so the player can hear the action but cannot see it . Sierra officials believed it was the first CD @-@ ROM adventure game that self @-@ censored itself upon command . Sierra producer Mark Seibert said : " There are some pretty gruesome things , and we 're concerned about how that is going to impact parents who want to buy a good game with a good story line . " But Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the censoring option was " unlikely to stop any computer @-@ literate 10 @-@ year @-@ old " and by scrambling portions of the videos that might be considered offensive , " the censorship option actually makes the explicit scenes seem even worse than they really are " . 
 In October 1997 , the first chapter of Phantasmagoria was included in the Roberta Williams Anthology , a limited @-@ edition collection of 15 games created by Williams over 18 years . Phantasmagoria was made available for digital download on the website GOG.com starting in February 2010 for $ 9 @.@ 99 .

 Phantasmagoria quickly became the best @-@ selling game in the United States , and was Sierra 's best @-@ selling computer game to date . It grossed $ 12 million and sold 300 @,@ 000 units during its first weekend of release , and debuted at fourth in PC Data 's August 1995 list of top @-@ selling computer games for MS @-@ DOS and Windows , based on a survey of 21 national retail chains . It followed MechWarrior 2 , Microsoft Flight Simulator and Myst . By September it had reached number one on the list among computer games , and was ranked third in best @-@ selling overall computer software , following Windows 95 and Microsoft Plus ! InterAction , a magazine published by Sierra On @-@ Line , wrote : " Never before has a new product jumped to number one on the charts so quickly . " By the end of December It remained at number three among overall software , and number one among computer games , and by January it was estimated as many as 500 @,@ 000 copies had been sold . 
 Despite coming out in August , Phantasmagoria finished 1995 as the ninth best @-@ selling game of the year , according to an analysis by PC Data of sales by 42 retail chains . In January 1996 , Phantasmagoria was the fourth @-@ best seller among MS @-@ DOS and Windows games , behind Microsoft Flight Simulator , Myst and Command & Conquer , and it was number six among all computer software . By February 10 it was number five among MS @-@ DOS and Windows games , and by February 24 it was number 10 . It received a boost in June 1996 , possibly due to the pending release of its sequel Phantasmagoria : A Puzzle of Flesh , and jumped back up to seventh among best @-@ selling computer software programs , according to Computer Life magazine . One year after Phantasmagoria was released , it still remained in the best @-@ seller charts , and more than 1 million copies were sold , a high number for the time . It was Sierra 's first game to sell 1 million copies . 
 = = = Reviews = = = 
 Phantasmagoria received generally positive to mixed reviews . The violent content drew a great deal of attention , with Lee S. <unk> of Jefferies & Co . , a global investment bank that followed the computer game industry , wrote , " It 's probably one of the bloodiest games ever . " Vince Broady , executive editor of Multimedia World , said Sierra was smart to try to capture the adult market , which was looking for sophisticated games especially after the popularity of games such as The 7th Guest . Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle declared it the best game of the year , calling it a " masterwork " and " as close as it gets to a film you control " , although he said not everyone would appreciate it due to its violent content . Entertainment Weekly gave it a B + and called it " one of the surest signs yet of computer games approaching the quality level of the movies " . The review said it had some suspenseful and novel twists , but also some " horrific touches ( that ) seem a bit derivative , such as a Freddy Krueger @-@ like nightmare in which hands pull you through a bed " . Kim McDaniel of The Salt Lake Tribune called it " the most sophisticated computer game to date " and " a weird , wild , horrific ride that will make you jump at every turn , even if you aren 't normally faint @-@ of @-@ heart " . Although McDaniel said it might be easy for experienced gamers , she appreciated that it was more accessible for casual gamers than difficult games like The 7th Guest . 
 A Billboard magazine review said Phantasmagoria " lives up to the advanced billing " and " aims to unnerve and succeeds gruesomely with bloody special effects <unk> in trusty scare @-@ flick fashion with daubs of flesh and hints of sex " . USA Today writer Joe Wilson gave it three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars and called it well @-@ produced , visually appealing , frighteningly realistic and " a much @-@ needed change from normal fare " , although he said the plot did not start to become interesting until halfway through . Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the game was " an impressive work , a sophisticated mix of live action and a rich computer @-@ generated environment , coupled with a musical score that 's spooky without being overwhelming " . He also called the gameplay " elegant in its simplicity " . San Francisco Chronicle writer Laura Evenson called it unpredictable and addictive , comparing it to a good mystery novel . Ric Manning of the Gannett News Service wrote , " The graphics are terrific , but don 't play on a full stomach . " Steve La Rue of U @-@ T San Diego found the game " visually opulent and interesting " and " has dialogue a lot better than I expected , given the trite gothic novel plot " , but also said he had to adjust to the " gradual , contemplative pace " . Jack Warner of The Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution wrote : " It 's hackneyed , but the art is so good , the acting sufficiently convincing and the atmosphere brooding enough to keep you going " , although he said " precious little happens " in the first few discs . 
 Computer Gaming World writer <unk> Dembo called the storyline of a couple buying a haunted mansion " a cliché so familiar that it needs no explanation " , but said it still worked in a computer game because the player could directly experience it in that medium , rather than simply watching it in a film . Dembo also praised the game for featuring a female protagonist , though she said Adrienne was too much of an exaggeratedly feminine " girlie @-@ type girl " . Overall , Dembo said the game " achieved a new height of realism and beauty in a computer game " and was " an important technological leap , and represents a step forward for the whole industry " . Another Computer Gaming World review said <unk> " appears to deliver on its ambitious promises " and that although the puzzles are too simple for experienced gamers , the appeal of the game is exploring a setting that " would have had even the folks in Amityville making tracks " . Harley <unk> of the Austin American @-@ Statesman said some of the acting was " hilariously bad " and the storyline was predictable , but that the game keeps you engaged , the story draws you in and the controls were well executed . Fort Worth Star @-@ Telegram writer Andy Greiser said the game was a beautiful combination of live actors and computer @-@ built backgrounds , but said the action doesn 't start to pick up until the halfway point . In a mixed review , Phil LaRose of The Advocate praised the game for having a female protagonist and excellent special effects , and said it had gone further toward merging the realms of film and game than any other computer game . However , he said the game was too linear , with overly simple puzzles and a plotline with " so many recycled concepts in this game , players will feel like they 've seen it all before " . 
 Other reviews were more negative . GameSpot writer Jeff <unk> said the expensive budget and long production history " do not necessarily translate into high quality gaming " . He complimented the graphics and music , but called the game " generally unchallenging , the characters weak , the violence over @-@ the @-@ top , and the script just lame " . Mike Hall of the Albuquerque Journal compared Phantasmagoria to big @-@ budget films with multimillion @-@ dollar budgets and multiple production delays that ultimately failed , like Cleopatra and Waterworld . He said the graphics were beautiful , but the game ended too quickly , the plot was thin and the puzzles were too easy to solve . The Escapist writer Brendan Main said the game fell short of its ambition to change how gamers experienced horror media , and the juxtaposition of real @-@ life actors on settings that were " ordinary , pixilated fare " was " odd and unflattering " . A one @-@ star review in The Video Games Guide , published in 2013 , " now seems little more than a flawed , though ambitious , white elephant " . In a 2014 review , IGN writer Kosta Andreadis said the game 's special effects were still effective , and that Phantasmagoria wisely builds suspense and saves the violent content for the end of the game . But he said it was ultimate " less a bad game than a bad horror film " and said the execution , " although technically interesting , is extremely goofy , full of ludicrous situations , weird plot turns , bizarre dialogue , and dated costume choices " .

 Phantasmagoria the Golden Triad Award from Computer Game Review , and an Editor 's Choice Award from PC Gamer . It was nominated for Best Adventure / Role @-@ Playing Software in the annual Excellence in Software Awards competition , known in the gaming industry as " The <unk> " , which are among the most prestigious honors in software development . Additionally , it was named Best Adventure Game of the Year by Games Magazine , Game of the Month by Windows Magazine , and was one of three nominees for PC / Computing 's Game of the Year . 
 = = = Controversy = = = 
 Before Phantasmagoria was released , CompUSA , the nation 's largest discount computer retailer , notified Sierra it would not stock the game . The company did not comment on specific reasons for their decision except for a written statement from chief operating officer Hal Compton : " Software comes out all the time . Some we buy , some we don 't . This one we chose not to . " Analysts believed CompUSA objected to the realistic violence in the game . Lee S. <unk> of Jefferies & Co. said CompUSA 's decision probably would not harm overall sales of the game , and that it could in fact help it generate publicity . Likewise , Vincent Turzo of Jefferies & Co. said , " When you say you 're not going to carry something , of course the consumers rush to the stores to see what it 's all about . " Roberta Williams said of CompUSA 's announcement : " I 'm disappointed that they decided to make a stand with my product . " Some smaller retailers also decided not to stock Phantasmagoria , but others like Walmart continued to carry it . 
 In addition to the graphic gore and violence , the rape scene in Phantasmagoria drew particular attention and objections from the game 's critics . One major newspaper claimed Phantasmagoria " makes a game of sexual violence " . Multiple parents ' groups , religious organizations community action committees and special interest groups called for a boycott , and sent letters to the Sierra offices in droves voicing objections to the game . Phantasmagoria was banned from most retailers in Australia by decree of the government 's Office of Film and Literature Classification . The Roberta Williams Anthology collection was also banned in Australia because it featured a one @-@ chapter preview of the game . The governments of two other countries also banned Phantasmagoria . The game was spotlighted in U.S. Senate hearings debating regulation of content in the computer software <unk> and there was talk that it could re @-@ ignite the debate in Congress over whether to impose federally mandated ratings on computer software that stores would be required to enforce . 
 Sierra found that Williams tended to garner extremely favorable press , even as Phantasmagoria got negative press , so the company began having her direct the game in person . In response to the backlash , Williams said she believed computer games were subject to harsher standards than films and television , which she said often have more violent content than Phantasmagoria , in part because computer games are often regarded as children 's entertainment rather than for adults . Williams said Phantasmagoria was less excessively violent than games like Doom and Mortal Kombat , and that unlike those games , the Phantasmagoria is " the good guy ... not going around shooting up people " . Sierra spokeswoman Rebecca Buxton and Dennis Cloutier , the company 's vice president of sales , both expressed surprised at the reaction to the game because Sierra made strong efforts to warn viewers about the adult content in its marketing , box warnings and censoring options . Cloutier said the company was essentially " censoring ourselves " . Steven L. Kent of The Seattle Times said there were more violent games than Phantasmagoria , but that most video game violence appears in computer animations , and thus can be more easily overlooked than in a live @-@ action game , which elicits a stronger emotional response . 
 In April 1998 , three years after the game was released , the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System came under criticism for owning 435 @,@ 000 shares worth $ 9 million in Cendant , which by this point had purchased Sierra On @-@ Line , due to the violence in the Phantasmagoria and other Sierra games . Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell ; Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee ; Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad ; and Lamar Alexander , former governor of Tennessee ; all asked the system to sell its stock . McConnell was particularly critical of the rape scene . They suggested a link existed between recent student slayings in West Paducah , Kentucky , and Jonesboro , Arkansas , and the " increasingly violent world many American children enter when they sit down in front of a computer screen " . Pat Miller , executive secretary of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System , said the system wasn 't aware of Phantasmagoria or Sierra 's products , and that it invested in Cendant because it 's part of an index fund of the 500 best stocks in the country . Miller added that , if the retirement system finds a problem with Sierra On @-@ Line , it would ask Cendant to cease ownership in the company , and that the system would divest its stock if it refused . Miller said : " We 're not going to continue to invest in some company that does something that will be detrimental to our children . We know that our membership would not want us to do that . " The same letter was also sent to heads of teachers ' retirement systems in California , Ohio and Texas .

 The commercial success of Phantasmagoria had an immediate positive financial impact on Sierra On @-@ Line . Even before its release , the company 's stock rose in July 1995 , up $ 3 @.@ 875 to $ 30 @.@ 875 , which Vince Turzo of Jeffries & Co attributed in part due to anticipation of Phantasmagoria . Sierra 's stock continued to rise after it was released . The company closed on the NASDAQ stock market at $ 43 @.@ 25 on September 8 , 1995 , translating to a 73 percent gain in less than three months , which Turzo again attributed partially to Phantasmagoria 's success . For the quarter ending September 30 , 1995 , Sierra posted a profit of $ 3 @.@ 26 million , compared to a loss of $ 850 @,@ 000 in 1994 . This improvement exceeded expectations in analysts ' forecasts , and was thanks largely to Phantasmagoria sales . 
 Williams returned to work on the King 's Quest series after Phantasmagoria was completed . While happy with the game , she said she did not expect to make another horror game again , saying , " It 's not really my area " . Sierra used the same technology and Hollywood techniques from Phantasmagoria to make The Beast Within : A Gabriel Knight Mystery ( 1995 ) , another interactive movie adventure game . Williams later described Phantasmagoria as the game that best represented her career as a game designer . Due to its development delays , Phantasmagoria was released after other interactive movie games like Wing Commander III and Under a Killing Moon , so it did not receive as much credit for heralding that gaming subgenre as the other titles . Harley <unk> of the Austin American @-@ Statesman said by the time it was finally released , " computer games that incorporate video ( were ) becoming a common sight on the software store racks " . Sean Clark , a project leader at LucasArts , feared the success of Phantasmagoria would set a bad precedent that software companies would think they need huge budgets and lots of discs to have a successful game , rather than focusing on quality . 
 = = Sequel = = 
 A Phantasmagoria sequel , Phantasmagoria : A Puzzle of Flesh ( 1996 ) , was released by Sierra a year after the original . It was written and designed by Lorelei Shannon , Roberta Williams ' design partner on King 's Quest VII . Williams was not involved with it , and the game featured a very different tone and completely different characters , with no direct connection to the storyline of the first game . Shannon said the original game was a haunted house story in the style of a " late night creature feature " , while her game has more science @-@ fiction and fantasy horror elements , in the style of the works of Clive Barker and <unk> Lee . Roberta Williams said both she and her husband Ken enjoyed the sequel . A preview for A Puzzle of Flesh was included in the first CD of the original Phantasmagoria game . 
 Ken Williams had wanted Roberta to work on a Phantasmagoria sequel immediately after the success of the first game , but she could not do so due to her obligations to King 's Quest VIII . Ken Williams felt the sequel was less successful because gamers could sense the absence of Roberta 's style . " It 's as if a bestselling author had a book ghostwritten . Within a few pages , the fans would know they had been duped and feel disappointed , regardless of the quality of the work . " Ken Williams said a third game was not produced after A Puzzle of Flesh because of issues after Sierra was acquired by CUC International in 1996 . Distribution was handled by Davidson & Associates , another CUC company , which primarily sold educational software . Williams said the company was uncomfortable with the violent content in Phantasmagoria and did not attempt sell the sequel aggressively as Sierra would have . He also claimed Jan Davidson , the wife of Chairman and CEO Bob Davidson , personally did not like the game and " wanted it shut down " . Due to these sales challenges , Williams said " there was no reason to make a third <unk> . 
 Roberta Williams , however , said she was asked by Sierra to make a third Phantasmagoria game , and that she said she would consider it , but it was not ultimately made . Williams said : 
 Before I would even consider tackling a major project like that , though – and devoting a couple of years of my life to it – I would need a huge outpouring from all of those gamers out there that they would truly love to have another <unk> to play . If there is a big enough groundswell of support for another Phantasmagoria , and if Sierra hears it and begs me enough , I might consider it . 
 = Jack the Ripper = 
 Jack the Ripper is the best known name given to an unidentified serial killer generally believed to have been active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in 1888 . The name " Jack the Ripper " originated in a letter written by someone claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media . The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax , and may have been written by journalists in an attempt to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers ' circulation . The killer was called " the Whitechapel Murderer " as well as " Leather Apron " within the crime case files , as well as in contemporary journalistic accounts . 
 Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations . The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge . Rumours that the murders were connected intensified in September and October 1888 , and letters were received by media outlets and Scotland Yard from a writer or writers purporting to be the murderer . The " From Hell " letter received by George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee included half of a preserved human kidney , purportedly taken from one of the victims . The public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as " Jack the Ripper " , mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal character of the murders , and because of media treatment of the events . 
 Extensive newspaper coverage bestowed widespread and enduring international notoriety on the Ripper , and his legend solidified . A police investigation into a series of eleven brutal killings in Whitechapel up to 1891 was unable to connect all the killings conclusively to the murders of 1888 . Five victims — Mary Ann Nichols , Annie Chapman , Elizabeth Stride , Catherine Eddowes , and Mary Jane Kelly — are known as the " canonical five " and their murders between 31 August and 9 November 1888 are often considered the most likely to be linked . The murders were never solved , and the legends surrounding them became a combination of genuine historical research , folklore , and pseudohistory . The term " <unk> " was coined to describe the study and analysis of the Ripper cases . There are now over one hundred theories about the Ripper 's identity , and the murders have inspired many works of fiction . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the mid @-@ 19th century , Britain experienced an influx of Irish immigrants who swelled the populations of the major cities , including the East End of London . From 1882 , Jewish refugees from pogroms in Tsarist Russia and other areas of Eastern Europe emigrated into the same area . The parish of Whitechapel in London 's East End became increasingly overcrowded . Work and housing conditions worsened , and a significant economic underclass developed . Robbery , violence , and alcohol dependency were commonplace , and the endemic poverty drove many women to prostitution . In October 1888 , London 's Metropolitan Police Service estimated that there were 62 brothels and 1 @,@ 200 women working as prostitutes in Whitechapel . The economic problems were accompanied by a steady rise in social tensions . Between 1886 and 1889 , frequent demonstrations led to police intervention and public unrest , such as that of 13 November 1887 . Anti @-@ semitism , crime , nativism , racism , social disturbance , and severe deprivation fed public perceptions that Whitechapel was a notorious den of immorality . In 1888 , such perceptions were strengthened when a series of vicious and grotesque murders attributed to " Jack the Ripper " received unprecedented coverage in the media . 
 = = Murders = = 
 The large number of attacks against women in the East End during this time adds uncertainty to how many victims were killed by the same person . Eleven separate murders , stretching from 3 April 1888 to 13 February 1891 , were included in a London Metropolitan Police Service investigation and were known collectively in the police docket as the " Whitechapel murders " . Opinions vary as to whether these murders should be linked to the same culprit , but five of the eleven Whitechapel murders , known as the " canonical five " , are widely believed to be the work of Jack the Ripper . Most experts point to deep throat slashes , abdominal and genital @-@ area mutilation , removal of internal organs , and progressive facial mutilations as the distinctive features of the Ripper 's modus operandi . The first two cases in the Whitechapel murders file , those of Emma Elizabeth Smith and Martha Tabram , are not included in the canonical five . 
 Smith was robbed and sexually assaulted in Osborn Street , Whitechapel , on 3 April 1888 . A blunt object was inserted into her vagina , rupturing her peritoneum . She developed peritonitis and died the following day at London Hospital . She said that she had been attacked by two or three men , one of whom was a teenager . The attack was linked to the later murders by the press , but most authors attribute it to gang violence unrelated to the Ripper case . 
 Tabram was killed on 7 August 1888 ; she had suffered 39 stab wounds . The savagery of the murder , the lack of obvious motive , and the closeness of the location ( George Yard , Whitechapel ) and date to those of the later Ripper murders led police to link them . The attack differs from the canonical murders in that Tabram was stabbed rather than slashed at the throat and abdomen , and many experts today do not connect it with the later murders because of the difference in the wound pattern . 
 = = = Canonical five = = = 
 The canonical five Ripper victims are Mary Ann Nichols , Annie Chapman , Elizabeth Stride , Catherine Eddowes , and Mary Jane Kelly . 
 Nichols ' body was discovered at about 3 : 40 a.m. on Friday 31 August 1888 in Buck 's Row ( now Durward Street ) , Whitechapel . The throat was severed by two cuts , and the lower part of the abdomen was partly ripped open by a deep , jagged wound . Several other incisions on the abdomen were caused by the same knife . 
 Chapman 's body was discovered at about 6 a.m. on Saturday 8 September 1888 near a doorway in the back yard of 29 Hanbury Street , Spitalfields . As in the case of Mary Ann Nichols , the throat was severed by two cuts . The abdomen was slashed entirely open , and it was later discovered that the uterus had been removed . At the inquest , one witness described seeing Chapman at about 5 : 30 a.m. with a dark @-@ haired man of " shabby @-@ genteel " appearance . 
 Stride and Eddowes were killed in the early morning of Sunday 30 September 1888 . Stride 's body was discovered at about 1 a.m. in <unk> 's Yard , off Berner Street ( now Henriques Street ) in Whitechapel . The cause of death was one clear @-@ cut incision which severed the main artery on the left side of the neck . The absence of mutilations to the abdomen has led to uncertainty about whether Stride 's murder should be attributed to the Ripper or whether he was interrupted during the attack . Witnesses thought that they saw Stride with a man earlier that night but gave differing descriptions : some said that her companion was fair , others dark ; some said that he was shabbily dressed , others well @-@ dressed . 
 Eddowes ' body was found in Mitre Square in the City of London , three @-@ quarters of an hour after Stride 's . The throat was severed and the abdomen was ripped open by a long , deep , jagged wound . The left kidney and the major part of the uterus had been removed . A local man named Joseph Lawende had passed through the square with two friends shortly before the murder , and he described seeing a fair @-@ haired man of shabby appearance with a woman who may have been Eddowes . His companions were unable to confirm his description . Eddowes ' and Stride 's murders were later called the " double event " . Part of Eddowes ' bloodied apron was found at the entrance to a tenement in Goulston Street , Whitechapel . Some writing on the wall above the apron piece became known as the Goulston Street graffito and seemed to implicate a Jew or Jews , but it was unclear whether the graffito was written by the murderer as he dropped the apron piece , or was merely incidental . Such graffiti were commonplace in Whitechapel . Police Commissioner Charles Warren feared that the graffito might spark anti @-@ semitic riots and ordered it washed away before dawn . 
 Kelly 's mutilated and disemboweled body was discovered lying on the bed in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller 's Court , off Dorset Street , Spitalfields , at 10 : 45 a.m. on Friday 9 November 1888 . The throat had been severed down to the spine , and the abdomen almost emptied of its organs . The heart was missing . 
 The canonical five murders were perpetrated at night , on or close to a weekend , either at the end of a month or a week ( or so ) after . The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded , except for that of Stride , whose attacker may have been interrupted . Nichols was not missing any organs ; Chapman 's uterus was taken ; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed and her face mutilated ; and Kelly 's body was eviscerated and her face hacked away , though only her heart was missing from the crime scene . 
 Historically , the belief that these five crimes were committed by the same man is derived from contemporary documents that link them together to the exclusion of others . In 1894 , Sir Melville Macnaghten , Assistant Chief Constable of the Metropolitan Police Service and Head of the Criminal Investigation Department ( CID ) , wrote a report that stated : " the Whitechapel murderer had 5 victims — & 5 victims only " . Similarly , the canonical five victims were linked together in a letter written by police surgeon Thomas Bond to Robert Anderson , head of the London CID , on 10 November 1888 . Some researchers have posited that some of the murders were undoubtedly the work of a single killer but an unknown larger number of killers acting independently were responsible for the others . Authors Stewart P. Evans and Donald Rumbelow argue that the canonical five is a " Ripper myth " and that three cases ( Nichols , Chapman , and Eddowes ) can be definitely linked but there is less certainty over Stride and Kelly . Conversely , others suppose that the six murders between Tabram and Kelly were the work of a single killer . Dr Percy Clark , assistant to the examining pathologist George Bagster Phillips , linked only three of the murders and thought that the others were perpetrated by " weak @-@ minded individual [ s ] ... induced to emulate the crime " . Macnaghten did not join the police force until the year after the murders , and his memorandum contains serious factual errors about possible suspects . 
 = = = Later Whitechapel murders = = = 
 Kelly is generally considered to be the Ripper 's final victim , and it is assumed that the crimes ended because of the culprit 's death , imprisonment , institutionalisation , or emigration . The Whitechapel murders file does , however , detail another four murders that happened after the canonical five : those of Rose Mylett , Alice McKenzie , the Pinchin Street torso , and Frances Coles . 
 Mylett was found strangled in Clarke 's Yard , High Street , Poplar on 20 December 1888 . There was no sign of a struggle , and the police believed that she had accidentally hanged herself on her collar while in a drunken stupor or committed suicide . Nevertheless , the inquest jury returned a verdict of murder . 
 McKenzie was killed on 17 July 1889 by severance of the left carotid artery . Several minor bruises and cuts were found on the body , discovered in Castle Alley , Whitechapel . One of the examining pathologists , Thomas Bond , believed this to be a Ripper murder , though his colleague George Bagster Phillips , who had examined the bodies of three previous victims , disagreed . Later writers are also divided between those who think that her murderer copied the Ripper 's modus operandi to deflect suspicion from himself , and those who ascribe it to the Ripper . 
 " The Pinchin Street torso " was a headless and legless torso of an unidentified woman found under a railway arch in Pinchin Street , Whitechapel , on 10 September 1889 . It seems probable that the murder was committed elsewhere and that parts of the dismembered body were dispersed for disposal . 
 Coles was killed on 13 February 1891 under a railway arch at Swallow Gardens , Whitechapel . Her throat was cut but the body was not mutilated . James Thomas Sadler was seen earlier with her and was arrested by the police , charged with her murder , and briefly thought to be the Ripper . He was , however , discharged from court for lack of evidence on 3 March 1891 . 
 = = = Other alleged victims = = = 
 In addition to the eleven Whitechapel murders , commentators have linked other attacks to the Ripper . In the case of " Fairy Fay " , it is unclear whether the attack was real or fabricated as a part of Ripper lore . " Fairy Fay " was a nickname given to a victim allegedly found on 26 December 1887 " after a stake had been thrust through her abdomen " , but there were no recorded murders in Whitechapel at or around Christmas 1887 . " Fairy Fay " seems to have been created through a confused press report of the murder of Emma Elizabeth Smith , who had a stick or other blunt object shoved into her abdomen . Most authors agree that the victim " Fairy Fay " never existed . 
 Annie Millwood was admitted to Whitechapel workhouse infirmary with stab wounds in the legs and lower torso on 25 February 1888 . She was discharged but died from apparently natural causes aged 38 on 31 March 1888 . She was later postulated as the Ripper 's first victim , but the attack cannot be linked definitely . Another supposed early victim was Ada Wilson , who reportedly survived being stabbed twice in the neck on 28 March 1888 . Annie Farmer resided at the same lodging house as Martha Tabram and reported an attack on 21 November 1888 . She had a superficial cut on her throat , but it was possibly self @-@ inflicted . 
 " The Whitehall Mystery " was a term coined for the discovery of a headless torso of a woman on 2 October 1888 in the basement of the new Metropolitan Police headquarters being built in Whitehall . An arm belonging to the body was previously discovered floating in the river Thames near Pimlico , and one of the legs was subsequently discovered buried near where the torso was found . The other limbs and head were never recovered and the body was never identified . The mutilations were similar to those in the Pinchin Street case , where the legs and head were severed but not the arms . The Whitehall Mystery and the Pinchin Street case may have been part of a series of murders called the " Thames Mysteries " , committed by a single serial killer dubbed the " Torso killer " . It is debatable whether Jack the Ripper and the " Torso killer " were the same person or separate serial killers active in the same area . The modus operandi of the Torso killer differed from that of the Ripper , and police at the time discounted any connection between the two . Elizabeth Jackson was a prostitute whose various body parts were collected from the river Thames over a three @-@ week period in June 1889 . She may have been another victim of the " Torso killer " . 
 John Gill , a seven @-@ year @-@ old boy , was found murdered in Manningham , Bradford , on 29 December 1888 . His legs had been severed , his abdomen opened , his intestines drawn out , and his heart and one ear removed . The similarities with the murder of Mary Kelly led to press speculation that the Ripper had killed the boy . The boy 's employer , milkman William Barrett , was twice arrested for the murder on circumstantial evidence but was released . No @-@ one else was ever prosecuted . 
 Carrie Brown ( nicknamed " Shakespeare " , reportedly for quoting Shakespeare 's sonnets ) was strangled with clothing and then mutilated with a knife on 24 April 1891 in New York City . Her body was found with a large tear through her groin area and superficial cuts on her legs and back . No organs were removed from the scene , though an ovary was found upon the bed , either purposely removed or unintentionally dislodged . At the time , the murder was compared to those in Whitechapel , though the Metropolitan Police eventually ruled out any connection . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 The surviving police files on the Whitechapel murders allow a detailed view of investigative procedure in the Victorian era . A large team of policemen conducted house @-@ to @-@ house inquiries throughout Whitechapel . Forensic material was collected and examined . Suspects were identified , traced , and either examined more closely or eliminated from the inquiry . Police work follows the same pattern today . More than 2 @,@ 000 people were interviewed , " upwards of 300 " people were investigated , and 80 people were detained . 
 The investigation was initially conducted by the Metropolitan Police Whitechapel ( H ) Division Criminal Investigation Department ( CID ) headed by Detective Inspector Edmund Reid . After the murder of Nichols , Detective Inspectors Frederick Abberline , Henry Moore , and Walter Andrews were sent from Central Office at Scotland Yard to assist . The City of London Police were involved under Detective Inspector James McWilliam after the Eddowes murder , which occurred within the City of London . However , overall direction of the murder enquiries was hampered by the fact that the newly appointed head of the CID Robert Anderson was on leave in Switzerland between 7 September and 6 October , during the time when Chapman , Stride , and Eddowes were killed . This prompted Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Charles Warren to appoint Chief Inspector Donald Swanson to coordinate the enquiry from Scotland Yard . 
 A group of volunteer citizens in London 's East End called the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee patrolled the streets looking for suspicious characters , partly because of dissatisfaction with the police effort . They petitioned the government to raise a reward for information about the killer , and hired private detectives to question witnesses independently . 
 Butchers , slaughterers , surgeons , and physicians were suspected because of the manner of the mutilations . A surviving note from Major Henry Smith , Acting Commissioner of the City Police , indicates that the alibis were investigated of local butchers and slaughterers , with the result that they were eliminated from the inquiry . A report from Inspector Swanson to the Home Office confirms that 76 butchers and slaughterers were visited , and that the inquiry encompassed all their employees for the previous six months . Some contemporary figures , including Queen Victoria , thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle boats that plied between London and mainland Europe . Whitechapel was close to the London Docks , and usually such boats docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday . The cattle boats were examined but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat 's movements and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out . 
 = = = Criminal profiling = = = 
 At the end of October , Robert Anderson asked police surgeon Thomas Bond to give his opinion on the extent of the murderer 's surgical skill and knowledge . The opinion offered by Bond on the character of the " Whitechapel murderer " is the earliest surviving offender profile . Bond 's assessment was based on his own examination of the most extensively mutilated victim and the post mortem notes from the four previous canonical murders . He wrote : 
 All five murders no doubt were committed by the same hand . In the first four the throats appear to have been cut from left to right , in the last case owing to the extensive mutilation it is impossible to say in what direction the fatal cut was made , but arterial blood was found on the wall in splashes close to where the woman 's head must have been lying . 
 All the circumstances surrounding the murders lead me to form the opinion that the women must have been lying down when murdered and in every case the throat was first cut . 
 Bond was strongly opposed to the idea that the murderer possessed any kind of scientific or anatomical knowledge , or even " the technical knowledge of a butcher or horse slaughterer " . In his opinion , the killer must have been a man of solitary habits , subject to " periodical attacks of homicidal and erotic mania " , with the character of the mutilations possibly indicating " <unk> " . Bond also stated that " the homicidal impulse may have developed from a revengeful or brooding condition of the mind , or that religious mania may have been the original disease but I do not think either hypothesis is likely " . 
 There is no evidence of any sexual activity with any of the victims , yet psychologists suppose that the penetration of the victims with a knife and " leaving them on display in sexually degrading positions with the wounds exposed " indicates that the perpetrator derived sexual pleasure from the attacks . This view is challenged by others who dismiss such hypotheses as insupportable supposition . 
 = = Suspects = = 
 The concentration of the killings around weekends and public holidays and within a few streets of each other has indicated to many that the Ripper was in regular employment and lived locally . Others have thought that the killer was an educated upper @-@ class man , possibly a doctor or an aristocrat who ventured into Whitechapel from a more well @-@ to @-@ do area . Such theories draw on cultural perceptions such as fear of the medical profession , mistrust of modern science , or the exploitation of the poor by the rich . Suspects proposed years after the murders include virtually anyone remotely connected to the case by contemporary documents , as well as many famous names who were never considered in the police investigation . Everyone alive at the time is now dead , and modern authors are free to accuse anyone " without any need for any supporting historical evidence " . Suspects named in contemporary police documents include three in Sir Melville Macnaghten 's 1894 memorandum , but the evidence against them is circumstantial at best . 
 There are many and varied theories about the identity and profession of Jack the Ripper , but authorities are not agreed upon any of them , and the number of named suspects reaches over one hundred . 
 = = Letters = = 
 Over the course of the Ripper murders , the police , newspapers , and others received hundreds of letters regarding the case . Some were well @-@ intentioned offers of advice for catching the killer , but the vast majority were useless . 
 Hundreds of letters claimed to have been written by the killer himself , and three of these in particular are prominent : the " Dear Boss " letter , the " Saucy Jacky " postcard and the " From Hell " letter . 
 The " Dear Boss " letter , dated 25 September , was postmarked 27 September 1888 . It was received that day by the Central News Agency , and was forwarded to Scotland Yard on 29 September . Initially it was considered a hoax , but when Eddowes was found three days after the letter 's postmark with one ear partially cut off , the letter 's promise to " clip the <unk> ( sic ) ears off " gained attention . However , Eddowes ' ear appears to have been nicked by the killer incidentally during his attack , and the letter writer 's threat to send the ears to the police was never carried out . The name " Jack the Ripper " was first used in this letter by the signatory and gained worldwide notoriety after its publication . Most of the letters that followed copied this letter 's tone . Some sources claim that another letter dated 17 September 1888 was the first to use the name " Jack the Ripper " , but most experts believe that this was a fake inserted into police records in the 20th century . 
 The " Saucy Jacky " postcard was postmarked 1 October 1888 and was received the same day by the Central News Agency . The handwriting was similar to the " Dear Boss " letter . It mentions that two victims were killed very close to one another : " double event this time " , which was thought to refer to the murders of Stride and Eddowes . It has been argued that the letter was mailed before the murders were publicised , making it unlikely that a crank would have such knowledge of the crime , but it was postmarked more than 24 hours after the killings took place , long after details were known and being published by journalists and talked about by residents of the area . 
 The " From Hell " letter was received by George Lusk , leader of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee , on 16 October 1888 . The handwriting and style is unlike that of the " Dear Boss " letter and " Saucy Jacky " postcard . The letter came with a small box in which Lusk discovered half of a kidney , preserved in " spirits of wine " ( ethanol ) . Eddowes ' left kidney had been removed by the killer . The writer claimed that he " fried and ate " the missing kidney half . There is disagreement over the kidney ; some contend that it belonged to Eddowes , while others argue that it was nothing more than a macabre practical joke . The kidney was examined by Dr Thomas Openshaw of the London Hospital , who determined that it was human and from the left side , but ( contrary to false newspaper reports ) he could not determine any other biological characteristics . Openshaw subsequently also received a letter signed " Jack the Ripper " . 
 Scotland Yard published facsimiles of the " Dear Boss " letter and the postcard on 3 October , in the ultimately vain hope that someone would recognise the handwriting . Charles Warren explained in a letter to Godfrey Lushington , Permanent Under @-@ Secretary of State for the Home Department : " I think the whole thing a hoax but of course we are bound to try & ascertain the writer in any case . " On 7 October 1888 , George R. Sims in the Sunday newspaper Referee implied scathingly that the letter was written by a journalist " to hurl the circulation of a newspaper sky high " . Police officials later claimed to have identified a specific journalist as the author of both the " Dear Boss " letter and the postcard . The journalist was identified as Tom Bullen in a letter from Chief Inspector John <unk> to George R. Sims dated 23 September 1913 . A journalist called Fred Best reportedly confessed in 1931 that he and a colleague at The Star had written the letters signed " Jack the Ripper " to heighten interest in the murders and " keep the business alive " . 
 = = Media = = 
 The Ripper murders mark an important watershed in the treatment of crime by journalists . Jack the Ripper was not the first serial killer , but his case was the first to create a worldwide media frenzy . Tax reforms in the 1850s had enabled the publication of inexpensive newspapers with wider circulation . These mushroomed later in the Victorian era to include mass @-@ circulation newspapers as cheap as a halfpenny , along with popular magazines such as The Illustrated Police News which made the Ripper the beneficiary of previously unparalleled publicity . 
 After the murder of Nichols in early September , the Manchester Guardian reported that : " Whatever information may be in the possession of the police they deem it necessary to keep secret ... It is believed their attention is particularly directed to ... a notorious character known as ' Leather Apron ' . " Journalists were frustrated by the unwillingness of the CID to reveal details of their investigation to the public , and so resorted to writing reports of questionable veracity . Imaginative descriptions of " Leather Apron " appeared in the press , but rival journalists dismissed these as " a mythical outgrowth of the reporter 's fancy " . John <unk> , a local Jew who made footwear from leather , was known by the name " Leather Apron " and was arrested , even though the investigating inspector reported that " at present there is no evidence whatsoever against him " . He was soon released after the confirmation of his alibis . 
 After the publication of the " Dear Boss " letter , " Jack the Ripper " supplanted " Leather Apron " as the name adopted by the press and public to describe the killer . The name " Jack " was already used to describe another fabled London attacker : " Spring @-@ heeled Jack " , who supposedly leapt over walls to strike at his victims and escape as quickly as he came . The invention and adoption of a nickname for a particular killer became standard media practice with examples such as the Axeman of New Orleans , the Boston Strangler , and the Beltway Sniper . Examples derived from Jack the Ripper include the French Ripper , the Düsseldorf Ripper , the Camden Ripper , the Blackout Ripper , Jack the Stripper , the Yorkshire Ripper , and the Rostov Ripper . Sensational press reports combined with the fact that no one was ever convicted of the murders have confused scholarly analysis and created a legend that casts a shadow over later serial killers . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The nature of the murders and of the victims drew attention to the poor living conditions in the East End and galvanised public opinion against the overcrowded , unsanitary slums . In the two decades after the murders , the worst of the slums were cleared and demolished , but the streets and some buildings survive and the legend of the Ripper is still promoted by guided tours of the murder sites . The Ten Bells public house in Commercial Street was frequented by at least one of the victims and was the focus of such tours for many years . In 2015 , the Jack the Ripper Museum opened in east London . 
 In the immediate aftermath of the murders and later , " Jack the Ripper became the children 's bogey man . " Depictions were often <unk> or monstrous . In the 1920s and 1930s , he was depicted in film dressed in everyday clothes as a man with a hidden secret , preying on his unsuspecting victims ; atmosphere and evil were suggested through lighting effects and <unk> . By the 1960s , the Ripper had become " the symbol of a predatory aristocracy " , and was more often portrayed in a top hat dressed as a gentleman . The Establishment as a whole became the villain , with the Ripper acting as a manifestation of upper @-@ class exploitation . The image of the Ripper merged with or borrowed symbols from horror stories , such as Dracula 's cloak or Victor Frankenstein 's organ harvest . The fictional world of the Ripper can fuse with multiple genres , ranging from Sherlock Holmes to Japanese erotic horror . 
 In addition to the contradictions and unreliability of contemporary accounts , attempts to identify the real killer are hampered by the lack of surviving forensic evidence . DNA analysis on extant letters is inconclusive ; the available material has been handled many times and is too contaminated to provide meaningful results . There have been mutually incompatible claims that DNA evidence points conclusively to two different suspects , and the methodology of both has also been criticised . 
 Jack the Ripper features in hundreds of works of fiction and works which straddle the boundaries between fact and fiction , including the Ripper letters and a hoax Diary of Jack the Ripper . The Ripper appears in novels , short stories , poems , comic books , games , songs , plays , operas , television programmes , and films . More than 100 non @-@ fiction works deal exclusively with the Jack the Ripper murders , making it one of the most written @-@ about true @-@ crime subjects . The term " <unk> " was coined by Colin Wilson in the 1970s to describe the study of the case by professionals and amateurs . The periodicals <unk> , <unk> , and Ripper Notes publish their research . 
 There is no waxwork figure of Jack the Ripper at Madame Tussauds ' Chamber of Horrors , unlike murderers of lesser fame , in accordance with their policy of not modelling persons whose likeness is unknown . He is instead depicted as a shadow . In 2006 , BBC History magazine and its readers selected Jack the Ripper as the worst Briton in history .

 = Siege of Malakand = 
 The Siege of Malakand was the 26 July – 2 August 1897 siege of the British garrison in the Malakand region of colonial British India 's North West Frontier Province . The British faced a force of Pashtun tribesmen whose tribal lands had been bisected by the Durand Line , the 1 @,@ 519 mile ( 2 @,@ 445 km ) border between Afghanistan and British India drawn up at the end of the Anglo @-@ Afghan wars to help hold the Russian Empire 's spread of influence towards the Indian subcontinent . 
 The unrest caused by this division of the Pashtun lands led to the rise of Saidullah , a Pashtun fakir who led an army of at least 10 @,@ 000 against the British garrison in Malakand . Although the British forces were divided among a number of poorly defended positions , the small garrison at the camp of Malakand South and the small fort at Chakdara were both able to hold out for six days against the much larger Pashtun army . 
 The siege was lifted when a relief column dispatched from British positions to the south was sent to assist General William Hope Meiklejohn , commander of the British forces at Malakand South . Accompanying this relief force was second lieutenant Winston Churchill , who later published his account as The Story of the Malakand Field Force : An Episode of Frontier War . 
 = = Background = = 
 The rivalry between the British and the Russian Empires , named " The Great Game " by Arthur Conolly , centred on Afghanistan during the late 19th century . From the British perspective , Russian expansion threatened to destroy the so @-@ called " jewel in the crown " of the British Empire , India . As the Tsar 's troops in Central Asia began to subdue one Khanate after another , the British feared that Afghanistan would become a staging post for a Russian invasion . Against this background the British launched the First Anglo @-@ Afghan War in 1838 , and attempted to impose a puppet regime under Shuja Shah . The regime was short @-@ lived , however , and unsustainable without British military support . After the Russians sent an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul in 1878 , tensions were renewed and Britain demanded that the ruler of Afghanistan ( Sher Ali Khan ) accept a British diplomatic mission . The mission was turned back and , in retaliation , a force of 40 @,@ 000 men was sent across the border by the British , launching the Second Anglo @-@ Afghan War . 
 After reaching a virtual stalemate with these two wars against the Afghans , the British imposed the Durand Line in 1893 , which divided Afghanistan and British India ( now the North @-@ West Frontier Province , Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( <unk> ) and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan ) . Named after Sir Mortimer Durand , the foreign secretary of the British Indian government , it was agreed upon by the Emir of Afghanistan ( Abdur Rahman Khan ) and the representatives of the British Empire but deeply resented by the Afghans . Its intended purpose was to serve as a buffer zone to inhibit the spread of Russian influence down into British India . 
 = = = Malakand Field Force = = = 
 The British Malakand Field Force used the town of Nowshera as a base of operations . Nowshera was located south of the Kabul River " six hours by rail from Rawal Pindi " . Commanded by Colonel <unk> , the base served as a hospital while the normal garrison was serving 47 miles ( 76 km ) away at Malakand Pass in what was known as the Malakand South Camp . This force consisted of one British cavalry regiment , one Indian cavalry regiment and one Indian infantry battalion . Winston Churchill , who would accompany the relief force as a second lieutenant and war correspondent , described the camp as " ... a great cup , of which the rim is broken into numerous clefts and jagged points . At the bottom of this cup is the ' crater ' camp . " Churchill goes on to state that the camp was viewed as purely temporary and was indefensible , as a result of its cramped conditions and the fact that it was dominated by the surrounding heights . A nearby camp , North Malakand , was also established on the plains of Khar , intended to hold the large number of troops that were unable to fit into the main camp . Both of these positions were garrisoned for two years with little fear of attack by a 1 @,@ 000 strong force . Officers brought their families , and the camp held regular polo matches and shooting competitions . 
 = = Outbreak of the battle = = 
 Towards 1897 , news of unrest in the nearby Pashtun villages had reached the British garrisons in Malakand . Major Deane , the British political agent , noted the growing unrest within the Pashtun sepoys stationed with the British . His warnings were officially distributed to senior officers on 23 July 1897 ; however , nothing more than a minor skirmish was expected . Rumours of a new religious leader , Saidullah the Sartor Fakir ( also known as Mullah of <unk> ) , arriving to " sweep away " the British and inspire a jihad , were reportedly circulating the bazaars of Malakand during July . Saidullah became known to the British as " The Great Fakir " , " Mad Fakir " or the " Mad Mullah " , and by the Pashtuns as <unk> <unk> , or simply , <unk> , meaning " god @-@ intoxicated " . 
 On July 26 , while British officers were playing polo near camp Malakand North , indigenous spectators who were watching the match learned of an approaching Pashtun force and fled . Brigadier @-@ General Meiklejohn , commander of the Malakand forces , was informed by Deane that " matters had assumed a very grave aspect " and that there were armed Pashtuns gathering nearby . Reinforcements from Mardan ( 32 miles ( 51 km ) away ) were requested , and Lieutenant P. Eliott @-@ Lockhart departed at <unk> At <unk> , a final telegram was received informing the garrison that the Fakir had passed Khar and was advancing on Malakand . The telegram also stated that neither the levies nor the people would act against him , and that the hills to the east of the camp were covered with Pathans . Shortly after , the communication wire was cut .

 During the night of 26 July , sometime after 10 : 00 pm , a messenger arrived with word that the enemy had reached the village of Khar , three miles from Malakand . A bugle call was immediately sounded within the camp . Lieutenant @-@ Colonel McRae , commanding the 45th Sikhs , two units from the 31st Punjab Infantry , two Guns from No. 8 Mountain Battery and one Squadron from the 11th Bengal Lancers , was to have been sent to <unk> Pass – a distance of four miles – with orders to hold the position ; however , the Pashtun column had already arrived at the South Malakand camp , surprising the British defenders , and began to open fire on the garrison with muskets . McRae immediately sent a small number of men under Major Taylor down a road from the " right flank " of the camp to ascertain the enemy 's strength and location ; McRae himself later followed with his own small group . Both parties aimed for a sharp turn in the oncoming road where , flanked by gorges , they hoped to hold the attacking force . McRae , with about 20 men , opened fire on the Pashtun tribesmen and began a fighting withdrawal 50 paces down the road before halting in an attempt to stop the attack . Taylor was mortally wounded in the incident and quickly died ; McRae suffered a neck wound . Nevertheless , by 2 : 00 am reinforcements under the command of Lieutenant <unk> had enabled the British to repel the Pashtun attack . The official dispatches of General Meiklejohn noted that : 
 " There is no doubt that the gallant resistance made by this small body in the gorge , against vastly superior numbers , till the arrival of the rest of the regiment , saved the camp from being rushed on that side , and I cannot speak too highly of the behaviour of Lieutenant @-@ Colonel McRae and Major Taylor on this occasion . " 
 Meanwhile , Pashtun forces had successfully assaulted the camp in three other locations , and the 24th Punjab Infantry 's picket lines were quickly overrun . Pashtun sharpshooters occupying the nearby heights inflicted casualties throughout the night , and the bazaar and surrounding buildings were occupied . Other units of the 24th , under Lieutenant Climo , retook the area and held it until 10 : 45 pm , but under fire from sharpshooters they were driven back . The Pashtun forces broke through in a number of other locations . Lieutenant Watling commanding a group of British troops guarding the ammunitions stores at the Quarter Guard was wounded , losing the stores in the process . Meiklejohn led a small group of sappers , members of the 24th and Captain Holland , Climo from the earlier charge , and Lieutenant Manley to recapture the ammunition dump ; Holland and the General were wounded , and the group severely depleted as it twice failed to retake the dump , but a third attempt proved successful . However , continuing crossfire from the enveloping Pashtun troops wounded a number of British officers , placing the command of the 24th with Climo . Towards 1 : 00 am on the morning of July 27 , Lieutenant Edmund William Costello rescued a wounded havildar while under fire and was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions . 
 As the night wore on , reinforcements arrived from a nearby British hill fort which had as yet been ignored by the Pashtun forces . At 4 : 15 pm , the attacking forces withdrew with their dead and wounded . The British had lost a large number of officers wounded , and recorded 21 deaths amongst the sepoys .

 During the first night of the battle , the garrison at Malakand North had not seen much action despite being in the more exposed position , and had spent much of the night firing flares and manoeuvring artillery units . In response Meiklejohn ordered a reconnaissance of the vicinity , whereupon Major Gibbs , the commander of the force , encountered large groups of tribesmen in the valley . Subsequently , he was eventually ordered to collect his forces and stores from Malakand North , and transfer them into the southern camp . 
 = = = July 27 = = = 
 The last remaining forces from the now evacuated northern camp arrived in Malakand South at 8 : 30 am on the 27th , coinciding with the arrival of more Pashtun reinforcements . In Nowshera , the 11th Bengal Lancers awoke to news describing the situation , and , together with the 38th Dogras , the 35th Sikhs , No.1 and No.7 British Mountain Batteries , they set off to relieve the besieged garrison . Meanwhile , at Malakand South , fresh Pashtun attacks were repulsed by elements of the 24th led by Climo , whose unit captured a Pashtun standard . 
 At 7 : 30 pm the first of the British reinforcements arrived in the form of infantry from the Corps of Guides under Lieutenant Lockhart . The 45th Sikhs , supported by 100 men from the Guides and two guns , remained astride the main road into the camp , while the 31st Punjab Infantry held the centre ; the 24th , under Climo , held the north edge of Malakand South . Subadar Syed Ahmed Shah of the 31st held the area around the bazaar , though the market place itself was left unoccupied . Around 8 : 00 pm the Pashtuns simultaneously attacked all the British positions where , " Many thousands of rounds were discharged " and a number of assaults repulsed . Subadar Syed Ahmed Shah and his forces defended their position for several hours , however the Pashtuns were eventually successful in undermining the walls and killing the defenders . The surviving sepoys and their leader were awarded the Order of Merit . The 24th also repelled a number of charges , with VC recipient Costello receiving a wound in the arm . Despite the constant harassment by musket fire , rifle fire and a barrage of rocks , Climo successfully led a counter @-@ attack with two companies , pushing the attacking forces back two miles . The British records for the night of July 27 record 12 killed among the sepoy ranks , as well as the wounding of Costello . 
 = = = July 28 = = = 
 The daylight hours of 28 July saw continuous fire from the Pashtun sharpshooters established in the hills surrounding Malakand South . The garrison surgeon , Lieutenant J.H. Hugo , treated a number of British casualties including an officer from the Guides . Despite further attacks during the night of July 28 / 29 , the British recorded only two killed from the sepoy ranks , and the severe wounding of a Lieutenant Ford . Churchill records that Ford 's bleeding artery was clamped shut by Hugo despite being under fire . 
 = = = July 29 – July 31 = = = 
 Having re @-@ established communication on the morning of 29 July , the British garrison signalled the approaching relief forces via heliograph at 8 : 00 am – " Heavy fighting all night . Expect more tonight . What ammunition are you bringing ? When may we expect you ? " During the day , the Pashtuns prepared for another night attack while the British destroyed the bazaar and the regions previously defended , and lost , by Subadar Syed Ahmed Shah and the men of the 31st . Trees were also cut down to improve fields of fire , attracting further attention from the Pashtun sharpshooters . Major Stuart <unk> arrived at 4 : 00 pm on the 29th with the 11th Bengal Lancers who had been summoned from Nowshera two days previous . The 35th Sikhs and 38th Dogras arrived at the mouth of the pass leading to Malakand South , but after losing between 19 and 21 of their ranks through heat exhaustion , they were forced to halt . 
 At 2 : 00 a.m. on 30 July , the Pashtuns launched another attack , during which Costello , and the Pashtun Mullah , were both wounded ; the British also recorded one fatality among the sepoy contingent . That evening a further attack was repulsed by a bayonet charge of the 45th Sikhs . The following morning , on 31 July , the remainder of the 38th Dogras and 35th Sikhs entered Malakand South under the command of Colonel Reid , bringing with them 243 mules carrying 291 @,@ 600 rounds of ammunition . But with their attention now drawn towards the nearby British outpost of Chakdara , attacks by the Pashtuns on Malakand South began to reduce until they ceased altogether . Churchill records a total of three British officers killed in action and 10 wounded , seven sepoy officers wounded , and 153 non @-@ commissioned officers killed and wounded during the siege of Malakand South . 
 = = Relieving Chakdara = = 
 On 28 July , when word of the attacks were received , a division of " 6800 bayonets , 700 lances or sabres , with 24 guns " was given to Major @-@ General Sir Bindon Blood with orders to hold " the Malakand , and the adjacent posts , and of operating against the neighbouring tribes as may be required . " Blood arrived at Nowshera on 31 July 1897 to take command , and on 1 August he was informed that the Pashtun forces had turned their attention to the nearby British fort of Chakdara . This was a small , under @-@ garrisoned fort with few supplies that had itself been holding out with 200 men since the first attacks in Malakand began , and had recently sent the signal " Help us " to the British forces . Blood reached Malakand at noon on the same day . While Blood and his relief force marched for Chakdara from the main camp at Nowshera , Meiklejohn set out from Malakand South with the 45th , 24th and guns from No. 8 Battery . An advance force of Guides cavalry under Captain Baldwin met with an enemy force along the road and were forced to retreat with two British officers and one sepoy officer wounded and 16 other ranks killed or wounded . 
 Following this failed attempt , Blood arrived and appointed Reid commander of the forces at Malakand South , giving command of the rescue force to Meiklejohn . The rescue column of 1 @,@ 000 infantry , two squadrons from the 11th Bengal Lancers , two of the Guides cavalry , 50 sappers , two cannons and a hospital detail , rested on the night of August 1 , despite a night attack by Pashtun forces . On the following day , the relief force advanced along the road to the abandoned Malakand North in order to avoid fire from the Pashtun sharpshooters who still occupied the heights around the Malakand South " cup " . With low morale , the relief force assembled at 4 : 30 am on 2 August ; however , with the use of diversionary attacks , they were successful in breaking out of the Pashtun encirclement without loss . This led to confusion amongst the Pashtun forces , " like ants in a disturbed ant – hill " as observed Blood . The 11th Bengal Lancers and the Guides cavalry went on to relieve the threatened fort at Chakdara , while the 45th Sikhs stormed nearby Pashtun positions . The British recorded 33 casualties from the action on August 2 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The campaigns of the Malakand Field Force continued beyond the siege of Malakand South , North , and of the Chakdara fort . Immediately after the siege , two brigades of the British garrison were relocated to a new camp a few miles away to relieve the pressure in the overcrowded Malakand South . These received only light fire during 5 August 1897 ; however , on 8 August , Saidullah rallied his surviving Pashtun forces and attacked the British garrison at <unk> fort near Peshawar . These attacks put the continued loyalty of friendly Pashtun levies guarding the British supply lines to Chitral at risk , thus endangering the supply convoys and their small escorts . In response , on 14 August , the British advanced farther into Pashtun territory and engaged a force of " several thousand " Pashtun tribesmen , with General Meiklejohn leading a flanking manoeuvre which split the Pashtun army in two , forcing it to pull back to <unk> . The British continued to engage Pashtun tribesmen throughout the day , suffering two officers and 11 other ranks killed . 
 The siege of Malakand was Winston Churchill 's first experience of actual combat , which he later described in several columns for The Daily Telegraph , receiving £ 5 per column ; these articles were eventually compiled into his first published book , The Story of the Malakand Field Force , beginning his career as a writer and politician . Of the book 's publication he remarked , " [ it ] will certainly be the most noteworthy act of my life . Up to date ( of course ) . By its reception I shall measure the chances of my possible success in the world . " Of the siege of Malakand , and of the entire campaign against the Pashtun tribes in northern India , Churchill remarked that they were a period of significant " transition " . 
 The War Office authorized the award of the clasp Malakand 1897 to the India Medal for those of the British and Indian armies who participated in this action . The battleground remained closed to visitors and under military control since the publication of Churchill 's memoirs , and is the location of a Pakistani military base . However , in 2006 the Pakistani government began opening the area to foreign visitors . 
 = El Salvador national football team = 
 El Salvador 's National Football Team ( Selección de <unk> de El Salvador in Spanish ) represents El Salvador in international football and is controlled by the Salvadoran Football Federation ( FESFUT ) . In 1899 , two teams from Santa Ana and San Salvador met for the first known football game in El Salvador . The national team 's first match was played in September 1921 , when they were invited to participate in a tournament to celebrate 100 years of Central American Independence . 
 El Salvador has made two FIFA World Cup appearances : first in 1970 and again in 1982 , but have never progressed beyond the first stage of a finals tournament . They were the 1943 CCCF champions , and finished in second @-@ place in the 1941 and 1961 championships . They have competed in the CONCACAF regional tournaments fourteen times , finishing as runners @-@ up in 1963 and 1981 . La Selecta also competes in the biennial UNCAF Nations Cup , the Pan American Games , the Olympics , and have achieved two gold medals in the Central American and Caribbean Games . 
 The Estadio Cuscatlán , also known as " El <unk> de Montserrat " and " La Catedral del Espectáculo " , is the official home stadium of the El Salvador national football team . Since 2008 , the national team has had a kit sponsorship contract with England @-@ based supplier Mitre . Raúl Díaz Arce is the all @-@ time top @-@ scorer for the national team , with 39 goals , while Alfredo Pacheco has the most caps with 85 appearances .

 = = = Beginnings of the national team = = = 
 Salvadoran football had its origins in the city of Santa Ana , on a field called " Campo Marte " . This was the first time a football game was hosted in El Salvador . That first game took place on July 26 , 1899 among players from Santa Ana and San Salvador . Both teams had several foreign players from England who are credited with introducing football to El Salvador . The home team won the game 2 – 0 . 
 Although El Salvador played a few games in the early part of the 20th century , they did not form an official national team until 1921 when players such as José Pablo Huezo , Carlos Escobar Leiva or Santiago <unk> revolutionized football in the country . In September 1921 , El Salvador were invited to Guatemala to take part in the Independence Centenary Games , to celebrate 100 years of Central American Independence . The tournament was between Guatemala , Honduras , Costa Rica , and El Salvador . The Guatemalans and Costa Ricans had more experience with football than the Salvadorans and Hondurans . It was a single @-@ elimination tournament with Guatemala playing Honduras and El Salvador playing Costa Rica . El Salvador , which were dressed with white shorts and black shirt , utilized the classic 2 – 3 – 5 scheme with Carlos Escobar Leyva ; Spanish resident Santiago <unk> , José Pablo Huezo ; Benjamín Sandoval , Emilio Dawson , and Frenchman Emilio <unk> ; Víctor Recinos , brothers Guillermo and José E. <unk> , Guillermo Sandoval and Enrique Lindo . By halftime Costa Rica was up 3 – 0 , and at the final whistle after 80 minutes ( 40 minutes for each half ) won 7 – 0 . Despite the loss , this tournament was the starting point of the official El Salvador national team . 
 Other than the tournament , El Salvador only played international friendlies ( all against Costa Rica and Honduras ) for the rest of the 1920s . El Salvador lost their first friendly 3 – 0 against Costa Rica , while the second and third ended in a 1 – 0 loss and 0 – 0 draw against Honduras . On 7 December 1928 , El Salvador recorded its first ever win : a 5 – 0 victory over Honduras , the team that would become their traditional rivals . The game was played at Campo Marte , San Salvador , and was not only El Salvador 's first ever recorded win , but also the first time the team had scored in an international match . Gustavo " <unk> " Marroquín scored every goal , becoming the first ever Salvadoran player to score five goals in a single game for the El Salvador national football team ( a feat later equaled by Miguel Cruz and <unk> Corrales . ) 
 = = = 1930s = = = 
 In the early 1930s , El Salvador appointed its first official national coach , American Mark Scott Thompson , in preparation for the 1930 Central American and Caribbean Games in Havana , Cuba . El Salvador finished in fourth place at the games . The Federación <unk> de Fútbol , the official governing football organization in El Salvador , was founded in 1935 . By this time , El Salvador were coached by Spaniard Pablo Ferre Elías . The El Salvador @-@ hosted 1935 Central American and Caribbean Games took place in the new government funded Estadio Flor Blanca , at that time the biggest stadium in the country . The Salvadoran squad consisted of Edmundo <unk> as goalkeeper ; Tobias Rivera and Raúl Castro in defense ; Américo Gonzalez and Napoleon <unk> as midfielders ; and Álex Morales , Rogelio Aviles , Fidel Quintanilla , Miguel " Americano " Cruz , and Andrés Hernández as strikers . Previously the national team had worn black and white striped jerseys and this was the first time they turned out in a blue strip . The team improved their performance over the previous competition to finish in third place as bronze medal winners . 
 In 1938 , the Federación <unk> de Fútbol became affiliates of FIFA . Once again the El Salvador national football team participated in the 1938 Central American and Caribbean Games , hosted in Panama , which were won by Mexico with Costa Rica in second place . El Salvador won two games and lost three out of the five played . A match for third place between Colombia and El Salvador was scheduled but was cancelled due to the bad physical state of the players . El Salvador finished in fourth place by goal difference . 
 = = = 1940s = = = 
 On April 26 , 1940 , the first national football federation was approved , with Dr. Luis Rivas Palacios as president . In 1941 , the first international competition in CONCACAF , the international governing body for football in North America , Central America and the Caribbean , the Central American and Caribbean Championship ( CCCF ) took place in Costa Rica . El Salvador took part for the first time alongside Costa Rica , Curaçao , Nicaragua , and Panama . El Salvador were runners @-@ up , recording two wins , one tie , and one loss . 
 The 1943 CCCF Championship took place in San Salvador with the participation of Costa Rica , Guatemala , and Nicaragua . El Salvador was coached by former national player Américo González . At the end of the tournament , El Salvador and Guatemala ended up with the same number of points and so had to play a tiebreaker . On December 21 , Guatemala failed to show up for the match resulting in El Salvador declaring themselves 1943 CCCF Championship winners by goal difference . This was the country 's first international title . El Salvador 's 10 ‒ 1 set the team 's record for the most goals scored in a single game yet . It was also the second time a Salvadoran player ( Miguel " Americano " Cruz ) had scored five goals in a single match . El Salvador defended their title in the 1946 CCCF Championship , hosted in Costa Rica , alongside six other participants . La Selecta finished in third place , winning three matches and losing two . In the 1948 CCCF Championship , hosted in Guatemala , Costa Rica won the championship for the third time , with El Salvador finishing in fifth place . 
 = = = 1950s = = = 
 El Salvador not participate in qualification for the subsequent World Cups in 1954 , 1958 , 1962 , and 1966 . Reasons for these refusals are unknown but might be do to the cost of travel , since at that time the team had never played so far from home . During these years El Salvador had a good squad , with players like goalkeeper Manuel " <unk> " Garay , Rafael " <unk> " Reyes , Conrado Miranda , Miguel " Americano " Cruz , Rafael <unk> and Mando Rivas . 
 In the group stage of the 1950 Central American and Caribbean Games in Mexico , El Salvador recorded two wins , one tie , and one loss . They began the final round by beating Curaçao 3 – 1 , but lost their other two matches leaving them in fifth place . In 1953 , the El Salvador national football team took part in its fifth CCCF Championship , the 1953 CCCF Championship , hosted in Costa Rica , together with seven other national teams . Costa Rica became champions for the fourth time , and El Salvador finished in fifth place again . 
 At the 1954 Central American and Caribbean Games El Salvador won their second international title under the direction of coach <unk> <unk> , with a team consisting of <unk> Aurora , Manuel " <unk> " Garay , Hugo Moreno , Armando <unk> , Luis Regalado , Conrado Miranda , Fernando Barrios , Ramón " <unk> " Chávez , José Hernández , Mario Montoya , Juan Francisco " <unk> " Barraza , Ricardo " <unk> " Valencia , Alfredo " <unk> " Ruano , and <unk> Hernández . They debuted against Colombia in a 2 – 2 tie , beat Cuba 3 – 1 , beat Mexico 3 – 2 and finally beat Panama 1 – 0 with a goal by " <unk> " Barraza . The 3 – 2 victory against Mexico , with two goals from Mario Montoya ( 16 ' , 36 ' ) and one from Ricardo Valencia ( 37 ' ) , was the first victory by a Central American team against Mexico . 
 In the 1955 CCCF Championship , hosted in Honduras , Costa Rica crowned themselves champions for the fifth time with El Salvador finishing in 4th place . This marked the sixth time El Salvador participated in the CCCF Championship . For unknown reasons they didn 't participate in the 1957 and 1960 CCCF Championships . 
 = = = 1960s = = = 
 El Salvador returned to participate in the 1961 CCCF Championship , hosted in Costa Rica , alongside nine other national teams . Due to the larger number of teams the CCCF Championship shifted to a two round format with two round @-@ robin group stages . In the first round , there were two groups , one with five teams and one with four . The top two teams from both groups advanced to the second stage . El Salvador was placed in the four team group Honduras , the Netherlands Antilles , and Nicaragua , which they topped with two wins and one draw . In the decisive round they finished in second place behind Costa Rica , who won their seventh CCCF Championship . Afterward the tournament was dissolved and replaced with the CONCACAF Championship . 
 The first CONCACAF Championship was hosted in 1963 and El Salvador hosted both the qualification round and final tournament . There were nine other participants , with the format the same as the final CCCF Championship . Costa Rica became the first CONCACAF champions , and El Salvador finished as runners @-@ up . In 1964 Chilean Hernán Carrasco Vivanco , who would later revolutionize Salvadoran football , became coach of the national team . He led the national team for the first time at the 1965 CONCACAF Championship , hosted in Guatemala , where they won 2 games , tied 1 game , and lost two , finishing in fourth place . In 1966 the El Salvador football team took part in the Central American and Caribbean Games for the sixth time in a competition that took place in Puerto Rico . The national team participated alongside seven other teams , finishing in fourth place . In 1968 El Salvador qualified for the Olympic Games for the first time . They lost 4 – 0 to Hungary , 3 – 1 to Israel , and tied 1 – 1 with Ghana . The coach by this time was Rigoberto Guzmán . 
 Gregorio <unk> and his assistant José <unk> coached the team in the qualifying stages for the 1970 FIFA World Cup . This was the first time El Salvador participated in World Cup qualifying . As host , Mexico automatically qualified so there was just one qualification spot up for grabs . El Salvador won group 3 , playing four games , winning three and losing one . Their record was 10 goals for and 5 goals against with 6 points . As a result , they qualified for a 3 @-@ game playoff against group 2 winner and traditional rival , Honduras . The first game , hosted on 8 June 1969 in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa , was won 1 – 0 by the home team and was followed by crowd violence . The second game , hosted on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador , was won 3 – 0 by El Salvador , and was followed by even greater violence . A play @-@ off match took place in Mexico City on 26 June 1969 . El Salvador won 3 – 2 after extra time . As a result of existing tensions being exacerbated by these matches , on 14 July 1969 the two countries began the a 100 @-@ hour @-@ long war known as the Football War . As a result of the conflict , El Salvador and Honduras were both disqualified from entering the 1969 CONCACAF Championship qualification . 
 The final set of qualifying games for the 1970 World Cup took place against Haiti . The first leg was won by El Salvador in Haiti , 2 – 1 , with goals from <unk> Acevedo ( 43 ' ) and Mauricio ' Pipo ' Rodríguez ( 62 ' ) . The second leg was lost 3 – 0 . The playoff game on 8 October 1969 was won by El Salvador with a goal by Juan Ramón " Mon " Martínez ( 14 ' <unk> ) . Thus the El Salvador national football team qualified for their first World Cup , even though it was their first time attempting qualification . 
 " El Pajaro <unk> <unk> " was a Colombian song written by Eliseo Herrera which was very popular in El Salvador during the qualifying stages of the 1970 World Cup . During a radio show , Mauricio <unk> parodied the song , which he named " Arriba con la Selección " . That parody became so famous that it became the " official anthem " of the El Salvador national football team .

 In the World Cup finals El Salvador was drawn into a group with Belgium , Mexico , and the Soviet Union . El Salvador lost their first game 3 – 0 to Belgium in Mexico City on June 3 . The second match was played against the host nation , Mexico , on 7 June . The game was decided by a controversial call near the end of the first half , with the score still at 0 – 0 . Egyptian referee Hussain Kandil awarded a free kick to El Salvador in their own half . However , a Mexican player took the free @-@ kick , passing to another Mexican player who scored . The Salvadoran players protested vigorously , to the extent of physically jostling Bermudan linesman Keith Dunstan , but the goal was allowed to stand . El Salvador restarted the game by kicking the ball into the crowd in protest . They eventually lost the game 4 – 0 . The team 's third and final game occurred on June 10 with El Salvador losing 2 – 0 to the Soviet Union in Mexico City , to finish at the bottom of Group A with 0 points . 
 El Salvador advanced from the first round of 1971 CONCACAF Championship qualification with an aggregate score of 4 – 2 against Nicaragua after home and away legs . In the second round , El Salvador withdrew from the playoff when they had to play against Honduras , meaning Honduras qualified by default . The national team also took part in the 1973 CONCACAF Championship qualification , which doubled as qualification for the 1974 FIFA World Cup , but they did not advance to the final stage after they were eliminated by Guatemala with an aggregate score of 0 – 2 ( 0 – 1 , 0 – 1 . ) The team was managed by Hector D 'Angelo . 
 El Salvador participated at the Pan American Games for the first time in 1975 at the VII ( 7 ) Pan American Games , hosted in Mexico . The national team participated in a group that included Brazil , Costa Rica , and Nicaragua . They debuted with a 4 – 1 win against Nicaragua on October 14 with 3 goals from " Pajarito " Huezo and the debut of Francisco " Paco " Jovel . Then they played against Brazil on the 15th and lost 0 – 2 . They ended the tournament by playing against Costa Rica , where they tied 0 – 0 , and wherein " Pelé " Zapata missed a penalty . They finished at third place in Group D , failing to advance to the next round . 
 In 1977 CONCACAF Championship qualification La Selecta played against three other teams ( Costa Rica , Guatemala , and Panama ) in a home @-@ and @-@ away round @-@ robin group . The top two finishers advanced final tournament . Guatemala won the group and El Salvador was runner – up .

 El Salvador played four other teams ( Costa Rica , Guatemala , Honduras , and Panama ) in 1981 CONCACAF Championship qualification , once again in a home @-@ and @-@ away round @-@ robin group with the top two teams advancing to the final tournament . El Salvador and Honduras finished top of the group with equal point . Honduras was acclaimed group winner by goal difference . Once again the finals would be doubling as World Cup qualification , this time for the 1982 FIFA World Cup . The format was one six – team group stage , with the first place team winning the tournament , and qualifying for the World Cup alongside the runner – up . Going into the final matches , with every team having played 4 matches out of five , El Salvador had 4 points and was in third place by goal difference , with Mexico ( second place ) and Canada ( fourth place ) both also having 4 points . Honduras led with 7 points , Cuba was in fifth with 3 points , and Haiti was last with 2 points . On 19 November 1981 , in their final match El Salvador beat Haiti 1 – 0 , their goal being a penalty kick taken by Norberto Huezo , bringing them to 6 points . On 21 November Canada tied with Cuba 2 – 2 , eliminating both teams . In the decisive match on 22 November , Honduras tied with Mexico 0 – 0 , meaning Honduras won the tournament and Honduras and El Salvador qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup , the second ( and last ) time El Salvador qualified for the World Cup . The national team was under the direction of Mauricio " Pipo " Rodríguez . 
 In 1982 El Salvador took a 20 – man squad ( two players short of the normal 22 , as a controversial cost – saving measure ) , coached by the aforementioned Mauricio " Pipo " Rodríguez , to Spain . The team 's experience was an unhappy one . In their first match on June 15 in Elche , they were defeated 10 – 1 by Hungary , a scoreline that stands as a World Cup record to this day . A silver lining was that Luis Baltazar Ramírez Zapata scored the country 's first World Cup goal during the game , albeit at a point when the Salvadorans were already down 5 – 0 . It was cold comfort however . When Zapata scored against Hungary , some Salvadorans cried out to Zapata not to celebrate the goal effusively because it might make the Hungarians mad and encourage them to score more . El Salvador managed to regain some pride in their subsequent games . Displaying much @-@ improved levels of organisation and commitment , they lost 1 – 0 to Belgium on June 19 in Elche and 2 – 0 to the then @-@ reigning world champions , Argentina , in Alicante on June 23 . 
 There were several reasons the tournament went so badly for El Salvador . First of all , El Salvador took 20 players to the World Cup , leaving behind Gilberto Quinteros and Miguel González . According to Luis Guevara Mora , goalkeeper of the team by that time , the Salvadoran Football Federation decided to take members of the Federation , as well as the friends and family of many members of the Federation , and spent so much money they couldn 't afford to bring a full 22 – man squad . Some fellow players tried to gather money to pay to bring their teammates but couldn 't get enough . Further heightening controversy , the team took many detours and stops throughout Europe under the direction of the Federation , taking 3 days to arrive in Spain and were the last team to do so . Once arrived , there was more trouble . Adidas sent four white and three blue uniforms for each player , but mysteriously only three white and one blue arrived . The remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by the association . They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake . Next , someone stole the balls that the team would train with . The day prior to the match against Hungary , the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them and trained with them while El Salvador had none and was unable to train . To make things even worse , El Salvador had never seen Hungary play . The only knowledge that they had about the team was a lone outdated video that they had bought . On the field there were more problems . Hungary 's fourth goal was caused by Francisco Jovel 's sudden deafness . Jovel had received a heavy blow on the cheek and almost could not hear . So when Guevara Mora cried off to stop a ball , the defender did not hear him . Mora attempted to pass to Jovel , but Jovel wasn 't looking and the ball went past him and went straight in front of the net . The Hungarian player only had to tap it in . After the match , the Salvadoran squad had a tense meeting with the coaching staff and Federation . The coach was dismissed immediately and the following matches against Belgium and Argentina were managed by players Jovel , Huezo and <unk> . Although the tournament overall was a big disappointment , there were also several bright spots . Jorge " Mágico " González was considered by the national and international press as the best player . " Mágico " González stayed in Spain after the tournament and played for Cádiz CF and Real Valladolid .

 On 11 May 2010 the FIFA Emergency Committee suspended the Salvadoran Football Federation ( FESFUT ) on account of government interference . This decision by FIFA was based on the fact that the statutes ratified by the FESFUT general assembly in August 2009 had not been formally entered in the country 's official register , and that the government had failed to acknowledge the authority of the <unk> Committee set up to represent FESFUT . Consequently , FIFA considered that it was not possible for FESFUT to organise the general assembly in line with the action plan that had been drawn up , and suspended FESFUT . For the suspension to be lifted , Salvadoran authorities needed to recognize the legitimacy of the <unk> Committee of the Salvadoran Football Association . The suspension was lifted by May 28 . By FIFA lifting the suspension , La Selecta was once again allowed to participate in international tournaments at both club and national levels . El Salvador 's under @-@ 21 team qualified for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games ( CAC ) tournament in Mayagüez , Puerto Rico . However , CONCACAF decided to suspend football at the 2010 CAC shortly thereafter . El Salvador was also able to participate in the qualifying tournament for the 2012 Summer Olympics .

El Salvador was drawn into a group with Belize , Nicaragua , and Panama . La Selecta defeated Nicaragua 2 – 0 , Belize 5 – 2 , and lost 2 – 0 against Panama , which was enough to let them advance from the group in second place . In the semifinals they lost to Honduras , again by a 2 – 0 score . In the third place match , they faced Panama again , losing in a penalty shootout 4 – 5 after a 0 – 0 draw . This performance was enough to qualify El Salvador for the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup . The team was coached by José Luis <unk> . Forward Rafael Burgos jointly received the Golden Boot with Costa Rica 's Marco <unk> three goals . 
 In April 2011 , two months before the start of the Gold Cup , José Luis <unk> was replaced as coach by Rubén Israel , who introduced a new system and spirit into the team . At the 2011 Gold Cup , El Salvador was drawn into a group with Costa Rica , Cuba , and powerhouses Mexico . Despite losing 5 – 0 to Mexico , a dramatic 1 – 1 draw with Costa Rica ( where Rodolfo Zelaya scored a 25 @-@ yard free kick opener at 45 ' and Costa Rica equalized at 90 + 5 ) and a 6 – 1 win over Cuba were enough to send El Salvador to the knockout stage . This was the first time El Salvador had reached the knockout stage of a Gold Cup since the 2003 edition . In the quarter finals they faced Panama . The game ended in a 1 – 1 draw , with Panama controversially equalizing at 89 ' when striker Luis Tejada weaved between several defenders and drove a ball that was caught by goalkeeper Miguel Montes . This was controversial for two reasons . One , there was confusion as to whether the shot from Tejada was with his head or his hand . Two , it was unclear whether the ball had crossed the line . Eventually , referee <unk> Quesada ruled that Montes caught the ball behind the goal line thus tying the game at 1 – 1 in the last minute of regular time . Coach Rubén Israel called the decision an " error of haste . " Panama won the ensuing penalty shootout 5 – 3 . 
 In 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification , El Salvador received a bye to the second round . There , they were drawn into a home @-@ and @-@ away round @-@ robin group with the Cayman Islands , the Dominican Republic , and Suriname . La Selecta won their first match , against the Dominican Republic , 3 – 2 with goals scored by Rodolfo Zelaya ( 54 ' , 77 ' ) and Christian Javier Bautista ( 63 ' ) , but left many doubts about their performance . El Salvador , however , convincingly won their next match , against the Cayman Islands , 1 – 4 with goals from Christian Bautista ( 50 ' ) and defenders Luis Anaya ( 63 ' , 80 ' ) and Xavier García ( 90 + 3 ' ) before winning the return leg against the Dominican Republic 1 – 2 . Although El Salvador received the necessary 3 points , the performance of the team was not as expected . La Selecta demonstrated more skill in their 4 – 0 in their home match against the Cayman Islands . The goals were scored by Víctor <unk> ( 5 ' ) , Steve Purdy ( 12 ' ) , Jaime Alas ( 44 ' ) and Herbert Sosa ( pen . 88 ' ) . The last was the 1000th goal scored in the history of the El Salvador national football team . After that , they easily won their remaining games to complete the second round with a perfect record of six wins in six matches . 
 With six wins in six matches , the Uruguayan coach Rubén Israel qualified the football team of El Salvador for the third round for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification ( CONCACAF ) . Fallen into the same group as Mexico , Costa Rica and Guyana , El Salvador heroic snatched a draw in San José ( Costa Rica ) ( after being 2 – 0 down to score ) on 8 Jun 2012 . Four days later , a home defeat against Mexico ( 1 – 2 ) precipitated the departure of Rubén Israel whose poor relations with Jaime Rodríguez , president of the National Institute of Sport Salvador ( <unk> ) were known all . Salvadoran Football Association ( FESFUT ) under pressure following the surprise resignation of Rubén Israel , named the Mexican Juan de Dios Castillo at the head of the selection July 14 , 2012 . Despite a good start ( 1 – 0 in a friendly match against Guatemala after 10 years of failure against this opponent ) , a draw conceded at Estadio Cuscatlán in 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification ( CONCACAF ) , facing a modest Guyana national football team ( 2 – 2 ) earned him the wrath of the public . A victory in extremis ( 2 – 3 ) at Georgetown , Guyana ( with a penalty stopped by goalkeeper <unk> Portillo in additional time ) allowed El Salvador to stay in the race for qualification to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil . Unfortunately the home defeat ( 0 – 1 ) against Costa Rica buried the hopes of qualifying for the national team . Juan de Dios Castillo was removed from office in November 2012 and replaced on December 17 by the Peruvian Agustín Castillo , five national champion with C.D. FAS . Against all odds , El Salvador finished 3rd in the 2013 Copa <unk> mean qualification for the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup in the USA in July when El Salvador shares the same group as Honduras , Trinidad and Tobago and Haiti .

Óláfr was the son of Guðrøðr Óláfsson , King of the Isles , King of Dublin , and his wife Finnguala , granddaughter of Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn , High King of Ireland , King of Cenél nEógain . Óláfr was a younger son of his father ; his elder brother Rögnvaldr more than likely had a different mother . According to the Chronicle of Mann , Guðrøðr appointed Óláfr as heir since he had been born " in lawful wedlock " . Whether or not this is the case , on Guðrøðr 's death in 1187 the Manxmen instead appointed Rögnvaldr as king , as he was a capable adult and Óláfr was a mere child . Rögnvaldr ruled the Crovan dynasty 's island @-@ kingdom for almost 40 years , during which time the half @-@ brothers vied for the kingship . 
 At one point Óláfr , who had been given possession of Lewis , complained to Rögnvaldr that his lands were not enough . Rögnvaldr 's response was seize Óláfr and send him to the King of Scots , where he was imprisoned for almost seven years . Upon his release , Óláfr undertook a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela , after which the half @-@ brothers were reconciled and Rögnvaldr had Óláfr married to Lauon , the sister of his own wife . Sometime after 1217 this marriage was nullified by Reginald , Bishop of the Isles , who may have been an ally of Óláfr against Rögnvaldr . Óláfr then married Christina , a daughter of the King of Scots ' protégé Ferchar , Earl of Ross . The chronicle claims that Rögnvaldr 's bitter wife tricked their own son , Guðrøðr , into attempting to kill Óláfr ; however , Óláfr narrowly escaped with his life and fled to the protection of his father @-@ in @-@ law on the mainland . Together with a loyal follower , one Páll Bálkason , Óláfr later defeated Guðrøðr on Skye . 
 In the 1220s Rögnvaldr formed an alliance with Alan , Lord of Galloway , in an attempt to fend off Óláfr . Rögnvaldr married his daughter to one of Alan 's sons , and it has been theorised that this son was intended to inherit the island @-@ kingdom . Rögnvaldr 's actions enraged the Manxmen and in 1226 they deposed him in favour of Óláfr . Rögnvaldr was later killed battling Óláfr in 1229 . 
 In 1230 Óláfr fled to Norway to seek military assistance against Alan and members of Clann Somairle . The Norwegian king 's response was to send a fleet into the Isles under the command of Óspakr <unk> , a member of Clann Somairle . Óspakr was slain early in the campaign , after which Óláfr took control of the fleet and secured himself on Mann . The island @-@ kingdom was divided between him and his mutilated nephew Guðrøðr , with the latter ruling the Hebridean portion and Óláfr ruling Mann itself . Guðrøðr was soon after killed on Lewis , and Óláfr ruled the whole Kingdom of Mann and the Isles peacefully , until his death in 1237 . Óláfr 's restoration on Mann was seen as a success by the Norwegians , and likely favourably viewed by the Scots as well ; since the internal struggle between him and his rivals had been brought to an end . Óláfr was succeeded by his son , Haraldr . In all , three of Óláfr 's sons ruled the Crovan dynasty 's island @-@ kingdom — the last of which , Magnus Olafsson , was also the last of the dynasty to rule . 
 = = Background = = 
 Óláfr was a member of the Crovan dynasty of sea @-@ kings , a younger son of Guðrøðr Óláfsson , King of the Isles , King of Dublin ( d . 1187 ) , and grandson of Óláfr Guðrøðarson , King of the Isles ( d . 1153 ) . Guðrøðr inherited a vast island @-@ kingdom from his father , which encompassed the Hebrides — situated on the western seaboard of Scotland — and the Isle of Man ( Mann ) , located in the middle of the northern Irish Sea , a strategically important point approximately equidistant from the islands of Great Britain and Ireland . In the mid 12th century Guðrøðr lost control of much of the Inner Hebrides to Somairle , Lord of Argyll , and was unable to regain these islands on Somairle 's death in 1164 . Like his predecessors , Guðrøðr is sometimes anachronistically styled " King of Mann " in secondary sources . This is because Guðrøðr , his sons Rögnvaldr and Óláfr , and his father Óláfr styled themselves Rex Insularum ( " King of the Isles " ) ; it was not until the reigns of Guðrøðr 's grandsons ( Óláfr 's sons ) that the leading members of the dynasty adopted the Latin title Rex Mannie et Insularum ( " King of Mann and the Isles " ) . 
 Óláfr 's epithet " the black " , considered to refer to his hair colour , is recorded in the Orkneyinga saga and within a 13th @-@ century English document , the Close Roll . 
 = = Ascension of Rögnvaldr Guðrøðarson = = 
 According to the Chronicle of Mann Guðrøðr , in 1187 , instructed that his younger son Óláfr should succeed to the kingdom , since Óláfr had been born " in lawful wedlock " . Other contemporary sources record that two decades prior to this the papal legate , Vivian Cardinal priest of St Stephen in Celio Monte , visited Mann for a fortnight in late December 1176 , as he sailed from Scotland to Ireland . The chronicle records that during his visit the cardinal formally married Guðrøðr to Finnguala , daughter of an unnamed son of Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn , High King of Ireland ( d . 1166 ) . Finnguala 's father was more than likely Niall Mac Lochlainn , King of Cenél nEógain ( died 1176 ) . Since the chronicle contradicts itself in detailing Óláfr 's age , it is uncertain whether he was born during the year of his father 's marriage , or a few years before — what is certain , however , is that Rögnvaldr was older than Óláfr . 
 Although the chronicle indirectly implies that Rögnvaldr was also a son of Finnguala , there is evidence that strongly suggests that he had a different mother . Within a letter from Óláfr to Henry II , King of England , Óláfr describes Rögnvaldr as a bastard . Further evidence is found within a Gaelic praise @-@ poem of Rögnvaldr , which states that he was a son of <unk> , an otherwise unknown Irishwoman who may have been an unrecorded wife or concubine of Guðrøðr . The chronicle records that because Óláfr was only a child at the time of his father 's death , the Manxmen chose Rögnvaldr to rule instead , describing him as a vigorous and hardier man . The chronicle states that Rögnvaldr began his reign the following year , in 1188 . 
 = = In the Outer Isles , and imprisonment = = 
 The Chronicle of Mann states that Rögnvaldr gave Óláfr possession of Lewis , which is described as an island ; Lewis is in fact the northern part of the island of Lewis and Harris , which is by far the largest island in Scotland . The northern part of the island is rather flat and boggy , while the southern part , Harris , is more mountainous . The chronicle seems , however , to have conflated the northern and southern parts as it describes Óláfr 's island as being mountainous and rocky , completely unsuitable for cultivation , and declares that the island 's small population lived mostly by hunting and fishing . The chronicle relates that Óláfr was unable to support himself and his followers , because of his poor land , and states that he led " a sorry life " . 
 Óláfr 's time in the Isles is confirmed by several Icelandic sources which recount how , in 1202 , Guðmundr <unk> attempted to sail from Iceland to Norway to become consecrated as the Bishop of <unk> . These saga accounts relate how the Icelanders encountered a severe storm and were blown far off course before being forced to make landfall in the Hebrides . The island they landed upon was almost certainly Sanday , a tiny tidal island linked to its larger neighbour Canna , the westernmost of the Small Isles . According to the saga the Icelanders were pressured numerous times to pay a landing @-@ tax to a king named Óláfr . The king encountered by the Icelanders is considered to have been Óláfr , although at this point in history the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles is not known to have encompassed the Small Isles . One possibility is that Óláfr , like the Icelanders , may have been temporarily stranded on the tidal island , and that he may have taken advantage of the storm @-@ stricken churchmen to offset the poverty that is assigned to him by the chronicle . 
 The chronicle also relates that Óláfr went to Rögnvaldr , who was also living in the Hebrides , and asked him for more land . Rögnvaldr 's response was , according to the chronicle , to have Óláfr seized and sent to William I , King of Scots , who kept him imprisoned for almost seven years . The chronicle states that , on the seventh year , William died and that just before his death ordered the release of all his political prisoners . William is known to have died on 4 December 1214 . The chronicle relates that upon gaining his freedom , Óláfr met with Rögnvaldr on Mann , and then set out on a pilgrimage with a significant number of noblemen . Óláfr 's intended destination is considered to have been the shrine of St James at Santiago de Compostela in Spain .

 Upon Óláfr 's return the chronicle says that Rögnvaldr welcomed him back and had him marry Lauon , the daughter of a certain nobleman from Kintyre , who was also the sister of his own wife . The precise identification of the father @-@ in @-@ law of Óláfr and Rögnvaldr is uncertain , but he may have been a member of Clann Somairle ; possibly Ragnall mac Somairle , or his son Ruaidrí , who are both styled Lord of Kintyre in documents contemporaneous to their reigns . The chronicle states that Rögnvaldr then gave Lewis back to Óláfr , where the newly @-@ weds proceeded to live until the arrival of Reginald , Bishop of the Isles ( d. c . 1226 ) , sometime later . According to the chronicle the bishop disapproved of Óláfr 's marriage , as Óláfr had formerly had a concubine who was a cousin of Lauon . A synod was then assembled and the chronicle records that the marriage was nullified . Although at first glance the marriage appears to have been doomed , as it was deemed " as being within prohibited degree of kinship " , it may be that this was merely a convenient excuse , and that the contention between the half @-@ brothers may have played a part in its demise . It is also possible that Bishop Reginald may have released Óláfr from an arranged marriage which had been forced upon him ; the bishop and Óláfr appear to have been close , as the chronicle describes Bishop Reginald as a son of Óláfr 's sister , and notes that Óláfr was glad at his coming to Lewis . Furthermore , it was Bishop Reginald who annulled the marriage which Rögnvaldr had arranged for Óláfr . In fact , when the previous Bishop of the Isles died in 1217 , Bishop Reginald had vied with a rival candidate for the position — a certain Nicholas — and there is evidence to suggest that Reginald was supported by Óláfr , while Óláfr 's half @-@ brother Rögnvaldr supported the bid of Nicholas . 
 The chronicle states that Óláfr then married Christina , daughter of Ferchar mac an t @-@ <unk> ( d. c . 1251 ) . Óláfr 's father @-@ in @-@ law emerges from historical obscurity in 1215 and , by the mid 1220s ( about the time of , or not long after , the marriage ) , Ferchar had obtained the Earldom of Ross from Alexander II , King of Scots ( d . 1249 ) for his part in defeating the Meic Uilleim northern rebellion in 1215 . The chronicle declares that Óláfr 's separation from Lauon had enraged her sister , and Rögnvaldr 's bitter queen sought to sow discord between the half @-@ brothers . If the chronicle is to be believed , the queen secretly wrote under her husband 's name to their son Guðrøðr , ordering him to seize and kill Óláfr . The chronicle states that Guðrøðr dutifully gathered a force on Skye and proceeded to Lewis , where he laid waste to most of the island before returning to Skye — Óláfr had narrowly escaped with a few men and fled to the protection of his father @-@ in @-@ law , on the mainland in Ross . 
 One of the more powerful men in the Isles at this time , according to the chronicle , was a sheriff on Skye named Páll Bálkason . Páll refused to take up arms against Óláfr and he left Skye to live in Ross with Óláfr . After several days Páll and Óláfr secretly returned to Skye , according to the chronicle , and learned that Guðrøðr was stationed on the " island of St Columba " . The location and identity of the island are unknown for certain , although Iona and various places and islands on Skye are possible . The chronicle tells how Óláfr and Páll rounded up their forces and dragged five ships from the seashore , which is described as being about two furlongs from the island , and subsequently surrounded Guðrøðr 's island . The chronicle states that Óláfr and Páll assaulted the island at about 2 – 3 pm , and that everyone one of Guðrøðr 's followers who was captured outside of the enclosure of the church was slain . Guðrøðr was seized , blinded and castrated . The chronicle claims that Óláfr did not consent to Guðrøðr 's brutal mutilation , but was unable to prevent it due to Páll . 
 = = Rise of Óláfr , and fall of Rögnvaldr = = 
 Óláfr 's marriage to the daughter of one of Alexander the King of Scots ' most trusted northern lords , and the lord 's assistance rendered to Óláfr and Páll , may suggest that Óláfr had gained Alexander 's approval against Rögnvaldr . In the summer following the defeat of Guðrøðr on Skye , the chronicle states that Óláfr took hostages from the Hebridean portion of the kingdom and , with a fleet of 32 ships , landed on Mann and confronted Rögnvaldr directly . It was then agreed that the kingdom would be split between the two — with Rögnvaldr keeping Mann itself along with the title of king , and Óláfr retaining the Hebridean portions . In the 1220s Alexander began to extend Scottish royal authority into what is today the western coast Scotland , making several expeditions into Argyll . A this time Ruaidrí may have been forced from his lands in Kintyre and replaced by Alexander , installing Domnall mac Ragnaill , a more palatable member of Clann Somairle , in his place . Óláfr 's control of Lewis and Skye , bordering the domains of Clann Somairle , may have made him appear as a potentially valuable ally to Alexander 's eyes , who wished to rein in the more dangerous members of Clann Somairle . 
 Alexander played both sides in the struggle between Óláfr and Rögnvaldr however , and encouraged one of his most powerful lords Alan , Lord of Galloway ( d . 1234 ) , to enter into the fray as an ally of Rögnvaldr . In 1225 , according to the chronicle , Rögnvaldr and Alan attempted to take possession of Óláfr 's Hebridean portion of the kingdom ; however , the Manxmen were unwilling to wholeheartedly aid the cause and nothing came of the expedition . A short time later the chronicle records that Rögnvaldr 's daughter was married to Alan 's son . Such a marriage , between Rögnvaldr 's daughter and Alan 's illegitimate son Thomas , gave Alan a stake in the kingship since Thomas was likely to succeed . The possibility of control over a future ruler on Mann led Alexander to lend his consent to the union . The marriage was beneficial to Rögnvaldr as well , since he could rely on Alan 's military might to fend off his troublesome half @-@ brother . Unfortunately for Rögnvaldr , the chronicle records that the Manxmen were angered by the marriage and they consequently appointed Óláfr as their king . At this point Rögnvaldr seems to have gone into exile in Galloway , at the court of his ally , Alan . The chronicle dates Óláfr 's kingship to have begun in 1226 , and that he ruled the kingdom peacefully for the next two years . 
 The chronicle records that in 1228 , while Óláfr and his chiefs were away from Mann , the island was attacked and devastated by Alan , his brother Thomas , Earl of Atholl ( d . 1231 ) , and Rögnvaldr . It was only when Alan left with most of his force that Óláfr was able to regain control of the island . Rögnvaldr sailed from Galloway in the winter of the same year , landed on Mann , and burnt all the ships of Óláfr and his chiefs . The chronicle states that Rögnvaldr stayed at Ronaldsway for forty days ; and that he won over the hearts of the southern inhabitants of the island . Óláfr and his forces arrived at Tynwald on 14 February 1229 , where they attacked Rögnvaldr and his men . The chronicle claims that Rögnvaldr was treacherously killed by his own men , without the prior knowledge of Óláfr , and also notes that Óláfr never avenged his half @-@ brother 's death . 
 = = Norwegian intervention into the Isles = = 
 The Chronicle of Lanercost states that a Norwegian fleet sailed down the west coast of Scotland in 1230 with a certain Óspakr <unk> ( d . 1230 ) , who had been appointed King of the Isles by the King of Norway ; also amongst the fleet were Óláfr and Guðrøðr . The <unk> version of Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar , the most authoritative version of the saga , gives a much more illustrative account ; although it does not specifically state that Guðrøðr travelled with the fleet from Norway . The saga states that in the summer before the fleet left Norway , news of warring in the Isles reached the Norwegian king , Hákon Hákonarson ( d . 1263 ) . Óláfr is described as a faithful vassal of the Norwegian king , while two Hebridean noblemen , Donnchad and Dubgall — both sons of Dubgall mac Somairle ( fl . 1175 ) — are described as unfaithful . The saga relates how the Norwegian king summoned an assembly that winter , appointed Óspakr King of the Isles , and decided upon a plan to give Óspakr a military force to command in the Isles . 
 It is suspected that members of Clann Somairle may have been attacking parts of the Crovan dynasty 's island @-@ kingdom , possibly taking advantage of the warring between Rögnvaldr and Óláfr . It may have been that they were also lending support to Alan 's destabilising incursions into the Isles . Whatever the case , it is clear that the state of affairs in the Isles was chaotic and , because of Óláfr 's inability to control of the situation , the formidable Hákon decided to pacify the region using Óspakr . In fact , the saga notes that Óspakr was also a son of Dubgall , and it is likely that his family connections would have made him a palatable over @-@ king of the unruly Clann Somairle . Óspakr 's kingdom was likely meant to encompass the territories of Clann Somairle , and control of the Crovan dynasty 's domain may have been retained by the dynasty . 
 The saga states that , with the coming of spring , Hákon ordered the preparation of Óspakr 's fleet . While preparations were under way Óláfr came to the king at Bergen , and reported the unrest in the Isles , noting that Alan had assembled a powerful army and was causing unrest in the region . When the fleet left Norway for Orkney , Óláfr accompanied it on @-@ board Páll Bálkason 's ship . When the fleet reached Orkney , several ship @-@ commanders sailed to Skye , where they defeated a certain <unk> <unk> in a sea @-@ battle . The fleet then united at Islay , and was strengthened by Óspakr 's brothers and their followers , and swelled in size to 80 ships . The fleet then sailed south and around the Mull of Kintyre to Bute , where the force invaded the island and took the castle whilst suffering heavy casualties . The fleet then sailed to Kintyre , and Óspakr fell ill and died . The Chronicle of Mann , however , specifically states that Óspakr was struck by a stone and killed , and later buried on Iona . 
 The chronicle continues by stating that Óláfr then took control of the fleet whereupon he led it to Mann , where he and Guðrøðr divided the kingdom between themselves — with Óláfr retaining Mann , and Guðrøðr controlling the Hebridean portions ; in fact , it is possible that Hákon may have originally intended for Óláfr and Guðrøðr to split the kingdom of Mann and the Isles between themselves . According to the saga the Norwegians left in the spring , sailing north to Kintyre where they encountered and battled a strong force of Scots with both sides losing many men during the ensuing battle . The saga then recounts how the fleet sailed north to Lewis and displaced a certain Þórmóðr <unk> , before travelling to Orkney , from where most of the fleet sailed back to Norway . Páll , however , is stated to have remained behind , and to have been slain by Guðrøðr several weeks later . The saga notes that Guðrøðr was also slain in the Isles a short time after this . The Chronicle of Mann specifically places Guðrøðr 's death on Lewis , although it does not cast any light upon the circumstances . Even so , what is certain is that it was only after Guðrøðr 's death that Óláfr 's kingship was safe from any rival claim . 
 The campaign is regarded to have been the gravest threat to the Scottish kingdom since John , King of England 's ( d . 1216 ) northern campaigning and invasion in 1216 . Although Óláfr 's restoration on Mann was claimed as a success by the Norwegians , it was probably accepted gladly by the Scots as well ; considering Óláfr 's familial relationship with Alexander 's protégé Ferchar and the consolidation of the Crovan dynasty after years of chaos . Óláfr consequently ruled the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles peacefully until his death , seven years later . The chronicle states that he died on St Patrick 's Isle on 21 May 1237 and was buried at St Mary 's Abbey , Rushen . There is a possibility that a coffin @-@ lid or grave @-@ slab found at Rushen may be associated with Óláfr , or of two of his sons who are known to have been buried there ( Rögnvaldr and Magnús ) . 
 = = Family = = 
 Óláfr is known to have been survived by three children ; Haraldr ( d . 1248 ) , Rögnvaldr ( d . 1249 ) , and Magnús ( d . 1265 ) — all of whom ruled as kings in their own right . Although the mother of Óláfr 's children is not known for certain , she is thought to have been Christina . The Chronicle of Mann states that Óláfr 's immediate successor , Haraldr , was only fourteen years old at the time of his father 's death , which dates his birth to about the time of the marriage of Óláfr and Christina . 
 There is evidence to suggest that Óláfr might have had a fourth son named Guðrøðr . For example , the chronicle relates how the governor of Mann , described as a kinsman of Haraldr , fled from the king in 1238 and set sail for Wales , taking with him his foster @-@ son Guðrøðr Óláfsson . When the fleeing ship reached the Welsh coast it was wrecked and , according to the chronicle , Guðrøðr perished on board . Furthermore , amongst the names of witnesses within a quitclaim between Llywelyn ap Gruffudd ( d . 1282 ) and Ralph de Mortimer ( d . 1246 ) , thought to date to about 1241 , there is a certain Guðrøðr who appears in Latin as <unk> filio regis Mannie ( " Guðrøðr , son of the King of Mann " ) . Although the possibility has been raised that the two sources may refer to the same man , there is no further evidence to confirm it . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Manx Sword of State , a ceremonial sword used at the annual Tynwald Day sittings at St John 's , Isle of Man , and whenever the Tynwald sits at the Legislative Chambers in Douglas , Isle of Man , is popularly said to have belonged to Óláfr . The sword , which has a 29 in ( 74 cm ) steel blade and 9 in ( 23 cm ) inch hardwood hilt , is sometimes said to have been brought back from Spain when Óláfr returned from his pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela ; however , recent analysis of the sword has determined that it dates no earlier than the 15th century , and that the blade dates only to the 17th century . The current understanding is that the sword itself was made for the Tynwald meetings of 1417 or 1422 . 
 Several Scottish clans that were historically seated on Lewis have traditionally been ascribed a descent from Óláfr . The MacLeods claim a descent from Leod ( Old Norse Ljótr ) , who is popularly said to have been a son of Óláfr . Clan traditions dating to the late 18th century link Leod with Óláfr , and heraldic evidence dating to the late 17th century may be the earliest indication of such a claim ; however , recent research into the MacLeods ' traditional ancestry has determined such claims of descent from Óláfr are unsupportable . Other Lewis clans have been linked with Óláfr in various traditions , such as the Morrisons of Ness and their adversaries the Macaulays of Uig , although there is no supporting evidence that Óláfr left any descendants on the island .

 = Battle of Greece = 
 The Battle of Greece ( also known as Operation Marita , German : Unternehmen Marita ) is the common name for the invasion of Allied Greece by Nazi Germany in April 1941 during World War II . Concomitant to the stalled Greco @-@ Italian War , it is usually distinguished from the Battle of Crete , which came after mainland Greece had been subdued . These Axis operations were part of the greater Balkan Campaign of Germany . 
 At the time of the German invasion , Greece was at war with Fascist Italy , following the Italian invasion on 28 October 1940 . The Greeks joined the Allies and defeated the initial Italian attack and the counter @-@ attack of March 1941 . When Operation Marita began on 6 April , the bulk of the Greek Army was on the Greek border with Albania , then a protectorate of Italy , from which the Italian troops had attacked . German troops invaded from Bulgaria , creating a second front . Greece had already received a small , inadequate reinforcement from British Empire forces in anticipation of the German attack , but no more help was sent afterward . The Greek army found itself outnumbered in its effort to defend against both Italian and German troops . As a result , the Bulgarian defensive line did not receive adequate troop reinforcements and was quickly overrun by the Germans , who then outflanked the Greek forces at the Albanian border , forcing their surrender . The British Empire forces were overwhelmed and forced to retreat , with the ultimate goal of evacuation . For several days , Allied troops played an important part in containing the German advance on the Thermopylae position , allowing ships to be prepared to evacuate the units defending Greece . The German Army reached the capital , Athens , on 27 April and Greece 's southern shore on 30 April , capturing 7 @,@ 000 British Empire forces and ending the battle with a decisive victory . The conquest of Greece was completed with the capture of Crete a month later . Following its fall , Greece was occupied by the military forces of Germany , Italy and Bulgaria . 
 Hitler later blamed the failure of his invasion of the Soviet Union , which had to be delayed , on Mussolini 's failed conquest of Greece . This explanation for Germany 's calamitous defeat by the Soviet Union has been refuted by the majority of historians , who have accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame for his country 's defeat from himself to his ally , Italy . It nevertheless had serious consequences for the Axis war effort in the North African theatre . <unk> von Rintelen , who was the military attaché in Rome , emphasizes from the German point of view , the strategic mistake of not taking Malta .

 = = = Greco @-@ Italian War = = = 
 At the outbreak of World War II , Ioannis Metaxas — the fascist @-@ style dictator of Greece and former general — sought to maintain a position of neutrality . Greece was subject to increasing pressure from Italy , culminating in the Italian submarine Delfino sinking the cruiser Elli on 15 August 1940 . Italian leader Benito Mussolini was irritated that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler had not consulted him on his war policy and wished to establish his independence . He hoped to match German military success by taking Greece , which he regarded as an easy opponent . On 15 October 1940 , Mussolini and his closest advisers finalised their decision . In the early hours of 28 October , Italian Ambassador Emanuele <unk> presented Metaxas with a three @-@ hour ultimatum , demanding free passage for troops to occupy unspecified " strategic sites " within Greek territory . Metaxas rejected the ultimatum ( the refusal is commemorated as Greek national holiday <unk> Day ) but even before it expired , Italian troops had invaded Greece through Albania . The principal Italian thrust was directed toward Epirus . Hostilities with the Greek army began at the Battle of <unk> – <unk> , where they failed to break the defensive line and were forced to halt . Within three weeks , the Greek army launched a counter @-@ offensive , during which it marched into Albanian territory , capturing significant cities such as <unk> and Sarandë . Neither a change in Italian command nor the arrival of substantial reinforcements improved the position of the Italian army . On 13 February , General Papagos , the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Greek army , opened a new offensive , aiming to take Tepelenë and the port of Vlorë with British air support but the Greek divisions encountered stiff resistance , stalling the offensive that practically destroyed the Cretan 5th Division . 
 After weeks of inconclusive winter warfare , the Italians launched a counter @-@ offensive on the centre of the front on 9 March 1941 , which failed , despite the Italians ' superior forces . After one week and 12 @,@ 000 casualties , Mussolini called off the counter @-@ offensive and left Albania twelve days later . 
 Modern analysts believe that the Italian campaign failed because Mussolini and his generals initially allocated insufficient resources to the campaign ( an expeditionary force of 55 @,@ 000 men ) , failed to reckon with the autumn weather , attacked without the advantage of surprise and without Bulgarian support . Elementary precautions such as issuing winter clothing had not been taken . Mussolini had not considered the warnings of the Italian Commission of War Production , that Italy would not be able to sustain a full year of continuous warfare until 1949 . 
 During the six @-@ month fight against Italy , the Hellenic army made territorial gains by eliminating Italian salients . Greece did not have a substantial armaments industry and its equipment and ammunition supplies increasingly relied on stocks captured by British forces from defeated Italian armies in North Africa . To man the Albanian battlefront , the Greek command was forced to withdraw forces from Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace , because Greek forces could not protect Greece 's entire border . The Greek command decided to support its success in Albania , regardless of the risk of a German attack from the Bulgarian border . 
 = = = Hitler 's decision to attack and British aid to Greece = = = 
 Hitler intervened on 4 November 1940 , four days after British troops arrived at Crete and Lemnos . Although Greece was neutral until the Italian invasion , the British troops that were sent as defensive aid created the possibility of a frontier to the German southern flank . He ordered his Army General Staff to attack Northern Greece from bases in Romania and Bulgaria in support of his master plan to deprive the British of Mediterranean bases . On 12 November , the German Armed Forces High Command issued Directive No. 18 , in which they scheduled simultaneous operations against Gibraltar and Greece for the following January . However , in December 1940 , German ambition in the Mediterranean underwent considerable revision when Spain 's General Francisco Franco rejected the Gibraltar attack . Consequently , Germany 's offensive in southern Europe was restricted to the Greek campaign . The Armed Forces High Command issued Directive No. 20 on 13 December 1940 , outlining the Greek campaign under the code designation Operation Marita . The plan was to occupy the northern coast of the Aegean Sea by March 1941 and to seize the entire Greek mainland , if necessary . During a hasty meeting of Hitler 's staff after the unexpected 27 March Yugoslav coup d 'état against the Yugoslav government , orders for the campaign in Kingdom of Yugoslavia were drafted , as well as changes to the plans for Greece . On 6 April , both Greece and Yugoslavia were to be attacked . 
 Britain was obliged to assist Greece by the Declaration of 1939 , which stated that in the event of a threat to Greek or Romanian independence , " His Majesty 's Government would feel themselves bound at once to lend the Greek or Romanian Government ... all the support in their power . " The first British effort was the deployment of Royal Air Force ( RAF ) squadrons commanded by Air Commodore John D 'Albiac that arrived in November 1940 . With Greek government consent , British forces were dispatched to Crete on 31 October to guard Souda Bay , enabling the Greek government to redeploy the 5th Cretan Division to the mainland . 
 On 17 November 1940 , Metaxas proposed a joint offensive in the Balkans to the British government , with Greek strongholds in southern Albania as the operational base . The British were reluctant to discuss Metaxas ' proposal , because the troops necessary for implementing the Greek plan would seriously endanger operations in North Africa . During a meeting of British and Greek military and political leaders in Athens on 13 January 1941 , General Alexandros Papagos — Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Hellenic Army — asked Britain for nine fully equipped divisions and corresponding air support . The British responded that all they could offer was the immediate dispatch of a token force of less than divisional strength . This offer was rejected by the Greeks , who feared that the arrival of such a contingent would precipitate a German attack without giving them meaningful assistance . British help would be requested if and when German troops crossed the Danube from Romania into Bulgaria .

 Little more than a month later , the British reconsidered . Winston Churchill aspired to recreate a Balkan Front comprising Yugoslavia , Greece and Turkey , and instructed Anthony Eden and Sir John Dill to resume negotiations with the Greek government . A meeting attended by Eden and the Greek leadership , including King George II , Prime Minister Alexandros <unk> — the successor of Metaxas , who had died on 29 January 1941 — and Papagos took place in Athens on 22 February , where they decided to send a British Empire expeditionary force . German troops had been massing in Romania and on 1 March , Wehrmacht forces began to move into Bulgaria . At the same time , the Bulgarian Army mobilised and took up positions along the Greek frontier . 
 On 2 March , Operation Lustre — the transportation of troops and equipment to Greece — began and 26 troopships arrived at the port of Piraeus . On 3 April , during a meeting of British , Yugoslav and Greek military representatives , the Yugoslavs promised to block the Struma valley in case of a German attack across their territory . During this meeting , Papagos stressed the importance of a joint Greco @-@ Yugoslavian offensive against the Italians , as soon as the Germans launched their offensive . By 24 April more than 62 @,@ 000 Empire troops ( British , Australians , New Zealanders , Palestine Pioneer Corps and Cypriots ) , had arrived in Greece , comprising the 6th Australian Division , the New Zealand 2nd Division and the British 1st Armoured Brigade . The three formations later became known as ' W ' Force , after their commander , Lieutenant @-@ General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson . Air Commodore Sir John D 'Albiac commanded British air forces in Greece .

 To enter Northern Greece , the German army had to cross the Rhodope Mountains , which offered few river valleys or mountain passes capable of accommodating the movement of large military units . Two invasion courses were located west of Kyustendil ; another was along the Yugoslav @-@ Bulgarian border , via the Struma river valley to the south . Greek border fortifications had been adapted for the terrain and a formidable defence system covered the few available roads . The Struma and Nestos rivers cut across the mountain range along the Greek @-@ Bulgarian frontier and both of their valleys were protected by strong fortifications , as part of the larger Metaxas Line . This system of concrete pillboxes and field fortifications , constructed along the Bulgarian border in the late 1930s , was built on principles similar to those of the Maginot Line . Its strength resided mainly in the inaccessibility of the intermediate terrain leading up to the defence positions . 
 = = = Strategy = = = 
 Greece 's mountainous terrain favored a defensive strategy and the high ranges of the Rhodope , Epirus , Pindus and Olympus mountains offered many defensive opportunities . However , air power was required to protect defending ground forces from entrapment in the many defiles . Although an invading force from Albania could be stopped by a relatively small number of troops positioned in the high Pindus mountains , the northeastern part of the country was difficult to defend against an attack from the north . 
 Following a March conference in Athens , the British believed that they would combine with Greek forces to occupy the Haliacmon Line — a short front facing north @-@ eastwards along the <unk> Mountains and the lower Haliacmon river . Papagos awaited clarification from the Yugoslav government and later proposed to hold the Metaxas Line — by then a symbol of national security to the Greek populace — and not withdraw divisions from Albania . He argued that to do so would be seen as a concession to the Italians . The strategically important port of Thessaloniki lay practically undefended and transportation of British troops to the city remained dangerous . Papagos proposed to take advantage of the area 's terrain and prepare fortifications , while also protecting Thessaloniki . 
 General Dill described Papagos ' attitude as " unaccommodating and defeatist " and argued that his plan ignored the fact that Greek troops and artillery were capable of only token resistance . The British believed that the Greek rivalry with Bulgaria — the Metaxas Line was designed specifically for war with Bulgaria — as well as their traditionally good terms with the Yugoslavs — left their north @-@ western border largely undefended . Despite their awareness that the line was likely to collapse in the event of a German thrust from the Struma and Axios rivers , the British eventually acceded to the Greek command . On 4 March , Dill accepted the plans for the Metaxas line and on 7 March agreement was ratified by the British Cabinet . The overall command was to be retained by Papagos and the Greek and British commands agreed to fight a delaying action in the north @-@ east . The British did not move their troops , because General Wilson regarded them as too weak to protect such a broad front . Instead , he took a position some 40 miles ( 64 kilometres ) west of the Axios , across the Haliacmon Line . The two main objectives in establishing this position were to maintain contact with the Hellenic army in Albania and to deny German access to Central Greece . This had the advantage of requiring a smaller force than other options , while allowing more preparation time . However , it meant abandoning nearly the whole of Northern Greece , which was unacceptable to the Greeks for political and psychological reasons . Moreover , the line 's left flank was susceptible to flanking from Germans operating through the Monastir Gap in Yugoslavia . However , the rapid disintegration of the Yugoslav Army and a German thrust into the rear of the Vermion position was not expected . 
 The German strategy was based on using so @-@ called " blitzkrieg " methods that had proved successful during the invasions of Western Europe . Their effectiveness was confirmed during the invasion of Yugoslavia . The German command again coupled ground troops and armour with air support and rapidly drove into the territory . Once Thessaloniki was captured , Athens and the port of Piraeus became principal targets . Piraeus , was virtually destroyed by bombing on the night of the 6 / 7 April . The loss of Piraeus and the Isthmus of Corinth would fatally compromise withdrawal and evacuation of British and Greek forces . 
 = = = Defence and attack forces = = = 
 The Fifth Yugoslav Army took responsibility for the south @-@ eastern border between <unk> Palanka and the Greek border . However , the Yugoslav troops were not fully mobilised and lacked adequate equipment and weapons . Following the entry of German forces into Bulgaria , the majority of Greek troops were evacuated from Western Thrace . By this time , Greek forces defending the Bulgarian border totaled roughly 70 @,@ 000 men ( sometimes labeled the " Greek Second Army " in English and German sources , although no such formation existed ) . The remainder of the Greek forces — 14 divisions ( often erroneously referred to as the " Greek First Army " by foreign sources ) — was committed in Albania . 
 On 28 March , the Greek Central Macedonia Army Section — comprising the 12th and 20th Infantry Divisions — were put under the command of General Wilson , who established his headquarters to the north @-@ west of Larissa . The New Zealand division took position north of Mount Olympus , while the Australian division blocked the Haliacmon valley up to the Vermion range . The RAF continued to operate from airfields in Central and Southern Greece ; however , few planes could be diverted to the theater . The British forces were near to fully motorised , but their equipment was more suited to desert warfare than to Greece 's steep mountain roads . They were short of tanks and anti @-@ aircraft guns and the lines of communication across the Mediterranean were vulnerable , because each convoy had to pass close to Axis @-@ held islands in the Aegean ; despite the British Royal Navy 's domination of the Aegean Sea . These logistical problems were aggravated by the limited availability of shipping and Greek port capacity . 
 The German Twelfth Army — under the command of Field Marshal Wilhelm List — was charged with the execution of Operation Marita . His army was composed of six units : 
 First Panzer Group , under the command of General Ewald von Kleist . 
 XL Panzer Corps , under Lieutenant General Georg Stumme . 
 XVIII Mountain Corps , under Lieutenant General Franz Böhme . 
 XXX Infantry Corps , under Lieutenant General Otto Hartmann . 
 L Infantry Corps , under Lieutenant General Georg Lindemann . 
 16th Panzer Division , deployed behind the Turkish @-@ Bulgarian border to support the Bulgarian forces in case of a Turkish attack . 
 = = = German plan of attack and assembly = = = 
 The German plan of attack was influenced by their army 's experiences during the Battle of France . Their strategy was to create a diversion through the campaign in Albania , thus stripping the Hellenic Army of manpower for the defence of their Yugoslavian and Bulgarian borders . By driving armoured wedges through the weakest links of the defence chain , penetrating Allied territory would not require substantial armour behind an infantry advance . Once Southern Yugoslavia was overrun by German armour , the Metaxas Line could be outflanked by highly mobile forces thrusting southward from Yugoslavia . Thus , possession of Monastir and the Axios valley leading to Thessaloniki became essential for such an outflanking maneuver . 
 The Yugoslav coup d 'état led to a sudden change in the plan of attack and confronted the Twelfth Army with a number of difficult problems . According to the 28 March Directive No. 25 , the Twelfth Army was to create a mobile task force to attack via Niš toward Belgrade . With only nine days left before their final deployment , every hour became valuable and each fresh assembly of troops took time to mobilise . By the evening of 5 April , the forces intended to enter southern Yugoslavia and Greece had been assembled . 
 = = German invasion = = 
 = = = Thrust across southern Yugoslavia and the drive to Thessaloniki = = = 
 At dawn on 6 April , the German armies invaded Greece , while the Luftwaffe began an intensive bombardment of Belgrade . The XL Panzer Corps — planned to attack across southern Yugoslavia — began their assault at 05 : 30 . They pushed across the Bulgarian frontier at two separate points . By the evening of 8 April , the 73rd Infantry Division captured Prilep , severing an important rail line between Belgrade and Thessaloniki and isolating Yugoslavia from its allies . On the evening of 9 April , Stumme deployed his forces north of Monastir , in preparation for attack toward Florina . This position threatened to encircle the Greeks in Albania and W Force in the area of Florina , Edessa and Katerini . While weak security detachments covered his rear against a surprise attack from central Yugoslavia , elements of the 9th Panzer Division drove westward to link up with the Italians at the Albanian border . 
 The 2nd Panzer Division ( XVIII Mountain Corps ) entered Yugoslavia from the east on the morning of 6 April and advanced westward through the Struma Valley . It encountered little resistance , but was delayed by road clearance demolitions , mines and mud . Nevertheless , the division was able to reach the day 's objective , the town of Strumica . On 7 April , a Yugoslav counter @-@ attack against the division 's northern flank was repelled , and the following day , the division forced its way across the mountains and overran the thinly manned defensive line of the Greek 19th Mechanized Division south of Doiran Lake . Despite many delays along the mountain roads , an armoured advance guard dispatched toward Thessaloniki succeeded in entering the city by the morning of 9 April . Thessaloniki was taken after a long battle with three Greek divisions under the command of General Bakopoulos , and was followed by the surrender of the Greek Eastern Macedonia Army Section , taking effect at 13 : 00 on 10 April . In the three days it took the Germans to reach Thessaloniki and breach the Metaxas Line , some 60 @,@ 000 Greek soldiers were taken prisoner . The British and Commonwealth forces then took over the defence of Greece , with the bulk of the Greek Army fighting to maintain their old positions in Albania . 
 = = = Greek @-@ Yugoslav counteroffensive = = = 
 In early April 1941 , Greek , Yugoslav and British commanders met to set in motion a counteroffensive , that planned to completely destroy the Italian army in Albania in time to counter the German invasion and allow the bulk of the Greek army to take up new positions and protect the border with Yugoslavia and Bulgaria . On 7 April , the Yugoslav 3rd Army in the form of five infantry divisions ( 13th " <unk> " , 15th " Zetska " , 25th " <unk> " , 31st " Kosovska " and 12th " Jadranska " Divisions , with the " Jadranska " acting as the reserve ) , after a false start due to the planting of a bogus order , launched a counteroffensive in northern Albania , advancing from Debar , <unk> and Podgorica towards Elbasan . On 8 April , the Yugoslav vanguard , the " <unk> " Cavalry Regiment crossed the treacherous <unk> Mountains and captured the village of <unk> in the <unk> River Valley , and the 31st " Kosovska " Division , supported by Savoia @-@ Marchetti <unk> bombers from the 7th Bomber Regiment of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force ( VVKJ ) , broke through the Italian positions in the Drin River Valley . The " <unk> " Division , due to the fall of Skopje was forced to halt its operations in Albania . In the meantime , the Western Macedonia Army Section under General Tsolakoglou , comprising the 9th and 13th Greek Divisions , advanced in support of the Royal Yugoslav Army , capturing some 250 Italians on 8 April . The Greeks were tasked with advancing towards Durrës . On 9 April , the Zetska Division advanced towards Shkodër and the Yugoslav cavalry regiment reached the Drin River , but the Kosovska Division had to halt its advance due to the appearance of German units near Prizren . The Yugoslav @-@ Greek offensive was supported by <unk> bombers from the 66th and 81st Bomber Groups of the VVKJ , that attacked airfields and camps around Shkodër , as well as the port of Durrës , and Italian troop concentrations and bridges on the Drin and <unk> rivers and Durrës , Tirana and Zara . 
 Between 11 – 13 April 1941 , with German and Italian troops advancing on its rear areas , the Zetska Division was forced to retreat back to the <unk> River by the Italian 131st Armoured Division Centauro , where it remained until the end of the campaign on 16 April . The Italian armoured division along with the 18th Infantry Division Messina then advanced upon the Yugoslav fleet base of Kotor in Montenegro , also occupying <unk> and Podgorica . The Yugoslavs lost 30 @,@ 000 men captured in the Italian counterattacks . 
 = = = Metaxas Line = = = 
 The Metaxas Line was defended by the Eastern Macedonia Army Section ( Lieutenant General Konstantinos Bakopoulos ) , comprising the 7th , 14th and 18th Infantry divisions . The line ran for about 170 km ( 110 mi ) along the river Nestos to the east and then further east , following the Bulgarian border as far as Mount <unk> near the Yugoslav border . The fortifications were designed to garrison over 200 @,@ 000 troops but there were only about 70 @,@ 000 and the infantry garrison was thinly spread . Some 950 men under the command of Major George <unk> of <unk> Division ( Major @-@ General Konstantinos <unk> ) defended Fort Rupel . 
 The Germans had to break the line to capture Thessaloniki , Greece 's second @-@ largest city , with a strategically @-@ important port . The attack started on 6 April with one infantry unit and two divisions of the XVIII Mountain Corps . Due to strong resistance , the first day of the attack yielded little progress in breaking the line . A German report at the end of the first day described how the German 5th Mountain Division " was repulsed in the Rupel Pass despite strongest air support and sustained considerable casualties " . Two German battalions managed to get within 600 ft ( 180 m ) of Fort Rupel on 6 April , but were practically destroyed . Of the 24 forts that made up the Metaxas Line , only two had fallen and then only after they had been destroyed . In the following days , the Germans pummelled the forts with artillery and dive bombers and reinforced the 125th Infantry Regiment . A 7 @,@ 000 ft ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) high snow @-@ covered mountainous passage considered inaccessible by the Greeks was crossed by the 6th Mountain Division , which reached the rail line to Thessaloniki on the evening of 7 April . 
 The 5th Mountain Division , together with the reinforced 125th Infantry Regiment , crossed the Struma river under great hardship , attacking along both banks and clearing bunkers until they reached their objective on 7 April . Heavy casualties caused them to temporarily withdraw . The 72nd Infantry Division advanced from <unk> across the mountains . Its advance was delayed by a shortage of pack animals , medium artillery and mountain equipment . Only on the evening of 9 April did it reach the area north @-@ east of Serres . Most fortresses — like Fort <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> — held until the Germans occupied Thessaloniki on 9 April , at which point they surrendered under General Bakopoulos ' orders . Nevertheless , minor isolated fortresses continued to fight for a few days more and were not taken until heavy artillery was used against them . This gave time for some retreating troops to evacuate by sea . Although eventually broken , the defenders of the Metaxas Line succeeded in delaying the German <unk> Metaxas Line , requiring 150 @,@ 000 men , could have held out longer , but the bulk of the Greek army was facing the Italians in Albania . 
 = = = Capitulation of the Hellenic army in Macedonia = = = 
 The XXX Infantry Corps on the left wing reached its designated objective on the evening of 8 April , when the 164th Infantry Division captured Xanthi . The 50th Infantry Division advanced far beyond Komotini towards the Nestos river . Both divisions arrived the next day . On 9 April , the Greek forces defending the Metaxas Line capitulated unconditionally following the collapse of Greek resistance east of the Axios river . In a 9 April estimate of the situation , Field Marshal List commented that as a result of the swift advance of the mobile units , his 12th Army was now in a favorable position to access central Greece by breaking the Greek build @-@ up behind the Axios river . On the basis of this estimate , List requested the transfer of the 5th Panzer Division from First Panzer Group to the XL Panzer Corps . He reasoned that its presence would give additional punch to the German thrust through the Monastir Gap . For the continuation of the campaign , he formed an eastern group under the command of XVIII Mountain Corps and a western group led by XL Panzer Corps . 
 = = = Breakthrough to Kozani = = = 
 By the morning of 10 April , the XL Panzer Corps had finished its preparations for the continuation of the offensive and advanced in the direction of Kozani . The 5th Panzer Division , advancing from Skopje encountered a Greek division tasked with defending Monastir Gap , rapidly defeating the defenders . First contact with Allied troops was made north of Vevi at 11 : 00 on 10 April . German SS troops seized Vevi on 11 April , but were stopped at the <unk> Pass just south of town , where a mixed Empire @-@ Greek formation — known as Mackay Force — was assembled to , as Wilson put it , " ... stop a blitzkrieg down the Florina valley . " During the next day , the SS regiment reconnoitered the Allied positions and at dusk launched a frontal attack against the pass . Following heavy fighting , the Germans broke through the defence . On 13 April , 70 supporting German bombers attacked Volos , the port almost being completely destroyed . By the morning of 14 April , the spearheads of the 9th Panzer Division reached Kozani . 
 = = = Olympus and Servia passes = = = 
 Wilson faced the prospect of being pinned by Germans operating from Thessaloniki , while being flanked by the German XL Panzer Corps descending through the Monastir Gap . On 13 April , he withdrew all British forces to the Haliacmon river and then to the narrow pass at Thermopylae . On 14 April , the 9th Panzer Division established a bridgehead across the Haliacmon river , but an attempt to advance beyond this point was stopped by intense Allied fire . This defence had three main components : the Platamon tunnel area between Olympus and the sea , the Olympus pass itself and the Servia pass to the south @-@ east . By channeling the attack through these three defiles , the new line offered far greater defensive strength . The defences of the Olympus and Servia passes consisted of the 4th New Zealand Brigade , 5th New Zealand Brigade and the 16th Australian Brigade . For the next three days , the advance of the 9th Panzer Division was stalled in front of these resolutely held positions . 
 A ruined castle dominated the ridge across which the coastal pass led to Platamon . During the night of April 15 , a German motorcycle battalion supported by a tank battalion attacked the ridge , but the Germans were repulsed by the New Zealand 21st Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Neil Macky , which suffered heavy losses in the process . Later that day , a German armoured regiment arrived and struck the coastal and inland flanks of the battalion , but the New Zealanders held . After being reinforced during the night of the 15th – 16th , the Germans assembled a tank battalion , an infantry battalion and a motorcycle battalion . The infantry attacked the New Zealanders ' left company at dawn , while the tanks attacked along the coast several hours <unk> New Zealanders soon found themselves enveloped on both sides , after the failure of the Western Macedonia Army to defend the Albanian town of <unk> that fell unopposed to the Italian 9th Army on 15 April , forcing the British to abandon the Mount Olympus position and resulting in the capture of 20 @,@ 000 Greek troops . 
 The New Zealand battalion withdrew , crossing the Pineios river ; by dusk , they had reached the western exit of the Pineios Gorge , suffering only light casualties . Macky was informed that it was " essential to deny the gorge to the enemy until 19 April even if it meant extinction " . He sank a crossing barge at the western end of the gorge once all his men were across and set up defences . The 21st Battalion was reinforced by the Australian 2 / 2nd Battalion and later by the 2 / 3rd . This force became known as " Allen force " after Brigadier " Tubby " Allen . The 2 / 5th and 2 / 11th battalions moved to the <unk> area south @-@ west of the gorge and were ordered to hold the western exit possibly for three or four days . 
 On 16 April , Wilson met Papagos at Lamia and informed him of his decision to withdraw to Thermopylae . Lieutenant @-@ General Thomas Blamey divided responsibility between generals Mackay and Freyberg during the leapfrogging move to Thermopylae . Mackay 's force was assigned the flanks of the New Zealand Division as far south as an east @-@ west line through Larissa and to oversee the withdrawal through Domokos to Thermopylae of the Savige and <unk> Forces and finally of Lee Force ; Brigadier Harold Charrington 's 1st Armoured Brigade was to cover the withdrawal of Savige Force to Larissa and thereafter the withdrawal of the 6th Division under whose command it would come ; overseeing the withdrawal of Allen Force which was to move along the same route as the New Zealand Division . The British Empire forces remained under attack throughout the withdrawal . 
 On the morning of 18 April , the Battle of Tempe Gorge , the struggle for the Pineios Gorge , was over when German armoured infantry crossed the river on floats and 6th Mountain Division troops worked their way around the New Zealand battalion , which was subsequently dispersed . On 19 April , the first XVIII Mountain Corps troops entered Larissa and took possession of the airfield , where the British had left their supply dump intact . The seizure of ten truckloads of rations and fuel enabled the spearhead units to continue without ceasing . The port of Volos , at which the British had re @-@ embarked numerous units during the prior few days , fell on 21 April ; there , the Germans captured large quantities of valuable diesel and crude oil . 
 = = = Withdrawal and surrender of the Greek Epirus Army = = = 
 As the invading Germans advanced deep into Greek territory , the Epirus Army Section of the Greek army operating in Albania was reluctant to retreat . However , by the middle of March , especially after the <unk> offensive , the Greek army had suffered , according to British estimates , 5 @,@ 000 casualties . The Italian offensive revealed a " chronic shortage of arms and equipment . " The Greeks were fast approaching the end of their logistical tether . 
 General Wilson described this unwillingness to retreat as " the fetishistic doctrine that not a yard of ground should be yielded to the Italians . " Churchill also criticized the Greek Army commanders for ignoring British advice to abandon Albania and avoid encirclement . Lieutenant @-@ General George Stumme 's Fortieth Corps captured the Florina @-@ Vevi Pass on 11 April , but unseasonal snowy weather then halted his advance . On 12 April , he resumed the advance , but spent the whole day fighting Brigadier Charrington 's 1st Armoured Brigade at <unk> . It was not until 13 April that the first Greek elements began to withdraw toward the Pindus mountains . The Allies ' retreat to Thermopylae uncovered a route across the Pindus mountains by which the Germans might flank the Hellenic army in a rearguard action . An elite SS formation — the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade — was assigned the mission of cutting off the Greek Epirus Army 's line of retreat from Albania by driving westward to the Metsovon pass and from there to Ioannina . On 13 April , attack aircraft from 21 , 23 and 33 Squadrons from the Hellenic Air Force ( <unk> ) , attacked Italian positions in Albania . That same day , heavy fighting took place at <unk> pass , where the Greek 20th Division covering the Greek withdrawal , fought in a determined manner , delaying Stumme 's advance practically a whole day . The withdrawal extended across the entire Albanian front , with the Italians in hesitant pursuit . On 15 April , Regia Aeronautica fighters attacked the ( <unk> ) base at <unk> , 30 miles south of Greece 's border with Albania , destroying or putting out of action 17 VVKJ aircraft that had recently arrived from Yugoslavia . 
 General Papagos rushed Greek units to the Metsovon pass where the Germans were expected to attack . On 14 April a pitched battle between several Greek units and the LSSAH brigade — which had by then reached Grevena — erupted . The Greek 13th and Cavalry Divisions lacked the equipment necessary to fight against an armoured unit but nevertheless fought on till the next day , when the defenders were finally encircled and overwhelmed . On 18 April , General Wilson in a meeting with Papagos , informed him that the British and Commonwealth forces at <unk> would carry on fighting till the first week of May , providing that Greek forces from Albania could redeploy and cover the left flank . On 21 April , the Germans advanced further and captured Ioannina , the final supply route of the Greek Epirus Army . Allied newspapers dubbed the Hellenic army 's fate a modern @-@ day Greek tragedy . Historian and former war @-@ correspondent Christopher Buckley — when describing the fate of the Hellenic army — stated that " one experience [ d ] a genuine Aristotelian catharsis , an awe @-@ inspiring sense of the futility of all human effort and all human courage . " 
 On 20 April , the commander of Greek forces in Albania — General Georgios Tsolakoglou — accepted the hopelessness of the situation and offered to surrender his army , which then consisted of fourteen divisions . Generals Ioannis <unk> and Georgios <unk> had already warned General Papagos on 14 April that morale in the Epirus Army was wearing thin , and regrettably combat stress and exhaustion had resulted in officers taking the decision to put deserters before firing squads . Nevertheless , Papagos condemned Tsolakoglou for his decision to not continue fighting . General Blamey also criticized at the time , Tsolakoglou 's decision to surrender without permission from General Papagos . Historian John Keegan writes that Tsolakoglou " was so determined ... to deny the Italians the satisfaction of a victory they had not earned that ... he opened [ a ] quite unauthorised parley with the commander of the German SS division opposite him , Sepp Dietrich , to arrange a surrender to the Germans alone . " On strict orders from Hitler , negotiations were kept secret from the Italians and the surrender was accepted . Outraged by this decision , Mussolini ordered counter @-@ attacks against the Greek forces , which were repulsed , but at some cost to the defenders . The Germans Air Force intervened in the renewed fighting , and Ioannina was practically destroyed by Stukas . It took a personal representation from Mussolini to Hitler to organize Italian participation in the armistice that was concluded on 23 April . Greek soldiers were not rounded up as prisoners of war and were allowed instead to go home after the demobilisation of their units , while their officers were permitted to retain their side arms . 
 = = = Thermopylae position = = = 
 As early as 16 April , the German command realised that the British were evacuating troops on ships at Volos and Piraeus . The campaign then took on the character of a pursuit . For the Germans , it was now primarily a question of maintaining contact with the retreating British forces and foiling their evacuation plans . German infantry divisions were withdrawn due to its limited mobility . The 2nd and 5th Panzer Divisions , the 1st SS Motorised Infantry Regiment and both mountain divisions launched a pursuit of the Allied forces . 
 To allow an evacuation of the main body of British forces , Wilson ordered the rearguard to make a last stand at the historic Thermopylae pass , the gateway to Athens . General Freyberg 's 2nd New Zealand Division was given the task of defending the coastal pass , while Mackay 's 6th Australian Division was to hold the village of <unk> . After the battle Mackay was quoted as saying " I did not dream of evacuation ; I thought that we 'd hang on for about a fortnight and be beaten by weight of numbers . " When the order to retreat was received on the morning of 23 April , it was decided that the two positions were to be held by one brigade each . These brigades , the 19th Australian and 6th New Zealand were to hold the passes as long as possible , allowing the other units to withdraw . The Germans attacked at 11 : 30 on 24 April , met fierce resistance , lost 15 tanks and sustained considerable casualties . The Allies held out the entire day ; with the delaying action accomplished , they retreated in the direction of the evacuation beaches and set up another rearguard at Thebes . The Panzer units launching a pursuit along the road leading across the pass made slow progress because of the steep gradient and difficult hairpin bends . 
 = = = German drive on Athens = = = 
 After abandoning the Thermopylae area , the British rearguard withdrew to an improvised switch position south of Thebes , where they erected a last obstacle in front of Athens . The motorcycle battalion of the 2nd Panzer Division , which had crossed to the island of Euboea to seize the port of Chalcis and had subsequently returned to the mainland , was given the mission of outflanking the British rearguard . The motorcycle troops encountered only slight resistance and on the morning of 27 April 1941 , the first Germans entered Athens , followed by armoured cars , tanks and infantry . They captured intact large quantities of petroleum , oil and lubricants ( " POL " ) , several thousand tons of ammunition , ten trucks loaded with sugar and ten truckloads of other rations in addition to various other equipment , weapons and medical supplies . The people of Athens had been expecting the Germans for several days and confined themselves to their homes with their windows shut . The previous night , Athens Radio had made the following announcement : 
 You are listening to the voice of Greece . Greeks , stand firm , proud and dignified . You must prove yourselves worthy of your history . The valor and victory of our army has already been recognised . The righteousness of our cause will also be recognised . We did our duty honestly . Friends ! Have Greece in your hearts , live inspired with the fire of her latest triumph and the glory of our army . Greece will live again and will be great , because she fought honestly for a just cause and for freedom . Brothers ! Have courage and patience . Be stout hearted . We will overcome these hardships . Greeks ! With Greece in your minds you must be proud and dignified . We have been an honest nation and brave soldiers . 
 The Germans drove straight to the Acropolis and raised the Nazi flag . According to the most popular account of the events , the <unk> soldier on guard duty , Konstantinos <unk> , took down the Greek flag , refusing to hand it to the invaders , wrapped himself in it , and jumped off the Acropolis . Whether the story was true or not , many Greeks believed it and viewed the soldier as a martyr . 
 = = = Evacuation of Empire forces = = = 
 General Archibald Wavell , the commander of British Army forces in the Middle East , when in Greece from 11 – 13 April had warned Wilson that he must expect no reinforcements and had authorised Major General Freddie de Guingand to discuss evacuation plans with certain responsible officers . Nevertheless , the British could not at this stage adopt or even mention this course of action ; the suggestion had to come from the Greek Government . The following day , Papagos made the first move when he suggested to Wilson that W Force be withdrawn . Wilson informed Middle East Headquarters and on 17 April , Rear admiral H. T. Baillie @-@ Grohman was sent to Greece to prepare for the evacuation . That day Wilson hastened to Athens where he attended a conference with the King , Papagos , d 'Albiac and Rear admiral <unk> . In the evening , after telling the King that he felt he had failed him in the task entrusted to him , Prime Minister <unk> committed suicide . On 21 April , the final decision to evacuate Empire forces to Crete and Egypt was taken and Wavell — in confirmation of verbal instructions — sent his written orders to Wilson . 
 5 200 men , mostly from the 5th New Zealand Brigade , were evacuated on the night of 24 April , from Porto Rafti of East Attica , while the 4th New Zealand Brigade remained to block the narrow road to Athens , dubbed the 24 Hour Pass by the New Zealanders . On 25 April ( Anzac Day ) , the few RAF squadrons left Greece ( D 'Albiac established his headquarters in Heraklion , Crete ) and some 10 @,@ 200 Australian troops evacuated from Nafplio and Megara . 2 @,@ 000 more men had to wait until 27 April , because Ulster Prince ran aground in shallow waters close to Nafplio . Because of this event , the Germans realised that the evacuation was also taking place from the ports of the eastern Peloponnese . 
 The Greek Navy and Merchant Marine played an important part in the evacuation of the Allied forces to Crete and suffered heavy losses as a result . 
 On 25 April the Germans staged an airborne operation to seize the bridges over the Corinth canal , with the double aim of cutting off the British line of retreat and securing their own way across the isthmus . The attack met with initial success , until a stray British shell destroyed the bridge . The 1st SS Motorised Infantry Regiment ( " LSSAH " ) , assembled at Ioannina , thrust along the western foothills of the Pindus Mountains via Arta to Missolonghi and crossed over to the Peloponnese at Patras in an effort to gain access to the isthmus from the west . Upon their arrival at 17 : 30 on 27 April , the SS forces learned that the paratroops had already been relieved by Army units advancing from Athens . 
 The Dutch troop ship Slamat was part of a convoy evacuating about 3 @,@ 000 British , Australian and New Zealand troops from Nafplio in the Peloponnese . As the convoy headed south in the Argolic Gulf on the morning of 27 April , it was attacked by a Staffel of nine Junkers Ju 87s of Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 , damaging Slamat and setting her on fire . The destroyer HMS Diamond rescued about 600 survivors and HMS Wryneck came to her aid , but as the two destroyers headed for Souda Bay in Crete another Ju 87 attack sank them both . The total number of deaths from the three sinkings was almost 1 @,@ 000 . Only 27 crew from Wryneck , 20 crew from Diamond , 11 crew and eight evacuated soldiers from Slamat survived . 
 The erection of a temporary bridge across the Corinth canal permitted 5th Panzer Division units to pursue the Allied forces across the Peloponnese . Driving via Argos to Kalamata , from where most Allied units had already begun to evacuate , they reached the south coast on 29 April , where they were joined by SS troops arriving from Pyrgos . The fighting on the Peloponnese consisted of small @-@ scale engagements with isolated groups of British troops who had been unable to reach the evacuation point . The attack came days too late to cut off the bulk of the British troops in Central Greece , but isolated the Australian 16th and 17th Brigades . By 30 April the evacuation of about 50 @,@ 000 soldiers was completed , but was heavily contested by the German Luftwaffe , which sank at least 26 troop @-@ laden ships . The Germans captured around 8 @,@ 000 Empire ( including 2 @,@ 000 Cypriot and Palestinian ) and Yugoslav troops in Kalamata who had not been evacuated , while liberating many Italian prisoners from POW camps .

 = = = Triple occupation = = = 
 On 13 April 1941 , Hitler issued Directive No. 27 , including his occupation policy for Greece . He finalized jurisdiction in the Balkans with Directive No. 31 issued on 9 June . Mainland Greece was divided between Germany , Italy and Bulgaria , with Italy occupying the bulk of the country ( see map opposite ) . German forces occupied the strategically more important areas of Athens , Thessaloniki , Central Macedonia and several Aegean islands , including most of Crete . They also occupied Florina , which was claimed by both Italy and Bulgaria . Bulgaria , which had not participated in the invasion of Greece , occupied most of Thrace on the same day that Tsolakoglou offered his surrender . The goal was to gain an Aegean Sea outlet in Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia . The Bulgarians occupied territory between the Struma river and a line of demarcation running through Alexandroupoli and <unk> west of the Evros River . Italian troops started occupying the Ionian and Aegean islands on 28 April . On 2 June , they occupied the Peloponnese ; on 8 June , Thessaly ; and on 12 June , most of Attica . The occupation of Greece — during which civilians suffered terrible hardships , many dying from privation and hunger — proved to be a difficult and costly task . Several resistance groups launched guerrilla attacks against the occupying forces and set up espionage networks . 
 = = = Battle of Crete = = = 
 On 25 April 1941 , King George II and his government left the Greek mainland for Crete , which was attacked by Nazi forces on 20 May 1941 . The Germans employed parachute forces in a massive airborne invasion and attacked the three main airfields of the island in Maleme , Rethymno and Heraklion . After seven days of fighting and tough resistance , Allied commanders decided that the cause was hopeless and ordered a withdrawal from Sfakia . By 1 June 1941 , the evacuation was complete and the island was under German occupation . In light of the heavy casualties suffered by the elite 7th Fliegerdivision , Hitler forbade further airborne operations . General Kurt Student would dub Crete " the graveyard of the German paratroopers " and a " disastrous victory . " During the night of 24 May , George II and his government were evacuated from Crete to Egypt .

 The Greek campaign ended with a complete German and Italian victory . The British did not have the military resources to carry out big simultaneous operations in North Africa and the Balkans . Moreover , even had they been able to block the Axis advance , they would have been unable to exploit the situation by a counter @-@ thrust across the Balkans . The British came very near to holding Crete and perhaps other islands that would have provided air support for naval operations throughout the eastern Mediterranean . 
 In enumerating the reasons for the complete Axis victory in Greece , the following factors were of greatest significance : 
 Germany superiority in ground forces and equipment ; 
 The bulk of the Greek army was occupied fighting the Italians on the Albanian front . 
 German air supremacy combined with the inability of the Greeks to provide the RAF with adequate airfields ; 
 Inadequacy of British expeditionary forces , since the Imperial force available was small ; 
 Poor condition of the Hellenic Army and its shortages of modern equipment ; 
 Inadequate port , road and railway facilities ; 
 Absence of a unified command and lack of cooperation between the British , Greek and Yugoslav forces ; 
 Turkey 's strict neutrality ; and 
 The early collapse of Yugoslav resistance . 
 = = = Criticism of British actions = = = 
 After the Allies ' defeat , the decision to send British forces into Greece faced fierce criticism in Britain . Field Marshal Alan Brooke , Chief of the Imperial General Staff during World War II , considered intervention in Greece to be " a definite strategic blunder " , as it denied Wavell the necessary reserves to complete the conquest of Italian Libya , or to withstand Erwin Rommel 's Afrika Korps March offensive . It prolonged the North African Campaign , which might have been concluded during 1941 . 
 In 1947 , de Guingand asked the British government to recognise its mistaken strategy in Greece . Buckley countered that if Britain had not honored its 1939 commitment to Greece , it would have severely damaged the ethical basis of its struggle against Nazi Germany . According to Heinz Richter , Churchill tried through the campaign in Greece , to influence the political atmosphere in the United States and insisted on this strategy even after the defeat . According to Keegan , " the Greek campaign had been an old @-@ fashioned gentlemen 's war , with honor given and accepted by brave adversaries on each side " and the vastly outnumbered Greek and Allied forces , " had , rightly , the sensation of having fought the good fight " . It has also been suggested the British strategy was to create a barrier in Greece , to protect Turkey , the only ( neutral ) country standing between an Axis block in the Balkans and the oil @-@ rich Middle East but the British intervention in Greece was considered a fiasco . Martin van Creveld believes that the British did everything in their power to scuttle all attempts at a separate peace between the Greeks and the Italians , to keep the Greeks fighting so as to draw Italian divisions away from North Africa . 
 Freyberg and Blamey also had serious doubts about the feasibility of the operation but failed to express their reservations and apprehensions . The campaign caused a furore in Australia , when it became known that when General Blamey received his first warning of the move to Greece on 18 February 1941 , he was worried but had not informed the Australian Government . He had been told by Wavell that Prime Minister Menzies had approved the plan . The proposal had been accepted by a meeting of the War Cabinet in London at which Menzies was present but the Australian Prime Minister had been told by Churchill that both Freyberg and Blamey approved of the expedition . On 5 March , in a letter to Menzies , Blamey said that " the plan is , of course , what I feared : piecemeal dispatch to Europe " and the next day he called the operation " most hazardous " . Thinking that he was agreeable , the Australian Government had already committed the Australian Imperial Force to the Greek Campaign . 
 = = = Impact on Operation Barbarossa = = = 
 In 1942 , members of the British Parliament characterised the campaign in Greece as a " political and sentimental decision " . Eden rejected the criticism and argued that the UK 's decision was unanimous and asserted that the Battle of Greece delayed Operation Barbarossa , the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union . This is an argument that historians such as Keegan used to assert that Greek resistance was a turning point in World War II . According to film @-@ maker and friend of Adolf Hitler Leni Riefenstahl , Hitler said that " if the Italians hadn 't attacked Greece and needed our help , the war would have taken a different course . We could have anticipated the Russian cold by weeks and conquered Leningrad and Moscow . There would have been no Stalingrad " . Despite his reservations , Brooke seems also to have conceded that the Balkan Campaign delayed the offensive against the Soviet Union . 
 Bradley and Buell conclude that " although no single segment of the Balkan campaign forced the Germans to delay Barbarossa , obviously the entire campaign did prompt them to wait . " On the other hand , Richter calls Eden 's arguments a " falsification of history " . Basil Liddell Hart and de Guingand point out that the delay of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union was not among Britain 's strategic goals and as a result the possibility of such a delay could not have affected its decisions about Operation Marita . In 1952 , the Historical Branch of the UK Cabinet Office concluded that the Balkan Campaign had no influence on the launching of Operation Barbarossa . According to Robert <unk> , " the main causes for deferring Barbarossa 's start from 15 May to 22 June were incomplete logistical arrangements and an unusually wet winter that kept rivers at full flood until late spring . " This however does not answer whether in the absence of these problems the campaign could have begun according to the original plan . Keegan writes : 
 In the aftermath , historians would measure its significance in terms of the delay Marita had or had not imposed on the unleashing of Barbarossa , an exercise ultimately to be judged profitless , since it was the Russian weather , not the contingencies of subsidiary campaigns , which determined Barbarossa 's launch date . 
 = Eragon = 
 Eragon is the first novel in the Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini . After writing the first draft for a year , Paolini spent a second year rewriting and fleshing out the story and characters . Paolini 's parents saw the final manuscript and decided to self @-@ publish Eragon . Paolini spent a year traveling around the United States promoting the novel . By chance , the book was discovered by Carl Hiaasen , who got it re @-@ published by Alfred A. Knopf . The re @-@ published version was released on August 26 , 2003 . 
 The book tells the story of a farm boy named Eragon , who finds a mysterious stone in the mountains . A dragon he later names Saphira hatches from the stone , which was really an egg . When the evil King Galbatorix finds out about Eragon and his dragon , he sends his servants , the Ra 'zac , after them in an effort to capture them . Eragon and Saphira are forced to flee from their hometown , with a storyteller called Brom , and decide to search for the Varden , a group of rebels who want the downfall of Galbatorix . 
 Critiques of Eragon often pointed out the similarities to other works such as Earthsea , Dragonlance , and Star Wars . Reviews also called the book a notable achievement for such a young author as Paolini . Eragon was the third @-@ best @-@ selling children 's hardback book of 2003 , and the second @-@ best @-@ selling paperback of 2005 . It placed on the New York Times Children 's Books Best Seller list for 121 weeks . Eragon was adapted into a feature film of the same name that was released on December 15 , 2006 .

 Christopher Paolini started reading fantasy books when he was ten years old . At the age of fourteen , as a hobby , Paolini started writing the first novel in a series of four books , but he could not get beyond a few pages because he had " no idea " where he was going . He began reading everything he could about the " art of writing " , and then plotted the whole Inheritance Cycle book series . After a month of planning out the series , he started writing the draft of Eragon by hand . It was finished a year later , and Paolini began writing the " real " version of the book . After another year of editing , Paolini 's parents saw the final manuscript . They immediately saw its potential and decided to publish the book through their small , home @-@ based publishing company , Paolini International . Paolini created the cover art for this edition of Eragon , which featured Saphira 's eye on the cover . He also drew the maps inside the book . 
 Paolini and his family toured across the United States to promote the book . Over 135 talks were given at bookshops , libraries , and schools , many with Paolini dressed up in a medieval costume ; but the book did not receive much attention . Paolini said he " would stand behind a table in my costume talking all day without a break – and would sell maybe forty books in eight hours if I did really well . [ ... ] It was a very stressful experience . I couldn 't have gone on for very much longer . " In the summer of 2002 , American novelist Carl Hiaasen was on vacation in one of the cities that Paolini gave a talk in . While there , his stepson bought a copy of Eragon that he " immediately loved " . He showed it to his stepfather , who brought the book to the attention of the publishing house Alfred A. Knopf . Michelle Frey , executive editor at Knopf , contacted Paolini and his family to ask if they were interested in having Knopf publish Eragon . The answer was yes , and after another round of editing , Knopf published Eragon in August 2003 . It also led to a new cover , drawn by John Jude Palencar . 
 = = = Inspiration and influences = = = 
 Paolini cites old myths , folk tales , medieval stories , the epic poem Beowulf , and authors J. R. R. Tolkien and Eric Rücker Eddison as his biggest influences in writing . Other literary influences include David <unk> , Andre Norton , Brian Jacques , Anne McCaffrey , Raymond E. Feist , Mervyn Peake , Ursula K. Le Guin , and Frank Herbert . Paolini has also received inspiration from the two authors Philip Pullman and Garth Nix . In Eragon , Paolini " deliberately " included the " archetypal ingredients " of a fantasy book – a quest , a journey of experience , revenge , romance , betrayal , and a " special " sword . 
 The ancient language used by the elves in Eragon is based " almost entirely " on Old Norse , German , Old English , and Russian myth . Paolini commented that " [ I ] did a god @-@ awful amount of research into the subject when I was composing it . I found that it gave the world a much richer feel , a much older feel , using these words that had been around for centuries and centuries . I had a lot of fun with that . " Picking the right name for the characters and places was a process that could take " days , weeks , or even years " . Paolini said that " if I have difficulty choosing the correct moniker , I use a placeholder name until a replacement suggests itself . " He added that he was " really lucky " with the name Eragon , " because it 's just dragon with one letter changed . " Also , Paolini commented that he thought of the name " Eragon " as the two parts of it : " era " and " gone " , as if the name itself changes the era in which the character lives . He thought the name fit the book perfectly , but some of the other names caused him " real headaches " . 
 The landscape in Eragon is based on the " wild territory " of Paolini 's home state , Montana . He said in an interview that " I go hiking a lot , and oftentimes when I 'm in the forest or in the mountains , sitting down and seeing some of those little details makes the difference between having an okay description and having a unique description . " Paolini also said that Paradise Valley , Montana is " one of the main sources " of his inspiration for the landscape in the book . Eragon takes place in the fictional continent Alagaësia . Paolini " roughed out " the main history of the land before he wrote the book , but he did not draw a map of it until it became important to see where Eragon was traveling . He then started to get history and plot ideas from seeing the landscape depicted . 
 Paolini chose to have Eragon mature throughout the book because " for one thing , it 's one of the archetypal fantasy elements " . He thought Eragon 's growth and maturation throughout the book " sort of mirrored my own growing abilities as a writer and as a person , too . So it was a very personal choice for that book . " Eragon 's dragon , Saphira , was imagined as " the perfect friend " by Paolini . He decided to go in a more " human direction " with her because she is raised away from her own species , in " close mental contact " with a human . " I considered making the dragon more dragon @-@ like , if you will , in its own society , but I haven 't had a chance to explore that . I went with a more human element with Saphira while still trying to get a bit of the magic , the alien , of her race . " Paolini made Saphira the " best friend anyone could have : loyal , funny , brave , intelligent , and noble . She transcended that , however , and became her own person , fiercely independent and proud . " Saphira 's blue tinted vision was in turn inspired by Paolini 's own color @-@ blindness . 
 Paolini added in archetypal elements of a fantasy novel like a quest , a journey of experience , revenge , romance , betrayal , and a ' special ' sword . The book is described as a fantasy with Booklist writing " Paolini knows the genre well — his lush tale is full of recognizable fantasy elements and conventions " . The book has been compared to other books of the fantasy genre such as Star Wars and Lord of the Rings . Reviews have also felt that the plot genre is too similar to those other fantasy novels . The book was called a " high fantasy " by Kirkus Review . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 A shade named Durza , along with a group of <unk> , ambushes a party of three elves . After he and the <unk> kill the other elves , Durza attempts to steal an egg , that one of the female elves carries , but is foiled when she causes it to vanish . However , he renders her unconscious with a ball of fire and has her at his mercy . 
 Eragon is a fifteen @-@ year @-@ old boy who has lived with his uncle Garrow and cousin Roran on a farm near the village of Carvahall , ever since his mother , Garrow 's sister , left him there right after his birth . While hunting in the Spine , Eragon is surprised to see the blue dragon egg , which he believes to be a stone , appear in front of him . A few months later , Eragon witnesses a baby dragon hatch from the egg . Eragon names the dragon Saphira . He raises the dragon in secret until two of King Galbatorix 's servants , the Ra 'zac , come to Carvahall ; though it is later revealed that they weren 't looking for the egg at first . Eragon and Saphira manage to escape by hiding in the Spine , but Garrow is fatally wounded and the house and farm are burned down by the Ra 'zac . Once Garrow dies , Eragon is left with no reason to stay in Carvahall , so he goes after the Ra 'zac with his newly hatched dragon , seeking vengeance for the destruction of his home and his uncle 's death . He is accompanied by Brom , an elderly storyteller , who provides Eragon with the sword Zar 'roc and insists on helping him and Saphira . 
 Eragon becomes a Dragon Rider through his bond with Saphira . Eragon is the only known Rider in Alagaësia other than King Galbatorix , who , with the help of the now @-@ dead <unk> , a group of thirteen dragon riders loyal to Galbatorix , killed every other Rider a hundred years ago . On the journey , Brom teaches Eragon sword fighting , magic , the ancient elvish language , and the ways of the Dragon Riders . Their travels bring them to the city of Teirm , where they meet with Brom 's friend Jeod . Eragon 's fortune is told by the witch Angela , and her companion , the werecat Solembum , gives Eragon some mysterious advice . With Jeod 's help , they are able to track the Ra 'zac to the southern city of Dras @-@ Leona . Although they manage to infiltrate the city , Eragon encounters the Ra 'zac in a cathedral and he and Brom are forced to flee . Later that night , their camp is ambushed by the Ra 'zac . A stranger named Murtagh rescues them , but Brom is gravely injured . Saphira watches over Brom as the night progresses , yet when morning comes they realize there is nothing they can do to save him . Brom gives Eragon his blessing , reveals that he was also once a dragon rider and that his dragon 's name was Saphira , and dies . Saphira then encases Brom in a tomb made of a diamond . 
 Murtagh becomes Eragon 's new companion and they travel to the city Gil 'ead to find information on how to find the Varden , a group of rebels who want to see the downfall of Galbatorix . While stopping near Gil 'ead , Eragon is captured and imprisoned in the same jail that holds a woman he has been having dreams about . As she is being dragged past she is revealed as an elf when her pointed ears are uncovered . Murtagh and Saphira stage a rescue , and Eragon escapes with the unconscious elf . During the escape , Eragon and Murtagh battle with Durza . Murtagh shoots Durza between the eyes with an arrow , and the Shade disappears in a cloud of mist . Then escaping , they run off . Eragon succeeds in communicating with the elf , whose name is revealed as Arya , and learns the location of the Varden . After some arguing , Murtagh decides to still travel with Eragon to the Varden but is still wary of them . 
 An army of Kull ( Urgals who can grow up to 8 feet ) reach Eragon right outside the Varden 's entrance , but are driven off with the help of the Varden , who escort Eragon , Saphira , Murtagh , and Arya to Farthen Dûr the mountain hideout of the <unk> . When they arrive in Farthen Dûr , Eragon is led to the leader of the Varden , Ajihad . Ajihad imprisons Murtagh after he refuses to allow his mind to be read to determine if he is a friend or a foe to the Varden . Eragon is told by Ajihad that Durza was not destroyed by Murtagh 's well placed arrow , because the only way to kill a Shade is with a stab through the heart . Orik , nephew of the dwarf King Hrothgar , is appointed as Eragon and Saphira 's guide . Orik shows them a place to stay and introduces them to Hrothgar . Eragon also meets Ajihad 's daughter , Nasuada , and Ajihad 's right @-@ hand man , <unk> . He also runs into Angela and Solembum , who have arrived in Tronjheim , and visits Murtagh in his prison . He is tested by two magicians , The Twins , as well as Arya . 
 Eragon and the Varden are then attacked by the Kull , as well as the rest of the Urgal army . Eragon personally battles Durza again , and succeeds in stabbing him in the heart with Zar 'roc , but at a price . Durza manages to slice a deep cut like Murtagh 's on his back . He then passes out , and is visited telepathically by a stranger while he is unconscious who tells Eragon to visit him in the Elven capital , Ellesméra .

 Eragon received generally mixed reviews and was criticized for its derivative nature . Liz Rosenberg of The New York Times Book Review criticized Eragon for having " clichéd descriptions " , " B @-@ movie dialogue " , " awkward and gangly " prose .

 = University of North Dakota = 
 The University of North Dakota ( UND ) is a public research university located in Grand Forks , North Dakota . 
 Established by the Dakota Territorial Assembly in 1883 , six years before the establishment of the state of North Dakota , UND is the oldest and largest university in the state . UND was founded as a university with a strong liberal arts foundation and is classified by the Carnegie Foundation as high research activity institution . UND is ranked among the top 100 public universities in the country by U.S. News & World Report . UND offers a variety of professional and specialized programs , including the only schools of law and medicine in the state , but is perhaps best known for its John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences , which trains pilots and air traffic controllers from around the world . It is the first university to offer a degree in unmanned aircraft systems operations . 
 UND specializes in aerospace , health sciences , nutrition , energy and environmental protection , and engineering research . Several research institutions are located on the UND campus including the Energy and Environmental Research Center , the School of Medicine and Health Sciences , and the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center . 
 The athletic teams compete in the NCAA 's Division I. Most teams compete as members of the Big Sky Conference , with the exceptions of men 's hockey ( National Collegiate Hockey Conference ) , women 's hockey ( Western Collegiate Hockey Association ) , baseball ( Western Athletic Conference ) , and swimming ( Western Athletic Conference ) . The men 's ice hockey team has won eight national championships , and plays in the Ralph Engelstad Arena .

 UND was founded in 1883 , six years before North Dakota became a state . Grand Forks native George H. Walsh submitted the bill to the Territorial Legislature of Dakota Territory that called for the new state of North Dakota 's university to be located in Grand Forks . The first classes were held on September 8 , 1884 . The first building at UND , Old Main , housed all classrooms , offices , dorm rooms , and a library . In the 1880s , UND consisted of only a few acres of property , surrounded by farms and fields , nearly two miles west of the city of Grand Forks . Students living off campus had to take a train or a horse and carriage bus , dubbed the " Black Maria " , from downtown to the campus . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 Gradually , as the university grew , more buildings were constructed on campus and a trolley system was built to connect the growing university to downtown Grand Forks . However , there were several major interruptions in the life of the university . In 1918 , UND was the hardest @-@ hit single institution in the country by the flu epidemic which killed 1 @,@ 400 people in North Dakota alone . Later that year , classes were suspended so the campus could become an army base for soldiers during World War I. During the Great Depression , UND provided free housing to students willing to do manual labor on campus . " Camp Depression , " as it was called , consisted of railroad <unk> that housed eight male students each . " Camp Depression " students did not get regular meals from the cafeteria and had to be satisfied with only free leftovers . However , a number of Grand Forks citizens often opened their homes and kitchen tables to many of these young men . 
 After World War II , enrollment quickly grew to more than 3 @,@ 000 . A large amount of housing had to be built on campus as well as several new academic buildings . The 1950s saw the rise of the Fighting Sioux hockey tradition . In the 1960s and 1970s , many student protests occurred at UND . The largest occurred in May 1970 when over 1 @,@ 500 students gathered to protest the Kent State shootings . In 1975 , enrollment swelled to a record 8 @,@ 500 . The 1970s also saw the establishment of the John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences at UND . During the 1980s and 1990s the University continued to grow . However , the devastating 1997 Red River Flood inundated numerous buildings on campus and forced the cancellation of the remainder of the school year . 
 = = = 21st century = = = 
 The start of the 21st century was marked by the opening of two major venues for UND athletics . The Ralph Engelstad Arena , home of men 's and women 's hockey , and the Alerus Center , home of UND football , both opened in 2001 . The Betty Engelstad Sioux Center opened in August 2004 , and currently serves as home to UND volleyball and men 's and women 's basketball . 
 Millions of dollars worth of construction and renovation projects have dotted the campus landscape in recent years . As part of a plan to improve student facilities on campus , UND recently constructed a Wellness Center , a parking garage , and an apartment @-@ style housing complex . Other construction projects around campus have included a new LEED Platinum @-@ certified alumni center , a renovation and expansion of the College of Education and Human Development , and an expansion of the Energy and Environmental Research Center . A $ 124 million Medicine and Health Services building is currently under construction . The new building was designed by <unk> Architects in partnership with Perkins + Will and Steinberg Architects .
