 The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files ; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) , Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) , and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) . In this episode , Doggett wakes up in Mexico with no memory of who he is or how he got there . Meanwhile , Reyes and Scully struggle to locate him . The two later discover that Doggett 's memory has been taken by a " memory vampire " that works for a drug cartel . 
 " John Doe " was written after Gilligan had been thinking of a story involving a " memory vampire " for months . Furthermore , the episode was MacLaren 's directorial debut . Noted director Kim Manners helped guide her through the process . Director of photography Bill Roe used specific lighting for the episode ; indoor scenes are dark and hard to make out whereas outside scenes are bright and over @-@ saturated with light . The Mexican hotel apartment was created from Fox Mulder 's ( David Duchovny ) old apartment set . 
 = = Plot = = 
 John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) awakens inside an abandoned warehouse to find a man in the process of stealing one of his shoes . Doggett chases the man outside , where he summons two Mexican police officers . One of the policemen hits the man with his nightstick , while the other demands his identification . When Doggett finds he has no papers , the officer asks him his name . Doggett is shocked to realize he can 't remember his own identity . 
 Doggett is taken to the local jail , where he meets a fellow prisoner named Domingo . Domingo is eventually freed and offers to have Doggett bailed out as well , under the condition that Doggett help him perform his criminal tasks . Doggett agrees , but changes his mind once he is released . Nestor , Domingo 's friend , pulls a gun , but Doggett quickly overpowers him and takes the weapon . Doggett returns to the warehouse in hopes of finding clues to his identity . From time to time , he experiences flashbacks of his wife and son , but has no idea who they are . 
 In the meantime , in Washington , Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) examine video footage from a security camera positioned at the Mexican border . FBI Deputy Director Alvin Kersh disbands the task force searching for Doggett , believing the video is proof that he entered Mexico on his own free will and was not abducted . Meanwhile , Doggett phones a U.S. Marine Corps public affairs office , hoping his Marine tattoo will shed some light on his true identity . Before he is able to ask any questions , he notices policemen nearby and flees . 
 Scully traces Doggett 's phone call and has Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) travel to the Mexican town where he was last seen . It is revealed that Caballero , an enforcer for the local drug cartel , is a " memory vampire " : he can absorb the memories of those posing a threat to the cartel . Reyes finds Doggett and faces gunfire from the police , who are likewise controlled by the cartel ; all the while , Reyes attempts to remind Doggett of who they are . Doggett remembers his son . The agents are rescued by Skinner and the Mexican Federales . Doggett tearfully admits that he is happy to have all of his memories , even the bad ones , " as long as I remember the good . ”

 " John Doe " was written by executive producer Vince Gilligan and directed by Michelle MacLaren . The episode marked Gilligan 's first solo episode for the ninth season . Gilligan had " <unk> " with the story of a " memory vampire " for months , before writing it . The notion to set the story in Mexico and center it around Robert Patrick 's character was Frank Spotnitz 's idea . From there the story " went together fairly easily . " 
 " John Doe " was co @-@ executive MacLaren 's directorial debut . Although she had never helmed an episode before , MacLaren utilized information that she had gathered by working with Kim Manners , one of the series ' prolific directors . She later noted , " Kim taught me how he breaks down a script and prepares his shot list . The most powerful thing he said to me was that he imagines the show all cut together and sees the movie in his head and really visualizes it . " Gilligan later said that MacLaren " really rose to the occasion and really did her homework . " The bus crash scene was created with the use of elaborate " smoke and mirrors " , according to Gilligan . Over nine cameras were used to film the entire scene . Several of the cameras were under @-@ cranked in order to give the illusion that the bus was going faster than it really was . A steel ramp was buried in the ground to flip the bus . However , the scene was reportedly torpid to film . Gilligan later joked that " You could have stood there and had a sandwich while the thing was backing up : it was so slow . " 
 = = = Filming and effects = = = 
 Director of photography Bill Roe later stated that he borrowed motifs from Steven Soderbergh 's 2000 film Traffic for some of the shots . In addition , before filming , he decided to do various test shots to get the lighting right . The crew ended up shooting " exteriors three , four stops over what you should shoot it at " , resulting in very washed out outdoor scenes . Roe and his crew had a hard time developing the various lighting contrasts for the episode . When talking about the episode , Roe said : " it was really dark so we had this huge contrast of lighting . It was dark and warm and brown . When you go inside , you can barely see things , but when you 're outside , it 's just blaring . " To create the Mexican town featured in the episode , scenes were filmed at a small town located outside of Los Angeles . A matte of the town 's background and blue sky were then cut and a faux Mexican background was added . In addition , Mat Beck was given a flyer , and he duplicated it , making several strings of posters that did not exist when the shots were filmed . 
 When creating the Mexican hotel apartment , the crew re @-@ decorated what was once Fox Mulder 's ( David Duchovny ) apartment on the show . Production Designer Corey Kaplan said of the development of the episode that , " It was very creative and very rewarding for us as an art department , to create the complete total look of being in another culture . " Several Spanish songs are featured in the episode . When the characters are at the cantina , the song " La <unk> " by Roberto Ruiz is playing . During scenes in the garage " Juana La Cubana " by Fito Olivares is featured .

 " John Doe " first aired in the United States on January 13 , 2002 . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 5 @.@ 0 , meaning that it was seen by 5 @.@ 0 % of the nation 's estimated households and was viewed by 5 @.@ 28 million households . " John Doe " was the 66th most watched episode of television that aired during the week ending January 13 . The episode later aired in the United Kingdom on December 16 , 2002 on BBC Two . 
 The episode received largely positive reviews from television critics . Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A – rating . Juliette Harrisson of Den of Geek named " John Doe " the best stand @-@ alone episode of season nine and called it " a refreshing change of pace " . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five . The two praised Gilligan 's script and Patrick 's performance , noting that the former " writes the script with a dirtiness that gives it real power " and the latter 's acting was " extraordinary " . Furthermore , Shearman and Pearson wrote that " ' John Doe ' shows that there 's still a fresh take to be had on The X @-@ Files after all " . Meghan Deans of Tor.com applauded the episode and called it " a clear bright spot in a dark and dismal season , both in its script and in its shooting . " She felt that the focus on Doggett was effectively done , and the script focused on " strong character arcs " , which worked towards its advantage . In the end , she concluded that the episode was " part of the X @-@ Files , <unk> than would an alien or a mutant " because it focused on the idea that " pain makes you , more pain makes you better , and living within that pain keeps you alive . " M.A. Crang , in his book Denying the Truth : Revisiting The X @-@ Files after 9 / 11 , praised the central premise , the cinematography and Patrick 's performance , calling " John Doe " a " stylishly produced entry " . 
 = Katsudō Shashin = 
 Katsudō Shashin ( 活動写真 , " moving picture " ) , sometimes called the Matsumoto fragment , is a Japanese animated filmstrip that is the oldest known work of animation from Japan . Its creator is unknown . Evidence suggests it was made before 1912 , so it may predate the earliest displays of Western animated films in Japan . It was discovered in a collection of films and projectors in Kyoto in 2005 . 
 The three @-@ second filmstrip depicts a boy who writes " 活動写真 " , removes his hat , and waves . The frames were stencilled in red and black using a device for making magic lantern slides , and the filmstrip was fastened in a loop for continuous play . 
 = = Description = = 
 Katsudō Shashin consists of a series of cartoon images on fifty frames of a celluloid strip and lasts three seconds at sixteen frames per second . It depicts a young boy in a sailor suit who writes the kanji characters " 活動写真 " ( <unk> shashin , " moving picture " ) from right to left , then turns to the viewer , removes his hat , and salutes . Katsudō Shashin is a provisional title for the film , whose actual title is unknown . 
 Unlike in traditional animation , the frames were not produced by photographing the images , but rather were impressed onto film using a stencil . This was done with a kappa @-@ ban , a device for stencilling magic lantern slides . The images were in red and black on a strip of 35 mm film whose ends were fastened in a loop for continuous viewing . 
 = = Background = = 
 Early printed animation films for optical toys such as the zoetrope predated projected film animation . German toy manufacturer Gebrüder Bing presented a <unk> at a toy festival in Nuremberg in 1898 ; soon other toy manufacturers sold similar devices . Live @-@ action films for these devices were expensive to make ; possibly as early as 1898 animated films for these devices were on sale , and could be fastened in loops for continuous viewing . Imports of these German devices appeared in Japan at least as early as 1904 ; films for them likely included animation loops . 
 Projected film technology arrived in Japan from the West in 1896 – 97 . The earliest display of foreign animation in Japanese theatres that can be dated with certainty is of the French animator Émile Cohl 's The Nipper 's Transformations ( 1911 ) , which premièred in Tokyo on 15 April 1912 . Works by <unk> Shimokawa , <unk> Kitayama , and Jun 'ichi <unk> in 1917 were the first Japanese animated films to reach theatre screens . The films are lost , but a few have been discovered in " toy movie " versions for viewing at home on hand @-@ cranked projectors ; the oldest to survive is <unk> <unk> <unk> no maki ( 1917 ) , titled <unk> @-@ <unk> in its home version . 
 = = Rediscovery = = 
 In December 2004 , a secondhand dealer in Kyoto contacted Natsuki Matsumoto , an expert in iconography at the Osaka University of Arts . The dealer had obtained a collection of films and projectors from an old Kyoto family , and Matsumoto arrived the next month to fetch them . The collection included three projectors , eleven 35 mm films , and thirteen glass magic lantern slides . 
 When Matsumoto found Katsudō Shashin in the collection , the filmstrip was in poor condition . The collection included three Western animated <unk> ; Katsudō Shashin may have been made in imitation of such examples of German or other Western animation . Based on evidence such as the likely manufacture dates of the projectors in the collection , Matsumoto and animation historian Nobuyuki <unk> determined the film was most likely made in the late Meiji period , which ended in 1912 ; historian Frederick S. <unk> has suggested c . 1907 as a likely date , and that " a production date before 1905 or after 1912 is unlikely " . At the time , movie theatres were rare in Japan ; evidence suggests Katsudō Shashin was mass @-@ produced to be sold to wealthy owners of home projectors . The creator of the filmstrip remains unknown ; to Matsumoto , the relatively poor quality and low @-@ tech printing technique indicate it was likely from a smaller company . 
 The discovery was widely covered in Japanese media . Given its speculated date of creation , the film would have been contemporary to — or even have predated — early animated works by Cohl and the American animators J. Stuart Blackton and Winsor McCay . The newspaper Asahi Shimbun acknowledged the importance of the discovery of Meiji @-@ period animation , but expressed reservations about placing the film in the genealogy of Japanese animation , writing that it is " controversial that [ Katsudō Shashin ] should even be called animation in the contemporary sense " . 
 = 2015 Bahrain Grand Prix = 
 The 2015 Bahrain Grand Prix ( formally known as the 2015 Formula 1 Gulf Air Bahrain Grand Prix ) was a Formula One motor race that was held on 19 April 2015 at the Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir , Bahrain . The race was the fourth round of the 2015 season and marked the eleventh time that the Bahrain Grand Prix has been run as a round of the Formula One World Championship . 
 Lewis Hamilton , who was the defending race winner , came into the race with a 13 @-@ point lead over Sebastian Vettel after his victory a week prior in China . He took the 42nd pole position of his career during Saturday 's qualifying , and his fourth in a row . In the race , Hamilton managed to win from Kimi Räikkönen and Nico Rosberg , taking his 36th race victory . 
 = = Report = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 There were tensions in the Mercedes team prior to the Grand Prix . After the Chinese Grand Prix the week before , Nico Rosberg had accused his teammate Lewis Hamilton of deliberately backing him into the charging Ferraris during the race , claiming he had " compromised " his race . Hamilton in turn claimed that Rosberg was never close enough to attack him , an assertion that Rosberg rejected , saying he " did try to attack " . The team reacted by issuing a warning to their drivers , that they would start " managing " them more if they should not be able to race for the best of the team on track . After comments made by Hamilton saying that his contract extension negotiations were going slow , rumours arose that Hamilton had asked for a clear number one status in the team , a claim denied by both driver and team . 
 = = = = Political protests = = = = 
 As with previous years there were protests against the race going forward . The protests highlighted the situation of the Shi 'ite majority in the Sunni @-@ ruled Arab country , demanding the release of political prisoners . The protesters tried to use the arrival of Formula One to bring their demands into the public eye . The race came only one week after a report was published by Amnesty International about " unabated " human rights violations in Bahrain . In previous years , Formula One commercial rights executive Bernie Ecclestone had maintained the view that the political situation should be kept separate from the sport , saying in 2013 : " We ’ re not here , or we don ’ t go anywhere , to judge how a country is run " . However , in what was viewed as a " 180 @-@ degree policy reversal " , Formula One issued a statement ahead of the 2015 Grand Prix , stating that it " has committed itself to respecting human rights in Bahrain and other countries in which it conducts business " .

 Per the regulations for the 2015 season , three practice sessions were held , two 1 @.@ 5 @-@ hour sessions on Friday and another one @-@ hour session before qualifying on Saturday . Kimi Räikkönen and Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari were quickest in the first free practice session on Friday afternoon , with Räikkönen the only driver to lap the course in less than 1 : 38 . The Mercedes team focused on long runs , running their cars on high fuel loads to examine tyre wear and were therefore down in 15th and 16th places respectively . Vettel 's Ferrari showed problems early in the session , but Vettel was able to run without issues towards the end . Jenson Button spun out in turn one on the start of his first flying lap and was unable to run again as his team tried to change his car 's battery . It was however an uplifting session for McLaren nonetheless , since Button 's teammate Fernando Alonso finished in seventh place , just seven tenths away from Räikkönen 's fastest time . After China the week before , Jolyon Palmer once again took part in the first practice session for Lotus . 
 Mercedes hit back in the second session on Friday night , with Nico Rosberg leading his teammate Lewis Hamilton by about a tenth of a second . The Ferraris were about half a second behind , with Räikkönen again the faster of the two . It was another dismal session for Jenson Button who had to park his car halfway through the session , though he was able to come back for a couple of laps towards the end of the session . A late red flag came out when Vettel , braking slowly into turn one , was clipped by the Force India of Sergio Pérez , taking off part of his front wing endplate . 
 Lewis Hamilton topped the time sheets in Saturday 's free practice session , with Sebastian Vettel a tenth of a second behind , while Rosberg and Räikkönen completed the top four . Few cars took to the track during the early part of the session due to high temperatures and strong winds . A brief red flag period occurred midway through practice when Daniil Kvyat spun out in turn four . 
 = = = Qualifying = = = 
 Qualifying consisted of three parts , 18 , 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively , with five drivers eliminated from competing after each of the first two sessions . All teams , including Mercedes used the softer tyre compound during the first session ( Q1 ) . Jenson Button , who had problems with his car all during practice , was unable to set a time when his car broke down on his out lap . Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time , with Valtteri Bottas in second . Along with Button , both Manor Marussias were eliminated in Q1 , as well as Daniil Kvyat – who made a mistake during his final lap – and Pastor Maldonado . Fernando Alonso was the first driver to reach a second qualifying session for McLaren over the course of the season . 
 Hamilton once again set the time in Q2 , almost a second ahead of second @-@ placed Kimi Räikkönen , while Felipe Massa went faster than Sebastian Vettel in third . Alonso was eliminated in 14th position , ahead of Max Verstappen in the Toro Rosso , who was half a second slower than Carlos Sainz , Jr . , his team mate . Sergio Pérez joined the two Saubers as the last three cars not to make it into the top 10 . 
 All but Daniel Ricciardo did their first run in Q3 on used tyres in order to save a set for the race , with Hamilton fastest yet again . When the cars came around for their second and final timed laps , Ricciardo crossed the line first ahead of the Ferraris , with Vettel going faster than team mate Räikkönen . When the two Mercedes came across the line last , Hamilton took his fourth consecutive pole position , while Nico Rosberg had to settle for third on the grid , not being able to beat Vettel 's time . The two Williams cars filled the third row , while Nico Hülkenberg was delighted with eighth on the grid .

 Jenson Button was required to apply to the stewards to be allowed to race , because he did not post a lap time during the first part of qualifying . They gave him permission to start based on his satisfactory practice times . 
 = = = Race = = = 
 Prior to the start , McLaren confirmed that they were unable to get Jenson Button 's car to the grid , as the data indicated his earlier electrical issues continued . Felipe Massa 's Williams did not get off the line at the start of the formation lap , so he had to start from pit lane . The start lights went on after a long delay , due to Pastor Maldonado being in the wrong grid position . 
 At the start proper , Lewis Hamilton was able to hold his lead , while his teammate Nico Rosberg tried to attack Sebastian Vettel in second place . This opened up the opportunity for the second Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen to go around the outside of the Mercedes and take third . Hamilton tried to open up a gap in order to cover his position , should the Ferraris attempt a so @-@ called undercut , a strategy in which a car pits early in order to use fresher tyres to get in front of another car without overtaking them on track . Meanwhile , Rosberg took back third from Räikkönen on lap four before doing the same with Vettel on the end of lap nine . 
 As the pit stops started on lap eleven , Massa , Nico Hülkenberg and Felipe Nasr were the first to come in for new tyres . Hamilton had managed to extend his advantage over Vettel to almost 8 seconds when Vettel pitted – the first of the front runners to do so – on lap 14 . The undercut @-@ strategy worked , as Rosberg emerged from the pits behind the Ferrari when he pitted one lap later . Hamilton changed tyres on the following lap , emerging close in front of the battling Rosberg and Vettel , with the Mercedes driver taking second position in a DRS @-@ aided move on the inside of turn one . He was now close behind teammate Hamilton , but ultimately unable to attack him for the lead . Räikkönen was the last of the top four to pit , on lap 18 and applied a different strategy , as he used the harder medium tyres , while the Mercedes and Vettel were running their middle stint on the softer tyre compound . Even with the harder tyres , he was able to close to the top three . 
 Felipe Massa tried to make up places after his pit lane @-@ start , but was caught in midfield battles . He went into the pits simultaneously with Felipe Nasr in front and Pastor Maldonado behind him . A swift stop by the Lotus pit crew meant that Maldonado was able to get out ahead and gain two positions . Sauber driver Marcus Ericsson was running eighth when he came into the pits on lap 26 . A 27 @-@ second pit stop due to problems with the front left tyre meant that he fell out of reach for a points finish . Carlos Sainz , Jr. retired from the race right after exiting pit lane on lap 30 , due to an issue with his front left wheel . His Toro Rosso teammate Max Verstappen joined him on the sidelines on lap 34 due to an electrical failure . 
 On lap 34 , both Hamilton and Vettel came in for their second and final planned stop , both equipping the medium tyre set . The undercut worked once more for the Ferrari , as Rosberg emerged behind Vettel one lap later . However , Vettel ran wide on the exit of the final corner on lap 36 , letting Rosberg past and damaging his front wing , meaning he had to come into the pits for an unscheduled stop on the next lap , leaving him down in fifth position . His teammate Räikkönen pitted for a second time on lap 40 , taking the softer and faster tyres , trying to catch the two Mercedes towards the end of the race . Fourteen laps before the finish , Räikkönen was fifteen seconds down on second @-@ placed Rosberg , but closing by more than a second per lap . With the Mercedes in front having to make their way through backmarkers , Räikkönen was able to cut down the gap even faster , reaching Rosberg with three laps of the race to go . Rosberg , suffering from brake overheating over the entire course of the race , <unk> himself at turn one on lap 56 , which allowed Räikkönen to take second place from him . The other Mercedes of Hamilton had brake problems as well towards the end , but was able to control the gap to the Ferrari to take his third victory of the season . 
 Four @-@ time world champion Vettel however was unable to overtake the Williams of Valtteri Bottas for fourth . The other Williams of Felipe Massa had applied the undercut well in the early part of the race to recover from his pit lane @-@ start to eighth position , but when his tyres started to degrade he was passed by both Sergio Pérez and Daniil Kvyat and finished tenth , taking one point . The race ended spectacularly when the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo suffered an engine blow @-@ up on the final straight , just being able to coast his car over the finish line . 
 = = = Post @-@ race = = = 
 During the podium interviews conducted by Jackie Stewart , Lewis Hamilton conceded it had been a tough race , saying : " The Ferraris gave us a real good run for our money and out there it was really difficult to look after the tyres in these conditions , behind backmarkers and all sorts , but fortunately I was able to keep the car together , keep the tyres as healthy as possible and pull it through . " Kimi Räikkönen expressed disappointment with not being able to win , but said he was " very happy how the team is working " and highlighted the big step forward Ferrari had made over the winter . Nico Rosberg was disappointed about the brake failure costing him second place , but added that he was very happy with the car altogether . 
 Sebastian Vettel said he felt that he had let the team down with his mistake that cost him a chance to challenge Rosberg for second position himself , but was happy with " a good recovery and still some decent points " . 
 After the race , particular praise from the press was directed at Räikkönen , who returned to the podium for the first time since the 2013 Korean Grand Prix , 18 months prior . German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung called his drive a " cool application " for a contract extension after 2015 . 
 After Daniel Ricciardo 's engine gave up on the finish straight of the last lap , he was already down to his last engine of the season after only four races . Should he needed to use another one , he would face grid penalties . This added to Renault 's problems , after the two Toro Rossos also failed to finish and put more strain on the relationship between Red Bull and their engine provider . Max Verstappen was quoted calling the engine " a bit of a nightmare " , saying it could jeopardise the goal of fifth place for Toro Rosso in the constructors ' championship . Subsequently , team boss Christian Horner confirmed that the teams would agree on the plan decided upon earlier that year , to increase the engine limit from four to five , taking some of the pressure off Red Bull and Ricciardo .

 = Tropical Storm Grace ( 2009 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Grace holds the record for being the farthest northeast forming tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin . The seventh named storm of the slightly below average 2009 Atlantic hurricane season , Grace formed from an extratropical cyclone over the Azores on October 4 . It strengthened to attain peak sustained winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) and developed an eye @-@ like feature , although cold sea surface temperatures inhibited the development of thunderstorm activity near the center . The storm lost its tropical characteristics on October 6 , though the remnants merged with a separate system near the British Isles . 
 Grace had only minor effects on land , although while it was passing through the Azores , islands close to the storm 's center recorded winds of up to 44 mph ( 71 km / h ) and moderate rainfall . Although not solely related to the cyclone , heavy rainfall in Portugal led to some street flooding . The remnants also impacted parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom , where rainfall approaching 2 in ( 51 mm ) and tropical storm @-@ force winds were recorded . However , no damage occurred . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Tropical Storm Grace originated from a large extratropical cyclone that formed along a cold front on September 27 , roughly 470 mi ( 755 km ) east of Cape Race , Newfoundland . Initially attached to an occluded front , the low detached from the system and gradually acquired tropical characteristics . By October 1 , shower and thunderstorm activity began to develop near the center of the system as it tracked through the central Azores . However , the following day , convection began to decrease with the system , and the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) ceased monitoring it . Over the following two days , the system executed a counter @-@ clockwise loop near the Azores . During the afternoon of October 4 , convection redeveloped around the center of the low and was classified as a tropical storm near São Miguel Island . Although the storm was tropical at this time , the NHC did not issue advisories for several hours . 
 The first advisory from the NHC was issued at 11 : 00 AST on October 4 ; at this time , the system was officially named Grace , the seventh named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season . The storm featured relatively deep convection around an eye @-@ like feature . Although Grace was over waters normally not warm enough for tropical cyclone development , low wind shear allowed the convection to persist . A steady northeastward track was taken by the storm in response to a southerly flow over the northwestern Atlantic . The storm intensified slightly as it moved over decreasing sea surface temperatures , with winds estimated at 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) early on October 5 . 
 A large extratropical cyclone near Grace caused the storm to deteriorate in organization , with convection weakening and becoming asymmetric . By this time , the storm was over 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) waters , likely inhibiting convective development . Shower and thunderstorm activity continued to diminish throughout the day on October 5 ; however , Grace maintained tropical characteristics , namely a deep , warm core . Early on October 6 , the NHC issued their final advisory on Grace as it merged with a frontal system over the northeastern Atlantic . Just prior to merging , the lowest pressure in relation to the storm was recorded at 986 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 12 inHg ) . The extratropical remnants of Grace persisted for roughly 18 hours before dissipating over the Celtic Sea early on October 7 . However , the United States Naval Research Laboratory continued to monitor the system for several more hours until it moved over the North Sea . 
 Although officially designated a tropical cyclone by the NHC , Météo @-@ France , the French meteorological service , stated in their annual report to the World Meteorological Organization that Grace should not have been classified a tropical system . In their report , they argued that although the storm presented deep convection , an eye @-@ like feature , and winds above 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) , the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid @-@ latitude non @-@ tropical cyclone . However , operationally , Météo @-@ France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone . They also criticized the NHC of warning upon this system based on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity . 
 = = Impact and records = = 
 Upon being classified a tropical cyclone within the Azores , a few islands received minor rainfall and high winds . Gusts up to 44 mph ( 71 km / h ) were recorded on Ponta Delgada . While merging with the frontal system on October 6 , the storm 's outer bands produced heavy rains and strong winds over parts of Portugal , resulting in some street flooding . In higher elevations , wind gusts were estimated to have exceeded 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) . 
 Due to the storm 's relatively rapid forward movement by the time it reached the United Kingdom , rainfall was limited . In Ireland , 1 @.@ 18 in ( 30 mm ) of precipitation fell in the city of Cork . Sustained winds in the city were recorded up to 23 mph ( 37 km / h ) . Rainfall in the country peaked at 48 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) in Wexford . Near the coastline of Wales , a buoy recorded sustained winds up to 41 mph ( 66 km / h ) , equivalent to a minimal tropical storm . Late on October 6 , the remnants of Grace moved inland over Wales , bringing heavy rains and high winds to the region . Maximum rainfall in the United Kingdom reached 1 @.@ 92 in ( 49 mm ) in Capel <unk> . One ship , the Cap Castillo ( call sign <unk> ) , recorded sustained winds of 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) on October 5 , while located about 110 mi ( 180 km ) south of the storm 's center . Moisture from the storm 's remnants fueled another , more powerful cyclone that caused flooding in parts of Belgium after producing upwards of 2 @.@ 4 in ( 61 mm ) of rain . 
 Operationally , Grace was not classified a tropical storm until it reached latitude 41 @.@ 2 ° N. This marked the second northernmost formation of a tropical storm in the Atlantic on record ; only Tropical Storm Alberto of 1988 had formed farther north . However , a post @-@ storm analysis concluded that Grace had actually become a tropical storm 12 hours earlier than initially estimated , placing its location of development further south , at 38 @.@ 5 ° N. The storm still marked the farthest northeast a tropical cyclone formed in the Atlantic basin , breaking the record set by Hurricane Vince in 2005 . 
 In its Tropical Cyclone Report on Grace , the National Hurricane Center reported that the formation of Grace was poorly forecast . The first mention of the precursor low on October 1 predicted that it would not develop into a tropical or subtropical cyclone . Over the following three days , the system was not mentioned in the NHC 's tropical weather outlooks until just prior to Grace 's classification . The lack of preceding outlooks was attributed to the storm 's unusual location and the sparsity of data for storms in the region .

 Pokémon Channel , released in Japan as Pokémon Channel ~ Together with Pikachu ! ~ ( <unk> ～ <unk> ！ ～ , Pokemon <unk> ~ <unk> to Issho ! ~ ) , is a 2003 video game in the Pokémon series for the GameCube , developed by Ambrella and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company . The player 's goal is to help Professor Oak refine and promote his TV network through watching broadcasts with a Pikachu . The game contains elements of the adventure , digital pet , and simulation genres . The player can explore full 3D environments , have Pikachu converse with other Pokémon , and collect various items . 
 The game was developed rather quickly as a sequel to the Nintendo 64 title Hey You , Pikachu ! and to promote the Nintendo e @-@ Reader accessory , and uses a novel 3D texturing effect . It was first showcased at Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) 2003 and later through a month @-@ long series of promotional events in Sapporo , Hokkaido , Japan . It was released on July 18 , 2003 , in Japan , December 1 in North America , and April 2 , 2004 , in Europe . In Japan , the game sold 66 @,@ 373 copies in its first year . It received mixed reviews , which generally criticized its low level of interactivity and repetitive sound effects , though its collecting aspects and visuals were somewhat better received .

 Pokémon Channel is difficult to categorize into a genre , as it incorporates elements of adventure , simulation , and digital pet games . The graphics are in 3D , the perspective is first @-@ person , and the player navigates and selects things with a cursor . The game centers on watching television programs with a Pikachu , a mouse @-@ like Pokémon . The player , who lives in a house , can channel @-@ surf freely among the various channels of a television network created by the elderly Professor Oak , as well as explore one room of the house and several outdoor areas . Pikachu sometimes displays emotional reactions while watching , such as happiness or anger . The game takes place over a few days , with unique plot events on each . The GameCube 's inner clock tracks time such that every in @-@ game day lasts at least as long as one real @-@ time day . 
 While several channels are available , only a few are essential to the completion of the game . The player saves the game by reporting on recent accomplishments to Oak at Prof. Oak Report , watches episodes of an anime series at Pichu Bros. , and listens to plot @-@ advancing news coverage from a <unk> at Pokémon News Flash ( PNF ) . On a channel called Shop ' n Squirtle , the player uses the game 's currency , " Poké " , to purchase bus passes to travel among the game 's locations , as well as non @-@ essential items like Pokémon dolls , new television sets in various styles , and other decorations , all delivered by a <unk> ( a bird @-@ like Pokémon that carries various items in its satchel ) . <unk> channels include the trivia @-@ based game show Quiz <unk> , where the player earns Poké , the art exhibition program Smeargle 's Art Study , where Smeargle gives opinions on art that can be created in a paint @-@ by @-@ numbers style in the player 's house , and the exercise program <unk> Shape @-@ Up . 
 The main collectibles available in Pokémon Channel are trading cards that display various Pokémon . The trading cards , known in game as Nice Cards , exist in three forms : Single , which simply show a picture ; Motion , which are holographic ; and Platinum , which are holographic and play the respective Pokémon 's cries . The collectibles can be found by having Pikachu speak with other Pokémon and help them with tasks , or by ordering from Shop ' n Squirtle . There is a virtual Pokémon Mini console hidden under the player 's bed that plays six games : <unk> 's Lunch Time ( exclusive to Pokémon Channel ) and five others previously released for the real @-@ life Pokémon Mini . The games are simple and mainly based on rhythm . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The game opens with a group of Magnemite — magnet @-@ like Pokémon with levitation abilities — delivering a television to the player 's house . Upon turning the television on , Professor Oak appears to request the player 's help : he is creating a new television network for Trainers and their Pokémon to enjoy together , and he wants the player to serve as a beta tester . He has them watch an episode of an anime called Pichu Bros. and then introduces the game 's basic features before leaving them alone . The player then hears Pokémon cries from outside , which turn out to belong to a Pikachu and two other creatures : the reptilian <unk> and the avian <unk> . While the others run off , the Pikachu stays and the player adopts it . Oak decides to allow Pikachu to be a second beta tester . 
 After completing a few tasks , the player returns to Oak 's channel , and the Professor remarks that Pikachu has behaved remarkably well . The overexcited Pikachu uses its Thunderbolt attack on the television and destroys it . Unfazed , Oak has the Magnemite deliver a " retro " television while the player and Pikachu wait for a replacement of the original . When the replacement arrives the next morning , the Professor remarks that the player 's viewership has brought life to the network and helped spawn new shows . The player then finds a bus stop and visits Viridian Forest , a location that first appeared in Pokémon Red and Blue . 
 The third day opens with Pikachu asleep in the cupboard and Oak expressing pleasure at the Pokémon 's growing attachment to the player . On the fourth day , Pikachu invites its friends back over . Little else occurs on these two days besides visits to the snowy Mt . Snowfall and the tropical Cobalt Coast , although Oak does continue to laud the player 's investment in the network , which has become a huge success . 
 On the morning of the fifth day , the Pokémon News Flash reports on a breaking news story : a disc containing the unaired fifth episode of Pichu Bros. was dropped and lost by the delivery Magnemite on their way to the show 's broadcasting studio . After obtaining a lamp from a friendly <unk> in the front lawn , the player takes a bus back to Mt . Snowfall , where the disc was presumed lost . Eastward are the Ruins of Truth , where the stubborn Ghost @-@ type Pokémon <unk> blocks the player 's path until it is scared away by the lamp . Inside the Ruins , Pikachu gets stuck inside a statue of the bat @-@ like Pokémon <unk> . Upon being shaken free , the missing disc pops out . The player hands it back to Magnemite , who is waiting sheepishly outside , and heads home to watch the last episode , along with a video called Meowth 's Party . 
 Oak informs the player that every program produced for his network has been aired , thanking the player and Pikachu for their time , and announces the impending arrival of a gift for them . The gift , which arrives the following morning , is a " Star Projector " , a device for viewing images flashed across the sky . That night , Professor Oak notices that a Pokémon has arrived at the player 's house — the rare and legendary Jirachi — which leaves him in shock . The player , Pikachu , and Jirachi then visit Camp Starlight , the locale for which the Projector is intended . Using it , they project the entire series of Pichu Bros. and Meowth 's Party onto the sky for the universe to see , and the story ends . This event also allows players of the PAL version ( <unk> Europe and Australia ) to download a Jirachi to a copy of Pokémon Ruby or Sapphire via the Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable .

 Pokémon Channel was developed by Nintendo subsidiary Ambrella and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company . It was created both to serve as a spiritual successor to Hey You , Pikachu ! — a similar digital pet @-@ type game wherein the player plays with a Pikachu — and to promote the Nintendo e @-@ Reader peripheral device . The game included three e @-@ Reader @-@ compatible cards , but not the e @-@ Reader device itself . When scanned , the cards upload new templates for the player to paint and for Smeargle to critique . 
 The game uses the visual effect of applying pre @-@ rendered video footage to a polygon , specifically the game 's pre @-@ recorded shows on the television . IGN writer Anoop Gantayat praised this effect 's implementation , although he did note some minor graphical issues visible in the transition from distanced to full @-@ screen viewing . Also unusual for the Pokémon video game series , the Pokémon 's voices are borrowed from the anime and sound like their names . 
 The game was first announced at E3 2003 , where IGN staff noted that the game 's demo appeared to be early in development due to its choppy frame rate . Pokémon Channel was released on July 18 , 2003 , in Japan , December 1 in North America , and April 2 , 2004 , in Europe . The game was showcased on its Japanese release date at the Sapporo , Hokkaido , location of Pokémon Fest 2003 ( <unk> , Pokemon Festa 2003 ) , a series of promotional events that extended across Japan and lasted about a month . Attendees could play the game at GameCube kiosks . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Pokémon Channel has scores of 51 % and 55 % on the review aggregators GameRankings and Metacritic , respectively , both indicating a mixed or average reception . Reviewers felt that the game would only suit existing Pokémon fans and young children : staff at 1UP.com summarized that " the various diversions here are cute , slickly produced , and entertaining , assuming you really , really dig Pokémon " , and that even fans would be bored if over the age of five . Justin Leeper of Game Informer claimed that fans would enjoy it but " everyone else will be turned off , pun intended " . Author Tokyo Drifter of GamePro guessed that the game had been " tailored for die @-@ hard fans " and would please no one else . IGN 's Mary Jane Irwin stated that its intuitive interface , copious instructions , and " mindless entertainment " would keep young players entertained . Nintendo Power 's review called the game " hours of fun for Pokémon fans . " 
 Reviewers complained about the game 's low level of interactivity due to most of the gameplay time being spent watching television with Pikachu . Summarizing the gameplay in general as " weak " , GameSpot 's Ricardo Torres argued that the game 's promising ideas were fundamentally deadened by " the gimmick of having to ' virtually ' watch television programs " and the long stretches of time this entails . Leeper claimed that Pikachu " will be content much longer than you will " and decried the channels ' non @-@ interactive nature while praising the unlockable status of a few . Darryl Vassar of GameSpy went even further and claimed that there was " no gameplay " . He gave the game only one star out of five as a result , despite calling the animation quality and Pokémon voices " decent " . Tokyo Drifter found its low interactivity and slow pace to be the two biggest barriers for Pokémon fan enjoyment , and gave the game a 3 @.@ 0 on a five @-@ point scale . Irwin stated that the player would desire more interactivity and condemned the programs overall , with the exception of Pichu Bros , which she called " the only worthwhile programming " . 
 The game 's 3D graphics received lukewarm opinions . Torres called them " decent but unspectacular " and " bland " . His praise focused on the animations of the Pokémon with " distinct animations that suit their personalities " , especially that of Pikachu . Irwin echoed these opinions . Vassar stated that the Pokémon animations were better than those in the then @-@ upcoming GameCube title Pokémon Colosseum and found the environments passable , if boring and overly limited . Tokyo Drifter found the environments " bright and colorful " while wholeheartedly praising the smooth and " adorable " Pokémon animations . 
 The sound and music were negatively received . Torres focused on their repetitiveness , stating that some of the music within the programs was catchy but " it starts to grate after some of the mandatory repeated viewings you 'll have to endure " , and that the paucity of sound effects " puts the weight of the audio burden on the Pokémon voices , which , while accurate , are naturally repetitive " . Irwin and Vassar gave special focus to the repetitiveness of the voices . Tokyo Drifter gave little opinion on the voices but found the lack of voice acting for Oak to be disappointing . 
 Critics praised the large number of collectible items and Pokémon in the game . Torres noted the game 's many items to collect and Pokémon for Pikachu to meet , and praised the game 's increased replay value as a result . Tokyo Drifter thought similarly , calling the collecting aspects " a prominent part of the gaming experience " . Irwin found the collecting aspects a nice way to pass time and called the incorporation of the virtual Pokémon Mini " a nice diversion " . 
 Within three days of its Japanese release , Pokémon Channel sold 12 @,@ 581 copies , making it the thirteenth best @-@ selling game among all platforms during its release week ( July 14 to July 20 ) . By August 17 , 2003 , its Japanese sales totaled 38 @,@ 617 copies . The title had sold 66 @,@ 373 copies in Japan by December 28 of the same year .

 King 's Highway 63 , commonly referred to as Highway 63 , is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario . The 63 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 39 @.@ 5 mi ) route travels from Highway 11 and Highway 17 ( the Trans @-@ Canada Highway ) in North Bay northeast to the Ontario @-@ Quebec provincial boundary , where it continues as Route 101 into Témiscaming . 
 The route was assumed in 1937 , following the merger of the Department of Northern Development ( DND ) into the Department of Highways ( DHO ) , predecessor to the modern Ministry of Transportation of Ontario ( MTO ) . It travelled from what was then Highway 11 ( Main Street ) in downtown North Bay northeast to its present terminus . The highway follows the same route today , with the exception of the westernmost 1 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) , which were transferred to the City of North Bay in 1998 .

 Highway 63 begins at Highway 11 and Highway 17 ( the Trans @-@ Canada Highway ) in North Bay and travels 63 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 39 @.@ 5 mi ) northeast to the Ontario – Quebec provincial boundary , where Route 101 continues into Témiscaming . It travels through the communities of <unk> , Redbridge , Balsam Creek , <unk> and Thorne . Prior to 1998 , the route included a 1 @.@ 9 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) section of Cassells Street extending into downtown North Bay . Highway 63 is 63 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 39 @.@ 5 mi ) long , situated entirely within Nipissing District . 
 Beginning in North Bay near Lake Nipissing , the source of the French River which flows down to Georgian Bay , Highway 63 travels east through suburbs . It exits the city and travels along the northern shores of Trout Lake , which serves as the headwaters of the Mattawa River , which flows into the Ottawa River and eventually the St. Lawrence River . The portion of Highway 63 west of Trout Lake travels between these water systems . 
 The highway curves northeast to pass through the communities of <unk> and later Redbridge and Balsam Creek , after which it enters thick wilderness dominated by the Canadian Shield and Boreal Forest , with few residences or services outside of communities . It meanders northward , meeting the northern end of Highway 533 , which travels south to Mattawa , approximately two @-@ thirds of the distance between North Bay and the Quebec border . For the remainder of the highway , the route passes through isolated forests , travelling north , then curving east towards the Ottawa River . It passes through the community of <unk> before turning north alongside the river , following it up through Thorne . North of Thorne , the highway turns east and crosses the river into Quebec , becoming Route 101 and entering Témiscaming .

 On August 25 , 1937 , the North Bay – Témiscaming Road was assumed by the DHO as Highway 63 , connecting Highway 11 ( Main Street ) in downtown North Bay with the Ontario – Quebec border at Témiscaming . The road existed prior to this point as a northern development road . However , on April 1 , 1937 , the DND merged into the DHO . As a result , numerous highways were assumed in the northern regions of Ontario in mid @-@ 1937 . The highway remained unchanged for over 60 years , until January 1 , 1998 , when the Connecting Link agreement through North Bay from Main Street to Highway 11 / Highway 17 - the North Bay Bypass - was rescinded . As a result , Highway 63 was shortened by 1 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) .

 = Velvet belly lanternshark = 
 The velvet belly lanternshark ( or simply velvet belly , Etmopterus spinax ) is a species of dogfish shark in the family Etmopteridae . One of the most common deepwater sharks in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean , the velvet belly is found from Iceland and Norway to Gabon and South Africa at a depth of 20 – 2 @,@ 490 m ( 66 – 8 @,@ 169 ft ) . A small shark generally no more than 45 cm ( 18 in ) long , the velvet belly is so named because its black underside is abruptly distinct from the brown coloration on the rest of its body . The body of this species is fairly stout , with a moderately long snout and tail , and very small gill slits . Like other <unk> , the velvet belly is bioluminescent , with light @-@ emitting photophores forming a species @-@ specific pattern over its flanks and abdomen . These photophores are thought to function in counter @-@ illumination , which camouflages the shark against predators . They may also play a role in social interactions . 
 Young velvet bellies feed mainly on krill and small bony fish , transitioning to squid and shrimp as they grow larger . There is evidence that individuals also move into deeper water as they age . This species exhibits a number of adaptations to living in the deep sea , such as specialized T @-@ cells and liver proteins for dealing with the higher concentrations of heavy metals found there . Velvet bellies often carry a heavy parasite load . It is ovoviviparous , giving birth to litters of six to 20 young every two to three years . This species has virtually no commercial value , but large numbers are caught as bycatch in deepwater commercial fisheries . Although it has been assessed as of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature , the heavy fishing pressure throughout its range and its slow reproductive rate are raising conservation concerns . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The velvet belly was originally described as Squalus spinax by Swedish natural historian Carl Linnaeus , known as the " father of taxonomy " , in the 1758 tenth edition of Systema Naturae . He did not designate a type specimen ; the specific epithet spinax is in reference to the spiny dorsal fins . This species was later moved to the genus Etmopterus via the synonymy of Constantine Samuel Rafinesque 's Etmopterus aculeatus with Squalus spinax . 
 The velvet belly is grouped with the Caribbean lanternshark ( E. <unk> ) , <unk> lanternshark ( E. schultzi ) , brown lanternshark ( E. unicolor ) , <unk> lanternshark ( E. <unk> ) , combtooth lanternshark ( E. <unk> ) , and dwarf lanternshark ( E. perryi ) in having irregularly arranged , needle @-@ shaped dermal denticles . Its common name comes from this shark 's black ventral surface , which is sharply delineated from the rest of its body like a patch of velvet . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The range of the velvet belly is in the eastern Atlantic , extending from Iceland and Norway to Gabon , including the Mediterranean Sea , the Azores , the Canary Islands , and Cape Verde . It has also been reported off Cape Province , South Africa . This shark mainly inhabits the outer continental and insular shelves and upper slopes over mud or clay , from close to the bottom to the middle of the water column . It is most common at a depth of 200 – 500 m ( 660 – 1 @,@ 640 ft ) , though in the Rockall Trough , it is only found at a depth of 500 – 750 m ( 1 @,@ 640 – 2 @,@ 460 ft ) . This species has been reported from as shallow as 20 m ( 66 ft ) , and as deep as 2 @,@ 490 m ( 8 @,@ 170 ft ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The velvet belly is a robustly built shark with a moderately long , broad , flattened snout . The mouth has thin , smooth lips . The upper teeth are small , with a narrow central cusp and usually fewer than three pairs of lateral cusplets . The lower teeth are much larger , with a strongly slanted , blade @-@ like cusp at the top and interlocking bases . The five pairs of gill slits are tiny , comparable in size to the spiracles . Both dorsal fins bear stout , grooved spines at the front , with the second much longer than the first and curved . The first dorsal fin originates behind the short and rounded pectoral fins ; the second dorsal fin is twice the size of the first and originates behind the pelvic fins . The anal fin is absent . The tail is slender , leading to a long caudal fin with a small lower lobe and a low upper lobe with a prominent ventral notch near the tip . 
 The dermal denticles are thin with hooked tips , arranged without a regular pattern well @-@ separated from one another . The coloration is brown above , abruptly transitioning to black below . There are thin black marks above and behind the pelvic fins , and along the caudal fin . The velvet belly possesses numerous photophores that emit a blue @-@ green light visible from 3 – 4 m ( 9 @.@ 8 – 13 @.@ 1 ft ) away . Varying densities of photophores are arranged in nine patches on the shark 's sides and belly , creating a pattern unique to this species : photophores are present along the lateral line , scattered beneath the head but excluding the mouth , evenly on the belly , and concentrated around the pectoral fins and beneath the caudal peduncle . The maximum reported length is 60 cm ( 24 in ) , although few are longer than 45 cm ( 18 in ) . Females are larger than males . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Along with the blackmouth catshark ( Galeus melastomus ) and the Portuguese dogfish ( Centroscymnus coelolepis ) , the velvet belly is one of the most abundant deep @-@ sea sharks in the northeastern Atlantic . It is found individually or in small shoals . <unk> in the Mediterranean have found females outnumbering males across all ages ; this imbalance increases in the older age classes . In the Rockall Trough and the Catalan Sea , large adults are found in deeper waters than juveniles , which may serve to reduce competition between the two groups . However , this pattern has not been observed at other sites in the eastern Mediterranean . 
 The velvet belly 's liver accounts for 17 % of its body mass , three @-@ quarters of which is oil , making it nearly neutrally buoyant . To deal with the higher concentrations of heavy metals in the deep sea , the velvet belly has T @-@ cells in its bloodstream that can identify and mark toxic compounds for elimination . These T @-@ cells are produced by a <unk> gland in its esophagus called a " <unk> 's organ " , which is also found in some other sharks and rays . In its liver , specialized proteins are also capable of detoxifying cadmium , copper , mercury , zinc , and other toxic contaminants . The velvet belly 's bioluminescence is thought to function in counter @-@ illumination , which eliminates the shark 's silhouette and camouflages it from upward @-@ looking predators . Its bioluminescence may also serve a social function , such as finding mates or co @-@ ordinating groups , as the pattern is species @-@ specific . The velvet belly is an important food of larger fishes such as other sharks ; a major predator of this species is the <unk> skate ( Dipturus <unk> ) . 
 Numerous parasites are known for this species , and both juveniles and adults often carry heavy parasite loads . Known internal parasites include the monogenean <unk> <unk> , the tapeworms <unk> norvegicus , Lacistorhynchus tenuis , and Phyllobothrium <unk> , and the nematodes Anisakis simplex and Hysterothylacium <unk> . Some of these parasites use the velvet belly 's prey as intermediate hosts and are acquired via ingestion , while others use the shark itself as an intermediate host . The barnacle <unk> <unk> , an external parasite , attaches to the shark 's dorsal spine socket and penetrates deeply into the muscle , in the process often providing an attachment site for a second ( and rarely a third ) barnacle . Infestation by this barnacle reduces its host 's fecundity by impairing the development of the reproductive organs . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 As generalist predators , velvet bellies feed on crustaceans ( e.g. <unk> shrimp and krill ) , cephalopods ( e.g. <unk> squid and <unk> ) , and bony fishes ( e.g. <unk> , barracudinas , lanternfishes , and pouts ) . Sharks off Italy also eat small amounts of nematodes , polychaete worms , and other cartilaginous fishes . Studies of velvet bellies off Norway and Portugal , and in the Rockall Trough , have found small sharks under 27 cm ( 11 in ) long feed mainly on the krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica and the small fish Maurolicus muelleri . As the sharks grow larger , their diets become more varied , consisting mainly of squid and the shrimp <unk> tarda , as well fishes other than M. muelleri . It has been speculated that smaller velvet bellies may be too slow to catch fast @-@ moving cephalopods . The cephalopod diet of adults overlaps with that of the Portuguese dogfish ; the latter species may avoid competition with the velvet belly by living in deeper water . The bite force exerted by the velvet belly is only around 1 N. 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 The velvet belly is ovoviviparous , with the embryos hatching inside the uterus and being sustained by a yolk sac . The reproductive cycle may be two to three years long , with ovulation occurring in early autumn , fertilization in the summer ( or possibly in the winter if females are capable of storing sperm ) , and parturition in late winter or early spring . The gestation period is under one year . The litter size is six to 20 , with the number of young increasing with female size . At birth , the young measure 12 – 14 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 5 in ) long . The shark 's bioluminescence develops before birth ; the yolk sac is fluorescent before any photophores have formed , suggesting the mother transfers luminescent materials to her offspring . The first luminous tissue appears when the embryo is 55 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) long , and the complete pattern is laid down by the time it is 95 mm ( 3 @.@ 7 in ) long . At birth , the young shark is already capable of counter @-@ illumination with 80 % of its ventral surface luminescent . 
 The growth rate of the velvet belly is slow , though faster than some other deep @-@ sea sharks , such as the <unk> <unk> shark ( Centrophorus squamosus ) or the <unk> <unk> ( Squalus <unk> ) . Males mature sexually at 28 – 33 cm ( 11 – 13 in ) long and females at 34 – 36 cm ( 13 – 14 in ) long . The average age at maturity is 4 @.@ 0 years for males and 4 @.@ 7 years for females , though four @-@ year @-@ old mature individuals of both sexes have been caught in the wild , along with immature females over eight years old . Males and females eight and 11 years old , respectively , have been caught in the wild ; the potential lifespan of this species has been estimated at 18 years for males and 22 years for females . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Throughout their range , substantial quantities of velvet bellies are caught as bycatch in bottom trawls meant for shrimp and lobsters , and deepwater longlines meant for other fish . Lacking commercial value , these sharks are almost always discarded with extremely high mortality , though occasionally they are dried and salted or made into fishmeal . The IUCN has listed the velvet belly under Least Concern overall , as its population remains stable across much of its range , and it is afforded some protection in the Mediterranean from a 2005 ban on bottom trawling below 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) . However , in the northeastern Atlantic it has been assessed as Near Threatened , as its numbers have declined by almost 20 % from 1970 to 1998 – 2004 . The slow reproductive rate of this species limits its capacity to recover from population depletion . 
 = Angus McDonald ( Virginia militiaman ) = 
 Angus McDonald ( 1727 – August 19 , 1778 ) was a prominent Scottish American military officer , frontiersman , sheriff and landowner in Virginia . 
 During the Jacobite rising of 1745 , McDonald fought as a lieutenant under the command of Charles Edward Stuart in the Battle of Culloden , after which he was " attainted of treason " . He fled Scotland , departing from Inverness for the Colony of Virginia in 1746 at the age of 18 . Following his arrival in Virginia , McDonald worked as a merchant in Falmouth for two or three years . 
 McDonald moved west into Virginia 's interior and entered the military service of the colonial government under Lieutenant Governor Robert Dinwiddie , receiving the rank of captain . McDonald served in the French and Indian War under General John Forbes , in which he was in command of a company of Scottish Highlanders . Following the war , McDonald retired with the rank of captain in 1763 . 
 In 1765 , McDonald returned to military service when he was commissioned by Thomas Fairfax , 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron as a major in command of the Frederick County militia . Lord Fairfax also appointed McDonald as an attorney and land agent for his Northern Neck Proprietary . 
 Governor John Murray , 4th Earl of Dunmore commissioned McDonald in 1774 as a ranking military officer of an expedition ( known as " McDonald 's Expedition " ) to promptly organize and recruit settlers west of the Allegheny Mountains to defend settlements from Native American attacks . McDonald completed the expedition , which met its goal of temporarily relieving western Virginia frontier settlements from attack . 
 McDonald received a personal letter from General George Washington in 1777 appointing him a lieutenant colonel in a battalion of Thruston 's Additional Continental Regiment under the command of Colonel Charles Mynn Thruston . Despite his loyalty to the American Revolutionary cause , McDonald refused Washington 's appointment . McDonald was later appointed by Washington to serve as a lieutenant colonel in command of Virginia revolutionary militia forces during the American Revolutionary War . He also served on various revolutionary committees throughout the war .

 Angus McDonald was born in 1727 in the Scottish Highlands . He was an immediate family member of a chief of the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry , whose clan seat was <unk> Castle . He was probably the son of Angus McDonald , who was a younger son of Alastair Dubh McDonald , the commander of the Glengarry clan in the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689 during the early Jacobite risings . McDonald was a lineal descendant of a long line of military heroes of the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry and of Somerled , Lord of the Isles . McDonald was raised and educated in Glasgow . During the Jacobite rising of 1745 , McDonald fought as a lieutenant under the command of Charles Edward Stuart in the Battle of Culloden , after which he was " attainted of treason " . He fled Scotland , departing from Inverness for the Colony of Virginia in 1746 at the age of 18 .

 McDonald arrived in Virginia at the port of Falmouth on the Rappahannock River . Among the belongings he brought with him were the short sword , sash and gorget bearing the Glengarry coat of arms that he had worn at the Battle of Culloden . Following his arrival , McDonald remained in Falmouth for two or three years where he worked as a merchant . McDonald moved west into Virginia 's interior and entered the military service of the colonial government under Lieutenant Governor Robert Dinwiddie , receiving the rank of captain . In return for his " meritorious service " in conflicts against Native Americans , McDonald received 400 acres ( 1 @.@ 6 km2 ) of land from the colonial government of Virginia in 1754 . Around that same year , McDonald moved further west to the settlement of Winchester where he established the first Masonic Lodge in 1760 . While in Winchester , McDonald served as a member of the Committee of Safety . 
 McDonald served in the French and Indian War under General John Forbes in which he was in command of a company of Scottish Highlanders . McDonald and his company marched against Fort Duquesne in the autumn of 1758 . Following the war , McDonald retired with the rank of captain in 1763 . Upon his retirement , Governor John Murray , 4th Earl of Dunmore granted McDonald an additional 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 8 @.@ 1 km2 ) of land , which were surveyed by Hancock Taylor . On October 29 , 1762 , prior to his land grant from Lord Dunmore , McDonald purchased 370 acres ( 1 @.@ 5 km2 ) from Brian Bruin east of Winchester on which he built the original McDonald family residence in the region , which he named Glengarry after his ancestral homeland . 
 In 1765 , McDonald returned to military service when he was commissioned by Thomas Fairfax , 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron as a major in command of the Frederick County militia . That same year , Lord Fairfax appointed McDonald as an attorney and land agent for his Northern Neck Proprietary . By 1769 , McDonald was a magistrate of the Frederick County court along with associate magistrates Lord Fairfax , Samuel Washington ( brother of George Washington ) , Warner Washington ( Washington 's first cousin ) , Taverner Beale and Reverend Charles Mynn Thruston . 
 In early 1774 , McDonald participated in an expedition surveying the " military bounty lands " lying along the Ohio and Kanawha rivers to be granted by the colonial government of Virginia to soldiers and officers in exchange for their military service in the French and Indian War . The expedition was cut short due to hostilities with Native Americans , and McDonald provided an account of these hostilities and reports he received of attacks against settlers to Lord Dunmore . McDonald 's accounts along with those of other settlers resulted in Lord Dunmore 's decision to wage a war against the Native Americans to pacify the frontier lands of western Virginia for continued settlement . 
 = = = McDonald 's Expedition and Dunmore 's War = = = 
 In early June of 1774 , Lord Dunmore further commissioned McDonald as a ranking military officer of an expedition ( known as " McDonald 's Expedition " ) to promptly organize and recruit settlers west of the Allegheny Mountains along the Youghiogheny and Monongahela rivers in order to defend European American settlements from Native American attacks . Lord Dunmore commissioned Michael Cresap as a captain under McDonald 's command and placed him in charge of the enlistment of a force from Hampshire County . McDonald and Cresap 's combined forces numbered approximately 400 men following their convergence near present @-@ day Wheeling on the Ohio River . In addition to Cresap , other captains in the expedition included Michael Cresap , Jr . , Hancock Lee , Daniel Morgan , James Wood and Henry Hoagland . 
 Once the entire force had converged near Wheeling , McDonald and Captain William Crawford directed the construction of Fort Fincastle in July 1774 . Following the erection of the stockade , McDonald ordered each of his soldiers to pack seven days ' worth of provisions . On July 26 , 1774 , his forces crossed the Ohio River at the mouth of Fish Creek about 24 miles ( 39 km ) south of Fort Fincastle . McDonald 's forces continued down the Ohio River in boats and canoes until they reached the mouth of <unk> Creek , from which they marched toward the Shawnee villages of Wakatomika ( also known as Wapatomica ) near the mouth of Wakatomika Creek ( modern @-@ day Dresden , Ohio ) on the Muskingum River . McDonald 's forces had not encountered any enemy Native American forces on their expedition until about 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from Wakatomika , where they were ambushed by a force of approximately 30 to 50 Shawnee arranged in columns at the head of a swampy crossing . The ambush resulted in the deaths of two soldiers and the wounding of up to eight or nine more . 
 Following the ambush , McDonald and his forces reached the Muskingum River around nightfall on August 2 , 1774 . McDonald and his forces arrived at the " chief Wakatomika town " only to discover that it had been evacuated by its Shawnee inhabitants , who were found nearby preparing to ambush McDonald 's forces . The Shawnee in <unk> surrendered to McDonald in exchange for peace . McDonald 's forces continued their march onto the next Wakatomika settlement , where a further ambush ensued resulting in the burning of Shawnee cabins and villages . The ambush also resulted in the destruction of Shawnee plantations and maize fields . McDonald and his forces took three Shawnee scalps and one prisoner . McDonald and his forces returned to Wheeling with three Shawnee tribal chiefs as captives , who were then sent on to the colonial Virginia seat of government , Williamsburg . McDonald completed the expedition , which met its goal of temporarily relieving western Virginia frontier settlements from Native American attack . He continued to serve under Lord Dunmore until the end of the war . In a letter dated January 8 , 1775 , following his return to Winchester from Williamsburg , McDonald recounted of the war , " all the Country is well pleased with the <unk> Expeditions . " Following Dunmore 's War in December 1774 , McDonald was further promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel . 
 On August 6 , 1776 , McDonald was appointed and took the oath of the sheriff and justice of Frederick County by the county court under an ordinance of the Virginia Convention of 1776 . While serving as sheriff , he was placed in command of the militias of both Augusta and Frederick counties . At the time of his command of the Frederick and Augusta militias , the two counties encompassed much of the territory of Virginia between the Ohio River , the Tennessee boundary and the Blue Ridge Mountains , with the exception of Hampshire County which had been created from parts of Frederick and Augusta counties in 1754 . 
 = = American Revolutionary War = = 
 During the onset of the American Revolution , McDonald was an ardent Whig . In March 1777 , McDonald received a personal letter from General George Washington appointing him a lieutenant colonel in a battalion of Thruston 's Additional Continental Regiment under the command of Colonel Charles Mynn Thruston , a former rector of Cunningham Chapel in present @-@ day Clarke County , Virginia , and a former associate magistrate of the Frederick County court , where he served alongside McDonald . Despite his loyalty to the American Revolutionary cause , McDonald refused the appointment for either of two reasons : he would have been second @-@ in @-@ command to a colonel lacking prior military experience and McDonald had previously been a member of the vestry of Cunningham Chapel and resigned following a dispute with Thruston over " a matter of business with the church " . General Adam Stephen , a fellow Scotsman , wrote a letter to McDonald dated March 15 , 1777 , in which he implored him to accept Washington 's appointment , stating " Your appointment comes entirely from your own merit . " Stephen warned McDonald not to let his " Highland pride " dissuade him from serving under Thruston and in the event McDonald still refused Washington 's offer , Stephen wrote : " Write a polite letter to General Washington thanking his excellency for his notice and making the best excuse you can . " 
 McDonald was later appointed by Washington to serve as a lieutenant colonel in command of Virginia revolutionary militia forces during the American Revolutionary War . He also served on various revolutionary committees throughout the war . McDonald died on August 19 , 1778 , at his home Glengarry near Winchester after receiving an incorrect dosage of the medication potassium <unk> tartrate .

 An article published in the Winchester Star in 1967 said of McDonald , " fearsome or not , he founded in the Shenandoah Valley a dynasty of military men as distinguished as their forebears had been in the Scottish Highlands .

 McDonald married Anna Thompson ( 1748 – about 1832 ) of Hancock , Maryland on June 20 , 1766 . Anna was a daughter of John Thompson and his wife , <unk> Eltinge . The Eltinge family was of Dutch descent . McDonald and his wife had seven children , four sons and three daughters :

 = The Host ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " The Host " is the second episode of the second season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on September 23 , 1994 . It was written by Chris Carter , directed by Daniel Sackheim , and featured guest appearances by Darin Morgan . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " The Host " earned a Nielsen household rating of 9 @.@ 8 , being watched by 9 @.@ 3 million households in its initial broadcast . The episode received positive reviews , praising the creepiness of the villain . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In the episode , Mulder and Scully investigate a body found in sewage after being reassigned to different departments . Their inquiry results in the discovery of a bizarre fluke @-@ like man — the product of the Chernobyl disaster — that soon goes on a rampage in the sewers of New Jersey . 
 Series creator Chris Carter claimed to have been inspired to write the episode based on three incidents ; his dog having worms , his readings about Chernobyl , and the extinction of species during the 1990s . The Flukeman character was portrayed by Darin Morgan , brother of executive producer Glen Morgan . Darin Morgan would become a staff writer for the show later in the second season . In addition , " The Host " also introduced the character of X , the successor of Mulder 's former Syndicate informant Deep Throat . 
 = = Plot = = 
 On a Russian freighter off the coast of New Jersey , a crewman trying to fix the ship 's toilets is pulled into the septic system . His half @-@ eaten body appears in the sewers of Newark days later . Fox Mulder is assigned the case and visits with a Detective Norman in Newark , being shown the still @-@ unidentified body . Mulder angrily confronts Assistant Director Walter Skinner , feeling he has been given the seeming " wild goose chase " as a form of punishment . 
 That night , Mulder talks to Dana Scully , telling her that he 's thinking of leaving the FBI . He shoots down Scully 's idea that he request a transfer to Quantico , believing the FBI doesn 't want them working together . Scully performs the autopsy on the crewman 's body , finding a Russian language tattoo on his arm and a flukeworm inside his liver . 
 In Newark , a city worker named Craig is pulled underwater in the sewers but is rescued by his co @-@ worker . He believes he was attacked by a python . He decides to visit a doctor ( with Mulder observing ) and complains of a weird taste in his mouth . An abnormal four @-@ pointed wound appears on his back during a medical examination in Sayreville , New Jersey . Scully shows Mulder the flukeworm she found , whose mouth , though much smaller , matches the wound on the city worker 's back . Mulder receives a call from a mysterious man telling him he has a friend at the FBI . That night , the city worker coughs up a flukeworm in his shower and dies . Mulder visits a sewage processing plant and finds a large humanoid with a fluke @-@ like mouth . 
 At Quantico , someone slips a newspaper article under Scully 's door enabling her to identify the original body as a crew member on a Russian ship . Mulder and Scully meet at the processing plant and they look at the strange , fluke @-@ like man . Skinner wants to prosecute the creature and subject it to a psychiatric evaluation , which Mulder thinks would be difficult . Skinner tells Mulder of Craig 's death and admits that this would have been an X @-@ File had they still been open . Mulder raises his discontentment claiming that with X @-@ Files , a certain pair of agents could have saved a life . Skinner simply responds saying everyone takes their orders from someone , implying the decision was not his and came from higher up the chain of command . 
 That night workers put the flukeman into a U.S. Marshal 's van , but it kills the driver and escapes to a local campsite . The flukeman hides in a portable toilet and is pulled into a truck the next day when the toilet is drained . Mulder receives another phone call from the mysterious caller . When he questions Scully about it , she denies any involvement . The flukeman is brought back to the processing plant . Scully believes that the flukeworm she found in the body is a larva , attempting to reproduce . One of the men at the processing plant is pulled underwater by the flukeman while investigating a storm drain overflow . Mulder heads in and saves him , apparently killing the flukeman by closing a sewer grate on it , slicing it in half . Scully concludes her investigation , thinking that the creature was brought to the U.S. by a Russian freighter that was hauling salvage from Chernobyl , and that the creature was created in a ' soup ' of radioactive sewage . Elsewhere , the flukeman 's remains open its eyes .

 In the 2013 comic continuation of The X @-@ Files called Season 10 two stories — " Hosts " , part one and two — continued on the story of " The Host " almost twenty years later after the events of this episode . According to the comics , the Flukeman escaped and travelled to Martha 's Vineyard where it began to multiply , abducting multiple beach @-@ goers . The Flukeman and his offspring were nearly all killed , however , by local sheriff Michael Simmons ( who later told the agents in " Hosts , Part 2 " that his real name was Mikhail Simonov and he served as one of the Soviet Army 's liquidators during the Chernobyl disaster ) . In addition , " Hosts , Part 2 " expanded upon the backstory of the Flukeman , revealing that he was a Soviet liquidator named Gregory , who , after being locked in a sewerage tanker truck in Chernobyl , mutated into the original Flukeman after he was exposed to irradiated cooling water from the still @-@ burning Reactor No. 4 and to flatworms in the sewerage tank .

 Chris Carter claimed to have been inspired to write the episode after his dog had worms , a situation he called " very disgusting " . He also had been reading about Chernobyl and the extinction of species at the time and blended all three of these concepts when writing the episode . Carter described his mood while writing the episode , " I was in a funk when I wrote that episode . We were coming back from hiatus and I was trying to find something more interesting than just the Flukeman . I was irritated at the time and I brought my irritation to Mulder 's attitude . Basically , he had become fed up with the FBI . They had given him what he felt was a low assignment , which was sending him into the city after a dead body . But lo and behold , he finds that this is a case that for all intents and purposes is an X @-@ File . It 's been given to him by a man he 's never looked at as an ally , Skinner . So it 's an interesting establishing of a relationship between them . " Producer J.P. Finn described the episode as a departure from Carter 's usual work as it did not deal with an alien subject matter . 
 = = = Casting and filming = = = 
 The Flukeman — also known affectionately as " <unk> " by the cast and crew — was portrayed by Darin Morgan , brother of executive producer Glen Morgan . He would become a staff writer for the show later in the second season . The Flukeman suit used by Morgan , which included flipper @-@ like feet , yellow contact lenses , and fake teeth , took six hours to put on ; this process was eventually sped up . Morgan wore the suit as much as 20 consecutive hours during shooting . As a result , he was forced to go to the bathroom while still wearing the suit . Morgan was rarely on set without being in full costume , and recalled that when he met up with David Duchovny again upon joining the series ' writing staff , the actor had no idea who he was , despite having enjoyed an amiable relationship with the costumed Morgan previously . The suit dissolved in water , forcing special effects artist Toby Lindala to reconstruct the suit each day . Because the suit did not permit Morgan to breathe through his nose , he was unable to eat while wearing it . Carter described the character as " the embodiment of everyone 's sense of vulnerability , the idea of something that exists in the underworld of the sewer system and might in fact come to bite you in the least elegant of places " . The original intention was showing even less of the Flukeman , but some angles and lighting ended up revealing more of the creature 's design . Carter still felt it helped to " get more creepy " , as the Flukeman is not shown fully until the final scenes . 
 The sewer processing plant scenes were shot at Iona Island Sewage Treatment plant in Canada . The sewer scenes were shot in a pit on the show 's stage , with Carter using his father , who worked as a construction worker , as a consultant on how to build it . As no ship was available for filming the opening scenes in the Russian freighter , a hydro sub station in Surrey , British Columbia was adapted into an engine room . Carter had to fight with Fox 's broadcast standards department over the scene where a victim vomits up a flukeworm while in the shower . James Wong described it as the grossest piece of television ever put on the air . As Gillian Anderson 's pregnancy was getting more apparent , the producers started to shoot Scully 's scenes in a way it would be disguised , with " very fancy trick angles , trench coats , and scenes where she is seated rather than standing " .

 " The Host " premiered on the Fox network on September 23 , 1994 , and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on September 4 , 1995 . This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 9 @.@ 8 , with a 17 share , meaning that roughly 9 @.@ 8 percent of all television @-@ equipped households , and 17 percent of households watching television , were tuned in to the episode . It was viewed by 9 @.@ 3 million households . 
 The episode received glowing praise from critics . Entertainment Weekly gave " The Host " a rare A + , noting that it was " a refreshing instance of a fully and satisfactorily resolved episode — like a perfect meal , although you definitely don 't want to eat during this one . " Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club described the episode as " the first really , really icky X @-@ Files " , and while considering redundant the " circular " nature of the plot , with the creature coming back to the sewers after escaping , he felt that " The Host " " holds up because of the Flukeman 's irreconcilable ugliness , and because it continues down the path that " Little Green Men " started on " . On a more negative view , Critical Myth 's John Keegan gave the episode 6 / 10 , considering that " as fun as this episode can be , there are some places were it just doesn ’ t quite add up " , criticizing writing elements such as the lack of resolution , the explanation for the Flukeman 's origins , and the " heavy @-@ handed " introduction of X. A writer from the Vancouver Sun listed " The Host " as one of the best stand alone episodes of the show , saying that it broke the " B @-@ movie fun at best " quality of most X @-@ Files standalone episodes , saying that " thanks to its cinema @-@ grade made @-@ up effects , claustrophobic sets and chilling subject matter , this Chris Carter @-@ penned episode not only took the show to new heights of horror and suspense , it offered a fresh alternative on network television " . " The Host " was later picked for the 2008 DVD The X @-@ Files : Revelations , with eight episodes Chris Carter considered " essential grounding " for the film The X @-@ Files : I Want to Believe . The plot for the episode was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Les Martin . 
 The Flukeman character has also attracted positive criticism . Writing for Den of Geek , John Moore listed the Flukeman as one of his " Top 10 X @-@ Files Baddies " , writing that " the idea of a man size biter running around drains in a city near me – looking like a giant , fanged maggot - was always likely to induce a goodly amount of cheek @-@ shifting on the sofa . " The A.V. Club 's Zack Handlen described the flukeman as a " beyond icky " monster that " just looks wrong " , adding that " the plain fact of its existence is horrifying enough that it doesn 't need to do more " . Connie Ogle from PopMatters ranked the character among the " best " monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week , describing it as " something of a poster boy for XF villains , " and considering that " never has toxic waste seemed so dangerous as when the big slimy white fellow slithers onto the screen and starts attacking people in the sewers .

 = Subcutaneous emphysema = 
 Subcutaneous emphysema is when gas or air is in the layer under the skin . Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the skin , and emphysema refers to trapped air . It is sometimes abbreviated SCE or SE and also called tissue emphysema , or Sub Q air . Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity , subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest , neck and face , where it is able to travel from the chest cavity along the fascia . Subcutaneous emphysema has a characteristic crackling feel to the touch , a sensation that has been described as similar to touching Rice Krispies ; this sensation of air under the skin is known as subcutaneous <unk> . 
 Numerous etiologies of subcutaneous emphysema have been described . <unk> was first recognized as a medical entity by Laennec , who reported it as a consequence of trauma in 1819 . Later , in 1939 , at The Johns Hopkins Hospital , Dr. Louis Hamman described it in postpartum woman ; indeed , subcutaneous emphysema is sometimes known as Hamman 's syndrome . However , in some medical circles , it can instead be more commonly known as Macklin 's Syndrome after L. Macklin , in 1939 , and M.T. and C.C. Macklin , in 1944 , who cumulatively went on to describe the pathophysiology in more detail . 
 Subcutaneous emphysema can result from puncture of parts of the respiratory or gastrointestinal systems . Particularly in the chest and neck , air may become trapped as a result of penetrating trauma ( e.g. , gunshot wounds or stab wounds ) or blunt trauma . Infection ( e.g. , gas gangrene ) can cause gas to be trapped in the subcutaneous tissues . Subcutaneous emphysema can be caused by medical procedures and medical conditions that cause the pressure in the alveoli of the lung to be higher than that in the tissues outside of them . Its most common causes are pneumothorax and a chest tube that has become occluded by a blood clot or fibrinous material . It can also occur spontaneously due to rupture of the alveoli with dramatic presentation . When the condition is caused by surgery it is called surgical emphysema . The term spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema is used when the cause is not clear . Subcutaneous emphysema is not typically dangerous in and of itself , however it can be a symptom of very dangerous underlying conditions , such as pneumothorax . Although the underlying conditions require treatment , subcutaneous emphysema usually does not ; small amounts of air are reabsorbed by the body . However , subcutaneous emphysema can be uncomfortable and may interfere with breathing , and is often treated by removing air from the tissues , for example by using large bore needles , skin incisions or subcutaneous catheterization . 
 = = Symptoms and signs = = 
 Signs and symptoms of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema vary based on the cause , but it is often associated with swelling of the neck and chest pain , and may also involve sore throat , neck pain , difficulty swallowing , wheezing and difficulty breathing . Chest X @-@ rays may show air in the mediastinum , the middle of the chest cavity . A significant case of subcutaneous emphysema is easy to detect by touching the overlying skin ; it feels like tissue paper or Rice Krispies . Touching the bubbles causes them to move and sometimes make a crackling noise . The air bubbles , which are painless and feel like small nodules to the touch , may burst when the skin above them is <unk> . The tissues surrounding SCE are usually swollen . When large amounts of air leak into the tissues , the face can swell considerably . In cases of subcutaneous emphysema around the neck , there may be a feeling of fullness in the neck , and the sound of the voice may change . If SCE is particularly extreme around the neck and chest , the swelling can interfere with breathing . The air can travel to many parts of the body , including the abdomen and limbs , because there are no separations in the fatty tissue in the skin to prevent the air from moving . 
 = = Causes = = 
 = = = Trauma = = = 
 Conditions that cause subcutaneous emphysema may result from both blunt and penetrating trauma ; SCE is often the result of a stabbing or gunshot wound . Subcutaneous emphysema is often found in car accident victims because of the force of the crash . 
 Chest trauma , a major cause of subcutaneous emphysema , can cause air to enter the skin of the chest wall from the neck or lung . When the pleural membranes are punctured , as occurs in penetrating trauma of the chest , air may travel from the lung to the muscles and subcutaneous tissue of the chest wall . When the alveoli of the lung are ruptured , as occurs in pulmonary laceration , air may travel beneath the visceral pleura ( the membrane lining the lung ) , to the hilum of the lung , up to the trachea , to the neck and then to the chest wall . The condition may also occur when a fractured rib punctures a lung ; in fact , 27 % of patients who have rib fractures also have subcutaneous emphysema . Rib fractures may tear the parietal pleura , the membrane lining the inside of chest wall , allowing air to escape into the subcutaneous tissues . 
 Subcutaneous emphysema is frequently found in pneumothorax ( air outside of the lung in the chest cavity ) and may also result from air in the mediastinum , <unk> ( air in the pericardial cavity around the heart ) . A tension pneumothorax , in which air builds up in the pleural cavity and exerts pressure on the organs within the chest , makes it more likely that air will enter the subcutaneous tissues through pleura torn by a broken rib . When subcutaneous emphysema results from pneumothorax , air may enter tissues including those of the face , neck , chest , armpits , or abdomen . 
 When subcutaneous emphysema occurs with pneumomediastinum , the condition is known as Hamman 's syndrome . <unk> can result from a number of events . For example , foreign body aspiration , in which someone inhales an object , can cause pneumomediastinum ( and lead to subcutaneous emphysema ) by puncturing the airways or by increasing the pressure in the affected lung ( s ) enough to cause them to burst . 
 Subcutaneous emphysema of the chest wall is commonly among the first signs to appear that barotrauma , damage caused by excessive pressure , has occurred , and it is an indication that the lung was subjected to significant barotrauma . Thus the phenomenon may occur in diving injuries . 
 Trauma to parts of the respiratory system other than the lungs , such as rupture of a bronchial tube , may also cause subcutaneous emphysema . Air may travel upward to the neck from a pneumomediastinum that results from a bronchial rupture , or downward from a torn trachea or larynx into the soft tissues of the chest . It may also occur with fractures of the facial bones , neoplasms , during asthma attacks , when the Heimlich maneuver is used , and during childbirth . It is estimated to occur with pneumomediastinum in one in every 2000 – 100 @,@ 000 deliveries . Injury with pneumatic tools , those that are driven by air , is also known to cause subcutaneous emphysema , even in extremities ( the arms and legs ) . It can also occur as a result of rupture of the esophagus ; when it does , it is usually as a late sign . 
 = = = Medical treatment = = = 
 Subcutaneous emphysema is a common result of certain types of surgery ; for example it is not unusual in chest surgery . It may also occur from surgery around the esophagus , and is particularly likely in prolonged surgery . Other potential causes are positive pressure ventilation for any reason and by any technique , in which its occurrence is frequently unexpected . It may also occur as a result of oral surgery , laparoscopy , and cricothyrotomy . In a pneumonectomy , in which an entire lung is removed , the remaining bronchial stump may leak air , a rare but very serious condition that leads to progressive subcutaneous emphysema . Air can leak out of the pleural space through an incision made for a thoracotomy to cause subcutaneous emphysema . On infrequent occasions , the condition can result from dental surgery , usually due to use of high @-@ speed tools that are air driven . These cases result in usually painless swelling of the face and neck , with an immediate onset , the crepitus ( crunching sound ) typical of subcutaneous emphysema , and often with subcutaneous air visible on X @-@ ray . 
 One of the main causes of subcutaneous emphysema , along with pneumothorax , is an improperly functioning chest tube . Thus subcutaneous emphysema is often a sign that something is wrong with a chest tube ; it may be clogged , clamped , or out of place . The tube may need to be replaced , or , when large amounts of air are leaking , a new tube may be added . 
 Since mechanical ventilation can worsen a pneumothorax , it can force air into the tissues ; when subcutaneous emphysema occurs in a ventilated patient , it is an indication that the ventilation may have caused a pneumothorax . It is not unusual for subcutaneous emphysema to result from positive pressure ventilation . Another possible cause is a ruptured trachea . The trachea may be injured by tracheostomy or tracheal intubation ; in cases of tracheal injury , large amounts of air can enter the subcutaneous space . An endotracheal tube can puncture the trachea or bronchi and cause subcutaneous emphysema . 
 = = = Infection = = = 
 Air can be trapped under the skin in necrotizing infections such as gangrene , occurring as a late sign in gas gangrene , of which it is the hallmark sign . Subcutaneous emphysema is also considered a hallmark of <unk> gangrene . Symptoms of subcutaneous emphysema can result when infectious organisms produce gas by fermentation . When emphysema occurs due to infection , signs that the infection is systemic , i.e. that it has spread beyond the initial location , are also present . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 Air is able to travel to the soft tissues of the neck from the mediastinum and the <unk> ( the space behind the abdominal cavity ) because these areas are connected by fascial planes . From the punctured lungs or airways , the air travels up the <unk> sheaths and into the mediastinum , from which it can enter the subcutaneous tissues . 
 Spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema is thought to result from increased pressures in the lung that cause alveoli to rupture . In spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema , air travels from the ruptured alveoli into the <unk> and along the blood vessels of the lung , into the mediastinum and from there into the tissues of the neck or head . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Significant cases of subcutaneous emphysema are easy to diagnose because of the characteristic signs of the condition . In some cases , the signs are subtle , making diagnosis more difficult . Medical imaging is used to diagnose the condition or confirm a diagnosis made using clinical signs . On a chest radiograph , subcutaneous emphysema may be seen as radiolucent striations in the pattern expected from the pectoralis major muscle group . Air in the subcutaneous tissues may interfere with radiography of the chest , potentially obscuring serious conditions such as pneumothorax . It can also and reduce the effectiveness of chest ultrasound . On the other hand , since subcutaneous emphysema may become apparent in chest X @-@ rays before a pneumothorax does , its presence may be used to infer that of the latter injury . Subcutaneous emphysema can also be seen in CT scans , with the air pockets appearing as dark areas . CT scanning is so sensitive that it commonly makes it possible to find the exact spot from which air is entering the soft tissues . In 1994 , M.T. Macklin and C.C. Macklin published further insights into the pathophysiology of spontaneous Macklin 's Syndrome occurring from a severe asthmatic attack . 
 The presence of subcutaneous emphysema in a person who appears quite ill and febrile after bout of vomiting followed by left chest pain is very suggestive of the diagnosis of Boerhaave 's syndrome , which is a life @-@ threatening emergency caused by rupture of the distal esophagus . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 Subcutaneous emphysema is usually benign . Most of the time , SCE itself does not need treatment ( though the conditions from which it results may ) ; however , if the amount of air is large , it can interfere with breathing and be uncomfortable . It occasionally progresses to a state " Massive Subcutaneous <unk> " which is quite uncomfortable and requires surgical drainage . When the amount of air pushed out of the airways or lung becomes massive , usually due to positive pressure ventilation , the eyelids swell so much that the patient cannot see . Also the pressure of the air may impede the blood flow to the areolae of the breast and skin of the scrotum or labia . This can lead to necrosis of the skin in these areas . The latter are urgent situations requiring rapid , adequate decompression . Severe cases can compress the trachea and do require treatment . 
 In severe cases of subcutaneous emphysema , catheters can be placed in the subcutaneous tissue to release the air . Small cuts , or " blow holes " , may be made in the skin to release the gas . When subcutaneous emphysema occurs due to pneumothorax , a chest tube is frequently used to control the latter ; this eliminates the source of the air entering the subcutaneous space . If the volume of subcutaneous air is increasing , it may be that the chest tube is not removing air rapidly enough , so it may be replaced with a larger one . Suction may also be applied to the tube to remove air faster . The progression of the condition can be monitored by marking the boundaries with a special pencil for marking on skin . 
 Since treatment usually involves dealing with the underlying condition , cases of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema may require nothing more than bed rest , medication to control pain , and perhaps supplemental oxygen . Breathing oxygen may help the body to absorb the subcutaneous air more quickly . <unk> and observation are also part of treatment . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Air in subcutaneous tissue does not usually pose a lethal threat ; small amounts of air are reabsorbed by the body . Once the pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum that causes the subcutaneous emphysema is resolved , with or without medical intervention , the subcutaneous emphysema will usually clear . However , spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema can , in rare cases , progress to a life @-@ threatening condition , and subcutaneous emphysema due to mechanical ventilation may induce ventilatory failure . 
 = = History = = 
 The first report of subcutaneous emphysema resulting from air in the mediastinum was made in 1850 in a patient who had been coughing violently . In 1900 , the first recorded case of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema was reported in a bugler for the Royal Marines who had had a tooth extracted : playing the instrument had forced air through the hole where the tooth had been and into the tissues of his face . Since then , another case of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema was reported in a submariner for the US Navy who had had a root canal in the past ; the increased pressure in the submarine forced air through it and into his face . In recent years a case was reported at the University Hospital of Wales of a young man who had been coughing violently causing a rupture in the esophagus resulting in SE .

 The 105th Boat Race took place on 28 March 1959 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . It was won by Oxford by six lengths in a time of 18 minutes 52 seconds , their first victory in five years . The victory took the overall record to 58 – 46 in Cambridge 's favour . 
 During the build up to the race , a number of the returning Oxford crew attempted to oust both coach Jumbo Edwards and Oxford University Boat Club president Ronnie Howard . Cambridge stated that they would only row against the president 's crew and Oxford 's college boat club captains voted in favour of Howard .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and as of 2014 , broadcast worldwide . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1958 race by three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths , and led overall with 58 victories to Oxford 's 45 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . Cambridge had won the four previous races , and had lost only three times since the Second World War . 
 Cambridge were coached by Harry Almond ( who rowed for Cambridge in the 1950 and 1951 races ) , James Crowden ( who rowed twice for Cambridge , in the 1951 and 1952 races ) , Harold Rickett ( who rowed in the 1930 , 1931 and 1932 races ) and J. J. Vernon ( who rowed in the 1955 race ) . Oxford 's coach was Olympic rower " Jumbo " Edwards who rowed in the 1955 race . The race was umpired by George Douglas Clapperton who had coxed Oxford in the 1923 and 1924 races . He later umpired in the 1967 boat race . 
 The 1958 Dark Blue boat was " built around " 6 ft 4 in ( 1 @.@ 93 m ) tall Yale graduate Reed Rubin and the loss created friction , so much so that he and the other Oxford Blues suggested that Edwards should go to the United States to see the coaching methods that helped the successful Yale crew which contributed seven of the nine crew in the gold medal @-@ winning men 's eight at the 1956 Summer Olympics . Rubin himself stood for Oxford University Boat Club presidency against Ronnie Howard ( who had rowed for Isis the previous year ) . Although standing in opposition , Howard agreed with Rubin that more emphasis should be placed on technique than fitness training . Howard was elected , by a single vote , and took the responsibility of selecting both the coach and the crew . 
 In late 1958 , Rubin urged Howard to adopt the Yale training regime and to drop Edward for a Yale coach , or even Rubin himself . Howard refused , and Rubin decided to prepare of crew of his own which would include all six of the returning Blues and new recruits such as American Olympic gold medallist Charlie Grimes . He demanded of Howard that his " pirate " crew be allowed to train independently and challenged him to race for the right to represent Oxford in the Boat Race . Howard refused , stating of the mutineers " if they maintain their point of view I shall do without them ... I have no sympathy for these people " . At a meeting of boat club captains to discuss the future of the Torpids , Howard was presented with a letter offering him their full support . Cambridge University Boat Club president Mike Maltby , in an interview with student newspaper Varsity supported Howard by stating that the Light Blues would not row against any crew that did not have the full support of the Oxford president . Rubin stated that he would not row in Howard 's boat under any circumstances – the mutiny was quashed . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 12 st 13 @.@ 75 lb ( 82 @.@ 2 kg ) , 1 pound ( 0 @.@ 5 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . Oxford 's crew included four of the former rebels , Douglas @-@ Mann , Fage , Edwards and cox Julian <unk> . Cambridge saw three rowers with Boat Race experience return to the crew : J. R. Giles , D. C. Christie and Maltby . Cox James Sulley also returned to steer the boat for a second year . There were no non @-@ British registered participants in the race .

 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford . Clapperton started the race at 3 : 15 p.m. in good conditions with a light breeze . Although Cambridge started at a higher stroke rate , Oxford held a canvas @-@ length lead after the first minute . Still outrating the Dark Blues , Cambridge steered towards opponents who held a half @-@ length lead by Craven Steps . <unk> held his course , steering close to Beverley Brook , before taking a clear water advantage . Sulley dropped the Cambridge boat in behind Oxford , with a quarter of a length of open water between the two as they passed the Mile Post . The Dark Blues reduced their rating but still passed below Hammersmith Bridge with an eight @-@ second advantage . Despite a spurt from Maltby , Oxford reached Chiswick Steps twelve seconds ahead , and by Barnes Bridge were five lengths up . Oxford continued to draw away and won by six lengths in a time of 18 minutes 52 seconds . It was Oxford 's largest margin of victory since the 1912 race , and their fastest time since the 1911 race . 
 According to the rowing correspondent of The Times , " everything went exactly according to the book , an occurrence so rare that a good many people doubted that it could happen . " A writer for The Illustrated London News stated that " the result was a great triumph for Group Captain H. R. A. Edwards , Oxford 's sole coach , and for R. L. Howard , the Oxford President , who had to deal with the revolt — over rowing styles — in the Boat Club last autumn . "

 Injustice : Gods Among Us is a fighting video game based upon the fictional universe of DC Comics . The game was developed by NetherRealm Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , and Wii U. It was released in April 2013 in North America , Europe , and Australia , and June 2013 in Japan . An expanded version of the game , titled Injustice : Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition , was released in November 2013 for the PlayStation 3 , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation Vita , Xbox 360 , and Microsoft Windows . A free @-@ to @-@ play mobile app based on Injustice was also released for Android and iOS devices . 
 Players select one of several characters from the DC Universe to engage in combat , aiming to knock out their opponent . The game is set in a 2.5D environment ; while character models and backgrounds are rendered in three @-@ dimensional graphics , the characters are restricted to fight within a two @-@ dimensional space . Injustice builds upon several aspects from NetherRealm Studios ' previous title , Mortal Kombat , including its controls , game mechanics , narrative @-@ driven campaign , and online functionality . 
 The storyline is set within an alternate version of the Justice League 's universe . Superman establishes a new world order after the Joker tricks him into killing Lois Lane and destroying Metropolis . In an effort to stop this , Batman summons members of the Justice League from the mainstream continuity to join his insurgency and end the totalitarian regime . The game received positive reviews from critics , who praised its story , gameplay mechanics , and use of the DC Comics license . Injustice became the highest selling game in the United States and United Kingdom during the month of its release . The game also won several awards for " Best Fighting Game " in 2013 . A sequel titled Injustice 2 was announced in June 2016 , and is expected to be released in 2017 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Injustice : Gods Among Us is a fighting game in which players control characters with different fighting styles and special attacks , engaging in one @-@ on @-@ one combat to deplete their opponent 's life gauge . The game features 2.5D graphics ; movement is restricted to a two @-@ dimensional plane , while the characters and backgrounds are rendered in a three @-@ dimensional fashion . Unlike the traditional fighting game design involving multiple rounds with regenerative life bars , Injustice uses a scheme similar to the Killer Instinct series . Each match consists of a single round with each player bearing two life bars . The game utilizes a four @-@ button control layout of light , medium , and heavy attacks , alongside a " character trait " button , which activates a unique ability or attack designed to showcase each character . For instance , Superman 's character trait provides a temporary boost in strength , while Batman 's character trait summons a swarm of robotic bats . 
 The stages , based on various locations from the DC Universe , such as the Batcave , Metropolis , and Fortress of Solitude , feature interactive environments and multiple areas . If an opponent is hit with a heavy attack near a corner of the arena , it launches them , triggering a transition animation and taking the fight to a new section of the stage . Each section also contains objects that characters can interact with differently depending on their class . Characters fall into two classes : " power characters " , who rely on brute strength and innate abilities , and " gadget characters " , who use weapons , items , and other external mechanisms to win . For example , a gadget character like Batman can attach a bomb to a car to cause an explosion , while a power character like Superman will pick up the same car and smash his opponents with it . Players have the option to turn off interactive elements and stage transitions . 
 As characters perform special moves , block oncoming attacks , or get hit by the opponent , their " super meters " will gradually fill . Portions of the super meter can be used to execute enhanced special moves or counter enemy moves . With a full meter , players can unleash their strongest special attack . Players may also expend their meter to interrupt a combo and enter a wager battle , dubbed the " clash system " , which combines individualized cutscene cinematics with the process of betting meter . A clash may be triggered by a player only after they have lost their first life bar . During the sequence , both players commit portions of their meter in secret , with the highest bidder winning the clash . 
 The story mode is split into several chapters . As the narrative plays out , the player swaps between different characters . Minigames are also incorporated into the story . The outcome of minigames can impact an upcoming battle , such as giving the player a health advantage over the CPU opponent . Additional game features include Battle Mode , Versus Mode , Training Mode , and S.T.A.R. Labs , which includes 240 character @-@ specific challenges of varying difficulty . Online multiplayer modes include King of the Hill , a setup that allows up to eight players to spectate a match while waiting for their turn to fight , and Survivor , which carries over the current winner 's health bar and character selection over each match . Playing through any of the game modes , including online matches with optional goal objectives , will net the player experience points that may be used to unlock alternate costumes , music , concept art , and other rewards .

 The campaign of Injustice : Gods Among Us was written by NetherRealm Studios in collaboration with DC Comics ' writers . Described by NetherRealm as " Story Mode 3 @.@ 0 " , the campaign was approached similarly to Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe and the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot through the use of a cinematic narrative versus the traditional ladder @-@ based single @-@ player experience . According to lead designer John Edwards , the plot is meant to rationalize the game 's fighting mechanics between characters that would not normally fight one another and explain how Batman can " stand toe @-@ to @-@ toe " with Superman . Writers Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti served as story consultants to ensure that the comic characters kept their proper voices in Injustice .

A war ensues between the forces of Superman 's regime and Batman 's insurgency . 
 Five years into the war , the insurgency discovers another universe where the Joker 's plan did not succeed , and teleports Wonder Woman , Aquaman , Green Arrow , and Green Lantern into their world to help them defeat the regime . Batman and Joker are also inadvertently transported during the process , and the two are separated after an encounter with the alternate Superman 's regime .

Batman explains his plan to use a kryptonite @-@ based weapon stored in the Batcave against the High Councillor , but requires DNA samples from the other four heroes to unlock it . 
 Batman tracks the Joker to alternate Gotham , but is injured in a fight with him and nearly killed . The alternate Green Lantern and <unk> mistake Batman for theirs and apprehend him . The Joker then allies himself with the alternate reality 's Harley Quinn . Together with the Joker Clan , an underground organization founded by Quinn to honor her Joker , they fend off an attack by regime forces led by Nightwing ( Damian Wayne ) and <unk> . Joker and Harley Quinn are rescued by the <unk> , who later travel to the Batcave to recover the kryptonite weapon .

When Shazam protests this , Superman kills him , causing Flash to defect to the insurgency and inform them of Superman 's plans . 
 With the weapon rendered useless , the Justice League suggest recruiting their own version of Superman to stop the High Councillor . A large @-@ scale battle between the regime and insurgency erupts . The insurgency version of Batman is initially reluctant to bring another Superman into the alternate universe , but his alternate counterpart convinces him to do so . With the help of both versions of Batman , the Superman from the main timeline is successfully teleported into the alternate universe . After defeating the alternate versions of Black Adam , Sinestro , Hal Jordan , Aquaman , and a subservient Doomsday , Superman engages in a final confrontation against his evil counterpart , and emerges victorious , ending the reign of the High Councillor . 
 After Superman defeats the High Councillor , the Regime is dismantled and all of the High Councillor 's generals and accomplices are rounded up or have turned themselves in . Joker is returned to his reality . Green Lantern hands his counterpart and Sinestro over to the Guardians of the Universe to stand trial . Wonder Woman dethrones her counterpart . Cyborg visits the alternate Lex Luthor 's grave . While looking at his counterpart in his red sun radiation prison , rendering him powerless , Superman admits that had he been placed in the same position as his counterpart , he might have done the same thing . The alternate Batman tells him that if something ever happens , causing him to turn evil , he will hunt him down . As the two leave , the alternate Superman 's eyes glow red , indicating that he still has some degree of his powers .

 The roster was selected internally by NetherRealm Studios with input from DC Comics . The main goal during the selection process , which took around three to four months , was to create a cast featuring a wide variety of characters . Characters were chosen based on criteria such as size , ability , gender , popularity , and how well they fit within the Injustice storyline . The addition of each playable hero and villain required about six weeks of development . The characters were designed with the intent to make each fighter unique , and fighting styles and movesets were tailored to the lore and personality of each character . Ed Boon stated that DC Comics had given NetherRealm a large amount of freedom with their properties , allowing them to put their own spin on characters . Several other characters from the DC Universe , such as Darkseid , Scarecrow , <unk> , and Gorilla Grodd , also appear as non @-@ player characters , making cameo appearances in story cutscenes , stages , and other game modes . Outside of the DC universe , Scorpion from the Mortal Kombat series appears as a downloadable guest character .

 Injustice : Gods Among Us was first announced on May 31 , 2012 . According to Ed Boon , the main goal heading into Injustice was to create a game outside of the Mortal Kombat series that was dramatically different within the fighting game genre . Producer Hector Sanchez stated that NetherRealm Studios did not feel constrained by the parameters of Mortal Kombat , allowing the developers to take more design risks with Injustice , such as removing Mortal Kombat 's traditional dedicated block button . Similar to Boon 's previous DC @-@ related title , Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe , the use of the DC Comics license implied restrictions to the amount of violence in the game ; however , Boon intended to push the " Teen " rating by replacing violence with " crazy , over @-@ the @-@ top action . " When questioned if the studio 's past experience with Mortal Kombat and its characteristic violence would influence Injustice , Boon replied that he wanted to keep the two titles as separate entities . 
 The online mode in Injustice was built upon the foundation laid from Mortal Kombat . Due to complaints about severe lag in the online multiplayer portion of Mortal Kombat , Boon reported that the development team had looked back upon their past mistakes and created a " new , more elaborate system " for an improved online experience . Senior Producer Adam Urbano stated NetherRealm Studios spent two years of development focusing on <unk> . During development , NetherRealm shared their idea for an automated system to push Injustice downloadable content to all users ' consoles . The game would connect to the Internet during use and automatically download the information required for players who have bought DLC characters to play against others who have not . The system also allows NetherRealm to quickly send <unk> to patch noticeable glitches . 
 Like Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe and Mortal Kombat , Injustice runs on the Unreal Engine 3 , which was modified to suit fighting games . In the first Injustice development diary , NetherRealm Studios proclaimed that several technical advancements had been made since the release of Mortal Kombat in 2011 . Sanchez stated that their " <unk> team " had pushed the boundaries on their graphics engine . Urbano added that the game features a revamped lighting solution , enabling more dynamic lighting in terms of characters and environments . A new " character material " system was created to portray characters with increased graphical detail . Injustice also utilizes a multi @-@ threaded rendering engine , allowing the game to display approximately three times the amount of objects on screen at a single time than Mortal Kombat .

 The trestle was rebuilt in 1895 by the King Bridge Company to address public concerns regarding its stability , and it has been repeatedly reinforced throughout its existence . Concern over the sturdiness of the trestle has persisted since its opening , and was a major reason Conrail closed the Wallkill Valley rail line in 1977 . After the rail line 's closure , Conrail sold the bridge in 1986 for one dollar to a private businessman who tried unsuccessfully to operate the trestle as a bungee jumping platform in the 1990s . A similar attempt was made the following decade . The trestle was seized by the county in 2009 for tax nonpayment , and renovated as a pedestrian walkway for the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail . The deck and railings now continue all the way across the trestle , and access is from a parking lot about 1 ⁄ 4 mile ( 400 meters ) north on Binnewater Road . It opened to the public with a celebration on June 29 , 2013 .

 In 1870 , the Wallkill Valley Railroad operated trains between Montgomery and New Paltz , New York , and began building a 413 @-@ foot ( 126 m ) bridge south of Rosendale , at Springtown Road , to cross the Wallkill River . The Springtown bridge was completed by 1871 , and the rail line was opened north to the town of Rosendale . Rosendale issued $ 92 @,@ 800 in bonds on May 13 , 1869 to finance its portion of the railroad . 
 Though the trestle was difficult to build , and viewed as weak by modern standards , it was remarkable for its time , and can be considered the " most awesome part " of the Wallkill Valley rail line . Construction on the bridge 's abutments began in August 1870 by A. L. Dolby & Company , but work on the superstructure by the <unk> Manufacturing Company did not begin until the following year due to problems with quicksand during the excavation . Sections of the superstructure were built in Paterson , New Jersey . The bridge originally had seven wrought @-@ iron spans and two shorter wooden spans ; the longer spans were each 105 feet ( 32 m ) in length . The bridge cost $ 250 @,@ 000 to build , and followed a Post truss design . Roughly 1 @,@ 000 short tons ( 910 t ) of iron and 420 @,@ 000 board feet ( 990 m3 ) of timber went into its construction . At the time of its completion in January 1872 , it had the highest span of any bridge in the United States . Due to its height , it could " scarcely be crossed for the first time without something like a feeling of terror " . The bridge allowed the rail line to continue north to Kingston . 
 = = = Active rail service = = = 
 The bridge was opened on April 6 , 1872 in a ceremony attended by 5 @,@ 000 people , including prominent men from across Ulster , Orange , and Dutchess counties . One of the spectators was James S. McEntee , Esq . , an engineer who had worked on the Delaware and Hudson Canal in 1825 . He was the only person to have seen both " the passage of the first loaded boat through the canal and the first train over the bridge which spans it " . A 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 locomotive with five boxcars and two passenger cars made the inaugural run . Many spectators doubted the strength of the bridge , and believed that the trestle would collapse under the weight of the train . The bridge appeared unaffected by the strain , and an increasing number of people rode over the bridge during the second and third runs . 
 A. L. Dolby & Company was contracted to complete the rail line between the bridge and Kingston . The track reached the Kingston Union Station in November 1872 . By this time , trains were running regularly to and from Kingston . 
 By 1885 , the bridge supports were reinforced and the track was converted from broad gauge to standard gauge . In 1888 , the Wallkill Valley Railroad received a permit from the town of Rosendale to " construct and maintain abutments to support [ the ] trestle " as long as such work did not interfere with traffic along the underlying highway ( present @-@ day NY 213 ) . That same year , the Delaware and Hudson Canal allowed the railroad to temporarily use some of its property by the Rondout Creek to place bents for bridge repairs . The waterway beneath the trestle could be quite treacherous ; so many people drowned that the area became known as " Dead Man 's Stretch " . There have been reports of ghostly " apparitions " in the area , particularly of a white dog . 
 The bridge was rebuilt by the King Bridge Company between 1895 and 1896 , remaining in use most of the time ; the trestle is the only railroad bridge featured in the King Bridge Company catalogs of the 1880s and 1890s that remains standing . The renovation converted the bridge 's structure from iron and wood to steel to allay public concerns about its strength ; the height of the bridge evoked collapses such as the Tay Bridge disaster . The steel was provided by the Carnegie Steel Company . The renovation raised the bridge 's piers by 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) and made the bridge straighter ; the original design had a curve on the southern terminus . One of the northern spans was completed by February 1896 , and the entire reconstruction was finished by June . The layout of the spans was unchanged from the original 1872 design . Following its reconstruction , the bridge was unaffected by the shock of a large cave @-@ in at a nearby Rosendale cement quarry on December 26 , 1899 , though it was shaken by a nearby boiler explosion that occurred days before the collapse . 
 From the time of its reconstruction to its eventual closure , passengers continued to have concerns over the trestle . The " speed , weight , and positioning of rolling stock on the bridge " was monitored , and it was repeatedly reinforced to " carry the ever heavier loads of modern railroading " . In the 1940s , steam engines carrying heavy loads over the bridge caused the catwalk on the west side of the bridge to shake . By 1975 , the rail line had deteriorated to the point where federal regulations allowed only 8 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour ( 13 km / h ) traffic over the trestle , though engineers were instructed to only go as fast as 5 miles per hour ( 8 @.@ 0 km / h ) . The sturdiness of the bridge , specifically the stability of its piers , was a deciding factor when Conrail ( then @-@ owner of the Wallkill Valley rail line ) closed the Wallkill Valley Railroad in 1977 . 
 = = = Modern use = = = 
 Conrail had begun taking bids on the trestle as early as 1983 . An initial offer was made to the town of Rosendale , which refused , unwilling to accept the liability . Conrail sold the bridge , along with 11 @.@ 5 miles ( 18 @.@ 5 km ) of the Wallkill Valley rail corridor , in 1986 to a private businessman , John Rahl , for one dollar . Rahl took title of the trestle and corridor on July 11 , 1986 . Included in Rahl 's purchase was a train station in Rosendale 's hamlet of Binnewater ; the station was a part of the Binnewater Historic District . A Rosendale homeowner association had tried to purchase the properties before Rahl , also for one dollar , but Conrail declined their offer . 
 Rahl , born around 1948 in Washingtonville , was a construction worker and auto mechanic . He lived near the trestle , in a " converted warehouse , whose support beams had once formed the scaffolding for the trestle crews " . Rahl 's reason for buying the rail line was originally to open a " dining car restaurant " along the corridor , and to establish a tourist railroad from Kingston to the trestle . He claimed the purchase granted him the right to " restore rail service on the whole Wallkill line " , and joint ownership of Conrail . Plans to restore service subsequently " didn 't pan out " . Within one year of the purchase , Rahl sold 11 acres ( 4 @.@ 5 ha ) of the property to a housing developer . On May 16 , 1989 , a storm caused such severe damage to the Binnewater station that part of it broke off and fell into the road ; the building was subsequently demolished by the town of Rosendale 's highway department . 
 Between 1989 and 1991 , Rahl installed planking and guard rails on the southern half of the bridge , which was then opened to the public . He allowed bungee jumping off the bridge until a January 1992 court order held that it violated zoning laws . One person tried to bungee jump off the bridge without a restraining cord . The bridge was slightly damaged by a fire in mid @-@ 1999 , but it was repaired by September of that year . 
 Douglas Hase , an entrepreneur who had run bungee jumping and hot air ballooning companies , tried unsuccessfully in 2003 and 2004 to get a variance for another bungee jumping venture . During a public hearing about Hase 's proposal , a county legislator began screaming to simulate the sound neighbours would hear repetitively when people jumped off the bridge . 
 After Rahl failed to pay $ 13 @,@ 716 in property taxes over a period of three years , Ulster County foreclosed on the entire 63 @.@ 34 @-@ acre ( 25 @.@ 63 ha ) property on April 15 , 2009 . The Wallkill Valley Land Trust and Open Space Conservancy offered to purchase the property , and the county authorized the sale in July . The sale was completed in late August 2009 . The Land Trust agreed to pay all outstanding taxes before receiving full ownership and adding it to the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail . Ownership of the trestle was transferred to the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail Association . 
 Following an engineering survey by Bergmann Associates – the same firm that inspected the Poughkeepsie Bridge prior to its conversion to a walkway – the bridge was closed to the public in June 2010 for repairs . Renovations were originally expected to cost $ 750 @,@ 000 and begin in early 2011 , with a 12 @-@ month completion time . The New York State Office of Parks , Recreation and Historic Preservation granted $ 150 @,@ 000 toward the renovation . By November 2010 , an additional $ 300 @,@ 000 had been raised from private donors , and other sources . By the end of 2010 , over 10 1 ⁄ 2 short tons ( 9 @.@ 5 t ) of tires were removed from the Rosendale section of the rail trail . 
 The surface of the walkway was rebuilt with a wood @-@ plastic composite built by a volunteer force . On February 17 , 2011 , a Bergmann Associates employee used the trestle as a case study in a seminar on adaptive reuse of defunct railroad bridges . By late March 2011 , the estimated cost of renovating the trestle had risen to $ 1 @.@ 1 million , and the expected time to completion increased to two years . 
 A campaign to raise $ 500 @,@ 000 for the renovation began on March 27 , 2011 ; by June 30 , about $ 50 @,@ 000 had been raised . Two 2009 lawsuits brought by John E. Rahl against the New York Telephone Company over alleged fees due to him for a fiber optic line crossing the trestle were dismissed by two lower courts ( in Vermont and New York ) . On November 18 , 2011 , the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed Rahl 's appeal . As of July 2011 , a lawsuit brought by John Rahl over the ownership of the trestle remains pending before the Second Circuit Court . Rahl claimed that he retained ownership of the property because only the state , and not the county , had the right to seize the trestle , which was " forever railroad under 19th century eminent domain legal doctrines – long forgotten by modern jurisprudence " . The trestle has been the site of numerous picnics , barbecues , and at least one wedding . 
 In late June 2012 , contractors began welding new railings to the trestle and conducting other preparatory work for opening the walkway . An event at nearby Willow Kiln Park was held on June 29 , 2013 to celebrate the grand opening of the trestle to the public . The trestle was fully re @-@ opened to the public for the first time since the rail line closed , and a 24 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 39 km ) segment of the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail from Gardiner to Kingston was opened . 
 = Battle of Tulkarm = 
 The Battle of Tulkarm took place on 19 September 1918 , beginning of the Battle of Sharon , which along with the Battle of Nablus formed the set piece Battle of Megiddo fought between 19 and 25 September in the last months of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War . During the infantry phase of the Battle of Sharon the British Empire 60th Division , XXI Corps attacked and captured the section of the front line nearest the Mediterranean coast under cover of an intense artillery barrage including a creeping barrage and naval gunfire . This Egyptian Expeditionary Force ( EEF ) victory over the entrenched Ottoman Eighth Army , composed of German and Ottoman soldiers , began the Final Offensive , ultimately resulting in the destruction of the equivalent of one Ottoman army , the retreat of what remained of two others , and the capture of many thousands of prisoners and many miles of territory from the Judean Hills to the border of modern @-@ day Turkey . After the end of the battle of Megiddo , the Desert Mounted Corps pursued the retreating soldiers to Damascus , six days later . By the time an Armistice of Mudros was signed between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire five weeks later , Aleppo had been captured . 
 During the Battle of Tulkarm the 60th Division , ( XXI Corps ) advanced to cut the front line Ottoman trenches . They were supported as they moved forward by artillery fire , which lifted and crept forward while the infantry advanced to capture the Nahr el Faliq . Their advance forced the Ottoman Eighth Army to withdraw , and the continuing attack resulted in the capture of Tulkarm , and the Eighth Army headquarters . The tactic of the infantry attack covered by creeping artillery fire , was so successful that the front line was quickly cut and the way cleared for the British Empire cavalry divisions of Desert Mounted Corps to advance northwards up the Plain of Sharon . The cavalry aimed to capture the Ottoman lines of communication in the rear of the two German and Ottoman armies being attacked in the Judean Hills . By 20 September these cavalry divisions reached the rear , completely outflanked and almost encircled the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies during the Battle of Nazareth , Capture of Afulah and Beisan , Capture of Jenin and Battle of Samakh . Meanwhile , British Empire infantry divisions on the right of the 60th Division advanced to successfully attack the German and Ottoman trench lines along their front line at the Battles of Tabsor and Arara . The Ottoman Seventh Army headquarters at Nablus was subsequently attacked and captured during the Battle of Nablus . 
 = = Background = = 
 By July 1918 , it was clear that the German Spring Offensive on the Western Front , which had forced the postponement of offensive plans in Palestine , had failed , resulting in a return to trench warfare on the Western Front . This coincided with the approach of the campaigning season in the Middle East . 
 General Edmund Allenby , commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force ( EEF ) was " very anxious to make a move in September " when he expected to capture Tulkarm and Nablus , ( the headquarters of the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies ) , the road to Jisr ed Damieh and Es Salt . " Another reason for moving to this line is that it will encourage both my own new Indian troops and my Arab Allies . " 
 By September 1918 , the front line held by the EEF began virtually at sea level at a point on the Mediterranean coast about 12 miles ( 19 km ) north of Jaffa , just north of Arsuf , ran about 15 miles ( 24 km ) south @-@ east across the Plain of Sharon , then east over the Judean Hills for about 15 miles ( 24 km ) rising to a height of 1 @,@ 500 – 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 460 – 610 m ) above sea level . From the Judean Hills the front line fell steeply to 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) below sea @-@ level in the Jordan Valley , where it continued for about 18 miles ( 29 km ) to the Dead Sea and the foothills of the Mountains of Gilead / Moab . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 = = = British plans and preparations = = = 
 On the first quarter of the front line which stretched 15 miles ( 24 km ) across the Plain of Sharon from the Mediterranean Sea , the XXI Corps 35 @,@ 000 infantry , Desert Mounted Corps ' 9 @,@ 000 cavalry and 383 artillery pieces were preparing for the attack . On the remaining three quarters of the front line stretching to the Dead Sea , 22 @,@ 000 infantry , 3 @,@ 000 mounted troops and 157 artillery pieces of the XX Corps and Chaytor 's Force were deployed facing the Seventh and Fourth Ottoman Armies . 
 " Concentration , surprise , and speed were key elements in the blitzkrieg warfare planned by Allenby . " The Battle of Sharon was to begin with an attack on the 8 miles ( 13 km ) long front line , between the branch of the Jaffa @-@ Jerusalem railway running north from Lydda towards Tulkarm ( cut at the front line ) and the Mediterranean , where Allenby massed three mounted divisions behind three of the XXI Corps ' infantry divisions , supported by 18 densely deployed , heavy and siege batteries . Together , the five infantry divisions of the XXI Corps , commanded by Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin , had a 4 @.@ 4 – to – 1 advantage in total troop numbers and three times the defenders ' heavy artillery . 
 The objective of the 60th Division , ( XXI Corps ) , which consisted of three British Indian Army infantry battalions for each British battalion , was to attack in " overwhelming strength at the selected point " , supported by the " greatest possible weight of artillery " , to cut the German and Ottoman front line and create a gap sufficiently wide for the " great mass " of mounted troops to break through , passing quickly , " unimpaired by serious fighting " , to the rear of the Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills . 
 After the cavalry breakthrough on the coast , the XXI Corps would advance to capture the headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army at Tulkarm together with sections of the lateral railway line in the Judean Hills between Tulkarm and Nablus , a branch of the Jezreel Valley railway , which supplied the two Ottoman Armies , including the important railway junction at Messudieh in the Judean Hills . The infantry divisions were to continue their attack by swinging north – east , pivoting on their right to push the defenders back out of their trenches away from the coast and back into the Judean Hills towards Messudieh . 
 The XXI Corps ' 60th Division would advance north @-@ east towards Tulkarm , while on their right the 3rd ( Lahore ) , the 7th ( Meerut ) and the 75th Divisions , each division consisting of one British infantry and three British Indian Army infantry battalion per brigade , would attack the Tabsor defences , while the all British 54th ( East Anglian ) Division and the French Détachement Français de Palestine et de Syrie ( <unk> ) defended and pivoted on the Rafat salient . Further to the right , the XX Corps would begin the Battle of Nablus in the Judean Hills in support of the main attack by the XXI Corps , by advancing to capture the Seventh Army headquarters at Nablus and blocking the main escape route from the Judean Hills to the Jisr ed Damieh . 
 Together , these attacks would force the enemy to retreat down the main line of communication along the road and branch line of the Jezreel Valley railway , which ran alongside each other to pass through Jenin , and across the Esdrealon Plain 50 miles ( 80 km ) away , and on to Damascus . The plain was also the site of the important communication hubs at Afulah and Beisan and here thousands would be captured by the cavalry of Desert Mounted Corps as they advanced to their objectives of Afulah ( 4th Cavalry Division ) , the Yildirim Army Group 's headquarters at Nazareth ( 5th Cavalry Division ) and Jenin ( Australian Mounted Division ) on the Esdraelon Plain . 
 The successful exploitation of the infantry attack on the coast by Desert Mounted Corps ' cavalry 's breakthrough depended on the mounted corps occupying the Esdraelon Plain ( also known as the Jezreel Valley and the ancient Plain of Armageddon ) , 40 miles ( 64 km ) behind the Ottoman front line . The site of important Ottoman communications hubs at Afulah and Beisan , the Esdraelon Plain links the Plain of Sharon with the Jordan Valley . Together , these three lowlands form a semicircle round the positions held by the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills . If the Esdraelon Plain could be captured swiftly , the entire Ottoman army west of the Jordan could be captured .

 The 60th Division commanded by Major General J. S. M. Shea , was to fight on the ancient battlefield between Arsuf and the Nahr el Faliq , where in 1191 King Richard defeated Saladin and avenged Hattin . Shea 's infantry division was to advance to establish a bridgehead across the Nahr el Faliq and create a gap in the front line for the cavalry . Then the 60th Division was to advance north @-@ east to capture Tulkarm and cut the railway line east of it . 
 By the evening of 18 September , the 60th Division was deployed with the 180th Brigade in the lead and the 181st Brigade some 16 miles ( 26 km ) from Tulkarm , with the 179th Brigade in reserve . The recently formed 5th Light Horse Brigade was attached to the 60th Division , although it was positioned for its initial advance directly towards Tulkarm , behind the 7th ( Meerut ) Division . Also attached to the 60th Division were the 13th Pontoon Park , which would build a pontoon crossing of the Nahr el Faliq ; the 102nd Brigade Royal Garrison Artillery ; and the 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery , who were to join the division at Tulkarm .

 In August 1918 , the Central Powers ' Yildirim Army Group commanded by Otto Liman von Sanders consisted of 40 @,@ 598 frontline infantrymen organised into twelve divisions defending a 56 miles ( 90 km ) long front . They were armed with 19 @,@ 819 rifles , 273 light and 696 heavy machine guns . The high number of machine guns reflects the Ottoman Army 's new tables of organization and the high machine gun component of the German Asia Korps . Another estimate of this fighting strength was 26 @,@ 000 infantry , 2 @,@ 000 mounted troops and 372 guns . Yet another estimate is that on a 15 miles ( 24 km ) front extending from the Mediterranean coast westwards , the German and Ottoman force may have deployed 8 @,@ 000 infantry supported by 130 guns , with the remaining 45 miles ( 72 km ) of front defended by 24 @,@ 000 German and Ottoman soldiers and 270 guns . 
 Cevat Pasha 's Eighth Army of 10 @,@ 000 soldiers supported by 157 guns , with its headquarters at Tulkarm , held a line from the Mediterranean coast just north of Arsuf to Furkhah in the Judean Hills . This army was organised into the XXII Corps ( 7th , 20th and 46th Divisions ) and the " Asia Corps " , also known as the " Left Wing Group " , commanded by the German Colonel Gustav von Oppen ( 16th and 19th Divisions , three German battalion groups of the German " Pasha II " detachment ) , with the 2nd Caucasian Cavalry Division in reserve . The Asia Corps linked the Eighth Army 's XXII Corps on the coast with the Seventh Army 's III Corps further inland , facing units of the British XX Corps . ( See the Battle of Nablus for a description of this fighting . ) 
 The 7th , 19th and 20th Divisions held the shortest frontage in the entire Yildirim Army Group . The 7th and 20th Divisions , together held a total of 7 @.@ 5 miles ( 12 @.@ 1 km ) of trenches ; the 7th Division held 4 @.@ 3 miles ( 6 @.@ 9 km ) nearest the coast while the 20th Division held 3 @.@ 1 miles ( 5 @.@ 0 km ) and the Asia Corps ' 19th Division held 6 @.@ 2 miles ( 10 @.@ 0 km ) of trenches further inland , with the 46th Division in reserve 7 @.@ 5 miles ( 12 @.@ 1 km ) from the front line , near the Eighth Army 's headquarters at Tulkarm . 
 These divisions were some of the most highly regarded fighting formations in the Ottoman Army ; in 1915 the 7th and 19th Divisions had fought as part of Esat Pasa 's III Corps at Gallipoli . The 20th Division had also fought towards the end of the Gallipoli campaign and served for a year in Galicia fighting against Russians on the eastern front . This regular army division , which had been raised and stationed in Palestine , was sometimes referred to as the Arab Division . 
 The XXII Corps was supported by the majority of the Yildirim Army 's heavy artillery for counter battery operations . Here , three of the five Ottoman Army heavy artillery batteries in Palestine ( the 72nd , 73rd and 75th Batteries ) were deployed . Further , the Ottoman front line regiments had been alerted that a major attack was imminent . 
 On 17 September 1918 , Ottoman Army intelligence accurately placed five infantry divisions and a detachment opposite their Eighth Army . As a consequence , the 46th Infantry Division was moved up 8 @.@ 1 miles ( 13 @.@ 0 km ) to the south – west to a new reserve position at Et Tire , directly behind the Ottoman XXII Corps 's front line divisions . 
 Claims have been made that the Ottoman armies were understrength , overstretched , suffering greatly from a strained supply system and overwhelmingly outnumbered by the EEF by about two to one , and " haemorrhaging " deserters . It is claimed , without taking into account the large number of machine guns , the effective strengths of the nine infantry battalions of the 16th Infantry Division each was equal to a British infantry company of between 100 and 250 men while 150 to 200 men were assigned to the 19th Infantry Division battalions which had had 500 – 600 men at Beersheba . It is also claimed that problems with the supply system in February 1918 resulted in the normal daily ration in Palestine being 125 grains ( 0 @.@ 29 oz ) of bread and boiled beans in the morning , at noon , and at night , without oil or any other condiment . 
 = = = = Tabsor defences = = = = 
 The Tabsor defences consisted of the only continuous trench and redoubt system on the front line . Here the Ottomans had dug two or three lines of trenches and redoubts , varying in depth from 1 – 3 miles ( 1 @.@ 6 – 4 @.@ 8 km ) . These defences , centred on the Tabsor village , stretched from Jaljulye to the coast . Another less developed system of defences was 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) behind , and the beginnings of a third system ran from Tulkarm across the Plain of Sharon to the Nahr Iskanderun . 
 It has been suggested that an inflexible defence relying on a line of trenches had been developed by the Ottoman armies , which required every inch of ground ... to be fought for , when a more flexible system would have better suited the situation .

 = = = Bombardment = = = 
 " The infantry will advance to the assault under an artillery barrage which will be put down at the hour at which the infantry leave their positions of deployment . This hour will be known as the ' XXI Corps Zero Hour . ' There will be no preliminary bombardment . " 
 Just as the preliminary attack by the 53rd Division , XX Corps on the Judean Hills front ( see Battle of Nablus ) was pausing , at 04 : 30 a bombardment by artillery , trench mortars and machine guns began firing at the German and Ottoman front and second lines of trenches in front of XXI Corps . Three siege batteries fired on opposing batteries while the destroyers HMS Druid and HMS Forester opened fire on the trenches north of the Nahr el Faliq . 
 This intense bombardment , which closely resembled a Western Front bombardment , continued for half an hour , with guns deployed one to every 50 yards ( 46 m ) of front . The artillery was organised by weight and targets : heavy artillery was aimed at counter @-@ batteries , with some guns and 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch howitzers shelling targets beyond the range of the field artillery 's barrage and any places the infantry advance was held up . Meanwhile , the field artillery bombarded the Ottoman front line until the infantry advance arrived , then the 18 – pounders and Royal Horse Artillery batteries lifted to form a creeping barrage in front of the infantry up to their extreme range . This barrage began firing at a range of 4 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) but by 08 : 00 it had been extended to 15 @,@ 000 yards ( 14 @,@ 000 m ) as the guns elevated and their firing range extended at a rate of between 50 to 75 yards ( 46 to 69 m ) , and 100 yards ( 91 m ) per minute . There was no systematic attempt by the artillery to cut the wire ; the leading units were to cut it by hand or carry some way of crossing or bridging it .

 While the 60th Division 's attack on the coast was proceeding , the 75th Division on their right attacked the Tabsor defences , fighting its way towards Et Tire which they captured . On the right of the 75th Division , the 7th ( Meerut ) Division advanced north @-@ eastwards towards the north of Et Tire to attack the defences west of Tabsor , while the 3rd ( Lahore ) Division , on the right of the 7th ( Meerut ) Division , advanced rapidly and seized the first line defences between Bir Adas and the Hadrah road . This division then turned eastwards to make a flank attack on the defences at Jiljulieh and Kalkilieh in the Judean foothills . Meanwhile , the 54th ( East Anglian ) Division on the right of the 3rd ( Lahore ) Division with the French detachment on its left , achieved their objective of establishing and acting as a firm pivot for the rest of the British infantry line , although they experienced strong resistance from Asia Corps .

 Twelve minutes after the artillery bombardment began , the 180th Brigade 's three Indian infantry battalions attacked in two columns . The right column , led by the 50th Kumaon Rifles , captured Birket <unk> and 110 prisoners along with eight machine guns . Then , advancing at a rate of 75 yards ( 69 m ) a minute behind the artillery barrage , at 05 : 50 they captured redoubts and two succeeding lines of trenches , along with 125 prisoners and seven machine guns . Shortly afterwards , a further 69 prisoners were captured west of Birket Ramadan . The 2 / 97th Deccan Infantry following the Kumaon Rifles captured a redoubt , 40 prisoners and four machine guns . 
 Meanwhile , the left column consisting of the 2nd Guides was caught by an Ottoman artillery barrage which caused 54 casualties before the leading companies reached the intact Ottoman wire , which was crossed . By 05 : 40 all three Ottoman trench lines were captured , with more than 100 prisoners . 
 The bridge across the Nahr el Faliq which carried the coast road was strongly defended , and it was not until 07 : 20 that the 180th Brigade 's 2 / 97th Infantry from the right column was able to capture it , and a company established a bridgehead on the northern side of the mouth of the Nahr el Faliq 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) behind the Ottoman front line , providing the cavalry with safe passage northwards . The 180th Brigade had captured the front line defences and about 600 prisoners , while advancing 6 @,@ 000 – 7 @,@ 000 yards ( 5 @,@ 500 – 6 @,@ 400 m ) north of their starting point , suffering 414 casualties . All wire entanglements on the beach were removed by the reserve battalion , the 2 / 30th Punjabis , so the 5th Cavalry Division could pass through a few minutes later .

 Having captured the Nahr el Faliq and after providing the cavalry with the required breakthrough to advance northwards , the 60th Division then turned north @-@ east towards Tulkarm , with the 5th Light Horse Brigade on its right flank . 
 At 06 : 15 the 181st Brigade was ordered to advance to the north . The 181st had one machine gun section attached to each battalion , and the 2 / 97th Deccan Infantry in reserve . ( Prior to this order to advance , the machine gun sections had formed part of the artillery barrage . ) By 08 : 30 the leading troops of the brigade column had crossed the Nahr el Faliq and the causeway at Kh. ez <unk> . 
 Then turning eastwards , their first objectives were to capture Ayun el <unk> and advance on Umm Sur 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) further north . Both of these were captured by 11 : 00 , by the 130th <unk> and the 2 / 22nd Battalion , London Regiment , both of the 181st Brigade . Their next objective , prior to advancing on Tulkarm , was to take the Qalqilye to Tulkarm road . The battalions were supported by two 18 pounder batteries of the 301st Brigade Royal Field Artillery . 
 = = = Ottoman defenders in the coastal sector = = = 
 By 05 : 45 telephone communication to the Ottoman front had been cut and five minutes later all German and Ottoman reserves had been ordered forward . 
 At 08 : 50 , the Eighth Army 's commander , Cevat reported to Liman von Sanders at the Yildirim Army Group headquarters at Nazareth , that the Ottoman 7th Division ( XXII Corps , Eighth Army ) was " out of the fight " and the 19th Division was under attack . Liman ordered the 110th Infantry Regiment to advance to support the Eighth Army . Meanwhile , a rearguard formed by 100 soldiers from the 7th Division armed with two machine guns and 17 artillery guns , and 300 soldiers from the 20th Division armed with four machine guns and seven artillery guns , made a desperate attempt to hold back the British Empire attack . The rearguards established by the 7th and 20th Divisions continued to fight while retiring , the 7th Division establishing divisional headquarters at Mesudiye . 
 Eventually , the 19th Division was forced to retreat towards <unk> Kasim , while the XXII Corps was in retreat towards Et Tire , having lost most of its artillery . The enemy has broken through our lines in spite of our counter – attacks ... Without assistance operations are impossible . 
 By 12 : 00 Cevat was aware that British Empire infantry was advancing on his headquarters at Tulkarm , and by 16 : 30 that Et Tire had been captured . By dusk he had begun to move his headquarters north , having been finally and completely cut off from news and reports from his XXII Corps .

 As the 181st Brigade approached Tulkarm from the south @-@ west , a number of aircraft bombed the town . The combined effects of the aerial attack and the approaching infantry resulted in many occupants leaving Tulkarm , and traveling along the road to Nablus . At 17 : 00 the 181st Brigade 's 2 / 22nd Battalion , London Regiment with the 2 / 152nd Infantry on the right captured Tulkarm railway station and the town , while the 2 / 127th Baluch Light Infantry were held up at <unk> . At Tulkarm 800 prisoners and 12 field guns were captured . 
 The 5th Light Horse Brigade commanded by Brigadier General Macarthur Onslow with the 2nd New Zealand Machine Gun Squadron attached , had been instructed by the commander of the 60th Division to bypass Tulkarm if it was strongly defended , and cut the main road to Nablus from Tulkarm . This Australian and French cavalry brigade moved to the left , to clear the infantry battle and enemy machine gun fire opposing the 181st Brigade , and rode north of Tulkarm to eventually take up a position controlling the road to Nablus . 
 About 21 : 00 a lieutenant , 23 troopers and two machine guns of the 5th Light Horse Brigade , guarding the road to Nablus , saw a long column approaching from the south . The light horsemen opened fire and stopped the column in the narrowest part of the road . After a brief discussion , between 2 @,@ 000 and 2 @,@ 800 Ottoman troops with between four and 15 guns surrendered to the Régiment Mixte de Marche de Cavalerie , 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) north of the town .

 By the end of the day , the 60th Division had captured all its objectives , including the town of Tulkarm , which had been the site of the Eighth Army 's headquarters , after a hard march of 17 miles ( 27 km ) from their starting line . By this time the Eighth Army commander was a fugitive , his army was in disarray , and his right flank was exposed , while the headquarters of the Desert Mounted Corps was bivouaced near Liktera many miles north , after successfully riding through the gap created by the infantry up the Plain of Sharon . 
 At 20 : 45 in the evening of 19 September , General Bulfin , commander of the XXI Corps , issued orders for the continuation of the advance . The objectives for the 60th Division on 20 September were to take up " a position facing generally north on the north side of the Tul Karm to Deir Sheraf road with their right on Jebel Bir ' Asur north east of ' Anebta and left at <unk> north of Tul Karm . " 
 The 60th Division 's 179th Brigade moved from Tulkarm towards ' Anebta , with the objective of capturing the railway tunnel near Jebel Bir Asur 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) to the north @-@ east . The 3 / 151st Punjab Rifles , with a squadron from the Composite Regiment , Corps Cavalry , a section of machine guns , and two 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch howitzers formed the advance guard , which quickly pushed small rearguards from ridges . The Punjab Rifles entered ' Anebta at 11 : 20 having captured 66 prisoners , and occupied the intact tunnel shortly after , while the 181st Brigade took up a defensive line north of the Tulkarm to ' Anebta road from the right of the 179th Brigade to the village of <unk> . 
 Meanwhile , at 02 : 00 on 20 September , the 5th Light Horse Brigade , less one squadron guarding prisoners , advanced from Tulkarm towards ' <unk> to cut the railway from Messudieh to Jenin . Two squadrons reached the railway 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of ' <unk> where they blew up the line . The brigade was then ordered to move north to Jenin , but instead the brigade concentrated back at Tulkarm at 19 : 00 , having captured 140 prisoners and two machine guns . 
 During the 19 September , the XXI Corps had destroyed the right wing of the Ottoman front line , capturing 7 @,@ 000 prisoners and 100 guns . Remnants of the Eighth Army which had escaped were captured the next day by Desert Mounted Corps at Jenin , in the Esdrealon Plain to the north of the Judean Hills . On 19 and 20 September the XXI Corps suffered total of 3 @,@ 378 casualties of whom 446 were killed . They had captured 12 @,@ 000 prisoners , 149 guns and vast quantities of ammunition and transport . With the exception of the Asia Corps , the whole Eighth Army had been destroyed . 
 = Somerset Levels = 
 The Somerset Levels are a coastal plain and wetland area of Somerset , South West England , running south from the Mendips to the Blackdown Hills . 
 The Somerset Levels have an area of about 160 @,@ 000 acres ( 650 km2 ) and are bisected by the Polden Hills ; the areas to the south are drained by the River Parrett , and the areas to the North by the rivers Axe and Brue . The Mendip Hills separate the Somerset Levels from the North Somerset Levels . The Somerset Levels consist of marine clay " levels " along the coast and inland peat @-@ based " moors " ; agriculturally , about 70 per cent is used as grassland and the rest is arable . Willow and <unk> are grown commercially and peat is extracted . 
 A Palaeolithic flint tool found in West Sedgemoor is the earliest indication of human presence in the area . The Neolithic people exploited the reed swamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways , including the world 's oldest known timber trackway , the Post Track , dating from the 3800s BC . The Levels were the location of the Glastonbury Lake Village as well as two Lake villages at Meare Lake . Several settlements and hill forts were built on the natural " islands " of slightly raised land , including Brent Knoll and Glastonbury . In the Roman period sea salt was extracted and a string of settlements were set up along the Polden Hills . The discovery at Shapwick of 9 @,@ 238 silver Roman coins , known as the Shapwick Hoard , was the second largest ever found from the time of the Roman Empire . A number of Saxon charters document the incorporation of areas of moor in estates . In 1685 , the Battle of Sedgemoor was fought in the <unk> area of Westonzoyland at the conclusion of the Monmouth Rebellion . 
 As a result of the wetland nature of the Levels , the area contains a rich biodiversity of national and international importance . It supports a vast variety of plant and bird species and is an important feeding ground for birds and includes 32 Sites of Special Scientific Interest , of which 12 are also Special Protection Areas . The area has been extensively studied for its biodiversity and heritage , and has a growing tourism industry . 
 People have been draining the area since before the Domesday Book . In the Middle Ages , the monasteries of Glastonbury , Athelney and Muchelney were responsible for much of the drainage . The artificial Huntspill River was constructed during the Second World War as a reservoir , although it also serves as a drainage channel . The Sowy River between the River Parrett and King 's Sedgemoor Drain was completed in 1972 ; water levels are managed by the Levels internal drainage boards . During 2009 and 2010 proposals to build a series of electricity pylons by one of two routes between Hinkley Point and Avonmouth , to transmit electricity from the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station , attracted local opposition . Discussions have taken place concerning the possibility of obtaining World Heritage Site status for the Somerset Levels as a " cultural landscape " . It was suggested that if this bid were successful it could improve flood control , but only if wetland fens were created again ; the plans were abandoned in 2010 . 
 = = Natural region = = 
 The Somerset Levels form a natural region that has been designated as a national character area – No. 142 – by Natural England , the public body responsible for England 's natural environment . Neighbouring natural regions are : the Vale of Taunton and Quantock Fringes to the west , the Blackdowns to the southwest , the Mid Somerset Hills and Yeovil Scarplands to the southeast , the Mendip Hills to the east and the Bristol , Avon Valleys and Ridges to the northeast . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The Levels are mainly flat areas of inland plains and a coastal sand and clay barrier , east and west of the M5 motorway . There are some slightly raised parts , called " burtles " , as well as higher ridges and hills . The Levels are about 20 feet ( 6 m ) above mean sea level ( O.D. ) . The general elevation inland is 10 to 12 feet ( 3 to 4 m ) O.D. with peak tides of 25 to 26 feet ( 8 to 8 m ) O.D. recorded at Bridgwater and Burnham @-@ on @-@ Sea . Large areas of peat were laid down in the Brue Valley during the Quaternary period after the ice sheets melted . The area 's topography consists of two basins mainly surrounded by hills , the runoff from which forms rivers that originally meandered across the plain but have now been controlled by embanking and <unk> ( the local name for a sluice ) . The area is prone to winter floods of fresh water and occasional salt water inundations . The worst in recorded history was the Bristol Channel floods of 1607 , which resulted in the drowning of an estimated 2 @,@ 000 or more people , houses and villages swept away , an estimated 200 square miles ( 518 km2 ) of farmland inundated , and livestock killed . Another severe flood occurred in 1872 – 1873 , when over 107 square miles ( 277 km2 ) were underwater from October to March . 
 Although underlain by much older Triassic age formations that protrude to form what would once have been islands — such as Athelney , Brent Knoll , Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor — the lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10 @,@ 000 years , following the end of the last ice age . Glastonbury Tor is composed of Upper Lias Sand . The Poldens and the Isle of Wedmore are composed of Blue Lias and Marl , while the Mendips are largely Carboniferous limestone . Although sea level changes since the Pliocene led to changes in sea level and the laying down of vegetation , the peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6 @,@ 000 years ago , although in some areas it continued into medieval times . 
 It is a mainly agricultural region , typically with open fields of permanent grass surrounded by ditches with willow trees . Access to individual areas , especially for cattle , was provided by means of " droves " , i.e. green lanes , leading off the public highways . Some of the old roads , in contrast to the old hollow ways found in other areas of England , are causeways raised above the level of the surrounding land , with a drainage ditch running along each side . 
 = = = Settlements = = = 
 Most of the settlements on the Levels are small villages . In the south , Aller , which has a population of 374 , includes the hamlet of Beer ( sometimes Bere ) and the deserted medieval village of Oath on the opposite bank of the River Parrett . The area known as the Isle of Athelney was once a very low isolated island linked by a causeway to East Lyng , each end of which was protected by a semi @-@ circular stockade and ditch . The ditch on the island is now known to date from the Iron Age , and was used by Alfred the Great as a fort before the Battle of Ethandun in May 878 ; in gratitude for his victory Alfred founded a monastery , Athelney Abbey , on the Isle in 888 , which survived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII in 1539 . <unk> is a small village which has a population of 498 . Brent Knoll is a large village at the foot of 449 @-@ foot ( 137 m ) Brent Knoll Camp that dominates the surrounding landscape ; the name means Beacon Hill in Old English . Brent Knoll has been inhabited since at least the Bronze Age . Before the Somerset Levels were drained , Brent Knoll was an island known as the Isle ( or Mount ) of Frogs . 
 Glastonbury ( population 8 @,@ 784 ) and Street ( 11 @,@ 066 ) lie on opposite sides of the River Brue , and provide a central point for trade and commerce . Larger centres are generally on slightly higher ground around the edges of the Levels . Bridgwater is a market town , the administrative centre of the Sedgemoor district , and a major industrial centre . With a population of 33 @,@ 698 , it straddles the major communication routes through South West England . Situated on the edge of the Somerset Levels , along both banks of the River Parrett and 10 miles ( 16 km ) from its mouth , it was at one time a major port and trading centre . The hamlet of Dunball forms part of the port on the river . Burrowbridge lies on the River Parrett further inland . The name probably comes from the Old English <unk> ( fortified hill ) and brycg ( bridge ) . In the village is Burrow Mump , an ancient earthwork now owned by the National Trust . Burrow Mump is also known as St Michael 's Borough or <unk> . It is a natural hill of Triassic sandstone capped by Keuper marl . Excavations showed evidence of a medieval masonry building on the top of the hill . 
 Along the coast , settlements such as Berrow are built on the line of sand dunes separating the low @-@ lying marshes from the Bristol Channel . At the northern end Bleadon lies on the River Axe ; and there was for many years a small harbour , sometimes known as Lympsham Wharf . The arrival of the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1841 , which crossed the Axe on a bridge , obstructed river traffic beyond the wharf , making it the limit of navigation for coastal vessels . An Act of 1915 authorised the drainage of the river and installation of a flood gate at Bleadon , although attempts to control the water had occurred on Bleadon Level since medieval times , including an early windmill , in 1613 , to pump water into the sea from behind a sea wall . Burnham @-@ on @-@ Sea ( population 18 @,@ 401 ) is at the mouth of the River Parrett where it enters Bridgwater Bay . The position of the town on the edge of the Somerset Levels has resulted in a history dominated by land reclamation and sea defences since Roman times . Burnham was seriously affected by the Bristol Channel floods of 1607 , and various flood defences have been installed since then . A concrete sea wall was built in 1911 , and after the Second World War further additions to the defences were made , using the remains of a Mulberry harbour ; the present curved concrete wall was completed in 1988 . Highbridge , which neighbours Burnham , is near the mouth of the River Brue and the villages of East and West Huntspill . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Along with the rest of South West England the Somerset Levels have a temperate climate , which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country . The annual mean temperature is approximately 10 ° C ( 50 @.@ 0 ° F ) . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea . The summer months of July and August are the warmest , with mean daily maxima of approximately 21 ° C ( 69 @.@ 8 ° F ) . In winter , mean minimum temperatures of 1 or 2 ° C ( 33 @.@ 8 or 35 @.@ 6 ° F ) are common . The Azores high pressure area influences the south @-@ west of England 's summer weather , but convective cloud sometimes forms inland , reducing the number of hours of sunshine . Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1 @,@ 600 hours . In December 1998 , there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton . Most rainfall in the south @-@ west is caused by convection or Atlantic depressions , which are most active in autumn and winter , when they are the chief cause of rain . In summer , a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by the Sun heating the land , leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms . Average rainfall is around 700 mm ( 28 in ) , and about 8 – 15 days of snowfall is typical . November to March have the highest mean wind speeds , and June to August have the lightest winds . The predominant wind direction is from the southwest . It was devastated by the UK storms of January – February 2014 . 
 = = Water management = = 
 The Moors and Levels , formed from a submerged and reclaimed landscape , consist of a coastal clay belt only slightly above mean sea level , with an inland peat belt at a lower level behind it . 
 Early attempts to control the water levels were possibly made by the Romans ( although records only date from the 13th century ) , but were not widespread . 
 There was a port at Bleadney on the River Axe in the 8th century which allowed goods to be brought to within 3 miles ( 5 km ) of Wells . In 1200 , a wharf was constructed at Rackley near Axbridge . The Parrett was navigable up as far as Langport in 1600 , with 15 to 20 ton barges . The Domesday Book recorded that drainage of the higher grounds was under way , although the moors at <unk> were said to be useless . 
 In the Middle Ages , the monasteries of Glastonbury , Athelney , and Muchelney were responsible for much of the drainage . In 1129 , the Abbot of Glastonbury was recorded as inspecting enclosed land at Lympsham . Efforts to control flooding on the Parrett were recorded around the same date . In 1234 , 722 acres ( 2 @.@ 9 km2 ) were reclaimed near Westonzoyland and , from the accounts in the abbey 's rent books , this had increased to 972 acres ( 393 ha ) by 1240 . 
 = = = Drains = = = 
 Flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed during the 13th century by the construction of a number of embankment walls to contain the Parrett . They included Southlake Wall , Burrow Wall , and Lake Wall . The River Tone was also diverted by the Abbot of Athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel , joining the Parrett upstream from its original confluence . 
 The main drainage outlets flowing through the Moors and Levels are the rivers Axe , Brue , Huntspill , Parrett , Tone , and Yeo , together with the King 's Sedgemoor Drain , an artificial channel into which the River Cary now runs . Previously , the Cary ran into the Tone while the Brue ran through Meare Pool ( now drained ) and the Panborough Gap , and then into the Axe . Another accomplishment in the Middle Ages was the construction of the tidal <unk> Cut , joining the Brue and Axe . 
 In 1500 , there was said to be 70 @,@ 000 acres ( 283 km2 ) of floodable land of which only 20 @,@ 000 acres ( 81 km2 ) had been reclaimed . In 1597 , 50 acres ( 20 ha ) of land were recovered near the Parrett estuary ; a few years later , 140 acres ( 57 ha ) near Pawlett were recovered by means of embankments ; and three further reclamations , totalling 110 acres ( 45 ha ) , had been undertaken downstream of Bridgwater by 1660 . 
 In the early 17th century , during the time of King James I , abortive plans were made to drain and enclose much of Sedgemoor , which the local Lords supported but opposed by the Commoners who would have lost grazing rights . In 1632 , Charles I sold the Crown 's interest in the scheme , and it was taken over by a consortium that included Sir Cornelius Vermuyden , a Dutch drainage engineer . However , the work was delayed by the English Civil War and later defeated in parliament after local opposition . In 1638 , it was reported that nearly 2 @,@ 600 acres ( 11 km2 ) of Tealham and Tadham Moors were not reclaimed , with a total of 30 @,@ 500 acres ( 123 @.@ 43 km2 ) being <unk> . Between 1785 and 1791 , much of the lowest part of the peat moors was enclosed . In 1795 , John Billingsley advocated enclosure and the digging of rhynes ( a local name for drainage channels , pronounced " reens " in the east and rhyne to the west ) between plots , and wrote in his Agriculture of the County of Somerset that 4 @,@ 400 acres ( 18 km2 ) had been enclosed in the last 20 years in Wedmore and Meare , 350 acres ( 1 @.@ 4 km2 ) at Nyland , 900 acres ( 3 @.@ 64 km2 ) at Blackford , 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 8 km2 ) at Mark , 100 acres ( 0 @.@ 4 km2 ) in Shapwick , and 1 @,@ 700 acres ( 7 km2 ) at Westhay . 
 At Westhay Moor in the early 19th century , it was shown how peat bogs could be successfully drained and top @-@ dressed with silt deposited via flooding , creating a very rich soil . The character of the soil was also changed by the spreading of clay and silt from the digging of King 's Sedgemoor Drain . 
 = = = Pumps = = = 
 Little attempt was made during the 17th and 18th centuries to pump water , possibly because the coal @-@ driven Newcomen steam engines would have been uneconomical . It is unclear why windmills were not employed , as they were on the Fens of East Anglia , but only two examples have been recorded on the Levels : one at Bleadon at the mouth of the River Axe , where a sea wall had been built , and the other at Common Moor north of Glastonbury , which was being drained following a private Act of Parliament in 1721 . The first steam pumping station was Westonzoyland Pumping Station in 1830 , followed by more effective ones from 1860 . Automatic electric pumps are used today . 
 The man @-@ made Huntspill River was constructed during World War II with sluices at both ends to provide a guaranteed daily supply of 4 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 imperial gallons ( 20 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 l ; 5 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 US gal ) of " process water " . It was intended that in the summer , when water supply was lower , it would serve as a reservoir with water pumped from the moors ; and in winter serve as a drainage channel , via gravity drainage . Geotechnical problems prevented it from being dug as deep as originally intended and so gravity @-@ drainage of the moors was not possible : thus , water is pumped up into the river throughout the year . 
 The Sowy River between the River Parrett and King 's Sedgemoor Drain was completed in 1972 . The Levels and Moors are now artificially drained by a network of rhynes which are pumped up into " drains " . Water levels are managed by the Levels internal drainage boards ( IDBs ) ; the Levels are not as intensively drained or farmed as the East Anglian fens , historically a similar area of low marsh . They are still liable to widespread fresh water flooding in winter . One of the approaches to reducing the risk of flooding within the catchment area of the Parrett is the planting of new woodlands . 
 Controversy about the management of the drainage and flood protection has previously involved the activities of IDBs . However , IDBs have been actively participating with the Parrett Catchment Partnership , a partnership of 30 organisations that aims to create a consensus on how water is to be managed , in particular , looking at new ways to achieve sustainable benefits for all local stakeholders . 
 During 2009 and 2010 , work was undertaken to upgrade sluice gates , watercourses , and culverts to enable seasonal flooding of Southlake Moor during the winter diverting water from the Sowy River onto the moor . It has the capacity to hold 1 @.@ 2 million cubic metres as part of a scheme by the Parrett Internal Drainage Board to restore ten floodplains in Somerset . In spring , the water is drained away to enable the land to be used as pasture during the summer . The scheme is also used to encourage water birds . 
 = = = Sea defences = = = 
 The Levels were frequently flooded by the sea during high tides , a problem that was not resolved until the sea defences were enhanced in the early 20th century . In addition , the problems of high fresh water floods are aggravated by the unrestricted entry of the tide along the Parrett , which is the only river in the Levels and Moors that does not have a clyse on it . Discussions on whether a clyse is needed for the Parrett and whether it should be sited at Bridgwater or nearer the mouth of the river date back to 1939 , at the start of World War II , and have not been resolved . 
 On 13 December 1981 , a large storm hit the North Somerset coast . Meteorological conditions caused a large rising surge in sea level in the Bristol Channel , and wind was measured at 40 knots ( 74 km / h ; 46 mph ) . Over topping of the sea defences along a 7 miles ( 11 km ) stretch of the Somerset coast at 22 locations from Clevedon to Porlock began after 19 : 30 . Although there was no loss of life , the resultant flooding covered 12 @,@ 500 acres ( 5 @,@ 100 ha ) of land , affecting 1 @,@ 072 houses and commercial properties , with £ 150 @,@ 000 worth of livestock killed and £ 50 @,@ 000 of feed and grain destroyed . Wessex Water Authority estimated the total cost of the damage caused at £ 6M . This resulted in a three @-@ year programme of sea defence assessment , repair and improvement . With 400 properties affected in Burnham @-@ on @-@ Sea , after emergency repairs , Wessex Water Authority began planning new sea defences . Construction work started in 1983 on a £ 7M scheme , creating what was then Britain ’ s biggest wave return wall . 
 The Environment Agency 's current " Parrett Catchment Flood Management Plan " , published in December 2009 , divides the Parrett catchment area into eight sub @-@ areas , with the Somerset Levels and Moors falling into sub @-@ area 6 and Bridgwater falling into sub @-@ area 7 . As part of the published flood risk assessments for both these sub @-@ areas , it is recognised that : at a future date a tidal clyse may be needed on the Parrett ; this causes a funding dilemma ; and , geomorphology studies of the Parrett and the Tone are needed to help address many of the uncertainties associated with a tidal exclusion project . 
 = = = Flooding = = = 
 The Levels are at risk from both tidal and land @-@ based flood waters . 
 During the great storm of 1703 , waves came four feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) over the sea walls . The sea wall was again breached in 1799 , filling the Axe valley with sea water . In 1872 , another flood covered 7 @,@ 000 acres ( 28 km2 ) and in 1919 , 70 @,@ 000 acres ( 283 km2 ) were inundated with sea water , poisoning the land for up to 7 years . 
 Since 1990 , the drainage boards have been charged with watching the rhynes and keeping them clear , under the overall responsibility of the Environment Agency . With rising sea levels , the work required to maintain the sea defences is likely to become more expensive , and it has been proposed that two inland seas be created . Other studies have recommended maintaining the current defences for five years while undertaking further studies of available options . 
 Although the Environment Agency have made plans for the regular winter flooding , still in recent years this has resulted in a number of villages — including Langport , Muchelney and Westonzoyland — being cut off . In November 2012 , during the 2012 Great Britain and Ireland floods , after six days Somerset County Council @-@ funded BARB rescue boats reached Muchelney on 29 November , rescuing nearly 100 people . 
 Rescue boats were again required during the rain and storms from Cyclone Dirk in the turn of the year 2014 , and subsequently during the Winter flooding of 2013 – 14 on the Somerset Levels . On 24 January 2014 , in light of the continued flooded extent of the Somerset Moors and forecast new rainfall as part of the Winter storms of 2013 – 14 in the United Kingdom , both Somerset County Council and Sedgemoor District Council declared a major incident . At this time , with 17 @,@ 000 acres ( 6 @,@ 900 ha ) of agricultural land having been under water for over a month , the village of Thorney had been abandoned and Muchelney had been cut off by flood waters for almost a month . Environment Minister Owen Paterson visited the area on 27 January 2014 , and after meeting local MPs , the Environment Agency and various community representatives the night before in Taunton , promised at a media @-@ only press conference at North Moor pumping station that if a local water management plan could be developed over the next six weeks , he would approve it . Such plan would likely include the dredging of the rivers Tone and Parrett , and possibly a later sluice near Bridgwater . There have been public protests about the river Parrett not being dredged in recent years . In mid @-@ February 2014 the Environment Agency began installing giant pumps imported from the Netherlands to alleviate the continuing flooding . 
 = = Human habitation = = 
 A Palaeolithic flint tool found in Westbury is the earliest indication of human presence in the area , dating from approximately 500 @,@ 000 years ago . Later during the 7th millennium BC the sea level rose and flooded the valleys , forcing the Mesolithic people to occupy seasonal camps on the higher ground , indicated by scatters of flints . Subsequent winter flooding probably led to prehistoric man 's using the Levels only in the summer , hence the county of Somerset may derive its name from <unk> , meaning land of the summer people . An alternative suggestion is that the name derives from Seo @-@ mere @-@ <unk> meaning " settlers by the sea lakes " . The Neolithic people continued to exploit the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways such as the Sweet and Post Tracks . The Sweet Track , named after the peat digger who discovered it in 1970 and dating from the 3800s BC , is the world 's oldest timber trackway , once thought to be the world 's oldest engineered roadway . The track was built between what was in the early 4th millennium BC an island at Westhay and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick , close to the River Brue . The remains of similar tracks have been uncovered nearby , connecting settlements on the peat bog including the Honeygore , Abbotts Way , Bells , Bakers , Westhay and Nidons trackways . 
 The Levels contain the best @-@ preserved prehistoric village in the UK , Glastonbury Lake Village , as well as two others at Meare Lake Village . Discovered in 1892 by Arthur Bulleid , it was inhabited by about 200 people living in 14 roundhouses , and was built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood , bracken , rubble and clay . Investigation of the Meare Pool indicates that it was formed by the encroachment of raised peat bogs , particularly during the Subatlantic climatic period ( 1st millennium BC ) , and core sampling demonstrates that it is filled with at least 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) of detritus mud . 
 The two villages within Meare Pool appear to originate from a collection of structures erected on the surface of the dried peat , such as tents , windbreaks and animal folds . Clay was later spread over the peat , providing raised stands for occupation , industry and movement , and in some areas thicker clay spreads accommodated hearths built of clay or stone . 
 The area continued to be inhabited during the Bronze Age , when the population supported itself largely by hunting and fishing in the surrounding marshes , living on artificial islands connected by wooden causeways on wooden piles . There have been many finds of metalwork during peat cutting , which may have been devotional offerings . Brent Knoll has been settled by people since at least the Bronze Age . It is the site of an Iron Age hill fort known as Brent Knoll Camp , with multiple ramparts ( multivallate ) following the contours of the hill . Several settlements and hill forts were built on the natural " islands " of slightly raised land , including Brent Knoll , Glastonbury , and the low range of the Polden Hills . According to legend <unk> son of <unk> , who was one of King Arthur 's knights , went to the Mount of Frogs on a quest to slay three giants who lived there . The fort has been claimed as the site of the Battle of Mons Badonicus . 
 Sea salt was extracted during the Roman period , and a string of settlements were set up along the Polden Hills . Some possible settlement sites are also known in the Draycott and Cheddar Moors and around Highbridge . The discovery at Shapwick of 9 @,@ 238 silver Roman coins , the second largest hoard ever found from the Roman Empire included coins dated from as early as 31 – 30 BC up until 224 AD . The hoard also contained two rare coins which had not been discovered in Britain before , and the largest number of silver denarii ever found in Britain . 
 A number of Anglo @-@ Saxon charters document the incorporation of areas of moor in estates , suggested that the area continued to be exploited . It is easy to see why the area acquired a number of legends , particularly of King Arthur and his followers , who some believe based his court in the hill fort at South Cadbury . According to legend , Alfred the Great burnt cakes when hiding in the marshes of Athelney , after the Danish invasion in 875 . After the battle of Edington the Danish king was baptised at Aller and a peace treaty signed at Wedmore . 
 In 1685 , the Monmouth Rebellion ended at the Battle of Sedgemoor , which was fought in the <unk> area of Westonzoyland . 
 = = Land use = = 
 The Levels have few wooded areas , just occasional willow trees . The landscape is dominated by grassland , mostly used as pasture for dairy farming with approximately 70 per cent of the area being grassland and 30 per cent arable . From January until May , the River Parrett provides a source of European eels ( Anguilla anguilla ) and young elvers , which are caught by hand netting as this is the only legal means of catching them . A series of eel passes have been built on the Parrett at the King 's Sedgemoor Drain to help this endangered species ; cameras have shown 10 @,@ 000 eels migrating upstream in a single night . The 2003 BBC Radio 4 play Glass Eels by Nell Leyshon was set on the Parrett . 
 The Levels , as part of the West Country , traditionally produced cider , with individual farms having orchards and their own cider , known as <unk> . However , over 60 % of Somerset 's orchards have been lost in the last fifty years ; and apple production occupies less than 0 @.@ 4 % of the land . Cider is still produced in Somerset by Thatchers Cider , Gaymer Cider Company and numerous small independent producers . Other local industries that once thrived on the Levels , such as thatching ( using reeds ) and basket making ( using willow ) , have been in decline since the second half of the 20th century . Combined with the recent drop in farm incomes , this poses a potential threat to the " traditional " nature of the area as a whole . Subsidies are paid to farmers who manage their land in the traditional way . 
 In 2009 , National Grid began public consultations over plans to build a line of electricity pylons , by one of two routes between Hinkley Point and Avonmouth . The plans attracted local opposition . The first consultation process ended in January 2010 . They had proposed that each pylon would be 151 feet ( 46 m ) high : the consultation was only in respect of preferences between two alternate routes , not the size nor the use of large pylons . The proposed line , which is due to open by September 2017 , will transmit electricity at 400 kilovolts from the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station . Électricité de France has begun public consultations in respect of the local infrastructure needed for the construction programme to build Hinkley Point C ; but , as of January 2011 , has not submitted applications for consents for the proposed power stations . It has , however , submitted a planning application for preliminary site preparation works , which it states that it will undo should consents for the power stations be refused . 
 In 2010 and 2011 , two proposals to build a total of 14 wind turbines , with <unk> to build five or four adjacent to the M5 Motorway near Brent Knoll and Électricité de France to build nine at East Huntspill , are opposed by local groups on the grounds of their effect on the local environment and potential damage to the bird population . 
 = = = Willow = = = 
 Willow has been cut and used on the Levels since mankind moved into the area . Fragments of willow basket were found near the Glastonbury Lake Village , and it was used in the construction of several Iron Age causeways . The willow was harvested using traditional methods of <unk> , where a tree would be cut back to the main stem . New shoots of willow , called " <unk> " , would grow out of the trunk and these would be cut periodically for use . 
 During the 1930s , over 9 @,@ 000 acres ( 36 km2 ) of willow were being grown commercially on the Levels . Largely because of the replacement of baskets by plastic bags and cardboard boxes , the industry has severely declined since the 1950s . By the end of the 20th century only about 350 acres ( 1 @.@ 4 km2 ) were grown commercially , near the villages of Burrowbridge , Westonzoyland , and North Curry . The Somerset Levels is now the only area in the UK where basket willow is grown commercially . For weaving , the species Salix triandra ( almond willow , black maul ) is grown , while Salix viminalis ( common osier ) is ideal for handles , bases , and the structural members in furniture and hurdles . Historically willow was used to make salmon traps or " <unk> " . Products including baskets , eel traps ( <unk> ) , lobster pots , and furniture were widely made from willow throughout the area in the recent past . Among the more unusual products still made are passenger baskets for hot air balloons , the frames inside the <unk> worn by the regiments of the Grenadier Guards , and an increasing number of willow coffins . 
 Another use of willow has been found by the <unk> family , who make artist 's charcoals in Stoke St Gregory . It has become in 30 years the leading artists ' charcoal manufacturer in Europe , producing most of the natural charcoals sold under different art @-@ material brands . 
 The industry is celebrated in the form of the Willow Man ( sometimes known as the Angel of the South ) , a willow sculpture , 40 feet ( 12 @.@ 2 m ) tall , produced by artist Serena de la Hey in September 2000 that can be seen from the railway and the M5 motorway to the north of Bridgwater . At Stoke St Gregory there is also a Willows and Wetlands Visitor Centre .

 An unusual crop is the growing of <unk> around the River Isle near Chard on the heavy clay soils around <unk> . These are used to provide a fine finish on <unk> and snooker table cloths . 
 = = = Peat extraction = = = 
 The extraction of peat from the Moors is known to have taken place during Roman times , and has been carried out since the Levels were first drained . The introduction of plastic packaging in the 1950s allowed the peat to be packed without rotting , which led to the industrialisation of peat extraction during the 1960s as a major market in horticultural peat was developed . The reduction in water levels that resulted put local ecosystems at risk ; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of 1 – 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 8 m ) over 100 years . Peat extraction continues today , although much reduced . 
 = = Biodiversity and conservation = = 
 As a result of their wetland nature , the Moors and Levels contain a rich biodiversity of national and international importance . They support a vast variety of plant species , including common plants such as marsh marigold , meadowsweet , and ragged robin . The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick ’ s swan , Eurasian curlew , common redshank , skylark , common snipe , common teal , wigeon , and whimbrel , as well as birds of prey including the marsh harrier and peregrine falcon . A wide range of insect species is also present , including rare invertebrates , particularly beetles including the lesser silver water beetle , <unk> <unk> , Hydrophilus piceus , Odontomyia angulata , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . In addition , the area supports an important otter population . Water voles ( Arvicola amphibius ) are being encouraged to recolonise areas of the Levels where they have been absent for 10 years , by the capture of mink ( Mustela vison ) . 
 In 2010 , a project was started to reintroduce the common crane to the Levels , after an absence of 400 years . The birds ' eggs were flown from Germany to the <unk> wetland reserve managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust ( a UK charity ) at <unk> , Gloucestershire , and reared to the age of five months before being released onto the Levels . The " Great Crane Project " aims to introduce around 20 of the birds each year until 2015 . The work , which included collaboration with <unk> Nature Reserve and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , was supported by a grant of £ <unk> from Viridor Credits . 
 The Levels contain 32 Sites of Special Scientific Interest ( 12 of them also Special Protection Areas ) , the River Huntspill and Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserves , the Somerset Levels and Moors Ramsar Site covering about 86 @,@ 000 acres ( 348 km2 ) , the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve , Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve , Ham Wall National Nature Reserve and numerous Scheduled monuments . The Brue Valley Living Landscape conservation project commenced in 2009 and aims to restore , recreate and reconnect habitat . It aims to ensure that wildlife is enhanced and capable of sustaining itself in the face of climate change while guaranteeing farmers and other landowners can continue to use their land profitably . It is one of an increasing number of landscape scale conservation projects in the UK . About 72 @,@ 000 acres ( 291 km2 ) of the Levels are recognised as an Environmentally Sensitive Area , and other areas are designated as Areas of High Archaeological Potential , but there is currently no single conservation designation covering the Levels and Moors . 
 A survey in 2005 discovered that 11 of the known wooden Bronze Age causeways on the Levels had been destroyed or vanished and others were seriously damaged , caused by the reduction in water levels and subsequent exposure of the timber to oxygen and aerobic bacteria . Part of the Sweet Track is being actively conserved . Following purchase of land by the National Heritage Memorial Fund , and installation of a water pumping and distribution system along a 550 @-@ yard ( 500 m ) section , several hundred metres of the track 's length are now being actively conserved . This method of preserving wetland archaeological remains ( i.e. maintaining a high water table and saturating the site ) is rare . A 550 @-@ yard ( 500 m ) section , which lies within the land owned by the Nature Conservancy Council , has been surrounded by a clay bank to prevent drainage into surrounding lower peat fields , and water levels are regularly monitored . The viability of this method is demonstrated by comparing it with the nearby Abbot 's Way , which has not had similar treatment , and which in 1996 was found to have become dewatered and desiccated . Evaluation and maintenance of water levels in the Shapwick Heath Nature Reserve involves the Nature Conservancy Council , the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs and the Somerset Levels Project . 
 = = Somerset Levels Project = = 
 In 1964 , archaeologist John Coles from the University of Cambridge began a research project that resulted in the publication of an important series of papers on many aspects of the Levels . A range of archaeological projects , such as the exploration of various trackways from the 3rd and 1st millennia BC and the establishment of their economic and geographic significance , was funded by various donors including English Heritage . Possibly the project 's most significant excavation was of the Sweet Track in 1970 , during which a <unk> axe was discovered . Eight radiocarbon determinations of the date of the axe place it at around 3200 BC . 
 The work of John Coles and the Somerset Levels Project was recognised in 1998 when they won the ICI Award for the best archaeological project offering a major contribution to knowledge , and in 2006 with the award of the European Archaeological Heritage Prize . 
 = = Shapwick Project = = 
 This project , based on the village of Shapwick , was begun by Mick Aston of Bristol University to investigate the evolution of a typical English village . A preliminary study of the village 's history was carried out using maps and documents , then surveys of the buildings were made together with botanical surveys . Field walking was carried out and key sites excavated . A report on the project , which ran from 1989 to 1999 , was published in eight volumes . 
 = = Tourism = = 
 Being largely flat , the Levels are well suited to bicycles , and a number of cycle routes exist including the Withy Way Cycle Route ( 22 mi or 35 km ) , Avalon Marshes Cycle Route ( 28 mi or 45 km ) , Peat Moors Cycle Route ( 24 mi or 39 km ) and the Isle Valley Cycle Route ( 28 mi or 45 km ) . The River Parrett Trail ( 47 mi or 76 km ) and Monarch 's Way long @-@ distance footpaths are also within the area . 
 Visitors ' centres aim to convey various aspects of the Levels . The Willows and Wetlands Visitor Centre near Stoke St Gregory offers tours of the willow yards and basket workshops and explains the place of willow in the history of the Levels . The Somerset Willow Company also allows visitors into its workshops . The Peat Moors Centre to the west of Glastonbury was dedicated to the archaeology , history and geology of the area . It also included reconstructions of some of the archaeological discoveries , including a number of Iron Age round houses and the world 's oldest engineered highway , the Sweet Track . From time to time the centre offered courses in a number of ancient technologies in subjects including textiles , clothing and basket making , as well as staging various open days , displays and demonstrations . In February 2009 Somerset County Council , the owners of the Peat Moors Centre , announced their intention of closing the centre and it finally shut on 31 October 2009 . 
 The Tribunal in Glastonbury , a medieval merchant 's house , contains possessions and works of art from the Glastonbury Lake Village , which were preserved in almost perfect condition in the peat after the village was abandoned . It also houses the tourist information centre . Also in Glastonbury , the Somerset Rural Life Museum is a museum of the social and agricultural history of Somerset , housed in buildings surrounding a 14th @-@ century barn once belonging to Glastonbury Abbey . It was used as a tithe barn for the storage of arable produce , particularly wheat and rye , from the abbey 's home farm of approximately 524 acres ( 2 @.@ 12 km2 ) . <unk> and winnowing would also have been carried out in the barn . The barn which was built from local " shelly " limestone , with thick timbers supporting the stone tiling of the roof . It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building , and is a Scheduled monument . The barn and courtyard contain displays of farm machinery from the Victorian and early 20th century periods . Other exhibits show local crafts , including willow coppicing , mud horse fishing on the flats of Bridgwater Bay , peat digging on the Somerset Levels and the production of milk , cheese , and cider . In reconstructed rooms detailing domestic life in the nearby village of Butleigh , the story of one farm worker , John Hodges , is told from cradle to grave . Outside , there is a beehive and rare breeds of poultry and sheep in the cider apple orchard . 
 The Langport & River Parrett Visitor Centre at Langport details local life , history , and wildlife . The Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum , near the town on the River Parrett , is housed in one of the earliest steam @-@ powered pumping stations on the Levels , dating from the 1830s ; it was closed in the 1950s . Featuring several steam engines , some built locally , the museum holds a number of live steam days each year . The pump house has been Grade II * listed , and is on English Heritage 's Heritage at Risk Register . 
 As of 2009 , the tourist authorities in the area were seeking to establish the term " Avalon Marshes " as the new name of the Somerset Moors . 
 = Clan Macfie = 
 Clan Macfie is a Scottish clan . Since 1981 , the clan has been officially registered with the Court of the Lord Lyon , which is the heraldic authority of Scotland . The clan is considered an armigerous clan because even though the clan is recognised by the Court of the Lord Lyon , it is currently without a chief recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms , the judge of the Court of the Lord Lyon . The official clan name Macfie is derived from the Gaelic Mac <unk> . This Gaelic patronymic name has been Anglicised into various forms , many of which are considered associated names of the clan . The clan has a long history with the islands of Colonsay and Oronsay in the Scottish Inner Hebrides , and today many monuments to various lairds and churchmen of the clan are found on these islands . 
 The 19th century historian W. F. Skene named the clan as one of the seven clans of Siol Alpin — who according to Skene could all trace their ancestry back to Alpin , father of Cináed mac Ailpín . Popular tradition has been until recently to consider Cináed mac Ailpín the first King of Scots and a Gael ; however , recent research has shown he was actually a Pictish king and likely a Pict himself . 
 Little is known of the early history of the clan . However , is certain that the clan served under the Lords of the Isles — descendants of Somerled , who ruled the Hebrides from the 14th century to the late 16th century . Following the forfeiture of the Lordship of the Isles in the late 15th century , the clan still attached itself to powerful Macdonalds . In the early 17th century the last chief of the clan was executed as Colonsay was lost to the control of a Macdonald . Without a chief of their own to control their home lands the clan was considered a leaderless " broken clan " . From this point on the Macfies followed the Macdonalds of Islay , though a branch of the clan was dispersed to lands controlled by Clan Cameron . In the early 19th century Ewen Macphee became a notorious outlaw , " revered and feared by locals and despised by the authorities " . Today the modern Clan Macfie is alive with nine associated clan societies located around the world . 
 = = History = = 
 The 19th @-@ century historian W. F. Skene , stated that members of Clan Macfie were the ancient inhabitants of Colonsay . He also wrote that the clan was one of the seven clans of Siol Alpin , and that " their genealogy , which is preserved in the manuscript of 1450 , evinces their connexion by descent with the <unk> and Mackinnons " . The seven clans of Siol Alpin could , according to Skene , trace their descent from Alpin , father of the traditional first King of Scots : Cináed mac Ailpín . However , even while stating all this , he wrote that there was nothing known about the early history of Clan Macfie . Over a century after Skene , W. D. H. Sellar wrote that according to later Gaelic tradition , <unk> , ancestor of Clan Macfie , fostered Aonghas Mór , Lord of Islay ( Sellar describes Aonghas Mór as the first MacDonald ) . 
 Martin , in his A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland of 1703 , wrote that on the south side of the church of St. Columba on Oronsay , were the tombstones of MacDuffie ( or Macfie , a former chief of the clan ) and the cadets of his family . The principal stone bore the engraving of a birlinn , two handed claymore and the inscription " Hic <unk> <unk> MacDuffie de <unk> " ( " Here lies <unk> MacDuffie of Colonsay " ) . The burial place of the Macfies was a small chapel , on the south side of the church on Oronsay . Another stone is for Sir Donald MacDuffie , who was abbot of Oronsay when Donald Munro , High Dean of the Isles , toured the Western Isles in 1549 . 
 According to a manuscript , written in the 17th century , pertaining to the coronation of the Lords of the Isles , and the Council of the Isles , " MacDuffie , or <unk> of Colonsay , kept the records of the Isles " . In 1463 Macfie of Colonsay was a member of the Council of the Isles , listed as Donald <unk> , a witness to a charter by John of Islay , Earl of Ross , the last Lord of the Isles , dated 12 April at the Earl 's castle of Dingwall . After the fall of the Lordship of the Isles the Macfies followed the MacDonalds of Islay . In 1531 , the chief of the clan , " <unk> <unk> de <unk> " , and many other west highland chiefs were cited for treason and summoned to Parliament as supporters of the rebellious Alexander MacDonald of Dunivaig and the Glens . This Macfie chief died in 1539 and his impressive tombstone can still be seen ( pictured left ) . 
 Donald Munro , High Dean of the Isles , in his A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland Called <unk> , in 1549 , described the island of Jura as partly controlled by Maclean of Duart , Maclaine of <unk> , and Macfie of Colonsay . In describing the island of Colonsay , Monro wrote that it had once been held by Macdonald of Kintyre , but was then currently ruled by a " gentle <unk> , callit M ’ <unk> " — gentle meaning ' well @-@ born ' , and captain being the old styling of ' chief ' . 
 By 1587 , atrocities committed between warring west highland clans had escalated to such an extent that Parliament devised what is known as the General Band in an effort to quell hostilities . The band was signed by landowners throughout the Scottish highlands , borders and the islands , requiring them to be responsible for the men who lived within their lands . The signing chiefs were required to come up with sureties equal to their wealth and lands for the peaceful conduct of their followers . In it the laird of Colonsay , " M <unk> of <unk> " ( Murdoch Macfie of Colonsay ) , is listed as one of the landlords in the Scottish highlands and islands where broken men ( or lawless men ) dwelt . Despite the Governments actions to secure the peace , about this time Lachlan Mor MacLean of Duart ravaged the MacDonald islands of Islay and Gigha , slaughtering 500 — 600 men . Maclean of Duart then besieged Angus MacDonald of Dunivaig and the Glens at his Castle Dunivaig . The siege was only lifted when Macdonald of Dunivaig and the Glens agreed with Maclean of Duart to surrender half of his lands on Islay . However , despite his agreement with the Macleans , Macdonald of Dunivaig and the Glens then invaded the Maclean islands of Mull , Tiree , Coll and Luing . Angus Macdonald of Dunivaig and the Glens was aided in the action by Donald Gorm Mor Macdonald of Sleat and many west highland clans such as the Macdonalds of Clanranald , <unk> of Ardnamurchan , Macleods of Lewis , MacNeills of Gigha , <unk> of Loup and also the Macfies of Colonsay . Supporting Maclean of Duart were the Macleods of Harris and Dunvegan , MacNeils of Barra , Mackinnons of <unk> and the <unk> of Ulva . 
 In 1609 , " Donald <unk> in <unk> " was present at the assembly of island chiefs and gentlemen , who met with the Bishop of the Isles at Iona , when the nine Statutes of <unk> were enacted , which were to bring the Western Isles under the control of the Scottish Parliament . 
 = = = Fall of the clan = = = 
 In 1615 Malcolm Macfie of Colonsay supported Sir James Macdonald of Islay , Chief of " Clan Donald South " , after Macdonald had escaped from Edinburgh Castle . Macfie was one of the principal leaders in Macdonald 's rebellion against the Government , who had promised Islay to the Campbells . The combined forces of Macfie and Donald <unk> <unk> , who was the leading man on the nearby isle of Jura , contributed a total of 64 men to the Macdonald rebellion . When Sir James Macdonald 's force of 400 men landed in at Kinloch ( <unk> ) in Kintyre , they were made up in part by the " special men " from Islay , Macfie of Colonsay , Donald <unk> of Jura , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and North Islesmen . 
 The Earl of Argyll later secured the submission of Colla Ciotach MacDonald , who was another chief of Clan Donald South . Colla Ciotach then captured Malcolm Macfie of Colonsay , among eighteen others , and handed them over to the Earl of Argyll . Malcolm Macfie , along with another rebel leader , received assurance for their lives by serving on the Government 's side against the rebels while in the company of the Earl of Argyll . The Earl , in late 1615 , presented the captured to the Privy Council . 
 For several years both Colla Ciotach and the Macfie chief lived on Colonsay , with Colla Ciotach residing at <unk> and Macfie at Dùn <unk> . During this time the two feuded . Judging by the many hiding places which bear his name , such as <unk> ' <unk> Mhic a <unk> ( " MacPhee 's Hiding Place " ) , Macfie was chased from one to another for quite sometime . Finally , in 1623 , Malcolm Macfie was chased from Colonsay and pursued to Eilean nan <unk> ( south @-@ west of Oronsay ) . There , on the south @-@ western corner of Eilean nan <unk> , called an t Eilean <unk> , he was spotted and taken by the MacDonalds . Popular lore has it that the Macfie chief was finally discovered when his hiding place amongst the seaweed was given away by a gull . As it hovered over Macfie 's position , Colla Ciotach 's men were alerted by its cry and spotted the clan chief on a ledge of rock at the edge of the sea . After being apprehended , the chief was then tied to a stone and summarily shot . Colla Ciotach , and several of his followers , appear in the Council Records in 1623 as being accused of killing the Macfie chief . Because of the death of their chief the Macfies finally lost control of Colonsay . The island then passed to the Macdonalds , as Colla Ciotach took the island for himself , and held it peacefully for many years . 
 The island was later to be absorbed into the earldom of Argyll , until it was sold in 1701 to McNeill or <unk> . Without its own chief the clan became a " broken clan " and for the most part followed the Macdonalds of Islay , with Macfies / <unk> making up only a small proportion of the total population of Colonsay . A branch of the clan , after the collapse of the clan , settled in Lochaber and followed Cameron of Lochiel , chief of Clan Cameron . A Macfie ( a Macphee of Clan Cameron ) was one of the two pipers at Glenfinnan , when on 19 August 1745 Charles Edward Stuart raised his standard and claimed both the Scottish and English throne in the name of his father James Francis Edward Stuart . The following year Macfies were among the Camerons , who were on the right flank at the Jacobite Army at the Battle of Culloden . 
 = = = = Macphee the outlaw = = = = 
 A well @-@ known character in Inverness @-@ shire , in the 19th century , was a Ewan Macphee who lived as an outlaw . Described as Scotland 's last outlaw , he recognised no landowner , stole sheep , and raised a family upon a small island . Ewan Macphee was a young man when he was enlisted by his landlord into a Highland Regiment of the British Army . Macphee was said to have been an able soldier but he soon deserted the Army and fled to his native Glengarry , where he hid living in <unk> with his sister . For the Fedden in Glengarry , <unk> @-@ <unk> states " ' <unk> Through Which the Winds Blows ' . Site of a croft which sat right on a disputed Cameron @-@ Glengarry boundary line , just below Meall an <unk> . The elderly woman who lived here managed to divert a stream each time either the Cameron or Glengarry men came to collect the rent . She managed to avoid paying rent for years , claiming her home was on the other side of the boundary stream " . His Regiment then sent a troop of soldiers to arrest him for desertion , though just as Macphee was about to be taken handcuffed aboard a steamer at <unk> , he managed to escape and fled his captors . Ewan Macphee lived for two years around the shores of Loch Arkaig before building a bothy on a small island in Loch <unk> , which has since born his name : <unk> Mhic Phee ( translation from Scottish Gaelic : " MacPhee 's island " ) . Macphee then took for his wife a fourteen @-@ year @-@ old girl , who lived across the hill in Glen <unk> . As time passed Macphee was feared and looked upon by the poor inhabitants of the glen as a seer . Macphee believed himself to have supernatural powers , he weaved charms and cattle were brought to him to be cured . As the years past neighbouring shepherds finally decided to put an end to Macphee 's sheep stealing , and the sheriff sent two officers to confront Macphee . As the officers rowed to his island they were fired upon by Macphee 's wife and the officers fled . A week later an armed party was then sent and Ewan Macphee was finally arrested and taken to prison , where he eventually died .

 In 1864 , the first Macfies to have coats of arms registered in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland were Robert Macfie of <unk> and <unk> and Robert Andrew Macfie of Dreghorn — two highly successful businessmen in the sugar industry . The heraldic crest within the clan 's crest badge is actually derived from the heraldic crest on the coat of arms of Robert Andrew Macfie of Dreghorn . In 1968 , Earle Douglas MacPhee of Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada started a movement to have the Clan Macfie officially registered with the Lord Lyon King of Arms . On 10 May 1977 , the Macfie Standing Stone on <unk> on Colonsay was dedicated as a memorial to the last chief of the clan , who was executed against it in 1623 . In May 1981 , Clan Macfie was formally recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms and later in November of that year , Earle MacPhee was appointed as Commander of Clan Macfie by the Lord Lyon King of Arms . Following Earle MacPhee 's death in 1982 , Alexander ( Sandy ) <unk> <unk> of Australia was appointed by the Lord Lyon King of Arms as Commander of Clan Macfie on 7 September 1989 . In March 2008 , the Lord Lyon gave permission for Clan Macfie to convene an ad hoc derbhfine to choose a successor to <unk> , who had by then decided to step down . Iain Morris <unk> was chosen to petition the Lord Lyon , and on doing so was later appointed as Commander of Clan Macfie . 
 Today there are nine clan societies associated with Clan Macfie . The societies are located around the world in Australia , Canada , New Zealand , Scotland , Sweden , and the United States of America . An ongoing surname DNA project is being conducted to help discover the clan 's genetic roots and to determine how people with the same surname or similar surname are related . Currently , ( as of April 2009 ) there are 132 participants in the project . To date , the project has found 40 separate bloodlines out of the total number of participants . The largest bloodline , which consists of 25 % of the total participants , and also contains the line of the last ' McPhee ' on Colonsay , is currently thought to represent the original male line of the clan . The vast majority of bloodlines , including the largest , are within the Haplogroup R1b which the project describes in layman 's terms as " Celtic " .

 = = = Origin of the name = = = 
 The origin of name Macfie ( and its variations ) is from the Gaelic Mac <unk> , which means " son of <unk> " . This Gaelic personal name is composed of two elements : dubh ( " black " ) + <unk> ( " peace " ) . An early bearer of this personal name is recorded in the Annals of Ulster . This Dub Sidhe ( <unk> ) was listed being the lector of the monastic community at Iona in the year 1164 . The name Macfie ( and its variations ) is rendered as Mac a ' <unk> in modern Scottish Gaelic . 
 According to a passage in the Carmina Gadelica , which was a collection of Gaelic folkloric poems from 1855 to 1910 , there was a family on North Uist which was known as Dubh @-@ <unk> ( translation from Gaelic : " black fairy " ) , " from a tradition that the family have been familiar with the fairies in their fairy flights and secret migrations " . This family were the North Uist MacCuishes , who also for a time , commonly bore <unk> as a given name . There were never many MacCuishes on the Uists , and after a time <unk> ceased to be used as a given name there , though it carried on in Cape Breton , Nova Scotia , Canada , taking the forms of <unk> , Duffus and even David . These MacCuishes ( of North Uist and Skye ) are considered septs of Clan Donald . 
 = = = = Genealogy according to MS 1467 = = = = 
 In the early 19th century , Skene found and transcribed a 15th @-@ century Gaelic manuscript which gave the genealogies of many Highland clans . He first published his transcriptions and translations of it in the early 19th century Collectanea de Rebus Albanicis , and later with revisions in the late 19th century — in his chief work Celtic Scotland . Today the manuscript , which Skene named MS 1450 and later MS 1467 , is stored in the National Library of Scotland . The manuscript was written by <unk> Albanach mac <unk> <unk> , in 1467 at <unk> , Co Tipperary . The following is Skene 's versions of the genealogy attributed to the chiefs of Clan Macfie in the manuscript ; first as in Collectanea de Rebus Albanicis secondly as in Celtic Scotland . 
 According to Skene in Collectanea de Rebus Albanicis , the Donald first mentioned may be the Donald MacDuffie who is recorded as witnessing a charter by John , Earl of Ross and Lord of the Isles in 1463 . In Celtic Scotland , Skene thought it was possible the mentioned <unk> / <unk> was identical to the lector of Iona recorded in 1164 within the Irish annals . 
 = = = Clan symbols ( crest badge and clan badges ) = = = 
 Scottish crest badges are used by clan members to show their allegiance to their clan and chief . Much like clan tartans , crest badges owe their popularity to Victorian romanticism . Crest badges are heraldic badges which usually contain the heraldic crest of the clan chief , encircled with a buckle containing the chief 's heraldic motto . However , in the case of Clan Macfie , which does not have a chief , the crest badge is derived from the coat of arms of Macfie of Dreghorn , who was one of the first Macfies to register a coat of arms in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland . The crest badge of Clan Macfie contains as a crest : a demi lion rampant , proper . The motto which encircles the crest is : pro rege , which translated from Latin means " for the king " . 
 Although today crest badges are more commonly used by clan members , the original badges worn by clansmen were plant badges or clan badges . Clan badges consisted of plants which were worn on a bonnet or attached to a pole or spear . There have been several clan badges attributed to Clan Macfie , and the clans shares the use of them with several associated clans . Clan badges attributed to Clan Macfie include : scots pine ( Scottish Gaelic : <unk> ) , attributed to all seven of the clans of Siol Alpin ; oak ( Scottish Gaelic : <unk> ) , also attributed to Clan Cameron ; crowberry ( Scottish Gaelic : <unk> <unk> ) , also attributed to Clan Maclean and Clan Cameron . 
 = = = Tartan = = = 
 The clan 's official " Clan Macfie Tartan " was registered in the Books of the Court of the Lord Lyon King of Arms on 29 August 1991 . It is possible the tartan may date back to about the time of the first Macfie coats of arms were registered in the mid 19th century . However , it was first recorded in 1906 , in Johnston 's The Tartans of the Clans and Septs of Scotland . The tartan is very similar to the MacIver tartan — swapping the colour green for the MacIver black . However , it has been said that the colours ( red , green and yellow ) and the general appearance of the Macfie tartan are similar to the Cameron tartan , and that it may allude to the dependence on Clan Cameron of several Macfies after the collapse of their clan . The Clan Cameron Association considers the surnames MacPhee , <unk> and <unk> as a sept ( members , or followers ) of Clan Cameron . 
 = = Associated clans and names = = 
 Today there are many variations of the clan name Macfie , meaning " son of <unk> " . People who bear such surnames are considered members of the clan . Clan Macfie also has historical links with other clans , such as Clan Cameron . As already stated , several members of Clan Macfie emigrated to lands controlled by Clan Cameron in the 17th century , and that Clan Cameron considers certain variations of Macfie as septs of theirs . There may be also a link between Clan Macfie and the MacNichols of Glenorchy . These MacNichols are considered a sept of Clan Campbell . The origin of the MacNichols of Glenorchy and <unk> is unknown . Niall Campbell , 10th Duke of Argyll maintained they were originally <unk> of <unk> . However , local tradition had it that they were originally <unk> , descended from Nicol MacPhee who left the Cameron controlled Lochaber region in the 16th century . According to Somerled MacMillan , there were recently ( 1971 ) many MacNichols in Lochaber who were supposed to descend from the members of Clan Macfie . Though they were to have held lands in the Lochaber area since before 1493 .

 Blaster Master is a platform and run and gun video game released by Sunsoft for the Nintendo Entertainment System . It is a localized version of a Japanese Famicom game titled Chô Wakusei Senki Metafight ( <unk> ? , which loosely translates to " Super Planetary War Records : Metafight " ) ( also simply called Metafight or Meta Fight ) , which was released on June 17 , 1988 ( 1988 @-@ 06 @-@ 17 ) . The game was released in North America in November 1988 and in Europe on April 25 , 1991 ( 1991 @-@ 04 @-@ 25 ) . The game is the first in the Blaster Master series , and it spawned two spin @-@ off titles as well as two sequels . 
 The game features a character named Jason who follows his pet frog Fred down a hole in the earth . There he finds a tank and uses it to battle radioactive mutants . The player controls Jason and the tank Sophia the 3rd through eight levels of gameplay to find the whereabouts of Fred and to defeat the mutants and their leader , the Plutonium Boss . The game was praised for its smooth play control and level designs , detailed and clean graphics , and music , and it was criticized for its high difficulty level and lack of passwords or save points . The game was novelized by Peter Lerangis , as part of the Worlds of Power series published by Scholastic Books . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Chou Wakusei Senki Metafight , the game takes place on the planet Sophia the 3rd , located near the center of the Epsilon Milky Way , in which an advanced civilization flourished . In the year 2052 , the emperor Goez , who has conquered the rest of outer space and declared himself as a god , and his " <unk> Dark Star Cluster " invade and conquer Sophia the 3rd . The only survivor of Goez 's raid is the Science Academy 's Nora Satellite , who has escaped and plans to build a weapon to defeat Goez 's forces . They build an all @-@ purpose tank called " Metal Attacker " that is driven by a boy named Kane Gardner to take the lead in the counterattack . The game 's opening sequence shows Metal Attacker dropped into the battlefield . 
 The plot of the adapted Western release ( Blaster Master ) is shown at the beginning in a cinematic slideshow as ominous music plays in the background . The game starts with a person named Jason who has a pet frog named Fred who , one day , decides to leap out of his fish bowl and out the door . Fred then touches a radioactive chest , and he grows to an <unk> size ; Fred and the chest then fall into a hole in the earth . Jason chases Fred down the hole , which leads to a large underground cavern . While most sources say that Jason chased Fred down the hole , the game 's instruction manual says that Jason fell into the hole while trying to reach for Fred . There , he finds an armored tank named SOPHIA THE <unk> – a vehicle designed to battle radioactive mutants that live inside the earth . Jason mounts SOPHIA to find the whereabouts of Fred and to destroy the mutants and their leader – the Plutonium Boss . The opening sequence has been described as " one of the greatest scenes in all of video games " . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Blaster Master has two modes of gameplay that depends on the situation and location of the player . The first mode is where the player controls SOPHIA in a two – dimensional platform mode ; the second mode is where the player controls Jason while outside SOPHIA in either the same 2D platform mode or in a top @-@ down perspective . Gameplay in the top @-@ down perspective consists of a series of labyrinths in which players navigate and defeat enemies along the way . Gameplay is non @-@ linear , and players must return to earlier levels in order to advance to later levels in the game . The objective is to complete all eight levels and destroy the mutants and their bosses with various weaponry such as guns , grenades , and special weapons . 
 While Jason is inside SOPHIA in the 2D platforming mode , the player can attack the mutants with the main cannon ( which can shoot up , left , and right determined by the orientation of the tank ) or with one of three special weapons . Special weapons have limited ammunition which must be collected from exploring the game . They include the following : homing missiles that , when fired , shoot 1 missile at each enemy on screen up to 4 ; " Thunder Break " , which fires a high @-@ damage lightning bolt downward ; and " Multi Warhead Missiles " , which simultaneously fires a set of three missiles at enemies in front of and diagonally up and down . Players select their special weapon and monitor the amounts of each special weapon left by accessing the Menu Screen by pressing the Start button . 
 Gameplay in the top @-@ down perspective consists of a series of labyrinths in which players defeat enemies along the way . The player switches between the 2D platforming mode and the top @-@ down perspective by leaving the tank and entering small doorways located throughout the game . While in the top @-@ down perspective , players can move Jason in any direction and destroy mutants with a gun or with hand grenades . In this mode , players upgrade the gun by collecting gun capsules , but the gun degrades by one point if Jason receives damage from mutants or hazardous objects . Here players obtain additional vehicle functions by destroying bosses ; these functions include weapon upgrades as well as abilities to swim freely underwater , drive on walls and ceilings , and hover above the ground . The game has a glitch – colloquially known as the " grenade glitch " – to easily defeat four of the game 's <unk> . To exploit this glitch , the player throws a grenade at the boss , and while the grenade is exploding and causing damage on the boss , the player pauses the game . While the remainder of the action on the screen freezes , the grenade remains active , continuing to damage the boss . After fifteen seconds the player <unk> the game to find that the boss is destroyed . 
 Jason and SOPHIA have separate power meters , and they decrease whenever they sustain damage by an enemy or any other hazardous object or whenever Jason falls from a high place . Players can replenish these power meters by collecting power capsules that appear throughout the game . Also , the player can replenish Jason 's health to full at any time by re @-@ entering SOPHIA . The player loses a life if either power meter runs out , and the game ends when all lives are lost . Players get five continues that allow them to restart the game at the same level in which they have lost all their lives . A " hover gauge " monitors the amount of thrust remaining in SOPHIA and is located on the left side of the screen above the power meter ; additional thrust can be obtained by collecting hover capsules .

 The game was released by Sunsoft in Japan as Chô Wakusei Senki Metafight ( also simply called Metafight or Meta Fight ) on June 17 , 1988 ( 1988 @-@ 06 @-@ 17 ) . It was released under the title Blaster Master in North America in November 1988 and in Europe on April 25 , 1991 ( 1991 @-@ 04 @-@ 25 ) . Metafight , along with Ripple Island , was re @-@ released for the PlayStation in Volume 4 of Sunsoft 's Memorial Series in 2002 . The game was released for the Wii 's Virtual Console service in North America on December 14 , 2009 ( 2009 @-@ 12 @-@ 14 ) . The game 's Virtual Console release marked Sunsoft 's first North American release since deciding to return to developing video games for the Western market through its partnership with <unk> . Metafight was released for the Virtual Console in Japan on June 29 , 2010 ( 2010 @-@ 06 @-@ 29 ) for the Wii and on September 5 , 2012 ( 2012 @-@ 09 @-@ 05 ) for the Nintendo 3DS . It was also released in North America for the 3DS on July 24 , 2014 ( 2014 @-@ 07 @-@ 24 ) along with another Sunsoft game <unk> : The Saga , which released for the Wii U. 
 Blaster Master was created by Yoshiaki Iwata ( credited as <unk> . ) , who would also direct the reimagining Blaster Master : Overdrive . The game was made by a part @-@ time development team of about five people , which included a main programmer , sub @-@ programmer , lead designer , character designer , and sound programmer . Iwata did the game 's opening sequence and designed the map , overall layout , and bosses ; and he oversaw all phases of the game 's development . In a 2010 interview , Iwata said : " we were trying to make the best action game to date , with all that entails . With SOPHIA ( the game ’ s vehicle ) , we wanted to bring to life a sense of action that incorporated all 360 ° of the environment in a way that players hadn ’ t really experienced up to that point . Along with that , we wanted large , expansive maps so that we could support that vision . " 
 The game 's design came from Iwata , who was able to transport his original ideas directly into the game as far as the NES ' graphical capabilities could be taken at that time . He said : " the goal was really to try to pull off the best graphics on the NES to date . Simple graphics were more or less the standard on the NES at the time but I had this firm belief that it was possible to do something better , something prettier . I feel like we pulled it off and were able to show people what could be done [ on the NES ] . It left an impression around the office , and from what I 've heard [ the visuals ] influenced the work of other games that were later made by other NES developers as well . " The game 's music and sound were designed in cooperation between Sunsoft 's staff and an outside composer , Naoki <unk> , who had previously worked on scores for many of the company 's other titles . Iwata credited him for giving the company a good reputation for video game music in the late 1980s and lamented that " none of those people are working together anymore since they 've all separated from Sunsoft [ over the years ] " . 
 The other members of Blaster Master 's development team created the system of alternating between the 2D platforming and top @-@ down modes . During the game 's planning , the team came up with the idea that SOPHIA would eventually be able to go anywhere in the game , including navigating on the ceilings and walls . The team created the top @-@ down portions to allow Jason to shoot in all directions and to enable them to " express large bosses that really had an impact " . They did not want to design the gameplay in a linear progression ; instead they drew inspiration from and were influenced by Nintendo 's Metroid to create a game that allowed players to freely move between levels . According to Iwata : " We wanted the player to experience the feeling of excitement that comes from discovering something after endeavoring through a difficult search , which is why we composed a map that allowed the player to move freely between different areas . We really put a great deal of thought into that element of the game design and , I mean this in the best possible way , but we wanted the player to have to struggle . " 
 The game was localized from Metafight in Japan to Blaster Master for Western markets . In North America , plot elements normally present in anime ( as featured in Metafight ) were not yet popular ; Sunsoft 's U.S. division asked the Japanese development team to change the game 's original plot elements . Hence , the game 's plot changed to that of Jason and his pet frog Fred , and name of the planet " Sophia the 3rd " in Metafight became the name of Jason 's tank in Blaster Master . The original staff also omitted a portion of the map in the fourth level in which " the player was forced to control Jason and make a desperate suicide @-@ leap for a ladder suspended in mid @-@ air , " after complaints from the U.S. staff . 
 = = Reception = = 
 While Sunsoft 's development team , headed by Iwata , were confident that they produced a great game , Chô Wakusei Senki Metafight did not sell well in Japan and , as a result , was not received well within Sunsoft . No sequel was originally planned due to the game 's poor sales ; Iwata already started development on another game when the North American release Blaster Master sold well . The game 's impact led Sunsoft to develop titles with similar top @-@ down gameplay like Gremlins 2 : The New Batch and <unk> 's Quest , the latter of whose main designer had helped design the characters for Blaster Master . Iwata incorporated many of the gameplay elements in the remake Blaster Master : Overdrive , which his goal was " for players to recall and think back upon ( the original ) Blaster Master , and so my goal was to find a way to evoke that through this game . " 
 Blaster Master received praise from reviewers for its gameplay . In a 1988 Electronic Game Player ( later known as Electronic Gaming Monthly ) review , Steve Ryno lauded the concept of combining two " radically different " video game genres into one continuous game . He added that the top @-@ down portion contributes further to the depth of gameplay and said that " everything works well without the game becoming crowded or unbalanced " . The game was featured as one of the " Truly Awesome " games in Game Players ' 1988 buyer 's guide . In a 1992 review in UK magazine Mean Machines , Julian Rignall , praised the overall gameplay and the tank 's control and movements , while co @-@ reviewer Matt Regan enjoyed the game 's fast @-@ paced gameplay and abundance of rooms and bonus areas to explore . Jeremy Parish from 1UP.com praised the gameplay , saying that the player can explore the map " Metroidvania style " in a large , responsive tank while occasionally having to leave the tank to explore on foot – something that he compares to the Warthog sequences in the original Halo video game . Nintendo Life 's Corbie Dillard praised the game 's responsive controls and for its non @-@ linearity . GamesRadar ranked it the 21st best NES game ever made and felt that it was ahead of its time . 
 The game received positive reviews for its graphics and sound . Ryno praised the attention to detail in the graphics , adding that they transition well between levels as new and diverse environments are introduced . He also praised the fluid animation and movement of creatures in the top @-@ down perspective and its music ; he found music " pleasing " and noted that different tracks were scored for each separate level . Dillard praised the game 's impressive graphics , saying that the graphics are varied , distinctive , and well @-@ drawn ; he adds that Sunsoft " did their homework " in this regard . He called the music in the game as one of the best chiptunes in the 8 @-@ bit era , noting the up @-@ tempo tracks and high @-@ quality sound effects . IGN 's Mark <unk> <unk> described the music " as memorable as anything from Nintendo " , while Regan said that the game 's sound effects and music bolster the gameplay and graphical atmosphere . 
 One of the main criticisms of Blaster Master has been its difficulty . IGN 's Levi Buchanan mentioned the lack of passwords or save features as used in Metroid ; the game had to be completed in one sitting . They added that some players need to exploit the " grenade glitch " to beat some of the bosses . Buchanan criticized the game for its difficulty in the on @-@ foot portions , saying that the bosses are too difficult to beat , that the enemies regenerate upon re @-@ entering a screen , and that players can lose a life from falling too far in the 2D platforming mode . IGN 's Lucas Thomas agreed about the lack of passwords or save features , saying that because of the game 's difficulty , dying near the end of the game and having to restart the game all over again without passwords or save points have caused much frustration for players . Parish criticized the game for having a limited number of continues and for the graphics in the top @-@ down perspective , saying that the display is " incredibly cutesy compared to the tank sections , with the protagonist 's head providing about 50 % of his total body mass " . 
 Some reviewers have found other criticisms in the gameplay . Buchanan mentioned that the character holds his gun in his right hand , requiring the player to compensate by moving left before shooting enemies ( if the player can move left on the screen ) . Thomas echoed Buchanan 's concerns in a later review , adding that this requires players to mentally adjust and to target enemies off @-@ center . Thomas criticized the control of the tank , in particular the lack of traction , which he said may cause players to roll off a platform or cliff . Parish criticized the gameplay in the top @-@ down perspective , saying that the gun the players uses is too weak ; he continues by adding that there are too few upgrades for it and that , whenever the player takes damage , it downgrades from a " high @-@ powered beam of death " to " a stupid unreliable peashooter of mild discomfort " . 
 The game has received notable recognitions in gaming magazines . It was featured on the cover of the premiere issue of VideoGames & Computer Entertainment in December 1988 . Electronic Gaming Monthly listed the game at # 1 in its " Top Ten Games " list in the premiere issue . In Nintendo Power , the game debuted at # 12 in its " Top 30 " NES games list in its March – April 1989 issue ; it later climbed to # 6 from May to August 1989 , before it peaked at # 5 in September , behind Zelda II : The Adventure of Link , Super Mario Bros. 2 , Ninja Gaiden , and The Legend of Zelda . The magazine listed it at # 63 in its " 100 Best Games of All Time " list , while Electronic Gaming Monthly listed it at # 184 in its " Top 200 Games of Their Time " list . IGN listed it as # 22 in its " Top 100 NES Games " list . 
 Nintendo Power reviewed the game in its February 1993 issue , as part of an overview of NES games that the magazine felt were overlooked or otherwise did not sell well . The review said that Sunsoft should have used a licensed character to improve sales . However , they praised its graphics and gameplay , saying that " the action switches between side @-@ scrolling stages and stages that have a Zelda @-@ ish view " . Later , in its 100th issue in September 1997 , the game was listed 63rd in its " 100 Best Games of All Time " list , citing its " fast and furious " gameplay .

 At the 1992 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , Sunsoft announced that they were planning to develop a sequel for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System , but it never came to be . Instead , Software Creations developed the North American – exclusive sequel Blaster Master 2 for the Sega Genesis . Later releases include Blaster Master Boy for the Game Boy , Blaster Master : Enemy Below ( released in Japan as <unk> EX ) for the Game Boy Color , and Blaster Master : Blasting Again for the PlayStation . A re @-@ imagining of the first game , Blaster Master : Overdrive , was released for Nintendo 's WiiWare service in North America on February 8 , 2010 ( 2010 @-@ 02 @-@ 08 ) . 
 Scholastic Books published a novelization of Blaster Master , written by Peter Lerangis under the pen name " A.L. Singer " . The book was part of the Worlds of Power series – a collection of loose novelizations of various NES games . He wrote similar novelizations for Ninja Gaiden , Infiltrator , and Bases Loaded II : Second Season . As with the other books in the series , all acts of violence portrayed in the games , including any death scenes , were removed . As a result , the bosses were portrayed in the book as " holographic projections placed over formless blobs " . Shawn Struck and Shawn Sharkey from 1UP.com said that Blaster Master was the hardest book for Lerangis to write because of the lack of a middle plot ; he had to come up with details that were not in the game to connect the game 's actual opening and conclusion . Sunsoft would use Lerangis ' novel as the plot for the game 's sequel , Blaster Master : Blasting Again , making the novel the only one in the Worlds of Power series to be canonized in a video game series . 
 In a 2010 interview with Iwata , he was surprised about the game 's reception outside Japan , which <unk> have named it as one of their favorite and most memorable 8 @-@ bit titles . He said : " It ’ s kind of funny that the first time I ever really had any sense of the game ’ s success was about 10 years following the original release of Blaster Master , when a young staff member from the U.S. office said something to me like , ' You ’ d definitely have become a super famous game designer if you were an American . ' " Alex Neuse , creator of the Bit.Trip series , reminisced his memories of playing Blaster Master as a child . He acknowledged that the game was a clone of Metroid that featured a tank that could jump and a corny storyline , but he said it was all " presented in a way that it felt meaningful " . He added that the game 's music convinced him " that video game music could be high @-@ quality , memorable , and evocative " . 1UP.com listed the game as the 11th best NES game of all time in its " Top 25 NES Games " list ; the 1UP.com staff said the game was " an action game that worked like a mishmash of every NES game before it " , noting the expansive map like in Metroid . Paste magazine ranked Blaster Master as the 2nd greatest NES game of all time , behind The Legend of Zelda ; they cited the tank 's additional abilities as a main reason behind its ranking . 
 On December 15 , 2010 , SOPHIA the 3rd made an appearance in the Flash game Super Mario Bros. Crossover , in its Version 1 @.@ 2 release . In the game , the tank possesses all abilities from Blaster Master and is the first character in the game to have a limited supply of ammunition ; players need to collect power @-@ ups from enemies in order to fire homing missiles , which is necessary to defeat <unk> Beetles , Spike Tops , and Bullet Bills . The version also allows SOPHIA to grapple onto ceilings . On December 21 , 2012 , the game was updated to include , among other skins , a skin that changes the level , enemy , and interface graphics to those based on Blaster Master . According to the game 's designer , SOPHIA was planned to be in the game from the beginning along with Ryu Hayabusa and Luigi , although they were left out of the first release due to time . 
 = = = April Fools ' Day hoax = = = 
 On April Fools ' Day on April 1 , 2010 ( 2010 @-@ 04 @-@ 01 ) , Sunsoft announced that a sequel to the game would be released on the Virtual Console titled Blaster Master : Destination Fred . According to their press release , the game was only purported to be tested on several PlayChoice @-@ 10 machines in the Los Angeles area between 1988 and 1989 . Upon discovery of copies of the game in Sunsoft 's headquarters in Japan , <unk> ' founder Victor Ireland said : " I was blown away when I saw these . When I was going through boxes of stored code , promotional items , and ROMs to see what we had on hand to release for the U.S. Virtual Console market , finding these nine completely unknown cartridges literally stunned me . I knew it had to be put up on the Virtual Console as fast as we could make it happen . " 
 The story was supposed to continue with the English plot of the first Blaster Master game . The Plutonium Boss originally intended to inject Jason and Fred with <unk> that , even if Jason managed to defeat him , would kill both Jason and Fred , but he could only inject Fred . Jason and SOPHIA the 3rd are then shrunken and injected inside Fred to do battle with the <unk> and their contraptions – something which Ireland described as " a pretty clear video game spin on Fantastic Voyage kind of adventure " . It was planned to be released for the Virtual Console on April 26 , 2010 ( 2010 @-@ 04 @-@ 26 ) for 500 Wii points . IGN 's Daemon Hatfield , after discovering nothing about Blaster Master : Destination Fred in any video game archives , suspected that this was an April Fools ' Day hoax ; he said , however , that after the release of Dark Void Zero it was possible for Sunsoft to release a new 8 @-@ bit title . Destructoid 's Conrad Zimmerman strongly suspected that this was also a hoax ; he said that there was no proof of the game 's existence except for it temporarily being mentioned on Wikipedia and that " Nintendo never lets anybody say when their games are coming out on Virtual Console " . Sunsoft later confirmed on their website that the sequel was an April Fools ' Day hoax .

 The team is nicknamed the Belles . Going into the competitions for qualifying for the London 2012 Paralympic Games , the Australian Paralympic Committee was thinking ahead , hoping to build a new , young team that would qualify for the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro . The series of competitions leading up to the London 2012 Paralympic Games were seen as providing valuable training and experience . 
 The first selection process for 2011 – 12 took place in January 2011 , at a camp that was by invitation only . The final 2012 Summer Paralympics team selection announcement was made in May 2012 , and included Jennifer Blow , Meica Christensen , Michelle Rzepecki , Nicole Esdaile , Rachel Henderson and Tyan Taylor .

 = New Jersey Route 168 = 
 Route 168 is a 10 @.@ 75 @-@ mile ( 17 @.@ 30 km ) state highway in the southern part of New Jersey in the United States . The route 's southern terminus is an interchange with Route 42 and the Atlantic City Expressway in the Turnersville section of Washington Township , Gloucester County . The northern terminus is an intersection with County Route 603 ( CR 603 ) on the border of Camden and <unk> in Camden County . At this point , the route continues toward downtown Camden as CR 605 . Route 168 follows the Black Horse Pike for most of its length , running through suburban areas in Gloucester Township , Runnemede , Bellmawr , and Mount Ephraim . It intersects many major roads , including the Route 42 freeway in Gloucester Township , Route 41 in Runnemede , the New Jersey Turnpike and Interstate 295 ( I @-@ 295 ) in Bellmawr , Route 76C ( an access ramp to I @-@ 76 and I @-@ 676 ) in Haddon Township , and U.S. Route 130 ( US 130 ) in Camden . 
 What is now Route 168 runs along the Black Horse Pike , a turnpike established in 1855 that was to run from Camden to Atlantic City . In 1927 , Route 42 was designated along this portion of road as part of its route between Camden and McKee City . In the 1940s , a freeway was proposed for Route 42 between Turnersville and the Camden area ; construction began on this freeway in the 1950s . After this freeway was entirely completed in 1959 , the Route 42 designation was moved to it and the former alignment of Route 42 along the Black Horse Pike north of Turnersville became Route 168 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Route 168 begins at an interchange with the west end of the Atlantic City Expressway , which feeds into Route 42 in the Turnersville section of Washington Township , Gloucester County ; the North – South Freeway begins at that interchange , carrying Route 42 and through traffic from Atlantic City towards Camden . Meanwhile , Route 168 continues on the old Black Horse Pike as a four @-@ lane divided surface road , with the route officially beginning at the intersection with <unk> Lane . Access from Route 168 south to Route 42 is provided via a one @-@ way ramp continuing from the southern terminus of Route 168 . However , northbound traffic from Route 42 must take the ramp to the freeway and exit immediately from the collector / distributor road onto northbound CR 705 to access Route 168 . 
 From here , Route 168 continues north through commercial areas before crossing the Big Timber Creek into Gloucester Township , Camden County , where it becomes a three @-@ lane road with a center left @-@ turn lane and immediately intersects CR 673 , which provides access to Camden County College . The road passes through suburban areas of homes and businesses , coming to a junction with CR 747 . From here , the route heads through the Blackwood section of Gloucester Township , where it intersects CR 534 . The route leaves the Blackwood area and comes to an intersection with CR 706 . The road passes businesses past this intersection as a three @-@ lane road with two southbound lanes and one northbound lane before coming to an interchange with Route 42 . At this interchange , there is full access between northbound Route 42 and Route 168 and between southbound Route 42 and Route 168 . 
 Past the Route 42 interchange , the route intersects CR 676 and narrows to two lanes as it heads through commercial areas of Hilltop . It gains a center left @-@ turn lane again before it crosses over CR 681 and the North Branch of the Big Timber Creek . Route 168 comes to a junction with CR 683 and enters the Glendora section of Gloucester Township , where it heads into residential and commercial areas . Here , the route intersects CR 682 . At the intersection with CR 544 , the road crosses into Runnemede and becomes a two @-@ lane road . Route 168 crosses Route 41 and heads through the center of Runnemede . The center @-@ left turn lane along the route returns before it comes to a ramp for the New Jersey Turnpike on the border of Runnemede and Bellmawr . Past here , Route 168 passes more businesses and crosses CR 659 . A short distance later , the route comes to an interchange with I @-@ 295 , where it becomes a four @-@ lane undivided road . 
 The route forms the border between Mount Ephraim to the west and Haddon Heights to the east past this interchange and intersects CR 654 and CR 658 . At the intersection with the latter , Route 168 entirely enters Mount Ephraim and crosses CR 551 Spur . Past this intersection , the road enters a mix of residential and commercial areas and comes to a junction with CR 660 . Upon crossing Audubon Lake , Route 168 forms the border between Haddon Township to the west and Audubon to the east and becomes a divided highway again with several jughandles . The route crosses CR 635 , where it becomes the border of Haddon Township and Audubon Park as a six @-@ lane divided highway . An interchange with Route 76C provides access to I @-@ 76 , I @-@ 676 , and the Walt Whitman Bridge to and from the southbound direction of Route 168 . 
 Immediately past this interchange , Route 168 narrows to four lanes and intersects CR 650 , crossing the Newton Creek , where it forms the border between Camden to the west and Haddon Township to the east . Here , the route crosses US 130 at a channelized intersection . After crossing over US 130 , Route 168 drops the Black Horse Pike designation and becomes Mount Ephraim Avenue as is runs between the Fairview section of Camden and the West Collingswood Extension section of Haddon Township . Here , the route narrows to a two @-@ lane undivided road and passes through urban areas . It crosses over CR 630 before it becomes a three @-@ lane road with a center left @-@ turn lane and entirely enters Camden . The road crosses the North Branch of the Newton Creek , where it forms the border between Camden to the west and <unk> to the east . It becomes a four @-@ lane undivided road that passes through industrial sectors before crossing a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line and heading past more urban development . Route 168 ends at the intersection with CR 603 , where Mount Ephraim Avenue continues north as CR 605 to downtown Camden , ending at an intersection with CR 561 . 
 = = History = = 
 The predecessor to today 's Route 168 was a set of Lenni Lenape trails that followed the Timber Creek . In 1855 , the Camden and <unk> Turnpike Company was established by entrepreneurs who had helped create the White Horse Pike to build a gravel road that would run from Camden south to Blackwoodtown and eventually to Atlantic City ; this road became the Black Horse Pike . The creation of the Black Horse Pike led to the development of several towns along the route . The Black Horse Pike was transferred from the turnpike company to the county in 1903 , at a time where many private turnpikes would become public roads . In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering , this portion of the Black Horse Pike was designated as part of a new route , Route 42 , that was to run from Ferry Avenue in Camden south to Route 48 ( now US 40 ) in McKee City . This portion of road retained the Route 42 designation in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering . 
 In the late 1940s , a freeway was planned to bypass this portion of Route 42 , with right @-@ of @-@ way acquisition and construction starting in the 1950s . This new freeway , called the North – South Freeway , opened between Bellmawr and the Black Horse Pike in Blackwood in 1958 and from Blackwood to Turnersville in 1959 . With the opening of the freeway , the Route 42 designation was moved to the North – South Freeway and the Black Horse Pike between Turnersville and Camden became Route 168 .

 = William B. Washburn = 
 William Barrett Washburn ( January 31 , 1820 – October 5 , 1887 ) was an American businessman and politician from Massachusetts . Washburn served several terms in the United States House of Representatives ( 1863 – 71 ) and as the 28th Governor of Massachusetts from 1872 to 1874 , when he won election to the United States Senate in a special election to succeed the recently deceased Charles Sumner . A moderate Republican , Washburn only partially supported the Radical Republican agenda during the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed . 
 A Yale graduate , Washburn parlayed early business success in furniture manufacture into banking and railroads , based in the Connecticut River valley town of Greenfield . He was a major proponent of a railroads in northern and western Massachusetts , sitting on the board of the Connecticut River Railroad for many years , and playing an oversight role in the construction of the Hoosac Tunnel . He has been described as a latter @-@ day " Connecticut River God " because of his role as a leading regional businessman and politician . 
 = = Early life = = 
 William Barrett Washburn was born on January 31 , 1820 in Winchendon , Massachusetts , to Asa and Phoebe ( Whitney ) Washburn . His father was a hat maker from a family with deep colonial roots ; Emory Washburn , who was Governor of Massachusetts in 1854 , was a distant cousin . Asa Washburn died in 1823 . 
 Washburn was educated in the academies at Hancock and Westminster , and then attended Yale College , graduating in 1844 . He was a member of the Skull and Bones Society . He was employed as a store clerk from 1844 to 1847 in the business of his uncle in Orange . He established a chair factory in Erving , operating it from 1847 to 1857 and parlaying a $ 10 @,@ 000 ( $ 250 @,@ 000 in 2015 dollars ) investment into a wood products business whose annual production exceeded $ 150 @,@ 000 ( $ 3 @,@ 810 @,@ 000 ) . In 1849 he cofounded the Franklin County Trust Company , on whose board he sat until 1858 . He moved to Greenfield in 1857 , where he was elected president of the Greenfield Bank ( later the First National Bank ) , a post he would hold for the rest of his life . 
 In 1847 , Washburn married Hannah Sweetser of Athol ; the couple had six children , with four surviving to adulthood . 
 = = Political career = = 
 Washburn won election to the Massachusetts Senate in 1850 and served two years in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1853 to 1855 . His elections to the state legislature were supported by proponents of the Hoosac Tunnel . In 1862 Washburn ran for Congress as a Republican , winning election to the 38th Congress against no opposition . He was reelected four times , winning each time by wide margins . He was viewed as relatively moderate , in comparison to the mostly Radical Republican Massachusetts delegation . He served as chairman of the Committee on Claims during the 41st Congress . 
 In 1871 , Washburn ran for Governor of Massachusetts . The Republican Party was then dominant in state politics , and a number of well @-@ known politicians vied for the party nomination to replace outgoing Governor William Claflin . Most prominent was the former Congressman and American Civil War general Benjamin F. Butler , who was disliked by the fiscally conservative state Republican establishment over his support for the continued issuance of greenbacks ( currency not backed by silver or gold ) , and who frequently used populist tactics to upset convention proceedings . Butler 's opponents eventually united behind Washburn to give him the nomination , and he won the general election by a 13 @,@ 000 vote margin over John Quincy Adams II and a labor candidate . He was reelected to further terms in 1872 and 1873 , the former despite dissension in Republican ranks that had resulted in the splitting off of the Liberal Republican Party , who fielded Francis W. Bird . The 1873 convention was particularly affected by the actions of Butler supporters , but Washburn prevailed and was again comfortably reelected . Washburn 's three victories over Butler in these conventions marked a low point in the latter 's career . 
 The major event of 1872 during Washburn 's tenure as governor was the Great Boston Fire of 1872 , which destroyed 65 acres ( 26 ha ) of prime commercial real estate in the city on November 9 . The legislature was called into a special session to enable the provision of state assistance . Measures it passed included a bill simplifying the establishment of insurance companies , since several were bankrupted by the blaze , and a bill authorizing the city to issue bonds to speed the rebuilding effort . 1873 brought a new round of state funding in the amount of $ 200 @,@ 000 to fund the final completion of the Hoosac Tunnel , a tightening of the state 's alcohol prohibition laws , and the establishments of a new prison in Concord ( now MCI Concord ) and a mental hospital in Salem . In 1874 , Washburn signed legislation establishing a women 's reformatory . Although Washburn was a supporter of women 's suffrage , the matter was not seriously considered by the legislature during his term . He also supported legislation reforming the state 's child labor and education laws , which were widely flouted . He opposed enactment of a labor bill limiting work to ten hours per day , a subject of regular labor agitation during his tenure . 
 When United States Senator Charles Sumner died in March 1874 , the state senate , which then chose the state 's US senators , met to choose his replacement . After a long and contentious debate involving thirty @-@ three ballots , Washburn was chosen to succeed Sumner as a compromise candidate acceptable to supporters of Henry L. Dawes and George F. Hoar . Washburn then resigned the governorship , leaving Lieutenant Governor Thomas Talbot as Acting Governor . Washburn served from April 17 , 1874 until the term ended on March 3 , 1875 , and refused to run for reelection . 
 = = Other activities = = 
 Not long after leaving the governorship , Washburn was appointed to a state commission established to investigate the finances and operations of the Hoosac Tunnel , whose construction , originally estimated at $ 2 million ( $ 60 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ) , had instead cost over $ 14 million ( $ 300 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ) and the financing and involvement of the state to complete . This commission filed its report with the legislature in 1875 . 
 Washburn served at various times as a trustee of Yale , the Massachusetts Agricultural College ( now UMass Amherst ) , Amherst College , and Smith College , whose Washburn House he funded . Harvard University conferred a law degree upon him in 1872 . He was a member of a number of missionary societies , which were major beneficiaries of his estate . He was a benefactor of the Greenfield Public Library , funding the construction of its first building and endowing it with funds . 
 Washburn died in Springfield , Massachusetts , on October 5 , 1887 , while attending a session of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions ( <unk> ) , of which he was a member . He was buried in Green River Cemetery in Greenfield .

 = Kylie ( album ) = 
 Kylie is the debut studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue , released by PWL on 4 July 1988 . The album was produced by Stock , Aitken and Waterman , who also wrote nine of the ten tracks on the album . Most of the album 's composition is dance @-@ pop music , with strong bubblegum pop influences . The album contains a few ballads , namely " Je ne sais pas pourquoi " , " It 's No Secret " , " I 'll Still Be Loving You " and " I Miss You " . The main bulk of the album repeated the dance @-@ pop style as seen in " I Should Be So Lucky " and " The Loco @-@ Motion " . 
 The album has received a mixed reception from music critics . Many applauded the album itself , while some did not like another bubblegum pop musician , and critics compared it to American singer and songwriter Madonna 's self @-@ titled album ( 1983 ) . Despite the mixed critical reaction , Kylie was a worldwide success . It peaked at number one in three countries , including the United Kingdom , New Zealand and Japan , and it produced three number one singles in Australia . In North America , the album peaked low on the Billboard charts , yet still managed to sell over 500 @,@ 000 copies and was certified gold . In Australia , the album was re @-@ issued as The Kylie Collection also in 1988 , as well as a VHS video in Australia and featuring bonus remixes . Kylie was certified seven times platinum in the UK and has sold over 7 million copies worldwide . 
 Kylie had a total of six singles released from the album worldwide . Her debut single was a cover of the Little Eva single " The Loco @-@ Motion " , written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King , which charted worldwide and went to number one in a total of eight countries , and peaked in the top ten of twenty countries , becoming one of Minogue 's most successful singles to date . The follow up single was " I Should Be So Lucky " , which went to number one in seven countries , including Australia and the United Kingdom , and peaked at number twenty @-@ eight on the US Billboard charts .

 In 1979 , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old Kylie Minogue was established as a child actress , appearing as a cameo actress in the TV series The Sullivans and Skyways . Both Minogue and her sister Dannii Minogue were both child stars trying to achieve success in the TV industry of Australia , but Dannii received better opportunities as a TV actress than Kylie . At the time , Kylie became jealous of Dannii 's new found success in Australia . In 1985 , Kylie was cast as one of the lead roles on TV soap The Henderson Kids but her role only lasted one season , and was completed after two seasons . Interested in following a career in music , she made a demo tape for the producers of the weekly music programme Young Talent Time , which featured Dannii as a regular performer . Kylie gave her first television singing performance on the show in 1985 but was not invited to join the cast . Dannii 's success overshadowed Kylie 's acting achievements , until Kylie was cast in the soap opera Neighbours in 1986 , as Charlene Mitchell , a schoolgirl turned garage mechanic . Neighbours achieved popularity in the UK , and a story arc that created a romance between her character and the character played by Jason Donovan , culminated in a wedding episode in 1987 that attracted an audience of 20 million British viewers . 
 In 1987 , during a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert , the other cast members of Neighbours put on their own talent stage show . Minogue had not prepared anything so she got up on stage and performed a cover version of " Loco @-@ Motion " - she was then immediately signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records . The song was released as a single in Australia , and became the highest @-@ selling single of the 1980s . Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to London with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with Stock , Aitken and Waterman . They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving ; as a result , they wrote " I Should Be So Lucky " while she waited outside the studio . Minogue recorded the song in less than an hour , and returned home to Australia to work on Neighbours . The song became a huge chart success , and Mike Stock travelled to Melbourne to apologize to Minogue for forgetting about her previous recording session . While Stock was there , Kylie recorded her next single , " Got to Be Certain " along with album track , and the Japan @-@ only single release , " Turn It into Love " , and Stock successfully convinced Minogue to return to London in the beginning of 1988 to record songs for her debut album . 
 = = Development = = 
 Minogue was eventually signed to Mushroom Records in early 1987 . The first song that Minogue had ever considered to record was the successful " The Loco @-@ Motion " , which she instantly fell in love with when she first heard it . When she performed for a fundraiser in Australia , she performed Sonny & Cher 's song " I Got You Babe " . Alan Hardy , who asked Minogue to perform at the fundraiser , noticed that she was very nervous in performing . However , the crowd were <unk> of her performance . Hardy later asked if she would do another and , to her surprise , she performed " The Loco @-@ Motion " , already rehearsing the song before the performance . Minogue went to record the song in Melbourne but could not record the song in the same key as the backing track , so she went to improve her vocals so she could change her pitch to a E minor . 
 After the success of her debut single " Locomotion " in Australia , Minogue traveled to London to work with Stock Aitken Waterman , a successful British writing and production team . They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving ; as a result , they wrote " I Should Be So Lucky " in forty minutes while she waited outside the recording studio . Mike Stock wrote the lyrics for the song in response to what he had learned about Minogue prior to her arrival . He believed that although she was a successful soap star in Australia , attractive and very talented , there had to be something wrong with her and figured that she must be unlucky in love . Minogue recorded the song in less than an hour , which Stock attributes to her good ear for music and her quick memorization skills . After Minogue finished the recording session she returned home to Australia to continue work on the soap opera , Neighbours . After hearing the song , Waterman said " I thought it was fantastic , so I ran over to the DJ and asked him what it was . He said ' Its Kylie Minogue - I Should Be So Lucky ' . " He later said to Mike Stock that the song would be an instant smash hit .
