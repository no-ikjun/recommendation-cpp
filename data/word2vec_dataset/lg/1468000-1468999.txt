 After Peter Burke ( Tim DeKay ) leaves a scanner at home , Elizabeth overhears plans for a robbery . Peter visits the scene of the alleged crime , but finds nothing to suggest that the robbery exists . Neal and Peter attribute Elizabeth ’ s actions to paranoia stemming from her recent kidnapping by Matthew Keller . However , Mozzie believes that the robbery was real , and begins helping Elizabeth monitor Peter ’ s scanner . Mozzie and Elizabeth soon hear the same voices from the original transmission , and discover that they are the voices of the Burke ’ s new neighbors , Ben ( Manganiello ) and Rebecca Ryan ( Lola Glaudini ) . Elizabeth immediately visits their house , coercing an invitation for dinner that night . While at dinner , Elizabeth excuses herself from the table in order to search the house . She discovers nothing , but soon finds herself locked in a bedroom . Neal , speaking to her through a window , walks her through picking the lock . However , she is soon found by an annoyed Peter . 
 Peter finally agrees to investigate the Ryans , quickly being informed by Diana Berrigan ( Marsha Thomason ) that Ben has an armed robbery conviction . As Peter phones Elizabeth to let her know that she was correct , Ben visits the Burke home and vaguely threatens Elizabeth . Clinton Jones ( Sharif Atkins ) follows Ben and discovers the identity of Ben ’ s partner : Connor Bailey ( Will Chase ) . In order to get closer to the suspects , Neal visits Ben ’ s parole office under the alias Nick Halden . Using information gathered by Neal , Peter quickly realizes that the target of the heist is a luxury hotel . Peter and Neal hurry to the hotel , barely missing Ben and Connor . At the Burke home , Elizabeth and Mozzie follow Rebecca as she leaves the house . Realizing that Peter will not reach them in time , Elizabeth approaches the Ryans as an FBI agent . Her attempt fails just as Peter and the FBI arrive .

 Pavo is a constellation in the southern sky with the Latin name for peacock .

Pavo first appeared on a 35 @-@ cm ( 14 in ) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer 's star atlas Uranometria of 1603 . French explorer and astronomer Nicolas @-@ Louis de Lacaille gave its stars Bayer designations in 1756 . The constellations Pavo , Grus , Phoenix and Tucana are collectively known as the " Southern Birds " .

 Pavo was one of the twelve constellations established by Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius from the observations of the southern sky by Dutch explorers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman , who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition , known as the Eerste Schipvaart , to the East Indies . It first appeared on a 35 @-@ cm ( 14 in ) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius . 
 The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in German cartographer Johann Bayer 's Uranometria of 1603 . De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name De <unk> , " The Peacock " . 
 Pavo and the nearby constellations Phoenix , Grus and Tucana are collectively called the " Southern Birds " . 
 An alternate Latin name for the constellation was <unk> Avis . 
 = = = The peacock in Greek mythology = = = 
 According to Mark Chartrand , former executive director of the National Space Institute , Plancius may not have been the first to designate this group of stars as a peacock : " In Greek myth the stars that are now the Peacock were Argos [ or Argus ] , builder of the ship Argo . He was changed by the goddess Juno into a peacock and placed in the sky along with his ship . " Indeed , the peacock " <unk> [ ed ] the starry firmament " for the Greeks , and the goddess Hera was believed to drive through the heavens in a chariot drawn by peacocks . 
 The peacock and the " Argus " nomenclature are also prominent in a different myth , in which Io , a beautiful princess of Argos , was lusted after by Zeus ( Jupiter ) . Zeus changed Io into a heifer to deceive his wife ( and sister ) Hera and couple with her . Hera saw through Zeus 's scheme and asked for the heifer as a gift . Zeus , unable to refuse such a reasonable request , reluctantly gave the heifer to Hera , who promptly banished Io and arranged for Argus Panoptes , a creature with one hundred eyes , to guard the now @-@ pregnant Io from Zeus . Meanwhile , Zeus entreated Hermes to save Io ; Hermes used music to lull Argus Panoptes to sleep , then slew him . Hera adorned the tail of a peacock — her favorite bird — with Argus 's eyes in his honor . 
 As recounted in Ovid 's Metamorphoses , the death of Argus Panoptes also contains an explicit celestial reference : " Argus lay dead ; so many eyes , so bright quenched , and all hundred shrouded in one night . <unk> [ Hera ] retrieved those eyes to set in place among the feathers of her bird [ the peacock , Pavo ] and filled his tail with starry jewels . " 
 It is uncertain whether the Dutch astronomers had the Greek mythos in mind when creating Pavo but , in keeping with other constellations introduced by Plancius through Keyser and De <unk> , the " peacock " in the new constellation likely referred to the green peacock , which the explorers would have encountered in the East Indies , rather than the blue peacock known to the ancient Greeks .

The three @-@ letter abbreviation for the constellation , as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922 , is " <unk> " . The official constellation boundaries , as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930 , are defined by a polygon of 10 segments .

 = Ansgar Løvold = 
 Ansgar Løvold ( 19 November 1888 – 12 November 1961 ) was a wrestler , butcher and philanthropist from Kristiansund , Norway . He is most known for participating at the 1912 Summer Olympics and for launching the idea for the Kristiansund and Frei Fixed Link . 
 Løvold started wrestling during his journeyman years while living in Oslo . He joined IF Ørnulf and became Norwegian Champion in Greco @-@ Roman wrestling in 1912 . This qualified him to the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm , but Løvold lost both his matches in the light heavyweight event . He moved back to Kristiansund in 1913 , where he founded a wrestling club and started as an instructor . He also founded wrestling clubs in Molde and Trondheim . As a butcher , he ran several butcher shops in town . From 1951 , Løvold dedicated his time to working towards a fixed link for Kristiansund . 
 = = Early life and professional career = = 
 Løvold was born on 19 November 1888 in Kristiansund , Norway , as son of Missionary Ole Løvold ( 1846 – 1919 ) . Løvold started as a butcher apprentice with his brother B. O. Løvold , before setting out on his journeyman years , where he worked at Bye in Bergen and Axel Jensen in Oslo . He received his trade certificate in 1910 . He moved back to Kristiansund in 1913 , where he lived for the rest of his life . He married <unk> , who died in 1958 . 
 Løvold established a butcher shop in <unk> in 1914 , which he ran until it was taken over by the municipality in 1917 . He then operated various retailing businesses until joining Nordmøre <unk> . There he was chief of operations until the slaughtering company closed in 1932 . He then established Ansgar <unk> og <unk> , which at first was located at <unk> <unk> <unk> two years moved to <unk> . His store was destroyed in the bombings of the Norwegian Campaign during World War II , although rebuilt after the war . After he retired , the store was taken over by his sons . 
 = = Sports career = = 
 It was during the journeyman years in Oslo that Løvold joined organized wrestling . Wrestling in Kristiansund was first introduced by Løvold wrestling at circuses and town fairs . On 8 January 1911 he held a major show against circus artist Erik <unk> , for which Løvold was promised 100 Norwegian krone ( NOK ) if he won . Although successful , he did not accept the prize money , as it would have made him a professional . He started competing for <unk> TIF and later IF Ørnulf in Oslo . He represented the latter when he won the 1912 Norwegian championships , thus qualifying him for the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm . There he participated in the Greco @-@ Roman light heavyweight , but was sent home after losing both his introductory rounds , against Finland 's Karl Lind and Austria 's Karl <unk> . 
 After moving home to Kristiansund in 1913 , Løvold was instrumental in establishing a wrestling club . The sport became popular and within a few years all the major sports clubs were offering wrestling . Especially the labor movement 's clubs took up the sport , and Kristiansund was quickly known as a wrestling town . Løvold coached several clubs , including IL Nordlandet and <unk> . In 1913 he succeeded at getting sponsorships of NOK 300 from various companies throughout town to purchase mats , which was instrumental in making the sport more popular in town . He later became known as a benefactor and sponsor of local wrestling . Kristiansund 's first major national tournament was held in 1915 and the first Norwegian Championships in Kristiansund were held in 1922 . Løvold also traveled to the neighboring town of Molde to establish a wrestling club there , although wrestling never became as popular in Molde as in Kristiansund . He also established Trondheim 's first wrestling club . From 1939 , when the labourers ' wrestling clubs in Kristiansund merged to form the club Kristiansund AK , Løvold represented this club . 
 = = Philanthropy = = 
 Løvold was an active member of Foreningen <unk> , an organization which worked for the betterment of the town . After seeing The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen , Løvold started working to build a mermaid statue fountain in Kristiansund . The mermaid statue was never built , although he eventually secured sufficient funding to build a fountain . Løvold traveled to the United States in 1951 to visit his siblings Oscar and Lise in Minnesota , which he had not seen in 42 years . He also visited New York City , where he drove through the Holland Tunnel . On his way home he came in contact with Prime Minister Oscar Torp . 
 Back in Kristiansund , Løvold started working with the idea of building a subsea road tunnel from Kristiansund to the mainland . He discussed the issue in Foreningen <unk> where it received support . Løvold was an important enthusiast for the fixed link project , which would materialize as the Kristiansund and Frei Fixed Link in 1992 . The local press dubbed him the fixed link general . In 1955 he organized an inspection of <unk> ; using echo sounding it was possible to survey the depth of the fjord . Afterwards he took contact with County Governor Olav <unk> and the two started working towards implementing the plans . 
 Along with Engineer Gunnar <unk> , Løvold traveled several times to Oslo to meet with national politicians and authorities . In addition to Torp , he consulted the engineering company Aas @-@ Jakobsen , the NATO office and <unk> <unk> , Minister of Transport and Communications . In 1958 a joint municipal and county committee was established to follow up the plans , where Løvold was appointed chairman . Its main function was the ordering seismic surveys of <unk> , which gave positive results . Major Worm Eide manned for caution and stated that there was no funding available . Subsequently a committee led by Ole <unk> was appointed , which criticized the original committee for not prioritizing more critical transport investments . 
 During the entire planning and construction of the Tromsø Bridge , Løvold subscribed to both the Tromsø newspapers , Nordlys and Bladet Tromsø , to follow the development . Erling <unk> , who was the main initiator of the Tromsø Bridge , was an inspiration for Løvold . Following in the steps of Tromsø , Løvold established <unk> ( " The Tunnel Association " ) . Its prime goal was to circulate a petition , which received 6 @,@ 000 signatures — two thirds of the electorate . The organization also featured paroles in the 1961 Constitution Day parade . During the summer , Løvold painted a large , while " tunnel entrance " on a cliff at <unk> as a public relations gimmick . The point he painted was the exact location the <unk> Tunnel would have its opening . Another organization , <unk> ( " The Mainland Association " ) was established by Løvold on 27 September 1961 . That year another public committee was established , again chaired by Løvold . Løvold died on 12 November 1961 in Kristiansund , 72 years old . 
 = Bikernieki Memorial = 
 Bikernieki Memorial ( Latvian : Biķernieku <unk> ) is a war memorial to The Holocaust victims of World War II in Bikernieki forest ( Latvian : Biķernieku <unk> ) , near Riga , Latvia . Bikernieki forest is the biggest mass murder site during The Holocaust in Latvia with two memorial territories spanning over 80 @,@ 000 square metres ( 860 @,@ 000 sq ft ) with 55 marked burial sites with around 20 @,@ 000 victims still buried in total . 
 The memorial was initially planned and construction started in 1986 , but was delayed after Latvia declared independence in 1991 . The construction was revived in 2000 by German War Graves Commission with the help of local Latvian organisations and several German cities . It was financed mostly by German government and organisations , Austrian State Fund , and involved city donations . It was designed by Sergey Rizh and opened on November 30 , 2001 . 
 = = Description = = 
 The architect of the memorial is Sergey Rizh ( Russian : Серге ́ й <unk> ) , who worked for 15 years on the design of the memorial , saying it was " his human obligation " to devote his career to this . The memorial is located in the Bikernieki forest , next to the <unk> Street ( Latvian : Biķernieku <unk> ) passing through the forest . There are two memorial territories – 6 @,@ 550 and 79 @,@ 630 square metres ( 70 @,@ 500 and 857 @,@ 100 sq ft ) wide on both sides from the road . In addition to smaller forest pathways , there are two roads leading to the memorial 's central square – a historic road used to bring the victims and the main central road paved with concrete slabs and marked with a concrete arc exiting to <unk> Street . 
 The centre of assembly houses a black granite cube – a symbolic altar with engraving from Book of Job 16 : 18 " Earth , don 't cover my blood . Let my cry have no place to rest . " in Latvian , Russian , German , and Hebrew languages . The immediate area is surrounded by 4 @,@ 000 granite stones arranged in a grid of forty @-@ five 4 @-@ by @-@ 4 @-@ metre ( 13 ft × 13 ft ) squares , and resembles a traditional Jewish cemetery . The unique rough @-@ hewn 0 @.@ 2 @-@ to @-@ 1 @.@ 5 @-@ metre ( 0 @.@ 66 to 4 @.@ 92 ft ) high granite stones of black , gray , and reddish colors come from Zhytomyr region in Ukraine . The stones are carved with European city names representing the home towns of the victims . The entrances to the memorial and other grave sites in the forest are marked with concrete pillars with symbols representing various groups of the fallen – Star of David representing Jews , Crown of Thorns representing war prisoners , and Christian cross representing civilians . Historians from the New Synagogue Berlin – Centrum <unk> , educational establishment House of the Wannsee Conference , and historians from the member cities have documented the names of over 31 @,@ 000 victims , published in Book of Remembrance : The German , Austrian and Czechoslovakian Jews deported to the Baltic States ( 2003 ) . 
 Despite the nature of memorial , the surrounding hills are a popular summer hiking and winter sledding and skiing location . Although Germany supplies annual funding for memorial maintenance , it is insufficient to fund regular police patrols and surveillance . The memorial and gravestones have been vandalised several times , each time attracting media attention .

 Bikernieki forest is Latvia 's biggest mass murder site during The Holocaust of World War II during years 1941 – 44 . There are 55 marked mass burial sites in the forest . About 46 @,@ 500 people were reported to have been killed there , including Latvian and Western European Jews , Soviet prisoners of war , and Nazis ' political adversaries . The exact number of victims is unknown . Although Soviet Nazi War Crime Research Committee declared over 46 @,@ 000 murders , later excavations did not confirm this number . The number of victims is speculated to be closer to 30 @,@ 000 . 
 The first victims were a few thousand men arrested in July 1941 and brought from Riga Central Prison . In 1942 another 12 @,@ 000 Jews were brought from Germany , Austria , and Czechoslovakia . In 1943 Riga Ghetto prisoners were brought here who were unable to work at <unk> concentration camp , followed by those from the camp itself unable to work in 1944 . In 1943 and onwards Nazis dug up graves and burned the bodies to hide the evidence . It is estimated that there are now around 20 @,@ 000 victims buried in the forest . 
 = = Planning and construction = = 
 In the 1960s , only a simple commemorative plaque was placed in the forest and the grave sites were marked with concrete borders . The plaque stated that 46 @,@ 500 Soviet citizens had died and omitted mentioning nationalities . The location had been neglected and slowly degrading since . The first plans for the Bikernieki forest grave site cleanup were formed in 1986 by a team from the <unk> Institute . The team included <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> Alsina , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Sergey Rizh in the lead . The project received Riga City Council 's approval and state funding and the works continued until 1991 when the current government was dissolved after Latvia declared independence . The work halted at around a fifth of the completion with only the surrounding terrain cleared and central and entrance memorial signs erected . 
 The project was revived in 1993 – 4 by the initiative of Eric Herzl , an expert from Austrian Society of Memorials , who obtained the permission from Riga City Council to continue the construction work . Austria brought the project to the attention of the German War Graves Commission and more than a dozen German cities in 1999 . On May 23 , 2000 , 13 German city representatives and the president of German War Graves Commission met in Berlin to form German Riga Committee . [ a ] The chapter was formed to plan and build a war memorial in Bikernieki forest to commemorate the Jews deported and killed at the start of the 1940s . The project was funded by German War Graves Commission , the National Fund of the Republic of Austria , the German government including Central Council of Jews in Germany , and donations from several German town municipalities . The work was carried out by The German Commission , Latvian Fraternal Cemeteries Commission , and the Riga City Council . The projected cost was DEM 900 @,@ 000 and the actual project cost DEM 1M ( or <unk> 285 @,@ 000 ) . 
 The memorial was opened on November 30 , 2001 , 60 years after the start of the deportations . The event was opened by the former president of Latvia Vaira Vīķe @-@ Freiberga who in her speech noted the importance of raising people 's awareness about the events that took place there . The event was well attended , including former Latvian Prime Minister <unk> <unk> , Latvian chief rabbi <unk> <unk> , officials and ambassadors from various countries , former ghetto and concentration camp inmates , and relatives of the victims from Lithuania , Estonia , Germany , Israel , Austria , and Russia . Several research , education , and remembrance events were held after the opening ceremony . The opening and the following events received local and foreign media coverage . The opening ceremony ended with a Jewish prayer Kaddish by Riga Jewish community cantor Vlad Shulman .

 The architect Sergey Rizh says he attempted to show the idea of the memorial with a " concise language of architectural forms " . His goal was to encompass the surrounding terrain in line with contemporary art . Art historian <unk> <unk> called the project successful and lauded the design for avoiding exaggeration of themes at hand . She also noted that the memorial fit well with the terrain . Architect <unk> <unk> also said the project was successful among many other less successful ones . She stressed its positive nature and how the memorial " reconciles with the pain , and evens it out . " Winfried <unk> describes it as the " first of its kind in Eastern Europe " .

He represented California 's 11th congressional district from 1973 until he was shot to death in Guyana by members of the Peoples Temple , shortly before the Jonestown mass suicide on November 18 , 1978 , just 11 days after Ryan 's election to a fourth term . He is the only sitting member of the U.S. House of Representatives to have been assassinated in office . 
 After the Watts Riots of 1965 , Assemblyman Ryan took a job as a substitute school teacher to investigate and document conditions in the area . In 1970 , he investigated the conditions of California prisons by being held , under a pseudonym , as an inmate in Folsom Prison , while presiding as chairman of the Assembly committee that oversaw prison reform . During his time in Congress , Ryan traveled to Newfoundland to investigate the practice of seal hunting . 
 Ryan was also famous for vocal criticism of the lack of Congressional oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , and authored the Hughes – Ryan Amendment , passed in 1974 . He was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal posthumously in 1983 .

 Ryan was born in Lincoln , Nebraska . Throughout his early life , his family moved frequently through Illinois , Florida , New York , Wisconsin , and Massachusetts . He graduated from Campion Jesuit High School in Prairie du Chien , Wisconsin , in 1943 . He then received V @-@ 12 officer training at Bates College and served with the United States Navy from 1943 to 1946 as a submariner . 
 Ryan graduated from Nebraska 's Creighton University with a B.A. in 1949 and an M.S. in 1951 . He served as a teacher , school administrator and South San Francisco city councilman from 1956 to 1962 . He taught English at <unk> High School , and chaperoned the marching band in 1961 to Washington , D.C. , to participate in President John F. Kennedy 's inaugural parade . Ryan was inspired by Kennedy 's call to service in his inaugural address , and decided to run for higher office .

 In 1962 , Ryan was elected mayor of South San Francisco . He served less than a year as mayor , before taking a seat in the California State Assembly 's 27th district , winning his assembly race by a margin of 20 @,@ 000 votes . He had previously run for the State Assembly 's 25th district in 1958 , but lost to Republican Louis Francis . Ryan served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1964 and 1968 , and he held his Assembly seat through 1972 , when he was elected to the United States House of Representatives . He was successively elected three more times to the United States Congress . 
 U.S. Congresswoman and former California State Senator and Ryan aide Jackie Speier described Ryan 's style of investigation as " experiential legislating " . After the Watts Riots of 1965 , Assemblyman Ryan went to the area and took a job as a substitute school teacher to investigate and document conditions in the area . In 1970 , using a pseudonym , Ryan had himself arrested , detained , and strip searched to investigate conditions in the California prison system . He stayed as an inmate for ten days in the Folsom Prison , while presiding as chairman on the Assembly committee that oversaw prison reform . 
 As a California Assemblyman , Ryan also served as the Chairman of legislative subcommittee hearings and presided over hearings involving his later successor as Congressman , Tom Lantos . Ryan pushed through important educational policies in California and authored what came to be known as the Ryan Act , which established an independent regulatory commission to monitor educational credentialing in the state .

 During his time in Congress , Ryan went to Newfoundland with James Jeffords to investigate the inhumane killing of seals , and he was famous for vocal criticism of the lack of Congressional oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , authoring the Hughes – Ryan Amendment , which would have required extensive CIA notification of Congress about planned covert operations . Congressman Ryan once told Dick Cheney that leaking a state secret was an appropriate way for a member of Congress to block an " ill @-@ conceived operation " . Ryan supported Patricia Hearst , and along with Senator S. I. Hayakawa , delivered Hearst 's application for a presidential commutation to the Pardon Attorney . 
 = = Peoples Temple = = 
 In 1978 , reports regarding widespread abuse and human rights violations in Jonestown among the Peoples Temple , led by cult leader Jim Jones , began to filter out of the organization 's Guyana enclaves . Ryan was friends with the father of former Temple Member Bob Houston , whose mutilated body was found near train tracks on October 5 , 1976 , three days after a taped telephone conversation with Houston 's ex @-@ wife in which leaving the Temple was discussed . Ryan 's interest was further aroused by the custody battle between the leader of a " Concerned Relatives " group , Timothy Stoen , and Jones following a Congressional " white paper " written by Stoen detailing the events . Ryan was one of 91 Congressmen to write Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham on Stoen 's behalf . 
 Later , after reading an article in the San Francisco Examiner , Ryan declared his intention to go to Jonestown , an agricultural commune in Guyana where Jim Jones and roughly 1 @,@ 000 Temple members resided . Ryan 's choice was also influenced both by the Concerned Relatives group , which consisted primarily of Californians , as were most Temple members , and by his own characteristic distaste for social injustice . According to the San Francisco Chronicle , while investigating the events , the United States Department of State " repeatedly stonewalled Ryan 's attempts to find out what was going on in Jonestown " , and told him that " everything was fine " . The State Department characterized possible action by the United States government in Guyana against Jonestown as creating a potential " legal controversy " , but Ryan at least partially rejected this viewpoint . In a later article in The Chronicle , Ryan was described as having " bucked the local Democratic establishment and the Jimmy Carter administration 's State Department " in order to prepare for his own investigation . 
 = = = Travels to Jonestown = = = 
 On November 1 , 1978 , Ryan announced that he would visit Jonestown . He did so as part of a government investigation and received permission and government funds to do so . He made the journey in his role as chairman of a congressional subcommittee with jurisdiction over U.S. citizens living in foreign countries . He asked the other members of his Bay Area congressional delegation to join him on the investigation to Jonestown , but they all declined his invitation . Ryan had also asked his friend , Indiana Congressman and future Vice President Dan Quayle , to accompany him – Quayle had served with Ryan on the Government Operations Committee – but Quayle was unable to go on the trip . 
 While the party was initially planned to consist of only a few members of the Congressman 's staff and press as part of the congressional delegation , once the media learned of the trip the entourage ballooned to include , among others , concerned relatives of Temple members . Congressman Ryan traveled to Jonestown with 17 Bay Area relatives of Peoples Temple members , several newspaper reporters and an NBC TV team . When the legal counsel for Jones attempted to impose several restrictive conditions on the visit , Ryan responded that he would be traveling to Jonestown whether Jones permitted it or not . Ryan 's stated position was that a " settlement deep in the bush might be reasonably run on authoritarian lines " . However , residents of the settlement must be allowed to come and go as they pleased . He further asserted that if the situation had become " a gulag " , he would do everything he could to " free the captives " .

 On November 14 , according to the Foreign Affairs Committee report , Ryan left Washington and arrived in Georgetown , the capital of Guyana located 150 miles ( 240 km ) away from Jonestown , with his congressional delegation of government officials , media representatives and some members of the " Concerned Relatives " . 
 That night the delegation stayed at a local hotel where , despite confirmed reservations , most of the rooms had been canceled and reassigned , leaving the delegation sleeping in the lobby . For three days , Ryan continued negotiation with Jones 's legal counsel and held perfunctory meetings with embassy personnel and Guyanese officials . 
 While in Georgetown , Ryan visited the Temple 's Georgetown headquarters in the suburb of <unk> Gardens . Ryan asked to speak to Jones by radio , but Sharon Amos , the highest @-@ ranking Temple member present , told Ryan that he could not because his present visit was unscheduled . On November 17 , Ryan 's aide Jackie Speier ( who became a Congresswoman in April 2008 ) , the United States embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Richard Dwyer , a Guyanese Ministry of Information officer , nine journalists , and four Concerned Relatives representatives of the delegation boarded a small plane for the flight to an airfield at Port Kaituma a few miles outside of Jonestown . At first , only the Temple legal counsel was allowed off the plane , but eventually the entire entourage ( including Gordon Lindsay , reporting for NBC ) was allowed in . Initially , the welcome at Jonestown was warm , but Temple member Vernon Gosney handed a note to NBC correspondent Don Harris which stated , " Please help me get out of Jonestown , " listing himself and Temple member Monica Bagby . That night , the media and the delegation were returned to the airfield for accommodations following Jones ' refusal to allow them to stay the night ; the rest of the group remained . The next morning , Ryan , Speier , and Dwyer all continued their interviews , and in the morning met a woman who secretly expressed her wish to leave Jonestown with her family and another family . Around 11 : 00 A.M. local time , the media and the delegation returned and took part in interviewing Peoples Temple members . Around 3 : 00 p.m. , 14 Temple defectors , and Larry Layton posing as a defector , boarded a truck and were taken to the airstrip , with Ryan wishing to stay another night to assist any others that wished to leave . Shortly thereafter , a failed knife attack on Congressman Ryan occurred while he was arbitrating a family dispute on leaving . Against Ryan 's protests , Deputy Chief of Mission Dwyer ordered Ryan to leave , but he promised to return later to address the dispute . 
 The entire group left Jonestown and arrived at the Kaituma airstrip by 4 : 45 p.m. local time . Their exit transport planes , a twin @-@ engine Otter and a Cessna , did not arrive until 5 : 10 p.m. The smaller six @-@ seat Cessna was just taxiing to the end of the runway when one of its occupants , Larry Layton , opened fire on those inside , wounding several . Concurrently , several other Peoples Temple members who had escorted the group out began to open fire on the transport plane , killing Congressman Ryan , three journalists and a defecting Temple member , while wounding nine others , including Speier . The gunmen riddled Congressman Ryan 's body with bullets before shooting him in the face . The passengers on the Cessna subdued Larry Layton and the surviving people on both planes fled into nearby fields during and after the attack . 
 That afternoon , before the news became public , the wife of Ryan 's aide , William Holsinger , received three threatening phone calls . The caller allegedly stated , " Tell your husband that his meal ticket just had his brains blown out , and he better be careful . " The <unk> then fled to Lake Tahoe and later to a ranch in Houston . They never returned to San Francisco . Following its takeoff , the Cessna radioed in a report of the attack , and the U.S. Ambassador , John R. Burke , went to the residence of Prime Minister Forbes Burnham . It was not until the next morning that the Guyanese army could cut through the jungle and reach the settlement . They discovered 909 of its inhabitants dead ; the individuals died in what the United States House of Representatives described as a " mass suicide / murder ritual " .

 Larry Layton , brother of author and former Peoples Temple member Deborah Layton , was convicted in 1986 of conspiracy in the murder of Leo Ryan . Temple defectors boarding the truck to Port Kaituma warned about Larry Layton that " there 's no way he 's a defector . He 's too close to Jones . " Layton was the only former Peoples Temple member to be tried in the United States for criminal acts relating to the murders at Jonestown . He was convicted on four different murder @-@ related counts . 
 On March 3 , 1987 , Layton was sentenced to concurrent sentences of life in prison for " aiding and abetting the murder of Congressman Leo Ryan " , " conspiracy to murder an internationally protected person , Richard Dwyer , Deputy Chief of Mission for the United States in the Republic of Guyana " , as well as fifteen years in prison on other related counts . At that time , he was eligible for parole in five years . On June 3 , 1987 , Layton 's motion to set aside the conviction " on the ground that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel during his second trial " was denied by the United States District Court of the Northern District of California . After spending eighteen years in prison , Layton was released from custody in April 2002 .

 = Jack Faber = 
 John Edgar Faber , Jr . ( January 13 , 1903 – January 14 , 1994 ) was an American microbiologist and college football and lacrosse coach at the University of Maryland . Faber served as the Maryland lacrosse coach from 1928 to 1963 , during which time he compiled a 249 – 57 record and secured numerous national and conference championships . Faber was inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1963 . He coached the Maryland football team in 1935 and again , as a co @-@ head coach alongside Al Heagy and Al Woods , from 1940 to 1941 . He compiled a 12 – 13 – 4 record in football . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Faber was born in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania on January 13 , 1903 , and attended Central High School in Washington , D.C. He then went on to college at the University of Maryland , where he played on the Maryland lacrosse team , earning letters in 1926 and 1927 , and the basketball team , earning letters from 1924 to 1927 . The United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association ( USILA ) named Faber an honorable mention All @-@ American as an inside attackman in 1926 and a third @-@ team All @-@ American at the out home position in 1927 . 
 = = Professional career = = 
 From the University of Maryland , Faber earned a B.S. in 1926 , a M.S. in 1928 , and a Ph.D. in bacteriology in 1937 . In 1945 , he was appointed the head of his alma mater 's Department of Microbiology , a position he held for 18 years . During World War II , Faber joined the United States Army and served from 1942 to 1946 , attaining the rank of major . He spent three years working at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington , D.C. 
 While teaching bacteriology at Maryland , Faber also held coaching duties . He served as the head coach for the Maryland lacrosse team from 1928 to 1963 . During his tenure , Faber 's lacrosse teams compiled a 249 – 57 record and secured eight outright or shared USILA national championships and nine Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) championships . From 1930 onward , Faber shared coaching duties with Albert Heagy , with the former running the offense and the latter the defense . In 1936 , Faber led Maryland to capture the first Wingate Memorial Trophy , the national championship bestowed by the USILA . The following year , they shared the title with Princeton . In the inaugural North @-@ South Senior All @-@ Star Game in 1940 , Faber coached the South team , which lost to the North team coached by Princeton 's William F. Logan , 6 – 5 . He also coached all @-@ star teams in 1946 and 1956 . In 1955 and 1956 , Faber led Maryland to back @-@ to @-@ back 11 – 0 seasons , with the only close matches coming against period powerhouse Navy , in 1955 , and the highly successful Mount Washington Lacrosse Club , 12 – 11 in 1956 . In 1959 , Maryland finished with a 10 – 1 mark as USILA co @-@ champions alongside Army and Johns Hopkins , and Faber was named the USILA Coach of the Year . 
 Faber also served on the football staff . He became the assistant field coach under Curly Byrd in 1933 . Byrd was able to devote less time to the team because of his duties as university vice president . In 1930 , Faber enticed <unk> Berger , Maryland 's first basketball All @-@ American , to join the football team with the promise of free late night dining hall meals . In 1935 , Faber took over as head coach when Byrd was promoted to university president . Faber continued to employ his predecessor 's pass @-@ oriented " Byrd system " and hired Richmond head coach Frank Dobson as an assistant . Despite facing " an almost suicidal schedule " , Faber 's veteran team led by back Bill <unk> compiled a 7 – 2 – 2 record to finish in third place in the Southern Conference . Faber was succeeded as head football coach by Dobson in 1936 , but in turn , replaced him as a co @-@ head coach alongside Al Heagy and Al Woods in 1940 and 1941 . Those teams finished with 2 – 6 – 1 and 3 – 5 – 1 records , respectively , to bring Faber 's combined football coaching record to 12 – 13 – 4 . The coaching trio was subsequently replaced by Clark Shaughnessy , who two seasons prior had orchestrated a remarkable one @-@ year turnaround at Stanford using a revolutionary version of the T formation . Faber also spent time as an assistant basketball coach at Maryland , and in 1932 , filled in for head coach Burton Shipley who had fallen ill . Faber served two terms as a president of the ACC . 
 = = Later life = = 
 He retired from the University of Maryland in 1963 but continued teaching Epidemiology into the 1970s . Faber was inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame that year and into the University of Maryland Athletic Hall of Fame in 1983 . He survived his wife of 62 years , <unk> née <unk> , who died in 1992 . Faber died of pneumonia two years later on January 14 , 1994 , and was interred at Arlington National Cemetery . The University of Maryland Alumni Association Hall of Fame posthumously inducted Faber in 2000 . In 2003 , Maryland established the Faber Memorial Men 's Lacrosse Scholarship Endowment Fund through the Maryland Educational Foundation , Inc. to award scholarships to men 's lacrosse players . 
 = Wilhelm Lemke = 
 Wilhelm Lemke ( 27 September 1920 – 4 December 1943 ) was a Luftwaffe flying ace of World War II . Lemke was credited with 131 aerial victories — that is , 131 aerial combat encounters resulting in the destruction of the enemy aircraft . All but six of his victories were claimed over the Soviet Air Forces in 617 combat missions . 
 Born in <unk> , Lemke joined the military service in the Luftwaffe of the Third Reich in 1939 . Following flight training , he was posted to 9 . Staffel ( squadron ) of Jagdgeschwader 3 ( JG 3 — 3rd Fighter Wing ) . He flew his first combat missions in Operation Barbarossa , the German invasion of the Soviet Union , and claimed his first aerial victory on 26 June 1941 . There , after 59 aerial victories , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross on 12 September 1942 . He was given command as Staffelkapitän ( squadron leader ) of 9 . Staffel on 11 August 1942 . On 16 March 1943 , he was credited with his 100th aerial victory . Four months later , on 28 July 1943 , he claimed his 125th and last victory on the Eastern Front . 
 Lemke was subsequently relocated to the Western Front , where he flew in the Defense of the Reich and claimed six further victories . In mid @-@ November 1943 , he was appointed Gruppenkommandeur ( group commander ) of the II . Gruppe ( 2nd group ) of JG 3 " Udet " ; he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves on 25 November . Lemke was killed in action on 4 December 1943 northwest of Nijmegen in combat with United States Army Air Forces fighters .

 Lemke , the son of a civil servant , was born on 27 September 1920 in <unk> near <unk> , in what was then the Free State of Prussia of the Weimar Republic ( today <unk> in Poland ) . He joined the military service of the Luftwaffe as a Fahnenjunker ( cadet ) on 15 November 1939 . Following fighter pilot training , he was promoted to Leutnant ( second lieutenant ) on 1 April 1941 .

 Lemke was posted to a front @-@ line unit in 1941 , almost two years after the start of World War II . His unit was 9 . Staffel ( squadron ) of Jagdgeschwader 3 ( JG 3 — 3rd Fighter Wing ) . In preparation for Operation Barbarossa , the German invasion of the Soviet Union , JG 3 under the command of Major ( major ) Günther Lützow was relocated east . Lemke claimed two Soviet Tupolev SB @-@ 2 bombers shot down on 26 June 1941 — his first aerial victories . He was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class ( Eisernes Kreuz zweiter Klasse ) on 4 July 1941 and Iron Cross 1st Class ( Eisernes Kreuz erster Klasse ) on 20 July . 
 By 26 August 1941 , Lemke had accumulated 15 aerial victories . On this day , flying Messerschmitt Bf 109 F @-@ 2 ( <unk> <unk> — factory number ) , he was hit and wounded in the abdomen during combat with Soviet bombers but managed to make an emergency landing . On 3 November 1941 , while convalescing , he was awarded the Honor Goblet of the Luftwaffe ( Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe ) . He returned to active service on 17 February 1942 and was posted to 8 . Staffel of JG 3 " Udet " . On 31 March 1942 , Lemke claimed his 20th aerial victory . He claimed three Lavochkin @-@ Gorbunov @-@ Gudkov LaGG @-@ 3 fighters shot down in combat with 6 UAG ( 6th Soviet strike aviation group — <unk> Aviatsionnaya <unk> ) on 4 April . He was credited with his 30th victory on 24 June 1942 , and aerial victories 39 to 42 on 29 July . Subsequently , he was nominated for the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) by his 8 . Staffel . He was given command as Staffelkapitän ( squadron leader ) of his former 9 . Staffel on 11 August 1942 , leading this unit until 5 November 1943 . 
 Lemke claimed his 57th victory on 7 September 1942 , his 58th one day later , and his 59th victory on 11 September . The next day , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross . On 27 December , he involuntarily rammed a LaGG @-@ 3 in combat . By 31 December 1942 his score had increased to 90 victories . As well as his aerial victories , he was credited with the destruction of aircraft on the ground , as well as three tanks , three fuel trucks , eleven other trucks , three Katyusha rocket launchers , one anti @-@ tank gun , and two mortars . On 16 March 1943 , he claimed his 100th aerial victory , a Lavochkin La @-@ 5 fighter . Lemke was the 35th Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark . He was promoted to Oberleutnant ( first lieutenant ) on 1 April 1943 and to Hauptmann ( captain ) on 1 June . He was credited with his last victory on the Eastern Front on 28 July 1943 , taking his total to 125 .

 On 2 August 1943 , JG 3 " Udet " began transferring to Western Front and flew in Defense of the Reich . Lemke claimed two United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) Republic P @-@ 47 Thunderbolt fighters shot down on 17 August during the Schweinfurt – Regensburg mission , his first on the Western Front . By 14 October 1943 , he was credited with one victory and two <unk> ( separation shots ) — a severely damaged heavy bomber forced to separate from his combat box , which was counted as an aerial victory — over Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress bombers . On that day , he claimed his 129th and 130th victory , one of which was a Herausschuss , over B @-@ 17s on their second Raid on Schweinfurt . 
 In mid @-@ November 1943 , Lemke was appointed Gruppenkommandeur ( group commander ) of the II . Gruppe ( 2nd group ) of JG 3 " Udet " . He succeeded Major Kurt Brändle , who had been killed in action on 3 November . Lemke surrendered command of 9 . Staffel to Leutnant Ekkehard Tichy and took command of the Gruppe a few days later at the Schiphol airfield , near Amsterdam in the Netherlands . He was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub ) on 25 November , the 338th officer or soldier of the Wehrmacht so honored . On 30 November 1943 at 11 : 25 am , he achieved his 131st and final aerial victory over a P @-@ 47 . 
 Lemke was killed in action in his Bf 109 G @-@ 6 ( <unk> <unk> ) on 4 December 1943 near <unk> , 12 kilometers ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) northwest Nijmegen .

 = <unk> shyshark = 
 The puffadder shyshark or happy Eddie ( Haploblepharus edwardsii ) is a species of catshark , belonging to the family Scyliorhinidae , endemic to the temperate waters off the coast of South Africa . This common shark is found on or near the bottom in sandy or rocky habitats , from the intertidal zone to a depth of 130 m ( 430 ft ) . Typically reaching 60 cm ( 24 in ) in length , the puffadder shyshark has a slender , flattened body and head . It is strikingly patterned with a series of dark @-@ edged , bright orange " saddles " and numerous small white spots over its back . The Natal shyshark ( H. <unk> ) , formally described in 2006 , was once considered to be an alternate form of the puffadder shyshark . 
 When threatened , the puffadder shyshark ( and other members of its genus ) curls into a circle with its tail covering its eyes , giving rise to the local names " shyshark " and " doughnut " . It is a predator that feeds mainly on crustaceans , polychaete worms , and small bony fishes . This shark is oviparous and females deposit egg capsules singly or in pairs onto underwater structures . Harmless to humans , the puffadder shyshark is usually discarded by commercial and recreational fishers alike for its small size . It has been assessed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , as its entire population is located within a limited area and could be affected by a local increase in fishing pressure or habitat degradation . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The first known reference to the puffadder shyshark in literature was by prominent English naturalist George Edwards in 1760 , by the name Catulus major vulgaris , of three individuals caught off the Cape of Good Hope that have since been lost . In 1817 , French zoologist Georges Cuvier described this species as " Scyllium D <unk> " , based on Edwards ' account , though he was not considered to be proposing a true scientific name . In 1832 , German zoologist Friedrich Siegmund Voigt translated Cuvier 's description under the name Scyllium edwardsii , thus receiving attribution for the species . However , in 2001 <unk> van <unk> discovered that Swiss naturalist Heinrich Rudolf Schinz had provided an earlier translation of Cuvier 's text with the proper scientific name in 1822 , and subsequently the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) rendered a decision that this species is properly attributed to Schinz . In 1913 , American zoologist Samuel Garman created the new genus Haploblepharus for this and other shyshark species . 
 Two forms of puffadder shyshark were once recognized : " Cape " and " Natal " , which differed in appearance and habitat preferences . In 2006 , the " Natal " form was described as a new species , the Natal shyshark . A 2006 phylogenetic analysis , based on three mitochondrial DNA genes , found that the puffadder shyshark is the most basal member of its family , with a sister relationship to the clade containing the dark shyshark ( H. pictus ) and the brown shyshark ( H. fuscus ) . The Natal shyshark was not included in the study , though it is very close morphologically to this species . The common name " puffadder shyshark " refers to the puff adder ( Bitis arietans ) , a widely distributed African viper with similar coloration . " Happy Eddie " ( from the scientific name Haploblepharus edwardsii ) is used by academics for this shark , and was recently introduced to the public as an easily remembered alternative to the ambiguous vernaculars " shyshark " and " doughnut " , which can apply to several different species and have confounded research efforts . 
 = = Description = = 
 The puffadder shyshark is more slender than other shysharks , with a short , broad , dorsally flattened head and a narrowly rounded snout . The large , oval @-@ shaped eyes have cat @-@ like slit pupils , a simple nictitating membrane ( a protective third eyelid ) , and a prominent ridge underneath . The nostrils are very large , with a pair of greatly expanded , triangular flaps of skin in front that are fused together and reach the mouth . There is a deep groove connecting the excurrent ( outflow ) opening of each nostril to the mouth , obscured by the nasal flaps . The mouth is short with furrows at the corners on both jaws . There are 26 – 30 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 27 – 33 tooth rows in the lower jaw . Tooth shape is sexually dimorphic : those of males are longer and three @-@ pointed , while those of females are shorter and five @-@ pointed . Unusually , the two halves of the lower jaw are connected by a special cartilage , which allows a more even distribution of teeth and may increase bite strength . 
 The five pairs of gill slits are positioned somewhat on the upper surface of the body . The dorsal , pelvic , and anal fins are all of similar size . The dorsal fins are located far back on the body , the first originating behind the pelvic fin origins and the second behind the anal fin origin . The pectoral fins are broad and of moderate size . The short , broad caudal fin comprises about one @-@ fifth of the body length and has a deep ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe and a barely developed lower lobe . The skin is thick and covered by well @-@ calcified , leaf @-@ shaped dermal denticles . The dorsal coloration consists of a light to dark brown background with a series of 8 – 10 striking yellowish to reddish brown " saddles " with darker margins , all covered by a profusion of small white spots . The underside is white . This species attains a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) , with a maximum record of 69 cm ( 27 in ) . Sharks found west of Cape Agulhas are smaller than those found east , reaching only 48 cm ( 19 in ) long . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The range of the puffadder shyshark is limited to the continental shelf along the coast of South Africa , from <unk> Lagoon in Western Cape Province to the western shore of Algoa Bay . Previous records of it being found as far north as Durban are now thought to be misidentifications of other species . This bottom @-@ dwelling shark is most common over sandy or rocky bottoms . It is found in progressively deeper water towards the northeastern portion of its range , from 0 – 15 m ( 0 – 49 ft ) off Cape Town to 40 – 130 m ( 130 – 430 ft ) off KwaZulu @-@ Natal ; this distribution pattern may reflect this shark 's preference for cooler waters . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Quite common within its small range , the sluggish and reclusive puffadder shyshark is often seen lying still on the sea floor . It is gregarious and several individuals may rest together . A generalist predator with grasping dentition , the puffadder shyshark is known to take a variety of small benthic prey : crustaceans ( including crabs , shrimp , crayfish , mantis shrimp , and hermit crabs ) , annelid worms ( including polychaetes ) , bony fishes ( including anchovies , jack <unk> , and gobies ) , cephalopods ( including squid ) , and fish offal . Overall , the most important component of this shark 's diet is crustaceans , followed by polychaetes and then fishes . Males seem to prefer polychaetes , while females prefer crustaceans . It has been observed attacking a common octopus ( Octopus vulgaris ) by tearing off an arm with a twisting motion . 
 The puffadder shyshark is preyed upon by larger fishes , such as the broadnose sevengill shark ( Notorynchus cepedianus ) . The Cape fur seal ( Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus ) has been documented capturing and playing with puffadder shysharks , tossing them into the air or gnawing on them . The shark is often injured or killed during these encounters ; the seal may eat torn @-@ off pieces of flesh , but seldom consumes the entire shark . On occasion , black @-@ backed kelp gulls ( Larus dominicanus <unk> ) take advantage of this behavior and steal the sharks from the seals . When threatened or disturbed , the puffadder shyshark adopts a characteristic posture in which it curls into a ring and covers its eyes with its tail ; this reaction is the basis for the common names " shyshark " and " doughnut " , and is likely meant to make the shark harder for a predator to swallow . 
 The eggs of the puffadder shyshark are fed upon by the whelks Burnupena papyracea and B. lagenaria , at least in captivity . Known parasites of this species include the trypanosome Trypanosoma <unk> , which infests the blood , the nematode Proleptus obtusus , which infests the intestine , and the copepods <unk> <unk> and Perissopus <unk> , which infest the skin . Another parasite is the praniza larval stage of the isopod Gnathia pantherina , which infests the nares , mouth , and gills . The deep @-@ penetrating mouthparts of these larvae significantly damage local tissue , causing bleeding and inflammation . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 The puffadder shyshark is oviparous ; there is no distinct breeding season and reproduction occurs year @-@ round . Females deposit egg capsules one or two at a time , attaching them to vertical structures such as sea fans . The thin @-@ walled egg cases are brown with distinctive pale transverse bands ; and have a slightly furry texture and long adhesive tendrils at the corners . They are smaller than those of other shyshark species , measuring 3 @.@ 5 – 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) long and 1 @.@ 5 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 59 – 1 @.@ 18 in ) across . The young shark hatches after three months , and measures around 9 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) long . The length at maturation for both sexes has been reported as anywhere from 35 to 55 cm ( 14 to 22 in ) by various sources ; this high degree of variation may reflect regional differences as sharks from deeper waters in the eastern part of its range seem to mature at a larger size than those from the west . The age at maturation is estimated to be around 7 years , and the maximum lifespan is at least 22 years . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Harmless to humans , the puffadder shyshark can be easily caught by hand . Not targeted by commercial fisheries because of its small size , it is taken incidentally and discarded by bottom trawlers operating between Mossel Bay and East London , and by fishing boats in False Bay . Many are hooked by recreational anglers casting from the shore , who also generally discard or kill them as minor pests . Some local exploitation of this species does occur for lobster bait and the aquarium trade . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed the puffadder shyshark as Near Threatened . Although it remains abundant , the small range of this shark lies entirely within a heavily fished region , and any increase in fishing activities or habitat degradation could potentially impact the entire population . 
 = Accounting ethics = 
 Accounting ethics is primarily a field of applied ethics and is part of business ethics and human ethics , the study of moral values and judgments as they apply to accountancy . It is an example of professional ethics . Accounting introduced by Luca Pacioli , and later expanded by government groups , professional organizations , and independent companies . Ethics are taught in accounting courses at higher education institutions as well as by companies training accountants and auditors . 
 Due to the diverse range of accounting services and recent corporate collapses , attention has been drawn to ethical standards accepted within the accounting profession . These collapses have resulted in a widespread disregard for the reputation of the accounting profession . To combat the criticism and prevent fraudulent accounting , various accounting organizations and governments have developed regulations and remedies for improved ethics among the accounting profession . 
 = = Importance of ethics = = 
 The nature of the work carried out by accountants and auditors requires a high level of ethics . Shareholders , potential shareholders , and other users of the financial statements rely heavily on the yearly financial statements of a company as they can use this information to make an informed decision about investment . They rely on the opinion of the accountants who prepared the statements , as well as the auditors that verified it , to present a true and fair view of the company . Knowledge of ethics can help accountants and auditors to overcome ethical dilemmas , allowing for the right choice that , although it may not benefit the company , will benefit the public who relies on the accountant / auditor 's reporting . 
 Most countries have differing focuses on enforcing accounting laws . In Germany , accounting legislation is governed by " tax law " ; in Sweden , by " accounting law " ; and in the United Kingdom , by the " company law " . In addition , countries have their own organizations which regulate accounting . For example , Sweden has the <unk> ( <unk> - Accounting Standards Board ) , Spain the Instituto de <unk> y <unk> de <unk> ( <unk> ) , and the United States the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) . 
 = = History = = 
 Luca Pacioli , the " Father of Accounting " , wrote on accounting ethics in his first book Summa de <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , et <unk> , published in 1494 . Ethical standards have since then been developed through government groups , professional organizations , and independent companies . These various groups have led accountants to follow several codes of ethics to perform their duties in a professional work environment . Accountants must follow the code of ethics set out by the professional body of which they are a member . United States accounting societies such as the Association of Government Accountants , Institute of Internal Auditors , and the National Association of Accountants all have codes of ethics , and many accountants are members of one or more of these societies . 
 In 1887 , the American Association of Public Accountants ( AAPA ) was created ; it was the first step in developing professionalism in the United States accounting industry . By 1905 , the AAPA 's first ethical codes were formulated to educate its members . During its twentieth anniversary meeting in October 1907 , ethics was a major topic of the conference among its members . As a result of discussions , a list of professional ethics was incorporated into the organization 's bylaws . However , because membership to the organization was voluntary , the association could not require individuals to conform to the suggested behaviors . Other accounting organizations , such as the Illinois Institute of Accountants , also pursued discussion on the importance of ethics for the field . The AAPA was renamed several times throughout its history , before becoming the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ( AICPA ) as it 's named today . The AICPA developed five divisions of ethical principles that its members should follow : " independence , integrity , and objectivity " ; " competence and technical standards " ; " responsibilities to clients " ; " responsibilities to colleagues " ; as well as " other responsibilities and practices " . Each of these divisions provided guidelines on how a Certified Public Accountant ( CPA ) should act as a professional . Failure to comply with the guidelines could have caused an accountant to be barred from practicing . When developing the ethical principles , the AICPA also considered how the profession would be viewed by those outside of the accounting industry . 
 = = Teaching ethics = = 
 Courses on this subject have grown significantly in the last couple of decades . Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing , lectures , case studies , guest lectures , as well as other mediums . Recent studies indicate that nearly all accounting textbooks touch on ethics in some way . In 1993 , the first United States center that focused on the study of ethics in the accounting profession opened at State University of New York at Binghamton . Starting in 1999 , several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the CPA exam . 
 In 1988 , Stephen E. Loeb proposed that accounting ethics education should include seven goals ( adapted from a list by Daniel Callahan ) . To implement these goals , he pointed out that accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject . Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject ( which may require training ) . A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student 's education ( for example , before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student 's degree requirements ) , whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class , and whether most universities have room in a four @-@ year curriculum for a single class on the subject . 
 There has been debate on whether ethics should be taught in a university setting . Supporters point out that ethics are important to the profession , and should be taught to accountants entering the field . In addition , the education would help to reinforce students ' ethical values and inspire them to prevent others from making unethical decisions . Critics argue that an individual is ethical or not , and that teaching an ethics course would serve no purpose . Despite opposition , instruction on accounting ethics by universities and conferences , has been encouraged by professional organizations and accounting firms . The Accounting Education Change Commission ( AECC ) has called for students to " know and understand the ethics of the profession and be able to make value @-@ based judgments . " 
 Phillip G. <unk> argued that in order to uphold strong ethics , an accountant " must have a strong sense of values , the ability to reflect on a situation to determine the ethical implications , and a commitment to the well @-@ being of others . " Iris Stuart recommends an ethics model consisting of four steps : the accountant must recognize that an ethical dilemma is occurring ; identify the parties that would be interested in the outcome of the dilemma ; determine alternatives and evaluate its effect on each alternative on the interested parties ; and then select the best alternative . 
 = = Accounting scandals = = 
 Accounting ethics has been deemed difficult to control as accountants and auditors must consider the interest of the public ( which relies on the information gathered in audits ) while ensuring that they remained employed by the company they are auditing . They must consider how to best apply accounting standards even when faced with issues that could cause a company to face a significant loss or even be discontinued . Due to several accounting scandals within the profession , critics of accountants have stated that when asked by a client " what does two plus two equal ? " the accountant would be likely to respond " what would you like it to be ? " . This thought process along with other criticisms of the profession 's issues with conflict of interest , have led to various increased standards of professionalism while stressing ethics in the work environment . 
 The role of accountants is critical to society . Accountants serve as financial reporters and intermediaries in the capital markets and owe their primary obligation to the public interest . The information they provide is crucial in aiding managers , investors and others in making critical economic decisions . Accordingly , ethical improprieties by accountants can be detrimental to society , resulting in distrust by the public and disruption of efficient capital market operations . 
 From the 1980s to the present there have been multiple accounting scandals that were widely reported on by the media and resulted in fraud charges , bankruptcy protection requests , and the closure of companies and accounting firms . The scandals were the result of creative accounting , misleading financial analysis , as well as bribery . Various companies had issues with fraudulent accounting practices , including <unk> Hand Bank , Phar @-@ Mor , WorldCom , and AIG . One of the most widely reported violation of accounting ethics involved Enron , a multinational company , that for several years had not shown a true or fair view of their financial statements . Their auditor Arthur Andersen , an accounting firm considered one of the " Big Five " , signed off on the validity of the accounts despite the inaccuracies in the financial statements . When the unethical activities were reported , not only did Enron dissolve but Arthur Andersen also went out of business . Enron 's shareholders lost $ 25 billion as a result of the company 's bankruptcy . Although only a fraction of Arthur Anderson 's employees were involved with the scandal , the closure of the firm resulted in the loss of 85 @,@ 000 jobs . 
 = = = Causes = = = 
 Fraudulent accounting can arise from a variety of issues . These problems usually come to light eventually and could ruin not only the company but also the auditors for not discovering or revealing the misstatements . Several studies have proposed that a firm 's corporate culture as well as the values it stresses may negatively alter an accountant 's behavior . This environment could contribute to the degradation of ethical values that were learned from universities . 
 Until 1977 , ethics rules prevented accounting and auditing firms from advertising to clients . When the rules were lifted , spending by the largest CPA firms on advertisements rose from US $ 4 million in the 1980s to more than $ 100 million in the 2000s . Critics claimed that , by allowing the firms to advertise , the business side overstepped the professional side of the profession , which led to a conflict of interest . This focus allowed for occurrences of fraud , and caused the firms , according to Arthur Bowman , " ... to offer services that made them more consultants and business advisers than auditors . " As accounting firms became less interested in the lower @-@ paying audits due to more focus on higher earning services such as consulting , problems arose . This disregard for the lack of time spent on audits resulted in a lack of attention to catching creative and fraudulent accounting . 
 A 2007 article in Managerial Auditing Journal determined the top nine factors that contributed to ethical failures for accountants based on a survey of 66 members of the International Federation of Accountants . The factors include ( in order of most significant ) : " self @-@ interest , failure to maintain objectivity and independence , inappropriate professional judgment , lack of ethical sensitivity , improper leadership and ill @-@ culture , failure to withstand advocacy threats , lack of competence , lack of organizational and peer support , and lack of professional body support . " The main factor , self @-@ interest , is the motivation by an accountant to act in his / her best interest or when facing a conflict of interest . For example , if an auditor has an issue with an account he / she is auditing , but is receiving financial incentives to ignore these issues , the auditor may act unethically . 
 = = = = Principles and rules = = = = 
 The International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) are standards and interpretations developed by the International Accounting Standards Board , which are principle @-@ based . IFRS are used by over 115 countries including the European Union , Australia , and Hong Kong . The United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) , the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting , is largely rule @-@ based . Critics have stated that the rules @-@ based GAAP is partly responsible for the number of scandals that the United States has suffered . The principles @-@ based approach to monitoring requires more professional judgment than the rules @-@ based approach . 
 There are many stakeholders in many countries such as The United States who report several concerns in the usage of rules @-@ based accounting . According to recent studies , many believe that the principles @-@ based approach in financial reporting would not only improve but would also support an auditor upon dealing with client ’ s pressure . As a result , financial reports could be viewed with fairness and transparency . When the U.S. switched to International accounting standards , they are composed that this would bring change . However , as a new chairperson of the SEC takes over the system , the transition brings a stronger review about the pros and cons of rules- based accounting . While the move towards international standards progresses , there are small amount of research that examines the effect of <unk> based standards in an auditor ’ s <unk> making process . According to 114 auditing experts , most are willing to allow clients to manage their net income based on rules- based standards . These results offers insight to the SEC , IASB and FASB in weighing the arguments in the debate of <unk> vs. rules <unk> accounting . 
 IFRS is based on " understandability , relevance , materiality , reliability , and comparability " . Since IFRS has not been adopted by all countries , these practices do not make the international standards viable in the world domain . In particular , the United States has not yet conformed and still uses GAAP which makes comparing principles and rules difficult . In August 2008 , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) proposed that the United States switch from GAAP to IFRS , starting in 2014 . 
 = = = Responses to scandals = = = 
 Since the major accounting scandals , new reforms , regulations , and calls for increased higher education have been introduced to combat the dangers of unethical behavior . By educating accountants on ethics before entering the workforce , such as through higher education or initial training at companies , it is believed it will help to improve the credibility of the accounting profession . Companies and accounting organizations have expanded their assistance with educators by providing education materials to assist professors in educating students . 
 New regulations in response to the scandals include the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004 in Australia as well as the Sarbanes @-@ Oxley Act of 2002 , developed by the United States . Sarbanes @-@ Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms . In addition , the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can receive from one client as a percentage of their total fees . This ensures that companies are not wholly reliant on one firm for its income , in the hope that they do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income . The act also protects whistleblowers and requires senior management in public companies to sign off on the accuracy of its company 's accounting records . In 2002 , the five members of the Public Oversight Board ( POB ) , which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession , resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel , the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ( <unk> ) . The <unk> was developed through the Act , and replaced the POB . 
 In 2003 , the International Federation of Accountants ( <unk> ) released a report entitled Rebuilding Public Confidence in Financial Reporting : An International Perspective . By studying the international company collapses as a result of accounting issues , it determined areas for improvement within organizations as well as recommendations for companies to develop more effective ethics codes . The report also recommended that companies pursue options that would improve training and support so accountants could better handle ethical dilemmas . A collaborative effort by members of the international financial regulatory community led by Michel Prada , Chairman of the French Financial Markets Authority , resulting in establishment of the Public Interest Oversight Board ( <unk> ) on 1 March 2005 . The <unk> provides oversight of the <unk> standards @-@ setting boards : the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board ( <unk> ) , the International Accounting Education Standards Board ( <unk> ) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants ( <unk> ) . 
 The most recent reform came into effect in July 2010 when President Obama signed " The Dodd @-@ Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act " . The act covers a broad range of changes . The highlights of the legislation are consumer protections with authority and independence , ends too big to fail bail outs , advance warning system , transparency and accountability for exotic instruments , executive compensation and corporate governance , protects investors , and enforces regulations on the books . The legislation also resulted in the Office of the Whistleblower , which was established to administer the SEC 's whistleblower program . Congress authorized the SEC to provide monetary awards to whistleblowers who come forward with information that results in a minimum of a $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sanction . The rewards are between 10 % and 30 % of the dollar amount collected . <unk> help identify fraud and other unethical behaviors early on . The result is less harm to investors , quickly holding offenders responsible , and to maintain the integrity of the U.S. markets . 
 = Divisional Cavalry Regiment ( New Zealand ) = 
 The Divisional Cavalry Regiment , commonly known as Div Cav , was an armoured cavalry regiment of the 2nd New Zealand Division during the Second World War and was New Zealand 's first armoured unit . The regiment served as a reconnaissance force for the 2nd New Zealand Division . Formed on 29 September 1939 , the regiment embarked for Egypt on 4 January 1940 . It and the division , part of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force , fought in Greece , Crete , North Africa and Italy . The regiment formed part of J Force , New Zealand 's contribution to the occupation of Japan at the end of the war . 
 Initially stationed at Maadi , the regiment was moved to Garawla in July and participated in the defence of the Baggush Box two months later . In January 1941 , it moved to Helwan for training . In March , the regiment became part of W Force , the British contingent sent to Greece to defend the country from Germany . It took up positions on the Aliakmon Line before the regiment was scattered during the British retreat from the country . Most of the regiment ended up in Crete , where it faced a German paratroop attack in May and evacuated with the remainder of the British force . 
 After spending several months <unk> , Div Cav fought in Operation Crusader and was the first unit to enter Bardia in January 1942 . After returning to Maadi , the regiment was sent to Syria with the 2nd New Zealand Division to prevent an Axis attack from Turkey and was sent back to Egypt after the British rout in the Battle of Gazala . It fought at the first and second battles of El Alamein and the Battle of Alam el Halfa . The regiment pursued retreating German troops and fought at the Battle of El Agheila . In January 1943 it was based at Castel Benito , and participated in the March Battle of the Mareth Line . After the German surrender in Tunisia on 13 May , the regiment moved back to Maadi for refitting . 
 In September the regiment was sent to Italy with the rest of the division and fought in the Moro River Campaign on the Adriatic coast in December . The division fought in the Battle of Monte Cassino , for which Div Cav provided support . The regiment then participated in the drive on the Gothic Line , where elements entered Florence in August . In October it was reorganised as the Divisional Cavalry Battalion , an infantry unit , because its armoured cars were unsuitable for Italian terrain . The battalion fought in the final Allied offensive in Italy , Operation Grapeshot , during the spring of 1945 . It reached Trieste in the first week of May and was stationed there until February 1946 . That month the Divisional Cavalry deployed to Japan , once again called a regiment . Stationed in southern Kyushu , it was disbanded on 1 September 1947 . 
 = = Formation = = 
 The regiment was mobilised as part of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force ( 2 NZEF ) in September 1939 and was issued with six Bren gun carriers . It had a headquarters , HQ squadron and a machine @-@ gun squadron ; the structure was soon changed to conform with that of the British Divisional Cavalry Regiments , which included three fighting squadrons and a headquarters squadron . The regiment was established from 27 – 30 September at Ngaruawahia Military Camp , except for No. 3 Squadron ( later C Squadron ) , which was formed at Narrow Neck . It was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Caro Pierce , a World War I veteran and Military Cross recipient . The squadrons at Ngaruawahia were visited by Governor @-@ General George Galway on 30 November . A special march through Auckland Domain was held on 3 January and next day , the regiment ( except for C Squadron ) embarked for Egypt aboard the troopship RMS <unk> . The <unk> arrived at Port Tewfik on 13 February and the regiment disembarked the following day and entrained for the New Zealand base camp at Maadi , the central depot and training area for 2 NZEF in the Middle East . In March , twelve Bren gun carriers and five Light Tanks Mark III arrived and tank @-@ gunnery training began on the range at Abbassia ; the regiment participated in brigade manoeuvres at El Saff the following month . On 19 June , the regiment experienced its first fatality when Trooper Vincent Thompson died of meningitis . 
 C Squadron completed its training in New Zealand , was attached to the Second Echelon of the 2 NZEF ( which included the 5th Brigade ) and was diverted to Britain , while <unk> to Egypt , when Italy entered the war and arrived on 16 June . The squadron was based near Aldershot and conducted further training there . C Squadron became part of the Second Echelon 's Headquarters Covering Force , defending Britain against German invasion . In early September , the squadron was moved to Westwell , Kent ; it underwent further training and was sent back to Aldershot in November . With the remainder of the 5th Brigade , C Squadron left Britain for Egypt on 4 January 1941 . 
 In July 1940 , the 2nd New Zealand Division was sent to Mersa Matruh . The cavalry regiment , camped at Garawla , dug the outer anti @-@ tank ditch along the Wadi <unk> ( later known as the Kiwi Canal ) . That month , volunteers from the regiment joined the Long Range Desert Patrol , and the regiment 's base came under air attack . In the pre @-@ dawn darkness of 15 July , Italian bombers attempting to bomb the NAAFI dump were driven off by anti @-@ aircraft fire from the regiment . During the night of 18 July , regimental anti @-@ aircraft guns mistakenly fired on a damaged Bristol Blenheim . The regiment received orders to move to Baggush and build fortifications , completing the move on 1 September ; the following day , it began constructing defences at Maaten Baggush . After finishing the task , it was transferred to the rear area at El Daba in a week . The regiment defended No. 2 sector of the Baggush Box . After Operation Compass began on 9 December , a number of Italian Fiat M11 / 39 tanks were left behind at <unk> . The regiment was ordered to salvage the tanks and on 15 December , Lieutenant H. A. Robinson led a party of 25 other ranks to <unk> for the task . Div Cav received Marmon @-@ Herrington Armoured Cars , replacing its obsolete Light Tanks Mk II and Mk III , and was transferred to Helwan in January 1941 . The mortally ill Pierce was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Carruth on 22 February and C Squadron joined the regiment at Helwan on 5 March . 
 = = Greece = = 
 In early March 1941 , the 2nd New Zealand Division ( including Div Cav ) was earmarked for W Force , the British Commonwealth force sent to Greece to bolster its defence against a German invasion . The regiment embarked for Greece on 18 March 1941 on the Greek ship Ionia , with its vehicles aboard the cargo ship Anglo @-@ Canadian . The ships arrived at Piraeus on 21 March and the troops stayed at the transit camp at <unk> . The regiment advanced northward , reaching its position on the Aliakmon Line near Katerini on 26 March . Its mission was to destroy the Aliakmon River bridges , delaying the German advance . Two troops of artillery , consisting of four 25 @-@ pounder and four 2 @-@ pounder guns , were attached to the regiment . On 4 April , two troops of Marmon @-@ Harrington armoured cars were sent to reinforce the British 1st Armoured Brigade on the Macedonian plain and in exchange , the regiment received seven cruiser tanks . The two troops withdrew with the 1st Armoured Brigade when it retreated on 8 April and reached <unk> by the following day . The regiment and E Troop , 5th Field Regiment were the only units left on the plain between Mount Olympus and the Aliakmon on 8 April . The next day , A Squadron demolished the main bridge across the Aliakmon , after the 1st Armoured Brigade had withdrawn southward . 
 German forces reached the regimental positions on 12 April ; the following day , their attempts to cross the river in assault boats were repulsed . During the evening , the regiment disengaged and fell back to <unk> and it was attacked by German tanks and infantry on 14 April . Boys anti @-@ tank rifles were useless against the German tanks , although Bren gun fire was effective against the German infantry . When its positions were flanked by tanks , the regiment retreated to Olympus Pass and was ordered to take up positions at <unk> Pass as a rearguard . The pass , a possible withdrawal route for the 1st Armoured Brigade , was reached on 15 April . On the 17th , division commander Major General Bernard Freyberg dispersed the regiment to screen the rear of his retreating troops . The next day , A and C Squadrons withdrew from Olympus Pass and <unk> after a German tank attack . B Squadron fought a rearguard action at Tempe , retreating down the Volos road and losing several carriers . 
 The regiment , reunited on the Volos road , retreated to the Thermopylae Line . On 21 April it was ordered to patrol Euboea but its vehicles were too badly damaged to do so . The Divisional Cavalry , less A Squadron , was instructed instead to screen <unk> under Lieutenant Colonel Clifton , to cover the retreat of the 4th NZ Brigade ; A Squadron was detached to screen the withdrawal of the 1st Armoured Brigade at <unk> . By the evening of 25 April , the Div Cav had fulfilled its mission and retreated beyond the village of Mazi . In the evening , Div Cav was ordered to guard the Corinth Canal bridge ; A Squadron retreated with the 1st Armoured Brigade to <unk> . A and B Squadrons retreated to <unk> Beach , embarking on the supply ship Glengyle . One hundred and fifty men from the regiment were left behind and were taken out by HMS Havock on the night of 27 April . C Squadron , caught in the German paratroop attack on Corinth , was forced to abandon its vehicles . It marched to <unk> for embarkation but the ship they were scheduled to board was full and the squadron instead set off for Crete in <unk> . 
 = = Crete = = 
 The evacuation of Greece divided the regiment , Regimental headquarters and most of HQ Squadron were sent to Egypt and most of the other three squadrons remained on Crete . A total of 194 soldiers from the regiment were on the island , with several wounded men evacuated to Egypt ; A , B and C Squadrons trained and reequipped . Div Cav , commanded by Major J. T. Russell and renamed Russell Force , joined the ad @-@ hoc 10th NZ Brigade under newly promoted Acting Colonel Howard Kippenberger and was positioned on the road from Chania to <unk> . Russell Force was moved to <unk> in early May 1941 . 
 German paratroops attacked Crete on 20 May . Many paratroopers landed near the Div Cav positions and were beaten back . Cut off from the 10th Brigade headquarters , Russell followed Kippenberger 's orders and withdrew to Galatas in Chania , to reinforce a Greek unit south of the village . At dusk , the regiment dug in near a stone wall . B Squadron held the right flank and C Squadron the centre ; A Squadron and the 19th Battalion held the left , with the Greek unit in reserve . 
 The brigade was strafed by German aircraft on the morning of 21 May . The 19th Battalion ( supported by C Squadron and light tanks from the 3rd Hussars ) assaulted Cemetery Hill , where two German machine guns threatened A and C Squadrons and part of the battalion . Although the Germans were driven off , the battalion could not hold under heavy mortar fire and withdrew ; Cemetery Hill became a no man 's land . On 25 May , heavy German attacks drove British forces from Wheat Hill and exposed the centre of the 18th Battalion , which withdrew through Galatas . The right flank of Div Cav and the Petrol Company , acting as infantry , was exposed and the 23rd Battalion counter @-@ attacked and retook Galatas at dusk , withdrawing during the night . That night Div Cav retreated to Church Hill , behind the 19th Battalion . At 01 : 00 on 26 May the regiment joined remnants of the 21st Battalion commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Allen on the main coast road between Chania and Galatas on Hellfire Hill . 
 The force retreated by night to a position near Suda Bay , where the 21st Battalion took up positions on 42nd Street with Div Cav in reserve . The regiment fell back to <unk> , arriving at 04 : 00 on 28 April and formed the extreme right of a defensive position , with the 23rd Battalion on the left . During the afternoon it was ordered to withdraw through <unk> towards Sphakia . After reaching Sphakia on 31 April , the regiment was evacuated by HMS Abdiel to Egypt that night and during the early morning of 1 June . The regiment suffered a total of 130 casualties in Greece and Crete , including 61 captured and 17 killed .

 On 3 June , the rest of the regiment arrived at Helwan from Crete . Major Arthur Nicoll succeeded Carruth in command after the latter took command of the Composite Training Depot on 26 July . Fourteen Bren Gun Carriers arrived on 22 August 1941 and replacements were trained . In early September , the regiment prepared to move into the Western Desert to take part in the coming British offensive to raise the siege of Tobruk . An advance party , led by Major Russell , left Helwan on 14 September and the regiment garrisoned the Baggush Box in September and October . In October , it received 26 Light Tank Mk VI . 
 During Operation Crusader , it was planned that the New Zealand Division would cross the Egyptian border north of and parallel to XXX Corps and would then advance northwards . The offensive was to begin on 17 November . In early November , Div Cav left Baggush and took the main road to Mersa Matruh ( Matruh ) . It then took the Siwa road past Matruh , moving south for an hour before swinging west into the desert . The regiment bivouacked at dusk and continued in stages the following day . Lieutenant Colonel Nicoll visited the 4th Indian Division headquarters on 9 November . Regimental Headquarters , B and C Squadrons were brought under command of the 4th Indian Division , advancing to Alam el <unk> the next day . A Squadron continued 10 mi ( 16 km ) and was taken under the command of the 4th South African Armoured Car Regiment , with the HQ Squadron was 12 mi ( 19 km ) behind with the B Echelon of the South Africans . A troop of the 65th Anti @-@ Tank Regiment and a troop of the 57th Light Anti @-@ Aircraft Regiment ( 57th LAA ) were placed under Div Cav ; the 57th LAA shot down an Italian aircraft at El Rabta on 14 November . 
 At dusk on 17 November , Regimental HQ and A Squadron advanced to El Beida ; C Squadron bivouacked at El Rabta and B Squadron screened the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade as it advanced towards Bir Gibni . C Squadron crossed the frontier towards Bir Gibni the following day , joined by Regimental Headquarters and A Squadron later in the morning . B Squadron patrolled the Indian brigade 's flank near Bir Gibni and was fired on by German Panzer III tanks . One Panzer III was disabled by 2 @-@ pounder anti @-@ tank guns , and was towed away by a retreating Panzer . B Squadron pulled back a mile at night and laagered . At 15 : 00 on 19 November , the regiment advanced towards Bir Gibni , with C Squadron forward and A Squadron in reserve . C Squadron reached the Trigh el Abd and observed the British 4th Armoured Brigade fighting a battle group from the 21st Panzer Division . B Squadron was transferred back to regimental command late on 19 November , after providing flank support to the 7th Indian Brigade . 
 On the morning of 20 November , B Squadron patrolled in front of the 4th Indian Division and captured a German car and its passenger . C Squadron patrolled closer to Bir Gibni , observing the tank battles in that area . XIII Corps began driving north the following day ; Div Cav advanced to Sidi Azeiz , capturing 49 Italians from the 52nd Anti @-@ Aircraft Battery and six German and Italian artillerymen . After the engagement at Sidi Azeiz , the regiment formed a line at Bir ez Zemla . The 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade arrived the next day ; the 20th Battalion attacked enemy positions , while C Squadron captured several Italian machine @-@ gun posts . A Squadron captured three grounded German aircraft , taking prisoners and B Squadron captured five ambulance cars with their drivers . On the evening of 22 November , the regimental line was taken over by units of the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade and C Squadron was transferred to command of the 4th Infantry Brigade for its advance on Gambut ; the rest of Div Cav moved to Sidi Azeiz . 
 = = = = C Squadron at Gambut and Ed Duda = = = = 
 C Squadron , leading a brigade group , advanced towards Gambut on the morning of 23 November . On the outskirts of Gambut , the line was stopped to allow the Matilda tanks to lead the column . C Squadron , ordered to charge into Gambut , when it became apparent that the Axis was retreating , pursued until the New Zealand infantry engaged and then withdrew to Gambut aerodrome . The following evening , the squadron screened the 4th Brigade Group and advanced westward before being recalled at dusk . On 25 November , C Squadron screened the brigade in its advance on Sidi Rezegh and captured a number of German soldiers before being sent to guard divisional headquarters . Four Stuart tanks , captured from the British by the Germans and then recaptured , were given to C Squadron on the afternoon of 27 November . 
 Next day , the squadron patrolled the Sidi Rezegh and Gambut escarpments , driving off German tanks and infantry in the afternoon and incurring vehicle and crew losses . The German column turned north during the night , attacking the divisional headquarters from the east ; the four Stuart tanks repulsed the assault ; 2 and 5 Troops attempted to regain the New Zealand field hospital , which had been captured the night before . They withdrew , narrowly escaping encirclement by German tanks from the 15th Panzer Division . When the remnants of the 21st Battalion were destroyed on Point 175 , the New Zealand Division rear was shelled . The Italian <unk> Armoured Division attacked on 30 November and were repulsed by the divisional artillery . During the afternoon , the 24th Battalion and most of the 26th were overrun by the 15th Panzer Division . 
 On 1 December , the Germans overran the 20th Battalion and split the 19th in half , cutting off the 18th Battalion . The remnants of the 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigade fell back through the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade to Zaafran and the Ed Duda corridor was closed . The division retreated , led along the Trigh Capuzzo by C Squadron , which halted at Bir Gibni at 04 : 00 on 2 December . At noon , the squadron headed north to rejoin the regiment . 
 = = = = Regiment at Bardia = = = = 
 B and C Squadrons were ordered to patrol Sidi Azeiz on 24 November , linking the 22nd and 23rd Battalion positions and screening the brigade against an expected German assault on 25 November . On the morning of 26 November , several German transport vehicles were captured when they ran into the B Squadron laager . The squadrons patrolled the line , capturing several prisoners , before withdrawing from a German attack on 27 November . After the brigade headquarters was captured , the regiment set off to join the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade at Sidi Omar Nuovo , moving to Bir Zemla to cut Bardia 's communications from the west on 1 – 3 December . On 3 December , an Axis column approached ; the regiment retreated , leading the Axis into an ambush by the 28th Maori Battalion and 22nd Infantry Battalion . C Squadron arrived on 6 December and the squadrons screened at Menastir . On 7 December , the regiment split into four mobile columns and moved west , discovering 29 tanks in a wadi near the coast . Two days later A and C Squadrons and three anti @-@ tank gun batteries attacked the area , a tank @-@ repair workshop , destroying the tanks and taking 30 prisoners . 
 From 10 to 16 December , the regiment established a chain of posts on the roads south of Bardia to prevent Axis movement . The 2nd South African Division , supported by A and C Squadrons , made an abortive attack Bardia on 16 December ; the 2nd South African battalions retreated two days later . The regiment participated in a deception operation , concealing the attack on Bardia with dummy tanks in the desert . On 2 January 1942 , Lieutenant E. W. Kerr accepted the surrender of German General Artur Schmitt . HQ and B Squadrons entered Bardia after Kerr 's troops , releasing Allied prisoners and C Squadron was the first Allied force to enter Bardia . On 6 January , the regiment left Bardia for Baggush , returning to Maadi on 26 January . 
 = = = Syria and Rommel 's second offensive = = = 
 On 13 March , the New Zealand Division moved to Syria to build fortifications in the Beqaa Valley , to protect against the prospect of an Axis attack from Turkey . The regiment had to build roads at <unk> and Wadi Fa <unk> , camping at <unk> . In mid @-@ May the road @-@ building was finished and the regiment prepared for manoeuvres with the 4th and 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigades . On 21 May , the regiment moved into the desert for the manoeuvres . When the exercises were completed on 1 June , it returned to <unk> for more training . 
 On 16 June , the Div Cav was ordered to move to Egypt with the rest of the division . The offensive by General Erwin Rommel had created a need for more troops to stop the Axis advance . The regiment arrived at Matruh ten days later , where it was to cover the northern and eastern parts of the minefields around the village . Div Cav was the last of the divisional units to arrive back in Egypt . When the division left Matruh on 26 June , the regiment 's tanks and carriers had not yet arrived . B Squadron was equipped with carriers and transport available in Matruh and was sent ahead to Garawla , losing two carriers to tanks along the way and split up in the darkness . Half went to Minqar Qaim , where the 4th and 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigades were positioned and the other half , led by Major Sutherland , laagered in a depression and was surrounded by German tanks . Sutherland 's force broke out , losing one soldier who was taken prisoner . Arriving at headquarters at 08 : 00 , he found the rest of the squadron . B Squadron was then sent to Bir <unk> to replace the 21st Battalion , patrolling there for the rest of the day . By evening the division was nearly surrounded , so acting division commander Brigadier Inglis decided on a breakout to Fortress A ( also known as the Kaponga Box ) south @-@ west of El Alamein . B Squadron retreated south along the Qattara Depression before turning north to the fortress , rejoining the regiment on 30 June . 
 The remainder of Div Cav left Matruh for Fuka on 27 June , receiving new Bren Gun Carriers at Baggush and A Squadron prepared the new carriers for battle . After a report of approaching Axis tanks , the squadrons were withdrawn to Daba on 28 June and to Fortress A in the afternoon . On 30 June , the regiment screened west and south of the box . From 1 July , the regiment fought in the First Battle of El Alamein . B Squadron was shelled on 1 July and withdrew to the Deir el Munassib . The regiment probed ahead of the box , engaging the Axis forces and B Squadron lost a carrier to anti @-@ tank guns on the Alam Nayil ridge . The Axis forces were halted by a New Zealand counter @-@ attack led by Brigadier Weir . Alam Nayil was captured by Weir 's force on 3 July and C Squadron held the ridge while Weir 's force pressed ahead . After the Italian guns on the ridge were destroyed , C Squadron withdrew and came under fire from Ruweisat Ridge . On 3 July , A Squadron reconnoitred around Gebel <unk> and was ineffectually shelled by the friendly 6th Field Regiment . Two troops from A Squadron engaged an Italian truck @-@ mounted battalion of the Trieste Division , destroying two trucks , capturing one Italian and releasing three Indian PoWs . 
 On 4 July , as part of a divisional attack toward Daba , the regiment was ordered to send C squadron north @-@ west to join the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade at El Mreir and continue to Daba . The squadron was ambushed on its way to El Mreir at 07 : 15 ; two carriers were destroyed and C Squadron was replaced by two troops from B Squadron shortly afterwards . During the afternoon , A and C Squadrons set out towards Daba but halted when night fell . A Squadron approached <unk> <unk> on 5 July but withdrew to <unk> el <unk> after heavy artillery fire . A and B Squadrons patrolled the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade front on 6 July . The next day , the division again attempted to drive toward the coast , after an all @-@ clear report . B Squadron screened the 4th and 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigades before being halted by Axis fire and A and C Squadrons were ordered into the line to reconnoitre . Axis tanks attacking C Squadron during the afternoon were repulsed by the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade anti @-@ tank guns . Div Cav , the rearguard for the 4th and 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade retreat , reached Deir el Munassib on the morning of 8 July and received 15 Stuarts . A Squadron patrolled the front of the 22nd Battalion during the afternoon , returning to Deir el Munassib at night . The regiment screened the front on 9 – 10 July , covering the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade night retreat . 
 A and C Squadrons supported a costly , abortive 15 July attack on Ruweisat Ridge and the regiment retreated as the division dug in at the boxes . Two troops were dispatched to join the 18th Battalion on 22 July , encountering an Axis pocket and losing a troop commander . The regiment was incorporated into the New Zealand Divisional box ; A and C Squadrons dug in , and B Squadron patrolled south . From 17 – 18 August , A and C Squadrons were relieved by the Buffs and Royal West Kents and moved out . 
 = = = Battle of Alam Halfa = = = 
 The regiment fought in the Battle of Alam el Halfa , during an attempted German thrust towards the Nile Delta . On 31 August , the regiment was alerted of the coming attack . B Squadron blocked a German advance through the box minefield , retreating after it was flanked and two troops from A Squadron drove off eight Italian Fiat M13 / 40 tanks . Later in the morning ten Axis tanks with two 88 mm guns attacked from the Deir el <unk> and were repulsed by the 26th Battery artillery . The regiment patrolled the northern flank on 3 September and was the mobile reserve during the New Zealand Division attack on the retreating Axis line . It was to follow the 132nd Infantry Brigade and advance to Deir <unk> , to destroy Axis motorized transport but the brigade was stopped and the regiment withdrew to the box .

 Div Cav moved rearward on 10 September for leave in Cairo . The regiment conducted manoeuvres with the division in September and returned to Burg el Arab . Colonel Nicoll was beaten up on 5 October by drunken soldiers in Maadi , where he had gone to arrange replacements and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel James Sutherland . A total of 23 carriers with new equipment arrived from workshops on 11 October . The regiment advanced to El Hammam on 19 October in preparation for Operation Lightfoot , the first Allied attack in the Second Battle of El Alamein ; it was notified the following day of plans to attack the Axis rear behind the armoured brigade , advancing to El <unk> . On 22 October , Div Cav moved to its starting position at Alam el Onsol . 
 The advance began at night on 23 October , with the regiment advancing down a track during the artillery barrage . At daybreak , Div Cav stopped at Miteiriya Ridge because the 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigade was unable to clear lanes through the minefield . A gap was created in the evening and B and C Squadrons advanced , screening the 9th Armoured Brigade . After traversing the minefield , the squadrons were stopped by anti @-@ tank fire . Ten men were killed , and five tanks and four carriers destroyed . 
 The next day , the regiment was withdrawn and became part of the divisional reserve at Alam el Onsol . Orders arrived for an advance on 30 October for Operation Supercharge , planned as the final attack of the battle . The regiment was placed under the command of the 9th Armoured Brigade ] ] on 1 November , with each squadron attached to an armoured unit . A Squadron was attached to the 3rd Hussars , C Squadron to the Warwickshire Yeomanry and B Squadron to the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry . The assault began the following day , with the squadrons ordered to screen the minefields for the armoured brigade . The 3rd Hussars reached the Rahman track , losing their anti @-@ tank guns . The Wiltshire Yeomanry lost a Crusader squadron to anti @-@ tank fire and was nearly destroyed by the end of the day . Four B Squadron men were killed by anti @-@ tank fire as the squadron advanced behind the <unk> . The <unk> , mistaking high ground for their objective , destroyed a number of anti @-@ tank guns there . At the end of the day the regiment , except for C Squadron , returned to Alam el Onsol . 
 Div Cav resumed the offensive on 4 November , advancing south @-@ west against retreating Axis forces and ending the day at <unk> . The regiment advanced on the northern flank of the New Zealand Division the next day , screening the division at the recaptured Baggush Box on 6 November . It then set off towards Mersa Matruh on the coast road and the escarpment , in contact with the 9th Armoured Brigade . The regiment halted at Gambut on 13 November , moving east to Menastir six days later . 
 = = = Battle of El Agheila = = = 
 Div Cav spent the first three weeks of the pursuit camped near Bardia . On 2 December , as part of the outflanking move around El Agheila , the regiment began an eight @-@ day drive on transporters to El <unk> . After unloading its vehicles , the regiment continued its flanking movement . On 14 December , it was placed under the command of the 4th Light Armoured Brigade , with which it spent the night . C Squadron screened the brigade in the morning and by 16 : 00 the regiment had drawn away from the brigade as C Squadron reached the escarpment . The German 15th Panzer Division , halted on the road due to a fuel shortage , was targeted by Div Cav . During the night , the regiment withdrew and laagered while the Germans retreated . At 05 : 45 the next morning , XXX Corps headquarters ordered the division to attack the Germans and the regiment was advised to expect an attack from the east by a hundred tanks . Div Cav was ordered to withdraw south @-@ west , along the line of its previous advance . When the regiment had gone back 6 mi ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) , it surprised a German column . A Squadron engaged , as the other squadrons hastily withdrew . In the evening , the regiment advanced a mile west and laagered . 
 On 17 December , Div Cav guarded the northern flank of the brigade in its advance on Nofilia ; B and C Squadrons engaged the German rearguard , knocking out one Panzer III and losing two carriers . The brigade failed to capture Nofilia ; although it cut the road , the Germans escaped during the night . The regiment was scheduled to camp at Nofilia for a week , with C Squadron dispatched to guard the airfield at Sultan with a detachment of engineers to clear mines . The minefield was cleared by 23 December , when A Squadron replaced C Squadron . In late December , 18 new carriers arrived and the regiment prepared for another advance . 
 = = = Advance on Tripoli = = = 
 From 8 – 9 January 1943 , Div Cav advanced again , the A Squadron vehicles at Nofilia being loaded on transporters , which drove down the main road while the rest of the regiment screened the New Zealand Division advance . The A Squadron vehicles were unloaded near Wadi Bei el <unk> , east of the expected German rearguard near Wadi <unk> and the regiment caught up on 14 January . The following day , A Squadron crossed the road and withstood shelling by anti @-@ tank guns and artillery , until the afternoon . B Squadron probed south , also encountering German anti @-@ tank guns . After one of its Stuart tanks knocked out an anti @-@ tank gun , B Squadron advanced through the German line , dislodging a number of anti @-@ tank guns and destroying a Sd.Kfz. 250 half @-@ track . During the afternoon , C Squadron failed to break through the German centre but that night the Germans withdrew . On 16 January , the regiment advanced to high ground above the airstrip at <unk> , losing a tank and carrier . C Squadron advanced down the plateau in the darkness , losing a carrier to a mine on the trail . The regiment found an alternate route , ending the day in Wadi <unk> . On 18 January , Div Cav advanced through rugged country to Beni <unk> . The regiment advanced towards <unk> the following day , bivouacking halfway there , before discovering a route through the hills north of the road . 
 On 21 January , Div Cav moved out of the hills , with C Squadron artillery driving off German rearguards . Next morning A and B Squadrons advanced west , turning north after crossing the <unk> road , before they were halted by German resistance at Azizia . The Germans retreated during the night and the regiment found an empty village in the morning . Racing down the road , Div Cav ended the day 4 mi ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) from Tripoli before being transferred to Bianchi for a week . The regiment next encamped around Castel Benito . On 28 January , Lieutenant Colonel Sutherland left for New Zealand and was replaced by Ian Bonifant . In February , the regiment unloaded supplies from landing craft in Tripoli . On the 4th , the Eighth Army paraded through the city before Winston Churchill , Bernard Montgomery , Richard McCreery and Freyberg . 
 = = = Tunisia = = = 
 The Divisional Cavalry Regiment left Castel Benito on 2 March as part of the attack on the Mareth Line . On 3 March the regiment was in Tunisia , camped near the road at Medenine . The next morning it was put under command of the 4th Light Armoured Brigade , in preparation for a German assault and moved forward , behind the 5th New Zealand Brigade positions . After the Axis repulse , A Squadron was sent south to probe the eastern end of the hills while B and C Squadrons harassed the German retreat on 7 March . The regiment patrolled the area between the 11th Hussars and the Free French Flying Column for the next five days and moved back to <unk> <unk> on 13 March , where the New Zealand Division assembled for a flanking movement inland . Div Cav advanced south @-@ west and then north , guarding the divisional right flank . On 21 March , contact was made with the Germans and elements of the division attacked during the night . C Squadron advanced behind the infantry in the morning before being stopped by shellfire near Point 201 , a battlefield elevation . As the shelling decreased , A and HQ Squadrons advanced to the C Squadron position . B Squadron arrived from night patrol , and the regiment laagered behind Point 201 . On the morning of 23 March , B and C Squadrons advanced , capturing fifteen 77 mm guns and several prisoners . From 24 to 26 March , the regiment patrolled the left flank of the line in preparation for an assault by the 1st Armoured Division . When close air support preparation for the assault began , Div Cav marked the bomb line with smoke canisters and advanced on the flank when the ground assault began . The regiment laagered next to the <unk> @-@ El Hamma road during the night . 
 On 27 March , B and C Squadrons made contact with the 1st Armoured Division and next day , the regiment maintained contact with the retreating Germans , entering <unk> the following day . Div Cav stopped at a wadi to determine where the division could cross on a nine @-@ vehicle front . A location was found on 30 March and C Squadron pressed ahead near the Wadi <unk> . The wadi was strongly defended ; the regiment patrolled and probed until 5 April , before an attack by XXX Corps infantry in which the 2nd New Zealand would be in reserve . The assault did not break through the Axis resistance on the first day but succeeded on the second morning and the division pursued , the regiment advanced with the division , capturing 1 @,@ 300 PoWs . On 8 April , it became part of a battlegroup consisting of the 8th Armoured and 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigades and the 1st King 's Dragoon Guards ( <unk> ) . The regiment advanced another 20 mi ( 32 km ) halting in the afternoon . Resuming its advance that evening , it reached the head of the division late at night . Div Cav guarded the eastern flank the following day , with orders not to attack substantial German forces . The advance towards Sousse resumed on 10 April , with A and B Squadrons reaching El <unk> . The regiment , pursuing the retreating Germans at dawn , was past Sousse by 08 : 30 . As A Squadron advanced up the main road , B and C Squadrons swung west . The regiment was within 10 mi ( 16 km ) of Enfidaville by 13 April and probed the German positions until the 19th . 
 Div Cav was withdrawn on 24 April and was sent back to a rest area two days later . The regiment moved forward west of Enfidaville on 4 May , moving near the town on 8 May , to exploit a breakthrough by tanks the following day . The breakthrough was forestalled by the First Army drive across Tunisia and the Axis forces in North Africa surrendered on 13 May . Three days later , the regiment began moving back to Maadi , arriving on 1 June . At Maadi the regiment received replacements while a number of personnel , who had served with the first three echelons , received three @-@ month leaves in New Zealand . On 5 July , new personal weapons were issued and the regiment began training on the rifle and light machine gun ranges . A month later the first <unk> armoured cars arrived , the regiment being was one of the first units equipped with the vehicle . Five troops in each squadron received <unk> and one troop in each was equipped with a Daimler Dingo Scout Car . On 17 September , the regiment moved to Burg el Arab and began embarking for Italy . By 1 November its equipment had arrived and the regiment moved up to Altamura . 
 = = Italy = = 
 After the Allied invasion of Italy in early September , the Eighth Army advanced rapidly . By the middle of October the army was on the line of Termoli , <unk> and <unk> . German resistance had stiffened in the last stages of the advance . The Fifth Army captured Naples on 1 October and then crossed the Volturno against strong German resistance . By this point the Allies had run up against the fortifications of the Winter Line . The 15th Army Group commander Harold Alexander revised the plan for the winter , which involved the capture of the high ground north of Pescara after crossing the Trigno , Sangro and Pescara rivers . The Fifth Army would advance up the Liri Valley and when both armies were close to Rome , an amphibious operation would be launched south of the Tiber . To prepare for the offensive , the Allies advanced through the outlying Winter Line defences . The Eighth Army crossed the Trigno in late October and Montgomery planned to advance along the coast road to Pescara , which was the most defended route . Montgomery considered his four infantry divisions too weak to break the line without reinforcement . 
 Div Cav became part of the Eighth Army reserve along with the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division and was positioned several miles north of Lucera , near the Foggia Airfield Complex , on 4 November . On 12 November , the regiment left Lucera for the front , arriving at <unk> in the afternoon to guard a bridge over the <unk> River below the village of <unk> . At 09 : 00 the next day , the regiment moved out to its new position , 20 mi ( 32 km ) forward ; the trip taking all day , through sleet and mountainous terrain . A Squadron guarded the bridge , while the rest of the regiment bivouacked . On 18 November , B Squadron guarded the left flank of the division , south @-@ west of <unk> . C and HQ Squadrons advanced 10 mi ( 16 km ) forward , to the village of Monte Marconi , on 20 November and A and B Squadrons were sent back to <unk> <unk> in reserve . C Squadron made contact with the British V Corps on foot , since the road was demolished in three places . 
 = = = Advance across the Sangro = = = 
 In the planned offensive on the Sangro , C Squadron was to follow the 19th Armoured Regiment in its advance at 03 : 00 . Although its tanks reached the river , they bogged in the mud and the squadron remained on the other bank as B Squadron advanced to Monte Marconi . Three troops from C Squadron finally crossed the river by the afternoon of 29 November ; one was ordered to advance to Elici and a second was to make contact with the 8th Indian Infantry Division at La <unk> . The routes were mined and the troops spent the night at 23rd Battalion headquarters . In the morning , the mines were cleared and the second troop contacted the Indians and advanced east of Elici ; the first troop was held up by shelling south of Elici . 
 Three troops from B Squadron tried to probe <unk> but failed since the bridges over the river had been destroyed and a foot patrol formed from the squadron was sent . C Squadron advanced forward of Elici after it was abandoned by the Axis . The New Zealand Engineers constructed a Bailey bridge over the river , allowing B Squadron to cross on 1 December . The squadron attempted to capture <unk> the next day but was repulsed by anti @-@ tank gunfire . Two troops from C Squadron entered <unk> , joining the tanks of the 18th Armoured Regiment . On 4 December , A and B Squadrons attempted to find a way through <unk> , working to the right for an easier approach towards Arielli . The division was to attack on the Orsogna road and contain the 26th Panzer Division . On 1 January 1944 , B Squadron was sent forward as infantry to take over the sector between San <unk> and <unk> . It was relieved on 19 January and the regiment moved back over the Sangro to another sector . 
 = = = Battle of Monte Cassino = = = 
 To divert German troops from the Anzio landings ( Operation Shingle ) , the Fifth Army was ordered to advance towards Cassino and Frosinone before 22 January , D @-@ Day for the operation . To provide a reserve for the army group , the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn to the Naples area . The division became part of the ad hoc New Zealand Corps after its reinforcement by the 4th Indian Division and the regiment was posted above the Volturno River around the village of <unk> . Arriving on 22 January , it moved forward to an assembly area at Stazione di Toro on 6 February . The Fifth Army advance had stalled and the 2nd New Zealand Division moved into the line . Three days later the regiment replaced the 21st Battalion on the Gari river , opposite Sant 'Angelo . On 15 February , the Benedictine monastery on Monte Cassino was bombed and two days later the Maori Battalion attacked the Cassino railway station . There was only enough space for a two @-@ company advance , so Divisional Cavalry and 24th Battalion machine @-@ gunned and mortared the area to their front to create the impression of a larger attack . The regiment laid down a mortar barrage on its front to screen the Maoris with smoke . The Maori Battalion advanced to the railway station but was forced back over the Rapido in the late afternoon . Div Cav moved out of the line to Monte <unk> on 23 February and was relieved by the 1st Battalion , East Surrey Regiment from the British 78th Division . On 15 March , the Monte Cassino assault resumed , and C Squadron kept the Route 6 bridge over the Gari @-@ Rapido shrouded from German observation with smoke . The regiment pulled out of the line on 20 March , taking up the new left flank of New Zealand Division along the Gari River and was relieved on 9 April by the 22nd Battalion . 
 Div Cav rested near <unk> and <unk> . Two troops from C Squadron were positioned along the Venafro – Atina road and the rest of the regiment built the road between <unk> and <unk> . On 18 April , Bonifant left for New Zealand on furlough and was replaced by his second @-@ in @-@ command , Major Nicholas Wilder . On 10 May , the final offensive against the Gustav Line began ; the regiment was combined with the 22nd and 24th Battalions and No. 2 Company of the 27th Machine Gun Battalion to become Pleasants Force , to take over positions held by the Kimberley Rifles . On the night of 11 May , the final battle for Monte Cassino began . The French Expeditionary Corps outflanked the German defences in an advance along the <unk> Mountains . The 78th Infantry Division advanced to Route 6 and on the right of the Eighth Army the II Polish Corps captured Monte Cassino . The Gustav Line was soon broken through and Allied troops in the Anzio beachhead conducted a breakout . By 26 May , the Axis was retreating ; the regiment retrieved its vehicles and drove up the valley to Atina , passing through during the evening before it was stopped by opposition at Vicalvi . Three days later Vicalvi was captured by the 21st Battalion and the regiment advanced through the town . Since the bridge over the <unk> River had been destroyed , B Squadron guarded the site while two troops found their way across and provided a flank guard for the Maori Battalion . C Squadron remained in Vicalvi on 31 May and A Squadron held Posta until it was replaced by the RAF Regiment . B Squadron moved up to Sora when the bridge was completed . On 1 June , B Squadron advanced toward Isola del Liri , which was captured by the 8th Indian Infantry Division . A Squadron was transferred to the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade to advance with it in pursuit , while the rest of the regiment laagered on the <unk> . Allied troops rapidly advanced and Rome was captured on 4 June . 
 = = = Advance to Florence = = = 
 On 5 June , the main part of the regiment was combined with two companies of infantry and a squadron of tanks to form Wilder Force , which was to take over the front from the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade . A Squadron pushed up the valley and Wilder Force advanced behind , through <unk> . After the Axis retreated to their next line of defence , the New Zealand Division withdrew to Arce for training . The regiment moved forward again on 10 July , advancing to Cortona from 11 – 12 July . B Squadron was transferred to 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigade and sent forward to Castiglion Fiorentino to clear the road between Castiglion and Palazzo del Pero . The road was opened by the 6th Armoured Division , and the crossroads on Route 73 was reached on 15 July . The New Zealand Division moved to capture Florence ; the regiment advanced west to Siena and then turned north to Castellina . A Squadron supported the 23rd and 28th Battalions advancing on San <unk> and the remainder of the regiment arrived at San Donato by 22 July . Two days later , C Squadron combined with A Squadron of the 19th Armoured Brigade , No. 2 Company of the 22nd Battalion and 1st Troop of the 31st Anti @-@ tank Battery to form <unk> . The force advanced on 25 July , taking <unk> and advancing toward <unk> . <unk> was taken despite determined opposition the next day and the other two squadrons supported the Maori Battalion . <unk> was disbanded on 27 July and C Squadron remained under the command of the 4th Armoured Brigade . 
 San <unk> was captured shortly afterwards and the final assault on Florence began on 1 August . A Squadron was in reserve and B Squadron patrolled northward . C Squadron advanced on Geppetto , covering the left flank of the 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigade . Geppetto was captured the next morning and C Squadron patrolled forward to San Michele . B Squadron advanced with the Maori Battalion , ending the day and advancing the next morning with that unit . C Squadron moved west on Route 67 until it was halted by opposition near <unk> and A Squadron advanced to <unk> in the afternoon as Florence fell . 
 = = = Gothic Line = = = 
 The New Zealand Division was temporarily relieved and to cover its replacement by the US Fifth Army , B Squadron was attached to the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade , C Squadron to the 5th New Zealand Infantry and A Squadron to the 6th New Zealand Infantry . On the morning of 11 August , C Squadron supported the 23rd Battalion advance from <unk> to the Arno River . B Squadron was positioned in San Vito and A Squadron behind the Pesa River . The regiment withdrew to the divisional area near Castellina on 16 August , moving with the division to <unk> on the Adriatic . Arriving on 29 August , it was transferred to Fano on 5 September . The regiment moved back into the line on 22 September at Rimini , advancing along Route 16 towards Ravenna . On 29 September , all armoured cars were recalled due to heavy rain and poor visibility . Wilder Force was re @-@ formed on 3 October from the dismounted regiment and a machine @-@ gun platoon and it began crossing the Fiumicino River on 15 October . Four days later , Wilder Force was dissolved and the regiment returned to its vehicles . On 21 October , B and C Squadrons attempted to secure the area around <unk> and were within a mile of the town by the end of the day . Since it was strongly held by the Axis , the 22nd Battalion came forward and the squadrons withdrew . 
 Div Cav withdrew to <unk> near San Severino , 60 mi ( 97 km ) in the rear . The regiment was converted to a standard infantry battalion , since its light armoured vehicles were considered unsuited to Italian terrain and the division was short of infantry . The battalion retained the title of Squadron for its company @-@ size units , spent a month retraining as infantry and left <unk> on 24 November . The New Zealand Division was placed under the command of V Corps for the crossing of the Lamone river and the capture of Faenza . The regiment became part of the 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigade , operating in the sector facing the Lamone opposite Faenza and the brigade 's small front was held by the 26th Battalion . The 24th and 25th Battalions were scheduled to replace the 26th next , with Div Cav replacing them . The regiment camped in Forlì before taking over its positions on 2 December . The division mounted a simulated attack to support the British 46th Division crossing of the Lamone with an artillery barrage and tank fire . After the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade moved south to take over the 46th Division positions , the 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigade moved west to take over the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade sector and the regiment was now opposite Faenza . A and B Squadrons moved to the rear , after being relieved by the British 4th Reconnaissance Regiment and C Squadron laid smoke to cover the 13 December crossing of the Lamone by 4th Brigade tanks . The attack on Faenza began the next day and the Maori and 23rd Battalions were at their objectives by 15 December but Axis holdouts continued to resist in the town . The regiment entered Faenza in the afternoon and camped there until 27 December , when it replaced 26th Battalion on the Senio . During the night of 1 / 2 January 1945 , the Maori Battalion relieved the regiment , which moved to Forlì . Div Cav returned to the front after a week and took up the positions of the 25th Battalion , which it fortified against a possible German counter @-@ attack . Alexander decided to wait for early spring to advance to the Po and the regiment settled into static positional warfare . The regiment was relieved by the 25th Battalion on 21 January and returned to Forlì . 
 = = = Spring 1945 offensive in Italy = = = 
 During the final Allied offensive in Italy , the regiment was assigned to the new 9th New Zealand Infantry Brigade , which was allocated as the divisional reserve in April for Operation Buckland . Initially , the regiment protected the engineers bridging the Senio . When the bridges were finished , it covered the open flank around <unk> resulting from a delay to the 3rd Carpathian Division . The regiment then attacked Massa <unk> in preparation for a crossing of the Sillaro river , boarding Kangaroo APCs and moving forward . Tiger tanks forced the regiment to dismount and dig in before the Tigers were knocked out by Allied artillery . A and C Squadrons supported the 22nd Battalion in attacking <unk> . The regiment reached the Sillaro River , crossed it at first light and was relieved by the 27th Battalion on 15 April . D Squadron cleared <unk> <unk> of Axis troops , with A and B Squadrons protecting the left flank . From 16 – 17 April , the regiment protected the right flank behind the 22nd Battalion . The attack across the Gaiana began with a massive artillery barrage during the night of 18 April . Although the regiment crossed the river unopposed , it was counter @-@ attacked beyond the barrage area . Advancing against stiff Axis resistance , A and C Squadrons were on the far side of the <unk> Canal by 01 : 30 on 19 April . The regiment dug in there , resisting Axis counter @-@ attacks ; eleven men from the regiment were killed and 47 wounded . 
 Relieved by the 23rd Battalion , Div Cav was moved back to Medicina . After two days of rest there , the brigade returned to the front lines behind the Allied advance towards the Po river . The regiment was 7 mi ( 11 km ) north of Bologna by the first night back , when it was bombed by an Axis aircraft which wounded four men . Next day the regiment was on the banks of the Reno river and crossed the Po after the rest of the brigade on 26 April . After its advance was stopped by the <unk> Canal , the regiment moved east to <unk> . A and C Squadrons cleared <unk> of the Axis rearguard , taking fifty prisoners . The regiment bypassed scattered German units , racing for Padua during the night . It reached Padua around midnight and was greeted by jubilant Italian crowds . On 29 April a shell struck regimental headquarters , wounding Lieutenant Colonel Wilder and killing two men ( the last men killed in action during the war ) . Wilder was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Victor Tanner ; the regiment advanced again at midday on Route 11 towards Venice , encountering its last strong German resistance in Mira . No. 12 Troop flanked the German positions , capturing 140 men and killing about 20 . The regiment raced on , changing to Route 14 , headed for Trieste and was ferried over the Piave on 30 April ; it was at Monfalcone , controlled by Yugoslav partisans , by the end of 1 May . Trieste was reached the next day and the regiment camped just beyond the city . Div Cav was relieved on 6 May by a battalion of the 363rd Infantry Regiment of the US 91st Division , and moved to <unk> .

 After the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945 , the New Zealand government agreed to contribute units to a joint British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) . The 9th New Zealand Infantry Brigade – including Div Cav , which regained its identity as a regiment – became part of the NZ contingent , known as J Force . In October , a new D Squadron composed of Maori soldiers was added to the regiment . The regiment embarked for Kure on 21 February 1946 , reaching its destination on 19 March and relieving the 67th Australian Battalion on Eta @-@ Jima on 23 March ; it was billeted in Naval Academy Etajima . After patrolling the island , the regiment was replaced by the Royal Welch Fusiliers and moved to Hirao . By May its permanent headquarters was at the <unk> naval barracks . Lieutenant Colonel John <unk> took command on 28 June 1946 and he regimental flag was lowered for the last time on 5 August 1947 ; the regiment was disbanded on 1 September 1947 .

 The Orange Box received critical acclaim , with Portal being recognized as a surprise favorite of the package . The PlayStation 3 version of The Orange Box was noted for several technical shortcomings that were not present in the other versions , only a few of which were fixed through a single patch . 
 = = Overview = = 
 The Orange Box features five complete games compiled into one retail unit : Half @-@ Life 2 and its two continuations , Episode One and Episode Two ; Portal ; and Team Fortress 2 . All of these games use Valve 's Source engine . 
 Through the Steam platform for the Windows version , the games can collect and report in @-@ depth data such as where the player 's character died , completion time , and total victories in multiplayer modes . This data is compiled to generate gameplay statistics for Episode One , Episode Two , and Team Fortress 2 . 
 Although Half @-@ Life 2 has the largest proportion of Achievements , there are 99 spread across all five games , exceeding the 50 @-@ Achievement limit that Microsoft maintains to feature the most Achievements of any Xbox 360 product . These Achievements include killing a certain number of monsters , finding hidden weapon caches , or other tasks specific to each game . 
 All the games except Half @-@ Life 2 contain in @-@ game commentary that can be enabled , allowing the player to listen to the developers discuss the creation and purpose of particular sections and components of each game . This has been a feature of every Valve game since Half @-@ Life 2 : Lost Coast due to the commentary 's popularity in that game , according to Erik Wolpaw , lead writer for Portal . 
 = = = Half @-@ Life 2 = = = 
 Half @-@ Life 2 is a science fiction first @-@ person shooter game and the sequel to Half @-@ Life . While remaining similar in style to the original , Half @-@ Life 2 introduces new concepts to the series such as physics @-@ based puzzles and vehicle sections . The game takes place in the fictional City 17 and surrounding areas as the player takes on the role of scientist Gordon Freeman . Freeman is thrust into a dystopian environment in which the aftermath of the events of Half @-@ Life have come to bear fully upon human society , and he is forced to fight against increasingly unfavorable odds in order to survive . In his struggle , he is joined by various acquaintances , including former Black Mesa colleagues , oppressed citizens of City 17 , and the Vortigaunts , all of whom later prove to be valuable allies . Half @-@ Life 2 received critical acclaim , including 35 Game of the Year awards , when it was originally released for Windows in 2004 . As of December 3 , 2008 , over 6 @.@ 5 million copies of Half @-@ Life 2 have been sold at retail . Although Steam sales figures are unknown , their rate surpassed retail 's in mid @-@ 2008 and they are significantly more profitable per @-@ unit .

 Half @-@ Life 2 : Episode One continues from the events of Half @-@ Life 2 . Episode One builds on the original , adding cooperative play with friendly non @-@ player characters such as Alyx Vance , whose new abilities complement Freeman 's abilities and allow her to comprehend and respond to the player 's actions by lending help . It is set immediately after the end of Half @-@ Life 2 in the war @-@ torn City 17 and nearby areas . Episode One follows scientist Gordon Freeman and his companion Alyx Vance as they continue to cope with the events chronicled in Half @-@ Life 2 and humanity 's continuing struggle against the Combine . The game was originally released in 2006 for Windows as a standalone game and was generally well received .

 Half @-@ Life 2 : Episode Two was first available as part of The Orange Box and focuses on expansive environments , travel , and less linear play . In the game , Gordon Freeman and the series ' other major characters move away from City 17 to the surrounding wilderness following the closing events of Episode One . The game was praised for its new environments and features and was well received by critics . 
 = = = Portal = = = 
 Portal is a single @-@ player first @-@ person action / puzzle game that was first available as part of The Orange Box . The game consists primarily of a series of puzzles that are solved by creating portals through which the player and simple objects can use the portals in order to reach an exit point while being ordered by an AI @-@ programmed robot named GLaDOS throughout the game . The portal system and the unusual physics it creates are the emphasis of this game . Portal was a surprise favorite of The Orange Box , receiving widespread praise and several Game of the Year awards . 
 = = = Team Fortress 2 = = = 
 Team Fortress 2 is a multiplayer team @-@ based first @-@ person shooter that was first available as part of The Orange Box . The game is a sequel to the original Quake modification , Team Fortress , and Valve 's Half @-@ Life modification , Team Fortress Classic . Its focus is on two competing teams that attack each other in order to achieve varying objectives , including capturing control points or defending them from attack , or capturing a flag . Players can choose to play as one of nine classes in these teams , each with different strengths and weaknesses . Unlike most other Source @-@ powered games , Team Fortress 2 features a cartoon art style and non @-@ realistic graphics . Team Fortress 2 was very well received by critics ; it was particularly praised for its unique artistic direction and graphics . It is the only multiplayer game to appear in the collection . The Xbox 360 version has not received any updates since July 21 , 2009 and the PlayStation 3 version received no updates at all , both missing out on most of the PC exclusive content such as item drops , custom <unk> , new gamemodes , cosmetics , new weapons , and trading .

 = = = The Black Box = = = 
 Valve planned on releasing an additional compilation for Windows entitled The Black Box , which would have contained only the new material — Episode Two , Portal , and Team Fortress 2 . The Black Box was later cancelled for retail and is now only available through Steam exclusively to owners of certain ATI graphics cards , who received a voucher for a free copy of The Black Box . 
 During development , the simultaneous release of two game compilation packages with different content combinations was touted by Valve as a new direction for the game industry . Gabe Newell , co @-@ founder of Valve , said , " The Black Box and The Orange Box represent a new approach to publishing multiple products on multiple platforms . " After first discontinuing The Black Box , however , Valve released all the new material for individual download via Steam . 
 The Black Box was to be priced US $ 10 lower than The Orange Box . To compensate for the cancellation of The Black Box , Valve offered gift subscriptions to Steam users who had previously purchased Half @-@ Life 2 or Half @-@ Life 2 : Episode One and then purchased The Orange Box so that they could give their second copies of those two games as gifts to people added to their Steam Friends list . Still , the cancellation of The Black Box sparked complaints from game critics and consumers alike , unhappy that they were obliged to pay for games that they already owned . It also raised concerns among those who had bought the ATI Radeon HD 2900 XT graphics card , which came with a voucher for The Black Box , but Valve clarified that only the retail version of The Black Box had been cancelled . While Valve never expressed its reasons for this decision , industry writers speculated that it might have been to increase profits on retail copies or to avoid customer confusion between similar game packages and their availability across the platforms . 
 = = = PlayStation 3 version = = = 
 While the Windows and Xbox 360 versions of The Orange Box were developed and published by Valve , the development of the PlayStation 3 port was outsourced to Electronic Arts . In an interview with Edge magazine before the game 's release , Valve co @-@ founder Gabe Newell commented , " I think the people who have The Orange Box on the PS3 are going to be happy with their game experience . We 've done the PC and 360 versions here and EA has a team doing the PS3 version – and they 'll make the PS3 version a good product ; EA got the job done in putting a lot of people with PS3 experience on the project . But I think it 's harder to get it to the same standard as the 360 and PC versions " . Despite this , he noted that Valve will probably handle PlayStation 3 versions of its products in the future . 
 In a preview of The Orange Box in November 2007 , 1UP.com revealed numerous problems with the late beta build of EA 's PlayStation 3 version of The Orange Box , citing pervasive frame rate issues which , they claimed , " at best merely hinder gameplay and at worst make the experience downright unplayable . " IGN 's Hilary Goldstein disagreed , writing that although EA " is one of the worst offenders when it comes to porting games to the PS3 , " the frame rate issues were not bad enough " to make me throw my controller in disgust . " 
 On January 3 , 2008 , IGN reported that Valve employees had created a thread on Valve 's website forums for players to list the problems they had encountered and to suggest fixes , which caused speculation that a patch was being planned to address the issues in the PlayStation 3 version , such as the frame rate issues , the connection problems in Team Fortress 2 , and the slow loading times in Portal . A patch for the PlayStation 3 version was later released in North America on March 19 , 2008 and in Europe a short while after that ; however , it made no mention of fixing frame rate issues or slow loading times . 
 = = = Region @-@ specific versions = = = 
 Valve deactivated accounts with CD keys that were purchased outside of the consumer 's territory in order to maintain the integrity of region @-@ specific licensing . This generated complaints from North American customers who had circumvented their Steam end @-@ user license agreement by purchasing The Orange Box through cheaper , Asian retailers . Some customers who then purchased the game a second time from a local vendor experienced difficulty adding the new CD key to their accounts in order to activate their newly purchased games and also had trouble communicating with Steam 's customer support team about this problem . Doug Lombardi of Valve stated , " Some of these users have subsequently purchased a legal copy after realizing the issue and were having difficulty removing the illegitimate keys from their Steam accounts . Anyone having this problem should contact Steam Support to have the Thai key removed from their Steam account . " 
 The German version of The Orange Box is set to a low violence mode in order to comply with German laws regulating the sale of violent video games . Blood effects are replaced by sparks and bullet wounds are replaced with dents as if the characters were metal robots . Additionally in Team Fortress 2 , instead of body parts ' being scattered after a player 's character is blown apart , various items such as hamburgers , coils , rubber ducks , and <unk> Teeth appear ( known as " <unk> " by the community ) . Characters from different classes leave different items and different ratios of these items when killed by explosives . In the Half @-@ Life games , bodies fade away after the death of non @-@ player characters and the blood has been altered to a gray color .

 The soundtrack for The Orange Box consists of music that Valve employees composed for Half @-@ Life 2 : Episode One , Half @-@ Life 2 : Episode Two , Portal , and Team Fortress 2 . It also includes the original version and an exclusive remix of " Still Alive " , both by Jonathan Coulton . It was released on December 21 , 2007 and is sold by the official Valve Store , Amazon.com , and digital music services such as iTunes , Napster , and eMusic . A more @-@ complete version of this soundtrack that also includes music files from Half @-@ Life and Half @-@ Life 2 was released on Steam as part of the Audiosurf package . " Still Alive " was subsequently released as a free downloadable song for the rhythm game Rock Band on March 31 , 2008 .

 The Orange Box was met with universal acclaim from reviewers . The averaging website GameRankings cites both the Xbox 360 version and the PC version as the highest @-@ rated game of their respective platforms . IGN described The Orange Box as " the best deal in video game history , " and awarded both the Windows and Xbox 360 versions with an Editors ' Choice Award . All three versions won GameSpot 's Editors ' Choice Award . Approximately 3 million copies of The Orange Box were sold by the end of November 2008 . 
 Portal was singled out for praise by reviewers . Official Xbox Magazine admired its unique puzzle gameplay mechanics , stating that it was the first major advance in puzzle gaming " since Russians started dropping blocks . " Ben " Yahtzee " Croshaw , The Escapist 's usually <unk> critical reviewer , stated in his Zero Punctuation review that he couldn 't think of any criticism for Portal , which has " some of the funniest pitch @-@ black humor [ he had ] ever heard in a game " and concluded that it is " absolutely sublime from start to finish , and I will jam forks into my eyes if I ever use those words to describe anything else , ever again . " 
 The PlayStation 3 version 's critical review scores suffered because of the technical issues first uncovered by 1UP.com. While discussing the retail version on a podcast , 1UP.com staff members agreed that a significant number of the frame rate problems had been resolved , but not all of them . They concluded that the PlayStation 3 version was not quite as smooth as the Xbox 360 version and recommended that " if you own both [ consoles ] , you should do the 360 " version . Kotaku 's Michael McWhertor echoed that recommendation , though stated that those who only have a PlayStation 3 should still consider The Orange Box . 
 While frame rate issues were the main complaint , the PlayStation 3 version was also criticized for unreliable voice chat and excessive network delay or lag in Team Fortress 2 , as well as long load times generally . It was , however , praised for featuring anti @-@ aliasing and a quick @-@ save feature , neither of which were present in the Xbox 360 version ( but were present in the PC version ) . After release , the game received further criticism from fans for the lack of surround sound support when using an optical cable . An open letter to Valve , asking them to put pressure on EA to release a fix was posted to the Steam forum . A response was posted by a Valve employee going by the name of " <unk> " , directing disappointed customers to a dedicated thread on the subject .

 = Grotesque ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Grotesque " is the fourteenth episode of the third season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files and the show 's 63rd episode overall . It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on February 2 , 1996 . It was written by Howard Gordon and directed by Kim Manners . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Grotesque " earned a Nielsen household rating of 11 @.@ 6 , being watched by 18 @.@ 32 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received mostly positive reviews from television critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Mulder and Scully investigate a serial killer who claims a gargoyle spirit committed the crimes . When Mulder joins the case , his obsession with solving it causes Scully to question his sanity . 
 Gordon was inspired to write the episode after walking down the streets of New York and seeing several stone gargoyles on the corner , staring at him . Gordon developed the concept with series creator Chris Carter , who suggested the addition of more psychological aspects to the episode . Originally , the teaser was planned to be filmed at a Catholic hospital , but the shot was relocated to the site of a historic post office after concerns were raised about attaching a fake gargoyle to the building . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At George Washington University , a group of artists sketch a nude male model . However , one of the artists , John Mostow ( Levani Outchaneichvili ) , draws a demonic creature in the model 's place ; while using a utility knife to sharpen his pencil he cuts his hand trying and smears the blood on his drawing . When the model reaches his car after the session , he is attacked and killed by an obscured assailant . The following morning , Mostow is arrested in his apartment by an FBI task force led by Agent Bill Patterson ( Kurtwood Smith ) , who finds the utility knife used in the murder covered in blood . 
 Mostow , an immigrant from Uzbekistan with a history of involuntary commitment , is charged with killing seven men by mutilating their faces . Agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) become involved in the investigation when Mostow insists that he was possessed during the killings ; his claims are given credence when another murder occurs after his arrest . Mostow draws a gargoyle and claims it made him kill . Mulder meets with Patterson , his former mentor , who has spent three years on the case . The relationship between the two is tense , and Patterson is skeptical of Mulder 's theories . Mulder and Scully go to Mostow 's studio and discover a hidden room full of gargoyle sculptures , finding corpses within them . 
 A glassblower is attacked and hospitalized . Nemhauser ( Greg <unk> ) , another agent on the case , tells Scully that Patterson was responsible for getting Mulder assigned to the case and may admire him after all . Patterson finds Mulder in the library studying gargoyles ; he tells Mulder that he 's wasting his time and is a disappointment to him . Scully goes to Mulder 's apartment and finds it covered with gargoyle drawings . Mulder , having sculpted a gargoyle himself in Mostow 's studio before falling asleep , awakens to find a figure with a gargoyle @-@ like face standing over him ; he gives chase but is attacked , his face slashed with a utility knife . Mulder refuses to explain to Scully why he was in Mostow 's studio . Scully confronts Patterson , who tells her not to try and stop Mulder from doing what he 's doing , because she won 't be able to . Mulder goes to see Mostow again , but Mostow will not tell him how to find the creature that attacked him . 
 Scully finds a disassembled utility knife at the latest crime scene with Mulder 's prints on it and discovers that the murder weapon is missing from the evidence room . She meets with Assistant Director Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) , who is also worried about Mulder 's behavior . Mulder has a nightmare about being attacked by a gargoyle that is really himself . He wakes up and goes to Mostow 's studio again , finding a severed arm . Scully gets a message to call Nemhauser , but his phone is answered by Mulder , who denies taking the knife . Mulder searches Mostow 's studio and finds Nemhauser 's body inside a new sculpture . Mulder is then confronted by Patterson , who is unaware of how he arrived at the studio . Mulder then deduces that Patterson is the killer , based on his three @-@ year obsession with Mostow and his request for Mulder to investigate the case . Mulder confronts him , but Patterson flees when Scully arrives . Mulder pursues him and they fight ; Patterson is shot and apprehended . 
 In the last scene , Patterson is pressed against the bars of his cell , screaming and pleading that he is innocent , while the camera focuses on a gargoyle drawn in blood on the wall of his cell . Earlier in the episode , Mulder told Scully that he and Patterson disagreed on the best way to investigate serial murders , and Patterson always tried to empathize with the suspect , imagining himself in the killer 's place . Mulder 's closing narration concludes that it was this that eventually drove Patterson insane . 
 = = Production = = 
 Writer Howard Gordon conceived the idea for the episode while he was walking down the streets of New York and noticed several stone gargoyles on the corner staring at him . Gordon developed the idea into an X @-@ File involving possession by a gargoyle spirit . He wrote a draft script for the episode but had to turn to series creator Chris Carter three days before production began in order to rework it . The two worked on the script over the weekend to add more psychological aspects to the episode . Gordon claimed to be very proud of the final product . Assistant Art Director Gary Allen drew the gargoyle sketches used in this episode . 
 The producers originally planned to film the teaser sequence at a Catholic hospital , but the hospital was reluctant to affix a faux gargoyle to the building . Thus , the shot was relocated to Heritage Hall , a noted filming location and former post office in Vancouver . Some last minute scrambling was required when city workmen tore up the sidewalk on the very spot where the producers planned to film the scene . The construction crew reassured the show that the construction would be finished in time for filming . Indeed , the work was finished two hours before shooting of the episode started . Additional exterior shots were filmed at an alley near Bonanza Meat Market . The walls were painted to match those of Heritage Hall , although after filming was completed , they were returned to their original state . 
 Kim Manners called " Grotesque " his favorite third season episode and praised David Duchovny 's performance on this episode , saying " Duchovny drove himself , and he was brilliant in that show . " Manners also said of the episode : " I think ' Grotesque ' is a frightening show . I think it is a disturbing show , and I think that 's why — for me — it 's such a good show . We pulled it off making the viewer feel uneasy . I even found it a difficult show to watch . Yeah , it was a pretty dark hour of television and I would like to do more of those . " In order to get a proper feel for the episode , Manners listened to the music from the 1990 film Jacob 's Ladder until his wife " finally asked , ' Do we have to listen to that ( bleeping ) CD again ? ' " Manners also theorized that the episode may have been the template for the show Millennium , which premiered on Fox the following television season .

 " Grotesque " received mostly positive reviews from critics . Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

VanDerWerff wrote , " here 's the thing : ' Grotesque ' is absolutely [ ... ] self @-@ serious , just as much as I feared it would be . It also , unquestionably , works . The reason it works is very simple : It 's pretty scary " . Critical Myth 's John Keegan gave the episode a largely positive review , awarding it an 8 out of 10 . He noted , " Overall , this is a solid effort by Howard Gordon . It ’ s good to see some of the methods that earned Mulder his nickname , and the underlying dynamic between Mulder and Scully is very well played . The central premise is vague enough to fall within the confines of the unusual , if not necessarily paranormal , and the supporting cinematography and score rise to the occasion . " Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode five stars out of five , and praised the themes of the episode , writing that , " Because ' Grotesque ' certainly surprises , and shocks , and even appals — this is the closest The X @-@ Files ever gets to staring into the face of insanity .

Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . She referred to the episode as " one of the [ the show 's ] darkest ever " and called it " a triumph for director Manners , cinematographer Bartley , and The X @-@ Files art department .

 = Mephedrone = 
 Mephedrone , also known as 4 @-@ methyl methcathinone ( 4 @-@ MMC ) or 4 @-@ methyl <unk> , is a synthetic stimulant drug of the amphetamine and cathinone classes . Slang names include drone , M @-@ CAT , White Magic and meow meow . It is chemically similar to the cathinone compounds found in the <unk> plant of eastern Africa . It comes in the form of tablets or a powder , which users can swallow , snort or inject , producing similar effects to MDMA , amphetamines and cocaine . 
 In addition to its stimulant effects , mephedrone produces side effects , of which teeth grinding is the most common . The metabolism of mephedrone has been studied in rats and humans and the metabolites can be detected in urine after usage . 
 Mephedrone was first synthesised in 1929 , but did not become widely known until it was rediscovered in 2003 at which point it was legal to produce and possess in many countries . By 2007 , mephedrone was reported to be available for sale on the internet , by 2008 law enforcement agencies had become aware of the compound , and by 2010 , it had been reported in most of Europe , becoming particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom . Mephedrone was first made illegal in Israel in 2008 , followed by Sweden later that year . In 2010 , it was made illegal in many European countries and in December 2010 , the EU ruled it illegal . In Australia , New Zealand and the United States , it is considered an analog of other illegal drugs and can be controlled by laws similar to the US Federal Analog Act . In September 2011 , the US temporarily classified mephedrone as a Schedule I drug , effective October 2011 . This classification was made permanent in July 2012 with the passage of the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act ( <unk> ) . 
 = = Uses = = 
 = = = Recreational = = = 
 Users have reported that mephedrone causes euphoria , stimulation , an enhanced appreciation for music , an elevated mood , decreased hostility , improved mental function and mild sexual stimulation ; these effects are similar to the effects of cocaine , amphetamines and MDMA , and last different amounts of time depending on the way the drug is taken . Of 70 Dutch users of mephedrone , 58 described it as an overall pleasant experience and 12 described it as an unpleasant experience . In a survey of UK users who had previously taken cocaine , most users found it produced a better @-@ quality and longer @-@ lasting high and was less addictive . The users were also asked to compare the " risk " , and they answered that it was equal . A study of users in Northern Ireland found they did not equate the fact that mephedrone was legal with it being safe to use . This was contrary to another study in New Zealand , where users of benzylpiperazine thought that because it was legal , it was safe . 
 = = = Available forms = = = 
 Mephedrone can come in the form of capsules , tablets or white powder that users may swallow , snort , inject , smoke or use rectally . When taken orally , users reported they could feel the effects within 15 – 45 minutes ; when snorted , the effects were felt within minutes and peaked within half an hour . The effects last for between two and three hours when taken orally or nasally , but only half an hour if taken intravenously . It is sometimes sold mixed with <unk> in a product called bubbles in the UK and also mixed with other cathinones , including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 = = = = Purity = = = = 
 One published study that analysed samples of mephedrone bought using the internet in the UK in 2010 found it was racemic ( a mixture of both stereoisomers ) and of high purity . An unpublished study of six samples also ordered off the internet in the UK in 2010 found they contained very few organic impurities . Four products sold in Irish head shops were tested in 2010 and were found to contain between 82 % and 14 % mephedrone , with some products containing benzocaine and caffeine .

 The <unk> reported mephedrone can cause various unintended side effects including : dilated pupils , poor concentration , teeth grinding , problems focusing visually , poor short @-@ term memory , hallucinations , delusions , and erratic behaviour . They noted the most severe effects appear anecdotally to be linked with high doses or prolonged usage , and the effects may be due to users taking other intoxicants at the same time . Other effects users in internet forums have noted include changes in body temperature , increased heart rate , breathing difficulties , loss of appetite , increased sweating , discolouration of extremities , anxiety , paranoia and depression . When snorted , it can also cause nose bleeds and nose burns . A survey conducted by the National Addiction Centre , UK , found 67 % of mephedrone users experienced sweating , 51 % suffered from headaches , 43 % from heart palpitations , 27 % from nausea and 15 % from cold or blue fingers , indicative of vasoconstriction occurring . Doctors at Guy 's Hospital , London reported , of 15 patients they treated after taking mephedrone in 2009 , 53 % were agitated , 40 % had increased heart rates , 20 % had systolic hypertension and 20 % had seizures ; three required treatment with benzodiazepines , predominantly to control their agitation . They reported none of their patients suffered from cold or blue peripheries , contrary to other reports . Nine of the 15 of patients had a Glasgow coma scale ( GCS ) of 15 , indicating they were in a normal mental state , four had a GCS below 8 , but these patients all reported using a central nervous system depressant , most commonly GHB , with mephedrone . The patients also reported <unk> use of a variety of compounds .

Shortly afterwards , the user " developed palpitations , blurred tunnel vision , chest pressure and sweating " . The patient was treated with 1 mg of lorazepam and the sympathomimetic features decreased and the user was discharged within six hours of arrival . One case of serotonin syndrome has been reported , where the patient was already prescribed fluoxetine and olanzapine , and then took 40 tablets containing mephedrone in one night . He was treated with lorazepam and discharged 15 hours after admission . Both enantiomers of methcathinone , which differs only in the lack of the methyl group on the aryl ring when compared to mephedrone , have been shown to be toxic to rat dopamine neurons , and the S @-@ enantiomer was also toxic against serotonin neurons . Simon Gibbons and Mire <unk> of the School of Pharmacy , University of London stated , based on the chemical similarities between methcathinone and mephedrone , " it is highly likely that mephedrone will display neurotoxicity " . However , Brunt and colleagues stated , " extreme caution " should be used when inferring the toxicity of mephedrone from methcathinone , noting some of the toxicity associated with methcathinone is due to manganese impurities related to its synthesis , rather than the compound itself . They concluded more experimental research is needed to investigate the toxicity of mephedrone . 
 Doctors who treated a 15 @-@ year @-@ old female suffering from mephedrone intoxication suggested in The Lancet that , like MDMA , mephedrone may promote serotonin @-@ mediated release of antidiuretic hormone , resulting in <unk> and an altered mental state . In another case , a 19 @-@ year @-@ old male was admitted to hospital suffering from inflammation of the heart , 20 hours after taking one gram of mephedrone . The doctors treating the patient stated it was caused by either a direct toxic effect of mephedrone on the heart muscle , or by an immune response . One case of acquired <unk> , where a patient had " bluish lips and fingers " , has also been reported , after the user snorted one gram of mephedrone . The patient started to recover after arriving at the hospital and it was not necessary to administer any medication .

 In 2008 , an 18 @-@ year @-@ old Swedish woman died in Stockholm after taking mephedrone . The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported the woman went into convulsions and turned blue in the face . Doctors reported she was comatose and suffering from hyponatremia and severe hypokalemia ; the woman died one and a half days after the onset of symptoms . An autopsy showed severe brain swelling . Mephedrone was scheduled to be classified as a " dangerous substance " in Sweden even before the woman 's death at Karolinska University Hospital on 14 December , but the death brought more media attention to the drug . The possession of mephedrone became classified as a criminal offence in Sweden on 15 December 2008 .

 In 2010 , unconfirmed reports speculated about the role mephedrone has played in the deaths of several young people in the UK . By July 2010 , mephedrone had been alleged to be involved in 52 fatalities in the UK , but detected in only 38 of these cases . Of the nine that coroners had finished investigating , two were caused directly by mephedrone . The first death reported to be caused by mephedrone use was that of 46 @-@ year @-@ old , John Sterling Smith , who had underlying health problems and repeatedly injected the drug . A report in Forensic Science International in August 2010 stated mephedrone intoxication has been recorded as the cause of death in two cases in Scotland . Post mortem samples showed the concentration of mephedrone in their blood was 22 mg / L in one case and 3 @.@ 3 mg / L in the other . The death of a teenager in the UK in November 2009 was widely reported as being caused by mephedrone , but a report by the coroner concluded she had died from natural causes . In March 2010 , the deaths of two teenagers in Scunthorpe were widely reported by the media to be caused by mephedrone . Toxicology reports showed the teenagers had not taken any mephedrone and had died as a result of consuming alcohol and the heroin substitute methadone . According to Fiona Measham , a criminologist who is a member of the ACMD , the reporting of the unconfirmed deaths by newspapers followed " the usual cycle of ‘ exaggeration , distortion , inaccuracy and sensationalism ' " associated with the reporting of recreational drug use .

 Mephedrone has been implicated in the death of a 22 @-@ year @-@ old male , who had also injected black tar heroin . Mephedrone was found in his blood at a concentration of 0 @.@ 50 mg / L and in his urine at a concentration of 198 mg / L. The blood concentration of morphine , a metabolite of heroin , was 0 @.@ 06 mg / L. For comparison , the average blood morphine concentration resulting from deadly overdoses involving only heroin is around 0 @.@ 34 mg / L.

 = = = Pharmacodynamics = = = 
 The pharmacology and toxicology of mephedrone had not been studied in detail until well after its sale as a designer drug and its addition to controlled drug lists in many countries . Writing in the British Medical Journal , psychiatrists stated , given its chemical structure , " mephedrone is likely to stimulate the release of , and then inhibit the reuptake of monoamine neurotransmitters " . The cathinone derivatives methcathinone and <unk> act in a similar way to amphetamines , mainly acting on catecholamine transporters , so mephedrone is expected also to act in this way . The actions of amphetamines and cathinones are determined by the differences in how they bind to <unk> , dopamine and serotonin transporters . Molecular modelling of mephedrone suggests it is more hydrophilic than methyl @-@ amphetamines , which may account for the higher doses required to achieve a similar effect , because mephedrone is less able to cross the blood – brain barrier . Mephedrone has a chiral centre , so exists in two forms , called enantiomers ; the S form is thought to be more potent than the R form , because this applies to cathinone . A study by Gregg et al . , determined that the R form is more dopaminergic and rewarding than the S form , in contrast to what is observed with cathinone . 
 Mephedrone is often consumed with alcohol . A study in mice investigated the interrelation between these two substances , focusing on the psychostimulant and rewarding properties of mephedrone . It found that at low ( non stimulant ) doses alcohol significantly enhanced the psychostimulant effects of mephedrone . This effect was mediated by an increase in synaptic dopamine , as haloperidol , but not <unk> , was able to block the potentiation by alcohol . Similarly , the rewarding properties of mephedrone were enhanced by a low non @-@ rewarding dose of alcohol .

 Several articles published near the end of 2011 examined the effects of mephedrone , compared to the similar drugs MDMA and amphetamine in the nucleus accumbens of rats , as well as examining the reinforcing potential of mephedrone . Dopamine and serotonin were collected using <unk> , and increases in dopamine and serotonin were measured using HPLC . Reward and drug seeking are linked to increases in dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens , and drug half @-@ life plays a role in drug seeking , as well . Based on histological examination , most of the author 's probes were in the nucleus accumbens shell . Mephedrone administration caused about a 500 % increase in dopamine , and about a 950 % increase in serotonin . They reached their peak concentrations at 40 minutes and 20 minutes , respectively , and returned to baseline by 120 minutes after injection . In comparison , MDMA caused a roughly 900 % increase in serotonin at 40 minutes , with an insignificant increase in dopamine . Amphetamine administration resulted in about a 400 % increase in dopamine , peaking at 40 minutes , with an insignificant increase in serotonin . Analysis of the ratio of the AUC for dopamine ( DA ) and serotonin ( 5 @-@ HT ) indicated mephedrone was preferentially a serotonin <unk> , with a ratio of 1 @.@ 22 : 1 ( serotonin vs. dopamine ) . Additionally , half @-@ lives for the decrease in DA and 5 @-@ HT were calculated for each drug . Mephedrone had decay rates of 24 @.@ 5 minutes and 25 @.@ 5 minutes , respectively . MDMA had decay values of 302 @.@ 5 minutes and 47 @.@ 9 minutes , respectively , while amphetamine values were 51 minutes and 84 @.@ 1 minutes , respectively . Taken together , these findings show mephedrone induces a massive increase in both DA and 5 @-@ HT , combined with rapid clearance . The rapid rise and subsequent fall of DA levels could explain some of the addictive properties mephedrone displays in some users . 
 = = = = Metabolism = = = = 
 Based on the analysis of rat and human urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry , mephedrone is thought to be metabolised by three phase 1 pathways . It can be <unk> to the primary amine ( producing compounds 2 , 3 and 5 ) , the ketone group can be reduced ( producing 3 ) or the <unk> group can be oxidised ( producing 6 ) . Both 5 and 6 are thought to be further metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide and sulfate derivatives . Knowledge of the primary routes of metabolism should allow the intake of mephedrone to be confirmed by drug tests , as well as more accurate determination of the causes of side effects and potential for toxicity . 
 = = = Detection in body fluids = = = 
 Mephedrone may be quantitated in blood , plasma or urine by gas chromatography @-@ mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography @-@ mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation . Blood or plasma mephedrone concentrations are expected to be in a range of 50 – 100 μg / l in persons using the drug recreationally , > 100 μg / l in intoxicated patients and > 500 μg / l in victims of acute overdosage . 
 = = Physical and chemical properties = = 
 = = = Appearance and odour = = = 
 Mephedrone is a white substance . It is sold most commonly as crystals or a powder , but also in the form of capsules or pills . It can have a distinctive odour , reported to range from a synthetic fishy smell to the smell of vanilla and bleach , stale urine , or electric circuit boards . 
 = = = Synthesis = = = 
 Mephedrone can be synthesised in several ways . The simplest method , due to the availability of the compounds , is to add 4 @-@ <unk> dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine , creating an oil fraction of 4 ' <unk> @-@ 2 @-@ <unk> . The oil fraction can then be dissolved in dichloromethane ( CH2Cl2 ) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2 @-@ containing methylamine hydrochloride and <unk> . Hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2 . The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum , creating an oil which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether . Finally , HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4 @-@ <unk> hydrochloride . This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA . 
 It can also be produced by oxidising the ephedrine analogue 4 @-@ <unk> using potassium permanganate dissolved in sulfuric acid . Because 4 @-@ <unk> can be obtained in a specific enantiomeric form , mephedrone consisting of only one enantiomer can be produced . The danger associated with this method is it may cause manganese poisoning if the product is not correctly purified . 
 A <unk> form of ( S ) <unk> could be prepared via Friedel – Crafts <unk> . The first step in the synthesis would be to react toluene and ( S ) <unk> @-@ <unk> chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride , then <unk> the intermediate with hydrochloric acid @-@ propyl alcohol . This would produce ( S ) -4 @-@ <unk> , which could then be methylated to produce mephedrone .

 Mephedrone does not react with most reagent testing kits . The exception is the <unk> reagent , which gives a bright yellow reaction . 
 = = History = = 
 Mephedrone is one of hundreds of designer drugs or legal highs that have been reported in recent years , including artificial chemicals such as synthetic cannabis and semisynthetic substances such as <unk> . These drugs are primarily developed to avoid being controlled by laws against illegal drugs , thus giving them the label of designer drugs . According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction , the synthesis of mephedrone was first reported in 1929 by <unk> de <unk> Sanchez in the Bulletin de la Société <unk> de France , under the name " <unk> @-@ alpha @-@ <unk> " , but the compound remained an obscure product of academia until 2003 , when it was " re @-@ discovered " and publicised by an underground chemist on The Hive website , working under the pseudonym " Kinetic " . Kinetic posted on the site , " I ’ ve been bored over the last couple of days and had a few fun reagents lying around , so I thought I ’ d try and make some 1- ( 4 @-@ <unk> ) -2 @-@ <unk> hydrochloride , or 4 @-@ <unk> . " before going on to describe that after taking it , the user had a " fantastic sense of well @-@ being that I haven ’ t got from any drug before except my beloved Ecstasy . " In interviews Kinetic was described as " a mathematician who used to design sleeping pills for a major pharmaceutical company " and he stated that he was based in Israel when he rediscovered mephedrone . 
 A drug similar to mephedrone , containing cathinone , was sold legally in Israel from around 2004 , under the name <unk> . When this was made illegal , the cathinone was modified and the new products were sold by the Israeli company , <unk> . The products had names such as <unk> pills , but the range was discontinued in January 2008 after the Israeli government made mephedrone illegal . The <unk> Research Project , an EU organisation that searches the internet for information regarding new drugs , first identified mephedrone in 2008 . Their research suggested the drug first became available to purchase on the internet in 2007 , when it was also discussed on internet forums . Mephedrone was first seized in France in May 2007 , after police sent a tablet they assumed to be ecstasy to be analysed , with the discovery published in a paper titled " Is 4 @-@ <unk> , an " Ecstasy " of the twenty first century ? " Mephedrone was reported as having been sold as ecstasy in the Australian city of Cairns , along with <unk> , in 2008 . An annual survey of regular ecstasy users in Australia in 2010 found 21 % of those surveyed had used mephedrone , with 17 % having done so in the previous six months . The price they paid per gram varied from A $ 16 to $ 320 . 
 Europol noted they became aware of it in 2008 , after it was found in Denmark , Finland and the UK . The Drug Enforcement Administration noted it was present in the United States in July 2009 . By May 2010 , mephedrone had been detected in all 22 EU member states that reported to Europol , as well as in Croatia and Norway . The Daily Telegraph reported in April 2009 that it was manufactured in China , but it has since been made illegal there . In March 2009 , Druglink magazine reported it only cost a " couple of hundred pounds " to synthesise a kilogram of mephedrone , the same month , The Daily Telegraph reported manufacturers were making " huge amounts of money " from selling it . In January 2010 , Druglink magazine reported dealers in Britain spent £ 2 @,@ 500 to ship one kilogram from China , but could sell it for £ 10 a gram , making a profit of £ 7 @,@ 500 . A later report , in March 2010 , stated the wholesale price of mephedrone was £ 4000 per kilogram . 
 In March 2011 , the International Narcotics Control Board published a report about designer drugs , noting mephedrone was by then being used recreationally in Europe , North America , Southeast Asia , New Zealand and Australia .

 Between the summer of 2009 and March 2010 , the use of mephedrone grew rapidly in the UK , with it becoming readily available at music festivals , head shops and on the internet . A survey of Mixmag readers in 2009 , found it was the fourth most popular street drug in the United Kingdom , behind cannabis , cocaine , and ecstasy . The drug was used by a diverse range of social groups . Whilst the evidence was anecdotal , researchers , charity workers , teachers and users reported widespread and increasing use of the drug in 2009 . The drug 's rapid growth in popularity was believed to be related to both its availability and legality . 
 Fiona Measham , a criminologist at The University of Lancaster , thought the emergence of mephedrone was also related to the decreasing purity of ecstasy and cocaine on sale in the UK , a view reinforced in a report by the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse . The average cocaine purity fell from 60 % in 1999 to 22 % in 2009 and about half of ecstasy pills seized in 2009 contained no MDMA , and by June 2010 almost all ecstasy pills seized in the UK contained no MDMA . A similar pattern was observed in the Netherlands , with the number of ecstasy tablets containing no MDMA rising from 10 % in mid @-@ 2008 to 60 % by mid @-@ 2009 , with mephedrone being detected in 20 % of ecstasy tablets by mid @-@ 2009 . The decrease of MDMA was thought to be partly due to the seizure of 33 tonnes of sassafras oil , the precursor to MDMA , in Cambodia in June 2008 , which could have been used to make 245 million doses of MDMA . According to John Ramsey , a toxicologist at St George 's , University of London , the emergence of mephedrone was also related to the UK government banning the benzylpiperazine class of drugs in December 2009 @.@ gamma @-@ <unk> ( GBL ) , another previously " legal high " , was also banned in August 2009 despite concerns it would be replaced by other drugs . 
 By December 2009 mephedrone was available on at least 31 websites based in the UK and by March 2010 there were at least 78 online shops , half of which sold amounts of less than 200 grams and half that also sold bulk quantities . The price per gram varied from £ 9 @.@ 50 to £ 14 . Between July 2009 and February 2010 , UK health professionals accessed the National Poisons Information Service 's ( <unk> ) entry on mephedrone 1664 times and made 157 telephone inquiries ; the requests increased month on month over this period . In comparison , over a similar time period , the entries for cocaine and MDMA were accessed approximately 2400 times . After mephedrone was made illegal the number of inquiries to the <unk> fell substantially , to only 19 in June 2010 . 
 Media organisations including the BBC and The Guardian incorrectly reported mephedrone was commonly used as a plant fertiliser . In fact sellers of the drug described it as " plant food " because it was illegal to sell the compound for human consumption . In late 2009 UK newspapers began referring to the drug as meow or miaow ( sometimes doubled as meow meow or miaow miaow ) , a name that was almost unknown on the street at the time . In November 2009 , the tabloid newspaper , The Sun published a story stating that a man had ripped off his own scrotum whilst using mephedrone . The story was later shown to be an online joke posted on <unk> , later included in a police report with the caveat that it could be unreliable . The police report was used as a source for the story in The Sun . Other myths the media often repeated during 2010 were that mephedrone had led to the deaths of over 20 people , teachers were unable to confiscate the drug from pupils and the government was too slow to ban the drug . Parallels were drawn between the media coverage of mephedrone and a piece of satire by Chris Morris in 1997 on Brass Eye when he tricked public figures into talking of the dangers of taking the fictional legal drug " cake " . The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) have suggested that the media coverage of the drug led to its increased usage . Jon Silverman , a former BBC Home Affairs Correspondent , has written two articles discussing how the media had a strong influence over the UK government 's drugs policy , particularly in that the government wished to demonstrate they were being " tough " on drugs . 
 A survey of 1000 secondary school pupils and university students in Tayside conducted in February 2010 found 20 % of them had previously taken mephedrone . Although at the time it was available legally over the internet , only 10 % of users reported purchasing it online , with most purchasing it from street dealers . Of those who had used mephedrone , 97 % said it was easy or very easy to obtain . Around 50 % of users reported at least one negative effect associated with the use of mephedrone , of which teeth grinding is the most common . Detailed interviews with users in Northern Ireland similarly found that few purchased mephedrone online , with most interviewees citing concerns that their address would be traced or that family members could intercept the package . 
 On 30 March 2010 , Alan Johnson , the then Home Secretary , announced mephedrone would be made illegal " within weeks " after the ACMD sent him a report on the use of cathinones . The legislation would make all cathinones illegal , which Johnson said would " stop unscrupulous manufacturers and others peddling different but similarly harmful drugs " . The ACMD had run into problems with the UK Government in 2009 regarding drugs policy , after the government did not follow the advice of the ACMD to reclassify ecstasy and cannabis , culminating in the dismissal of the ACMD chairman , David Nutt , after he reiterated the ACMD 's findings in an academic lecture . Several members resigned after he was sacked , and prior to the announcement that mephedrone was to be banned , the trend continued when Dr Polly Taylor resigned , saying she " did not have trust " in the way the government would use the advice given by the ACMD . Eric Carlin , a member of the ACMD and former chairman of the English Drug Education Forum , also resigned after the announcement . He said the decision by the Home Secretary was " unduly based on media and political pressure " and there was " little or no discussion about how our recommendation to classify this drug would be likely to impact on young people 's behaviour . " Some former members of the ACMD and various charity groups expressed concern over the banning of the drug , arguing it would inevitably criminalise users , particularly young people . Others expressed concern that the drug would be left in the hands of black market dealers , who will only compound the problem . Carlin 's resignation was specifically linked to the criminalisation of mephedrone , he stated : " We need to review our entire approach to drugs , dumping the idea that legally @-@ sanctioned punishments for drug users should constitute a main part of the armoury in helping to solve our country ’ s drug problems . We need to stop harming people who need help and support " . 
 The parliamentary debate was held on 8 April , one day after the 2010 general election had been announced , meaning it was during the so @-@ called " wash @-@ up period " when legislation is passed with little scrutiny . Only one hour was spent debating the ban and all three parties agreed , meaning no vote was required . In an interview conducted in July 2010 , when he was no longer a minister , Johnson admitted the decision to ban mephedrone was sped up after widespread reporting of deaths caused by the drug , and because the government wished to pass the law before parliament was dissolved prior to the upcoming general election . In January 2011 , however , Johnson told the Scunthorpe Telegraph that the decision was based only on information from the ACMD . An editorial in the April 2010 edition of The Lancet questioned the decision to ban mephedrone , saying the ACMD did not have enough evidence to judge the potential harms caused by mephedrone and arguing that policy makers should have sought to understand why young people took it and how they could be influenced to not take it . Evan Harris , then the Liberal Democrat science spokesman , stated the ACMD " was not ' legally constituted ' " as required by the Misuse of Drugs Act , when the report on cathinones was published , since after Taylor resigned , it lacked a veterinary surgeon . In the rush to make mephedrone illegal , the act that was passed specified the inactive enantiomer of mephedrone , leaving the active form legal until the loophole was closed in February 2011 by another act of parliament . In Chemistry World , John Mann , professor of chemistry at Queen 's University Belfast , suggested the UK create a law similar to the Federal Analog Act of the United States , which would have made mephedrone illegal as an analog of cathinone . In August 2010 , James <unk> , the Home Office drugs minister , announced plans to create a new category in the Misuse of Drugs Act , through the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill , that would allow new legal highs to be made temporarily illegal , without the need for a vote in parliament or advice from the ACMD , as was required to categorise mephedrone . 
 According to the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs , after mephedrone was made illegal , a street trade in the drug emerged , with prices around double those prior to the ban , at £ 20 – £ 25 per gram . In September 2010 , Druglink reported the ban had had a mixed effect on mephedrone use , with it decreasing in some areas , remaining similar in others and becoming more prevalent in some areas . In an online survey of 150 users after the ban , 63 % said they were continuing to use mephedrone , half of those used the same amount and half said they used less . Compared to previous surveys , more users purchased it from dealers , rather than the internet . The average price per gram was £ 16 , compared to around £ 10 before the ban . The 2010 Mixmag survey of 2500 <unk> found one @-@ quarter had used mephedrone in the previous month , the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal , and it was more likely to be cut with other substances . Of those who had already used mephedrone prior to the ban , 75 % had continued to use it after the ban . Of the various drugs used by the survey participants , users were more likely to have concerns about it . Interviews with users in Northern Ireland also found the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal , to around £ 30 a gram . Rather than the price rising due to increased scarcity of the drug , it is thought to have risen for two other reasons . Firstly , dealers knew there was still demand for mephedrone , but were aware the supplies may be exhausted in the future . Secondly , the dealers perceived customers were likely to be willing to pay more for an illegal substance . 
 Professor <unk> Bird , a statistician at the Medical Research Council , suggested the ban of mephedrone may lead to more cocaine @-@ related deaths . In the first six months of 2009 , the number of cocaine @-@ related deaths fell for the first time in four years , and fewer soldiers tested positive for cocaine in 2009 than in 2008 . She suggested this may have been due to users switching to mephedrone from cocaine , but cautioned that before full figures are available for 2009 and 2010 , it will be difficult to determine whether mephedrone saved lives , rather than cost them . Other supposedly legal drugs have filled the gap in the market since mephedrone was made illegal , including <unk> ( NRG @-@ 1 ) ( since made illegal ) and Ivory Wave , which has been found to contain MDPV , a compound made illegal at the same time as mephedrone . However , some products branded as Ivory Wave possibly do not contain MDPV . When tested , some products sold six weeks after mephedrone was banned , advertised as NRG @-@ 1 , NRG @-@ 2 and <unk> , were found to be mephedrone . A <unk> survey of drugs workers at the end of 2012 reported that mephedrone use was still widespread in the UK and that there increasing reports of problematic users . It was being taken as not only a " poor man 's cocaine " but also amongst users of heroin and crack cocaine . Cases of intravenous use were also reported to be on the increase .

 When mephedrone was rediscovered in 2003 , it was not specifically illegal to possess in any country . As its use has increased , many countries have passed legislation making its possession , sale , and manufacture illegal . It was first made illegal in Israel , where it had been found in products such as <unk> pills , in January 2008 . After the death of a young woman in Sweden in December 2008 was linked to the use of mephedrone , it was classified as a hazardous substance a few days later , making it illegal to sell in Sweden . In June 2009 , it was classified as a narcotic with the possession of 15 grams or more resulting in a minimum of two years in prison – a longer sentence , gram for gram than given for the possession of cocaine or heroin . In December 2008 , Denmark also made it illegal and through the Medicines Act of Finland , it was made illegal to possess without a prescription . In November 2009 , it was classified as a " narcotic or psychotropic " substance and added to the list of controlled substances in Estonia and made illegal to import into Guernsey along with other legal highs , before being classified as a Class B drug in April 2010 . It was classified as a Class C drug in Jersey in December 2009 . 
 In 2010 , as its use became more prevalent , many countries passed legislation prohibiting mephedrone . It became illegal in Croatia and Germany in January , followed by Romania and the Isle of Man in February . In March 2010 , it was classified as an unregulated medicine in the Netherlands , making the sale and distribution of it illegal . The importation of mephedrone into the UK was banned on 29 March 2010 . The next day , the ACMD in the UK published a report on the cathinones , including mephedrone , and recommended they be classified as Class B drugs . On 7 April 2010 , the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 ( Amendment ) Order 2010 was passed by parliament , making mephedrone and other substituted cathinones , Class B drugs from 16 April 2010 . Prior to the ban taking effect , mephedrone was not covered by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 . It was , though , an offence under the Medicines Act to sell it for human consumption , so it was often sold as " plant food " or " bath salts " , although it has no use as these products ; this , too , was possibly illegal under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 . In the US , similar descriptions have been used to describe mephedrone , as well as <unk> ( MDPV ) . In May 2010 , the Republic of Ireland made mephedrone illegal , followed by Belgium , Italy , Lithuania , France and Norway in June and Russia in July . In August 2010 , Austria and Poland made it illegal and China announced it would be illegal as of 1 September 2010 . Mephedrone had been reported to be used in Singapore in February 2010 , but it was made illegal in November 2010 . In December 2010 , following the advice of the EMCDDA , mephedrone was made illegal throughout the EU , a move Switzerland also made shortly afterwards . Countries which have not already banned it , such as the Netherlands , Greece and Portugal , will need to change legislation to comply with the EU ruling . In Hungary , a government advisory body recommended mephedrone should be made illegal in August 2010 , which was followed , making it illegal in January 2011 ; Spain followed in February 2011 . Mexico , by Decree , outlawed mephedrone as a substance " with low or no therapeutical use which pose a serious threat to public health " in 2014 . 
 In some countries , mephedrone is not specifically listed as illegal , but is controlled under legislation that makes compounds illegal if they are analogs of drugs already listed . In Australia during 2010 , it was not specifically listed as prohibited , but the Australian Federal Police stated it is an analogue to methcathinone and therefore illegal . It is now listed as a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard ( October 2015 ) . A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused , the manufacture , possession , sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research , or for analytical , teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and / or State or Territory Health Authorities . In February 2010 , 22 men were arrested in connection with importing mephedrone . By January 2011 , every state in Australia , other than Victoria , had listed it as a controlled drug . 
 In New Zealand , it is not included in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 , but is illegal , as it is similar to controlled substances . 
 In Canada , mephedrone is not explicitly listed in any schedule of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act , but " amphetamines , their salts , derivatives , isomers and analogues and salts of derivatives , isomers and analogues " are included in Section 19 of Schedule I of the act . <unk> and methcathinone are listed in separate sections of Schedule III , while <unk> and <unk> ( also cathinones ) , are listed in separate sections of Schedule IV , each without language to capture analogues , isomers , etc . Mephedrone is considered a controlled substance by Health Canada . According to the Canadian Medical Association , mephedrone is grouped with other amphetamines as Schedule I controlled substances . There have been several media reports of the Canadian police seizing mephedrone . Mephedrone is also currently scheduled in the United States as of 2011 . The Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) states , as an analogue of methcathinone , possession of mephedrone can be controlled by the Federal Analog Act , but according to the Los Angeles Times , this only applies if it is sold for human consumption . Several cities and states , such as New York State , have passed legislation to specifically list mephedrone as illegal , but in most areas it remained legal , so long as it is not sold for human consumption , so retailers described it as ' bath salts ' . In September 2011 , The DEA began using its emergency scheduling authority to temporarily control mephedrone . Except as authorized by law , this action made possessing and selling mephedrone or the products that contain it illegal in the US for at least one year while the DEA and the United States Department of Health and Human Services conduct further study . Control of these compounds became permanent on 9 July 2012 , via passage of the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 .

 Professor David Nutt , former chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) in the UK has said , " people are better off taking ecstasy or amphetamines than those [ drugs ] we know nothing about " and " Who knows what 's in [ mephedrone ] when you buy it ? We don 't have a testing system . It could be very dangerous , we just don 't know . These chemicals have never been put into animals , let alone humans . " Les King , a former member of the ACMD , has stated mephedrone appears to be less potent than amphetamine and ecstasy , but that any benefit associated with this could be negated by users taking larger amounts . He also told the BBC , " all we can say is [ mephedrone ] is probably as harmful as ecstasy and amphetamines and wait until we have some better scientific evidence to support that . " 
 = The Stone Tape = 
 The Stone Tape is a television play directed by Peter <unk> and starring Michael Bryant , Jane Asher , Michael Bates and Iain Cuthbertson . It was broadcast on BBC Two as a Christmas ghost story in 1972 . Combining aspects of science fiction and horror , the story concerns a team of scientists who move into their new research facility , a renovated Victorian mansion that has a reputation for being haunted . The team investigate the phenomena , trying to determine if the stones of the building are acting as a recording medium for past events ( the " stone tape " of the play 's title ) . However , their investigations serve only to unleash a darker , more malevolent force . 
 The Stone Tape was written by Nigel Kneale , best known as the writer of Quatermass . Its juxtaposition of science and superstition is a frequent theme in Kneale 's work ; in particular , his 1952 radio play You Must Listen , about a haunted telephone line , is a notable antecedent of The Stone Tape . The play was also inspired by a visit Kneale had paid to the BBC 's research and development department , which is located in an old Victorian house in Kingswood , Surrey . Critically acclaimed at time of broadcast , it remains well regarded to this day as one of Nigel Kneale 's best and most terrifying plays . Since its broadcast , the hypothesis of residual haunting – that ghosts are recordings of past events made by the natural environment – has come to be known as the " Stone Tape Theory " . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 Peter Brock ( Michael Bryant ) is the selfish and petulant head of a research team for Ryan Electrics . His team is developing a new recording medium that will give the company an edge over its Japanese competitors . They move into a new facility at Taskerlands , an old Victorian mansion that has been renovated for their use . On arrival , they learn from estates manager Roy Collinson ( Iain Cuthbertson ) that the refurbishment of one of the rooms in Taskerlands remains uncompleted , the builders having refused to work in it because it is supposedly haunted . The room , with its stone walls , is a remnant of the original building , with foundations dating back to the Saxon era . The rest of the mansion was added on over the centuries . 
 Curious , the researchers explore the room and hear the sounds of a woman running followed by a gut @-@ wrenching scream . Jill Greeley ( Jane Asher ) , an emotionally sensitive computer programmer , has a vision of a woman running up the steps in the room and falling , apparently to her death . 
 Inquiring with the local villagers , they learn that a young maid died in that room during Victorian times and that an unsuccessful exorcism had previously been performed on the property . 
 Brock hypothesises that it is not a ghost , but that somehow the stone in the room has preserved an image of the girl 's death — this " stone tape " may be the new recording medium they have been seeking . Their scientific devices fail to detect any evidence of the phenomena the team experience , and different team members experience different phenomena : most are able to hear sounds , Jill can also see images , but another member of the team experiences no sensory input . Jill hypothesises that the " tape " does not produce actual sound or light , but instead interfaces with the human nervous system during playback to create the sensory impression of sound and vision , and some individuals are more sensitive to this than others . She surmises that the recordings are imprinted in moments of extreme emotion , like a kind of telepathy . 
 Excited by the possibilities presented by a recording medium which uses a person 's own senses as the means of recording and playback , Brock and his team move into the room . They bombard it with their technology , hoping to find the secret of the " stone tape " and have it play on demand . When results are not forthcoming and under mounting pressure to succeed , a last desperate attempt wipes the recording and some team members break under the strain . Brock 's failures are compounded when he is informed by his superiors that they have lost confidence in his work , and that the Taskerlands facility is to be shared with a rival research team working on a new washing machine . 
 Embittered , Brock no longer wants anything to do with the stone tape . He disregards Jill 's insistence that there is still more to learn about the room and her mounting concerns that it is dangerous to stop their research . After studying the failed exorcism , Jill presents the theory that the stone tape can be recorded over again and again , like magnetic recording tape ; the maid 's death was simply the most recent and clearest recording . Independently continuing her research , Jill realizes that the maid 's death was masking a much older recording , left many thousands of years ago . Brock cruelly dismisses her findings , and forces Jill to take a two @-@ month leave to prevent her from continuing her research . 
 Returning to the room one last time , Jill 's senses are besieged by a powerful , malevolent presence from the much @-@ degraded older recording . Like the maid before her , she dies while frantically trying to escape it . 
 During an inquest , Brock tries to save face by denouncing Jill as having been mentally unstable . Afterwards he orders that all of Jill 's research be destroyed without reviewing it . The " haunted " room has been declared of historical importance by a preservation society , prohibiting development , destruction , or commercial use . He makes a final visit to the room and discovers to his horror that the stone tape has made a new , crystal @-@ clear recording — that of Jill screaming his name as she dies .

 Nigel Kneale was a Manx television playwright who had first come to prominence in the 1950s thanks to his three Quatermass serials and his controversial adaptation of George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty @-@ Four , all of which were produced by the BBC . Going freelance in the nineteen @-@ sixties , Kneale had produced scripts for Associated Television and for Hammer Films . In the late nineteen @-@ sixties and early nineteen @-@ seventies , Kneale had been coaxed back to the BBC , writing such plays as The Year of the Sex Olympics , Wine of India and , for the anthology series Out of the Unknown , The Chopper . 
 In the middle of 1972 , Christopher Morahan , who was Head of Drama at BBC2 and who had directed Kneale 's 1963 play The Road and the 1965 remake of Kneale 's adaptation of Nineteen Eighty @-@ Four , approached Kneale asking him to write a play to be broadcast over the Christmas period . Accepting the commission , Kneale quickly decided that , in keeping with Christmas tradition , he would write a ghost story , but with a difference – ancient spirits would come into collision with modern science . The concept of mixing the supernatural with high technology had long been a feature of Kneale 's work – most notably , his 1952 radio play You Must Listen , which concerned a telecommunications engineer who discovers that a telephone line has somehow preserved the final conversation between a woman and her lover before her suicide , was an important antecedent of The Stone Tape . The science and supernatural theme is also present in Kneale 's Quatermass and the Pit which , in addition , shares similar elements with The Stone Tape such as an abandoned house with a reputation for hauntings ; the collection of documentary evidence of the haunting ( also a trademark of M. R. James , a writer much admired by Kneale ) and the sensitivity of certain characters to the supernatural . In addition , the relationship between the scientists and the local villagers echoes that seen in Quatermass II . 
 For the research facility at " Taskerlands " , Kneale was influenced by a visit he had paid to the BBC 's research and development facility which was based at an old country house at Kingswood Warren in Kingswood , Surrey . Similarly , the researchers working at Kingswood Warren influenced the portrayal of the members of the Ryan research team in The Stone Tape . Kneale recalled of his visit to Kingswood Warren , " The sort of impression you got of the folk who worked there was a boyishness . They were very cheerful . It was all rather fun for them , which is a very clever way to go about doing that sort of heavy research ... They were nice chaps – and so we got some very nice chaps for the TV version " . 
 Kneale delivered his script , initially titled Breakthrough and later renamed The Stone Tape , in September 1972 . Because of its subject matter , it was felt that the play would be best handled as an instalment of Dead of Night , a supernatural anthology series produced by Innes Lloyd . In the end , The Stone Tape was broadcast as a standalone programme but production was handled by the Dead of Night team under Lloyd . Selected as director was Hungarian Peter <unk> whose credits included adaptations of The Caves of Steel and Wuthering Heights for the BBC and Taste the Blood of Dracula and Hands of the Ripper for Hammer . Cast as Peter Brock was Michael Bryant , who had starred in the BBC 's 1970 adaptation of Jean @-@ Paul Sartre 's Roads to Freedom and had a reputation for playing " bad boy " roles . Jane Asher , playing Jill Greely , had , as a child , appeared in Hammer 's The Quatermass Xperiment , the film adaptation of Kneale 's BBC serial The Quatermass Experiment . Iain <unk> , playing Roy Collinson , was well known for his role in Budgie and would go to become the star of Sutherland 's Law while Michael Bates , cast as Eddie Holmes , would later become known for his roles in the sitcoms Last of the Summer Wine and It Ain 't Half Hot Mum . 
 Recording of The Stone Tape began on 15 November 1972 with the exterior scenes of the house , " Taskerlands " . These were shot at Horsley Towers , East Horsley in Surrey . This was once owned by Ada Lovelace , daughter of Lord Byron and sponsor of computer pioneer Charles Babbage . Production then moved to BBC Television Centre between 20 November 1972 and 22 November 1972 . Not all scenes were recorded in time and a remount was required on 4 December 1972 . Michael Bates was not available on this day and his lines had to be redistributed among the other cast members . Incidental music and sound effects were provided by Desmond Briscoe of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and these proved significant in setting the mood of the play – sections were later used in a BBC educational programme on the effectiveness of incidental music . 
 The Stone Tape aired on 25 December 1972 on BBC2 to an audience of 2 @.@ 6 million . The Evening Standard praised the play , describing it as " one of the best plays of the genre ever written . Its virtues aren 't just the main spine of the story , but the way the characters shift , as in real life , the bitter comic conflict between pure and impure science " . Viewers were similarly impressed : a panel questioned for an audience report praised The Stone Tape as " thoroughly entertaining " and " both gripping and spine @-@ chilling " . 
 The Stone Tape was one of the last plays Nigel Kneale wrote for the BBC . He had become increasingly disenchanted with the organisation , mainly as a result of the rejection of several scripts such as Cracks , a proposed Play for Today , and a fourth Quatermass serial . Moving to Independent Television , he wrote and created series such as Beasts and Kinvig and succeeded in getting his rejected Quatermass scripts produced in 1979 . He died in 2006 . 
 The script of The Stone Tape was published , along with the scripts of The Road and The Year of the Sex Olympics in 1976 by Ferret Fantasy under the title The Year of the Sex Olympics and Other TV Plays . 
 = = Cultural significance = = 
 One of the first to promulgate the hypothesis of residual haunting , that ghosts may be recordings of past events made by the physical environment , was Thomas Charles Lethbridge in books such as Ghost and Ghoul , written in 1961 . Since the broadcast of the play , this hypothesis has come to be known as the " Stone Tape Theory " by parapsychological researchers . 
 The Stone Tape was a significant influence on John Carpenter 's 1987 film Prince of Darkness in which a group of scientists investigate a mysterious cylinder discovered in the basement of a church . Besides directing the film , Carpenter wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym " Martin Quatermass " , and included a reference to " Kneale University " . This homage did little to impress Kneale , who wrote in The Observer , " For the record I have had nothing to do with the film and I have not seen it . It sounds pretty bad . With an homage like this , one might say , who needs insults ? I can only imagine that it is a whimsical riposte for my having my name removed from a film I wrote a few years ago [ a reference to Halloween III for which Kneale wrote an early draft ] and which Mr Carpenter <unk> into sawdust " . The play also influenced the 1982 Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper film Poltergeist . In the 2004 BBC7 Radio Serial " Ghost Zone " , a character refers explicitly to the " Stone Tape theory " as an explanation for the way an invading alien intelligence is " replaying " scenes and figures from the past of the remote Scottish village in which the story is set . Author Marty Ross has explicitly acknowledged the influence of Kneale 's work , and the Quatermass serials in particular , on his own BBC SF drama . 
 The Stone Tape remains well @-@ regarded to this day . Roger Fulton , writing in The Encyclopedia of TV Science Fiction , calls it " arguably the most creepy drama ever seen on television " . The writer and critic Kim Newman regards it as " one of the masterpieces of genre television , an authentic alliance of mind @-@ stretching science fiction concepts with horror and suspense plot mechanics " . Writer and member of The League of Gentlemen , Jeremy Dyson feels that The Stone Tape " strikes a note that it just circumnavigates your intellect and gets you on a much deeper level [ ... ] it just has this impact on you , rather like being in the room itself . Extraordinary piece of work " . Writer Grant Morrison recalled The Stone Tape as " really creepy and very memorable . Just brilliant images . That scared the hell out of me ! " . Sergio Angelini , writing for the British Film Institute 's Screenonline , has said that " The Stone Tape stands as perhaps his finest single work in the genre " . Lez Cooke , in his book British Television Drama : A History , has praised the play as " one of the most imaginative and intelligent examples of the horror genre to appear on British television , a single play to rank alongside the best of Play for Today " .

 = Bedtime Stories ( Madonna album ) = 
 Bedtime Stories is the sixth studio album by American singer Madonna . It was released on October 25 , 1994 , by Maverick and Warner Bros. Records . Madonna collaborated with Dallas Austin , Babyface , Dave " Jam " Hall , and Nellee Hooper in order to move into a more mainstream sound . The singer wanted to soften her image following the critical and commercial backlash she faced after releasing sexually explicit projects in the previous two years , notably the Erotica album and the book Sex in 1992 . The success of the soundtrack single " I 'll Remember " in 1994 marked the beginning of this transformation and Madonna used Bedtime Stories to continue it . 
 Bedtime Stories is a pop album which was inspired by contemporary R & B. Like its predecessor Erotica , the album explores lyrical themes of love , sorrow , and romance , but with a toned @-@ down , less sexual approach . Critics described the album as " autobiographical " , as the song " Human Nature " addresses the controversy surrounding Erotica . Madonna also worked with Icelandic singer @-@ songwriter Björk , as she wanted to explore the British club musical scene , where genres such as dub had been growing in popularity . 
 Bedtime Stories received generally favorable reviews from music critics , who praised the album 's candid lyrics and production , and it was nominated for Best Pop Album at the 38th Grammy Awards . Commercially , the album proved to be successful . Debuting and peaking at number three on the Billboard 200 , the album was certified triple @-@ platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America . It also became her fifth number @-@ one album in Australia and peaked within the top five in other international territories . Bedtime Stories has sold more than seven million copies worldwide . 
 The lead single from the album , " Secret " , gave Madonna her record @-@ breaking 35th consecutive top ten single on the UK Singles Chart , while " Take a Bow " spent seven weeks at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 . Other singles released , " Bedtime Story " and " Human Nature " , did not match the previous singles ' success . In order to further promote Bedtime Stories , Madonna performed songs from the album on the American Music Awards of 1995 and the 1995 Brit Awards . A concert tour was also planned , but did not take place due to Madonna acquiring the title role in the 1996 musical film , Evita . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1992 , Madonna released her controversial Sex book and her fifth studio album Erotica , both containing explicit sexual imagery and pictures of voyeuristic fantasies . She also starred in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence . During the same period , Madonna 's appearance on David Letterman 's talk show was noted for her controversial behavior . It included the singer using profanity that required censorship on television , and handing Letterman a pair of her panties and asking him to smell it . This made the episode the most censored in American network television talk @-@ show history , while at the same time garnering the show some of the highest ratings it ever received . All releases were panned by critics and fans alike , calling Madonna a sexual renegade and claiming that " she had gone too far " and that her career was over . A song titled " I 'll Remember " was included in the soundtrack of the film With Honors in early 1994 . The song was well received by critics and was seen as Madonna 's first positive step into reconnecting with the general public and repairing the damage that her provocative personality had caused to her career . 
 Regarding the controversial period of her career , Madonna said , " I feel I 've been misunderstood . I tried to make a statement about feeling good about yourself and exploring your sexuality , but people took it to mean that everyone should go out and have sex with everyone , and that I was going to be the leader of that . So I decided to leave it alone because that 's what everyone ended up concentrating on . Sex is such a taboo subject and it 's such a distraction that I 'd rather not even offer it up . " During 1994 , Madonna started recording her sixth studio album . She collaborated with R & B producers such as Dallas Austin , Dave " Jam " Hall , and Babyface , and also enlisting British producer Nellee Hooper to the project . It became one of the very few occasions where she collaborated with well @-@ known producers , the first since Nile Rodgers on Like a Virgin ( 1984 ) . When asked about the record , Madonna said she wanted people to concentrate on the musical aspects of it , and would like the songs to speak for themselves . She also commented that it was because she was not interested in giving many interviews and being on the cover of magazines . She described the album as " a combination of pop , R & B , hip @-@ hop and a Madonna record . It 's very , very romantic " . In an interview with The Face magazine , Madonna explained her inspirations behind Bedtime Stories as well as the reason for teaming up with R & B song producers . 
 I 've been in a reflective state of mind . I 've done lot of soul searching and I just felt in a romantic mood when I was writing for [ the album ] so that 's what I wrote about ... I decided that I wanted to work with a whole bunch of different producers . [ Icelandic singer @-@ songwriter ] Björk 's album was one of my favorite for years — it 's brilliantly produced . And I also wanted to work with Massive . So obviously , he was on the list . Nellee was the last person I worked with , and it wasn 't until then that I got a grip of what the sound of the whole record was , so I had to go back and redo a lot . 
 = = Development = = 
 Madonna 's initial work on the album had started with Shep Pettibone , who produced her fifth studio album , Erotica ( 1992 ) . However , she found out that they were doing the same vein of music from the previous album , which did not please her . At the time , Madonna was a fan of Babyface 's song " When Can I See You " ( 1994 ) , and became interested in working with him , as she wanted " lush ballads " for her record . They would collaborate on three songs for the album in his studio in Beverly Hills , with " Forbidden Love " and " Take a Bow " ending up on the album . Recalling the latter 's development , the producer commented , " I wasn 't so much thinking about the charts . I think I was more in awe of the fact that I was working with Madonna . It was initially surreal , but then you get to know the person a little bit , and you calm down and then it 's just work . And work is fun " . He also said that for " Forbidden Love " , " She heard the basic track and it all started coming out , melodies and everything ... It was a much easier process than I thought it would be " . 
 Madonna 's backup singers Donna De Lory and Niki Haris were called in to provide harmonies on " Survival " . She commented , " The minute you walked in [ the studio ] , she was giving you the lyric sheet . That was the atmosphere — we 're not here to just hang out . It 's fun , but we 're here to work and get this done " . De Lory recalls the sessions for " Survival " took a " couple of hours " and there were no retakes . During recording sessions , Madonna was interested in working with Austin after he produced Joi 's debut album The Pendulum Vibe ( 1994 ) . According to the singer , " She wanted to know , ' Who is this ? Who produced it ? How did this happen ? ' " 
 Aside from this , however , Madonna also wanted to explore the British club musical scene , where genres such as dub had been growing in popularity . In such a way , she decided to work with several European producers and composers within the electronic scene , including Nellee Hooper , who pleased Madonna due to his " very European sensibility " . Inviting Hooper over to Los Angeles , sessions started taking place in the Chappell Studios of Encino , California . Björk accepted the offer to write a track for Madonna 's album , and wrote a song initially named " Let 's Get Unconscious " . Once the song demo had been finished , Hooper and Marius De Vries rearranged the track and the final version was called " Bedtime Story " , which became the album 's third single . Academic Georges Claude Guilbert , author of Madonna As Postmodern Myth , felt that the album 's title was a pun ; " [ Madonna ] is referring to ( possible erotic ) stories told at bedtime ( in bed ) . In a way ( the album ) is really a book of stories you can tell your kids at bedtime [ ... ] sexuality explained to children [ ... ] Madonna has always thought that children should be better informed in that aspect " . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 The album 's opening track is " Survival " . It is a " sweetly funky number " which tries to " convey a loosely drawn narrative of the punishment she endured from the media and her feelings leading up to the release " . It has a lyrical allusion to the singer 's 1986 single " Live to Tell " , with double @-@ tracked strong vocals and harmonies . In the song , Madonna enhanced the rhythmic sounds more and compressed the bass sounds , in order to cater to the then musical trend . Containing multiple hooks , " Survival " ' s lyrics are about dualities like heaven / hell , up / down , angels / saints . " Secret " , the second song , begins with just the sound of Madonna 's voice singing over a rhythmic , folksy guitar in descending chord sequence , before opening up to a sparse , retro rhythm section . A deep percussion starts around the one minute mark , accompanied by wah @-@ wah ascending string line , supporting the descending guitar . Towards the end , an upper harmonic melody is added to display variance . Madonna 's voice remains at the center of the song 's production , as she sings lyrics such as " happiness lies in your own hand " . Throughout the song , Madonna also sings the lyrics " My baby 's got a secret " , however she never discloses what the secret may be . During the next song , " I 'd Rather Be Your Lover " , Madonna lusts after the unattainable through processes of negotiation : " I could be your sister , I could be your mother , We could be friends , I 'd even be your brother " . Towards the middle of the song , an eight bar rap break is taken by singer and rapper Meshell Ndegeocello , who raps : " Tell me what you want / Tell me what you need ... " . Madonna interrupts , with her voice foregrounded and juxtaposed over the short interjections of Ndegeocello 's rap part . A trip hop track , the song is musically comparable to the tracks on Portishead 's 1994 album , Dummy , and also contains influences of new jack swing . It uses a sample from " It 's Your Thing " performed by Lou Donaldson . 
 The album 's fourth track , " Don 't Stop " , is characterized by a pulsating bass overlaid with strings punctuating and accompanying the riffs in sustained and glissandi gestures . The rhetoric of the track is displayed by Madonna 's commands : " Don 't stop doin ' what you 're doin ' baby , Don 't stop , keep movin ' keep <unk> ' " . The next track " Inside of Me " starts with the same tempo as " Don 't Stop " , with guitars , sustained strings , " throbbing " bass and jazz @-@ y keyboards , with Madonna singing in a breathy vocal register . The singing conjures an erotic imagery as she sings on the chorus , " Even though you 're gone , love still carries on " , however the lyrics were interpreted as both about her deceased mother , or a long @-@ lost lover . The strings and an occasional saxophone sample makes " Inside of Me " a direct continuation of " Erotica " , with an interval where the drums drop off , exposing Madonna 's vocals . On the sixth track , " Human Nature " , Madonna confronts chauvinism as she sings , " And I 'm not sorry , I 'm not your bitch , don 't hang your shit on me " , while telling herself in whispered tones to " express yourself , don 't repress yourself " . Consisting of heavy bass and looping drum sounds in its four chord sequence , the song finds Madonna delivering a nasal tone reminiscent of 90s soul style . Together with " Survival " , the song became a vehicle for Madonna to lyrically vent off her frustrations regarding the controversies surrounding her . 
 " Forbidden Love " , seventh track on the album , finds Madonna comparing rejection to an aphrodisiac and dismissing any relationship untouched by taboo . Composed in a minor key with whispering voices in the background ( one of them being of Babyface 's ) , the song features a string section in the middle eight . The instrumentation is kept at minimum to emphasize the vocals , and the song ends with fading out . Track eight , " Love Tried to Welcome Me " , is a ballad which was inspired by a stripper Madonna met in a club , and has a fetish about rejection . The first 42 seconds consist of a string section , following which the verses start . The song projects a sombre and melancholy mood with Madonna lyrically asserting that she is " drawn to sadness " and " loneliness has never been a stranger " on the song . The next song on Bedtime Stories is " Sanctuary " where Madonna quotes Walt Whitman 's poem <unk> in the lyrics , and aligns love and death . Musically it has a " techno pull " and has an atmospheric introduction with an assortment of odd noises , electric guitar and some strings . The song is linked to the beginning of the next album track , " Bedtime Story " , which starts with its chords . It is an electronic song where Madonna wonders " Words are useless , especially sentences , They don 't stand for anything , How could they explain how I feel ? " The last song on the album " Take a Bow " is a midtempo pop ballad with a " Sukiyaki " -like Japanese touch . The chorus expresses the theme of saying goodbye to a lover who had taken her for granted . The title plays upon the verse in the song " all the world is a stage and everyone has their part " , a reference to the line by William Shakespeare in his play As You Like It , " All the world 's a stage , and all the men and women mere players " .

 The artwork for Bedtime Stories was shot by French fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier , at the Eden Roc Miami Beach Hotel in the United States in September 1994 . She also worked with hairstylist Sam McKnight for the pictures , which were directed by Fabien Baron . McKnight recalled that it was a " low @-@ key " photoshoot featuring less than 50 people , and was conducted on Madonna 's birthday , hence it was wrapped up fast since the singer had to go for her party . The cover was released online , and depicted the singer upside down , looking upward with heavy make @-@ up , a nose ring , blond hair , and simple neon fonts . Inspired by actress Jean Harlow , the singer sported over @-@ plucked eyebrows for the photos which were designed by makeup artist Francois <unk> . 
 Michael R. Smith from The Daily Vault website stated that the artwork was " colorful " and was seen by him as one of the high points of the release . While reviewing photographer Demarchelier 's life and career , the cover was seen as " memorable " by Valentine de <unk> . American singer Christina Aguilera 's fifth studio album artwork , Back to Basics ( 2006 ) received comparisons to Bedtime Stories ' cover for being too similar . The packaging for Bedtime Stories featured white plastic <unk> holding the CD , while the cover was sky @-@ blue paper with a velvety texture . British journalist Paul Du Noyer gave a detailed description of Madonna 's image change with the album , during an interview with the singer for Q magazine , saying : 
 Madonna looks both older and younger than she does in the photos and the videos : a little more lined and possibly tired , but also less mature and grand . Her manner is quite teenaged , not femme fatale . She seems up for mischief , and yet quite conscious of her power . At the same time , her very frankness is almost innocent . These combinations are odd , and they give her the air of a prematurely wise child . Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash : Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie . She is not bewitching , but is certainly beautiful . She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview . If you saw her in the street , you 'd think : she looks like a girl who looks a bit like Madonna .

 To promote the album 's release , Madonna talked about the album in an audio message available exclusively online prior to its release . There were promotional advertisements aired on television channels proclaiming that there will be " no sexual references on the album " and Madonna adding that " it 's a whole new me ! I 'm going to be a good girl , I swear . " One of the first promotional appearances the singer did was in Paris , where she was interviewed by Ruby Wax and talked about the album . According to Wax , she was quite intimidated by Madonna and her entourage and , in her own words , " [ my ] nerves got the best of me " . On February 18 , 1995 , Madonna arrived in Europe to promote Bedtime Stories . During the same day , she performed " Secret " and " Take a Bow " on German TV show Wetten , dass .. ? , while she was also interviewed on the program . 
 Madonna went back to United States and performed " Take a Bow " on the American Music Awards of 1995 , accompanied by Babyface and a full orchestra . She returned to Europe to sing " Bedtime Story " during the 1995 Brit Awards ; she wore a white Versace dress and long hair extensions , and featured a trio of satin @-@ clad male dancers . Madonna invited Björk , who wrote the track , to feature in the performance ; however , the singer turned it down . The singer also promoted " Take a Bow " by performing on Sanremo Music Festival . At the end of the performance , she thanked the audience in Italian language , and received standing ovation . In order to promote the video for " Bedtime Story " , MTV aired a special titled Madonna 's Pajama Party on March 18 , 1995 , where the singer could be seen reading a bedtime story in Webster Hall in New York City . At the event , " cutting @-@ edge " tribal and trance remixes , made by disc jockey and producer Junior Vasquez , were also played . 
 Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera mentioned that Madonna would play in Italy as part of a world tour to promote Bedtime Stories in spring or fall 1995 . However , Madonna and her manager Freddy DeMann cancelled all plans after she was offered the role of Eva Perón on the film Evita , directed by Alan Parker . Her spokesperson Liz Rosenberg considered a " shorter tour " because of filming , however , Madonna commented , " I 've waited years for this role , and I have to put every ounce of concentration into it . I love touring , and I very much want to go out with this album . But I can 't — I 'd be going straight from months on the road right into filming ; I 'd be exhausted and strained . It wouldn 't be in the best interests of the movie for me to be at any less than my peak of energy " .

 " Secret " was released as the album 's lead single in September 1994 . The song achieved success in the charts , peaking inside the top five in most countries , while in the US the song reached number three on Billboard Hot 100 . " Take a Bow " , produced by Kenneth " Babyface " Edmonds , was the album 's second single . It topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for seven weeks and is her longest @-@ running number @-@ one single on this chart . It was her 11th single to top the Billboard Hot 100 and her 23rd top five entry @-@ both records for a female artist . She also replaced Carole King as the female who had written the most number one songs . 
 " Bedtime Story " was released as the third single in February 1995 . On the Hot 100 chart , the song peaked at number 42 , becoming the first Madonna single since " Burning Up " ( 1983 ) not to reach the top 40 . If the single reached the top 40 , Madonna would at the time have become the third woman in the " rock era " with the most top 40 hits , behind Aretha Franklin and Connie Francis . It would have given her a consecutive string of 33 top 40 hits , starting from her single " Holiday " ( 1983 ) . Nonetheless , the song 's " loss " of radio airplay and sales prevented it from peaking within the US top 40 . " Human Nature " was released as the fourth and final single from Bedtime Stories in June 1995 . Like the previous single , it failed to reach the top 40 in the United States , peaking at number 46 . However , the song reached the top 10 in several countries including Italy and the UK .

 Bedtime Stories received generally positive reviews from music critics . J. Randy Taraborrelli , author of Madonna : An Intimate Biography , praised the album for being " considerably more tame in tone and image than [ Erotica 's ] ethereal sounding , sexually explicit " content . AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four out of five stars , claiming that it is a " warm album " and that it " offers her most humane and open music " . Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a positive review as well , giving it a B + grade , and writing that " the new tracks work less as individual songs than as a sustained mood " and that Madonna " still has something to reveal " . Barbara O 'Dair of Rolling Stone also gave the album a three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five , writing that " Madonna has come up with awfully compelling sounds " . Billboard , while giving the album a positive review , commented that it " sticks to a pop recipe that yields hits galore , with little excess baggage " . In 2015 , Billboard ranked it as Madonna 's sixth best album ; " while not as hardcore as 1992 's Erotica , Bedtime captured Madonna in transition , swiveling away from explicit sexuality and relying on R & B and balladry before she dove headfirst into dance music four years later . Songs like ' Human Nature ' , ' Secret ' and ' I 'd Rather Be Your Lover ' proved more compelling than most of the New Jack music being released in the mid @-@ 90s , and ' Take a Bow ' added a classic slow jam to Madge 's canon " . Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave Bedtime Stories a positive review and four out of five stars , writing that it is " a fluffy @-@ <unk> concept album that unfolds like a musical fairy tale " . 
 The New York Times writer Stephen Holden considered Bedtime Stories as " easily Madonna 's best album " , and concluded that it was a " seductive mixture of soft @-@ focus hip @-@ hop and bittersweet ballads " . Peter Galvin from The Advocate magazine gave a positive review , describing the album as " a <unk> produced R & B album with lots of funky beats lush keyboards , and soaring Love Unlimited @-@ style string arrangements " . Barry Walters from The San Francisco Examiner praised the album as Madonna 's most low @-@ key album and her best work at the date . J.D. Considine , while writing his review for the album for The Baltimore Sun , declared that Bedtime Stories was more listener @-@ friendly than Madonna 's previous albums . He added that it " seems remarkably close in spirit to the singer 's first album , emphasizing dance grooves and pop melodies over genre exercises and conceptual statements " , while praising Madonna 's vocal performance . Linda L. <unk> from the Bangor Daily News , noted that " [ Madonna ] isn 't taking any chances . This time around , her daring has more to do with music than lyrics " , while also praising her vocals ; " If anything , her singing is the album 's greatest strength . Madonna uses every trick from her repertoire . [ ... ] Bedtime Stories turns in some of the strongest performances of her career . ' Madonna sings well ' — bet you don 't see that headline in the tabloids anytime soon " . Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times gave it two @-@ stars @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of four , writing that the album " seems the least remarkable of all Madonna 's albums . But it 's not necessarily the least of them . [ ... ] It has a nice , consistently relaxed feel , its slow jams hip @-@ hop @-@ inflected but not as self @-@ consciously as last time " . 
 The Milwaukee Journal 's Tina Maples provided a mixed review for the album , criticizing its " hoary cliches " and " bland , mid @-@ tempo soul @-@ pop ballads that confuse sophistication with <unk> " , and added that with the album , Madonna was feeling the " fallout " of building her career on " shock value " . However , she highlighted " Secret " , " Bedtime Story " and " Take a Bow " as the standout tracks from Bedtime Stories . Steve Morse , writer from The Boston Globe journal , criticized the album for lacking " life " , and being " flat and listless " , and said that Madonna seemed lost throughout the album . Allen Metz and Carol Benson , authors of The Madonna Companion : Two Decades of Commentary , opined that " rather than signify ( ing ) some bold new direction for Madonna , Bedtime Stories takes hardly any risks at all . [ ... ] it offers neither the pop epiphany of Like a Prayer nor the shameless frolic of Madonna 's earlier dance hits " . British magazine NME ranked Bedtime Stories as the 30th best album of 1994 . At the 38th Grammy Awards in 1996 , the album received a nomination for Best Pop Album . Slant Magazine included Bedtime Stories on their list of " The Best Albums of the 1990s " at number 63 , with Cinquemani writing , " instead of simply following American trends of the time , Madge infused the album with the edgier trip @-@ hop sounds that were happening on the other side of the pond . But it was her refined literary taste , from Proust to Whitman , and both the media and the public 's rejection of her sexual politicking that truly informed the singer 's seventh album . "

 According to journalist Mary von Aue from Vice magazine , Bedtime Stories is the " most important " album released by Madonna . For months leading up to its release , the promotion associated cited the record as an apology for the singer 's sexually provocative imagery . Critics had also hoped for a return to more innocent form of music . However Madonna instead chose to portray herself as unapologetic for her imagery , as well as talking about scrutiny that female musicians faced . Madonna went opposite to what was being portrayed as the theme of the album in the promotional campaigns , and continued addressing her critics and people who had tried to shame her for being provocative . 
 Von Aue added that the two @-@ punch of the tracks " Human Nature " and " Bedtime Story " illustrated the duality of the album , with the former being about how nonchalant Madonna was with the criticism she had faced , and the latter as a feminist piece . Von Aue concluded by saying that " Today , Bedtime Stories is not the first album that comes to mind in Madonna 's legacy . It is , however , the most relevant to many of the cultural conversations that are still happening . Had she acquiesced to the public 's call for apology , it could have set a dangerous standard for how the public can decree an artist ’ s silence , and it would have allowed the categories for female singers to remain in place " . 
 Bianca Gracie from Idolator website wrote that " Bedtime Stories proved that Madonna never lost her edge ; she just decided to soften it so that her image could regroup . When listening to the sultry undertones and R & B influences threaded throughout it , you come to realize how flawlessly the singer could change up her persona while still sounding genuine " . Gracie believed that Bedtime Stories was an album with " timeless sound " and signified an evolution of Madonna as an artist , acting as the front @-@ runner to her more experimental album like Ray of Light ( 1998 ) . However she noted how the album never let go of the sexual provocation associated with Madonna and how the singer chose to turn against what people expected from her at that time — being apologetic .

 = Ostend Manifesto = 
 The Ostend Manifesto , aka Ostend Circular , was a document written in 1854 that described the rationale for the United States to purchase Cuba from Spain while implying that the U.S. should declare war if Spain refused . Cuba 's annexation had long been a goal of U.S. slaveholding expansionists , and was supported by a faction in Cuba itself . At the national level , American leaders had been satisfied to have the island remain in weak Spanish hands so long as it did not pass to a stronger power such as Britain or France . The Ostend Manifesto proposed a shift in foreign policy , justifying the use of force to seize Cuba in the name of national security . It resulted from debates over slavery in the United States , Manifest Destiny , and the Monroe Doctrine , as slaveholders sought new territory for slavery 's expansion . 
 During the administration of President Franklin Pierce , a pro @-@ Southern Democrat , Southern expansionists called for acquiring Cuba as a slave state , but the breakout of violence following the Kansas – Nebraska Act left the administration unsure of how to proceed . At the suggestion of Secretary of State William L. Marcy , American ministers in Europe — Pierre Soulé for Spain , James Buchanan for Great Britain , and John Y. Mason for France — met to discuss strategy related to an acquisition of Cuba . They met secretly at Ostend , Belgium , and drafted a dispatch at Aix @-@ la @-@ Chapelle . The document was sent to Washington in October 1854 , outlining why a purchase of Cuba would be beneficial to each of the nations and declaring that the U.S. would be " justified in wresting " the island from Spanish hands if Spain refused to sell . To Marcy 's chagrin , Soulé made no secret of the meetings , causing unwanted publicity in both Europe and the U.S. The administration was finally forced to publish the contents of the dispatch , which caused it irreparable damage . 
 The dispatch was published as demanded by the House of Representatives . Dubbed the " Ostend Manifesto " , it was immediately denounced in both the Northern states and Europe . The Pierce administration suffered a significant setback , and the manifesto became a rallying cry for anti @-@ slavery Northerners . The question of Cuba 's annexation was effectively set aside until the late 19th century , when support grew for Cuban independence from Spain . 
 = = Historical context = = 
 Located 90 miles ( 140 km ) off the coast of Florida , Cuba had been discussed as a subject for annexation in several presidential administrations . Presidents John Quincy Adams and Thomas Jefferson expressed great interest in Cuba , with Adams observing during his Secretary of State tenure that it had " become an object of transcendent importance to the commercial and political interests of our Union " . He later described Cuba and Puerto Rico as " natural appendages to the North American continent " – the former 's annexation was " indispensable to the continuance and integrity of the Union itself . " As the Spanish Empire had lost much of its power , a no @-@ transfer policy began with Jefferson whereby the U.S. respected Spanish sovereignty , considering the island 's eventual absorption inevitable . The U.S. simply wanted to ensure that control did not pass to a stronger power such as Britain or France . 
 Cuba was of special importance to Southern Democrats , who believed their economic and political interests would be best served by the admission of another slave state to the Union . The existence of slavery in Cuba , the island 's plantation economy based on sugar , and its geographical location predisposed it to Southern influence ; its admission would greatly strengthen the position of Southern slaveholders , whose way of life was under fire from Northern abolitionists . Whereas immigration to Northern industrial centers had resulted in Northern control of the population @-@ based House of Representatives , Southern politicians sought to maintain the fragile balance of power in the Senate , where each state received equal representation . As slavery @-@ free Western states were admitted , Southern politicians increasingly looked to Cuba as the next slave state . If Cuba were admitted to the Union as a single state , the island would have sent two senators and nine representatives to Washington . 
 In the Democratic Party , the debate over the continued expansion of the United States centered on how quickly , rather than whether , to expand . Radical expansionists and the Young America movement were quickly gaining traction by 1848 , and a debate about whether to annex the Yucatán portion of Mexico that year included significant discussion of Cuba . Even John C. Calhoun , described as a reluctant expansionist who strongly disagreed with intervention on the basis of the Monroe Doctrine , concurred that " it is indispensable to the safety of the United States that this island should not be in certain hands . " likely referring to Britain . 
 In light of a Cuban uprising , President James K. Polk refused solicitations from filibuster backer John L. O 'Sullivan and stated his belief that any acquisition of the island must be an " amicable purchase . " Under orders from Polk , Secretary of State James Buchanan prepared an offer of $ 100 million , but " sooner than see [ Cuba ] transferred to any power , [ Spanish officials ] would prefer seeing it sunk into the ocean . " The Whig administrations of presidents Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore did not pursue the matter and took a harsher stand against filibusters as Venezuelan Narciso Lopez , with federal troops intercepting several expeditions bound for Cuba . When Franklin Pierce took office in 1853 , however , he was committed to Cuba 's annexation . 
 = = The Pierce administration = = 
 At Pierce 's inauguration , he stated , " The policy of my Administration will not be controlled by any timid forebodings of evil from expansion . " While slavery was not the stated goal nor Cuba mentioned by name , the antebellum makeup of his party required the Northerner to appeal to Southern interests , so he favored the annexation of Cuba as a slave state . To this end , he appointed expansionists to diplomatic posts throughout Europe , notably sending Pierre Soulé , an outspoken proponent of Cuban annexation , as United States Minister to Spain . The Northerners in his cabinet were fellow <unk> ( Northerners with Southern sympathies ) such as Buchanan , who was made Minister to Great Britain after a failed bid for the presidency at the Democratic National Convention , and Secretary of State William L. Marcy , whose appointment was also an attempt to placate the " Old <unk> . " This was the term for the wing of the party that favored slow , cautious expansion . 
 In March 1854 , the steamer Black Warrior stopped at the Cuban port of Havana on a regular trading route from New York City to Mobile , Alabama . When it failed to provide a cargo manifest , Cuban officials seized the ship , its cargo , and its crew . The so @-@ called Black Warrior Affair was viewed by Congress as a violation of American rights ; a hollow ultimatum issued by Soulé to the Spanish to return the ship served only to strain relations , and he was barred from discussing Cuba 's acquisition for nearly a year . While the matter was resolved peacefully , it fueled the flames of Southern expansionism . 
 Meanwhile , the doctrine of Manifest Destiny had become increasingly <unk> as the decade progressed . While there were still Northerners who believed the United States should dominate the continent , most were opposed to Cuba 's annexation , particularly as a slave state . Southern @-@ backed filibusters , including Narciso López , had failed repeatedly since 1849 to 1851 to overthrow the colonial government despite considerable support among the Cuban people for independence , and a series of reforms on the island made Southerners apprehensive that slavery would be abolished . They believed that Cuba would be " Africanized , " as the majority of the population were slaves , and they had seen the Republic of Haiti established by former slaves . The notion of a pro @-@ slavery invasion by the U.S. was rejected in light of the controversy over the Kansas – Nebraska Act . During internal discussions , supporters of gaining Cuba decided that a purchase or intervention in the name of national security was the most acceptable method of acquisition . 
 = = Writing the Manifesto = = 
 Marcy suggested Soulé confer with Buchanan and John Y. Mason , Minister to France , on U.S. policy toward Cuba . He had previously written to Soulé that , if Cuba 's purchase could not be negotiated , " you will then direct your effort to the next desirable object , which is to detach that island from the Spanish dominion and from all dependence on any European power " – words Soulé may have adapted to fit his own agenda . Authors David Potter and Lars <unk> both note the considerable ambiguity in Marcy 's cryptic words , and Samuel Bemis suggests he may have referred to Cuban independence , but acknowledges it is impossible to know Marcy 's true intent . In any case , Marcy had also written in June that the administration had abandoned thoughts of declaring war over Cuba . But Robert May writes , " the instructions for the conference had been so vague , and so many of Marcy 's letters to Soulé since the Black Warrior incident had been bellicose , that the ministers misread the administration 's intent . " 
 After a minor disagreement about their meeting site , the three American diplomats met in Ostend , Belgium from October 9 – 11 , 1854 , then adjourned to Aix @-@ la @-@ Chapelle for a week to prepare a report of the proceedings . The resulting dispatch , which would come to be known as the Ostend Manifesto , declared that " Cuba is as necessary to the North American republic as any of its present members , and that it belongs naturally to that great family of states of which the Union is the <unk> Nursery " . 
 Prominent among the reasons for annexation outlined in the manifesto were fears of a possible slave revolt in Cuba parallel to the Haitian Revolution ( 1791 – 1804 ) in the absence of U.S. intervention . The Manifesto urged against inaction on the Cuban question , warning , 
 " We should , however , be <unk> to our duty , be unworthy of our gallant forefathers , and commit base treason against our posterity , should we permit Cuba to be Africanized and become a second St. Domingo ( Haiti ) , with all its attendant horrors to the white race , and suffer the flames to extend to our own neighboring shores , seriously to endanger or actually to consume the fair fabric of our Union . " 
 Racial fears , largely spread by Spain , raised tension and anxiety in the U.S. over a potential black uprising on the island that could " spread like wildfire " to the southern U.S. The Manifesto stated that the U.S. would be " justified in wresting " Cuba from Spain if the colonial power refused to sell it . 
 Soulé was a former U.S. Senator from Louisiana and member of the Young America movement , who sought a realization of American influence in the Caribbean and Central America . He is credited as the primary architect of the policy expressed in the Ostend Manifesto . The experienced and cautious Buchanan is believed to have written the document and moderated Soulé 's aggressive tone . Soulé highly favored expansion of Southern influence outside the current Union of States . His belief in Manifest Destiny led him to prophesy " absorption of the entire continent and its island appendages " by the U.S. Mason 's Virginian roots predisposed him to the sentiments expressed in the document , but he later regretted his actions . Buchanan 's exact motivations remain unclear despite his expansionist tendencies , but it has been suggested that he was seduced by visions of the presidency , which he would go on to win in 1856 . One historian concluded in 1893 , " When we take into account the characteristics of the three men we can hardly resist the conclusion that Soulé , as he afterwards intimated , twisted his colleagues round his finger . " 
 To Marcy 's chagrin , the flamboyant Soulé made no secret of the meetings . The press in both Europe and the U.S. were well aware of the proceedings if not their outcome , but were preoccupied with wars and midterm elections . In the latter case , the Democratic Party became a minority in the United States Congress , and editorials continued to chide the Pierce administration for its secrecy . At least one newspaper , the New York Herald , published what Brown calls " reports that came so close to the truth of the decisions at Ostend that the President feared they were based on leaks , as indeed they may have been " . Pierce feared the political repercussions of confirming such rumors , and he did not acknowledge them in his State of the Union address at the end of 1854 . The administration 's opponents in the House of Representatives called for the document 's release , and it was published in full four months after being written . 
 = = Fallout = = 
 When the document was published , Northerners were outraged by what they considered a Southern attempt to extend slavery . American free @-@ <unk> , recently angered by the strengthened Fugitive Slave Law ( passed as part of the Compromise of 1850 and requiring officials of free states to cooperate in the return of slaves ) , decried as unconstitutional what Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune labeled " The Manifesto of the <unk> . " During the period of Bleeding Kansas , as anti- and pro @-@ slavery supporters fought for control of the state , the Ostend Manifesto served as a rallying cry for the opponents of the Slave Power . The incident was one of many <unk> that gave rise to the Republican Party , and the manifesto was criticized in the Party 's first platform in 1856 as following a " highwayman 's " philosophy of " might makes right . " But , the movement to annex Cuba did not fully end until after the American Civil War . 
 The Pierce Administration was irreparably damaged by the incident . Pierce had been highly sympathetic to the Southern cause , and the controversy over the Ostend Manifesto contributed to the splintering of the Democratic Party . Internationally , it was seen as a threat to Spain and to imperial power across Europe . It was quickly denounced by national governments in Madrid , London , and Paris . To preserve what favorable relations the administration had left , Soulé was ordered to cease discussion of Cuba ; he promptly resigned . The backlash from the Ostend Manifesto caused Pierce to abandon expansionist plans . It has been described as part of a series of " gratuitous conflicts ... that cost more than they were worth " for Southern interests intent on maintaining the institution of slavery . 
 Buchanan was easily elected President in 1856 . Although he remained committed to Cuban annexation , he was hindered by popular opposition and the growing sectional conflict . It was not until thirty years after the Civil War that the so @-@ called Cuban Question again came to national prominence . 
 = Battle of Vauchamps = 
 The Battle of Vauchamps ( 14 February 1814 ) was the final major engagement of the Six Days Campaign of the War of the Sixth Coalition . It resulted in a part of the Grande Armée under Napoleon I defeating a superior Prussian and Russian force of the Army of Silesia under Field @-@ marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher . 
 At the beginning of 1814 , the armies of the French Empire , under the direct command of Emperor Napoleon I , were scrambling to defend Eastern France against the invading Coalition Armies . Despite fighting against vastly superior forces , Napoleon managed to score a few significant victories and , between 10 and 13 February repeatedly beat Blücher ’ s Army of Silesia . On 13 February , reeling from his successive defeats , Blücher looked to disengage from Napoleon and instead manoeuvre with a part of his forces to fall upon the isolated VI Corps of Marshal Auguste de Marmont , who was defending Napoleon ’ s rear . The Prussian commander attacked and pushed back Marmont late on 13 February . Nevertheless , the Emperor had read into his enemy ’ s intentions and directed powerful forces to support Marmont . 
 On the morning of 14 February , Blücher , commanding a Prussian Corps and elements of two Russian Corps , resumed his attack against Marmont . The latter continued to fall back until he was reinforced . Napoleon arrived on the battlefield with strong combined @-@ arms forces , which allowed the French to launch a determined counterattack and drive back the leading elements of the Army of Silesia . Blücher realized that he was facing the Emperor in person and decided to pull back and avoid another battle against Napoleon . In practice , Blücher 's attempt to disengage proved extremely difficult to execute , as the Coalition force was by now in an advanced position , had virtually no cavalry present to cover its retreat and was facing an enemy who was ready to commit its numerous cavalry . 
 While the actual pitched battle was short , the French infantry , under Marshal Marmont , and most of all the cavalry , under General Emmanuel de Grouchy , launched a relentless pursuit that rode down the enemy . Retreating in slow @-@ moving square formations in broad daylight and along some excellent cavalry terrain , the Coalition forces suffered very heavy losses , with several squares broken by the French cavalry . At nightfall , combat ceased and Blücher opted for an exhausting night march in order to take his remaining forces to safety . 
 = = Context = = 
 On 13 February , having fought three successful actions in three days against the Prussian and Russian army at Champaubert , Montmirail and Château @-@ Thierry , Napoleon was pursuing the defeated enemy . After his consecutive defeats , Field @-@ marshal Blücher decided to disengage from Napoleon and move a significant force against the isolated French Army Corps of Marshal Marmont , at Étoges . Blücher knew that Marmont 's Corps was weak and his plan was to destroy it and thus fall upon the rear of Napoleon 's main force . 
 Still in pursuit of the debris of the enemy force , late on 13 February , Napoleon received reports that Marmont 's Corps had been attacked and pushed out of his position at Étoges . The Emperor deduced that the enemy force before him would have to be a much reduced one and promptly decided to go to Marmont 's aid . The Emperor left Château @-@ Thierry on 14 February , towards 3 o 'clock in the morning , leaving a small portion of his forces with Marshal Édouard Mortier , duc de <unk> , with orders to continue the pursuit of the enemy . Taking with him the cavalry of the Guard and Grouchy 's Cavalry Reserve , Napoleon headed for the village of Vauchamps . 
 Meanwhile , late on 13 February , having successfully regrouped what forces he could muster at Bergères @-@ lès @-@ Vertus , Blücher had launched an attack against Marmont 's single division , pushing him out of Étoges and advancing as planned towards Champaubert and Fromentières , in the rear of Napoleon 's force . However , having read Blücher 's intentions , Napoleon had given orders for a concentration of French forces in that very sector .
