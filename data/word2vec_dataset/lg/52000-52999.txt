 = Wonderland ( Faryl Smith album ) = 
 Wonderland is the second studio album by teenage mezzo @-@ soprano Faryl Smith , released by Decca Records on 30 November 2009 . Smith became famous after her participation in Britain 's Got Talent in 2008 , and subsequently , aged 13 , signed with Universal Classics and Jazz , releasing her debut album , Faryl . Released only a few months afterwards , Wonderland contains a mix of classical and non @-@ classical songs , which were chosen by both Smith and her record label . A concept album , it is based on Alice in Wonderland , and features a digitally produced " duet " with Luciano Pavarotti , who died in 2007 , as well as a song set to " Winter " , from Vivaldi 's Four Seasons . As with Faryl , Wonderland was produced by Jon Cohen . 
 Smith promoted the album with appearances on television and radio . For the most part , critics responded positively to the album , with praise for Smith 's vocals , the song choice and the musical arrangement , but criticism for " the lack of emotional weight " . Further , critics observed that Smith 's voice had improved since her appearance on Britain 's Got Talent . Despite this , Wonderland appeared in the UK Albums Chart for only one week , peaking at 54 , proving less successful than Faryl . Smith later rerecorded " The Prayer " , her cover of which was originally released on Wonderland , with 22 other classical artists , with proceeds going to charity .

 Smith , aged 13 at the time , signed a record @-@ breaking multi @-@ album deal with Universal Classics and Jazz in December 2008 , six months after finishing outside the top three in the Britain 's Got Talent series two final . Her debut album , Faryl , was released in March 2009 . Smith later described the album as " an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording " , and said that she " wanted to follow up [ Faryl ] as quickly as possible with another record , something richer and varied " . In July , it was announced that work had begun on her second album , with hopes to release it later in the year . Smith said in an interview that " We 're starting to look at what songs will be on the second album ... I 'm not really choosing the songs myself , I 'm leaving that up to the people at the record label . I 'm really happy that they want me to do another album so soon – I didn 't think I would be working on one so quickly after the first one was released ... I 'm just excited to get under way with it . " 
 = = Recording and release = = 
 Wonderland was revealed as the album 's name in September , and a preliminary release date of 30 November was forwarded . Recording took place at Sarm Studios in Notting Hill , London , and completed in early October . Smith recorded her vocals during her school holidays . Initially , Smith was asked by her label for a track listing , but said that she " didn 't know what songs would be wrong or right for an album " . Instead , she and Decca both created their own lists , and the final track list was compiled from the two . The result included a variety of songs ; Smith said she was pleased with the mix , citing " classical numbers " like " The Prayer " , in contrast to " a more unexpected song " , " Close to You " . The track " O Holy Night " features a " duet " with Luciano Pavarotti , who died in 2007 ; Pavarotti 's vocals were digitally added to Smith 's recording to produce the song , resulting in the pair sounding " as if they 're really there together " . The title track , " Wonderland " , is set to " Winter " , from Vivaldi 's Four Seasons , and the lead track , " Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence ( Somewhere Far Away ) " is an adaptation of a piece by Ryuichi Sakamoto , originally from Merry Christmas , Mr. Lawrence . Smith 's favourite tracks on the album are " O Holy Night " and " The Prayer " . 
 The album was produced by Jon Cohen , who also produced Faryl and has previously worked with artists including the Opera Babes and Vanessa @-@ Mae . Cohen said that Smith has " matured as an artist since the first album " and that he had " no doubt that once again , people will be astonished and moved by her performances " . Smith 's father , Tony , said that the bosses at universal were hoping for the album to be more commercially successful than Faryl , but noted that the market around Christmas time is tough , due to the high volume of releases . Brian Roberts , writing for the Daily Mirror , claimed that Wonderland was " tipped to go head to head " for the number one classical album position with releases from Il Divo and Rhydian Roberts . 
 Wonderland is a concept album loosely based on Lewis Carroll 's Alice in Wonderland . The album took the title from the book , and was created with the intention of taking listeners on a journey , as well as showcasing Smith 's voice . She said that " that 's something I like to hear in music . Whether I listen to Beyonce [ sic ] or Vivaldi , music is supposed to transport you away , escape from the everyday . " Smith said that she sometimes felt like Alice chasing White Rabbit , and , for this reason , " Wonderland " was a suitable title track for the album . 
 = = Promotion = = 
 Wonderland was released for the Christmas market , and was labelled as a potential Christmas number one . Smith embarked on a promotional tour , beginning at the end of October , with magazine , television and radio appearances . Appearances included Ready Steady Cook , Blue Peter , the BBC News Channel , Sky News Sunrise , The Alan Titchmarsh Show and The Paul O 'Grady Show . Speaking about the album 's promotion , Smith said " [ i ] t is always a struggle when a second album comes out because you never know how it is going to do but fingers crossed people will enjoy it . I am very proud of it . ... I am excited about going on all the shows too – especially Ready Steady Cook because I can 't cook and I think it will be fun . " 
 = = Reception and performance = = 
 Critics responded positively to the album . Paul Callan , reviewing the album for the Daily Express , described Wonderland as " a joy " ; he compared it to other Christmas albums , saying that " [ t ] oo many are tired , much @-@ repeated carol selections . " He described Smith 's " control , tone and warmth " as " very moving " . Overall , he gave the album 4 out of 5 . A reviewer writing for The Sun described the album as a " lush collection " of songs , and said that Smith 's " voice is now stronger , richer and even more musical " . Andy Gill , reviewing Wonderland for The Independent , gave a more mixed review . He said that the influence of Alice in Wonderland was often hard to perceive , and said that Cohen and Smith had " sweetened the classical elements " . He praised the arrangements of " Adiemus " , " Barcarolle " , " Merry Christmas , Mr Lawrence " and " Blow the Wind Southerly " , but noted that " on " Close to You " and other tracks , " the lack of emotional weight is telling . " Overall , Gill gave Wonderland 3 out of 5 . 
 Local paper the Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph reported that Wonderland was selling well ; on Amazon.co.uk 's charts , it appeared at number one on the symphonies chart , 13 on easy listening and 95 overall . A spokesman for the local HMV store was quoted as saying " Sales of the new Faryl album have got off to a storming start – she is proving hugely popular at HMV . ... We 're actually selling as many copies of Faryl 's new album as we are Susan Boyle right now . " However , the album entered the top 75 of the UK Albums Chart for only one week , peaking at 54 . It appeared on the Arts & Book Review ( Independent Print ) classical albums chart for two weeks , peaking at number 6 . The album proved less successful than Smith 's debut , and , subsequent to its release , Smith 's contract with Universal ended . 
 Having originally released her version of " The Prayer " on Wonderland , Smith and 22 other classical musicians from the UK recorded a version of the song for charity in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake . The proceeds of the single , which was released on 14 March 2010 , went to the Disasters Emergency Committee . Smith said " It 's a real honour to be a part of something that is being done for the first time , and I hope that all music lovers get involved and help raise money for the campaign . I really hope that we can make a difference together to help the horrible situation that Haiti is in at the moment . " The group , dubbed " Classical Band Aid " , recorded the track at Metropolis Studios and were backed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra . Each vocalist in the group performed their own solo lines , and the entire group came together for the finale . " The Prayer " was the first ever classical charity single ; Smith noted that " Pop singers do things like this a lot but it 's unusual for classical singers to get involved so I 've been really excited .

 = Orval Grove = 
 Orval Leroy Grove ( August 29 , 1919 – April 20 , 1992 ) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for ten seasons in the American League with the Chicago White Sox . In 207 career games , Grove pitched 1 @,@ 176 innings and posted a win – loss record of 63 – 73 , with 66 complete games , 11 shutouts , and a 3 @.@ 78 earned run average ( ERA ) . 
 The only freshman on the Proviso High School varsity baseball team , Grove 's pitching ability attracted the attention of the White Sox . After signing with the team in 1937 , Grove moved between the major leagues and minor leagues for a few seasons until 1943 , when he found a solid place in the White Sox 's pitching rotation . Grove had a career @-@ year in 1943 , finishing the season with career @-@ bests in ERA , wins , and complete games ; in 1944 , he made his only All @-@ Star appearance . 
 Grove spent four more full seasons with the White Sox , and after pitching one game in 1949 , was sent to the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League . After playing four seasons with them , he formally retired from professional baseball . After retirement , he worked with his uncle in a trucking business in Chicago while continuing to pitch at the semi @-@ pro level . In 1992 , Grove died at the age of 72 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Grove was born in West Mineral , Kansas , on August 29 , 1919 , and was raised in Maywood , Illinois . By eighth grade , Grove developed a fondness for baseball and began pitching for the Proviso East High School baseball team . He became the first freshman member of the varsity team in school history . During a high school pitching career of three years , Grove lost only two games and pitched a no @-@ hitter and two one @-@ hitters . Over the summer of 1937 , Grove attracted the attention of Chicago White Sox talent scout Doug Minor , who requested that he " come and workout with the Sox . " Later that year , Grove was signed by the White Sox for $ 2 @,@ 500 and began his minor league career , foregoing his senior season of high school . 
 = = Minor league career = = 
 Grove began his career with the Dallas Steers of the Texas League at the start of the 1938 season . He played with the Steers until management began to replace young players with veterans due to the team 's struggling form and moved Grove to the Longview Cannibals . As his first minor league season drew to a close , Grove planned on returning to Proviso High School to complete his education . At the end of the season , the St. Paul Saints purchased Grove 's contract to replenish their pitching staff . 
 After the 1939 season had begun , Grove became part of the Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas League ; St. Paul did not see much potential in him . Grove played well enough over the course of the season to receive votes for Most Valuable Player , which ultimately went to Nick <unk> . In 1939 , Grove had a peculiar game while pitching against the Tulsa Oilers . Playing in a night game with virtually no light due to storms , Grove did not allow a hit during his time on the mound , but earned the loss because he walked three men in a row , which allowed a run to score . As the 1940 season began , Grove became a part of the White Sox roster and began his Major League career . 
 = = Transition to the majors = = 
 During spring training in 1940 , Hall of Fame pitcher Ted Lyons said that Grove would have a great career , stating , " They 'll never drive that sinker very far . " Grove was an official part of the 40 @-@ man roster as the 1940 season began ( teams started rather than ended the season with 40 men at this time ) , but had not made an appearance after a month on the roster . The White Sox planned to use three rookie pitchers , including Grove , during the final week of May , as they had three doubleheaders that week . Grove made his Major League debut on May 28 , 1940 . He pitched in two more games for the White Sox that season before being sent back to Oklahoma City . Grove finished 1940 with six innings of major league work over three games , allowing two earned runs . The highlight of Grove 's 1940 season came on August 11 against the Oilers ; he pitched a complete game that lasted 12 innings , winning 1 – 0 against Hall of Famer Dizzy Dean . Grove finished the minor league season with nine wins and eight losses , but the team saw issues with his control , and as a result he spent most of the next season in the minor leagues . 
 In 1941 , Grove played two games for the White Sox , pitching seven innings and allowing eight runs during the two outings . He spent the start of the 1941 season at Oklahoma City , though on May 19 he was sent to the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League , where he spent the rest of the season . Grove concluded the year at Oklahoma City with a 17 – 7 record , an improvement over the previous season . However , Grove received a knee injury late in the season , which he did not think much of at the time . In October , Grove injured his other knee when he was involved in an automobile accident in Missouri . 
 The following season , Grove was provided an opportunity to be a starting pitcher for the White Sox . Over the course of the season , he started eight games and played in four more en route to a 4 – 6 record and a 5 @.@ 16 ERA . In the middle of July , Dr. Philip <unk> discovered that Grove had torn cartilage in his left knee , a result of the same injury which caused him problems for most of the season and the previous off @-@ season . Grove was scheduled for knee surgery , which necessitated two months of recovery , effectively ending his season . Issues with his knee drew concern both during and after the season . Dr. <unk> stated that Grove had a " 1 in 100 " chance of playing again , but the surgery was a success , and by season 's end Grove was able to test the knee and do light workouts . Complications arose shortly thereafter as an abscess developed on the back of his knee , prompting another operation in December to correct the problem . 
 = = Prime years = = 
 As the 1943 season began , the White Sox held strong doubts about Grove 's status as a pitcher . They were so doubtful of his recovery from knee surgery that Grove was signed to a $ 1 contract until he could prove that his playing ability was back on par with the abilities of the other White Sox pitchers . After Grove proved himself in spring training , manager Jimmy Dykes gave him his first major test of the season against the New York Yankees in relief of Eddie Smith . He won the game in extra innings , and was placed in the starting rotation . In 1943 , Grove had to deal with issues related to World War II and the selective service . He was originally classified as 3 @-@ A , meaning that registration was deferred due to hardship to dependents , but was ordered to take the selective service screening examination in Cleveland in mid @-@ May . After the examination , Grove was classified as 4 @-@ F , making him ineligible for military service , which meant that he could continue his baseball career . 
 Grove took advantage of his place in Chicago 's starting rotation by winning nine consecutive decisions to start his season and by not losing a game until a contest against the Yankees , which he lost as the result of a balk . At the time , Grove became the second member of the White Sox to win nine consecutive decisions to start a season . The first pitcher to win nine straight games for the team was Lefty Williams in 1917 , and the only one to do it since Grove was LaMarr Hoyt in 1982 . On July 8 , 1943 , Grove nearly became one of the few pitchers in baseball history to pitch a no @-@ hitter . In a game against the Yankees , he was one out away from pitching a no @-@ hitter when Joe Gordon came up to bat . Gordon hit a double to left field that was fair by inches , ending Grove 's closest bid for a Major League no @-@ hitter . Grove finished the season with career bests in ERA ( 2 @.@ 75 ) , wins ( 15 ) , and complete games ( 18 ) . He led the White Sox that season in ERA , wins , innings pitched , complete games , and strikeouts ; at the time , Grove was the youngest pitcher on the team 's staff . Grove 's personal life improved along with his career . On January 8 , 1944 , he married Catherine Sloan , having met her at a party thrown for the White Sox by her father , Francis Sloan , a year and a half earlier . 
 Grove started the 1944 season with an interesting honor : he was assigned to the 4 @-@ F All @-@ Star team , a group of 25 major league players who were the best of those exempt from military service . Grove was given the job of being the Opening Day starting pitcher for the White Sox . He pitched the first game of the season against the Cleveland Indians and their starting pitcher , Al Smith , on April 19 , 1944 , and won 3 – 1 . Grove also managed to shut out the Yankees on May 18 ; it was the first time the Yankees had not scored a run in 1944 . By mid @-@ season , Grove had seven wins , six losses , five complete games , and a 3 @.@ 40 ERA . Because of these statistics , he was selected to the American League All @-@ Star team , his first and only career appearance . Five American League pitchers pitched in the All @-@ Star Game on July 11 , although Grove was one of the four on the roster who did not ; therefore , his lone All @-@ Star appearance was indeed only an appearance . During the second half of the season , Grove performed well at Comiskey Park , but struggled on the road , at one point losing five straight games despite good run support from the White Sox . Grove finished the season with 14 wins , 15 losses , an ERA of 3 @.@ 72 , two shutouts , and a career best of nearly 235 innings pitched . 
 There was a sense of closure for Grove before the beginning of the 1945 season , as he was awarded $ 310 ( $ 4 @,@ 075 today ) in damages for the auto accident in 1941 . He held out for a new contract in the off @-@ season , and finally signed with the White Sox a couple weeks before the beginning of the season after becoming the last remaining holdout . Grove was the workhorse of the White Sox , leading the team in games pitched ( 33 ) and started ( 30 ) , while remaining the youngest pitcher on the roster . He finished the season with 217 pitched innings , a career best four shutouts , a 14 – 12 record , and a 3 @.@ 44 ERA . 
 The 1946 season saw Grove persist as a stable part of the White Sox pitching rotation . He pitched in 33 games during the season , second to closer Earl Caldwell , and started in 26 , second to Ed Lopat 's 29 . His best outing of the season occurred on August 3 against the Washington Senators . Grove pitched a complete game and threw to the minimum 27 batters , allowing three hits and a walk , all of which were negated by double plays . He finished the season with more losses than wins because he was eager to succeed and was trying too hard , and because of this the coaching staff planned to make Grove into " as good a pitcher most of the time as he is some of the time " . At the end of the 1946 season , Grove had eight wins and 13 losses , a 3 @.@ 02 ERA , 10 complete games , and a league @-@ leading 10 wild pitches . 
 = = Later career = = 
 During the off @-@ season , while preparations were underway for the 1947 season , Grove was the subject of trade discussions . Most notably , White Sox manager Ted Lyons and Cleveland Indians president Bill Veeck discussed trading him for Indians pitcher Steve Gromek , but the deal was nixed when they could not come to an agreement . As the season began , Grove remained part of the rotation , which was led by Lopat and included Joe Haynes and Frank Papish . While Grove started off the season well , he struggled through the middle of the year , going from May 18 to August 2 without winning a game . As a result , he was benched , and finished the season with 19 starts in 25 pitching appearances . For the first time , Grove finished a full season with an ERA above 4 @.@ 00 . He ended the season with six wins , eight losses , a 4 @.@ 44 ERA , and six complete games . Grove spent the off @-@ season working in the men 's furnishings department of Henry C. Lytton 's department store in Chicago . 
 In the 1948 season , the White Sox faced difficult decisions regarding their pitching staff and starting rotation . In the midst of Caldwell 's departure and Papish 's absence for most of the preseason , Grove remained a starter heading into the season , having pitched decently during spring training . In his final exhibition matchup of the season against Johnny Schmitz , Grove pitched the full nine innings and the White Sox defeated the Chicago Cubs 1 – 0 , making Grove the only White Sox pitcher to throw a complete game during the preseason . By the end of May , Grove was the lone White Sox pitcher with a complete game through the first several weeks of the season . However , Grove eventually lost his starting job , and by the end of the season , he had two wins , 10 losses , a 6 @.@ 16 ERA , and had started 11 games out of 32 total pitching appearances . 
 As the 1949 season began , Grove was again the subject of trade rumors . The Detroit Tigers agreed to trade an outfielder , presumably Don Lund or Jimmy Outlaw , in exchange for Grove , although the Tigers denied the existence of such a deal , stating " We need pitching , but I don 't think Grove would help us . " Grove pitched one game during the season on April 27 , 1949 , allowing four runs in two @-@ thirds of an inning . In his one appearance against the Indians , he hit Lou Boudreau with a pitch , which prompted concern until X @-@ rays revealed Boudreau 's left elbow was only bruised . 
 Shortly afterward , Grove was demoted to the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League , having pitched his final major league game . During his inaugural season at Sacramento , he was part of a pitching quartet that included Ken Holcombe , Bob Gillespie , and Frank Dasso , and was declared by Sporting News sportswriter John B. Old as " the best any Coast League club ever had . " Over the course of the next three seasons , Grove continued to pitch for the Solons . He was one of the workhorses of the 1950 squad , finishing the season with 17 victories . 
 His contract with the Solons promised him part of the purchase price if he was sold to the majors . When this did not occur , he considered quitting baseball and devoting himself full @-@ time to his uncle 's trucking business . However , Grove continued to play , and pitched 159 innings in 1951 , compiling an 8 – 9 record . There was talk of his retiring in the off @-@ season ; however , Grove ended up playing part of the 1952 season , making his season debut on June 10 and playing for the rest of the season . After the season ended , Grove was traded to the Portland Beavers , and refused to report , choosing instead to pitch at the semi @-@ pro level . Grove stated , " I 'm now pitching for Earl Smith Motors Pontiac sales service " , signaling the end of his professional baseball career . 
 = = Later life = = 
 After his retirement from baseball , Grove continued to work with his uncle . His legacy lived on in his nephew , Wayne Grove . While playing for the Bellwood Lions of the Chicago Little League , Wayne pitched a no @-@ hitter and struck out 15 , and narrowly missed a perfect game when a runner got on base with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning . Despite an unimpressive Major League career , Grove earned a few votes for induction into the Hall of Fame , receiving five votes in the 1958 balloting ( 1 @.@ 9 % of the required votes needed ) and seven in the 1960 balloting ( 2 @.@ 6 % of the required votes needed ) . 
 Grove had four children and four grandchildren , and later was the co @-@ owner of a car wash in Sacramento , California for 20 years . He became close friends with Joe Gordon , the player who broke up Grove 's no @-@ hitter , after moving to Sacramento . Grove died in Carmichael , California on April 20 , 1992 , and is buried alongside his wife , Catherine . 
 = 1994 – 95 South Pacific cyclone season = 
 The 1994 – 95 South Pacific cyclone season was one of the least active South Pacific tropical cyclone season 's on record , with only three tropical cyclones officially occurring within the South Pacific Ocean basin between 160 ° E and 120 ° W. The season ran from November 1 , 1994 until April 30 , 1995 with the first disturbance of the season developing on November 12 and the last disturbance dissipating on March 17 . The most intense tropical cyclone during the season was Tropical Cyclone William , which affected the Cook Islands . After the season the name William was retired , from the tropical cyclone naming lists . 
 During the season , tropical cyclones were officially monitored by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers ( TCWC ) in Nadi , Fiji , Wellington , New Zealand and Brisbane , Australia . Throughout the season the United States Navy also monitored the basin and issued unofficial warnings , through its Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) and Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center ( NPMOC ) . Tropical cyclones that were located between the Equator and 25S were monitored by TCWC Nadi while any that were located to the south of 25S were monitored by TCWC Wellington . During the season the JTWC issued warnings on any tropical cyclone that was located between 160 ° E and 180 ° while the NPMOC issued warnings for tropical cyclones forming between 180 ° and the American coast . TCWC Nadi , Wellington and Brisbane all used the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale , and measured windspeeds over a 10 @-@ minute period , while the JTWC and the NPMOC measured sustained windspeeds over a 1 @-@ minute period . 
 = = Seasonal summary = = 
 The season was one of the most inactive tropical cyclone seasons on record , with only two tropical cyclones officially occurring within the South Pacific Ocean basin between 160 ° E and 120 ° W. The first tropical depression of the season developed out of an area of convection on November 12 to the northeast of Vanuatu , before it was named Vania on November 14 after it had become a category one tropical cyclone . The cyclone went on to end a long dry spell in Vanuatu , before it last noted on November 19 to the west of Port Vila , Vanuatu . The basin remained quiet until December 13 , when Tropical Depression 04P developed to the east of the Solomon Islands , before going on to affect Fiji and Tonga . During the final days of 1994 , Tropical Cyclone William developed to the northeast of American Samoa . Throughout its lifetime , William moved southeast and affected parts of French Polynesia and the Cook Islands before becoming extratropical on January 3 . After William left the basin on January 5 , the basin remained quiet until March 16 , when Tropical Depression 18P developed near Fiji , before dissipating during the next day . After the season had ended the name William was retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists , while in June 1995 , the World Meteorological Organization made TCWC Nadi a Regional Specialized Meteorological Center .

 On November 12 , TCWC Nadi reported that a tropical depression had developed within a persistent area of convection , that was located about 795 kilometres ( 495 mi ) to the northeast of Port Vila , Vanuatu . Over the next couple of days the depression gradually developed further as it started to move towards the southwest , before the JTWC started to issue warnings on it during November 13 and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 01P after it had become equivalent to a tropical storm . Early on November 14 , as the system passed near the Solomon Island of Tikopia , TCWC Nadi reported that the system had become a category one tropical cyclone on the Australian scale , and named it as Vania . During that day as it continued to move towards the south — southwest and intensify , it started to affect Vanautu with storm force windspeeds and heavy rain which helped break a long dry spell in Vanuatu . 
 Early on November 15 , TCWC Nadi reported that Vania had become a category two tropical cyclone with peak 10 @-@ minute sustained windspeeds of between 100 km / h ( 60 mph ) , while the JTWC reported peak 1 @-@ minute sustained windspeeds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) which made it equivalent to a tropical storm . Later that day Vania passed near or over several of the Vanuatuan islands as it continued to move towards the south — southwest , and started to weaken as it encountered a higher amount of vertical windshear . During the following day , TCWC Nadi reported that Vania had weakened into a category one tropical cyclone as the systems low level circulation stalled , before it turned and started to move westwards while located to the north of New Caledonia . During November 17 , as the system had become sheared the JTWC issued their final advisory on Vania , before the systems remnant low level circulation was last noted by TCWC Nadi and the JTWC during November 19 , while it was located about 100 km ( 60 mi ) to the west of Port Vila , Vanuatu . Only minor damage to crops and bush houses was reported to have occurred in the archipelago while no deaths were reported . As a result of Vania affecting parts of Vanuatu during November 15 , voting in provincial elections had to be extended by 24 hours .

 On December 13 , the US Navy started to monitor an area of disturbed weather that was located about 720 km ( 480 mi ) , to the east of Honiara in the Solomon Islands . During that day , TCWC Nadi started to monitor the system as a tropical depression as the system moved southeast towards Fiji . Over the next couple of days , the depression continued to move southeast towards Fiji and gradually developed further . On December 15 , the NPMOC initiated advisories on the depression and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 04P , while it was located about 110 km ( 70 mi ) to the northeast of Labasa , Fiji . Later that day , the NPMOC reported that the system had become a tropical storm and reached its peak 1 @-@ minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) , as it affected several Fijian islands including Vanua Levu and <unk> . During December 16 , the cyclone continued to move towards the southeast and started to affect Tonga before the NPMOC issued their final warning on the system as it had weakened into a tropical depression . During the next day , the depression moved into TCWC Wellingtons area of responsibility and was subsequently declared extratropical .

During January 1 , TCWC Nadi reported that the depression had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it William as it passed near the Cook Island of <unk> . During the next day William subsequently slowly accelerated as it passed near too or over several other Cook Islands and intensified into a category 2 tropical cyclone . Early on January 3 , TCWC Nadi reported that the system had reached its peak 10 @-@ minute wind speeds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) as it passed near or over the French Polynesian islands of Maria and Rimatara . 
 At around the same time the NPMOC reported that William , had reached its peak 1 @-@ minute sustained windspeeds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . The system subsequently degenerated into an extratropical cyclone as it left the tropics later that day . The remnants of Tropical Cyclone William were tracked by TCWC Wellington until January 5 , as they moved south @-@ eastwards and moved out of the South Pacific basin . Throughout the Southern Cook Islands caused around US $ 2 @.@ 5 million worth of damage to crops , buildings and coconut trees and destroyed a causeway to a tourist resort on Aitutaki . William injured two people and destroyed over 150 houses in French Polynesia , where local leaders accused Météo @-@ France off underestimating Williams intensity .

During the next day , the NPMOC initiated advisories on the area of disturbed weather and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 18P , with 1 @-@ minute sustained windspeeds of 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) . During the following day as the depression did not intensify any further as it continued to move towards the southeast .

 = Taylor series = 
 In mathematics , a Taylor series is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms that are calculated from the values of the function 's derivatives at a single point . 
 The concept of a Taylor series was formulated by the Scottish mathematician James Gregory and formally introduced by the English mathematician Brook Taylor in 1715 . If the Taylor series is centered at zero , then that series is also called a Maclaurin series , named after the Scottish mathematician Colin Maclaurin , who made extensive use of this special case of Taylor series in the 18th century . 
 A function can be approximated by using a finite number of terms of its Taylor series . Taylor 's theorem gives quantitative estimates on the error introduced by the use of such an approximation . The polynomial formed by taking some initial terms of the Taylor series is called a Taylor polynomial . The Taylor series of a function is the limit of that function 's Taylor polynomials as the degree increases , provided that the limit exists . A function may not be equal to its Taylor series , even if its Taylor series converges at every point . A function that is equal to its Taylor series in an open interval ( or a disc in the complex plane ) is known as an analytic function in that interval . 
 = = Definition = = 
 The Taylor series of a real or complex @-@ valued function <formula> that is infinitely differentiable at a real or complex number <formula> is the power series 
 <formula> 
 which can be written in the more compact sigma notation as 
 <formula> 
 where <formula> denotes the factorial of n and <formula> denotes the nth derivative of <formula> evaluated at the point a . The derivative of order zero of <formula> is defined to be <formula> itself and <formula> and <formula> are both defined to be 1 . When a = 0 , the series is also called a Maclaurin series . 
 = = Examples = = 
 The Maclaurin series for any polynomial is the polynomial itself . 
 The Maclaurin series for ( 1 − x ) − 1 is the geometric series 
 <formula> 
 so the Taylor series for x − 1 at a 
 = 1 is 
 <formula> 
 By integrating the above Maclaurin series , we find the Maclaurin series for log ( 1 − x ) , where log denotes the natural logarithm : 
 <formula> 
 and the corresponding Taylor series for log ( x ) at a = 
 1 is 
 <formula> 
 and more generally , the corresponding Taylor series for log ( x ) at some a 
 = x0 is : 
 <formula> 
 The Taylor series for the exponential function ex at a = 
 0 is 
 <formula> 
 The above expansion holds because the derivative of ex with respect to x is also ex and <unk> equals 1 . This leaves the terms ( x − 0 ) n in the numerator and n ! in the denominator for each term in the infinite sum . 
 = = History = = 
 The Greek philosopher Zeno considered the problem of summing an infinite series to achieve a finite result , but rejected it as an impossibility : the result was Zeno 's paradox . Later , Aristotle proposed a philosophical resolution of the paradox , but the mathematical content was apparently unresolved until taken up by Archimedes , as it had been prior to Aristotle by the <unk> <unk> Democritus . It was through Archimedes 's method of exhaustion that an infinite number of progressive subdivisions could be performed to achieve a finite result . Liu Hui independently employed a similar method a few centuries later . 
 In the 14th century , the earliest examples of the use of Taylor series and closely related methods were given by Madhava of <unk> . Though no record of his work survives , writings of later Indian mathematicians suggest that he found a number of special cases of the Taylor series , including those for the trigonometric functions of sine , cosine , tangent , and <unk> . The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics further expanded his works with various series expansions and rational approximations until the 16th century . 
 In the 17th century , James Gregory also worked in this area and published several Maclaurin series . It was not until 1715 however that a general method for constructing these series for all functions for which they exist was finally provided by Brook Taylor , after whom the series are now named . 
 The Maclaurin series was named after Colin Maclaurin , a professor in Edinburgh , who published the special case of the Taylor result in the 18th century . 
 = = Analytic functions = = 
 If f ( x ) is given by a convergent power series in an open disc ( or interval in the real line ) centered at b in the complex plane , it is said to be analytic in this disc . Thus for x in this disc , f is given by a convergent power series 
 <formula> 
 Differentiating by x the above formula n times , then setting x = b gives : 
 <formula> 
 and so the power series expansion agrees with the Taylor series . Thus a function is analytic in an open disc centered at b if and only if its Taylor series converges to the value of the function at each point of the disc . 
 If f ( x ) is equal to its Taylor series for all x in the complex plane , it is called entire . The polynomials , exponential function ex , and the trigonometric functions sine and cosine , are examples of entire functions . Examples of functions that are not entire include the square root , the logarithm , the trigonometric function tangent , and its inverse , arctan . For these functions the Taylor series do not converge if x is far from b . That is , the Taylor series diverges at x if the distance between x and b is larger than the radius of convergence . The Taylor series can be used to calculate the value of an entire function at every point , if the value of the function , and of all of its derivatives , are known at a single point . 
 Uses of the Taylor series for analytic functions include : 
 The partial sums ( the Taylor polynomials ) of the series can be used as approximations of the entire function . These approximations are good if sufficiently many terms are included . 
 Differentiation and integration of power series can be performed term by term and is hence particularly easy . 
 An analytic function is uniquely extended to a holomorphic function on an open disk in the complex plane . This makes the machinery of complex analysis available . 
 The ( truncated ) series can be used to compute function values numerically , ( often by recasting the polynomial into the Chebyshev form and evaluating it with the <unk> algorithm ) . 
 Algebraic operations can be done readily on the power series representation ; for instance , Euler 's formula follows from Taylor series expansions for trigonometric and exponential functions . This result is of fundamental importance in such fields as harmonic analysis . 
 Approximations using the first few terms of a Taylor series can make otherwise unsolvable problems possible for a restricted domain ; this approach is often used in physics . 
 = = Approximation and convergence = = 
 Pictured on the right is an accurate approximation of sin ( x ) around the point x 
 = 0 . The pink curve is a polynomial of degree seven : 
 <formula> 
 The error in this approximation is no more than | x | 9 / 9 ! . In particular , for − 1 < x < 1 , the error is less than 0 @.@ <unk> . 
 In contrast , also shown is a picture of the natural logarithm function log ( 1 + x ) and some of its Taylor polynomials around a = 
 0 . These approximations converge to the function only in the region − 1 < x ≤ 1 ; outside of this region the higher @-@ degree Taylor polynomials are worse approximations for the function . This is similar to Runge 's phenomenon . 
 The error incurred in approximating a function by its nth @-@ degree Taylor polynomial is called the remainder or residual and is denoted by the function Rn ( x ) . Taylor 's theorem can be used to obtain a bound on the size of the remainder . 
 In general , Taylor series need not be convergent at all . And in fact the set of functions with a convergent Taylor series is a meager set in the Fréchet space of smooth functions . And even if the Taylor series of a function f does converge , its limit need not in general be equal to the value of the function f ( x ) . For example , the function 
 <formula> 
 is infinitely differentiable at x 
 = 0 , and has all derivatives zero there . Consequently , the Taylor series of f ( x ) about x = 
 0 is identically zero . However , f ( x ) is not the zero function , so does not equal its Taylor series around the origin . Thus , f ( x ) is an example of a non @-@ analytic smooth function . 
 In real analysis , this example shows that there are infinitely differentiable functions f ( x ) whose Taylor series are not equal to f ( x ) even if they converge . By contrast , the holomorphic functions studied in complex analysis always possess a convergent Taylor series , and even the Taylor series of <unk> functions , which might have singularities , never converge to a value different from the function itself . The complex function e − z − 2 , however , does not approach 0 when z approaches 0 along the imaginary axis , so it is not continuous in the complex plane and its Taylor series is undefined at 0 . 
 More generally , every sequence of real or complex numbers can appear as coefficients in the Taylor series of an infinitely differentiable function defined on the real line , a consequence of Borel 's lemma . As a result , the radius of convergence of a Taylor series can be zero . There are even infinitely differentiable functions defined on the real line whose Taylor series have a radius of convergence 0 everywhere . 
 Some functions cannot be written as Taylor series because they have a singularity ; in these cases , one can often still achieve a series expansion if one allows also negative powers of the variable x ; see Laurent series . For example , f ( x ) = e − x − 2 can be written as a Laurent series . 
 = = = Generalization = = = 
 There is , however , a generalization of the Taylor series that does converge to the value of the function itself for any bounded continuous function on ( 0 , ∞ ) , using the calculus of finite differences . Specifically , one has the following theorem , due to Einar Hille , that for any t > 0 @,@ 
 <formula> 
 Here <unk> is the n @-@ th finite difference operator with step size h . The series is precisely the Taylor series , except that divided differences appear in place of differentiation : the series is formally similar to the Newton series . When the function f is analytic at a , the terms in the series converge to the terms of the Taylor series , and in this sense generalizes the usual Taylor series . 
 In general , for any infinite sequence ai , the following power series identity holds : 
 <formula> 
 So in particular , 
 <formula> 
 The series on the right is the expectation value of f ( a + X ) , where X is a Poisson distributed random variable that takes the value <unk> with probability e − t / h ( t / h ) j / j ! . Hence , 
 <formula> 
 The law of large numbers implies that the identity holds .

 = = Calculation of Taylor series = = 
 Several methods exist for the calculation of Taylor series of a large number of functions . One can attempt to use the definition of the Taylor series , though this often requires generalizing the form of the coefficients according to a readily apparent pattern . Alternatively , one can use manipulations such as substitution , multiplication or division , addition or subtraction of standard Taylor series to construct the Taylor series of a function , by virtue of Taylor series being power series . In some cases , one can also derive the Taylor series by repeatedly applying integration by parts . Particularly convenient is the use of computer algebra systems to calculate Taylor series . 
 = = = First example = = = 
 In order to compute the 7th degree Maclaurin polynomial for the function 
 <formula> , 
 one may first rewrite the function as 
 <formula> . 
 The Taylor series for the natural logarithm is ( using the big O notation ) 
 <formula> 
 and for the cosine function 
 <formula> . 
 The latter series expansion has a zero constant term , which enables us to substitute the second series into the first one and to easily omit terms of higher order than the 7th degree by using the big O notation : 
 <formula> 
 Since the cosine is an even function , the coefficients for all the odd powers x , x3 , <unk> , <unk> , ... have to be zero .

 Then multiplication with the denominator and substitution of the series of the cosine yields

 Collecting the terms up to fourth order yields

 Comparing coefficients with the above series of the exponential function yields the desired Taylor series

 Thus , 
 <formula> 
 = = Taylor series as definitions = = 
 Classically , algebraic functions are defined by an algebraic equation , and transcendental functions ( including those discussed above ) are defined by some property that holds for them , such as a differential equation . For example , the exponential function is the function which is equal to its own derivative everywhere , and assumes the value 1 at the origin . However , one may equally well define an analytic function by its Taylor series . 
 Taylor series are used to define functions and " operators " in diverse areas of mathematics . In particular , this is true in areas where the classical definitions of functions break down . For example , using Taylor series , one may define analytical functions of matrices and operators , such as the matrix exponential or matrix logarithm . 
 In other areas , such as formal analysis , it is more convenient to work directly with the power series themselves . Thus one may define a solution of a differential equation as a power series which , one hopes to prove , is the Taylor series of the desired solution . 
 = = Taylor series in several variables = = 
 The Taylor series may also be generalized to functions of more than one variable with 
 <formula> 
 For example , for a function that depends on two variables , x and y , the Taylor series to second order about the point ( a , b ) is 
 <formula> 
 where the subscripts denote the respective partial derivatives . 
 A second @-@ order Taylor series expansion of a scalar @-@ valued function of more than one variable can be written compactly as 
 <formula> 
 where <formula> is the gradient of <formula> evaluated at <formula> and <formula> is the Hessian matrix . Applying the multi @-@ index notation the Taylor series for several variables becomes 
 <formula> 
 which is to be understood as a still more abbreviated multi @-@ index version of the first equation of this paragraph , again in full analogy to the single variable case . 
 = = = Example = = =

 Firstly , we compute all partial derivatives we need 
 <formula> 
 Now we evaluate these derivatives at the origin : 
 <formula> 
 The Taylor series is 
 <formula> 
 which in this case becomes 
 <formula> 
 Since log ( 1 + y ) is analytic in | y | < 1 , we have 
 <formula> 
 = = Comparison with Fourier series = = 
 The trigonometric Fourier series enables one to express a periodic function ( or a function defined on a closed interval [ a , b ] ) as an infinite sum of trigonometric functions ( sines and cosines ) . In this sense , the Fourier series is analogous to Taylor series , since the latter allows one to express a function as an infinite sum of powers . Nevertheless , the two series differ from each other in several relevant issues : 
 Obviously the finite truncations of the Taylor series of f ( x ) about the point x = a are all exactly equal to f at a . In contrast , the Fourier series is computed by integrating over an entire interval , so there is generally no such point where all the finite truncations of the series are exact . 
 Indeed , the computation of Taylor series requires the knowledge of the function on an arbitrary small neighbourhood of a point , whereas the computation of the Fourier series requires knowing the function on its whole domain interval . In a certain sense one could say that the Taylor series is " local " and the Fourier series is " global . " 
 The Taylor series is defined for a function which has infinitely many derivatives at a single point , whereas the Fourier series is defined for any integrable function . In particular , the function could be nowhere differentiable . ( For example , f ( x ) could be a Weierstrass function . ) 
 The convergence of both series has very different properties . Even if the Taylor series has positive convergence radius , the resulting series may not coincide with the function ; but if the function is analytic then the series converges pointwise to the function , and uniformly on every compact subset of the convergence interval . Concerning the Fourier series , if the function is square @-@ integrable then the series converges in quadratic mean , but additional requirements are needed to ensure the pointwise or uniform convergence ( for instance , if the function is periodic and of class C1 then the convergence is uniform ) . 
 Finally , in practice one wants to approximate the function with a finite number of terms , let 's say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series , respectively . In the case of the Taylor series the error is very small in a neighbourhood of the point where it is computed , while it may be very large at a distant point . In the case of the Fourier series the error is distributed along the domain of the function . 
 = The Chariot ( band ) = 
 The Chariot was an American metalcore band from Douglasville , Georgia , that existed from 2003 to 2013 . The last lineup consisted of drummer David Kennedy , vocalist and bandleader Josh Scogin , and guitarists Brandon Henderson and Stephen Harrison . The band experienced frequent lineup changes since its inception , with Scogin being the only original member . The band played an abrasive style of hardcore that does not adhere to typical stylings such as melodic / abrasive dynamics and harmonic vocals . They built a reputation around their powerful live performances , with Scogin 's lyrics covering topics like materialism , personal struggle , current events , politics , and Christian themes . Their music was critically acclaimed as something " that will melt your face and leave you wanting more . " 
 The band was formed by Scogin shortly after he left his position of vocalist in Norma Jean . In 2004 , a record deal was signed with Solid State Records and a debut album was released , titled Everything Is Alive , Everything Is Breathing , Nothing Is Dead , and Nothing Is Bleeding . The band toured constantly after that . The Chariot released the Unsung EP in 2005 , which was then followed by three successful studio albums : The Fiancée in 2007 , Wars and Rumors of Wars in 2009 , and Long Live in 2010 . The band entered the studio in May 2012 to record their fifth full @-@ length album titled One Wing which was released August 28 , 2012 . The Chariot disbanded following a farewell tour in late 2013 .

 = = = 2003 – 2004 : Formation and debut album = = = 
 The Chariot was formed by Josh Scogin almost immediately after leaving his previous band Norma Jean , a metalcore group based in Douglasville , Georgia . He recorded one album with them titled Bless the Martyr and Kiss the Child in 2002 . Later that year , following Norma Jean 's set at Furnace Fest , Scogin shocked the audience and his unaware bandmates by announcing his departure . Scogin stated that his departure was not the result of internal conflict , but a personal choice . The event generated a public outcry from fans in hardcore circles . Scogin returned to Douglasville in 2003 and started the Chariot with other musicians in the area ; the first lineup included guitarists Keller Harbin and Tony " Taco " Medina , bassist Joshua Beiser , and drummer Jeff Carter . The band 's name was inspired by the Biblical story of Elijah and the chariot of fire . 
 In 2004 , a record contract was signed with Solid State Records , a metal subdivision of Tooth & Nail Records and their first recorded song titled " It Is Usually the Boys Who Cry Wolf That Grow up to Be the Men Who Cry Sanctuary " was released on the compilation " This Is Solid State , Volume 5 " . This song was later re @-@ recorded as " Yellow Dress , Locked Knees " on their debut . The band traveled to Atlanta , Georgia and worked on their debut album with Matt Goldman . The entire album was recorded live . The album was released in November and titled Everything Is Alive , Everything Is Breathing , Nothing Is Dead , and Nothing Is Bleeding , a parody of albums that featured morbid names . The album debuted at No. 23 on Top Heatseekers , and received favorable reviews from critics . Touring followed with As Cities Burn , He Is Legend , Far @-@ less and Showbread on the Young Bloods Tour in Winter .

 Medina and Carter left the band soon after ; they were replaced by Brian <unk> and Mark Nicks respectively . Carter went on to form the progressive death metal band , Deus Invictus . Nicks was later replaced by drummer Jake Ryan . In September 2005 , The Chariot began a 27 @-@ city tour at Poughkeepsie , New York with High on Fire , Every Time I Die , and The Red Chord . An EP , titled Unsung , was released at the beginning of December . It featured two new tracks and four re @-@ recordings from their debut and was well received among critics . The band played shows with labelmates As Cities Burn , mewithoutYou , and Underoath later that month . Touring continued through 2006 as the band shared a national tour with P.O.D. in spring and garnered a spot in the Sounds of the Underground Tour with As I Lay Dying that summer . In June 2006 , Beiser and Harbin stepped down and were replaced by bassist Dan Eaton and guitarist Jon Terry respectively . The two men had been longtime friends of the band . 
 The Chariot embarked on the <unk> II Tour in fall with Solid State labelmates August Burns Red , Destroy The Runner , and Inhale Exhale . In January 2007 , the band toured through Europe with Becoming the Archetype , and Shaped by Fate . By this time , yet another bass player had been recruited — Jon " KC Wolf " Kindler . In April of the same year , after delays relating to lineup changes , their second album , The Fiancée , was released . The record was produced by Matt Goldman . The writing and recording process had been driven by time constraints . " It was actually a very easy record to write , " said Scogin , " It came more naturally to us . " However , Scogin waited until the music was written before writing lyrics , an exercise he vowed never to attempt again . Hayley Williams of Paramore made a guest performance on the track " Then Came To Kill " as did Aaron Weiss of mewithoutYou when he played the harmonica on " Forgive Me Nashville " ; Scogin had been friends with both artists for many years . The Fiancée broke the Billboard 200 — it debuted at No. 169 , selling 6 @,@ 800 copies — and was well received in the Christian and secular markets . The group played a release tour with Misery Signals , I Am Ghost , and I Hate Sally , and then made a short run on the Warped Tour in summer . Another leg of The Fiancée Tour extended into spring 2008 with <unk> , <unk> , Our Last Night , and Sky Eats Airplane . The lineup underwent another drastic change in mid @-@ 2008 , as Jake Ryan , Dan Eaton and Jon Terry all decided to step down . Ryan and Eaton went on to form the indie pop band Queens Club and were signed to Tooth & Nail Records . 
 = = = 2009 – 2010 : Wars and Rumors of Wars = = = 
 The group 's third album , titled Wars and Rumors of Wars , was released in May 2009 . The lineup changed once again , leaving Scogin as the only member to appear on their first two releases . The album title was inspired by Matthew 24 : 6 , which contains the passage " You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars ... " Scogin explained that the album title referred to internal conflict that people experience , not literal war . The band hand @-@ made the artwork and liner notes for the first 25 @,@ 000 copies of the album . Wars and Rumors of War debuted at No. 112 on the Billboard 200 , their highest to date . Critical reception was very positive about the release . The Chariot performed on the Scream the Prayer Tour with Haste the Day , Sleeping Giant , Oh , Sleeper , and Project 86 that summer . Beginning late November , The Chariot and a group of hand picked artists , including Horse the Band supported Norma Jean who headlined the nationwide Explosions 2009 Tour .

The bass on One Wing has been recorded by both Henderson and Harrison . A track from the album , " In , " premiered on Alternative Press on August 16 . 
 The Chariot had their final tour in October / November 2013 with Glass Cloud , <unk> , Birds in Row and To the Wind . 
 Josh moved on to form the band ' 68 . 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 The band 's music is characterized by a metal sound , and the screamed vocals of frontman Josh Scogin . Journalists have frequently referred to the music as " chaotic " ; Allmusic writer Alex Henderson described it as a " dense , clobbering sledgehammer " , while Brian Shultz of Alternative Press called it " manically pounding , distortion @-@ soaked exercises of catharsis " . The Chariot has often been labeled a metalcore band . However , the music generally defies genre standards like melodic / abrasive dynamics and harmonizing vocals ; it wouldn 't leave room for the " nonstop firestorm of exploding drums , heaving guitars , and visceral shrieking , " as Allmusic writer Corey Apar put it . The band utilizes time changes and start @-@ stop shifts , and typically write very short songs . Some journalists believe the music is challenging and an acquired taste . In interviews , Josh Scogin has described the band as “ heavy punk rock ” , doing away with genres and subgenres , and has also debunked many of these labels . “ Sometimes people refer to us as mathcore , which I think is a very incorrect statement , because I feel like that ’ s a very pre @-@ calculated , ‘ this is weird because this time signature doesn ’ t go with this time … ’ . It ’ s very planned out . We ’ re not that smart . ” 
 Live performances are very important to the band . " We love playing live , " said Scogin , " That 's what this band are all about : playing live shows . " This mentality leaked into their recording process : the band 's first album was recorded entirely live in one take . Their next two efforts followed more traditional recording sensibilities : " We may go in and [ fix ] this one part , " explained Scogin , " but [ ... ] there 's lots of stuff we probably should have tightened up . [ Laughs . ] But that [ keeps ] it feeling like a real record . " Despite their attentiveness to the recording process , Scogin has maintained that their focal point is live performances , " ... recording records , that 's all circled around hopefully bringing more kids to the live show so we can perform for them . " The band 's shows have built up a reputation ; MTV called them " the thing of metalcore legend " . When tasked to describe their set on the Scream the Prayer Tour in HM Magazine , Corey Erb wrote : 
 Artists who possessed strong showmanship skills have largely influenced Scogin ; some of these artists include James Brown , Frank Sinatra , Jerry Lee Lewis , and Elvis Presley . He is also fond of Arcade Fire , The Beatles , Björk , Interpol , and The Killers . In an interview , Scogin expressed a desire to have seen At The Drive @-@ In and Nirvana before they disbanded . 
 Scogin 's introspective lyrics have covered topics like materialism , death , and the Nashville Christian music industry . The lyrics for Wars and Rumors of Wars were formed after a family loss : " ... only a year ago my father passed away . And I hate to say this , because it sounds like such a band @-@ dude thing to say , but the lyrics are a lot darker than any other record just because of how personal they are for me . " Scogin usually refers to his lyrics as poems and has maintained that " a song is never finished but abandoned . " " ... as an artist you can forever be changing a song or making a song ' better ' or whatever but the moment that you stop recording and send it off to be mastered you have not ' finished ' the song … you have only abandoned the song and that is how it will stay forever . " His lyrics sometimes espouse Christian themes and beliefs , albeit subtly . For example , the track " Yellow Dress : Locked Knees " from Everything ... contains the Spanish lyrics " Jesus , yo <unk> que <unk> mundo te <unk> . " ; when translated , it says " Jesus , I want this world to know You . " The song " And Shot Each Other " from The Fiancée fades out into a Sacred Harp choir singing the song ' Child of Grace ' , which features the lyrics " How happy is a child of grace , who feels his sins forgiven / This world , he cries , is not my place / I seek a place in Heaven . " 
 The Chariot is frequently called a Christian band , which Scogin agreed with in a 2005 interview : " We are Christians in a band therefore we are a Christian band . We are not ashamed of our beliefs but we don ’ t force feed people what we believe either . " In 2006 , he reaffirmed his previous statements and further opined , " When I was growing up , if I liked [ a band ] , I listened to it — and I went to the shows . If I didn 't , I didn 't . It wasn 't like , ' Oh , they don 't believe the same thing I do , ' [ ... ] People care too much about the fashion of it all . To me , a band 's either good or they ain 't , and that 's the only thing that should matter . "

 Killer7 ( <unk> , <unk> Sebun , stylized as killer7 ) is a 2005 action @-@ adventure video game for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 , developed by Grasshopper Manufacture and published by Capcom . The game was written and directed by Goichi Suda , also known by the nickname Suda51 , and produced by Hiroyuki Kobayashi . 
 The game follows an elite group of assassins called the " killer7 " . The assassins , physical manifestations of a man named Harman Smith , perform hits on behalf of the United States government . Through these missions , the killer7 uncover a deeper conspiracy regarding the role of Japan in US politics and secrets about the nature of their organization . Killer7 features first @-@ person shooter elements and a unique on rails control scheme , but the core adventure @-@ style gameplay has been compared to Myst and Snatcher . 
 Killer7 was Suda51 's first game released outside Japan . It received polarized reviews due to its unconventional control scheme and complex noir plot . The game 's score , visual style and thought @-@ provoking story received wide praise from most critics that considered as the best aspects of the game and lead to several accolades and nominations . While some reviewers appreciated the stripped @-@ down controls and stylized arthouse approach , others panned it as confusing and restricting . Despite these setbacks , Killer7 's cult appeal led to remakes of Suda51 's older works and the successful launch of No More Heroes . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The player controls the on @-@ screen character , a member of the killer7 group , from a third @-@ person view using the gamepad . The gameplay consists of elements of first @-@ person shooter and action @-@ adventure game with restricted movement ( i.e. " on rails " ) — rather than allow free motion , the game limits the on @-@ screen character to predetermined paths through the environment . The on @-@ screen character moves forward by holding a button and reverses direction with another button press . At intersections , the player may choose which path to take . Progress is made by navigating the environment and solving puzzles . Some puzzles require the talents of a specific killer7 member . The player may switch between available members via a menu in the pause screen at any time . Other puzzles require magical rings or other items collected throughout the game . 
 Combat in Killer7 occurs when the player encounters enemies called " Heaven Smiles " . Smiles announce their presence with a laughing sound effect and are initially invisible . The player must switch to a first @-@ person viewpoint and scan the surroundings to reveal Smiles . While in first @-@ person view , movement is disabled and the analog stick aims the character 's gun . Targeting specific body parts will disable them ; for example , shooting off a leg will cause a Smile to fall to the ground and crawl toward the player . The player may aim for a " critical point " that instantly destroys the Smile . Smiles that get too close will explode and injure the character . If a character dies , players can use Garcian Smith to retrieve the fallen character 's head and bring them back to life ; if Garcian dies , then the game ends . 
 Defeated Smiles yield " thick blood " and " thin blood " . Thick blood functions similarly to experience points , and players gain more by shooting Smiles ' critical points . The player may redeem thick blood for " serum " while in " Harman 's Room " , checkpoints that appear throughout the game . Serum is used to improve the attributes of the characters such as " power " and " speed " . This also unlocks special abilities for the characters . Players may save their game to a memory card in designated Harman 's Rooms . Thin blood is used to recover the characters ' stamina and fuel special abilities .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Killer7 takes place in an alternate version of Earth in the early 21st century . After a treaty ends all international conflict , the world powers destroy all nuclear weapons by firing them into the upper atmosphere and intercepting them with other missiles . This event becomes known as " Fireworks " and symbolizes world peace to the general populace . In an effort to combat terrorism , pandemic disease , and cyberterrorism , the International Ethics Committee ( IEC ) shuts down all air travel and public use of the Internet . Air transportation is replaced by a system of intercontinental expressways . However , a new terrorist group called " Heaven Smile " appears , targeting the United Nations ( UN ) and IEC . The members of Heaven Smile are humans who have been infected with a virus that evokes a desire to kill . Factory @-@ produced Smiles are given a " bomb @-@ organ " that allows them to explode at will , their principal means of attack . 
 In this Earth , Japanese politics are dominated by two parties : the UN Party and the Liberal Party . The UN Party is more powerful and moves to end the Asian Security Treaty and sever ties with the United States ( US ) . The UN Party seized control of the Japanese government through the wisdom of the " Yakumo Cabinet Policy " , a secret document which details how to run the " ideal nation " . It was written by the Union 7 , young members of the Liberal Party who went on to found the UN Party . The US government is also eager to sever relations with Japan , seeing the country as a hindrance and of little economic value . The interaction between Japan and the US is a central source of conflict in Killer7 .

 The player controls the members of a group of assassins called the " killer7 " . The group is led by an elderly man in a wheelchair named Harman Smith , who exhibits " <unk> Personae Phenomenon " . This condition allows him to physically transform into one of his seven assassin personae : African American Garcian Smith , aggressive Irish American Dan Smith , barefoot Japanese American female <unk> Smith , albino Briton Kevin Smith , Puerto Rican Coyote Smith , young Chinese American Con Smith , and Mexican American luchador <unk> de Smith . These people were gifted killers in life and Harman absorbed their souls through his condition after their deaths . The killer7 were temporarily incapacitated in an incident 50 years ago , in which the members of the group were systematically tracked and killed while performing a job at the Union Hotel in Pennsylvania . Garcian , whose power is to revive fallen personae , became the dominant personality as a result . In this capacity , he receives orders from the frail Harman when his consciousness is " awake " and accepts jobs from Christopher Mills , who hires the killer7 on behalf of the US government . <unk> Personae Phenomenon also causes Harman and his personae to see " remnant psyches " — ghosts of their past victims . <unk> , a man in a bondage suit , and Travis Bell , the killer7 's first target , are the main remnant psyches who aid them throughout the game . The primary antagonist is an old friend of Harman 's named Kun Lan . He has the " Hand of God " , a supernatural power that produces the Heaven Smile virus . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 The game opens with a conversation between Garcian Smith and Christopher Mills about a new job for the killer7 . The assassins battle their way to the top of a building which has become infested with Heaven Smiles . Harman confronts the source of the Smiles , an angel @-@ like figure , but she is merely Kun Lan 's puppet . Harman and Kun Lan discuss the current state of the world before the mission ends . In the subsequent missions , the killer7 target a number of individuals on behalf of the US government or for personal reasons . They kill Andrei <unk> , a Texan postal worker who established a successful company based on the Yakumo , when he becomes infected with the Heaven Smile virus . Dan Smith confronts Curtis Blackburn , his former mentor and murderer , when Mills informs the group that Blackburn is running an organ trafficking business that targets young girls . Their penultimate mission pits them against the " Handsome Men " , a group of <unk> rangers who assassinate a US politician . 
 The central plot arc concerns the true nature of US – Japan relations . To distance itself from Japan , the US fires a volley of two hundred intercontinental ballistic missiles at Japan and contracts the killer7 to eliminate Toru Fukushima , the head of the UN Party . However , an assassin posing as Fukushima 's secretary kills him first in an attempt to reclaim the Yakumo document for the Liberal Party , believing its wisdom would help the party to regain political power . Shortly thereafter , <unk> Matsuoka ( nicknamed " Matsuken " ) kills two senior members of the UN Party to become its new leader , under the influence of Kun Lan . In the end , the killer7 defeat the two UN Party members who had been reanimated by Kun Lan as Japan is destroyed by the missiles . 
 In their final mission , the killer7 seek Matsuken , who leads the 10 million UN Party members who live in the US . The government fears that if they converge on a single state , they could win a seat in the United States Senate . Garcian travels to Coburn Elementary School near Seattle , Washington and discovers tapes that reveal the school as a front for the UN Party to train children as assassins . The tapes focus on Emir <unk> , a gifted killer trained at the school . Garcian encounters Matsuken , who claims that Japan has used Coburn to control the course of US politics since its founding in 1780 . The assassins battle a group of invincible Smiles and all but Garcian are incapacitated . Garcian travels to the Union Hotel where he witnesses visions of the other members being killed in their rooms . At the top , he discovers that his true identity is Emir <unk> , the one who killed the killer7 at the Union Hotel over 50 years ago . Following that incident , Harman absorbed Emir as a persona and Emir 's memories were lost . 
 Three years later , Garcian arrives at Battleship Island in Japan to destroy the last Heaven Smile . He meets with Matsuken , who presents Garcian with a choice : let him live , which allows Japan to mount an assault on the US ; or kill him , which lets the US discover Japan 's role in rigging American elections — US forces destroy Japan 's last stronghold , Battleship Island , in retaliation and wipe Japan off the map . Regardless of the player 's choice , Garcian finds that the last Heaven Smile is <unk> , whose real identity is Kun Lan , and kills him . However , Harman and Kun Lan are revealed to be immortal beings , representing a dialectic struggle between opposites , which persists a century in the future in Shanghai as they continue their eternal battle . 
 = = Development = = 
 Development for Killer7 began in mid @-@ 2002 as part of the Capcom Five , a set of games overseen by Shinji Mikami and intended to be exclusive to the Nintendo GameCube . Capcom produced the games to bring new intellectual property to the video game industry , which the company viewed as stagnant . Killer7 's gameplay mechanics were finalized late in development because most resources went to story and visual work . Director Suda51 wrote the scenario based on a plot he conceived together with Mikami , and later decided on the unconventional control scheme as a deconstruction of how gamers play and to " create new expression " . Complex controls and combos were omitted to present a system that fosters easy progression for the player . Producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi described the controls as " intuitive " and stated that the team wanted players to " think when they are playing " so they can enjoy the mystery in the story . The long development process culminated in several delays , the last of which was due to an artistic desire to release the game on July 7 ( 7 / 7 ) . 
 Suda51 drew influence from film noir , particularly the theme of multiple personality disorder , and called Killer7 a " hardboiled action @-@ adventure " . Hiro Sugiyama , Peter Saville , and American comic book artists , such as Adrian <unk> , inspired the artistic design and aesthetic . Suda51 noted the inclusion of cel animation in Western and Japanese anime styles was meant to legitimize video games as an art form by competing with traditional art forms in their stage . Kobayashi commented that Killer7 is " styled more as an interactive story than a traditional game . " Suda also drew from yakuza film Battles Without Honor and Humanity : Hiroshima Deathmatch . His experience as an undertaker had a powerful effect on the portrayal of death in his games . The game reflects his interest in professional wrestling ; Suda51 included a luchador character , <unk> de Smith , and conducted interviews and attended promotional events while wearing a lucha libre mask . Reflecting on his work , Suda51 considers Killer7 his proudest achievement . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Killer7 received divisive reviews and sparked debates about depictions of sex and violence in video games and the status of video games as art . James Mielke of 1UP.com likened the game 's high @-@ contrast art style to noir and neo @-@ noir film such as Se7en . He found that despite poor pacing and stilted gameplay , the " quirky scripting and edgy plot " were strong draws , and called Killer7 one of " most artfully designed footnotes in gaming history " . Edge magazine 's reviewers echoed this sentiment and predicted that the game would " [ pave the way ] for future creative leeway " , crediting the director with an unwavering artistic vision . Eurogamer 's Kristan Reed was keenly aware of the game 's limited appeal , calling it " a concept game , an arthouse game , a simple game , an often beautiful game , but most certainly never an everyman 's game " . Yahtzee Croshaw of The Escapist commends the game for " showing exactly what can be done when you flaunt all established convention and just start exploring what can really be done with gaming as an art form " . 
 Virtually all aspects of the game had their proponents and detractors . Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised the unity of " great @-@ looking camera work with simple controls " and compared its " thought @-@ provoking " storyline to Metal Gear Solid , while a GamePro reviewer criticized those features , calling the controls limited , the cel @-@ shading dull , and the story incoherent . Kasavin complimented the game 's eclectic soundtrack , excellent voice acting , and distinctive sound effects , while the GamePro reviewer panned them as minimalist and irritating . IGN 's Matt Casamassina likened the control scheme to " old @-@ school adventure games like Myst and Snatcher " and commended Suda51 for making a " cult hit " , " erupting with style , mood and undiluted craziness " . Casamassina was also impressed by the quality of the anime @-@ style cutscenes featured in the latter half of the game . 
 The IGN , GameSpot , and GameSpy reviews noted the GameCube version features superior graphics , substantially faster loading times , and more responsive controls than the PlayStation 2 version , resulting in lower scores for the latter . Nevertheless , IGN called it the 94th best PlayStation 2 game . Nintendo Power claimed that Killer7 is a " highly rewarding " experience for dedicated gamers . Nintendo World Report writer Karl Castaneda also remarked that , despite repetitive gameplay , it was " still fun " . Charles Herold of The New York Times was less forgiving and commented that the lack of new features beyond the first hour made the remaining experience boring and annoying . 
 Despite its mixed reception , a number of video game publications recognized Killer7 's unconventional gameplay and innovative style . At GameSpot 's " Best and Worst of 2005 " awards , the game was nominated for Best Story , Best GameCube Game , Most Outrageous Game , Most <unk> Use of <unk> Swearing , and won Best New Character ( Harman Smith ) and Most Innovative Game . IGN GameCube similarly nominated it for Game of the Year , Most Innovative Design , and Best Artistic Design and awarded it Best Adventure Game , Best Story , and Best Game No One Played . IGN later named Killer7 the 20th best GameCube game of all time . The game had a large presence at the 2005 Nintendo Power Awards , winning Best New Character ( Harman Smith ) . 
 In August 2005 , Jack Thompson , an activist who campaigns against video games , demanded that the Entertainment Software Rating Board ( ESRB ) change its rating for Killer7 from " M " ( for Mature , ages 17 and up ) to " AO " ( for Adults Only , ages 18 and up ) . He cited Casamassina 's review of the game at IGN , claiming that " full @-@ blown sex sequences " present in the game would be harmful to minors . Casamassina rebutted that the scene in question involved two fully clothed adults and that a similar scene in a film would garner " only a PG @-@ 13 or , worst , R @-@ rating " .

 Reviewers quickly identified Killer7 as a cult game with limited appeal . IGN lamented that its experimental style was not conducive to high sales , naming it GameCube 's Best Game No One Played in their 2005 awards . IGN 's Casamassina later placed it fourth in his Top 10 Tuesday : Underrated and Underappreciated Games feature . Despite modest sales , Killer7 's cult success prompted the development of remakes of Suda51 's older Japan @-@ only games , The Silver Case and Flower , Sun , and Rain . In 2007 , Grasshopper Manufacture released Suda51 's No More Heroes to critical and commercial success . In addition to an original soundtrack and comic book adaptation , Capcom published Hand in killer7 , a companion book that explains the plot in more depth . Kinetic Underground , the company that handled the comic book , also released a number of figurines depicting characters from the game .

 Killer7 Original Sound Track was released on June 20 , 2005 by Sony Music Entertainment . It features 55 compositions by Masafumi Takada and 6 by Jun Fukuda across two discs . Takada put a large emphasis on ambient music due to the genre 's ability to draw in the player . He called his soundtrack a " translation of the text " of the game and sought to retell the story through music . Carolyn Gudmundson of GamesRadar praised the soundtrack 's varied style , a " moody , <unk> base punctuated with spikes of manic energy " . She singled out " Rave On " , a track heard before mini @-@ boss battles , as an excellent example of the latter . GameSpy 's Phil Theobald had similar compliments for " Rave On " and other more subdued pieces that slowly " work [ their ] way into your mind " .

 In 2006 , Devil 's Due Publishing released a comic book adaptation of Killer7 , written and drawn by Kinetic Underground staff . The planned 12 @-@ issue limited series was cancelled after four issues . Players who preordered Killer7 through EB Games received a special " Issue # 0 " as a bonus , and " Issue # ½ " was available at the 2005 San Diego Comic @-@ Con. Writer Arvid Nelson described the story as a " mutant cross @-@ breeding of John Woo and Quentin Tarantino " , and Devil 's Due President Josh Blaylock commented that Killer7 's style was perfect for the comic book medium . In adapting the game , Nelson admitted that the plot was streamlined to maintain a comprehensible story , but noted that the " video game doesn 't spoon @-@ feed you information ... That 's how the comic 's going to be , too " . 
 = Cold Comfort ( Inside No. 9 ) = 
 " Cold Comfort " is the fourth episode of the second series of the British dark comedy anthology television programme Inside No. 9 . The episode , which was written and directed by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith , was first broadcast on 16 April 2015 on BBC Two . Most of " Cold Comfort " is composed of a stream from a fixed camera on the desk of Andy , the protagonist , with smaller pictures on the side of the screen , in the style of a CCTV feed . " Cold Comfort " was filmed over two and a half days in Twickenham , and was , like " A Quiet Night In " from Inside No. 9 's first series , highly experimental . It was Pemberton and Shearsmith 's directorial debut . 
 The episode starred Pemberton , Shearsmith , Jane Horrocks , Nikki Amuka @-@ Bird and Tony Way as volunteers at Crisis Support Line , a crisis hotline . The story follows Andy ( Pemberton ) , who is starting at the call centre . After taking a particularly disturbing call from Chloe , a suicidal teenage girl , Andy begins to struggle , but he is offered support by his supervisor George ( Shearsmith ) , the gossipy Liz ( Horrocks ) and the officious Joanne ( Amuka @-@ Bird ) . Andy is later joined by Michael ( Way ) . Vilma <unk> , Vicky Hall and members of the comedy group Gein 's Family Giftshop ( Edward Easton , Kath Hughes and James Meehan ) voiced various callers , with the Gein 's Family Giftshop comedians also appearing as on @-@ screen extras , playing unnamed call centre volunteers . 
 The television critics Andrew Billen and David Chater ( both writing for The Times ) and John Robinson ( writing for The Guardian ) characterised " Cold Comfort " as somewhat weaker than other episodes of the series , but other critics , including Patrick Mulkern ( writing for Radio Times ) , the comedy critic Bruce Dessau and writers for The Sunday Times were complimentary . Commentators praised the format , the writing and the performances , especially Horrocks 's , but offered differing views about the episode 's conclusion , plot and atmosphere . 
 = = Production = = 
 The second series of Inside No. 9 written in 2014 , and then filmed from the end of 2014 into early 2015 . The idea for " Cold Comfort " began with the call centre , with Pemberton having kept a newspaper article on the subject from 2005 as a potential inspiration . Once the writers had the idea for the setting , they allowed the story to grow out of this . The pair visited a large number of locations — including a number of colleges — before settling on the one used , which was in Twickenham , rejecting many because they did not look enough like offices . They had three days at the location , but completed filming in two and a half . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 " Cold Comfort " stars Pemberton as Andy , a new volunteer , and Shearsmith as George , Andy 's supervisor . According to Shearsmith , he and Pemberton do not typically write Inside No. 9 scripts with particular actors in mind for roles , and nor do they typically write roles specifically for themselves . They were unsure , for a long time , on which characters they should take , initially considering having Shearsmith play Andy and Pemberton play George . Shearsmith said that this felt like the more " obvious " option , but the characters were switched as they " thought it would be slightly more unusual " to have it that way around . 
 As each episode of Inside No. 9 features new characters , the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series . Jane Horrocks , Nikki Amuka @-@ Bird and Tony Way star respectively as Liz , Joanne and Michael , other volunteers at the call centre . The characters of Liz and Joanne have strongly differing approaches to their roles as volunteers , with Joanne focussing on detachment and Liz on involvement . Both approaches , for Pemberton , have advantages and disadvantages . Jane 's desk is adorned with various trinkets , including ornaments and pictures . These were Horrocks 's idea , and , for Pemberton and Shearsmith , served to make viewers suspicious of her from the start . Horrocks was chosen because she would be able to add humour while still keeping to the tight timings necessary for the episode ; many of her lines were improvised . The character of Michael begins to work at the centre during the episode . Pemberton and Shearsmith considered having it mentioned that he had been sent by " Pauline from Wood Green " , a reference to the stage version of The League of Gentlemen 's Pauline , who had been based at Wood Green . However , this was not included in the final episode . 
 Edward Easton , Vilma <unk> , Kath Hughes , James Meehan and Vicky Hall provide the voices of various people who call in to the centre . Some of the voice actors were drawn from the comedy group Gein 's Family Giftshop , the performing members of which are Hughes , Easton and Meehan . After watching a Gein 's Family Giftshop performance , Pemberton and Shearsmith had invited the members to star in Inside No. 9 . The comedians then suggested that they also appear on @-@ screen as extras , playing unnamed call centre volunteers . <unk> , who voiced " Ivy " , an old woman caller , had previously starred in Pemberton and Shearsmith 's Psychoville as Mrs Wren / Mrs <unk> . She was one of the few actors whom Pemberton and Shearsmith used in both series . 
 = = = Direction = = = 
 Pemberton and Shearsmith , in addition to writing and starring in " Cold Comfort " , directed the episode . This episode — one of two in the second series that they jointly directed — was their directorial debut . The pair did not know , while writing for the series , which episodes they would be directing , meaning that their writing was unlikely to be influenced by the knowledge . Pemberton and Shearsmith had always intended to try directing , and the second series of Inside No. 9 offered them the opportunity . David Kerr , who had directed all of the episodes in the first series , was unable to return for the second . Guillem Morales and Dan Zeff each took on directorial duties for two episodes , while Pemberton and Shearsmith decided to direct the remaining two . 
 Shearsmith said in an interview that the pair had considered directing episodes in which they did not appear much , but scheduling concerns left them with " Cold Comfort " and " Nana 's Party " ; episodes which feature the writers quite heavily . By contrast , Pemberton said that he and Shearsmith , knowing that they were going to be directing two episodes , deliberately chose " Cold Comfort " because the fixed cameras made filming a lot simpler , though Shearsmith said that the filming was more complex than they initially anticipated . For Horrocks , it was " lovely to be directed " by Pemberton and Shearsmith , as she " really [ liked ] their choices and ... [ loves ] their work " . Shearsmith said that he found directing the episode " exhausting " ; he found little time to rest during filming , as if he was not directly involved in filming , he was involved in making directorial decisions . 
 = = = Picture and sound = = = 
 The episode progresses mostly through footage streamed from a fixed camera in booth nine of the call centre setting . Streams from other cameras are displayed on the side of the screen , in the style of a CCTV feed . The idea was inspired by a clip of a serial killer 's interview with the CIA which Shearsmith had seen online ; this , too , had a main feed with three smaller feeds giving different views of the scene . The writers felt that the multiple screens both served a narrative function and raised the tension . For much of the episode , viewers simply watch characters taking calls . <unk> are seen moving back and forth in the smaller screens , with Pemberton having initially been keen for things to be happening away from the main feed . However , he was somewhat frustrated with the result , with the same extra moving on numerous occasions throughout the episode . Shearsmith felt that a whole series filmed in the same manner " would be a bit wearing on the eye " , but that the style could be used for a single episode . 
 The format presented certain technical difficulties . The episode was filmed in very long takes — some as long as five or six minutes — without any cuts . This meant that the actors could not make any errors , but the result was " something you don 't normally see " . Pemberton said that the episode would " either be brilliantly tense or incredibly boring " . Timing during filming had to be precise , though scenes could be cut earlier or start later than was anticipated . For example , an earlier introduction of Joanne was cut in the final episode . Other unused versions of scenes included a more violent version of George 's attack on Liz and a version of the final scene with a gunshot . The gunshot was removed on the recommendation of Jon Plowman , Inside No. 9 's executive producer , which led to some debate ; Shearsmith , for example , preferred the original version . 
 Alex Thompson , the episode 's sound recordist , arranged the phones so that the actors could speak to each other in real @-@ time . Pemberton and Shearsmith wanted this so that the voices would not have to be recorded in a studio later and added in ADR . The voice of " Chloe " — the identify of whom is key to the story — presented a particular technical challenge , as the writers wanted to ensure that her identity was not revealed the first time her voice is heard . First , the production team recorded Shearsmith playing George @-@ as @-@ Chloe , and then a number of actresses recorded their versions of Shearsmith playing George @-@ as @-@ Chloe . Of these , one — Hall — was chosen to lend her voice to Chloe . Shearsmith then re @-@ recorded his voice , imitating Hall 's version of George @-@ as @-@ Chloe . Hall and Shearsmith 's respective performances of George @-@ as @-@ Chloe could then be merged together for the final episode . The first time viewers hear " Chloe " , her voice is mostly Hall 's ; as the episode progresses , more of Shearsmith 's voice is audible . For Shearsmith , this did not represent the production team cheating the viewers , as viewers ' experiences are filtered through Andy 's experiences . The first time viewers hear Chloe , they — like Andy — experience her as a teenage girl . As most of the episode was filmed in real @-@ time , George is visible making calls as Chloe , meaning that he hides in plain sight . Footage of Shearsmith playing George @-@ as @-@ Chloe in George 's office — used in the final episode — was filmed separately to the rest of the episode , as a camera set @-@ up in George 's office would have been visible on one of the main cameras . 
 Pemberton compared " Cold Comfort " to " A Quiet Night In " , the second episode of the first series of Inside No. 9 , a sentiment echoed by some critics . Both episodes were highly experimental — " A Quiet Night In " being mostly silent and " Cold Comfort " being filmed mostly from a fixed camera — something which the writers felt suits anthology format . On the other hand , according to Pemberton , as " Cold Comfort " is " static and all about listening " , it is , in a sense , the " polar opposite " of " A Quiet Night In " . Though all episodes in the series were very different in tone , Pemberton felt that " Cold Comfort " was " the most extreme experiment " .

 Andy starts to volunteer at the Comfort Support Line ( CSL ) , a crisis hotline , after the death of his sister . His supervisor George takes him through the procedure for calls , and Andy chats to the more experienced Liz . He finds his first few calls difficult , and Joanne , a volunteer who shares a mutual distaste with Liz , advises him not to get emotionally invested in the callers . Andy takes a call from Chloe , a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl with problems at home . Chloe says that she has taken a drug overdose , and Andy sings " Shine " by Take That to her , but , when he finishes , Chloe is no longer on the line . He immediately takes a call from an elderly woman distraught that her cat has died , but responds insensitively , and hangs up . 
 The following day , George thinks Liz is breaking the rules by taking a personal call ; he gets angry and wrestles the handset from her . Later , Andy is upset that he listened to Chloe in her final moments , and Liz , who has made a complaint about George 's conduct , tells him that she took a call from an ex @-@ soldier , in tears because his mother committed suicide following the death of her cat . Andy realises that the man 's mother is the caller from the previous night . George advises that Andy will not face any repercussions , and asks Andy to help Michael , new to the centre , with his first call . Chloe calls in and speaks to Michael , again claiming that she has taken an overdose . Andy snatches the phone and shouts at Chloe , hanging up on her . 
 Following her argument with George , Liz is asked to leave CSL , and a small party is held in the workspace . During the party , Chloe calls the helpline again , asking to speak to Andy . Andy tells Chloe that her hoax call caused an old woman 's death , but Chloe says that this was Andy 's fault . She repeats what Andy had said to the old woman about her cat . Andy stays late in his cubicle and goes to George 's office , realising that " Chloe " must be someone who works at CSL . He accuses Joanne , who has just arrived , but she says she came back for her bag . He plans to get evidence from the CCTV footage and contact the police . Looking through CCTV footage , he and Joanne discover that it is George who made the calls . Unbeknownst to them , George is approaching the office ; he hastily leaves when he sees Andy and Joanne inside . 
 George does not arrive for work the next day . Joanne shows in a new volunteer , Glen , who is replacing Liz . Having found out that George has made similar calls to CSL for years , Andy plans to go to the police . Andy answers the phone , and it is George . In Chloe 's voice , George says that he just wanted someone to listen to him , then warns that he has told the dead woman 's son where Andy works . In the background , Glen stands , and points a gun at Andy 's head .

 Critics responded positively to " Cold Comfort " , though several characterised it as weaker than previous episodes in the series . David Chater , writing in The Times , described " Cold Comfort " as " a breather " after the " small masterpieces " of " The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge " and " The 12 Days of Christine " . He said that " Cold Comfort " offers " a promising set @-@ up , but ... doesn 't unfold with the same simple , logical elegance as others in the series " . Andrew Billen , also writing for The Times , gave the episode three out of five stars , considering it weaker than is typical for Inside No. 9 . John Robinson , who reviewed the episode for The Guardian , felt that though " the episode has the tools to ratchet up the suspense " , it " lacks both the plausibility and element of surprise that characterise the best of this series " . 
 Patrick Mulkern , on the other hand , who was writing for the Radio Times , described " Cold Comfort " as " warped brilliance " . He said that " any real helpline volunteers watching this episode may well wince , but it remains gripping throughout " . Reviewers in The Sunday Times called the episode " another corker " , and the freelance journalist Dan Owen called the episode " easily the funniest " since " La Couchette " , awarding it three out of four stars . He characterised it as mostly successful in its aims , and summarised it as a " memorable " and " well @-@ executed " comedy @-@ drama . 
 Robinson felt that the writers had " dial [ ed ] back the celebrity guests " for the episode , while Phoebe @-@ Jane Boyd , writing for the entertainment website Den of Geek , said that the episode " had another set of fantastic guest stars " . The comedy critic Bruce Dessau praised the performances in the episode ; Billen said that Horrocks 's performance was " particularly good " , and critics in The Sunday Times said that Horrocks was " on fine form " . Commentators also commended the episode 's writing , though Owen felt that the plot took a while to " get going " . 
 The television critic Julia Raeside discussed the unusual style of " Cold Comfort " , saying that " You could argue [ that the writers ] are at the stage in their careers where they don 't need to experiment . No one else makes television like them and yet still they push themselves . " For Clare Murphy , writing in the Daily Mirror , the episode " makes great use of CCTV split @-@ screen footage " . Dessau said that the set @-@ up gave the episode " its haunting flavour " . Viewers do not just see Andy , but also streams from other cameras , which , for Dessau , " makes the viewer both intrigued and anxious " . Boyd , too , claimed that the episode played on the " inherent creepiness " of CCTV footage . She said that the split @-@ screen set @-@ up increased the tension , and that the " gimmick is a good one " ; though it could " have worked well as a pleasing novelty on its own , [ it ] also makes this ' whodunit ' / ' who 's doing it ' a refreshingly inventive take on the genre " . 
 Critics writing for The Sunday Times said that set @-@ up " proves very effective for the denouement " , which Mulkern described as " a creepy pay @-@ off " . Chris Bennion of The Independent said that the ending was testament to the fact that the writers " know how to play their audience like a fiddle " . Billen was less impressed , saying that " the ultimate twist in the tale was crude , and the insight that those who offer help need it most just a little banal - by this series ' standards , at least " . Owen , similarly , found the motives of " Chloe " unconvincing , and considered " the surprisingly nihilistic final shot perhaps not fully earned or plausible " , but confessed that the episode was able to " outmanoeuvre [ sic ] " him , as he did not foresee the ending .

 = Barbeyella minutissima = 
 Barbeyella minutissima is a slime mould species of the order Echinosteliales , and the only species of the genus Barbeyella . First described in 1914 from the Jura mountains , its habitat is restricted to montane spruce and spruce @-@ fir forests of the Northern Hemisphere , where it has been recorded from Asia , Europe , and North America . It typically colonises slimy , algae @-@ covered logs that have lost their bark and have been partially to completely covered by liverworts . The sporangia are roughly spherical , up to 0 @.@ 2 mm in diameter , and supported by a thin stalk up to 0 @.@ 7 mm tall . After the spores have developed , the walls of the sporangia split open into lobes . The species is one of the smallest members of the Myxogastria and is considered rare . 
 = = Taxonomy and classification = = 
 The species was first described in 1914 by Charles Meylan on the basis of a collection made at an altitude of 1 @,@ 400 metres ( 4 @,@ 600 ft ) from the Swiss Jura in September the year before . Meylan thought the species warranted a new genus based on the unique mode of dehiscence and the makeup of the capillitium . The genus was named for the Swiss botanist William Barbey ( 1842 – 1914 ) . It and the genus <unk> together make up the family <unk> . Studies of the ultrastructure of the sporocarps suggests that Barbeyella occupies a systematic position intermediate between Echinosteliales and the Stemonitales . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The protoplasmodium , a microscopic , undifferentiated granular mass with a slime sheath , is transparent and colourless . A single sporangiophore ( the fruiting structure ) is produced from the <unk> protoplasmodium , which is approximately one and a half times the diameter of mature sporangia . It acquires dark spots as it matures and the centre of the protoplasm later becomes dark . Then , the transparent and milk @-@ white protoplasmodium climbs along the stem to the top , where first the capillitium and peridium and finally the spores are produced . At room temperature , this process lasts roughly one day . 
 The long @-@ stemmed , blackish @-@ brown or blackish @-@ purple , barely translucent sporangia of Barbeyella are spherical , 0 @.@ 15 to 0 @.@ 2 mm in diameter and together with the stem measure 0 @.@ 3 to 0 @.@ 7 mm long . They are usually scattered on the substrate , but also often grouped in loose , large colonies . The <unk> ( the tissue upon which the sporangiophore rests ) has a diameter of at least 0 @.@ 7 mm . Although not visible on mosses , it has a reddish @-@ brown color when growing on wood . The brownish @-@ black stem is up to 0 @.@ 1 mm thick , thinning to 5 µm towards the top and is filled with <unk> scrap material . The columella – arising from the stem tip – matures at the upper end at roughly half the height of the sporangiophore into 7 to 13 simple or occasionally bifurcated , 1 to 4 µm large , dark @-@ brown capillitium strands . Usually individual , occasionally in pairs , these are firmly fused with the lobed segments of the peridium , which are round in cross @-@ section . When the spores mature , the sporangium splits and empties into the peridium towards the base . This prevents the lobes of the peridium from detaching and provides spore dispersal over a longer period , similar to a <unk> capsule . The sporangia are filled towards the top with <unk> granules , which diminish increasingly towards the base . Depending on the size of the <unk> granules , the sporangia appear papillate or smooth . 
 The mass of spores is blackish brown , or brown if viewed under polarised light . The surface texture ranges from almost smooth to warty , and the spores measure 7 – 9 µm in diameter . Material collected from Oregon , however , varies from European material in several ways : the fruit body is brown ; the branching of the capillitium from the columella differs ( having primary and secondary branches instead of radiating branches from an expanded tip ) ; the spore mass is tan , and individual spores measure 10 – 12 µm . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Barbeyella minutissima is considered rare . Its habitat corresponds to the mountainous spruce @-@ fir forests of the Northern Hemisphere . It is largely restricted to altitudes between 500 and 2 @,@ 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 and 8 @,@ 200 ft ) , occasionally appearing as low as sea level and as high as 3 @,@ 500 metres ( 11 @,@ 500 ft ) . It has been found in Europe ( Finland , Germany , Switzerland , Poland , Romania , Latvia , and Russia ) , in west and east North America ( Washington , Oregon , California , and Mexico ; North and South Carolina and Virginia ) , in the Indian Himalayas as well as in Japan . It is relatively common in fir forests on high @-@ altitude Mexican volcanoes , suggesting that air @-@ borne spore dispersal is effective . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 The species grows only on slightly to heavily rotten and <unk> deadwood in coniferous forests in cool , moist areas . The wood is about 40 to 100 % overgrown with Marchantiophyta , especially of the genera <unk> or <unk> . B. minutissima has been found growing on the liverwort <unk> <unk> , although <unk> <unk> is the main indicator for the slime mould . In addition to liverworts , Barbeyella is found socialised with monocellular algae . It is assumed that the protoplasmodium <unk> either the algae or the bacteria on their surface . Other Myxogastria species are often found together with Barbeyella , especially <unk> tigrinum , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . <unk> album is a <unk> fungus ( i.e. , living on or within the fruit bodies of myxomycetes ) that has been reported growing on specimens of B. minutissima collected from North Carolina .

 " Hollywood A.D. " is the nineteenth episode of the seventh season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on April 30 , 2000 . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Hollywood A.D. " earned a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 7 , being watched by 12 @.@ 88 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode was met with largely positive reviews , with many critics approving of the episode 's humorous nature . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Wayne Federman , an entrepreneurial Hollywood producer and college friend of Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) picks up the idea for a film based on the X @-@ Files , however Mulder and Scully find that the level of realism in their fictional portrayal is somewhat questionable . Meanwhile , during the filming of the movie , Mulder and Scully research the mysterious " Lazarus Bowl " , an artifact that supposedly has the words Jesus Christ spoke when he raised Lazarus from the dead . 
 " Hollywood A.D. " was written and directed by series star David Duchovny , his second writing and directing credit after the sixth season episode " The Unnatural . " The episode — written with a " self @-@ referential " tone — features a myriad of guest stars , including , most notably , Garry Shandling and Téa Leoni , who portray Mulder and Scully , respectively , in the episode 's fictional movie . The episode itself contains several in @-@ jokes and references deliberately placed by Duchovny . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Walter Skinner 's old college friend , Hollywood producer Wayne Federman , is involved in a film project about the FBI . During Federman 's research phase , Skinner gives him access to Fox Mulder and Dana Scully , who are investigating the attempted murder of Cardinal O 'Fallon . Federman tags along and constantly interrupts the agents . While searching the catacombs of O 'Fallon 's church , Mulder finds the remains of Micah Hoffman , a missing 1960s counter @-@ <unk> . Searching Hoffman 's apartment , they find bombs and counterfeiting tools , as well as forged gospel of Mary Magdalene . Mulder and Federman return to the church and search the catacombs , finding several skeletons and pieces of the forged gospel . Federman wanders off and stumbles upon animated bones , who attempt to assemble a shattered piece of pottery . He panics and leaves the scene . 
 Mulder and Scully examine the pottery . Scully tells Mulder the story of " The Lazarus Bowl " , in which the aunt of Lazarus had been making a clay bowl when Jesus Christ resurrected him . The words of Christ were then recorded in the grooves of the bowl , much like a phonograph record . Mulder brings the relic to Chuck Burks , who , after performing a sonic analysis , discovers voices in Aramaic ; in one portion part of the audio , one man commands another to rise from the dead . The other contains lyrics from " I am the Walrus " by The Beatles . 
 Mulder visits O 'Fallon , who admits he bought the forged gospel from Hoffman , but believed it was real . Meanwhile , during Hoffman 's autopsy , Scully experiences a vision wherein he comes back to life on the operating table and begins talking . Later , at the church , Scully sees a vision of Hoffman in Jesus ' place on a large crucifix . Mulder arrests O 'Fallon for Hoffman 's murder , but Micah Hoffman walks in , unscathed . He tells the agent that while he initially created the forgeries to make money , he came to believe he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ , and bombed the church to get rid of the " blasphemous " forgeries . Skinner suspends Scully and Mulder for four weeks because of the mix @-@ up . Sixteen months later , O 'Fallon kills Micah Hoffman in a murder @-@ suicide . As such , the X @-@ File is never truly solved . 
 During their suspension , Mulder and Scully venture to Hollywood to view the production of Federman 's film . It is revealed that Federman 's movie will be called The Lazarus Bowl , and Garry Shandling will play Mulder and Téa Leoni will play Scully . After filming is done , Mulder and Scully attend a screening of the film with Skinner , but are thoroughly disgusted at how their case , and they , are portrayed on the big screen . Mulder and Scully leave the set holding hands , presumably on their way to dinner with the FBI credit card Skinner gave them after watching the movie , hinting at the continued romantic relationship between Mulder and Scully that has been suggested in the last few episodes . As the agents leave , the dead who were resting underneath the film set are revived and begin to dance passionately , reinforcing a theory Mulder made earlier in the episode .

 " Hollywood A.D. " was written and directed by series star David Duchovny . The episode was written after Duchovny received positive feedback on his last creation , season six 's " The Unnatural " . Duchovny originally approached executive producer Frank Spotnitz about the possibility of writing another episode . Spotnitz gave him the go @-@ ahead and was soon given a rough copy of the script . Series creator Chris Carter was very happy with the story , calling it " a smart , [ ... ] , quirky , and intelligent idea " and he later described it as " outside the norm , even for The X @-@ Files . " Once the script was approved , Duchovny took on an active role in preparing for the episode . 
 There was a considerable amount of stunt work and choreographing done for " Hollywood A.D. " Two stunt doubles were hired for the scene where Shandling tackles Leoni and they tumble down a hill into an open casket . Some of the stunt men were even cast in non @-@ stunt related jobs . Several were " transformed " into zombies , a process which took five hours . The zombie dance sequence at the end of the episode took two days to film . The first day was shot during active production and the second was scheduled for the blue screen work that was required . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Duchovny cast several of The X @-@ Files ' technical crew members in the episode . Tina M. <unk> , the show 's actual craft services woman , portrayed Tina , the craft service woman for Wayne Federman 's movie . Bill Roe , the show 's photography director , was cast as the vegetarian zombie . Assistant director Barry K. Thomas was cast as one of the men on the movie set , Paul Rabwin was cast as a producer , and special effects coordinator Bill Millar was cast as the movie 's director . Duchovny also cast his brother , Daniel , as the assistant director . Several of the family members and friends cast by Duchovny were able to apply for their Screen Actor 's Guild card and were able to apply for a health insurance plan . 
 Téa Leoni , who portrayed a fictionalized version of herself portraying Scully in the production , was married to David Duchovny when this episode was filmed , a decision casting director Rick Millikan considered " clever . " Duchovny also cast his friend and fellow actor Garry Shandling as a fictionalized version of himself portraying Mulder . Shandling had originally been sought out to play the part of Morris Fletcher in the sixth season episode " Dreamland . " The joke about Garry Shandling having a crush on Mulder came from a recurring joke from the TV show The Larry Sanders Show , starring Shandling . In the recurring joke , David Duchovny has a homosexual interest in Shandling 's character . 
 The joke about Mulder wanting Richard Gere to appear in the movie stemmed from the fact that Duchovny 's acting was often compared to Gere 's . Duchovny decided to turn the idea into a joke , saying , " we used to always have the joke on set that when they do the movie it 's going to be Richard Gere and Jodie Foster [ playing Mulder and Scully ] . So I originally wrote the teaser for Richard Gere and Jodie Foster and I just started to think about it and you know , it 's so much funnier with Garry and Téa . " The episode featured several uncredited celebrity cameos . During the premiere of the movie , Duchovny 's Return to Me costars Minnie Driver and David Alan Grier appear as members of the audience . In addition , Chris Carter , the show 's creator , made a cameo during the theater scene . The appearance was his second in the series .

 Asher Vollmer ( born September 14 , 1989 ) is an American indie video game developer and creator of Puzzlejuice and Threes . He created the 2012 iOS game Puzzlejuice while a student at USC Interactive Media & Games Division . The game began his collaboration with Greg Wohlwend . The pair 's next release , the 2014 iOS puzzle game Threes , received what review aggregator Metacritic described as " universal acclaim " , including perfect scores from Eurogamer and TouchArcade , and the title of Apple Inc . ' s iPhone game of the year . The game was later ported to multiple platforms . Polygon included Vollmer in their " 50 admirable gaming people " of the year for his work on Threes . Among other projects , Vollmer subsequently worked on Close Castles , a real @-@ time strategy game later put on hiatus , and Royals , a simulation game for OS X and Windows . 
 = = Career = = 
 Vollmer is a graduate of the USC Interactive Media & Games Division program . As a student , he began work on Puzzlejuice , a puzzle video game . He reached out to artist Greg Wohlwend for aesthetic advice , which led to a collaboration between the two . Puzzlejuice is a combination of Tetris , tile @-@ matching , and Boggle : players rearrange falling tetromino blocks into rows of similar colors , which turn into letters that are cleared from the board by forming words . The iOS game was released on January 19 , 2012 , to what review aggregator Metacritic described as " generally favorable " reviews . Multiple reviewers mentioned the difficulty in mentally balancing the various components of the game . 
 Vollmer started as thatgamecompany 's " feel engineer " in August 2012 , but left in April 2013 to " go indie " and work on his own projects . On his blog , he said he thought the studio 's current project would be groundbreaking , though he was unhappy working there . Vollmer tried to write a short story in an attempt to take a break from games . Before long , he began to play with his computer keyboard . Vollmer challenged himself to make a game that only used the arrow keys , and prototyped what would become Threes in ten hours overnight . He proceeded to iterate on the idea with Wohlwend over the game 's 14 @-@ month development . In Threes , the player slides numbered tiles on a four @-@ by @-@ four grid to combine addends and multiples of three . Vollmer cited Drop7 as an inspiration for the game , having played it for two years beforehand . 
 Threes had no original inclination towards minimalism . In fact , Vollmer and Wohlwend felt that the game needed to appear more complex so as to interest players . They returned to the original idea and added character personalities to the tiles . The iOS game was released on February 6 , 2014 , to what Metacritic characterized as " universal acclaim " . Reviewers found the game " charming " and " addictive " , and compared it to Drop7 ( 2009 ) , Triple Town ( 2010 ) , and Stickets ( 2013 ) . Eurogamer and TouchArcade awarded the game perfect scores , with the latter calling Threes " about as close as it gets to a perfect mobile game " . Other developers released similar games and clones within weeks of the game 's launch . Apple named Threes its best iPhone game of 2014 . The game was later ported to Android , Xbox One , and Windows Phone platforms . Polygon included Vollmer in their " 50 admirable gaming people of 2014 " for his work on Threes . 
 Vollmer thought he would work on a new game a month after releasing Threes , but was kept busy by obligations to fix and update the game , to port it to other platforms , and to promote game through press and events . He was convinced that he would never make a game " as clean and tight as Threes ever again " . Vollmer 's next game was Close Castles , a real @-@ time strategy game . 
 = = = After Threes = = = 
 Vollmer unveiled Close Castles in June 2014 . Players start in corners of a " grid map " and are represented by castles . Vollmer explained that the game 's name is from castles built too close to one another , starting a mutually assured destruction scenario . Players can build three structure types out from their castle : towers that fire at incoming enemies ( defense ) , houses that make " loyal subjects " ( offense ) , and markets that make money ( economy ) . The " A " button with a direction constructs a path directing followers to the enemy . Followers capture enemy structures as denoted by a " defense bar " that fills as followers enter the structure and that destroys the structure when filled . Markets are the weakest structure , and two towers can defend against one house . Player turf grows as player structures approach the limits of their area . Players earn five units of money a second , which increases by five for every market . Polygon called the game 's simple visual design " horrifyingly deceptive " . Vollmer has said that games should last around three minutes apiece and that the local multiplayer 's lack of " hidden information " should make interactions with other players less of a " sadomasochistic " game of waiting for an opponent to concede . The game was demoed on an Xbox 360 but was planned for release on the PlayStation 4 . Vollmer put the project on hold while he worked out " fundamental flaws " in the gameplay . 
 While Vollmer traditionally worked on multiple games at once , Close Castles was his only project when it was in production . In March 2015 , he worked three days a week on a bigger project with a small team , and saved his other days for personal experimentation and Threes bugs . The next month , Vollmer released Royals , a pay what you want simulation game for OS X and Windows . The player controls a peasant who advances towards royal status by collecting resources and followers . Every player decision counts as a year of the peasant 's life . Polygon 's Megan Farokhmanesh described the game as difficult and charming , with a " quirky , subtle humor " . The game was designed to be " purposefully difficult and obtuse " and " nothing like Threes " . Eurogamer 's Jeffrey Matulef wrote that the gameplay was like a " comically minimalist roguelike " for its emphasis on resource management and short player lifespans .

 The Battle of Unsan ( Hangul : <unk> ; hanja : <unk> ; RR : Unsan <unk> ; MR : Unsan <unk> 'u ) , also known as the Battle of Yunshan ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> Shān Zhàn Dòu ) , was a series of engagements of the Korean War that took place from 25 October to 4 November 1950 near Unsan , North Pyongan province in present @-@ day North Korea . As part of the Chinese First Phase Campaign , the People 's Republic of China 's People 's Volunteer Army made repeated attacks against the Republic of Korea 1st Infantry Division near Unsan beginning on 25 October , in an attempt to take advancing United Nations forces by surprise . In an accidental first encounter with the United States military during the Korean War , the Chinese 39th Corps attacked the unprepared US 8th Cavalry Regiment in Unsan on 1 November , resulting in one of the most devastating US losses of the Korean War . 
 = = Background = = 
 By October 1950 , the United Nations ( UN ) forces had successfully broken out of the Pusan Perimeter in the extreme south of Korea and begun an aggressive northward advance towards the Sino @-@ Korean border , chasing the retreating Korean People 's Army ( KPA ) . The US 1st Cavalry Division entered Pyongyang on 19 October , while the Republic of Korea Army ( ROK ) were rushing towards the Yalu River in all directions . As part of the Thanksgiving Offensive to end the war , Major General Frank W. Milburn , commander of the US I Corps , ordered the ROK 1st Infantry Division to secure the Sup 'ung Dam on the Yalu River by advancing through Unsan . 
 Alarmed by the rapid collapse of the KPA , China 's Chairman Mao Zedong ordered the People 's Liberation Army 's North East Frontier Force to be reorganized into the People 's Volunteer Army ( PVA ) for the upcoming intervention in Korea . Despite Mao 's determination to save North Korea from capitulation , the Chinese military leadership expressed doubts on the ability of the Chinese army to fight against the more modernized US forces . As a compromise , Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign , a bridgehead building operation with limited offensives against only the South Korean forces while avoiding contacts with the US forces . Under strict secrecy , the PVA entered Korea on 19 October .

Those two roads formed the only retreat routes for the UN forces at Unsan .

 Acting on Milburn 's instruction , the ROK 1st Infantry Division advanced north on 24 October with the ROK 6th Infantry Division on its right and the US 24th Infantry Division on its left , and by the morning of 25 October , the ROK 1st Infantry Division had captured Unsan . But with the UN forces spread thinly across Korea , a 15 mi ( 24 km ) gap was left between the US 24th Division and ROK 1st Division , leaving the Korean left flank unprotected . 
 Upon noticing the thinly held UN frontline , the Chinese decided to launch a pincer movement against the South Koreans at Unsan . As part of the First Phase Campaign , the PVA 120th Division of the 40th Corps was at first to block and hold the ROK 1st Infantry Division at Unsan . Simultaneously , the bulk of the 40th Corps , together with the PVA 38th Corps and one division from the 42nd Corps , would attack and destroy the ROK 6th and 8th Infantry Divisions at the east of Unsan . Finally , the PVA 39th Corps would destroy the ROK 1st Infantry Division by infiltrating the gap between US 24th Division and the ROK 1st Infantry Division west of Unsan . Undetected by UN intelligence , the 120th Division arrived at the blocking position on 24 October , with its 360th Regiment heavily fortified the hills north of Unsan . To obscure troop movements and to prevent UN air raids , the Chinese also started several forest fires around the end of October .

 On 25 October at 10 : 30 , the ROK 1st Infantry Division attacked north with its 12th Regiment on the western bank of Samtan River while the 15th Regiment was trying to reach the eastern bank . But when the 15th Regiment was about to cross the river , the PVA 120th Division intercepted the South Koreans with heavy artillery fire . The South Koreans first believed the resistance to be the last remnants of the KPA , but the perception soon changed with the capture of the first Chinese prisoner in the Korean War . The prisoner revealed that there were 10 @,@ 000 Chinese soldiers waiting to join the fight north of Unsan . 
 Faced with the sudden appearance of the overwhelming Chinese forces , the ROK 1st Infantry Division tried to establish defensive positions by capturing the hills around Unsan . The South Koreans soon found themselves in a seesaw battle with the PVA 360th Regiment during the night of 25 October . The next day , the PVA 39th Corps arrived at the west of Unsan while cutting the road between Unsan and Yongsan @-@ dong , completely surrounding the ROK 1st Infantry Division . Aided by airdrops , the US 6th Medium Tank Battalion and the US 10th Anti @-@ Aircraft Artillery Group , the ROK 1st Infantry Division reopened the road on 27 October . Several more attempts to advance north by the Koreans made little progress , and the fighting stopped by 28 October . 
 Despite the warnings given by Brigadier General Paik Sun Yup , commander of the ROK 1st Infantry Division , a general feeling of optimism about the outcome of the war prevented the warnings from being taken seriously . With the fighting reached a stalemate at Unsan , General Walton Walker of the Eighth United States Army ordered the US 8th Cavalry Regiment of the US 1st Cavalry Division to resume offensives north by relieving the ROK 12th Regiment . By the time the US 8th Cavalry Regiment reached Unsan on 29 October , the ROK 11th Infantry Regiment of the ROK 1st Infantry Division was also pulling out of Unsan . At the same time , the Chinese had destroyed the ROK 6th Infantry Division on the east of Unsan . Unsan had now became a northern salient in the UN line containing only the US 8th Cavalry Regiment and the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment . 
 = = = Chinese counterattack = = = 
 Still believing that the ROK 1st Infantry Division was tied up at Unsan , PVA Commander Peng Dehuai gave the go ahead for the 39th Corps to destroy the Unsan garrison on 1 November . The Chinese plan called for the PVA 117th Division to attack from the northeast , the 116th Division to attack from the northwest and the 115th Division to attack from the southwest . At the same time , the US 8th Cavalry Regiment had taken up positions around the town , with its 1st Battalion defending the north of Unsan by the Samtan River , while its 2nd and 3rd Battalions defending the areas west of the Unsan by the <unk> River . The lack of UN manpower , however , created a 1 mi ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) gap between the 1st and 2nd Battalions . The ROK 15th Infantry Regiment , on the other hand , had dug in northeast of the Unsan , across the river from the US 1st Battalion . 
 In the early afternoon of 1 November , a combat patrol from the US 5th Cavalry Regiment , rear guard of the 8th Cavalry Regiment , was intercepted by PVA <unk> Regiment of the 115th Division at Bugle Hill . With the trap discovered , the Chinese immediately launched their attacks at 17 : 00 . Supported by rocket artillery , the 117th Division attacked the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment in full force while four Chinese battalions from the 116th Division struck the gap between the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the US 8th Cavalry Regiment . By 23 : 00 , the heavy fighting destroyed the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment while the US 1st and 2nd Battalions were running out of ammunition . As the UN forces began to buckle around Unsan , Milburn finally ordered the garrison to withdraw after learning the destruction of the ROK 6th Infantry Division on the right flank . 
 Before the withdrawal could be carried out , however , the PVA 347th Regiment of the 116th Division had already entered the town of Unsan through the gap between the American battalions . Soon afterward , several roadblocks appeared behind the US 1st and 2nd Battalions . With the attacks gaining momentum , the PVA 348th Regiment of the 116th Division advanced southward from Unsan , ambushing the UN forces at the road junction by 02 : 30 . With all the roads blocked , the US 8th Cavalry Regiment 's 1st and 2nd Battalions had to escape by infiltrating the Chinese lines in small groups , abandoning most of their vehicles and heavy weapons along the way . The surviving US and ROK soldiers reached UN lines by 2 November . 
 While the US 8th Cavalry Regiment 's 1st and 2nd Battalions were under heavy attack , its 3rd Battalion was left alone for most of the night , but by 03 : 00 , a company of Chinese commandos from the 116th Division managed to infiltrate the battalion command post disguised as ROK soldiers . The following surprise attack set many vehicles on fire while causing numerous casualties among the Americans , most of whom were still sleeping . By the time the confusing fighting had ended , the 3rd Battalion was squeezed into a 200 yd ( 180 m ) wide perimeter by the PVA 345th Regiment of the 115th Division . The US 5th Cavalry Regiment made repeated attempts to rescue the 3rd Battalion by attacking the PVA <unk> Regiment at Bugle Hill , but after suffering 350 casualties , the 5th Cavalry was forced to withdraw under orders from Major General Hobart Gay , commander of the US 1st Cavalry Division . The trapped 3rd Battalion endured days of constant attacks , and the surviving soldiers managed to break out of the perimeter by 4 November . By the end of the battle , less than 200 survivors from the 3rd Battalion managed to return to the UN line . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Immediately after the success at Unsan , the rest of the Chinese forces advanced across the US lines , intending to push the US forces back across the Ch 'ongch 'on River and into Pyongyang . But food and ammunition shortages soon forced the Chinese to disengage on 5 November , thus ending the Chinese First Phase Campaign . Besides the victory at Unsan , the Chinese First Phase Campaign also destroyed the ROK 6th Infantry Division and one regiment from the ROK 8th Infantry Division at the Battle of Onjong . In return , the Chinese had suffered 10 @,@ 700 casualties by the end of the Chinese First Phase Campaign . The Battle of Unsan has been considered to be one of the most devastating US losses of the Korean War . 
 The Chinese victory at Unsan was as much of a surprise to the Chinese leadership as it was to the UN forces . The accidental encounter between the Chinese and US forces at Unsan eased the fear of the Chinese leadership about intervening in Korea , while the performance of the US 1st Cavalry Division was studied in great detail by Chinese commanders . For the UN forces , on the other hand , despite the heavy losses suffered by the US Eighth Army at Unsan , the unexpected Chinese withdrawal made the United Nations Command believe that China did not intervene in Korea on a large scale . PVA Commander Peng Dehuai incorporated the lessons from Unsan for the upcoming Second Phase Campaign , while General Douglas MacArthur launched the Home @-@ by @-@ Christmas Offensive under the assumption that only a weak Chinese force was present in Korea , resulting in the decisive battles at the Ch 'ongch 'on River and the Chosin Reservoir later that year .

 On March 1 , 2011 , Rihanna asked fans to help her choose the next single from Loud using Twitter , saying that she would film a music video within the next couple of weeks . After an influx of suggestions , the singer said she had narrowed the options down to four songs : " Man Down " , " California King Bed " , " Cheers ( Drink to That ) " and " Fading " . On March 12 , she confirmed that " California King Bed " had been selected as the next international single . However , the releases were switched , and " Man Down " was sent to rhythmic and urban radio stations in the United States on May 3 – before the May 13 release of " California King Bed " – making " Man Down " and " California King Bed " the fifth and sixth singles from Loud .

 Andy Gill of The Independent and Ryan Dombell from Pitchfork Media both noted that the song embodies all the elements of a big power ballad , with the former stating that it is " Rihanna 's best vocal performance " and the latter concurring , labeling the song as a " ' I Don 't Want to Miss a Thing ' type power ballad genetically engineered to soundtrack a bi @-@ coastal Kate Hudson rom @-@ com . " Daniel Brockman of Boston Phoenix writer perceived the song as an " innocuous soft jam . " Slant Magazine 's Sal Cinquemani called " California King Bed " a " slushy acoustic ballad whose clever metaphor is all but suffocated beneath the song 's cheesy production choices " Andy Gill of The Independent , gave a positive review for the song saying that it contained Rihanna 's best vocal performance to date . However , Robert Copsey of Digital Spy criticized her vocals , stating that " She [ Rihanna ] belts out in a range well beyond her natural vocal ability . " 
 Scott Shetler of Popcrush commented that it was refreshing to see Rihanna release a down @-@ tempo ballad , instead of a continuous flow of up @-@ tempo dance songs , saying " Though ‘ California King Bed ’ follows a routine pop ballad arrangement , the song is a nice change of pace for the Barbadian hitmaker . As much as we love Rihanna ’ s dance club hits , it ’ s refreshing to hear a song built around her impressive voice . " Stacey Anderson of Spin magazine explained the lyrical meaning behind the song , saying , " ' California King Bed ' is a wrenching ballad about the waking death of a relationship , the stage of limbo before the final crash ; it 's so well @-@ delivered , in fact , that it 's hard to hear . " Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars , saying " The fourth single proper from Loud may pull in the reins as far as the hectic dance beats and sado @-@ masochistic lyrics go , but it 's no less beefy and extravagant .

She belts out in a range well beyond her natural vocal ability . " Thomas Conner of Chicago Sun @-@ Times concluded that " The acoustic strums of ' California King Bed ' build to a cinematic , Diane Warren @-@ sized breakup chorus . " 
 Entertainment Weekly 's Kyle Anderson gave a mixed review of the song saying : " she [ Rihanna ] doesn 't have the chops to be a balladeer , which made the torch @-@ song quality of ' California King Bed ' land with a thud . " Similarly , Henry Goldblatt of the same publication graded the song with a B + and gave a critical review of the title saying that it was borrowed from Pottery Barn . However , Goldblatt praised the irresistible heartbreak in the song and added that Rihanna 's voice demonstrates more range and power than her older material . Andy Kellman of Allmusic and Emily Mackay of NME were more critical of the song in their review , with the former calling the song an " overwrought rock weeper " and the latter saying it is a " howler of a ballad , with <unk> acoustic intro , trite piano and a faux @-@ Slash solo .

" The writer finished the review saying that " Not much happens in the video – but then , that 's the point .

 = Typhoon Nelson ( 1982 ) = 
 Typhoon Nelson , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Bising , was the second tropical cyclone to strike the Philippines within a week in March 1982 . Nelson originated from a tropical disturbance southeast of Guam towards the middle of March . Although the system was initially poorly organized , it developed rather quickly , and was upgraded into Tropical Storm Nelson on March 19 . It tracked westward , and fluctuated in intensity for several days . On March 24 , Typhoon Nelson intensified into a typhoon , and entered an episode of rapid intensification . On March 25 , Nelson reached its peak intensity of 115 km / h ( 70 mph ) , but thereafter moved ashore on the Philippines , where the storm weakened significantly . On March 27 , the typhoon entered the South China Sea , and the next day , briefly re @-@ intensified before resuming a weakening trend . Nelson dissipated on March 31 . Affecting the nation less than a week after Tropical Storm Mamie did , Nelson was responsible for additional flooding across much of the Philippines . Fifty @-@ six people were killed due to the typhoon , eight of whom perished due to drownings . Over 1 @,@ 200 homes were destroyed . More than 165 @,@ 000 people fled to shelters , including 83 @,@ 000 that were displaced from their home . Thirty fishing boats and 23 ferries were destroyed due to the system . Damage amounted to $ 17 @.@ 2 million ( 1982 USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The second of three early season tropical cyclones to form in the West Pacific basin , Typhoon Nelson can be traced back to a low latitude area of disturbed in mid @-@ March . The Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) started watching the system at 0000 UTC on March 18 while a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) was issued . Initially , the system was disorganized , but the disturbance was located in a favorable environment aloft and began to develop rapidly . Ten hours after the TCFA , the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression . Early on March 19 , the JMA classified the system as a tropical storm . Later that morning , Hurricane Hunters reported winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) and a barometric pressure of 993 mbar ( 29 @.@ 3 inHg ) . Based on this , the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Storm Nelson . 
 Nelson tracked westward , staying south of a large subtropical ridge . Despite the aforementioned favorable environment , Nelson briefly weakened late on March 19 , but re @-@ intensified slightly the following morning . Shortly thereafter , the JTWC upgraded the system into a typhoon . Further intensification was halted due to increased easterly wind shear , and the storm began to level off in intensity as it accelerated on a westward course . On March 21 , the JMA declared Nelson a severe tropical storm . According to the JTWC , the storm fluctuated between tropical storm and typhoon status for about 60 hours , even though the JMA suggest that Nelson did not become a typhoon until March 24 . Around this time , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) also started monitoring the storm , assigning it with the local name Bising . 
 After becoming a typhoon , Nelson forward 's speed began to slow down as the storm began to move away from the ridge and encounter more conducive conditions . Consequently , Typhoon Nelson began to deepen more rapidly , and by the afternoon of March 25 , both the JTWC and JMA increased the intensity to 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . Although the JMA suggests the system reached its peak intensity at that time , the JTWC indicated that Nelson strengthen slightly on March 25 , and attained winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) , equivalent to a major hurricane or a Category 3 system on the United States @-@ based Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale . Shortly thereafter , the storm moved ashore in the Philippine at peak intensity . After making landfall , Nelson weakened over the south @-@ central portion of the nation . By March 26 , the JMA had lowered the winds to 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) . 
 By March 27 , Nelson re @-@ emerged into the South China Sea , having weakened considerably , and data from both the JMA and JTWC indicated that Nelson was no longer a typhoon . The next day , Nelson briefly re @-@ intensified slightly , and at 1800 UTC on March 28 , the JMA estimated a secondary peak intensity of 105 km / h ( 65 mph ) . On the following day , Nelson resumed weakening due to increased wind shear . Despite the presence of a trough , Nelson did not recurve northeast , and instead meandered westward . On the afternoon of March 31 , the JMA ceased watching Nelson . On the next day , the JTWC followed suit while located about 450 km ( 280 mi ) east of Nha Trang , Vietnam .

 Typhoon Nelson was the second storm to strike the Philippines within a week , following Tropical Storm Mamie , which claimed 54 lives . Considered a " pre @-@ season " storm by newspapers , Nelson required storm warnings for parts of the nation , which were broadcast via radio . Much of the southern section of the Philippines were placed on typhoon alert . Due to the threat of storm surge , residents in coastal areas were advised to evacuate to higher ground . 
 Typhoon Nelson was responsible for significant flooding across the Philippines . On the offshore Leyte Island , a radio transmitter and a school were destroyed . In Cebu City , schools , businesses , and government offices were closed for a day . Across the low @-@ lying town of <unk> , flooding occurred . A total of 1 @,@ 261 dwellings were leveled , including 703 houses destroyed in the provinces of Cebu , Bohol , and Surigao , leaving approximately 83 @,@ 000 people homeless . In Loreto Town , part of the <unk> Province , 95 % of all coconut trees were toppled , and all but 45 of the town 's 600 houses were demolished . A total of 165 @,@ 462 persons evacuated to shelters . Widespread power outages occurred while many bridges were washed away .

 = Hopeville Pond State Park = 
 Hopeville Pond State Park is a Connecticut state park located in the town of Griswold . Before European colonization , the Mohegan people constructed weirs and fished from the Pachaug River . In 1711 , Stephen Gates was granted 14 acres of land that now resides within the park 's limits and constructed a gristmill and sawmill at the natural falls . In 1818 , <unk> Abel purchased the mill privilege and built a woolen mill at the site . The mills were later acquired by John Slater who constructed a <unk> mill and named it " Hope Mill " . The village of Hopeville would derive its name from the mill , and it thrived until a series of fires destroyed the mills , the church and some houses . Sometime before 1917 , the Ashland Cotton Company erected a dam on the site and created a 145 @-@ acre reservoir . The United States Government purchased the land in the 1930s for recreational use and used the Civilian Conservation Corps to adapt the land to the purpose . In 1938 , the State of Connecticut designated Hopeville Pond as a state park . 
 Hopeville Pond State Park 's recreational activities include biking , hiking , camping , fishing , boating and swimming . A variety of fish are found in the park , including northern pike , largemouth bass , and yellow perch . The park has a total of 80 camp sites with each site featuring a fire ring with grate and a picnic table . The park manager 's house is a National Register of Historic Places listed property . 
 = = History = = 
 Hopeville Pond was by the Mohegan Indians for fishing prior to the European colonization . The Mohegans built weirs to direct the water flow and fish to the center of the stream for easy capture in fishing baskets . In 1711 , Stephen Gates was granted 14 acres of land which lies within the state park limits . Gates constructed a gristmill and sawmill at the natural falls along the Pachaug River . In 1818 , <unk> Abel purchased the mill privilege and built a woolen mill at the site . Later , John Slater purchased the three mills and constructed a <unk> mill and named it " Hope Mill " . The village of Hopeville derived its name from the mill and would also carry it through to the Hopeville Pond and the Hopeville Pond State Park name . The natural falls of the mill sites are no longer visible as they are now underwater . 
 By 1840 , Hopeville was a " thriving village " according to Daniel L. Phillips , author of Griswold - a history . On November 4 , 1850 , a meeting was held to discuss the construction of a house of worship . A church was erected for $ 1 @,@ 700 and dedicated on December 12 , 1852 . The village of Hopeville reached its peak in 1860 and was well known for its production of <unk> . In 1881 , the mill , then owned by Edwin <unk> and Company , was destroyed in a fire and not rebuilt . The Ashland Cotton Company would later acquire the property . In 1900 , the church and four houses also burned . In 1908 , the original gristmill from 1711 was also destroyed by fire . Sometime before 1917 , the Ashland Cotton Company erected a dam on the site and created the 145 acre reservoir ; the dam was used to generate electrical power for its mills in Jewett City . The United States Government purchased the land in the 1930s for recreational use and used the Civilian Conservation Corps to adapt the land to the purpose , including the construction of fire control ponds , forest roads and adapting the Avery House for park use . In 1938 , the State of Connecticut designated Hopeville Pond as a state park .

 And Yet It Moves is a platform video game developed by independent developer Broken Rules . The game was released for Microsoft Windows , Mac OS X , and Linux on April 2 , 2009 , and a Wii port was released on the Wii Shop Channel in August 2010 . And Yet It Moves was originally designed as a computer science project at the Vienna University of Technology in 2007 . When the original prototype won or was nominated for awards at various independent game festivals , the team decided to create a full version of the game . 
 And Yet It Moves focuses on moving the player character through a series of hazardous environments . The player possesses the ability to freely rotate the entire game world , transforming walls into floors and vice versa . The game 's levels and puzzles are designed around this concept . The game features paper collage styled visuals designed by Jan Hackl and a beatboxing soundtrack performed by Christoph Binder . 
 Both the PC and WiiWare versions of the game received positive reviews , with many critics applauding the gameplay mechanics and the visuals . And Yet It Moves was also released as part of the third Humble Indie Bundle . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 And Yet It Moves is a single @-@ player puzzle platform game set in a world stylized to resemble a paper collage , where background elements and characters consist of ripped paper . The nameless player character , who appears as a cutout pencil line @-@ drawing on white paper , is moved through a series of levels by running and jumping across the obstacles and avoiding hazards . The player possesses the ability to " spin " the entire game world in 90 or 180 degree increments at any time . Because the rotation is instantaneous and gravity will always point " downward " relative to the game screen , spinning the world has physical consequences on the player character and on the environment : walls that are too steep to climb become flat , walkable surfaces , and objects may move or react to the change in gravity . All objects retain their momentum relative to their frame of reference . 
 The levels in And Yet It Moves are designed such that spinning the world at certain moments is required to progress . Because the character will tear into pieces if he falls from too high a distance , the player must often spin the world such that the character can safely surmount or descend from large obstacles . Other hazards such as wild beasts , fire and boulders , or falling into the black void that borders the playing field will tear the character . However , the player has unlimited lives and will reappear at the last checkpoint he passed prior to being torn . 
 The main campaign mode offers 17 levels that span three different environments . There are other gameplay features available , such as online leaderboards , various time attack modes , and optional achievements that are awarded for performing specific objectives . 
 In the Wii version , players control the game using the Wii Remote held sideways , and the game world is rotated by twisting the controller in various directions . The Nunchuk and Classic Controller are also compatible for alternate control schemes . This version also removes the restriction to only rotate in 90 degree intervals and offers three additional levels compared to the PC versions . 
 = = Development = = 
 And Yet It Moves is the first video game developed by Broken Rules , an independent game developer based in Vienna . The game began as a bachelor project held by the Department for Design and Assessment of Technology at the Vienna University of Technology . The four computer science students involved wanted to design a game that gave the player more freedom than possible in normal 2D games ; a side @-@ scrolling platform game with the ability to rotate the entire game world was chosen . A prototype of the game took half a year to develop using the Torque game engine , and the name And Yet It Moves was chosen for its ambiguity and " it hints at world rotation , " an allusion to Galileo Galilei 's famous ( but apocryphal ) remark " Eppur si muove " . The prototype was showcased at various independent game development festivals and garnered positive feedback ; it was a winner in the Student Showcase category of the 2007 Independent Games Festival and a nominee for the 2007 <unk> Top Talent Award . The interest in the title inspired the students to develop a full game , which took approximately two years . Broken Rules was founded when it was realized that " it was a necessity [ in order ] to better deal with all the organizational , financial and juridical hassles that are involved when making business . " 
 Broken Rules did not have a dedicated artist , so the designers chose a graphical style they believed was both aesthetically pleasing and easy to create . A pencil @-@ on @-@ paper look was first attempted , but it appeared " empty and boring " until photographs , collected from public sources such as <unk> , were added . The style evolved into the game 's final ripped paper collage look , intended to appear " rough and analog . " Designer Christoph Binder created the game 's background music and sound effects by beatboxing , echoing this motif . Felix Bohatsch , the project lead , stated in an interview that adding a narrative or backstory was avoided in favor of prioritizing the gameplay . He added however that the level design follows a leitmotif that conveys " a journey from being confined to becoming free " as the game progresses , first beginning in dark caves and ending in a wide blank space . 
 In October 2008 , Nintendo contacted Broken Rules and asked if a downloadable WiiWare version of And Yet It Moves could be developed for its Wii console after seeing a demonstration of the game at the 2008 IndieCade Festival in Los Angeles . Bohatsch stated that " we didn 't think long about this decision because we always wanted to bring And Yet It Moves to a console and I have a sweet spot for the Wii . " However , the PC game 's projected release date was April 2 , 2009 ; it was too late in development to begin co @-@ developing for Wii and launch simultaneously on both platforms . PC version development was completed first and then Wii development started in June . 
 Because And Yet It Moves was originally designed to be played with digital controls , the Wii Remote 's analog motion controls needed to be implemented such that they felt natural and not intrusive . Broken Rules determined , following a number of tests , that allowing the player to freely rotate to any degree best suited motion controls ; originally the player could only rotate in 90 degree intervals . Four different control schemes were implemented to satisfy a wide number of players , three of which either use motion control or the Wii Remote pointer . While the file size limit imposed on WiiWare games was not an issue , the visuals needed to be <unk> to cohere with the Wii hardware . A standard @-@ definition television was used in development ; Bohatsch felt the visuals looked nicer on the <unk> than on a PC or Mac with higher display resolution , but warned that some HDTVs might not <unk> the Wii resolution properly , recommending that a component cable be used while playing the game . The online leaderboards were omitted from the Wii version because the PC version 's leaderboards were not frequently used . Three new levels , unlocked when the player completes the main campaign mode , were added . The near final version of the game was submitted to Nintendo 's Quality Assurance team in May 2010 to inspect and find bugs . And Yet It Moves was released on the Wii Shop Channel in North America on August 23 , 2010 and then in Europe on August 27 . 
 Broken Rules currently has no plans to develop a sequel to And Yet It Moves , due to the time spent on the game . Bohatsch commented that he is unopposed to the idea and is amenable to proposals to develop such a game . 
 = = Reception = = 
 And Yet It Moves received generally favorable reviews . The PC version gained aggregate scores of 71 @.@ 50 % and 75 on GameRankings and Metacritic , respectively , while the WiiWare version gained aggregate scores of 85 @.@ 30 % and 83 . Critics applauded the game 's unique take on the platforming genre and the game 's paper collage visual style , but felt the game was too short . Some critics noted the absence of any narrative or backstory , but felt that the game ultimately didn 't need one , though GameSpot noted it as one of the game 's weaknesses . 
 In his review of the PC version , IGN 's Daemon Hatfield stated that And Yet It Moves " manages to make this quarter @-@ century old genre [ 2D platformer ] feel new again . " Hatfield praised the gameplay , which was " challenging but avoids being frustrating " , but felt there wasn 't enough content to warrant the $ 15 price , despite the additional game modes available . Hatfield scored the game 8 @.@ 4 out of 10 . GameFocus scored the PC version 8 @.@ 0 out of 10 , praising the gameplay , sound , controls , and use of physics . The review also stated that players are unlikely to experience motion sickness despite the frequent rotating of the game screen . GameSpot scored the PC version 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 , stating that while the rotation mechanic " wears thin toward the end of the game , " " the increasingly exotic level design manages to keep the good times rolling until the end . " 
 Justin Haywald of 1UP.com stated that " even when I felt I had to guess which direction I was supposed to go , the levels are set up well enough that the way forward is always easy to figure out " . Haywald praised the visuals as well , but stated that " as the scenery grows more cluttered , it also sometimes becomes difficult to find a safe place to land after sending the world spinning " . Haywald rated And Yet It Moves a B + . NintendoLife rated the WiiWare version 9 out of 10 , stating that the new additions and updated controls made it the " definitive version of the game " despite the omission of online features seen in the PC version . 
 = = = Sales = = = 
 Felix Bohatsch of Broken Rules reported in May 2009 that sales of the PC version were " not at a level we were expecting " . No digital rights management ( DRM ) protection was placed on the game because " we ... believe that any game will be cracked , no matter how we try to protect it , so our philosophy is that adding DRM or anything similar only annoys the people who actually pay for it . " The bootlegging rate was approximately 95 @.@ 5 % , meaning " for every game [ sold ] there are 22 cracked version [ sic ] being played " . Bohatsch speculated that the poor sales were partly caused by the levels demonstrated in the free game demo , which did not focus enough on the game 's puzzles . More than 370 @,@ 000 units of the game were sold as part of the third Humble Indie Bundle . 
 = Sängerfest = 
 Sängerfest , also Sängerbund @-@ Fest , <unk> , or <unk> , meaning singer festival , is a competition of <unk> , or singer groups , with prizes for the best group or groups . Such public events are also known as a <unk> , or song festival . Participants number in the hundreds and thousands , and the fest is usually accompanied by a parade and other celebratory events . The sängerfest is most associated with the Germanic culture . Its origins can be traced back to 19th century Europe . Swiss composer Hans Georg Nägeli and educator Carl August Zeller , both protégés of Swiss educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi , established sängerbunds to help foster social change throughout Germany and Prussia . University students began to choose the art form as an avenue for political statements . As the sängerfest concept gained popularity and spread around the world , it was adapted by Christian churches for spiritual worship services . European immigrants brought the tradition in a non @-@ political form to the North American continent . In the early part of the 20th century , sängerfest celebrations drew devotees in the tens of thousands , and included some United States presidents among their audiences . <unk> are still active in Europe and in American communities with Germanic heritage .

 Students of Swiss educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi , a proponent of social reform , applied his teachings when founding some singing groups as an instrument for cultural change . One of his students was Carl August Zeller , who helped establish the <unk> movement throughout Prussia in 1809 . Pestalozzi 's protégé Hans Georg Nägeli was a composer , music teacher and songbook publisher who made numerous journeys across Germany from 1819 to encourage the formation of male singing groups for social reform . Nägeli established several sängerbunds in Switzerland , which became the inspiration for the 1824 establishment of the Stuttgarter Liederkranz . Following the 1819 Carlsbad Decrees in Germany , male @-@ only choral celebrations with hundreds or thousands of vocalists were popular with the masses and often part of political events . 
 Composer Friedrich <unk> was directly influenced by Pestalozzi and Nägeli . He began using large choirs to express political viewpoints at least as early as 1824 when he and a group of Tübingen University students performed La Marseillaise to commemorate the storming of the Bastille . In 1827 at <unk> , Baden @-@ Württemberg , several male @-@ voiced choirs combined for a regional <unk> . <unk> were part of the Hambach Festival of 1832 . 
 Christian church organizations known as <unk> sängerbunds adapted the sängerfest for religious gatherings and helped spread its popularity throughout Europe , North America and Australia . They became popular in late 19th century Russia among Mennonite congregations . On 30 May 1893 , a sängerfest of seven choirs was held in <unk> in <unk> , Ukraine . On Sunday , 29 May 1894 , the all @-@ day <unk> <unk> was held in <unk> under the direction of Polish conductor Friedrich <unk> with assistance from Aron Gerhard <unk> , director of the <unk> Mennonite Brethren Church . Beginning on 3 May , Schweiger traveled across Russia rehearsing choirs . On 29 May there were breakfasts for attendees , an estimated 50 vocal presentations by individual choirs , prayer services and sermons , lunch for 2 @,@ 000 people and afternoon snacks .

 Mennonites established the northwest Philadelphia section of Germantown in 1683 . The Philadelphia Männerchor founded by German immigrant Phillip Matthias <unk> in 1835 was the first German @-@ American singing society organized in the United States where the sängerfest began to evolve as a form of civic entertainment . In 1836 , <unk> founded the Baltimore Liederkranz , which became the first to accept women members ( 1838 ) . In 1846 , the Philadelphia , Pennsylvania group and the Baltimore , Maryland group performed together at a public sängerfest . The " Brooklyn Daily Eagle Almanac " of 1891 listed numerous sängerbunds in the Brooklyn , New York area . On 21 June 1901 , the Nord @-@ Amerikanischer Sängerbund presented a sängerfest in Buffalo , New York at the famous Pan @-@ American Exposition ( where 25th President William McKinley was shot by Leon Czolgosz in a reception line in September 1901 ) . A group in Buffalo hoped to help pay the expenses of the fest by forming the Buffalo Sängerfest Company , selling 1 @,@ 600 shares of stock at $ 25 each . 
 In 1838 , the Cincinnati <unk> Gesangverein was formed in Ohio , followed by the Cincinnati Deutsch Liedertafel in 1844 . The Gesang und <unk> Deutscher Arbeiter formed in 1846 and was the first Cincinnati group that allowed women . Groups from Ohio , Kentucky , Maryland and Indiana created the Nord @-@ Amerikanischer Sängerbund in 1849 for a sängerfest hosted by Cincinnati , featuring the music of German composers . By 1908 , it was estimated that 250 @,@ 000 German Americans belonged to musical organizations , and 50 @,@ 000 of those belonged to the Nord @-@ Amerikanischer Sängerbund . The first post @-@ Civil War sängerfest in Columbus , Ohio took place 29 August – 1 September 1865 at Schreiner 's Hall and the Opera House . Each arriving <unk> was escorted to the hall by the Eighteenth regiment of the United States Infantry . There were an estimated 400 singers entertaining 12 @,@ 000 to 15 @,@ 000 attendees . The closing day was celebrated with pomp and circumstance . 
 The first sängerfest in Texas was held in 1853 in New Braunfels , and was held annually until 1860 when conflicting loyalties about , and participation in , the American Civil War caused a 10 @-@ year gap in the events . The San Antonio Männergesang @-@ Verein was formed in 1847 , the New Braunfels Gesangverein Germania formed in 1850 , and the Austin Männerchor formed in 1852 . On 4 July 1853 in San Antonio , the San Antonio Männergesang @-@ Verein sponsored an Independence Day celebration attended by the New Braunfels Gesangverein and the Austin Männerchor . The New Braunfels Gesangverein invited everyone to meet in New Braunfels on 16 – 17 October 1853 for its first Texas Sängerfest . In 1854 , the aggregate sängerbunds formed the Texas State Sängerbund . The San Antonio Beethoven Männerchor was organized in 1867 by Wilhelm <unk> , assistant conductor of the San Antonio Männergesang @-@ Verein . After the surrender of the Confederacy in 1865 , <unk> raised the Union flag of the " Stars and Stripes " over the historic Texan battle site and former church mission , the Alamo in San Antonio and distributed wine and songbooks . The all @-@ male Houston Sängerbund was founded on 6 October 1883 and chartered in 1890 . It affiliated itself with Der Deutsch @-@ <unk> Sängerbund . In 1887 , founding member Carl C.

 = Tom Norman = 
 Tom Norman , born Thomas Noakes , ( 7 May 1860 – 24 August 1930 ) , was an English businessman , showman and the last exhibitor of Joseph Merrick who was otherwise known as the " Elephant Man " . Among his later exhibits were a troupe of midgets , a " Man in a Trance " , " John Chambers the armless Carpenter " , and the " World 's Ugliest Woman " . 
 Norman started his working life as a butcher in Sussex before moving to London at the age of 14 where he sought a career on the music hall stage . There , he became interested in freak shows which he attended in his spare time . After viewing an exhibition called " Electric Lady " next door to his place of work , he went into business with the exhibition 's manager and began his career as a showman of human oddities . He quickly became successful , for his patter as much as his exhibits , and was called the ' Silver King ' by the American showman P. T. Barnum . 
 In 1884 , Norman took over the management of Joseph Merrick , otherwise known as the " Elephant Man " , and exhibited him for a few weeks until police closed down the show . Merrick later went to live at the London Hospital under the care of Sir Frederick Treves . In his 1923 memoirs , Treves portrayed Norman as a cruel drunk who ruthlessly exploited his acts . Norman refuted this characterisation and said that he provided Merrick ( and his other " freaks " ) with a means of making money independently . Norman continued a successful career as a showman and later became an auctioneer of novelty shows and circuses . 
 Norman died in 1930 and was survived by his wife and 10 children , five of whom followed him into the entertainment business . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Norman was born Thomas Noakes on 7 May 1860 in Dallington , Sussex . He was the eldest of 17 children to Thomas Noakes , a butcher and a farmer , and his wife Eliza ( née <unk> ) . 
 Norman was introduced to his father 's trade at an early age and left school to work with him when he was 12 . He decided to go travelling two years later to seek a career as a performer . He was unsuccessful and after a short while , he moved to London where he worked as a butcher 's assistant . A <unk> gambler , Norman moved to Berkshire where he took up professional gambling at Ascot Racecourse . He wound up penniless and resumed his butchery trade in London where he gained a new interest in freak show entertainment . 
 = = = Novelties = = = 
 After his unsuccessful venture in Berkshire , Norman returned to being a butcher , and , one day , viewed the " novelties " at a penny gaff next to his place of employment in Islington . There , Mlle Electra , " The Only Electric Lady — A Lady Born Full of Electricity " gave audience members an electrical shock via her handshake . Norman was impressed with the exhibition , realised its lucrative potential , and left his job to enter into business with Mlle Electra 's manager . He quickly discovered Electra was a fake connected to a supply of electricity . 
 When Mlle Electra was exhibited at Kingston Fair , Norman realised he would be better off working alone , and successfully staged his own " Electric Lady " in Hammersmith . He learned that his skills as an entertainer were as important to his success as the novelties he exhibited . At some point , he changed his birth name to Tom Norman , and renounced his inheritance . According to Joseph Merrick 's biographers Michael Howell and Peter Ford , Norman may have changed his name to avoid shaming his family by his " distasteful " connections to circuses and fairgrounds . 
 Over the next few years , Norman 's travelling exhibitions featured Eliza Jenkins , the " Skeleton Woman " , a " Balloon Headed Baby " and a woman who bit off the heads of live rats — the " most gruesome " act Norman claimed to have seen . Other acts included fleas , fat ladies , giants , dwarves and retired white seamen , painted black and speaking in an invented language , billed " savage Zulus " . He displayed a " family of midgets " which in reality was composed of two men and a borrowed baby . He operated a number of shops in London and Nottingham , and exhibited travelling shows throughout the country . In 1882 , Norman gave a show at Islington 's Royal Agricultural Hall . Unknown to Norman , the show was attended by American showman P. T. Barnum . Norman falsely claimed to his audience , as he had often done in the past , that his show had been booked to appear at Barnum 's ' Greatest Show on Earth ' . Barnum was much amused and afterwards , seeing Norman 's silver necklace and noting his gift for oratory , dubbed him the ' Silver King ' . With 13 shops in London alone , Norman ran into a shortage of curiosities and travelled the country looking for new acts . He enticed human novelties into his employ with promises of generous salaries . 
 = = = Elephant Man = = = 
 In 1884 , Norman came into contact with Joseph Merrick , a young man from Leicester who had extreme deformities . Unable to find work due to his physical appearance , Merrick ended up in the Leicester workhouse for four years . In 1884 he left the workhouse and put himself in the charge of the music hall proprietors Sam Torr and J. Ellis , and the travelling showman ' Little George ' Hitchcock . Collectively , they presented Merrick as " The Elephant Man , Half @-@ a @-@ Man and Half @-@ an @-@ Elephant " . They quickly realised that they would not be able to show Merrick for too long in one place , for fear of the novelty wearing off , and towards the end of 1884 , Hitchcock contacted Norman , an acquaintance of his , and transferred management of the Elephant Man to him . 
 Merrick arrived in London and into Norman 's care . Norman , initially shocked by Merrick 's appearance and reluctant to display him , nonetheless exhibited him at his penny gaff shop at 123 Whitechapel Road , directly across the road from the London Hospital . Because of its proximity to the hospital , the shop received medical students and doctors as visitors . One of these was the surgeon Frederick Treves who arranged to have Merrick brought into the hospital to be examined . According to Norman 's autobiography , Merrick went to the hospital " two or three " times , but then refused to go any more , as the examinations made him feel " like an animal in a cattle market " . 
 The exhibition of the Elephant Man was reasonably successful , particularly with the added income from a printed pamphlet about Merrick 's life and condition . At this time , however , public opinion about freak shows was starting to change and the display of human novelties was beginning to be viewed as distasteful . After only a few weeks with Norman , the Elephant Man exhibition was shut down by the police , and Norman and Merrick parted ways . Treves later arranged for Merrick to live at the London Hospital until Merrick 's death in 1890 . In Treves 's 1923 memoir , The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences Norman was portrayed as a drunk who cruelly exploited Merrick . Norman counteracted these claims in a letter in the World 's Fair newspaper that year , as well as his own autobiography . Norman 's opinion was that he provided Merrick ( and his other exhibits ) a way of making a living and remaining independent , but that on entering the London Hospital , Merrick remained a freak on display , only with no control over how or when he was viewed . The character Bytes , respectively portrayed by Freddie Jones in the 1980 film The Elephant Man , is based on Norman . 
 = = = Later life = = = 
 Norman remained a travelling showman for another 10 years following his encounter with Joseph Merrick , and exhibited , among others , a troupe of midgets , a ' Man in a Trance ' , John Chambers the armless Carpenter and the ' World 's Ugliest Woman ' . In 1893 , he announced that he was leaving for Chicago and advertised his goods for sale , but in the end , he never went . He became involved with the temperance movement and was the vice @-@ president of the Van Dwellers Protection Association ( which later became the Showmen 's Guild of Great Britain ) . He became a showman 's auctioneer , auctioning novelty shows and circuses and according to the World 's Fair , presided over more such sales than any other auctioneer in the country at that time . Norman married the theatre performer Amy Rayner in 1896 , and they had six sons and four daughters . The family moved to Croydon , and Norman went into semi @-@ retirement , selling off some of his shops . In 1905 he sold showman " Lord " George Sanger 's zoo , and then all of Sanger 's circus effects , an achievement Norman called " the crowning point in my life as regards the <unk> business " . He made his comeback in 1919 with the exhibition of ' Phoebe the Strange Girl ' in Birmingham and Margate .

 Norman died of throat cancer on 24 August 1930 at Croydon Hospital , aged 70 .

 = Banksia sphaerocarpa = 
 Banksia sphaerocarpa , commonly known as the Fox Banksia or Round @-@ fruit Banksia , is a species of shrub or tree in the plant genus Banksia ( family Proteaceae ) . It is generally encountered as a 1 – 2 m ( 3 @.@ 3 – 6 @.@ 6 ft ) high shrub , and is usually smaller in the north of its range . This species has narrow green leaves , and brownish , orange or yellow round flower spikes which may be seen from January to July . It is widely distributed across the southwest of Western Australia , growing exclusively in sandy soils . It is usually the dominant plant in scrubland or low woodland . It is pollinated by , and is a food source for , birds , mammals , and insects . 
 First described in 1810 by botanist Robert Brown , B. sphaerocarpa has a complicated taxonomic history , and several taxa once classified as part of a broadly defined B. sphaerocarpa have since been named as species in their own right . At present , most authorities recognise five varieties ; the largest variety , B. sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla ( Ironcap Banksia ) , is sometimes given species rank as B. dolichostyla . B. sphaerocarpa is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia , although two varieties have been placed on the Declared Rare and Priority Flora List — var. latifolia has been declared a Priority Two – Poorly Known taxon , and var. dolichostyla has been Declared Rare Flora . None of the varieties are commonly seen in cultivation . 
 = = Description = = 
 Banksia sphaerocarpa is a variable species that differs in plant size , flower size and leaf size across its range . The variability is marked enough that five varieties are recognised . This species is generally a shrub 0 @.@ 4 – 2 m ( 1 @.@ 3 – 6 @.@ 6 ft ) tall . Plants are smaller in northern parts of the range , and grow larger in the southeast , with var. dolichostyla and rarely var. caesia reaching 4 m ( 13 ft ) in height . All varieties bear a lignotuber , a swollen starchy root crown from which the plant resprouts after bushfire . The new stems are finely hairy but become smooth with maturity . The leaves are stiff , narrow and linear , and measure 2 @.@ 5 – 10 cm ( 0 @.@ 98 – 3 @.@ 94 in ) in length , on a petiole 2 – 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 079 – 0 @.@ 118 in ) long . Leaves of most varieties are 1 – 1 @.@ 5 mm in width , and have a pointed tip , but var. latifolia has wider leaves , 2 – 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 – 0 @.@ 98 in ) , and a blunter tip . The foliage is green , or a more pale blue @-@ grey in the case of caesia and dolichostyla . 
 The inflorescences are generally globular and measure 5 to 8 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 to 3 @.@ 1 in ) in diameter , although larger forms , such as var. dolichostyla , are more oval in shape . Flowering from January to July , the blooms are yellow , orange or brownish in colour . They take five to eight weeks to develop from bud to the finish of flowering . Anthesis takes place over two weeks , as the individual flowers open in a wave across the inflorescence . Three weeks before the flowers open , the spikes develop a strong musky smell . The flowers produce unusually large quantities of nectar ; indeed some flowers produce so much that it drips to the ground . The old flowers fade to brownish and grey hues and remain curled around the flower spike . Up to 60 follicles develop on the globular spikes . The follicles are finely furred at first before becoming smooth and golden brown in colour , measuring 1 @.@ 5 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 59 – 1 @.@ 18 in ) long , 0 @.@ 5 – 0 @.@ 8 cm ( 0 @.@ 20 – 0 @.@ 31 in ) high , and 1 – 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 39 – 0 @.@ 98 in ) wide . The follicles are flat with pronounced ' shoulders ' , giving a rectangular appearance in cross section . Specimens of var. sphaerocarpa in the Whicher Range , Jarrah Forest and the vicinity of <unk> have larger follicles . The seeds are wedge @-@ shaped ( cuneate ) , and measure 2 @.@ 0 – 2 @.@ 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 – 1 @.@ 02 in ) in length , containing a smaller cuneate seed body measuring 1 – 1 @.@ 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 39 – 0 @.@ 55 in ) long by 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 20 – 0 @.@ 51 in ) wide . 
 Northern specimens can be quite small shrubs and may be hard to distinguish from B. micrantha , which has smaller inflorescences and large flattened follicles . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The earliest known botanical collection of B. sphaerocarpa occurred in December 1801 , during the visit of HMS Investigator to King George Sound . The specimen was collected from " A single plant observed between Princess Royal Harbour & Oyster Harbour on a heath " , and is credited to English botanist Robert Brown , though it is not possible to be certain on this point , as Brown incorporated the collections of junior expedition members into his herbarium without attribution . Neither Brown nor expedition horticulturist Peter Good mentions the collection in his diary . 
 Brown published a formal description and name for the species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu . He did not designate a type specimen ( a specimen to be representative of the species ) for the species , but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species . He also did not state the etymology of the specific epithet , but it is accepted that the name derives from the Ancient Greek <unk> ( " round " ) , and <unk> ( " fruit " ) , in reference to the shape of its infructescences . 
 In Brown 's arrangement of the genus , B. sphaerocarpa was placed between B. pulchella and B. nutans in taxonomic sequence ; that is , an order that places related taxa next to each other . No subdivision of the genus was given , other than to separate a single distinctive species into a subgenus of its own . Swiss botanist Carl Meissner published a more detailed arrangement in 1856 , placing B. sphaerocarpa in section Eubanksia because its inflorescence is a spike rather than a domed head , and in series Abietinae , whose members have inrolled leaf margins with no , or only very fine , serrations . Meissner also published a variety , B. sphaerocarpa var. glabrescens , based on specimens collected by James Drummond ; this is now considered a synonym of B. incana . 
 George Bentham 's revision of Banksia for his 1870 Flora Australiensis overturned Meissner 's series ; instead , B. sphaerocarpa was placed in a new section , Oncostylis , because of its hooked styles . Two varieties were recognised : Meissner 's var. glabrescens was retained , and var. latifolia was newly described by Bentham . Bentham noted further variation amongst his specimens not accounted for by his varieties , stating " It is possible therefore that two species may be here confounded , but the specimens are insufficient for their distinction . " 
 For many years following Bentham 's arrangement , the circumscription of B. sphaerocarpa was widely recognised as unacceptably broad . William Blackall informally published two varieties , var. pinifolia and var. violacea ( properly Banksia violacea ) in his 1954 How to Know Western Australian Wildflowers ; and in 1966 the nurseryman Fred Lullfitz predicted that there were as many as eight taxa within the species . Several of these were recognised in George 's revision of the genus for 1981 " The genus Banksia L.f. ( Proteaceae ) " : B. micrantha , B. grossa , B. lanata , B. scabrella , B. telmatiaea , B. leptophylla and B. incana . George placed B. sphaerocarpa in subgenus Banksia because of its flower spike , section Oncostylis because its styles are hooked , and the resurrected series Abietinae , which he constrained to contain only round @-@ fruited species . He reduced variety latifolia to synonymy with variety sphaerocarpa , but conceded the species needed further review . Alex George reported that he thought Banksia sphaerocarpa 's closest relatives to be Banksia micrantha and B. grossa . 
 George 's arrangement remained current until 1996 , when Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published an arrangement informed by a cladistic analysis of morphological characteristics . They retained George 's subgenera and many of his series , but discarded his sections . Banksia ser . Abietinae was found to be very nearly monophyletic , and so retained . It further resolved into four subclades , so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four subseries . Banksia sphaerocarpa appeared in the second of these , initially called the ' grossa clade ' for its most basal member . As with George 's classification , B. grossa and B. micrantha emerged as close relatives of B. sphaerocarpa . 
 This clade became the basis for new subseries <unk> , which Thiele defined as containing those species with lignotubers , styles loosely curling around the infructescence ( although this trait was reversed in micrantha ) , and " transversely aligned cells of the seed wing inner face " . Other than the most basal B. grossa , these species also have shouldered follicles . Having found B. micrantha to be more closely related than B. sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla to the other varieties of B. sphaerocarpa , they promoted var. dolichostyla to species rank as Banksia dolichostyla . Morphological support for this was given by the fact that the old styles of var. dolichostyla are quite different from those of other varieties , being stouter , and tending not to curl around the infructescence as the others do . 
 Questioning the emphasis on cladistics in Thiele and Ladiges ' arrangement , George published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of Banksia for the Flora of Australia series of monographs . He added that he did not feel the characters of dolichostyla alone justified specific rank , beings essentially merely larger in all parts than , but otherwise essentially similar to , var. caesia . Therefore , he retained it as a variety of B. sphaerocarpa . To date , George 's 1999 arrangement remains the most recent comprehensive classification . The placement of B. sphaerocarpa in George 's 1999 arrangement may be summarised as follows : 
 Banksia 
 B. subg . Banksia 
 B. sect . Banksia ( 9 series , 50 species , 9 subspecies , 3 varieties ) 
 B. sect . Coccinea ( 1 species ) 
 B. sect . Oncostylis 
 B. ser . Spicigerae ( 7 species , 2 subspecies , 4 varieties ) 
 B. ser . Tricuspidae ( 1 species ) 
 B. ser . Dryandroideae ( 1 species ) 
 B. ser . Abietinae 
 B. sphaerocarpa 
 B. sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla 
 B. sphaerocarpa var. latifolia 
 B. sphaerocarpa var. pumilio 
 B. sphaerocarpa var. sphaerocarpa 
 B. sphaerocarpa var. caesia 
 B. micrantha 
 B. grossa 
 B. telmatiaea 
 B. leptophylla ( 2 varieties ) 
 B. lanata 
 B. scabrella 
 B. violacea 
 B. incana 
 B. laricina 
 B. pulchella 
 B. meisneri ( 2 subspecies ) 
 B. nutans ( 2 varieties ) 
 B. subg . Isostylis ( 3 species ) 
 A 2002 study by American botanists Austin Mast and Tom Givnish yielded a surprise when molecular analysis mapped out dolichostyla as a sister taxon to its geographical neighbour B. violacea , in a clade with B. laricina and B. incana . B. micrantha and the other two varieties of B. sphaerocarpa form a separate clade nearby . 
 Early in 2007 , Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by merging Dryandra into it , and publishing B. subg . Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon @-@ shaped cotyledons . They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete ; in the meantime , if Mast and Thiele 's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement , then B. sphaerocarpa is placed in B. subg . Spathulatae . 
 In 2008 , George reinstated B. sphaerocarpa var. latifolia , and published the new variety B. sphaerocarpa var. pumilio . 
 = = = Varieties = = = 
 Banksia sphaerocarpa is a widely distributed Western Australian species with four ( or five if one includes var. dolichostyla ) varieties : 
 B. sphaerocarpa var. caesia , first described by Alex George in his 1981 revision of the genus , grows larger than most other varieties , reaching 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) , or occasionally 4 m ( 13 ft ) , in height . It has yellow blooms and bluish grey foliage and is found in the central and southern Wheatbelt between the towns of <unk> , Kojonup , Newdegate and <unk> . 
 B. sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla ( Ironcap Banksia ) was first described by Alex George in his 1981 revision of the genus . It is the largest of the varieties , encountered as a large shrub or small tree to 4 m ( 13 ft ) high . It is larger in all parts than the other varieties , and has been considered a separate species . It is restricted to a small area from South Ironcap , east of Hyden , south to Mt Holland in the eastern Wheatbelt . 
 B. sphaerocarpa var. latifolia was originally described in a manuscript by Mueller and published by Bentham in 1870 . It grows as a small rounded shrub to 50 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) in height , and is restricted to the vicinity of the south coast between Denmark and the <unk> Range , where it is found in low , open forest of Eucalyptus marginata and E. calophylla . 
 B. sphaerocarpa var. sphaerocarpa is widely distributed from the Darling Plateau east of Perth to the Whicher Range in the southwest , and southeast to the Stirling Range . Populations north of Perth once referable to it are now classified as var. pumilio . 
 B. sphaerocarpa var. pumilio , first described by Alex George in 2008 , is a small shrub less than a metre high . It is found from Tathra National Park east of Eneabba south to the Chittering valley . Its subspecific name is derived from the Latin pumilio " small " , relating to the flowers . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Banksia sphaerocarpa is distributed widely across southwestern Western Australia — from Eneabba in the north , south to the Whicher Range , <unk> , Albany and Jerramungup , and eastwards to the vicinity of Hyden . It is mainly found on sandy soils in flat or gently sloped areas in shrubland , mallee or open woodland . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 As a species , B. sphaerocarpa is not considered to be under threat , but two of the five varieties , have been placed on the Declared Rare and Priority Flora List . B sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla has been gazetted as " Declared Rare Flora – Extant " under the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950 . Banksia sphaerocarpa var. latifolia , though not afforded legislative protection , has been identified as a " Priority Two – Poorly Known " taxon , because so few populations are known . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Various animals , including mammals , birds , and insects such as bees , wasps , ants and beetles , have been recorded visiting Banksia sphaerocarpa inflorescences , including the <unk> bee species Hylaeus <unk> . Botanist Stephen Hopper found pollen of B. sphaerocarpa on New Holland honeyeaters ( Phylidonyris novaehollandiae ) and honey possums ( Tarsipes rostratus ) at Cheyne Beach in a field study published in 1980 . 
 Knowledge of the breeding system of B. sphaerocarpa comes from a 2009 study of genetic structure within and across fragmented plant populations , which made a case study of B. sphaerocarpa var. caesia populations in the vicinity of <unk> , where the landscape has been severely fragmented by land clearing . Very little self @-@ pollination was observed . Most mating was between plants in the same population , but inter @-@ population mating accounted for 15 – 33 % of seed , a " very significant contribution ... to overall reproductive dynamics " . This figure was lowest in the smallest populations , which also exhibited lower rates of germination , smaller plants , and less genetic diversity than larger populations . One possible interpretation of this is that <unk> mating confers a fitness advantage . There was also evidence of fine @-@ scale genetic structure , with plants tending to be more closely related to nearby plants than to more distant plants . The authors suggest that gene flow was probably always limited in these populations , even before they were fragmented . 
 Banksia sphaerocarpa is one of five closely related Banksia species that have highly unusual flower nectar . Whereas other Banksia species produce nectar that is clear and watery , the nectar of these species is pale yellow initially , but gradually becomes darker and thicker , changing to a thick , olive @-@ green mucilage within one to two days of secretion , and eventually becoming " an almost black , gelatinous lump adhering to the base of the flowers " . It was first noted by Byron Lamont in 1980 ; he attributed it to cyanobacteria that feed off the nectar sugars . Noting that many of these cyanobacteria had heterocysts , he speculated that they aid the plant by fixing atmospheric nitrogen , which is then washed off the flower heads by rain , and absorbed by the proteoid root mat . This purported symbiosis was investigated by Barrett and Lamont in 1985 , but no evidence of nitrogen fixing was found . Further investigation by Markey and Lamont in 1996 suggested that the discolouration is not caused by cyanobacteria or other microorganisms in the nectar , but is rather " a chemical phenomenon of plant origin " . Their analyses indicated that the nectar had unusually high levels of sugar and free amino acids , but three of these species , including B. sphaerocarpa , have since been shown to have normal nectar sugar compositions . 
 Like most Western Australian Banksia species , B. sphaerocarpa is susceptible to dieback from the soil @-@ borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi . In one experiment , 43 % of plants were dead within three months of inoculation , and the species was therefore rated as " moderately susceptible " . In another experiment , 37 % of plants were dead within three months , and 85 % within a year ; yet this study rated the species ' susceptibility as " high " . In the latter study , it took 35 to 40 days for the death rate to reach its maximum , and thereafter the death rate continued at that level throughout the year , only dipping slightly in the dry summer months . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 None of the varieties of Banksia sphaerocarpa are commonly seen in cultivation . They are difficult to grow in the wetter conditions of Australia 's east coast . Trials with grafting have been very limited and results have been poor . Otherwise , they adapt well to gardens with good drainage , sandy soils and sunny aspects in drier and Mediterranean ( winter moisture ) climates , and are also frost tolerant . They are good bird @-@ attracting plants , and flower when not much else is in flower . Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing , and take 20 to 48 days to germinate . 
 = Hugh of Wells = 
 Hugh of Wells ( Hugh de Wells , or Hugh of Welles , sometimes Hugh <unk> ; died 7 February 1235 ) was a medieval Bishop of Lincoln . He began his career in the diocese of Bath , where he served two successive bishops , before joining royal service under King John of England . He served in the royal administration until 1209 , when he was elected to the see , or bishopric , of Lincoln . When John was excommunicated by Pope Innocent III in November 1209 , Hugh went into exile in France , where he remained until 1213 . 
 When he returned to England , he continued to serve both John and John 's son King Henry III , but spent most of his time in his diocese . He introduced new administrative methods into the diocese , as well as working to improve the educational and financial well @-@ being of his clergy and to secure the canonisation of his predecessor Hugh of Avalon as a saint in 1220 . Although the medieval writer Matthew Paris accused Hugh of being opposed to monastic houses and monks , there is little evidence of the bishop being biased , and after his death on 7 February 1235 parts of his estate were left to religious houses , including nunneries . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Hugh was the son of Edward of Wells and elder brother of Jocelin of Wells , Bishop of Bath . Hugh 's year of birth is unknown , but he was probably an old man at his death in 1235 . The fact that he never left his residence from March 1233 until his death implies that he was impaired from old age . He first appears as a witness on documents of Reginald fitzJocelin , the Bishop of Bath in the late 1180s . After fitzJocelin 's death in 1191 , Hugh continued in the service of the next bishop , Savaric FitzGeldewin . By the end of the 1190s , Hugh was a canon of Wells Cathedral . Although Hugh 's brother Jocelin was given the title of magister , implying that he attended a university , Hugh is never called magister , making it unlikely that he ever received much schooling . 
 Hugh was a keeper of the king 's seal , serving as deputy to Simon of Wells , the Archdeacon of Wells who was Keeper of the Great Seal from around 1199 to 1204 . Simon was also a relative of Hugh 's , and seems to have helped secure positions for both Hugh and Jocelin in the royal administration . Hugh was a royal clerk in the chancery , the royal secretariat , and was named Archdeacon of Wells sometime before 25 April 1204 . He held prebends in the diocese of Lincoln and diocese of London as well . His service in the chancery would have involved him in Hubert Walter 's administrative innovations during his term as Chancellor . 
 Besides his episcopal appointments , Hugh was rewarded with two manors in Somerset , including the Treasurer 's House in Martock which he made his primary residence , and the right to collect taxes and fines in two hundreds in Somerset . He also served as the royal custodian of the diocese of Lincoln while the see was vacant between 1200 and 1203 , collecting the revenues of the see , most of which went to the king while a see was without a bishop . In 1205 and 1206 , Hugh was royal custodian for the diocese of Bath , which was similarly vacant . 
 = = Bishop of Lincoln = = 
 Hugh was elected to the see of Lincoln about 14 April 1209 , after a papal command to the cathedral chapter to elect a new bishop , as Lincoln had again been without a bishop since 1206 . During the summer of 1209 , Hugh , along with his brother , was one of the councilors of King John urging the king to settle with Pope Innocent III before the pope excommunicated the king . However , negotiations with papal representatives got nowhere , and the king was excommunicated on 8 November 1209 . Hugh and his brother Jocelin had continued to support King John until this , two years after many of their fellow bishops had deserted the king , but by late in the year , Hugh left the king 's service and went into exile . 
 The election , meanwhile , had aroused papal suspicions of undue royal influence , and Innocent sent Stephen Langton , the exiled Archbishop of Canterbury to investigate Hugh and the circumstances of his election . Langton was also to investigate rumours that Hugh was not celibate , and had two daughters . The results of the investigation must have been satisfactory , as Hugh was consecrated on 20 December 1209 at Melun . The consecration was performed by Langton . Hugh was in exile in France until he returned to England on 16 July 1213 . His only known activity while in exile was the writing of a will , which was dated November 1212 and was drawn up at St Martin de <unk> , near Paris . 
 Hugh attended the papal Fourth Lateran Council held in 1215 in Rome , along with a number of other English bishops , and both English archbishops . Soon after his return from the council , Hugh served as a royal judge , serving as one of the justices of the eyre for Lincolnshire , Nottinghamshire , and Derbyshire in 1218 and 1219 . In 1226 he was once more a royal justice . Later , he was employed by King Henry III as an ambassador , helping negotiate with King Louis VIII of France over the status of Normandy and Poitou . Hugh also worked to secure the canonisation of his predecessor Hugh of Avalon as a saint , which occurred in 1220 . 
 = = Diocesan affairs = = 
 In 1222 , along with the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Norwich , Hugh ordered that all those in their dioceses refrain from contact with Jews . This decree , however , was countermanded by a royal decree to the county sheriffs in the affected dioceses ordering them to imprison any residents who refused to interact with Jews . Besides these activities , Hugh was active in his diocese , including supervising the various monastic houses within it . In 1227 , a visitation to Eynsham Abbey resulted in Hugh deposing the abbot . Although the 12th chronicler Matthew Paris accused Hugh of being biased against monks and nuns , and even called him the " untiring persecutor of monks , the hammer of canons , nuns and all the religious " , there is little evidence that Hugh singled out monks for persecution . One reason for Paris ' dislike of the bishop may have been the fact that the chronicler 's own abbey of St Alban 's had to compromise with Hugh over two legal disputes , dealing with the right to appoint to various benefices . 
 Hugh once was credited with creating 300 new vicarages within the diocese , largely on the basis of his surviving documents dealing with this , known as the Liber <unk> . Further research has shown that a number of the vicarages he was once assumed to have founded were instead earlier foundations that Hugh either augmented or reassessed . Hugh also worked to improve the educational level of this clergy , even refusing to allow some candidates to benefices to be installed because of their lack of education . The bishop also worked to improve the conditions of the poorer clergy in his diocese , attempting to ensure that all the clergy in his diocese had enough to live on . Previously , it was thought that Hugh had sent out a set of articles of inquiry to his diocesan clergy , but these articles are now shown to have been produced by Hugh 's successor , Robert Grosseteste . 
 In the administration of his diocese , Hugh introduced new methods of recording documents . This system was modelled on that which Hubert Walter had introduced into the chancery , with separate registers for each archdeaconry , and registers , or rolls , for charters and memoranda , much like the Charter Roll or Memoranda Roll of the royal chancery . He also undertook a survey of the endowments of the vicarages within his diocese . 
 Hugh supported the building campaign of Salisbury Cathedral , ordering that money be collected throughout his diocese . Likewise , he ordered similar collections for Daventry Priory , <unk> Abbey and parish churches in his diocese . Not only churches benefited from these sorts of collections , as the bishop offered indulgences to those who helped build bridges at Brampton , Rockingham , and <unk> . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Hugh died on 7 February 1235 , at his episcopal residence at Stow Park . He was buried on 10 February 1235 in Lincoln Cathedral , in the north aisle . In 1233 he had written a new will , which mentions his brother and a niece named Agatha . He left bequests to his family , his household , Lincoln Cathedral , and a number of monasteries in his diocese . What was left after the specific legacies was to be divided between poor religious houses , such as the Barrow Gurney Nunnery , students and teachers at Oxford University , Jewish converts and the poor on the episcopal manors . 
 Hugh 's register of ordinations still survives , and is in the Lincoln cathedral archives . Parts of this were published by Alfred Gibbons in 1888 , and others in 1904 by the Canterbury and York Society . These records give not only the name of the person receiving a benefice , but what the clerical status of each new benefice holder was . 
 = Panzer Dragoon = 
 Panzer Dragoon ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) is a rail shooter video game developed by Team Andromeda and released on the Sega Saturn console in 1995 ; and later released on R @-@ Zone , PC , PlayStation 2 , and as a bonus in its sequel Panzer Dragoon Orta for Xbox . The game follows the journey of Keil Fluge ( unnamed in localized versions ) , a member of a hunting party who becomes the rider of a powerful blue dragon ( red dragon in the R @-@ Zone version ) and joins it on its mission to stop a rival dragon from wreaking havoc on the world . The player moves an aiming reticle ( representing the dragon 's laser and the rider 's gun ) over the screen and shoots enemies while the dragon automatically flies through 3D environments on a predetermined track . 
 As one of six games available at the Sega Saturn 's surprise North American launch , Panzer Dragoon was the first game created by Team Andromeda . The game also marked the directorial debut of game designer Yukio Futatsugi , who was 25 years old at the time of the game 's release . It is the first game in the Panzer Dragoon series , and introduced the series ' gameplay elements and art style . 
 Panzer Dragoon received positive reviews , both in 1995 and in recent retrospective coverage . It was Electronic Gaming Monthly 's " Game of the Month " in July 1995 , was named " Best Saturn Game of 1995 " in EGM 's 1996 Buyers ' Guide , and ranked 140th in EGM 's " The Greatest 200 Videogames of their time " in 2006 . In particular , its original art direction and post @-@ apocalyptic science fantasy universe gained critical acclaim . It was followed by a prequel , Panzer Dragoon II Zwei , in 1996 , and two sequels : Panzer Dragoon Saga in 1998 , and Panzer Dragoon Orta in 2002 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The game spans six levels , each lasting about five minutes , with a variety of boss battles . Over the course of the game , the plot is revealed through cutscenes using the game 's own graphic engine . Gameplay consists of a player controls a flying dragon and his rider through an aiming reticle that can be moved over the whole screen with the D @-@ pad ; the player must shoot a variety of enemies ( ranging from machines to monsters ) in a 3D post @-@ apocalyptic fantasy environment of barren landscapes and mysterious ruins of a fallen civilization . Progression through the levels is made at a predetermined pace , as the player is constantly set along a rail of gameplay . The only time the game pauses is during boss battles . The field of vision can be directed with the aiming reticle on the x and y @-@ axis , but the overall direction of travel is predetermined . The dragon follows the reticle movements , allowing the player to avoid enemy projectiles and obstacles . 
 The player has a full , 360 @-@ degree field of view , and can quickly look left , right , forward , and behind the dragon . Enemies come from all directions , varying in size and health , and also appear on an on @-@ screen radar that monitors the dragon 's surroundings . Two weapons are available : the rider 's handgun , which can be fired with a single button press when an enemy enters the aiming reticle , and the homing laser fired by the dragon , which can lock on up to eight enemies by moving the reticle over them while holding down the fire button . Some situations with many enemies on screen require the use of the lock @-@ on laser , while in others , quick gunshots to weak spots will prove more efficient .
