 In September 2000 , the SBS was involved in Operation Barras , a hostage rescue operation in Sierra Leone . In November 2001 the SBS had an extensive role in the invasion of Afghanistan and were involved in the Battle of Tora Bora . The SBS was used in vital phases of the invasion of Afghanistan . A small SBS contingent secured Bagram Airbase prior to the deployment of larger forces that would become the main staging area for allied forces during Operation Enduring Freedom . Members of the SBS helped quell an Afghan prison revolt during the Battle of Qala @-@ i @-@ Jangi near Mazar @-@ i @-@ Sharif , in November 2001 . 
 In the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , M squadron was involved in a fierce firefight , which has since been commended by senior British officials . Sixty Men from M squadron with the call sign Zero Six Bravo travelled 1 @,@ 000 km ( 620 mi ) into Iraq to take the surrender of the Iraqi 5th Corps . The call @-@ sign was engaged in a fierce firefight that saw most of its vehicles destroyed . The SBS squadron escaped by splitting up , two men escaped on quad bikes to Syria . C squadron also had a 3 @-@ month tour in early 2003 . Corporal Ian Plank , an SBS operator attached to the SAS was killed by Iraqi insurgents during a house @-@ to @-@ house search for a wanted high @-@ ranking Islamist terrorist in an insurgent compound in Ramadi on 31 October 2003 , he was the first UKSF combat casualty of the Iraq War . The SBS was also very active as part of Task Force Black , C squadron deployed to Baghdad as part of the task force in 2004 , in its four @-@ month deployment it mounted 22 raids . 
 In Spring 2005 , the Director of Special Forces rebalanced British special forces deployments so that Afghanistan would be the responsibility of the SBS and Iraq would be the 22nd SAS Regiment 's . In Spring 2006 , the British military deployed over 4 @,@ 000 troops to southern Afghanistan and the SBS were assigned to take the lead in supporting the deployment . The main objective of the SBS ( and later on other British special forces units with Afghan forces ) was targeting Taliban leaders and drug barons using " Carrot and stick " tactics . On 27 June 2006 , Captain David Patten , SAS ( other sources say <unk> ) and Sergeant Paul Bartlett , SBS , were killed and another serviceman seriously injured in a Taliban ambush in Helmand province , southern Afghanistan . They were part of an SBS patrol that had arrested 4 Taliban organisers when they were ambushed by a large Taliban force , their vehicles were destroyed and the team were pursued by at least 70 Taliban insurgents , they were rescued by a platoon of Gurkhas who were supported by US and British aircraft , however in the chaos ; Bartlett and Patten became separated from the main group , their bodies were later found . One SBS member was awarded the MC On 12 May 2007 , an SBS team killed the Taliban leader Mullah <unk> in Helmand province after a raid on a compound where his associates were meeting . On 24 September 2007 , members of the SBS and Italian commando 's rescued two Italian intelligence officers who were kidnapped by the Taliban in Herat province near Farah , they had been kidnapped 2 days before ; the mission was successful the officers were rescued and all 8 or 9 Taliban were killed . On 18 February 2008 , Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Matin and one of his sub @-@ commanders , Mullah Karim Agha , were travelling through the desert in Helmand province on motorbikes when they were ambushed and killed by an SBS unit dropped into his path by helicopter . In February 2009 , members of the SBS took part in Operation Diesel , which resulted in the seizure of £ 50 million of heroin and the killing of at least 20 Taliban insurgents . On 9 September 2009 , a joint SAS @-@ SBS team supported by the SFSG rescued Times journalist Stephen Farrell after he was captured by the Taliban in Kunduz Province . On 1 July 2010 whilst carrying out an operation against insurgents in Haji Wakil , Helmand Province , Corporal Seth Stephens of the SBS was killed during a heavy firefight whilst clearing a compound , as a result of his actions during that operation , he was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross . On 15 April 2012 , during the Taliban attack on Kabul SBS operators cleared Taliban militants from a central location overlooking foreign embassies . 
 On 27 February 2011 , during the Libyan Civil War , the BBC reported that C Squadron assisted in the evacuation of 150 oil workers in three flights by RAF C @-@ 130 Hercules from an airfield near Zella to Valletta . 
 On 8 March 2012 , a small Special Boat Service ( SBS ) team , attempted to rescue two hostages , Chris McManus ( British ) and Franco <unk> ( Italian ) , being held in Nigeria by members of the Boko Haram terrorist organisation loyal to al @-@ Qaeda . The two hostages were killed before or during the rescue attempt . All the hostage takers were reportedly killed . In 2013 , Captain Richard Holloway was serving with the SBS when he was killed by two Taliban bullets while conducting an operation to suppress the Taliban in a joint SBS @-@ Afghan forces raid ( with air support ) on Taliban insurgents in a valley east of Kabul ahead of the Afghanistan elections .

 The Ministry of Defence does not comment on special forces matters , therefore little verifiable information exists in the public domain . The SBS is under the Operational Command of Director Special Forces and are based in Hamworthy barracks , Poole , Dorset . 
 In 1987 , when renamed the Special Boat Service , the SBS was also reformed along SAS lines , with 16 man troops instead of the traditional sections . About 200 – 250 men make up the SBS at any one time , and once qualified , personnel are known as " Swimmer <unk> " . They are experts in swimming , diving , parachuting , navigation , demolition and reconnaissance . 
 There are four active squadrons and a reserve unit : 
 Since the SBS joined the UKSF Group in the 1980s it has been restructured . Instead of one squadron being tasked with a permanent role the unit adopted the same system of squadron rotation as the SAS . Each Squadron rotates through Counter Terrorism Duties and Conventional Operations and tasking . For example , in December 2001 it was C squadron who were on MCT Role and were called in to intercept the MV Nisha while M and Z Squadron were deployed in Afghanistan . 
 C Squadron 
 X Squadron

 SBS Reserve or SBS ( R ) – provides individual reservists to augment the regular SBS , rather than forming independent teams . Only candidates with previous military experience are eligible to enlist . The SBS ( R ) is located at locations throughout the United Kingdom , but training is carried out in the South of England . 
 = = = Recruitment , selection and training = = = 
 In the past , the SBS was staffed almost entirely by the Royal Marines . Volunteers for the SBS are now taken from all branches of the British Armed Forces , although volunteers still predominantly come from the Royal Marines Commandos . Candidates wishing to serve with the SBS must have completed two years regular service and will only be accepted into the SBS after completion of the selection process . 
 Until recently , the SBS had its own independent selection programme in order to qualify as a Swimmer <unk> , but its selection program has now been integrated into a joint UKSF selection alongside candidates for the SAS . All male members of the United Kingdom armed forces can be considered for special forces selection , but historically the majority of candidates have an airborne forces background . There are two selections a year , one in winter and the other in summer , and all the instructors are full members of the Special Air Service Regiment . 
 Before being loaded on to a UKSF Selection course , a candidate must complete a two @-@ week Special Forces Briefing Course . The course tests the candidates physical fitness and looks of their willingness to conduct water @-@ borne operations . 
 The UKSF course is broken down into two main parts , Selection and Continuation Training . 
 Selection 
 Aptitude Phase ( hill phase ) – 4 weeks . This phase is conducted in the Brecon Beacons , South Wales . 
 The Aptitude Phase is designed to select those individuals who are suitable for Special Forces training . The initial three weeks are devoted to gradual physical training and progressive exercises designed to develop physical and navigational ability . Volunteers will be expected to complete the Basic Combat Fitness Test ( Infantry ) on the first day of the course . Exercise HIGH WALK ( Fan dance ) will take place on Day 6 and takes the form of an escorted hill march over approximately 23 km ( 14 mi ) . As with all assessment marches , additional time may be added for inclement weather conditions . Exercise HIGH WALK identifies those individuals that are not adequately prepared to continue on the course . All other training during this initial period is directed at preparing volunteers for " Test Week " which is the fourth and final week of Aptitude . " Test Week " consists of five timed marches of between 23 – 28 km ( 14 – 17 mi ) conducted on consecutive days followed by a final Endurance march of 64 km ( 40 mi ) ; this must be completed within 20 hours . Bergen weights carried during " Test Week " increase from 40 lb ( 18 kg ) to 55 lb ( 25 kg ) for the Endurance march ; in addition a rifle is carried on all marches . Volunteers are also required to pass the UKSF swimming test that consists of ; high water entry ( 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) ) , treading water for nine minutes followed immediately by a swim of 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) wearing Combat 95 . The test finishes with an underwater swim of 10 m ( 33 ft ) including a retrieval of a small weight . 
 Continuation Training 
 Tactics , Techniques and Procedures ( <unk> ) – 9 weeks 
 Those who pass the Aptitude Phase will undertake an intensive period of instruction and assessment of Special Forces Tactics , Techniques and Procedures ( <unk> ) , including SF weapons and Standard Operation Procedures . The majority of this period is spent in the jungle , an environment that is suitable for SF training and ideal to achieve the purpose of this phase . Much of the training is aimed at discovering an individual 's qualities . Continuation training , which consists of SOP and Tactical training in temperate and jungle environments , lasts nine weeks . This is conducted in the UK and Brunei . 
 Employment Training – 14 weeks 
 Employment Training consists of surveillance and reconnaissance training ( 2 weeks ) , army combat survival ( 2 weeks ) , SF parachute training ( 4 weeks ) , counter terrorist course ( 3 weeks ) , signals training ( 1 week ) , patrol training and squadron induction training ( 2 weeks ) , and 1 week officers week for potential officers . At the end of the resistance to interrogation phase the surviving candidates are transferred to an operational squadron . 
 When accepted into an operational squadron , the candidates must complete the SBS Swimmer <unk> Course , <unk> Course . The course lasts for several months and covers long distance Dives , <unk> and <unk> in open sea , often in poor weather . Underwater demolitions , Maritime counter terrorism , are also practised . On completing SBS troopers will be put on one year probation . 
 Reserve selection 
 For SBS ( R ) selection , only candidates with previous military experience are eligible to enlist . Training is carried out in the South of England and candidates are required to complete the following tests over the four @-@ day initial selection course : 
 Combat Fitness Test ( CFT ) – 12 @.@ 8 km ( 8 mi ) carrying 25 kg ( 55 lb ) within 1 hour 50 minutes . 
 Swim test – 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) using any stroke in uniform and retrieve an object from 5 m ( 16 ft ) . 
 Gym tests . 
 Advanced CFT 1 – 15 km ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) carrying 25 kg ( 55 lb ) . 
 Advanced CFT 2 – 24 km ( 15 mi ) carrying 30 kg ( 66 lb ) . 
 The Special Boat Service wear the green commando beret , but with their own cap badge . 
 = The Obvious Child = 
 " The Obvious Child " is a song recorded by American singer @-@ songwriter Paul Simon . It was the lead single from his eighth studio album , The Rhythm of the Saints ( 1990 ) , released by Warner Bros. Records . Written by Simon , its lyrics explore mortality and aging . The song is accompanied by a performance from Brazilian drumming collective Olodum in a live recording . Simon wrote his lyrics to complement the song 's rhythm ; in following this approach he wrote many passages that could be considered nonsensical . 
 The single , released in September 1990 , was commercially successful , performing well on charts worldwide . In the United States , it was mainly successful on the Album Rock Tracks chart , where it peaked at number 21 . Outside the US , " The Obvious Child " was a top 15 hit in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands . The song received highly positive reviews upon its release . Simon promoted the song alongside Olodum in a performance on Saturday Night Live . The song also influenced popular culture ; it is the namesake of the 2014 film Obvious Child . 
 = = Background = = 
 The rhythm tracks are performed by Grupo Cultural Olodum , a drumming collective ( " <unk> afro " ) directed by " <unk> do Samba " ( Alves de Souza ) and also signed to Warner Bros. It , like many songs on The Rhythm of the Saints , was recorded live in the streets of Pelourinho Square of Salvador , Brazil in February 1988 . Microphones were hung from windows or on telephone poles to capture the performances . According to Simon , " Hundreds of people gathered . It was an amazing day — an amazing recording experience . " The vocal track was recorded at the Hit Factory in New York City . 
 = = Composition = = 
 The song 's drum introduction is indebted to " Madagascar " , a song by Olodum from their 1987 LP <unk> <unk> . Writer Steve Sullivan writes that the figure is a " standard device " for the group , who also employ abbreviated versions of it elsewhere on the album : " Salvador Nao <unk> " and " <unk> Cuba @-@ Brasil " . Following this , the song breaks into an instrumental fragment that , according to Stephen Holden of The New York Times , echoes the Silhouettes ' 1957 doo @-@ wop hit , " Get a Job " . Holden also compared the song 's conclusion to another doo @-@ wop song , the Charts ' " <unk> " ( 1957 ) . 
 The song 's lyrics thematically relate to a fear of aging and leaving behind the " boldness of youth , " according to Sullivan . Holden considered it a story of an everyman pondering the uncertainty of life whilst navigating his high school yearbook . Rolling Stone 's John <unk> too found it an everyman battling the fact that his " days have become defined by their limitations and dogged ordinariness . " For The Rhythm of the Saints , Simon was inspired by poet Derek Walcott , and would base first @-@ draft lyrics on his poems . Simon attempted to match the rhythmic quality of the composition with his lyrics , whether that meant a lyric was meaningless or not . A lyric relating to " the cross is in the ballpark , " for example , has no meaning ; Simon said , " I found [ it ] to be a satisfying rhythmic phrase against the drums . " 
 = = Chart performance = = 
 " The Obvious Child " performed well on singles charts in several territories worldwide . In the United States , the song reached a peak of number 92 on the Billboard Hot 100 on January 5 , 1991 ; it spent five weeks on the chart as a whole . It performed better on the magazine 's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart , where it placed at number 21 on November 10 , 1990 , and on the Modern Rock Tracks chart , where it reached a peak of number 24 a week earlier on November 3 . It had more longevity on the former chart , where it spent ten weeks total . In Canada , the song first debuted on the RPM 100 on October 20 , 1990 at position 98 . It peaked at number 28 during the week of December 8 , 1990 , and remained at that peak for two weeks . 
 Internationally , the single performed better . In the United Kingdom , the song premiered on the UK Singles Chart on September 30 , 1990 at number 61 , and rose over the following weeks to a peak of number fifteen on November 4 , 1990 . It charted best in the Netherlands ' Nationale Top 100 , where it reached a peak of number 12 . On Belgium 's Ultratop 50 , it hit number 29 . In Australasian territories , it charted right outside the top 40 : in Australia , the song reached number 42 , and in New Zealand , it peaked at number 46 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Upon its release , " The Obvious Child " received positive reviews from music critics of the time . Stephen Holden of The New York Times was perhaps the most effusive : 
 Greg Sandow of Entertainment Weekly praised the song 's " confident drums that resound with special exuberant zing . " A reviewer for People felt that " the more exotic musical elements are subsumed by Simon 's pretty pop structures [ ... ] You never get the impression that Paul has truly gone native or even considered it . He 's more like a kid camping under the stars in his own backyard . " 
 Reviews have continued to be very positive over time . Writer Steve Sullivan , in his book Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings , Volume 1 ( 2013 ) , calls the song " an extraordinary work that surpasses any individual song Paul Simon had ever produced as a solo artist . " Cameron <unk> , in a 2014 article for The A.V. Club , examined the song ; he called it " the perfect confluence of the wild , frenetic drumming and Simon 's folksy melodies . "

 = Renown @-@ class battlecruiser = 
 The Renown class comprised a pair of battlecruisers built during the First World War for the Royal Navy . They were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge @-@ class battleships . Their construction was suspended on the outbreak of war on the grounds they would not be ready in a timely manner . Admiral Lord Fisher , upon becoming First Sea Lord , gained approval to restart their construction as battlecruisers that could be built and enter service quickly . The Director of Naval Construction ( DNC ) , Eustace Tennyson @-@ D 'Eyncourt , quickly produced an entirely new design to meet Admiral Lord Fisher 's requirements and the builders agreed to deliver the ships in 15 months . They did not quite meet that ambitious goal , but they were delivered a few months after the Battle of Jutland in 1916 . They were the world 's largest and fastest capital ships upon completion . 
 Repulse was the only ship of her class to see combat in the First World War when she participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917 . Both ships were reconstructed twice between the wars ; the 1920s reconstruction increased their armour protection and made lesser improvements , while the 1930s reconstruction was much more thorough , especially for Renown . Repulse accompanied the battlecruiser Hood during the Special Service Squadron 's round @-@ the @-@ world cruise in 1923 – 24 and protected British interests during the Spanish Civil War between 1936 – 39 . Renown frequently conveyed royalty on their foreign tours and served as flagship of the Battlecruiser Squadron when Hood was refitting . 
 Both ships served during the Second World War ; they searched for the Admiral Graf Spee in 1939 , participated in the Norwegian Campaign of April – June 1940 and searched for the German battleship Bismarck in 1941 . Repulse was sunk on 10 December 1941 in the South China Sea off Kuantan , Pahang by Japanese aircraft . Renown spent much of 1940 and 1941 assigned to Force H at Gibraltar , escorting convoys and she fought in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento . She was briefly assigned to the Home Fleet and provided cover to several Arctic convoys in early 1942 . The ship was transferred back to Force H for Operation Torch and spent much of 1943 refitting or transporting Winston Churchill and his staff to and from various conferences with various Allied leaders . In early 1944 Renown was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean where she supported numerous attacks on Japanese @-@ occupied facilities in Indonesia and various island groups in the Indian Ocean . The ship returned to the Home Fleet in early 1945 and was refitted before being placed in reserve after the end of the war . Renown was sold for scrap in 1948 .

 = = = Improved Revenge @-@ class battleships = = = 
 The battleships of the 1914 Naval Programme consisted of three improved Revenge @-@ class ships , named Renown , Repulse and Resistance , and one further member of the Queen Elizabeth class , called Agincourt . Resistance and Agincourt were to be built in Royal dockyards while Renown was awarded to Fairfield and Repulse to Palmers . The design was approved on 13 May 1914 and the improvements over the Revenge class consisted of : 
 A consistent thickness of 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) for the protective wing bulkheads . 
 An enlarged torpedo control tower . 
 An enlarged conning tower with the armour rearranged for better access . 
 A protected spotting position in the bow . 
 The width of the keel was increased to provide a more rigid structure amidships to resist stress while docking . 
 Shell stowage for the main guns was increased from 80 rounds per gun to 100 . 
 These changes would have done little to change the size of the ships in comparison to their predecessors other than a decrease in draught to 28 feet 6 inches ( 8 @.@ 7 m ) , 1 foot 6 inches ( 45 @.@ 7 cm ) less than the older ships . They would , however , have been 2 knots ( 3 @.@ 7 km / h ; 2 @.@ 3 mph ) slower than the Revenge @-@ class ships as they were to be provided with only 31 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 23 @,@ 000 kW ) rather than the 40 @,@ 000 shp ( 30 @,@ 000 kW ) of their predecessors . 
 Work on all four ships was suspended at the beginning of the First World War and the two ships to be built in the Royal dockyards were cancelled on 26 August 1914 , as it was believed that they could not be completed before the end of the war . Admiral Lord Fisher , once he returned to office as First Sea Lord in October , began pressuring Winston Churchill , then First Lord of the Admiralty , to allow him to convert the suspended contracts for Renown and Repulse into a new class of battlecruisers capable of the very high speed of 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) . Churchill argued that their construction would interfere with other construction programmes , absorb too many resources , and still could not be finished in time . Fisher countered by arguing he could keep the building time to a minimum , as he had done with Dreadnought , by using as much material ordered for the battleships as possible , including their 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) gun turrets . Churchill was unmoved , however , until the experiences of Battle of Heligoland Bight in August and the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December , seemed to demonstrate that high speed and heavy gun power was a potent combination and vindicated Fisher 's long @-@ held belief on the viability of the battlecruiser . These actions , plus pressure from Admiral Jellicoe , commander of the Grand Fleet , and Vice Admiral Beatty , commander of the Battlecruiser Force , caused Churchill to gain approval from the Cabinet to build two ships on 28 December . 
 = = = Battlecruisers = = = 
 Admiral Lord Fisher first presented his requirements for the new ships to the DNC on 18 December , before they had even been approved . He wanted a long , high , flared bow , like that on the pre @-@ dreadnought HMS Renown , but higher , four 15 @-@ inch guns in two twin turrets , an anti @-@ torpedo boat armament of twenty 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) guns mounted high up and protected by gun shields only , speed of 32 knots using oil fuel , and armour on the scale of the battlecruiser Indefatigable . Within a few days , however , Fisher increased the number of guns to six and added two torpedo tubes . Minor revisions in the initial estimate were made until 26 December , and a preliminary design was completed on 30 December . 
 During the following week the DNC 's department examined the material delivered for the two battleships and decided what could be used in the new design and the contract for Repulse was transferred from Palmers to John Brown & Company because the former lacked a slipway long enough to use for the new ship . The usable material was transferred to John Brown and both builders had received enough information from the DNC 's department to lay the keels of both ships on 25 January 1915 , well before the altered contracts were completed on 10 March !

 The Renown @-@ class ships had an overall length of 794 feet 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 242 @.@ 0 m ) , a beam of 90 feet 1 @.@ 75 inches ( 27 @.@ 5 m ) , and a draught of 30 feet 2 inches ( 9 @.@ 2 m ) at deep load . They displaced 27 @,@ 320 long tons ( 27 @,@ 760 t ) at standard load and 32 @,@ 220 long tons ( 32 @,@ 740 t ) at deep load . While 90 feet ( 27 @.@ 4 m ) longer than their predecessor , Tiger , they displaced 2 @,@ 780 long tons ( 2 @,@ 820 t ) less than the older ship at deep load . 
 The ships proved to be good sea boats , but had to be reinforced while under construction with additional stiffening and pillars under the forecastle deck to cure some minor structural problems forward . They had a metacentric height of 6 @.@ 2 feet ( 1 @.@ 9 m ) at deep load as built as well as a complete double bottom . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The original plan for these ships was to use lightweight machinery producing a total of 110 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 82 @,@ 000 kW ) , but that would have required a considerable amount of time to complete its design . Rather than risk delaying the completion of the ships the machinery from HMS Tiger was duplicated with the addition of three extra boilers to provide the required power needed for the additional speed . Each ship had two paired sets of Brown @-@ Curtis direct @-@ drive steam turbines , housed in separate engine @-@ rooms . Each set comprised high @-@ pressure ahead and astern turbines driving an outboard shaft and low @-@ pressure ahead and astern turbines , housed in the same casing , driving an inner shaft . Their three @-@ bladed propellers were 13 feet 6 inches ( 4 @.@ 11 m ) in diameter . The turbines were powered by 42 Babcock & Wilcox water @-@ tube boilers in six boiler rooms at a working pressure of 235 psi ( 1 @,@ 620 kPa ; 17 kgf / cm2 ) . They were designed to produce a total of 112 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 84 @,@ 000 kW ) , but achieved more than 126 @,@ 000 shp ( 93 @,@ 958 kW ) during Renown 's trials , when she reached a speed of 32 @.@ 58 knots ( 60 @.@ 34 km / h ; 37 @.@ 49 mph ) . They were the fastest capital ships in existence until the arrival of Hood in 1920 . 
 They were designed to normally carry 1 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ 016 t ) of fuel oil , but had a maximum capacity of 4 @,@ 289 long tons ( 4 @,@ 358 t ) . At full capacity , the Renown @-@ class ships could steam at a speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) for 4 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 410 km ; 4 @,@ 600 mi ) . The ships had two reciprocating steam @-@ driven 200 @-@ kilowatt ( 270 hp ) dynamos , one oil @-@ driven 150 @-@ kilowatt ( 200 hp ) dynamo , and one turbine @-@ driven 200 @-@ kilowatt ( 270 hp ) dynamo that supplied the common ring main at 220 volts . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The Renown @-@ class ships mounted six 42 @-@ calibre BL 15 @-@ inch Mk I guns in three twin hydraulically powered gun turrets , designated " A " , " B " , and " Y " from front to rear . The guns could be depressed to − 3 ° and elevated to 20 ° ; they could be loaded at any angle up to 20 ° , although loading at high angles tended to slow the gun 's return to battery ( firing position ) . The ships carried 120 shells per gun . They fired 1 @,@ 910 @-@ pound ( 866 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 575 ft / s ( 785 m / s ) ; this provided a maximum range of 23 @,@ 734 yd ( 21 @,@ 702 m ) with armour @-@ piercing shells . 
 The ships were designed with seventeen 45 @-@ calibre BL 4 @-@ inch Mark IX guns , fitted in five triple and two single mounts . These were manually powered and quite cumbersome in use as they required a crew of thirty @-@ two men to load and train the triple gun mounts . The gun 's rate of fire was only 10 to 12 rounds per minute as the loaders kept getting in each other 's way . They had a maximum depression of − 10 ° and a maximum elevation of 30 ° . They fired a 31 @-@ pound ( 14 kg ) high @-@ explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 625 ft / s ( 800 m / s ) . At maximum elevation the guns had a maximum range of 13 @,@ 500 yards ( 12 @,@ 344 m ) . The ships carried 200 rounds for each gun . 
 Each ship mounted a pair of QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti @-@ aircraft guns on single high @-@ angle mountings . These were mounted on the shelter deck abreast the rear funnel . The gun had a maximum depression of 10 ° and a maximum elevation of 90 ° . It fired a 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 500 ft / s ( 760 m / s ) at a rate of fire of 12 – 14 rounds per minute . They had a maximum effective ceiling of 23 @,@ 500 ft ( 7 @,@ 200 m ) . Both ships carried ten torpedoes and mounted two 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) submerged torpedo tubes fitted just forward of " A " barbette . 
 = = = Fire control = = = 
 The main guns of the Renown @-@ class ships could be controlled from either of the two fire @-@ control directors . The primary director was mounted above the conning tower in an armoured hood and the other was in the fore @-@ top on the foremast . Data from a rangefinder in the armoured hood was input into a Mk IV * Dreyer Fire Control Table located in the Transmitting Station ( TS ) where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns . The target 's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target . The secondary armament was controlled by directors mounted on platforms on each mast . Each turret was provided with a 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) rangefinder in an armoured housing on the turret roof . 
 During the war the number and size of rangefinders increased . By 1918 Renown carried two 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) rangefinders , one on " Y " turret and the other in the armoured hood above the conning tower . Fifteen @-@ foot rangefinders were mounted on " A " and " B " turrets , the torpedo control tower abaft the mainmast , and the armoured hood . The fore @-@ top was equipped with a 12 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) rangefinder and the anti @-@ aircraft guns were controlled by a simple 6 @-@ foot @-@ 6 @-@ inch ( 1 @.@ 98 m ) rangefinder mounted on the aft superstructure . Two 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) rangefinders were mounted on the bridge . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The armour protection of the Renown @-@ class ships was similar to that of Indefatigable ; her waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour measured 6 inches ( 152 mm ) thick amidships . It ran from the midpoint of " A " barbette to the midpoint of " Y " barbette , a length of 462 feet ( 140 @.@ 8 m ) , and was 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) high . Strakes of three @-@ inch armour aft and four @-@ inch armour forward continued the belt towards the ends of the ship , although neither reached the bow or the stern . The strakes were enclosed by transverse bulkheads of the same thickness . For much of the length of the main belt there was an upper belt of high @-@ tensile steel , 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) thick , intended as splinter protection . 
 The gun turrets were 9 inches ( 229 mm ) thick on the face and front sides , 7 inches ( 178 mm ) thick on the rear side plates while their roofs were 4 @.@ 25 inches ( 108 mm ) thick . The barbettes were protected by 7 inches ( 178 mm ) of armour above the upper deck , but it thinned to 4 – 5 inches ( 102 – 127 mm ) below the deck . The conning tower sides were 10 inches ( 254 mm ) thick and it had a three @-@ inch roof . The walls of the communication tube were three inches thick . The torpedo control tower had 3 @-@ inch walls and a 1 @.@ 5 @-@ inch cast steel roof . 
 As designed the high @-@ tensile @-@ steel decks ranged from 0 @.@ 75 to 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 19 to 38 mm ) in thickness . After the Battle of Jutland in 1916 , while the ships were still completing , an extra inch of high @-@ tensile steel was added on the main deck over the magazines . Despite these additions , the ships were still felt to be too vulnerable to plunging fire and each ship was refitted in Rosyth in 1916 – 17 with additional horizontal armour , weighing approximately 504 long tons ( 512 t ) , added to the decks over the magazines and over the steering mechanism . 
 The Renown @-@ class ships were fitted with a shallow anti @-@ torpedo bulge integral to the hull which was intended to explode the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and vent the underwater explosion to the surface rather than into the ship . However , later testing proved that it was not deep enough to accomplish its task as it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion .

 Both ships spent much of the remainder of 1916 and early 1917 in the hands of dockyards having their armour upgraded and conducting routine patrols of the North Sea . They were assigned to the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron ( BCS ) for the duration of the war . Repulse relieved Lion as flagship of the 1st BCS .

 Over the course of 1917 the Admiralty became more concerned about German efforts in the North Sea to sweep paths through the British @-@ laid minefields intended to restrict the actions of the High Seas Fleet and German submarines . A preliminary raid on German minesweeping forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed ten small ships and the Admiralty decided on a larger operation to destroy the minesweepers and their escorting light cruisers . Based on intelligence reports the Admiralty decided on 17 November 1917 to allocate two light cruiser squadrons , the 1st Cruiser Squadron covered by the reinforced 1st BCS ( less Renown ) and , more distantly , the battleships of the 1st Battle Squadron to the operation . 
 The German ships , four light cruisers of II Scouting Force , eight destroyers , three divisions of minesweepers , eight <unk> ( cork @-@ filled trawlers , used to detonate mines without sinking ) and two trawlers to mark the swept route , were spotted at 7 : 30 a.m. , silhouetted by the rising sun . The light battlecruiser Courageous and the light cruiser Cardiff opened fire with their forward guns seven minutes later . The Germans responded by laying an effective smoke screen . The British continued in pursuit , but lost track of most of the smaller ships in the smoke and concentrated fire on the light cruisers as opportunity permitted . Repulse was detached not long after and raced forward at full speed to engage the enemy ships . She opened fire at about 9 : 00 , scoring a single hit on the light cruiser SMS Königsberg during the battle . When the German battleships SMS Kaiser and SMS Kaiserin were spotted about 9 : 50 the British broke off their pursuit and Repulse covered their retreat , aided by a heavy fog that came down around 10 : 40 . 
 In September 1917 Repulse became the first capital ship to be fitted with aircraft flying @-@ off platforms on her turrets . A Sopwith Pup successfully took off from the platform mounted on " B " turret on 1 October and repeated his achievement on 9 October from " Y " turret . Renown received her platforms in early 1918 . 
 On 12 December 1917 Renown put to sea with other elements of the fleet in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept the German 3rd Half @-@ Flotilla of destroyers that had destroyed the Scandinavian convoy and most of its escorts . For the rest of the war the two ships patrolled the North Sea uneventfully . Both ships were present at the surrender of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918 . 
 = = = Inter @-@ war service = = = 
 Repulse began a major refit at Portsmouth on 17 December 1918 intended to drastically improve her armour protection . Her existing 6 @-@ inch armour belt was replaced by 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) armour plates made surplus by the conversion of the battleship Almirante Cochrane ( originally ordered by Chile and purchased after the war began ) to the aircraft carrier Eagle . The old armour was fitted between the main and upper decks , above the new armour belt . Additional high @-@ tensile plating was added to the decks over the magazines . The ship 's anti @-@ torpedo bulge was deepened and reworked along the lines of that installed on the battleship Ramillies . The bulge covered her hull from the submerged torpedo room to " Y " magazine and the inner compartments of which were filled with crushing tubes . The bulges added 12 feet 8 inches ( 3 @.@ 9 m ) to her beam and 1 foot 4 inches ( 0 @.@ 4 m ) to her draught . The refit added about 4 @,@ 500 long tons ( 4 @,@ 600 t ) to her displacement and raised her metacentric height to 6 @.@ 4 feet ( 2 @.@ 0 m ) at deep load . Three 30 @-@ foot rangefinders were also added as well as eight torpedo tubes in twin mounts on the upper deck . Both flying @-@ off platforms were removed . 
 When the Grand Fleet was disbanded in April 1919 Renown was assigned to the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet . In June she was refitted in preparation for a tour of Canada , Newfoundland and the United States by Edward , the Prince of Wales , and both flying @-@ off platforms were removed . From January to March 1920 Renown was refitted more extensively as a " royal yacht " . Her aft 4 @-@ inch mounting and both 3 @-@ inch AA guns were removed so that extra accommodation and a promenade deck could be built . A large deckhouse was built on the shelter deck between the funnels . The port side housed a squash court while the starboard side was a cinema . The ship sailed in March for Australia and New Zealand with the Prince of Wales and his entourage aboard and made many stops en route . She returned to Portsmouth in October and was placed in reserve in November . 
 Renown was recommissioned in September 1921 for a tour of India and Japan by the Prince of Wales and sailed from Portsmouth in October . The ship arrived back in Portsmouth in June 1922 and she was placed in reserve the following month . The ship began a reconstruction that same month along the lines of her sister , although changes were made based on the experiences with Repulse . Renown 's main armour belt was removed and a new 9 @-@ inch belt was installed , using up the remaining plates leftover from Almirante Cochrane as well as new armour , but installed about 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) higher than on Repulse to offset any increase in draught . A strake of tapered armour was fitted underneath the main belt to deflect any shell that dived beneath the water 's surface ; it was 9 @-@ inches thick at top and thinned to 2 inches ( 51 mm ) at the bottom . The ship 's deck armour was heavily reinforced adjacent to its machinery spaces and magazines . Two longitudinal bulkheads were added between the upper and main decks that ran from the base of the conning tower to the end of the boiler rooms . The bulges were reworked and based on those used in the Queen Elizabeth @-@ class battleships although crushing tubes were only used abreast the magazines . The rear triple 4 @-@ inch gun mount was replaced . The flying @-@ off platform on " B " turret was reinstated and a high @-@ angle control position ( HACP ) was added to the fore @-@ top . The pair of 3 @-@ inch AA guns and her two single four @-@ inch gun mounts were removed and replaced with four QF four @-@ inch Mark V anti @-@ aircraft guns . They had a maximum depression of -5 ° and a maximum elevation of 80 ° . They fired a 31 @-@ pound ( 14 kg ) high explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 387 ft / s ( 728 m / s ) at a rate of ten to fifteen rounds per minute . The guns had a maximum ceiling of 31 @,@ 000 ft ( 9 @,@ 400 m ) , but an effective range of much less . The reconstruction only added 3 @,@ 500 long tons ( 3 @,@ 600 t ) to the ship 's displacement and three inches to her draught . 
 Repulse was recommissioned on 1 January 1921 and joined the Battlecruiser Squadron . In November 1923 , Hood , accompanied by Repulse and a number of Danae @-@ class cruisers of the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron , set out on a world cruise from west to east via the Panama Canal . They returned home ten months later in September 1924 . Shortly after her return the ship 's pair of 3 @-@ inch AA guns and her two single four @-@ inch gun mounts were removed and replaced with four QF four @-@ inch Mark V AA guns . The Battlecruiser Squadron visited Lisbon in February 1925 to participate in the Vasco da Gama celebrations before continuing on the Mediterranean for exercises . A squash court was added on the starboard side between the funnels for the Prince of Wales ' tour of Africa and South America that lasted from March to October . Upon her return she was refitted from November 1925 to July 1926 and had a HACP added to her fore @-@ top . 
 Renown finished her reconstruction in September 1926 and she was assigned to the Battlecruiser Squadron until the ship was detached to convey Prince Albert of York to Australia between January and July 1927 . Upon her return she rejoined the Atlantic Fleet . Renown became the flagship of the BCS when Hood was refitting between 1929 and 1931 . Hood reassumed the role as flagship after she was recommissioned and Renown was paid off for a refit of her own . A High @-@ Angle Control System Mark I was fitted with a director on the roof of the fore @-@ top that replaced the high @-@ angle rangefinder and the conning tower platform was enlarged to accommodate a pair of Mk V octuple mountings for the QF 2 @-@ pounder Mk VIII gun The Mk V mounts could depress to − 10 ° and elevate to a maximum of 80 ° . The Mark VIII 2 @-@ pounder gun fired a 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) .91 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 41 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 920 ft / s ( 590 m / s ) to a distance of 3 @,@ 800 yards ( 3 @,@ 500 m ) . The gun 's rate of fire was approximately 96 – 98 rounds per minute . Only one mount was initially available , however , and it , along with its director , was fitted on the starboard side . Renown had her midships triple 4 @-@ inch mount removed to make room for an aircraft catapult that was not fitted until 1933 . The port Mark V 2 @-@ pounder mount was finally fitted , albeit without its director , that same year . The ship now carried a Fairey III floatplane for reconnaissance purposes . The flying @-@ off platform was also removed .

 After Repulse completed her 1926 refit she remained in commission , aside from a brief refit in July – September 1927 , with the BCS of the Atlantic Fleet until she was paid off in June 1932 prior to beginning her reconstruction in April 1933 . Most of the existing layers of high @-@ tensile steel that constituted the ship 's horizontal armour were replaced by non @-@ cemented armour plates 2 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 – 89 mm ) in thickness and the torpedo control tower was removed from the aft superstructure . A fixed catapult replaced the midships 4 @-@ inch triple mount and a hangar was built on each side of the rear funnel to house two of the ship 's Fairey III aircraft . One additional aircraft could be carried on the deck and another on the catapult itself . Electric cranes were mounted above each hangar to handle the aircraft . The four 4 @-@ inch AA guns were moved , one pair abreast the rear funnel at the level of the hangar roof and the other pair abreast the fore funnel on the forecastle deck . Four prototype QF 4 @-@ inch Mark XV dual @-@ purpose guns were added in twin @-@ gun Mark XVIII mounts abreast the mainmast . Two octuple Mark VI 2 @-@ pounder mounts were fitted on extensions of the conning @-@ tower platform abreast the fore funnel . Above these a pair of quadruple Mark II * mountings for the 0 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Vickers Mark III machine gun were added . These mounts could depress to − 10 ° and elevate to a maximum of 70 ° . The machine guns fired a 1 @.@ 326 @-@ ounce ( 37 @.@ 6 g ) bullet at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 520 ft / s ( 770 m / s ) . This gave the gun a maximum range of about 5 @,@ 000 yd ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) , although its effective range was only 800 yd ( 730 m ) Repulse received two HACS directors , one Mark II on the fore @-@ top and a Mark I * mounted on a pedestal above the rear superstructure . The two submerged torpedo tubes were removed and the vacant spaces sub @-@ divided and turned into store @-@ rooms . 
 Renown began her own even more thorough reconstruction in September 1936 , based on that of the battleship Warspite . Her superstructure and funnels were razed to the level of the upper deck , her masts taken out and the ship 's main and secondary armament was removed . A large splinter @-@ proof tower superstructure was built , topped with a director @-@ control tower for the main armament and two HACS Mark IV directors . The armoured hood formerly mounted above the conning tower was reinstalled on the rear superstructure . The ship 's engines and boilers were replaced by Parsons geared turbine sets and eight Admiralty three @-@ drum boilers . This saved some 2 @,@ 800 long tons ( 2 @,@ 800 t ) of weight and allowed the two forward boiler rooms to be converted to 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 110 mm ) magazines and other uses . Renown 's deck protection was somewhat upgraded by adding non @-@ cemented armour where it had not been added earlier and protecting the new 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch magazines . As in Repulse hangars were built abreast her rear funnel and a catapult was fitted between the rear funnel and the aft superstructure . 
 The ship 's 15 @-@ inch gun turrets were modified to the Mark I ( N ) standard with their elevation increased to 30 ° . Twenty dual @-@ purpose QF 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Mark III guns in twin BD Mark II mountings replaced all of the 4 @-@ inch guns . Six of the gun turrets , three on each side , were abreast the forward funnel while the remaining four were mounted on abreast the main mast . The BD Mark II mounts had elevation limits of − 5 ° to + 80 ° . The Mark III gun fired a 55 @-@ pound ( 25 kg ) high explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of about 2 @,@ 350 ft / s ( 720 m / s ) . Its rate of fire was 12 rounds per minute . They had a maximum effective ceiling of 41 @,@ 000 ft ( 12 @,@ 000 m ) . The guns were controlled by four dual @-@ purpose Mark IV directors , two mounted on the rear of the bridge structure and the remaining two on the aft superstructure . They fed tracking data to a HACS Mark IV analog computer for high @-@ angle targets and an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mark VII for low @-@ angle targets . Each gun was provided with 400 round of ammunition . Three octuple Mark VI 2 @-@ pounder mounts were fitted , two on a platform between the funnels and the third at the rear of the aft superstructure . Each was provided with a Mark III * director . Four quadruple Vickers .50 @-@ calibre Mark III mounts were also added , two each on the forward and rear superstructures . The submerged torpedo tubes were removed and eight above @-@ water torpedo tubes added . 
 Repulse was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet when she recommissioned in April 1936 . She transported 500 refugees from Palma , Majorca to Marseilles , France in late 1936 after the start of the Spanish Civil War . The ship was present at the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for George VI . Repulse was sent to Haifa in July 1938 to maintain order during the Arab Revolt . She was selected to convey the King and Queen during their May 1939 Canadian Tour and she was refitted between October 1938 and March 1939 for this role . The twin 4 @-@ inch AA guns were replaced by two more Mark V guns and two additional quadruple .50 @-@ calibre mounts were added . The King and Queen ultimately traveled aboard the liner RMS Empress of Australia while Repulse escorted them on the first half of the journey . 
 = = = Second World War = = = 
 The beginning of the Second World War found Repulse assigned to the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet . She patrolled off the Norwegian coast and in the North Sea in search of German ships and to enforce the blockade . Early in the war Repulse had her aft triple 4 @-@ inch mount replaced by an 8 @-@ barrel 2 @-@ pounder mount . In late October she was transferred to Halifax with the aircraft carrier Furious to protect convoys and search for German raiders . She escorted the convoy bringing most of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to Britain in mid @-@ December 1939 and was reassigned to the Home Fleet . The ship supported Allied operations during the Norwegian Campaign in April – June 1940 . Accompanied by Renown and the 1st Cruiser Squadron , Repulse attempted to intercept the German battleship Gneisenau as it sailed from Trondheim to Germany in July . Until May 1941 the ship escorted convoys and unsuccessfully searched for German ships . On 22 May Repulse was diverted from escorting Convoy <unk> to assist in the search for the German battleship Bismarck , but she had to break off the search early on 25 May as she was running low on fuel . The ship was refitted from June to August and received eight Oerlikon 20 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) autocannon as well as a Type 284 surface gunnery radar . Repulse escorted a troop convoy around the Cape of Good Hope from August to October and was transferred to East Indies Command . 
 To deter Japanese aggression in the Far East in late 1941 , Winston Churchill was determined to send a small group of fast capital ships , along with one modern aircraft carrier to Singapore . Repulse was already in the Indian Ocean and was ordered to Colombo in November to rendezvous with the battleship Prince of Wales where they would form Force Z. The carrier Indomitable was supposed to join them , but she was delayed when she ran aground while working up in the Caribbean . The two ships , and their escorting destroyers , arrived in Singapore on 2 December . Force Z departed on the evening of 8 December in an attempt to destroy Japanese troop convoys and protect the army 's seaward flanks from any Japanese landings in their rear . They were spotted by a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft during the following afternoon and shadowed for the rest of the day . Admiral Sir Tom Phillips decided to cancel the operation as the Japanese were now alerted . Force Z turned back during the evening , but was spotted again early on the morning of 10 December . About four hours later Japanese bombers arrived and attacked Repulse from high altitude ; she was slightly damaged by one bomb hit in her port hangar . The second wave consisted of torpedo bombers which missed Repulse , but scored at least one hit on Prince of Wales . The third wave again consisted of high @-@ altitude level bombers that missed Repulse entirely . The fourth wave of torpedo bombers managed to hit Repulse once amidships on her port side . The final wave of torpedo bombers hit Repulse with three more torpedoes and the ship capsized with the loss of 508 officers and men . The sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse contributed to the rapid fall of Singapore and Malaya to the Japanese , and demonstrated the dominance of air power over the capital ships that had been the backbone of naval power since the 1600s . 
 Renown was recommissioned on 28 August 1939 as part of the Home Fleet . Much like her sister , she spent September patrolling in the North Sea , but was transferred to Force K in the South Atlantic to help search for the " pocket battleship " Admiral Graf Spee . The ship joined Force H at the Cape of Good Hope in November to prevent Admiral Graf Spee from breaking into the South Atlantic . She was unsuccessful in this , but sank the blockade runner SS <unk> on 2 December . She remained in the South Atlantic even after Admiral Graf Spee was scuttled on 13 December and did not return to the Home Fleet until March 1940 . The ship became flagship of the Battlecruiser Squadron when Hood was paid off to refit that month . Renown also supported British forces during the Norwegian Campaign and briefly engaged the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau on 9 April . Renown opened fire first , but she was hit first by two 28 @-@ centimetre ( 11 in ) shells that only slightly damaged her . A few minutes later she hit Gneisenau with one 15 @-@ inch and two 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch shells that knocked out the main fire @-@ control director and damaged the rangefinder on " A " turret . The German ships were faster than Renown in the heavy weather and were able to successfully disengage . The ship was repaired from 20 April to 18 May and provided cover during the evacuation from Norway in early June . Renown was transferred to Force H at Gibraltar in August and relieved Hood as flagship . 
 In November 1940 Force H covered the small aircraft carrier Argus as she flew off Hurricane fighters bound for Malta from a position south of Sardinia . Later that month Force H participated in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento . Renown bombarded Genoa on 9 February 1941 with little effect . Renown and Force H escorted convoys both inside and outside the Mediterranean in March – May 1941 before being summoned into the Atlantic to search for the Bismarck . Force H escorted another convoy to Malta in July and Renown returned home for repairs the next month . The ship was transferred to the Home Fleet in November when her repairs were complete . She provided cover for the inbound and outbound convoys to the Soviet Union in early March 1942 . She became flagship of Force W which was formed to escort carriers carrying fighters to be flown @-@ off for Malta in April – May . 
 Renown rejoined Home Fleet once those missions were completed , but was transferred to Force H in October 1942 to participate in Operation Torch . She returned to Britain to refit from February to June 1943 . The ship brought Winston Churchill and his staff back from the Quebec Conference in September and conveyed them to the Cairo Conference in November . She rejoined the Home Fleet in December , just in time to be transferred to the Eastern Fleet a few weeks later . Renown arrived in Colombo at the end of January 1944 where she was flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron . In April she participated in Operation Cockpit , an airstrike against port and oil facilities on Sabang , off the island of Sumatra . The ship bombarded Japanese @-@ occupied facilities on Car Nicobar in the Nicobar Islands and Port Blair in the Andaman Islands on 30 April – 1 May . Renown supported the airstrike against Surabaya , Java ( Operation Transom ) on 17 May as well as follow @-@ on attack against Port Blair on 21 June . After another airstrike on 25 July on Sabang the ship bombarded the city . She bombarded facilities in the Nicobar Islands from 17 – 19 October . On 22 November Renown was replaced as flagship by Queen Elizabeth and the ship began a refit at Durban from December to February 1945 . She was recalled to home waters in March , lest the remaining German heavy ships make a final sortie , and reached Rosyth on 15 April . She was given a brief refit when this concern proved illusory and was placed in reserve in May 1945 . Renown was partially disarmed in July when six of her 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch turrets were removed , as well as all of her light guns . The ship hosted a meeting between King George VI and President Truman on 3 August when the latter was en route home aboard the heavy cruiser USS Augusta . The decision to dispose of the ship was announced on 21 January 1948 and she was towed to Faslane for scrapping on 3 August . 
 = I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings = 
 I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a 1969 autobiography about the early years of American writer and poet Maya Angelou . The first in a seven @-@ volume series , it is a coming @-@ of @-@ age story that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome racism and trauma . The book begins when three @-@ year @-@ old Maya and her older brother are sent to Stamps , Arkansas , to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16 . In the course of Caged Bird , Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an inferiority complex into a self @-@ possessed , dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice . 
 Angelou was challenged by her friend , author James Baldwin , and her editor , Robert Loomis , to write an autobiography that was also a piece of literature . Reviewers often categorize Caged Bird as autobiographical fiction because Angelou uses thematic development and other techniques common to fiction , but the prevailing critical view characterizes it as an autobiography , a genre she attempts to critique , change , and expand . The book covers topics common to autobiographies written by Black American women in the years following the Civil Rights Movement : a celebration of Black motherhood ; a critique of racism ; the importance of family ; and the quest for independence , personal dignity , and self @-@ definition . 
 Angelou uses her autobiography to explore subjects such as identity , rape , racism , and literacy . She also writes in new ways about women 's lives in a male @-@ dominated society . Maya , the younger version of Angelou and the book 's central character , has been called " a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America " . Angelou 's description of being raped as an eight @-@ year @-@ old child overwhelms the book , although it is presented briefly in the text . Rape is used as a metaphor for the suffering of her race . Another metaphor , that of a bird struggling to escape its cage , is a central image throughout the work , which consists of " a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression " . Angelou 's treatment of racism provides a thematic unity to the book . Literacy and the power of words help young Maya cope with her bewildering world ; books become her refuge as she works through her trauma . 
 Caged Bird was nominated for a National Book Award in 1970 and remained on The New York Times paperback bestseller list for two years . It has been used in educational settings from high schools to universities , and the book has been celebrated for creating new literary avenues for the American memoir . However , the book 's graphic depiction of childhood rape , racism , and sexuality has caused it to be challenged or banned in some schools and libraries . 
 = = Background = = 
 Before writing I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings at the age of forty , Angelou had a long and varied career , holding jobs such as composer , singer , actor , civil rights worker , journalist , and educator . In the late 1950s , she joined the Harlem Writers Guild , where she met a number of important African @-@ American authors , including her friend and mentor James Baldwin . After hearing civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. speak for the first time in 1960 , she was inspired to join the Civil Rights Movement . She organized several benefits for him , and he named her Northern Coordinator of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference . She worked for several years in Ghana , West Africa , as a journalist , actress , and educator . She was invited back to the US by Malcolm X to work for him shortly before his assassination in 1965 . In 1968 , King asked her to organize a march , but he too was assassinated on April 4 , which also happened to be her birthday . For many years , Angelou responded to King 's murder by not celebrating her birthday , choosing to meet with , call , or send flowers to his widow , Coretta Scott King . 
 Angelou was deeply depressed in the months following King 's assassination , so to help lift her spirits , Baldwin brought her to a dinner party at the home of cartoonist Jules Feiffer and his wife Judy in late 1968 . The guests began telling stories of their childhoods and Angelou 's stories impressed Judy Feiffer . The next day she called Robert Loomis at Random House , who became Angelou 's editor throughout her long writing career until he retired in 2011 , and " told him that he ought to get this woman to write a book " . At first , Angelou refused , since she thought of herself as a poet and playwright . According to Angelou , Baldwin had a " covert hand " in getting her to write the book , and advised Loomis to use " a little reverse psychology " , and reported that Loomis tricked her into it by daring her : " It 's just as well " , he said , " because to write an autobiography as literature is just about impossible " . Angelou was unable to resist a challenge , and she began writing Caged Bird . After " <unk> herself " in London , it took her two years to write it . She shared the manuscript with her friend , writer Jessica Mitford , before submitting it for publication . 
 Angelou subsequently wrote six additional autobiographies , covering a variety of her young adult experiences . They are distinct in style and narration , but unified in their themes and stretch from Arkansas to Africa , and back to the US , from the beginnings of World War II to King 's assassination . Like Caged Bird , the events in these books are episodic and crafted as a series of short stories , yet do not follow a strict chronology . Later books in the series include Gather Together in My Name ( 1974 ) , Singin ' and Swingin ' and Gettin ' Merry Like Christmas ( 1976 ) , The Heart of a Woman ( 1981 ) , All God 's Children Need Traveling Shoes ( 1986 ) , A Song Flung Up to Heaven ( 2002 ) , and Mom & Me & Mom ( 2013 , at the age of 85 ) . Critics have often judged Angelou 's later autobiographies " in light of the first " , and Caged Bird generally receives the highest praise . 
 Beginning with Caged Bird , Angelou used the same " writing ritual " for many years . She would get up at five in the morning and check into a hotel room , where the staff were instructed to remove any pictures from the walls . She wrote on yellow legal pads while lying on the bed , with a bottle of sherry , a deck of cards to play solitaire , Roget 's Thesaurus , and the Bible , and left by the early afternoon . She averaged 10 – 12 pages of material a day , which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening . Lupton stated that this ritual indicated " a firmness of purpose and an inflexible use of time " . Angelou went through this process to give herself time to turn the events of her life into art , and to " enchant " herself ; as she said in a 1989 interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation , to " relive the agony , the anguish , the Sturm und Drang " . She placed herself back in the time she wrote about , even during traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird , to " tell the human truth " about her life . Critic Opal Moore says about Caged Bird : " ... Though easily read , [ it ] is no ' easy read ' " . Angelou stated that she played cards to reach that place of enchantment , to access her memories more effectively . She has stated , " It may take an hour to get into it , but once I 'm in it — ha ! It 's so delicious ! " She did not find the process cathartic ; rather , she found relief in " telling the truth " . 
 = = = Title = = = 
 When selecting a title , Angelou turned to Paul Laurence Dunbar , an African @-@ American poet whose works she had admired for years . Jazz vocalist and civil rights activist Abbey Lincoln suggested the title . According to Lyman B. Hagen , the title pulls Angelou 's readers into the book while reminding them that it is possible to both lose control of one 's life and to have one 's freedom taken from them . Angelou has credited Dunbar , along with Shakespeare , with forming her " writing ambition " . The title of the book comes from the third stanza of Dunbar 's poem " Sympathy " : 
 I know why the caged bird sings , ah me , 
 When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore , 
 When he beats his bars and would be free ; 
 It is not a carol of joy or glee , 
 But a prayer that he sends from his heart 's deep core , 
 But a plea , that upward to Heaven he flings – 
 I know why the caged bird sings .

 I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings follows Marguerite 's ( called " My " or " Maya " by her brother ) life from the age of three to 17 and the struggles she faces – particularly with racism – in the Southern United States . Abandoned by their parents , Maya and her older brother Bailey are sent to live with their paternal grandmother ( Momma ) and crippled uncle ( Uncle Willie ) in Stamps , Arkansas . Maya and Bailey are haunted by their parents ' abandonment throughout the book – they travel alone and are labeled like baggage . 
 Many of the problems Maya encounters in her childhood stem from the overt racism of her white neighbors . Although Momma is relatively wealthy because she owns the general store at the heart of Stamps ' Black community , the white children of their town hassle Maya 's family relentlessly . One of these " powhitetrash " girls , for example , reveals her pubic hair to Momma in a humiliating incident . Early in the book , Momma hides Uncle Willie in a vegetable bin to protect him from Ku Klux Klan raiders . Maya has to endure the insult of her name being changed to Mary by a racist employer . A white speaker at her eighth grade graduation ceremony disparages the Black audience by suggesting that they have limited job opportunities . A white dentist refuses to treat Maya 's rotting tooth , even when Momma reminds him that she had loaned him money during the Depression . The Black community of Stamps enjoys a moment of racial victory when they listen to the radio broadcast of Joe Louis 's championship fight , but generally they feel the heavy weight of racist oppression . 
 A turning point in the book occurs when Maya and Bailey 's father unexpectedly appears in Stamps . He takes the two children with him when he departs , but leaves them with their mother in St. Louis , Missouri . Eight @-@ year @-@ old Maya is sexually abused and raped by her mother 's boyfriend , Mr. Freeman . He is found guilty during the trial , but escapes jail time and is murdered , presumably by Maya 's uncles . Maya feels guilty and withdraws from everyone but her brother . Even after returning to Stamps , Maya remains reclusive and nearly mute until she meets Mrs. Bertha Flowers , " the aristocrat of Black Stamps " , who encourages her through books and communication to regain her voice and soul . This coaxes Maya out of her shell . 
 Later , Momma decides to send her grandchildren to their mother in San Francisco , California , to protect them from the dangers of racism in Stamps . Maya attends George Washington High School and studies dance and drama on a scholarship at the California Labor School . Before graduating , she becomes the first Black female streetcar conductor in San Francisco . While still in high school , Maya visits her father in southern California one summer , and has some experiences pivotal to her development . She drives a car for the first time when she must transport her intoxicated father home from an excursion to Mexico . She experiences homelessness for a short time after a fight with her father 's girlfriend . 
 During Maya 's final year of high school , she worries that she might be a lesbian ( which she equates with being a hermaphrodite ) , and initiates sexual intercourse with a teenage boy . She becomes pregnant , which on the advice of her brother , she hides from her family until her eighth month of pregnancy in order to graduate from high school . Maya gives birth at the end of the book .

 Angelou 's prose works , while presenting a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form , can be placed in the long tradition of African @-@ American autobiography . Her use of fiction @-@ writing techniques such as dialogue , characterization , and thematic development , however , often lead reviewers to categorize her books , including I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , as autobiographical fiction . Other critics , like Lupton , insist that Angelou 's books should be categorized as autobiographies because they conform to the genre 's standard structure : they are written by a single author , they are chronological , and they contain elements of character , technique , and theme . In a 1983 interview with African @-@ American literature critic Claudia Tate , Angelou calls her books autobiographies . 
 At first , Angelou intended to return to poetry and play @-@ writing after completing Caged Bird and write no more autobiographies , but she chose the genre as her primary mode of expression because of its challenge and so that she could " change it , to make it bigger , richer , finer , and more inclusive in the twentieth century " . In a 1989 interview , she stated , " I think I am the only serious writer who has chosen the autobiographical form to carry my work , my expression " . As she told journalist George Plimpton during a 1990 interview , " Autobiography is awfully seductive ; it ’ s wonderful " . She also told Plimpton that like the tradition begun by Frederick Douglass in slave narratives , she used the literary technique of " speaking in the first @-@ person singular talking about the first @-@ person plural , always saying I meaning ' we ' " . As critic Susan Gilbert states , Angelou was reporting not one person 's story , but the collective 's . Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agrees , and sees Angelou as representative of the convention in African @-@ American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people . 
 Scholar Joanne M. Braxton sees Caged Bird as " the fully developed black female autobiographical form that began to emerge in the 1940s and 1950s " . The book presents themes that are common in autobiography by Black American women : a celebration of Black motherhood ; a criticism of racism ; the importance of family ; and the quest for independence , personal dignity , and self @-@ definition . Angelou introduces a unique point of view in American autobiography by revealing her life story through a narrator who is a Black female from the South , at some points a child , and other points a mother . Writer Hilton Als calls Angelou one of the " pioneers of self @-@ exposure " , willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices . For example , Angelou was worried about her readers ' reactions to her disclosure in her second autobiography , Gather Together in My Name , that she was a prostitute . She went through with it , anyway , after her husband Paul Du Feu advised her to be honest about it . 
 Angelou has recognized that there are fictional aspects to her books , and that she tends to " diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth " . Angelou discussed her writing process with Plimpton , and when asked if she changed the truth to improve her story , she admitted that she had . She stated , " Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people , because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about . " Although Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories , she has used these facts to make an impact with the reader . As Hagen states , " One can assume that ' the essence of the data ' is present in Angelou 's work " . Hagen also states that Angelou " fictionalizes , to enhance interest " . For example , Angelou uses the first @-@ person narrative voice customary with autobiographies , told from the perspective of a child that is " artfully recreated by an adult narrator " . 
 Angelou uses two distinct voices , the adult writer and the child who is the focus of the book , whom Angelou calls " the Maya character " . Angelou reports that maintaining the distinction between herself and the Maya character is " damned difficult " , but " very necessary " . Scholar Liliane Arensberg suggests that Angelou " retaliates for the tongue @-@ tied child 's helpless pain " by using her adult self 's irony and wit . As such , Caged Bird has been called a Bildungsroman or coming @-@ of @-@ age story ; critic Mary Jane Lupton compares it to other <unk> like George Eliot 's novel The Mill on the Floss . According to Lupton , the two books share the following similarities : a focus on young strong @-@ willed heroines who have solid relationships with their brothers , an examination of the role of literature in life , and an emphasis on the importance of family and community life .

 When Angelou wrote I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings at the end of the 1960s , one of the necessary and accepted features of literature , according to critic Pierre A. Walker , was thematic unity . One of Angelou 's goals was to create a book that satisfied this criterion , in order to achieve her political purposes , which were to demonstrate how to resist racism in America . The structure of the text , which resembles a series of short stories , is not chronological but rather thematic . Walker , in his 1993 article about Caged Bird , " Racial Protest , Identity , Words , and Form " , focuses on the book 's structure , and describes how it supports her presentation of racism . According to Walker , critics had neglected analyzing its structure , choosing to focus instead on its themes , which he feels neglects the political nature of the book . He states , " One serves Angelou and Caged Bird better by emphasizing how form and political content work together " . Angelou structures her book so that it presents a series of lessons about how to resist racism and oppression . The progression Maya goes through thematically unifies the book , something that " stands in contrast to the otherwise episodic quality of the narrative " . The way in which Angelou constructs , arranges , and organizes her vignettes often undermined the chronology of her childhood by " juxtaposing the events of one chapter with the events of preceding and following ones so that they too comment on each other " . 
 For example , the incident with the " powhitetrash " girls takes place in chapter 5 , when Maya was ten years old , well before Angelou 's recounting of her rape in chapter 12 , which occurred when Maya was 8 . Walker explains that Angelou 's purpose in placing the vignettes in this way is that it followed her thematic structure . Angelou 's editor , Robert Loomis , agrees , stating that Angelou could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader . Hagen sees Angelou 's structure somewhat differently , focusing on Maya 's journey " to establish a worthwhile self @-@ concept " , and states that she structures the book into three parts : arrival , sojourn , and departure , which occur both geographically and psychologically . However , Hagen notes that instead of beginning Caged Bird chronologically , with Maya and Bailey 's arrival in Stamps , Angelou begins the book much later chronologically by recounting an embarrassing experience at church , an incident that demonstrates Maya 's diminished sense of self , insecurity , and lack of status . Hagen explains that Angelou 's purpose is to demonstrate Maya 's journey from insecurity to her feelings of worth gained by becoming a mother at the end of the book . 
 = = Themes = = 
 = = = Identity = = = 
 In the course of Caged Bird , Maya , who has been described as " a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America " , goes from being a victim of racism with an inferiority complex to a self @-@ aware individual who responds to racism with dignity and a strong sense of her own identity . Feminist scholar Maria Lauret states that the " formation of female cultural identity " is woven into the book 's narrative , setting Maya up as " a role model for Black women " . Scholar Liliane Arensberg calls this presentation Angelou 's " identity theme " and a major motif in Angelou 's narrative . Maya 's unsettled life in Caged Bird suggests her sense of self " as perpetually in the process of becoming , of dying and being reborn , in all its ramifications " . African @-@ American literature scholar Dolly McPherson agrees , stating that Angelou creatively uses Christian mythology and theology to present the Biblical themes of death , regeneration , and rebirth . 
 As Lauret indicates , Angelou and other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s used autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women 's lives and identities in a male @-@ dominated society . Up until this time , Black women were not depicted realistically in African @-@ American fiction and autobiography , meaning that Angelou was one of the first Black autobiographers to present , as Cudjoe put it , " a powerful and authentic signification of [ African @-@ American ] womanhood in her quest for understanding and love rather than for bitterness and despair " . Lauret sees a connection between Angelou 's autobiographies , which Lauret calls " fictions of subjectivity " and " feminist first @-@ person narratives " , and fictional first @-@ person narratives ( such as The Women 's Room by Marilyn French and The Golden Notebook by Doris Lessing ) written during the same period . As French and Lessing do in their novels , Angelou employs the narrator as protagonist and depends upon " the illusion of presence in their mode of signification " . 
 As a displaced girl , Maya 's pain is worsened by an awareness of her displacement . She is " the forgotten child " , and must come to terms with " the unimaginable reality " of being unloved and unwanted ; she lives in a hostile world that defines beauty in terms of whiteness and that rejects her simply because she is a Black girl . Maya <unk> the rejection she has experienced – her belief in her own ugliness was " absolute " . McPherson believes that the concept of family , or what she calls " kinship concerns " , in Angelou 's books must be understood in the light of the children 's displacement at the beginning of Caged Bird . Being sent away from their parents was a psychological rejection , and resulted in a quest for love , acceptance , and self @-@ worth for both Maya and Bailey . 
 Angelou uses her many roles , incarnations , and identities throughout her books to illustrate how oppression and personal history are interrelated . For example , in Caged Bird , Angelou demonstrates the " racist habit " of renaming African Americans , as shown when her white employer insists on calling her " Mary " . Angelou describes the employer 's renaming as the " hellish horror of being ' called out of [ one 's ] name ' " . Scholar Debra Walker King calls it a racist insult and an assault against Maya 's race and self @-@ image . The renaming emphasizes Maya 's feelings of inadequacy and denigrates her identity , individuality , and uniqueness . Maya understands that she is being insulted and rebels by breaking Mrs. Cullinan 's favorite dish , but feels vindicated when , as she leaves her employer 's home , Mrs. Cullinan finally gets her name right . Another incident in the book that solidifies Maya 's identity is her trip to Mexico with her father , when she has to drive a car for the first time . Contrasted with her experience in Stamps , Maya is finally " in control of her fate " . This experience is central to Maya 's growth , as is the incident that immediately follows it , her short period of homelessness after arguing with her father 's girlfriend . These two incidents give Maya a knowledge of self @-@ determination and confirm her self @-@ worth . 
 Scholar Mary Burgher believes that female Black autobiographers like Angelou have debunked the stereotypes of African @-@ American mothers as " breeder [ s ] and matriarch [ s ] " , and have presented them as having " a creative and personally fulfilling role " . Lupton believes that Angelou 's plot construction and character development were influenced by the same mother / child motif as is found in the work of Harlem Renaissance poet Jessie Fauset . For the first five years of her life , Maya thinks of herself as an orphan and finds comfort in the thought that her mother is dead . Maya 's feelings for and relationship with her own mother , whom she blames for her abandonment , express themselves in ambivalence and " repressed violent aggression " . For example , Maya and her brother destroy the first Christmas gifts sent by their mother . These strong feelings are not resolved until the end of the book , when Maya becomes a mother herself , and her mother finally becomes the nurturing presence for which Maya has longed . The two main maternal influences on Maya 's life change as well ; Vivian becomes a more active participant , while Momma becomes less effective as Maya , by becoming a mother herself , moves from childhood to adulthood . 
 = = = Racism = = = 
 Stamps , Arkansas , as depicted in Caged Bird , has very little " social ambiguity " : it is a racist world divided between Black and white , male and female . Als characterizes the division as " good and evil " , and notes how Angelou 's witness of the evil in her society , which was directed at Black women , shaped Angelou 's young life and informed her views into adulthood . Angelou uses the metaphor of a bird struggling to escape its cage , described in Paul Laurence Dunbar 's poem , as a prominent symbol throughout her series of autobiographies . Like elements within a prison narrative , the caged bird represents Angelou 's confinement resulting from racism and oppression . The caged bird metaphor also invokes the " supposed contradiction of the bird singing in the midst of its struggle " . Scholar <unk> B. Kelley calls Caged Bird a " gentle indictment of white American womanhood " ; Hagen expands it further , stating that the book is " a dismaying story of white dominance " . 
 Caged Bird has been called " perhaps the most aesthetically satisfying autobiography written in the years immediately following the Civil Rights era " . Critic Pierre A. Walker expresses a similar sentiment , and places it in the African @-@ American literature tradition of political protest . Angelou demonstrates , through her involvement with the Black community of Stamps , as well as her presentation of vivid and realistic racist characters and " the vulgarity of white Southern attitudes toward African Americans " , her developing understanding of the rules for surviving in a racist society . Angelou 's autobiographies , beginning with Caged Bird , contain a sequence of lessons about resisting oppression . The sequence she describes leads Angelou , as the protagonist , from " helpless rage and indignation to forms of subtle resistance , and finally to outright and active protest " . 
 Walker insists that Angelou 's treatment of racism is what gives her autobiographies their thematic unity and underscores one of their central themes : the injustice of racism and how to fight it . For example , in Angelou 's depiction of the " powhitetrash " incident , Maya reacts with rage , indignation , humiliation , and helplessness , but Momma teaches her how they can maintain their personal dignity and pride while dealing with racism , and that it is an effective basis for actively protesting and combating racism . Walker calls Momma 's way a " strategy of subtle resistance " and McPherson calls it " the dignified course of silent endurance " . 
 Angelou portrays Momma as a realist whose patience , courage , and silence ensured the survival and success of those who came after her . For example , Maya responds assertively when subjected to demeaning treatment by Mrs. Cullinan , her white employer , and , later on in the book , breaks the race barrier to become the first black streetcar operator in San Francisco . In addition , Angelou 's description of the strong and cohesive black community of Stamps demonstrates how African Americans subvert repressive institutions to withstand racism . Arensberg insists that Angelou demonstrates how she , as a Black child , evolves out of her " racial hatred " , common in the works of many contemporary Black novelists and autobiographers . At first Maya wishes that she could become white , since growing up Black in white America is dangerous ; later she sheds her self @-@ loathing and embraces a strong racial identity . 
 = = = Rape = = = 
 Angelou 's description of being raped as an eight @-@ year @-@ old child overwhelms the autobiography , although it is presented briefly in the text . Scholar Mary Vermillion compares Angelou 's treatment of rape to that of Harriet Jacobs in her autobiography Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl . Jacobs and Angelou both use rape as a metaphor for the suffering of African Americans ; Jacobs uses the metaphor to critique slaveholding culture , while Angelou uses it to first internalize , then challenge , twentieth @-@ century racist conceptions of the Black female body ( namely , that the Black female is physically unattractive ) . Rape , according to Vermillion , " represents the black girl 's difficulties in controlling , understanding , and respecting both her body and her words " . 
 Arensberg notes that Maya 's rape is connected to the theme of death in Caged Bird , as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya 's brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape . After Maya lies during Freeman 's trial , stating that the rape was the first time he touched her inappropriately , Freeman is murdered ( presumably by one of Maya 's uncles ) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death . As a result , she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey . Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self @-@ imposed , five @-@ year @-@ long silence . As Angelou later stated , " I thought if I spoke , my mouth would just issue out something that would kill people , randomly , so it was better not to talk " . 
 African @-@ American literature scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe calls Angelou 's depiction of the rape " a burden " of Caged Bird : a demonstration of " the manner in which the Black female is violated in her tender years and ... the ' unnecessary insult ' of Southern girlhood in her movement to adolescence " . Vermillion goes further , maintaining that a Black woman who writes about her rape risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about her race and gender . When asked decades later how she was able to survive such trauma , Angelou explained it by stating , " I can 't remember a time when I wasn 't loved by somebody . " When asked by the same interviewer why she wrote about the experience , she indicated that she wanted to demonstrate the complexities of rape . She also wanted to prevent it from happening to someone else , so that anyone who had been raped might gain understanding and not blame herself for it . 
 = = = Literacy = = = 
 As Lupton points out , all of Angelou 's autobiographies , especially Caged Bird and its immediate sequel Gather Together in My Name , are " very much concerned with what [ Angelou ] knew and how she learned it " . Lupton compares Angelou 's informal education with the education of other Black writers of the twentieth century , who did not earn official degrees and depended upon the " direct instruction of African American cultural forms " . Angelou 's quest for learning and literacy parallels " the central myth of black culture in America " : that freedom and literacy are connected . Angelou is influenced by writers introduced to her by Mrs. Flowers during her self @-@ imposed muteness , including Edgar Allan Poe and William Shakespeare . Angelou states , early in Caged Bird , that she , as the Maya character , " met and fell in love with William Shakespeare " . Critic Mary Vermillion sees a connection between Maya 's rape and Shakespeare 's " The Rape of Lucrece " , which Maya memorizes and recites when she regains her speech . Vermillion maintains that Maya finds comfort in the poem 's identification with suffering . Maya finds novels and their characters complete and meaningful , so she uses them to make sense of her bewildering world . She is so involved in her fantasy world of books that she even uses them as a way to cope with her rape , writing in Caged Bird , " ... I was sure that any minute my mother or Bailey or the Green Hornet would bust in the door and save me " . 
 According to Walker , the power of words is another theme that appears repeatedly in Caged Bird . For example , Maya chooses to not speak after her rape because she is afraid of the destructive power of words . Mrs. Flowers , by introducing her to classic literature and poetry , teaches her about the positive power of language and empowers Maya to speak again . The importance of both the spoken and written word also appears repeatedly in Caged Bird and in all of Angelou 's autobiographies . Referring to the importance of literacy and methods of effective writing , Angelou once advised Oprah Winfrey in an 1993 interview to " do as West Africans do ... listen to the deep talk " , or the " utterances existing beneath the obvious " . McPherson says , " If there is one stable element in Angelou 's youth it is [ a ] dependence upon books " . The public library is a " quiet refuge " to which Maya retreats when she experiences crisis . Hagen describes Angelou as a " natural story @-@ teller " , which " reflect [ s ] a good listener with a rich oral heritage " . Hagen also insists that Angelou 's years of muteness provided her with this skill . 
 Angelou was also powerfully affected by slave narratives , spirituals , poetry , and other autobiographies . Angelou read through the Bible twice as a young child , and memorized many passages from it . African @-@ American spirituality , as represented by Angelou 's grandmother , has influenced all of Angelou 's writings , in the activities of the church community she first experiences in Stamps , in the sermonizing , and in scripture . Hagen goes on to say that in addition to being influenced by rich literary form , Angelou has also been influenced by oral traditions . In Caged Bird , Mrs. Flowers encourages her to listen carefully to " Mother Wit " , which Hagen defines as the collective wisdom of the African @-@ American community as expressed in folklore and humor . 
 Angelou 's humor in Caged Bird and in all her autobiographies is drawn from Black folklore and is used to demonstrate that in spite of severe racism and oppression , Black people thrive and are , as Hagen states , " a community of song and laughter and courage " . Hagen states that Angelou is able to make an indictment of institutionalized racism as she laughs at her flaws and the flaws of her community and " balances stories of black endurance of oppression against white myths and misperceptions " . Hagen also characterize Caged Bird as a " blues genre autobiography " because it uses elements of blues music . These elements include the act of testimony when speaking of one 's life and struggles , ironic understatement , and the use of natural metaphors , rhythms , and intonations . Hagen also sees elements of African American sermonizing in Caged Bird . Angelou 's use of African @-@ American oral traditions creates a sense of community in her readers , and identifies those who belong to it .

 I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is the most highly acclaimed of Angelou 's autobiographies . The other volumes in her series of seven autobiographies are judged and compared to Caged Bird . It became a bestseller immediately after it was published . Angelou 's friend and mentor , James Baldwin , maintained that her book " liberates the reader into life " and called it " a Biblical study of life in the midst of death " . According to Angelou 's biographers , " Readers , especially women , and in particular Black women , took the book to heart " . 
 By the end of 1969 , critics had placed Angelou in the tradition of other Black autobiographers . Poet [ [ James <unk> ] ] asserts that Caged Bird " is one of the essential books produced by our culture " . He insists that " [ w ] e should all read it , especially our children " . It was nominated for a National Book Award in 1970 , has never been out of print , and has been published in many languages . It has been a Book of the Month Club selection and an Ebony Book Club selection . In 2011 , Time Magazine placed the book in its list of 100 best and most influential books written in English since 1923 . 
 Critic Robert A. Gross called Caged Bird " a tour de force of language " . Edmund Fuller insisted that Angelou 's intellectual range and artistry were apparent in how she told her story . Caged Bird catapulted Angelou to international fame and critical acclaim , was a significant development in Black women 's literature in that it " heralded the success of other now prominent writers " . Other reviewers have praised Angelou 's use of language in the book , including critic E. M. Guiney , who reported that Caged Bird was " one of the best autobiographies of its kind that I have read " . Critic R. A. Gross praised Angelou for her use of rich and dazzling images . 
 By the mid @-@ 1980s , Caged Bird had gone through 20 hardback printings and 32 paperback printings . The week after Angelou recited her poem " On the Pulse of Morning " at President Bill Clinton 's 1993 inauguration , sales of the paperback version of Caged Bird and her other works rose by 300 – 600 percent . Caged Bird had sold steadily since its publication , but it increased by 500 percent . The 16 @-@ page publication of " On the Pulse of Morning " became a best @-@ seller , and the recording of the poem was awarded a Grammy Award . The Bantam Books edition of Caged Bird was a bestseller for 36 weeks , and they had to reprint 400 @,@ 000 copies of her books to meet demand . Random House , which published Angelou 's hardcover books and the poem later that year , reported that they sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992 , marking a 1 @,@ 200 percent increase . 
 The book 's reception has not been universally positive ; for example , author Francine Prose considers its inclusion in the high school curriculum as partly responsible for the " dumbing down " of American society . Prose calls the book " manipulative melodrama " , and considers Angelou 's writing style an inferior example of poetic prose in memoir . She accuses Angelou of combining a dozen metaphors in one paragraph and for " obscuring ideas that could be expressed so much more simply and felicitously " . Many parents throughout the U.S. have sought to ban the book from schools and libraries for being inappropriate for younger high school students , for promoting premarital sex , homosexuality , cohabitation , and pornography , and for not supporting traditional values . Parents have also objected to the book 's use of profanity and to its graphic and violent depiction of rape and racism . 
 = = = Influence = = = 
 When Caged Bird was published in 1969 , Angelou was hailed as a new kind of memoirist , one of the first African @-@ American women who was able to publicly discuss her personal life . Up to that point , Black women writers were marginalized to the point that they were unable to present themselves as central characters . Writer Julian Mayfield , who called Caged Bird " a work of art that eludes description " , has insisted that Angelou 's autobiographies set a precedent for African @-@ American autobiography as a whole . Als insisted that Caged Bird marked one of the first times that a Black autobiographer could , as Als put it , " write about blackness from the inside , without apology or defense " . Through the writing of her autobiography , Angelou became recognized as a respected spokesperson for blacks and women . Caged Bird made her " without a doubt ... America 's most visible black woman autobiographer " . Although Als considers Caged Bird an important contribution to the increase of Black feminist writings in the 1970s , he attributes its success less to its originality than to " its resonance in the prevailing Zeitgeist " of its time , at the end of the American Civil Rights movement . Angelou 's writings , more interested in self @-@ revelation than in politics or feminism , freed many other women writers to " open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world " . 
 Angelou 's autobiographies , especially the first volume , have been used in narrative and multicultural approaches to teacher education . Jocelyn A. Glazier , a professor at George Washington University , has used Caged Bird and Gather Together in My Name when training teachers to appropriately explore racism in their classrooms . Angelou 's use of understatement , self @-@ mockery , humor , and irony causes readers of Angelou 's autobiographies to wonder what she " left out " and to be unsure how to respond to the events Angelou describes . These techniques force white readers to explore their feelings about race and their privileged status in society . Glazier found that although critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the genre of African @-@ American autobiography and her literary techniques , readers react to her storytelling with " surprise , particularly when [ they ] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography " . 
 Educator Daniel Challener , in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood , analyzed the events in Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children . Challener states that Angelou 's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did . Psychologist Chris <unk> has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self @-@ concept and self @-@ esteem , ego resilience , industry versus inferiority , effects of abuse , parenting styles , sibling and friendship relations , gender issues , cognitive development , puberty , and identity formation in adolescence . He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real @-@ life examples of these psychological concepts . 
 = = = Censorship = = = 
 Caged Bird has been criticized by many parents , causing it to be removed from school curricula and library shelves . The book was approved to be taught in public schools and was placed in public school libraries through the U.S. in the early 1980s , and was included in advanced placement and gifted student curricula , but attempts by parents to censor it began in 1983 . It has been challenged in 15 U.S. states . Educators have responded to these challenges by removing it from reading lists and libraries , by providing students with alternatives , and by requiring parental permission from students . Some have been critical of its sexually explicit scenes , use of language , and irreverent religious depictions . 
 Caged Bird appeared third on the American Library Association ( ALA ) list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990 – 2000 , sixth on the ALA 's 2000 – 2009 list , and one of the ten books most frequently banned from high school and junior high school libraries and classrooms .

 A made @-@ for @-@ TV movie version of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings was filmed in Mississippi and aired on April 28 , 1979 on CBS . Angelou and Leonora <unk> wrote the screenplay ; the movie was directed by Fielder Cook . Constance Good played young Maya . Also appearing were actors Esther Rolle , Roger E. Mosley , Diahann Carroll , Ruby Dee , and Madge Sinclair . Two scenes in the movie differed from events described in the book . Angelou added a scene between Maya and Uncle Willie after the Joe Louis fight ; in it , he expresses his feelings of redemption and hope after Louis defeats a white opponent . Angelou also presents her eighth grade graduation differently in the film . In the book , Henry Reed delivers the valedictory speech and leads the Black audience in the Negro national anthem . In the movie , Maya conducts these activities . 
 = One Meridian Plaza = 
 One Meridian Plaza was a 38 @-@ story high @-@ rise office building in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , United States . The 492 feet ( 150 m ) tower was designed by Vincent Kling & Associates and completed in 1972 . The building was demolished in 1999 as a result of damage of a fire that began on February 23 , 1991 . The fire began on the 22nd floor after linseed oil soaked rags ignited a blaze that raged out of control for hours . Philadelphia firefighters fought the blaze , but struggled due to a lack of power in the skyscraper and insufficient water pressure from the building 's standpipes . Three firefighters died in the twelve alarm fire after becoming disoriented by heavy smoke . Firefighting efforts inside One Meridian Plaza eventually were abandoned due to fears the structure would collapse . The fire was only brought under control once it reached the 30th floor which was one of the few floors that had automatic sprinklers installed . Ten sprinklers held back the fire until it started burning itself out and was finally brought under control almost a full day after it started . The blaze seriously damaged the building destroying eight floors and damaged neighboring buildings . 
 For eight years after the fire , One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged right in the center of Philadelphia 's business district . The building was caught in litigation between the owners and the insurance company over how much the insurers would pay the owners and how repairs or demolition would proceed . Businesses near the empty high @-@ rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners to do something with the building . After lawsuits were settled , the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998 . At the time of its demolition in 1999 , One Meridian Plaza was the third @-@ tallest destroyed building in the world . 
 = = Building = = 
 One Meridian Plaza was a 38 @-@ story high @-@ rise office building designed by Vincent Kling & Associates . Construction on the 492 feet ( 150 m ) tower began in 1968 , was completed in 1972 and approved for occupancy in 1973 . Built at the corner of 15th Street and South Penn Square in Center City , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , the US $ 40 million high @-@ rise was built adjacent to the Girard Trust Building , now the Ritz @-@ Carlton Philadelphia , and the front faced Philadelphia City Hall across the street . The rectangular One Meridian Plaza was 243 feet ( 74 m ) long and 92 feet ( 28 m ) wide and contained 756 @,@ 000 square feet ( 70 @,@ 000 m2 ) . Of the 38 floors , 36 were occupiable and 2 were mechanical floors . The structure also had 3 underground levels . The building 's structure was composed of steel and concrete and the facade was a granite curtain wall . There were two <unk> on the roof . One Meridian Plaza 's eastern stairwell connected the building to the adjacent Girard Trust Building . At one point there were plans to build a structure on the south side of One Meridian Plaza that would share one of the elevator banks in the high @-@ rise , but nothing came of the plans mainly due to neither site having the same owner . On the northwest corner of the property is a bronze sculpture called " Triune . " Designed by Robert <unk> the abstract sculpture was not damaged in the 1991 fire and is still there . 
 When One Meridian Plaza was built Philadelphia was enforcing a building code from 1949 that made no distinction between high @-@ rises and other buildings . In 1984 Philadelphia adopted new codes that required automatic sprinkler systems in all new buildings . At the time of construction , sprinklers were only built on the service levels below ground . In 1988 plans were put in place to have automatic sprinklers placed throughout the building by November 1993 . By 1991 four floors were completely protected by sprinklers and in part on three other floors . The sprinklers had been installed during floor renovations at the request of tenants and the building 's owners had plans to install more as other floors were renovated . 
 The high @-@ rise was originally known as the Fidelity Mutual Life Building , named for Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Co. who developed the building in a joint venture with Girard Bank . The high @-@ rise was the tallest building built in Philadelphia since the early 1930s . Girard Bank sold its share of the property , which was also known as Three Girard Plaza , to Fidelity Mutual Life in 1982 . Fidelity Mutual Life , which had moved its offices out of the building to Radnor Township , Pennsylvania earlier that year , subsequently sold the building to E / R Partners in 1983 . A joint venture of the Rubin Organization and Equitable Life Assurance Company of America , E / R Partners bought the property for US $ 143 million . In 1989 a Dutch pension fund , Algemeen <unk> <unk> , paid US $ 120 million to enter E / R Partners with a sixty @-@ five percent stake in the building . In 1984 Three Girard Plaza became the Three Mellon Bank Center after Girard Bank was bought by Mellon Bank , and in 1990 was renamed again to One Meridian Plaza after Meridian Bank replaced Mellon Bank as the lead tenant . Another major tenant was Comcast , who made 81 @,@ 000 square feet ( 7 @,@ 500 m2 ) of One Meridian Plaza its corporate headquarters in 1989 .

 On February 23 , 1991 , at about 8 : 23 PM , a fire began on the 22nd floor of the building . It was a Saturday night and there were only three people in the building at the time , an engineer and two security guards . Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor . The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags which then set fire to other solvents nearby . Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor and by the time the fire alarm went off the fire was already well established . After the fire alarm sounded in the building the engineer went up to the 22nd floor to investigate . When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat which prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby . The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire safety controls there . The second security guard was on the 30th floor when the alarm went off and used the stairwell to get to the ground floor . 
 The lobby guard returned a call to the alarm monitoring service which had called when the alarm initially went off to confirm that there was a fire , but never called the Philadelphia Fire Department . The first call came from someone on the street who saw smoke coming from the building . During the first 911 call , at about 8 : 27 PM , the alarm company alerted the fire department to the fire . Engine 43 was the first firefighting unit to arrive at the scene and reported seeing heavy smoke and flames in one of the windows . As firefighters started fighting the fire it had grown with flames breaking through windows and lapping up the side of the building . 
 = = = Problems = = = 
 Firefighters began experiencing problems before they even reached the fire . By the time firefighters reached the 11th floor the building had lost power after the heat from the blaze damaged electrical cables . The emergency generator never began producing electricity , and despite efforts to restore power the building was without electricity for the entirety of the event . This forced firefighters to work in darkness and without the aid of elevators . In addition , the transformers that provided power to the neighboring Girard Trust Building were in the basement of One Meridian Plaza . The transformers were eventually shut down due to water accumulation in the basement and firefighters directing water streams from that building had to do so without the aid of elevators . 
 Firefighters were again hampered when it was discovered the pressure relief valves on the standpipes were improperly adjusted when installed in the building . The Philadelphia Fire Department nozzles allowed 100 psi nozzle pressure while One Meridian Plaza 's pressure relief valves were giving less than 60 psi discharge pressure , which was not sufficient to fight the fire . It was several hours into the fire before a technician who could adjust the valves arrived at the scene . 
 The area around the building was cleared of pedestrians and firefighting personnel because of falling glass and debris . The falling debris was dangerous for firefighters because they often had to cross the perimeter around the building to enter and leave the high @-@ rise . Hose lines stretched into the building were damaged by falling debris and one firefighter was struck by debris and seriously injured while tending to the lines . 
 = = = Lost firefighters = = = 
 During the second hour of the fire it spread onto the 23rd and 24th floors . Heavy smoke was building up in the stairwells and a captain and two firefighters from Engine 11 were assigned to go to the top level to ventilate the stairwell . The three firefighters went up a center staircase from the 22nd floor and soon radioed that they were disoriented by heavy smoke on the 30th floor . There were attempts to direct the firefighters through the radio , and soon after the captain requested permission to break a window for ventilation , which was followed by a message that the captain was down . Permission to break the window was given and a search and rescue effort was initiated . 
 Search teams were sent from the lower floors and searched the 30th floor , but did not find the missing firefighters . The teams then moved onto the upper levels where one team got lost on the 38th floor and ran out of air in their self @-@ contained breathing apparatus ( SCBA ) . That team was rescued by a search team that had been placed on the roof by a helicopter . Rescue attempts continued until helicopter operations were suspended due to heavy smoke and thermal drafts caused by the blaze . 
 Using a searchlight the helicopter crew searched the exterior of the building and at 1 : 17 AM February 24 , the helicopter spotted a broken window on the 28th floor located in an area that could not be seen from the street . At about 2 : 15 AM a rescue team was sent to the spot and found the three missing firefighters unconscious and out of air in their <unk> . The firefighters were brought to a medical triage set up on the 20th floor . There were attempts at resuscitation , but they were unsuccessful and the firefighters were pronounced dead .

 As the fire was going into its sixth hour it had spread up to the 26th floor . With inadequate water pressure coming from the standpipes , firefighters stretched hoses up the building 's stairwells to help fight the fire . While hoses were being taken up to the fire a sprinkler technician arrived to fix the water pressure . This improved the hose streams , but the fire had engulfed several floors and could not be contained with just hoses . By 7 : 00 AM , almost eleven hours into the fire , firefighters were able to get control of the fire on the 22nd through 24th floors , but the fire was still out of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards . Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse . At 7 : 00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger <unk> and the building was completely evacuated by 7 : 30 AM . After the evacuation , the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square . 
 The fire 's spread only stopped when it reached the 30th floor which was the first fire affected floor to have automatic sprinklers . Ten sprinklers extinguished the fire on the 30th floor and prevented continued spread . Contained by the automatic sprinklers and running out of fuel , the fire was declared under control at 3 : 01 PM . The fire lasted over nineteen hours , destroyed eight floors , and killed three firefighters and injured twenty @-@ four . Twelve alarms were called which brought fifty @-@ one engine companies , fifteen ladder companies , eleven specialized units , and over three hundred firefighters . The fire caused an estimated US $ 100 million in direct property loss . 
 = = After the fire = = 
 By February 26 city officials had determined One Meridian Plaza was not in danger of collapse . There was structural damage to horizontal steel beams and floor sections on most of the fire damaged floors . Under extreme fire exposure the beams and girders sagged and twisted and cracks appeared in the concrete floors . However , the overall structure was stable and able to support the weight of the building . Thermal expansion of the steel frame caused some of the granite panels to be dislodged from the building 's facade . The streets and buildings around One Meridian Plaza were closed and cordoned off . The 20 @-@ story Morris Building and several three @-@ story shops behind One Meridian Plaza on Chestnut Street were damaged by falling debris and sat unused for years until they were demolished in 2000 . The neighboring Girard Trust Building , then called Two Mellon Plaza , experienced extensive water damage forcing the closure of the building . A bank in the building reopened a month later but the rest of the tower remained vacant for years . The roads around the building were closed for months after the fire , including a portion of two of Philadelphia 's major streets , Broad and Market . 
 The removal of the uninhabitable One Meridian Plaza from the real estate market and the sudden relocation of the building 's tenants to other offices in Philadelphia took 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 square feet ( 140 @,@ 000 m2 ) of real estate off the market . The city 's office vacancy rate was 14 @.@ 3 percent at the end of 1990 ; in the two months after the fire , the vacancy rate lowered to 10 @.@ 7 percent . On December 18 Mayor Wilson Goode signed a law requiring every nonresidential building 75 feet ( 23 m ) tall or taller have sprinklers installed by 1997 . An estimated three hundred buildings in the city were affected by the law . 
 = = = Vacant eyesore = = = 
 In the years after the fire One Meridian Plaza stood in the middle of Philadelphia vacant . The fate of the building was up in the air as the building 's owners and the insurance company prepared for ligation on how to proceed with repairs , who would control those repairs , and at what cost . E / R Partners were proposing deconstructing the building down to the 19th floor and rebuilding from there . Aetna Corporation , the fire insurer , claimed that girders above the 19th level could be repaired and used cutting US $ 115 million in repair costs from the owner 's US $ 250 million estimate . Aetna also proposed taking over the reconstruction . E / R Partners spent US $ 50 million securing one Meridian Plaza and spent up to US $ 500 @,@ 000 a month on security guards , utilities and inspections by engineers as the building stood empty . 
 Lawsuits on behalf of sixteen people and businesses claiming losses as a result of the blaze were filed shortly after the fire in 1991 . In February 1995 a US $ 15 million agreement was reached to reimburse workers and businesses affected by the fire . While not admitting any liability , the US $ 15 million minus legal fees was paid by E / R Partners and was meant for uninsured losses for businesses and workers in One Meridian and the surrounding damaged buildings . 
 Declared " eyesore of the year " by The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1994 , the burned , empty tower was an embarrassment to the city according to an editorial in The Inquirer . The editorial said the feeling only became worse after One Meridian Plaza could be seen in the background in the film Philadelphia . The One Meridian Plaza fire left the area around it a commercial void . Nearly every major store in the area closed and property values fell . Neighboring property owners , such as the owner of the damaged buildings behind One Meridian Plaza , were waiting for a decision on the future of the building before going through with their own development plans . In 1996 the city of Philadelphia sued E / R Partners saying One Meridian Plaza was an environmental hazard and should be demolished or repaired . The city and Mayor Ed Rendell were afraid that when E / R Partners settled with Aetna they would take the money and leave the building unfixed . 
 = = = Deconstruction = = = 
 In March 1997 E / R Partners settled with Aetna receiving around US $ 300 million . After the legal issues were settled E / R Partners announced the building would be dismantled . With the announcement of the demolition the city dropped its lawsuit against the owners . Unable to implode the building because of the building density of the area , E / R Partners began an eighteen @-@ month , US $ 23 million process to dismantle the building . Early in the process , which began in 1998 , the owners hoped someone would buy the property as is or with the damaged portion of the structure removed , but that hope was soon abandoned . The process was finished in 1999 . At the time of the demolition it was the third tallest habitable building destroyed and is currently the seventh , ranking after the World Trade Center 's twin towers , the Singer Building , and the original Seven World Trade Center in New York , the Morrison Hotel in Chicago , and 130 Liberty Street in New York . 
 = = Replacement = = 
 The site of One Meridian Plaza was bought by the Arden Group in 2000 . The site was converted into a parking lot as construction on a new building was held up in a zoning feud with the neighboring site , 1441 Chestnut Street . 1441 Chestnut Street was the site of the Morris Building and other smaller buildings that sat behind One Meridian Plaza . The feud between Arden Group 's chief executive Craig Spencer and 1441 Chestnut Street developer Tim Mahoney began in 2003 . Spencer and Mahoney settled their dispute in March 2006 and construction on One Meridian 's 48 @-@ story replacement , the Residences at the Ritz @-@ Carlton began in May . The Residences at The Ritz @-@ Carlton opened in January 2009 . A memorial was unveiled on October 21 , 2009 at the skyscraper honoring the three firefighters who died in the fire . The memorial features plaques with the firefighter 's names . 
 = 1948 Bermuda – Newfoundland hurricane = 
 The 1948 Bermuda hurricane ( Air Weather Service designation : Dog ) was an intense and long @-@ lived Cape Verde @-@ type tropical cyclone that wrought significant damage to Bermuda and areas of Newfoundland in September 1948 . The storm was the eighth named storm and third hurricane of the annual hurricane season . Originating as a tropical wave off the coast of Africa on September 4 , the cyclone tracked a general westward path for much of its initial stages as it gradually intensified , reaching tropical storm intensity shortly after development and then hurricane intensity a day later . After reaching a longitude roughly equal to that of the Lesser Antilles , the hurricane began to curve northward on a parabolic track , bringing it near Bermuda at peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane on September 13 . Afterwards , the hurricane began to accelerate northeastwards and weaken . The waning tropical cyclone grazed Cape Race before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September 15 ; these remnants persisted for an additional day . 
 Despite never making landfall , the tropical cyclone disrupted numerous shipping lanes and inflicted damage on Bermuda and Newfoundland . In the former , the hurricane brought winds in excess of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) , downing power lines and felled trees . Property damage also resulted from the strong winds . Overall damage on the island totaled $ 400 @,@ 000 . After passing west of Bermuda , the tropical cyclone tracked across numerous shipping lanes . Two ships , the Leicester and Gaspar , encountered the hurricane and became stricken in open waters . Though most people were rescued from both ships , six people perished on the former while one died on the latter . Beginning on September 15 , the hurricane tracked east of Newfoundland , producing heavy rainfall on land . The precipitation flooded roads and caused streams to overflow , inundating additional areas . On the island , two people were killed . Overall , the hurricane caused eight fatalities . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On September 3 , the tropical wave from which the resulting hurricane would develop from was detected just off the coast of western Africa near Dakar . This marked the second consecutive year in which a tropical cyclone could be traced back as far east as Africa . In HURDAT – the official database for tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic dating back to 1851 Atlantic hurricane season – the area of disturbed weather is estimated to have organized into a tropical storm by 0600 UTC the following day . Over the course of the succeeding week , the tropical cyclone moved in a general westward direction as it gradually intensified , reaching hurricane intensity by 0000 UTC on September 5 and then attaining the equivalent of a modern @-@ day Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane scale at 0600 UTC on September 8 . Up until this time , its existence and trek across the central Atlantic was only inferred , however , aircraft reconnaissance detected and as such confirmed the existence of the tropical cyclone the following day while the hurricane was situated approximately 900 mi ( 1 @,@ 400 km ) east of Antigua . Operationally , however , the reconnaissance flight significantly underestimated the winds of the tropical cyclone , with estimates of tropical storm @-@ force winds at the storm 's center . 
 Thereafter , the hurricane began curving northward as it continued to intensify , reaching the equivalent of a modern @-@ day Category 3 hurricane – a major hurricane – by September 11 . Two days later , the storm strengthened further into a Category 4 hurricane . As no reasonably quantifiable strengthening occurred afterwards , this also marked the storm 's official peak intensity as maximum sustained winds were analyzed at 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) . However , aircraft reconnaissance estimated wind speeds of at least 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) at roughly the same time frame . The storm 's northward recurvature caused it to track just west of Bermuda late on September 13 . Afterwards , a weakening trend began as the hurricane tracked northeastward into more northerly latitudes . By September 15 , the storm had been downgraded to minimal hurricane intensity . After passing south of Cape Race later that day , the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone , and continued to track northward until it was last noted by 1800 UTC the next day near Greenland . During the storm 's twelve @-@ day trek , the hurricane tracked approximately 3 @,@ 500 mi ( 5 @,@ 600 km ) , roughly equidistant to the distance between New York and London .

 = = = Central Atlantic and Bermuda = = = 
 As the hurricane traversed the Central Atlantic , the United States Weather Bureau indicated that the storm would not be a threat to continental land masses due to its isolated position . However , ships in the storm 's vicinity and to the northwest of the hurricane were advised caution . Other shipping lanes in the forecast path of the hurricane were also warned . After recurving in the direction of Bermuda , the British overseas colony was advised to begin prompt precautionary measures against storm surge and strong winds , which were expected from the hurricane . Aircraft from the United States Air Force and Navy stationed in Bermuda were sent to airfields in the United States to avoid the hurricane , while a Navy task force of twelve ships including the escort carrier USS Mindoro ( CVE @-@ 120 ) were dispatched from the island . The U.S. naval operating base moved boats from exposed areas into safer parts of the base . Similar precautionary measures were undertaken by the British naval operating base . 
 On Bermuda , the hurricane brought sustained winds estimated between 93 – 103 mph ( 150 – 166 km / h ) , with higher gusts . A minimum pressure of 958 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 30 inHg ) was recorded , though a lower pressure may have occurred on the island as the barometer had been falling at the time . The strong winds downed power lines and felled trees , littering insular streets with debris . As a result , power outages occurred and loss of telecommunications was reported . Radio stations based on the island went silent due to the power loss . An emergency backup power generator at King Edward Memorial Hospital was used to restore electrical power to the facility . However , oil lamps were still used in place of any form of electrical lighting . Several slate roofs were torn from their buildings from the strong winds . Heavy rainfall associated with the hurricane flooded long stretches of roadway . Some roads were blocked and rendered impassable by the rainfall . At the local harbor , six vessels were inundated by the strong offshore wave action . Overall , property damage on the island was estimated at $ 400 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Mid @-@ Atlantic and Newfoundland = = = 
 After sweeping past Bermuda , the Weather Bureau continued to advise caution to shipping lanes in the storm 's proximity . Two coastal railway steamers destined for a Newfoundland port were delayed as a result of the approaching storm . All flights headed for Torbay Airport were suspended until the storm 's passage . Before affecting Newfoundland , however , the hurricane impacted numerous shipping lanes in the open Atlantic . The freighter Leicester , which had departed from London and was headed for New York City , was caught in the hurricane late on September 14 while situated roughly 400 mi ( 640 km ) southwest of Cape Race , Newfoundland . As weather conditions deteriorated , the ship began to list , and as such the crew abandoned the ship late the following day . The American steamship Cecil N. Bean and the Argentinian steamship <unk> both assisted in rescue operations and rescued 39 crew members . However , six other remained unaccounted for and were presumed dead . The Portuguese fishing schooner Gaspar was also caught in the storm roughly 300 mi ( 480 km ) off of Newfoundland , and although initial reports presumed that it had already sunk , the United States Coast Guard indicated that the ship was in no need of assistance . However , the ship was still abandoned and 41 crewmen were rescued , though one person was lost . 
 Much of the effects from the hurricane on Newfoundland occurred on September 15 and continued until September 18 . With winds equivalent to that of a Category 1 hurricane , the cyclone brushed east of the island , bringing extensive flooding . Offshore , a ship estimated winds in excess of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) off of Grand Bank . Precipitation peaked at a record 4 @.@ 5 in ( 110 mm ) at Fort Pepperrell . In St. John 's , train traffic was effectively halted because of the hurricane . Silt kicked up by the strong winds covered railroad tracks in the southern portions of the city , while heavy rainfall flooded several city streets . Similar problems occurred in Avondale . The nearby Rennie River overflowed its banks , inundating adjacent land . The urban flooding damaged adjacent infrastructure . A three @-@ year @-@ old girl died on September 16 after a landslide triggered by the rain filled the first floor of her home . This was the only death associated with the hurricane on the island . In Holyrood , the local highway was washed out in areas . A small trestle with two concrete abutments were swept off into the adjacent bay . Another road leading to Cape Saint Francis suffered wash outs as deep as 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) . Small bridges were also damaged , and some were washed away . As with the Rennie River , the Waterford River also overflowed its banks due to excessive recharge , and as such inundated 13 homes . Another river near Kilbride overflowed , flooding adjacent plots of land and tearing apart pavement . In this manner , several roads were rendered impassable and were cut off to traffic . 
 = Russian cruiser Gromoboi = 
 Gromoboi ( Russian : <unk> , meaning : " Thunderer " ) was an armoured cruiser built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the late 1890s . She was designed as a long @-@ range commerce raider and served as such during the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 . When the war broke out , she was based in Vladivostok and made several sorties in search of Japanese shipping in the conflict 's early months without much success . 
 Gromoboi , with the other armoured cruisers of the Vladivostok Cruiser Squadron , attempted to rendezvous in the Strait of Tsushima with the main portion of the Russian Pacific Fleet sailing from Port Arthur in August 1904 . The Fleet was delayed , and the squadron returned to port alone . On the return , the squadron encountered a Japanese squadron of four armoured cruisers blocking their passage to base . The Japanese sank the oldest Russian ship , Rurik , and damaged Gromoboi and Rossia during the subsequent Battle off Ulsan . Both Russian ships were repaired within two months . Gromoboi ran aground immediately after completing her repairs and was out of action for four months . Three months after the damage from the grounding incident was repaired , she struck a mine , but successfully returned to port . Her armament was reinforced while under repair , but she saw no further action during the war . 
 Gromoboi was transferred to the Russian Baltic Fleet after the end of the war and began a lengthy refit that was completed in 1911 . She was mostly inactive during World War I , but had her armament and protection upgraded during the war . She was placed into reserve in 1918 and sold to a German company in 1922 for scrapping . She was forced aground near Liepāja during a storm en route to Germany and was scrapped in place . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Gromoboi was originally intended to be a repeat of Rossia , but a design modification for thicker armour and improved engines made that unfeasible . The use of Rossia 's hull design meant that the ships looked alike . 
 Gromoboi was 481 feet ( 146 @.@ 6 m ) long overall . She had a maximum beam of 68 @.@ 6 feet ( 20 @.@ 9 m ) and a draught of 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) . The ship displaced 12 @,@ 455 long tons ( 12 @,@ 655 t ) , only 95 long tons ( 97 t ) more than designed . She was sheathed in wood and copper to reduce biofouling . As completed Gromoboi trimmed badly by the bow , which reduced her speed and made her very wet forward . <unk> had to be shifted aft and ballast added to the rear of the ship to correct her trim , but she was regarded as a good sea boat afterward with an easy , although rapid , roll . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Gromoboi dispensed with Rossia 's cruising engine on the centre shaft . Three equally powerful vertical triple expansion steam engines were used with a designed total of 14 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 813 kW ) , but they developed 15 @,@ 496 ihp ( 11 @,@ 555 kW ) on trials and drove the ship to a maximum speed of 20 @.@ 1 knots ( 37 @.@ 2 km / h ; 23 @.@ 1 mph ) . Thirty @-@ two Belleville water @-@ tube boilers provided steam for the engines . She could carry a maximum of 2 @,@ 400 long tons ( 2 @,@ 439 t ) of coal . This gave her a radius of action of 8 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 15 @,@ 000 km ; 9 @,@ 320 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Gromoboi 's main armament consisted of four 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) 45 @-@ calibre Pattern 1892 guns ; the forward pair was mounted in casemates above the forward main @-@ deck 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) gun 's casemate . The two rear guns were situated in sponsons abreast the mizzenmast , protected by gun shields . The guns could be depressed to − 5 ° and elevated to 18 ° . They fired 193 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 87 @.@ 8 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 950 feet per second ( 900 m / s ) which gave a range of 12 @,@ 000 yd ( 11 @,@ 000 m ) at 13 ° elevation . 
 Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) / 45 Pattern 1892 guns . One gun was mounted under the forecastle and another in the stern ; neither gun could fire to the side . Most of the remaining guns were mounted in casemates , the forward pair in front of the eight @-@ inch guns on the upper deck and the rest on the main deck . One pair was mounted on the upper deck protected by gun shields . In their pivot mounts the guns could depress to -6 ° and elevate to + 20 ° . They fired 91 @.@ 4 @-@ pound ( 41 @.@ 5 kg ) Pattern 1907 high explosive projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 600 feet per second ( 790 m / s ) . This gave a range of 12 @,@ 600 yd ( 11 @,@ 500 m ) at maximum elevation . 240 rounds per gun were carried by Gromoboi . 
 Defence against torpedo boats was provided by a variety of light @-@ calibre weapons . Gromoboi had 24 75 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) Canet Pattern 1892 50 @-@ caliber guns mounted in sponsons on the upper deck , protected by gun shields . The gun fired 10 @.@ 8 @-@ pound ( 4 @.@ 9 kg ) shells to a range of about 8 @,@ 600 yards ( 7 @,@ 864 m ) at its maximum elevation of 21 ° with a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 700 ft / s ( 820 m / s ) . The rate of fire was between twelve and fifteen rounds per minute . 
 The ship carried twelve 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns . They fired a 3 @.@ 3 @-@ pound ( 1 @.@ 5 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 476 ft / s ( 450 m / s ) at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a range of 2 @,@ 020 yards ( 1 @,@ 850 m ) . The ship also carried 18 37 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss guns . These fired a 1 @.@ 1 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 50 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 450 ft / s ( 440 m / s ) at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a range of 3 @,@ 038 yards ( 2 @,@ 778 m ) . 
 Gromoboi also had four submerged 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes , with two mounted on each broadside . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The Naval Ministry had hoped to increase the Gromoboi 's armour thickness and increase the armour protection of the armament , but still use Rossia 's hull design . The Ministry also hoped to use the new , more resistant Krupp armour , but Russian plants had proven unable to manufacture it when it was ordered and Harvey armour was used instead . In fact , for Gromoboi , the waterline belt was reduced in thickness by 2 inches ( 51 mm ) from the older ship to six inches to better protect her guns . The belt was shortened by 100 feet ( 30 @.@ 5 m ) in length to only 300 feet ( 91 @.@ 4 m ) . It was reduced in height by 9 inches ( 229 mm ) as well to a total of 7 feet 9 inches ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) ; it extended 2 feet 9 inches ( 0 @.@ 8 m ) above the waterline and 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) below the waterline . The belt was closed off by six @-@ inch bulkheads fore and aft . 
 The Gromoboi casemates were 4 @.@ 7 inches ( 119 mm ) thick , with two @-@ inch backs and 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) roofs . The two @-@ inch thick transverse bulkhead fore and aft protected them from raking fire . The armour deck was 1 @.@ 5 inches thick on the flat and 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) thick where it sloped down to meet the belt . The protective deck extended fore and aft of the armour deck and ranged from 2 @.@ 5 – 3 inches ( 64 – 76 mm ) in thickness . The change in the machinery allowed Gromoboi to dispense with Rossia 's glacis armour that had been necessary to protect the tops of the engine cylinders . The conning tower had walls 12 inches ( 305 mm ) thick , made of Krupp armour . The funnel uptakes and ammunition hoists were protected by 1 @.@ 5 inches of armour between the lower and middle decks .

 Gromoboi was built by the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg . Construction began on 14 June 1897 , although she was not formally laid down until 7 May 1898 , and the ship was launched on 8 May 1899 . She was transferred to Kronstadt on 24 November 1899 to finish fitting out , but was forced aground by sea ice . She was freed three days later , but needed repairs to her sheathing . She left Liepāja on 10 December 1900 en route to the Far East and stopped briefly at Kiel , where she was inspected by Prince Henry of Prussia , and at Plymouth where the officers visited the Devonport naval base . She represented Russia at the granting of the constitution to Australia , visiting Sydney and Melbourne in April – May 1901 , before visiting Nagasaki in July . Gromoboi finally reached Port Arthur on 29 July 1901 . She remained in the Pacific until the beginning of the Russo @-@ Japanese War in 1904 . During this voyage she was commanded by Karl Petrovich Jessen . 
 = = = Russo @-@ Japanese War = = = 
 By this time , Gromoboi was assigned of the Vladivostok Cruiser Squadron under the command of Rear Admiral Karl Jessen . The other ships were the armoured cruisers Rossia and Rurik as well as the protected cruiser Bogatyr . The squadron made a number of sorties against Japanese shipping early in the war . Only one was reasonably successful : in June 1904 the squadron sank the Hitachi Maru , carrying eighteen 28 @-@ centimetre ( 11 in ) siege howitzers and over 1000 troops intended for the siege of Port Arthur . 
 = = = = Battle off Ulsan = = = = 
 During the war the bulk of the Russian Pacific Fleet was located in Port Arthur where it was blockaded by the Japanese . On 10 August , the ships at Port Arthur attempted breakout to Vladivostok , but were turned back in the Battle of the Yellow Sea . Admiral Jessen was ordered to rendezvous with them , but the order was delayed . His ships had to raise steam , so he did not sortie until the evening of 13 August . Bogatyr had been damaged earlier when she grounded and did not sail with the squadron . By dawn he had reached the island of Tsushima in the Tsushima Strait between Korea and Japan . He turned back for Vladivostok when he failed to see any ships from the Port Arthur squadron . 36 miles ( 58 km ) north of the island he encountered the Japanese squadron commanded by Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojō tasked to patrol the Tsushima Strait . The Japanese force had four modern armoured cruisers , Iwate , Izumo , Tokiwa , and Azuma . The two squadrons had passed during the night without spotting one another and each had reversed course around first light . This put the Japanese ships astride the Russian route to Vladivostok . 
 Jessen turned to the northeast when he spotted the Japanese at 05 : 00 and they followed suit , albeit on a slightly converging course . Both sides opened fire around 05 : 23 at a range of 8 @,@ 500 metres ( 9 @,@ 300 yd ) . The Japanese ships concentrated their fire on Rurik , the rear ship of the Russian formation . She was hit fairly quickly and began to fall astern of the other two ships . Jessen turned southeast in an attempt to open the range , but this blinded the Russian gunners with the rising sun and prevented any of their broadside guns from bearing on the Japanese . About 06 : 00 , Jessen turned 180 ° to starboard in an attempt to reach the Korean coast and to allow Rurik to rejoin the squadron . Kamimura followed suit around 06 : 10 , but turned to port , which opened the range between the squadrons . Azuma then developed engine problems and the Japanese squadron slowed to conform with her best speed . Firing recommenced at 06 : 24 and Rurik was hit three times in the stern , flooding her steering compartment ; she had to be steered with her engines . Her speed continued to decrease , further exposing her to Japanese fire , and her steering jammed to port around 06 : 40 . 
 Jessen made another 180 ° turn in an attempt to interpose his two ships between the Japanese and Rurik , but the latter ship suddenly turn to starboard and increased speed and passed between Jessen 's ships and the Japanese . Kamimura turned 180 ° as well so that both squadrons were heading southeast on parallel courses , but Jessen quickly made another 180 ° turn so that they headed on opposing courses . Iwate was hit around this time , which knocked out three 6 @-@ inch and one 12 @-@ pounder guns , killing 32 and wounding 43 . The Japanese squadron opened the range again when it made a 180 ° another turn to port . The Russians reversed course for the third time around 07 : 45 in another attempt to support Rurik although Rossia was on fire herself ; her fires were extinguished about twenty minutes later . Kamimura circled Rurik to the south at 08 : 00 and allowed the other two Russian ships to get to his north and gave them an uncontested route to Vladivostok . Despite this , Jessen turned back once more at 08 : 15 and ordered Rurik to make her own way back to Vladivostok before turning north at his maximum speed , about 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 About this time Kamimura 's two elderly protected cruisers , Naniwa and Takachiho , were approaching from the south . Their arrival allowed Kamimura to pursue Jessen with all of his armoured cruisers while the two new arrivals dealt with Rurik . They fought a running battle with the Russians for the next hour and a half ; scoring enough hits on them to force their speed down to 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . Azuma 's engines again broke down during this chase and she was replaced in the line by Tokiwa . The Japanese closed to a minimum of about 5 @,@ 000 metres ( 5 @,@ 500 yd ) , but Kamimura then opened the range up to 6 @,@ 500 metres ( 7 @,@ 100 yd ) . 
 About 10 : 00 , Kamimura 's gunnery officer erroneously informed him that Izumo had expended three @-@ quarters of her ammunition and he turned back after a five @-@ minute rapid @-@ fire barrage . He did not wish to leave the Tsushima Strait unguarded and thought that he could use his remaining ammunition on Rurik . By this time she had been sunk by Naniwa and Takachiho which had closed to 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 3 @,@ 300 yd ) of Rurik in order to finish her off . They had radioed Kamimura that she was sunk , but he did not receive the message . Shortly after the Japanese turned back , Gromoboi and Rossia were forced to heave @-@ to to make repairs . 
 Gromoboi suffered 87 dead and 170 wounded ; far more than Rossia 's 44 dead and 156 wounded . This was attributable to Rossia 's captain 's policy of ordering the gun crews for his quick @-@ firing guns on the engaged side to lie down and those on the unengaged side to go below , in contrast to the Gromoboi keeping her light guns manned at all times . Gromoboi was hit fifteen times on the starboard side of her hull and seven times on her port side , plus other hits in her funnels , boats and decks . She also suffered a fire caused by the ignition of excess propellant charges . Despite this number of hits , she was not badly damaged because her waterline belt was not penetrated . She was repaired within two months by the rudimentary facilities available at Vladivostok . 
 Immediately following her repairs she ran aground outside Vladivostok on 13 October and was not ready for sea until February 1905 . The Russians took this opportunity to reinforce her armament with six more 6 @-@ inch guns mounted on her upper deck , protected by lightly armoured casemates . Her armament was rearranged as well with her foremost six @-@ inch guns moved from their casemates to the forecastle and the rearmost six @-@ inch guns moved forward . Room for these changes was made by removing many of her lighter guns ; she retained only nineteen 75 mm and two 37 mm guns . She also received several Barr and Stroud rangefinders at this time . While testing her new Telefunken radio equipment on 24 May she struck a mine near her forward boiler room . She was able to return to Vladivostok for repairs , but took no further part in the war . 
 = = = Interwar period = = = 
 Gromoboi returned to the Baltic Fleet after the war . There she was given a lengthy refit that was finished in 1911 . Her engines and boilers were reconditioned , and her rear torpedo tubes were removed . The forward 15 @-@ inch torpedo tubes were replaced by 18 @-@ inch ( 460 mm ) tubes . Her foremast was removed and replaced by her mizzenmast ; her mainmast was moved aft in place of the mizzenmast and searchlights were installed on a platform on each mast . A casemate with 3 @-@ inch sides and a 1 @-@ inch roof was built around the rear eight @-@ inch guns and the rear six @-@ inch guns were moved aft and protected by a casemate with two @-@ inch sides and a .75 @-@ inch ( 19 mm ) roof . The thickness of the upper @-@ deck casemates was increased to two inches . Armoured towers fore and aft were built for her rangefinders . Her light armament was reduced to four 75 mm and four 47 mm guns . Engine trials were conducted in late 1910 and were unsatisfactory as they were overheating while delivering only 9 @,@ 979 indicated horsepower ( 7 @,@ 441 kW ) . The trials were run again on 27 July 1911 and were more satisfactory as they developed 13 @,@ 337 indicated horsepower ( 9 @,@ 945 kW ) while Gromoboi reached 18 @.@ 5 knots ( 34 @.@ 3 km / h ; 21 @.@ 3 mph ) . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 Gromoboi served in the 2nd Cruiser Brigade of the Baltic Fleet during World War I. She was modified to serve as a fast minelayer with a capacity of two hundred mines . 
 She engaged the German battlecruiser SMS Von der Tann at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland on August 10 , 1915 . 
 Her armament was changed in 1916 – 17 as well ; she exchanged the six @-@ inch guns on the bow and stern for eight @-@ inch guns . These additions increased her broadside to four eight @-@ inch and eleven six @-@ inch guns . All of her remaining light guns were removed and she received two 2 @.@ 5 @-@ inch and two 47 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns . All of these additions raised her displacement to about 13 @,@ 200 long tons ( 13 @,@ 412 t ) . 
 Gromoboi came under control of the Soviet Red Fleet in September 1917 . The Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have them interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over . Gromoboi sailed to Kronstadt in what became known as the ' Ice Voyage ' and was placed into reserve shortly after her arrival . She was sold to a German company for scrapping on 1 July 1922 and ran aground near Liepāja while under tow to Germany . She was scrapped in place .

 Lucas stated that he conceived the Star Wars saga 's story in the form of a plot outline in 1973 . However , he later clarified that , at the time of the saga 's conception , he had not fully realized the details — only major plot points . He began working on Episode III even before the previous film , Attack of the Clones , was released , proposing to concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven battles on seven planets . Michael Kaminski , in The Secret History of Star Wars , surmises that Lucas found flaws with Anakin 's fall to the dark side and radically re @-@ organized the plot . For instance , instead of opening the film with various Clone Wars battles , Lucas decided instead to focus on Anakin , ending the film 's first act with his killing of Count Dooku , an action that signals his descent to the dark side . 
 A significant number of fans speculated online about the film 's subtitle ; rumored titles included Rise of the Empire , The Creeping Fear ( which was also named as the film 's title on the official website on April Fool 's 2004 ) , and Birth of the Empire . Eventually , Revenge of the Sith also became a " guessed title " that George Lucas would later announce to be true . The title is a reference to Revenge of the Jedi , the original title of Return of the Jedi ; Lucas changed the title scant weeks before the premiere of Return of the Jedi , declaring that Jedi do not seek revenge . 
 Since Lucas refocused the film on Anakin , he had to sacrifice certain extraneous plot points relating to Attack of the Clones . Lucas had previously promised fans that he would explain the mystery behind the erasure of the planet Kamino from the Jedi Archives . However , Lucas abandoned this plot thread in order to devote more time to Anakin 's story , leaving the matter unresolved on film . As a compromise , Lucas permitted author James Luceno to explain the mystery of Kamino 's erasure and the origins of the Clone army in his expanded universe novel Labyrinth of Evil . 
 Lucas had originally planned to include even more ties to the original trilogy , and wrote early drafts of the script in which a 10 @-@ year @-@ old Han Solo appeared on Kashyyyk , but the role was not cast or shot . He also wrote a scene in which Palpatine reveals to Anakin that he created him from <unk> , and is thus his " father " , a clear parallel to Vader 's revelation to Luke in The Empire Strikes Back , but Lucas ejected this scene as well . 
 After principal photography was complete in 2003 , Lucas made even more changes in Anakin 's character , sharpening Anakin 's motivations for turning to the dark side . Lucas accomplished this " rewrite " through editing the principal footage and filming new scenes during pick @-@ ups in London in 2004 . In the previous versions , Anakin had a myriad of reasons for turning to the dark side , one of which was his sincere belief that the Jedi were plotting to take over the Republic . Although this is still intact in the finished film , by revising and refilming many scenes , Lucas emphasized Anakin 's desire to save Padmé from death . Thus , in the version that made it to theatres , Anakin falls to the dark side primarily to save Padmé . 
 = = = Art design = = = 
 After the screenplay 's earliest draft was submitted , the art department began designing the various ways that each element could appear on screen . 
 For the Kashyyyk environment , the art department turned to the much derided Star Wars Holiday Special for inspiration . Over a period of months , Lucas would approve hundreds of designs that would eventually appear in the film . He would later rewrite entire scenes and action sequences to correspond to certain designs he had chosen . The designs were then shipped to " pre @-@ visualization " to create moving CGI versions known as " animatics " . Ben Burtt would edit these scenes with Lucas in order to previsualize what the film would look like before the scenes were even filmed . The pre @-@ visualization footage featured a basic raw CGI environment with equally unprocessed CGI characters performing a scene ( typically an action sequence ) . Steven Spielberg was also allowed to assist both the art and pre @-@ visualization department 's designs for several action sequences in Revenge of the Sith . Later , the pre @-@ visualization and art department designs were sent to the production department to begin " bringing the film out of the concept phase " by building the various sets , props and costumes . To determine the required sets , Lucas analyzed each scene with the staff to see which moments the actors would come in most contact with the set , warranting the set to be constructed . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Although the first scene filmed was the final scene to appear in the film ( shot during the filming of Attack of the Clones in 2000 ) , principal photography on the film occurred from June 30 , 2003 to September 17 , 2003 , with additional photography occurring at Shepperton Studios and Elstree Studios in London from August 2004 to January 31 , 2005 . The initial filming took place on sound stages at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney , although practical environments were shot as background footage later to be composited into the film . These included the limestone mountains depicting Kashyyyk , which were filmed in Phuket , Thailand ( they were later damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami ) . The production company was also fortunate enough to be shooting at the same time that Mount Etna erupted in Italy . Camera crews were sent to the location to shoot several angles of the volcano that were later spliced into the background of the animatics and the final film version of the planet Mustafar . 
 While shooting key dramatic scenes , Lucas would often use an " A camera " and " B camera " , or the " V technique " , a process that involves shooting with two or more cameras at the same time in order to gain several angles of the same performance . Using the HD technology developed for the film , the filmmakers were able to send footage to the editors the same day it was shot , a process that would require a full 24 hours had it been shot on film . Footage featuring the planet Mustafar was given to editor Roger Barton , who was on location in Sydney , Australia cutting the climactic duel . All other footage was forwarded to lead editor Ben Burtt at Skywalker Ranch in California . 
 Actors Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor began rehearsing their climactic lightsaber duel long before Lucas would shoot it . They trained extensively with stunt coordinator Nick Gillard to memorize and perform their duel together . As in the previous two prequel films , McGregor and Christensen performed their own lightsaber fighting scenes without the use of stunt doubles . The speed at which Vader and Obi @-@ Wan engage in their duel is mostly the speed at which it was filmed , although there are instances where single frames were removed to increase the velocity of particular strikes . An example of this occurs as Obi @-@ Wan strikes down on Vader after applying an armlock in the duel 's first half . 
 Revenge of the Sith eventually became the first Star Wars film in which Anakin Skywalker and the suited Darth Vader were played by the same actor in the same film . As Christensen recounted , it was originally intended to simply have a " tall guy " in the Darth Vader costume , but after " begging and pleading " Christensen persuaded Lucas to have the Vader costume used in the film created specifically to fit him . The new costume featured shoe lifts and a muscle suit . It also required Christensen ( who is 6 feet 1 inch or 1 @.@ 85 metres tall ) to look through the helmet 's mouthpiece . 
 In 2004 , Gary Oldman was originally approached to provide the voice of General Grievous ; however , complications arose during contract negotiations after Oldman learned the film was to be made outside of the Screen Actors Guild , of which he is a member . He backed out of the role rather than violate the union 's rules . Matthew Wood , who ultimately voiced Grievous , disputed this story at Celebration III , held in Indianapolis . According to him , Oldman is a friend of producer Rick McCallum , and thus recorded an audition as a favor to him , but was not chosen . Wood , who was also the supervising sound editor , was in charge of the auditions and submitted his audition anonymously in the midst of 30 others , under the initials " A.S. " for Alan Smithee . Days later he received a phone call asking for the full name to the initials " A.S. " An internet hoax said John Rhys @-@ Davies was considered for the role . 
 = = = Visual effects = = = 
 The post @-@ production department began work during filming and continued until weeks before the film was released in 2005 . Special effects were created using almost all formats , including model work , CGI and practical effects . The same department later composited all such work into the filmed scenes — both processes taking nearly two years to complete . Revenge of the Sith has 2 @,@ 151 shots that use special effects , a world record . 
 As the DVD featurette Within a Minute illustrates , the film required 910 artists and 70 @,@ 441 man @-@ hours to create 49 seconds of footage for the Mustafar duel alone . Members of <unk> , the Official Star Wars Fan Club , received a special look into the production . Benefits included not only special articles , but they also received access to a webcam that transmitted a new image every 20 seconds during the time it was operating in Fox Studios Australia . Many times the stars , and Lucas himself , were spotted on the webcam . 
 = = = Deleted scenes = = = 
 During the process of shaping the film for its theatrical release , Lucas and his editors dropped many scenes , and even an entire subplot , from the completed film . 
 Lucas excised all the scenes of a group of Senators ( including Padmé , Bail Organa , and Mon Mothma ( Genevieve O 'Reilly ) ) organizing an alliance to prevent the Chancellor from receiving any more emergency powers . Though this is essentially the Rebel Alliance 's birth , the scenes were discarded to achieve more focus on Anakin 's story . The scene where Yoda arrives on Dagobah to begin his self @-@ imposed exile was also cut , but is featured in a deleted scene in the DVD release , although McCallum stated he hopes Lucas may add it to the release if Lucas releases a six @-@ episode DVD box set . 
 Many scenes concerning Jedi deaths during the execution of Order 66 were cut . The deaths of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were either cut from the film or not filmed in the first place . 
 Bai Ling filmed minor scenes for the film playing a senator , but her role was cut during editing . She claimed this was because she posed for the June 2005 issue of Playboy , whose appearance on newsstands coincided with the film 's May release . Lucas denied this , stating that the cut had been made more than a year earlier , and that he had cut his own daughter 's scenes as well .

 The film 's soundtrack was released by Sony Classical on May 3 , 2005 , more than two weeks before the film 's release . The music was composed and conducted by John Williams ( who composed and conducted the score for the other six films in the Star Wars saga ) , and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and London Voices . A music video titled A Hero Falls was created for the film 's theme , " Battle of the Heroes " , featuring footage from the film and was also available on the DVD . 
 The soundtrack also came with a collectors ' DVD , Star Wars : A Musical Journey , at no additional cost . The DVD , hosted by McDiarmid , features 16 music videos set to remastered selections of music from all six film scores , set chronologically through the saga . This album was chosen as one of Amazon.com 's Top 100 Editors ' Picks of 2005 ( # 83 ) .

 Star Wars : Episode III – Revenge of the Sith charity premieres took place in Seattle , Los Angeles , Chicago , Washington D.C. , Boston , Denver , Atlanta , San Francisco , and Miami on Thursday , May 12 , 2005 ; and on May 13 , 2005 , there were two additional charity premiere screenings in George Lucas 's hometown of <unk> official premiere was at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival ( out of competition ) on May 16 . Its theatrical release in most other countries took place on May 19 to coincide with the 1999 release of The Phantom Menace ( the 1977 release of A New Hope and the 1983 release of Return of the Jedi were also released on the same day and month , six years apart ) . The global <unk> firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas claimed one week before the premiere that it may have cost the U.S. economy approximately US $ 627 million in lost productivity because of employees who took a day off or reported in sick . Grauman 's Chinese Theatre , a traditional venue for the Star Wars films , did not show it . However , a line of people stood there for more than a month hoping to convince someone to change this . Most of them took advantage of an offer to see the film at a nearby cinema , ArcLight Cinemas ( formerly the " Cinerama Dome " ) . On May 16 , the Empire Cinema in London 's Leicester Square hosted a day @-@ long Star Wars marathon showing of all six films ; an army of Imperial stormtroopers " guarded " the area , and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra gave a free concert of Star Wars music .

 A copy of the film leaked onto peer @-@ to @-@ peer file sharing networks just hours after opening in theaters . The film was a time @-@ stamped workprint , suggesting it may have come from within the industry rather than from someone who videotaped an advance screening . Eight people were later charged with copyright infringement and distributing material illegally . Documents filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney allege that a copy of the film was taken from an unnamed Californian post @-@ production office by an employee , who later pleaded guilty to his charges . The illegal copy was passed among seven people until reaching an eighth party , who also pleaded guilty to uploading to an unnamed P2P network . 
 Shortly after the above @-@ mentioned print was leaked , it was released in Shanghai as a bootleg DVD with Chinese subtitles . The unknown producer of this DVD also chose to include English subtitles , which were in fact translated back into English from the Chinese translation , rather than using the original English script . One error in translation that recurs several times in the film is that the phrase " it seems " ( <unk> ) was rendered as " good elephant " . Jedi Council becomes Presbyterian Church . The mis @-@ translation also caused the word " fuck " ( a mis @-@ translation of " work " ) to appear four times in the subtitles , and rendered Darth Vader 's cry of " <unk> " ( <unk> ) as " Do not want . " This last translation error would later be popularized as an internet meme . 
 = = = Rating = = = 
 Revenge of the Sith is the first Star Wars film to receive a PG @-@ 13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) , officially for " sci @-@ fi violence and some intense images " , namely for the scene in which Darth Vader is set aflame by lava and molten rock . Lucas had stated months before the MPAA 's decision that he felt the film should receive a PG @-@ 13 rating , because of Anakin 's final moments and the film 's content being the darkest and most intense of all six films . Some critics , including Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper , later responded that children would be able to handle the film as long as they had parental guidance , hence a " PG rating " . All previously released films in the series were rated PG . The PG @-@ 13 rating had not existed when the films in the original trilogy were released ; however , the original trilogy 's films were later re @-@ submitted to the MPAA due to changes in the re @-@ released versions and once again received PG ratings . When Revenge of the Sith was released in Canada , it was given a PG rating in most provinces , excluding Quebec , where it was rated G. In the United Kingdom it received a 12A rating by the British Board of Film Classification ( BBFC ) . In Australia , the film was rated M for mature audiences by the Australian Classification Board ( ACB ) .

 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave Revenge of the Sith a 79 % approval rating and average rating of 7 @.@ 3 / 10 based on 282 reviews from critics , with the consensus being " With Episode III : Revenge of the Sith , George Lucas brings his second Star Wars trilogy to a suitably thrilling and often poignant – if still a bit uneven – conclusion . " Metacritic gave the film a 68 out of 100 , which indicates " generally favorable reviews " . 
 Most critics have considered the film to be the best of the prequels . A. O. Scott of The New York Times concluded that it was " the best of the four episodes Mr. Lucas has directed " , and equal to The Empire Strikes Back as " the richest and most challenging movie in the cycle " . In a 2007 summary of the 100 Best Science @-@ Fiction Films on Rotten Tomatoes , Revenge of the Sith was placed 51 out of 100 , making it the only prequel film in the Star Wars series to earn a ranking . Jonathan Rosenbaum , a critic who disliked A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back , gave the film a positive review saying that it had a " relatively thoughtful story " . Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times gave the film three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four , writing " If [ Lucas ] got bogged down in solemnity and theory in Episode II : Attack of the Clones , the Force is in a jollier mood this time , and Revenge of the Sith is a great entertainment . " 
 In 2012 , art critic Camille Paglia praised the film in Glittering Images , comparing some of its scenes to works by modern painters and calling it " the greatest work of art in recent memory " . Paglia explained " The long finale of Revenge of the Sith has more inherent artistic value , emotional power , and global impact than anything by the artists you name . It 's because the art world has flat @-@ lined and become an echo chamber of received opinion and toxic over @-@ praise . It 's like the emperor 's new clothes -- people are too intimidated to admit what they secretly think or what they might think with their blinders off . Episode III epitomizes the modern digital art movement , more so than other piece from the last 30 years . I had considered using Japanese anime for the digital art chapter of the book , but it lacked the overwhelming operatic power and yes , seriousness of Lucas 's Revenge of the Sith . " 
 Though many critics and fans saw it as the strongest of the three prequels , some saw it as more or less on par with The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones . Much of the criticism for the film was directed towards the dialogue , particularly the film 's romantic scenes , and for Hayden Christensen 's performance ( which won him his second Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor ) . Critics and fans alike were quick to jump on such lines as " Hold me , Ani . Hold me , like you did by the lake on Naboo ... where there was nothing but our love ... " Critics have claimed this demonstrated Lucas ' weakness as a writer of dialogue , a subject with which Lucas openly agreed when receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute . 
 Some American conservatives criticized the film , claiming it has a liberal bias and is a commentary on the George W. Bush administration and the Iraq War . Some websites went so far as to propose a boycott of the film . Lucas defended the film , stating that the film 's storyline was written during the Vietnam War and was influenced by that conflict rather than the war in Iraq . Lucas did note , however , that " The parallels between Vietnam and what we 're doing in Iraq now are unbelievable " .

 Post the release of Revenge of the Sith — the completion of the original and prequel Star Wars series — on June 9 , 2005 , George Lucas was presented with the 33rd American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award . The institute honored his " astonishing contributions to the art and technology of filmmaking , as well as the impact of the epic Star Wars series " . 
 Despite being the prequel trilogy 's best reviewed and received film , it received fewer award nominations than the previous films . It became the only Star Wars film not to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects ; however , it was nominated for Best Makeup ( Dave Elsey and Nikki <unk> ) , losing to The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe . It also won " Favorite Motion Picture " and " Favorite Dramatic Motion Picture " awards at the People 's Choice Awards , " Hollywood Movie of the Year " award at the Hollywood Film Festival , Empire Awards ( Sci @-@ Fi / Fantasy Film ) , and the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie - Action . It also was nominated for Best Score Soundtrack Album at the 48th Grammy Awards in 2006 . 
 As every film of the original trilogy , the film won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film . Williams also won Best Music . The film was nominated for ten Saturn Awards overall , including Best Director and Best Writing for Lucas , Best Actor for Christensen , Best Actress for Natalie Portman and Best Supporting Actor for Ian McDiarmid . 
 The film did , however , receive the fewest Golden Raspberry Awards nominations : only one , for Christensen as Worst Supporting Actor , which he won . ( The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones received seven nominations each , with one and two wins , respectively . ) It is the only Star Wars prequel not to receive a Razzie nomination for " Worst Picture " . Christensen further won the " Best Villain " award at the MTV Movie Awards . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Throughout Revenge of the Sith , Lucas refers to a wide range of films and other sources , drawing on political , military , and mythological motifs to enhance his story 's impact . Perhaps the most media coverage was given to a particular exchange between Anakin and Obi @-@ Wan , which led to the aforementioned controversy : " If you 're not with me , then you 're my enemy " , Anakin declares . Despite Lucas ' insistence to the contrary , The Seattle Times concluded , " Without naming Bush or the Patriot Act , it 's all unmistakable no matter what your own politics may be . " 
 McDiarmid , Lucas , and others have also called Anakin 's journey to the dark side Faustian in the sense of making a " pact with the devil " for short @-@ term gain , with the fiery volcano planet Mustafar representing hell . Midway through the film , Lucas intercuts between Anakin and Padmé by themselves , thinking about one another in the Jedi Temple and their apartment , respectively , during sunset . The sequence is without dialog and complemented by a moody , synthesized soundtrack . Lucas ' coverage of the exterior cityscapes , skylines and interior isolation in the so @-@ called " Ruminations " sequence is similar to the cinematography and mise @-@ en @-@ scène of Rosemary 's Baby , a film in which a husband makes a literal pact with the devil . 
 As with the previous film and its allusions to The Empire Strikes Back , some deliberately placed references have been made to draw allusions with Return of the Jedi . The title is similar in style to the original planned " Revenge of the Jedi " . Some dialog is mirrored in both films especially the line " I can feel your anger ! " spoken by Palpatine , who also orders his personal entourage / bodyguards to " Leave us " at important moments in both films . Darth Vader attempts to play on Luke 's fear of loss by taunting him with threats against Leia . His own fear of the loss of Padme is what draws him to the dark side . Prior to settling on the Ewoks as the main helpers , the Wookiee race was originally planned to be in Jedi .

 = = = Novelization = = = 
 The film 's novelization was written by Matthew Stover . It includes much more dialogue than the film , including : a conversation between Count Dooku and Darth Sidious , where the reader learns Palpatine lied to Dooku about what the Empire would truly be ; a conversation between Mace Windu and Obi @-@ Wan Kenobi where Obi @-@ Wan expresses self @-@ doubt about whether he is the right Jedi to battle General Grievous ; and a conversation between Anakin and Palpatine in which Palpatine promises to give Anakin anything he wants — whether it be a new speeder or the star system <unk> . The novel includes many minor details . For example , during the Battle of Coruscant , Anakin 's callsign is Red 5 , a reference to Luke 's callsign in the climactic battle of A New Hope , and one of the Republic capital ships is commanded by Lieutenant Commander <unk> Needa , who becomes Captain Needa in The Empire Strikes Back . There are also references to the Star Wars : Republic comic book series , such as the Battle of <unk> ( Volume 3 ) . In addition to this , the siege of the Jedi Temple is much more violent and far more graphically explained than the cinematic version . 
 Some unseen or unheard @-@ of elements of the story were fleshed out in the course of the novel . Such examples include more discussions between Anakin and Palpatine , in which Palpatine explicitly says that Darth Plagueis was his master ; in the film , it is merely hinted at . Additionally , it is revealed that the primary reason for Anakin 's outrage over not becoming a Jedi Master is that only Masters have access to the <unk> in the Temple Archives , which is where Anakin had hoped to find information about how to prevent Padme 's death . Not only is <unk> <unk> revealed to be a telepath , but his horn , lost in the Clone Wars , is revealed to have grown back . The book explains that Palpatine purposely manipulated the Council into sending Obi @-@ Wan to fight General Grievous , because he knew he needed to get Obi @-@ Wan off Coruscant before he could turn Anakin to the dark side . The novel also reveals Mace Windu 's rationale for not bringing Anakin along to the fight with Palpatine : he can sense Anakin 's fear and distress , and does not believe the young Jedi is in any mental state to fight a Sith Lord . These are a few examples of many descriptions of characters ' feelings and inner narrative . There are even some humorous lines added in , including extra dialogue in the battle between Grievous and Obi Wan - Grievous says , " I was trained by Count Dooku , " and Obi @-@ Wan replies , " What a coincidence ; I trained the man who killed him . "

 A video game based on the film was released on May 5 , 2005 , two weeks before the film . The game followed the film 's storyline for the most part , integrating scenes from the film . However , many sections of the game featured scenes cut from the film , or entirely new scenes for the game . The style of the game was mostly lightsaber combat and fighting as Obi @-@ Wan or Anakin . It also has a form of multiplayer mode , which includes both " VS " and " Cooperative " mode . In the first mode , two players fight with characters of their choice against each other in a lightsaber duel to the death . In the latter mode , two players team up to combat increasingly difficult waves of enemies . 
 = Halo : Ghosts of Onyx = 
 Halo : Ghosts of Onyx is a military science fiction novel by Eric Nylund , based on the Halo series of video games . The book was released in October 2006 and is the fourth Halo novel ; Nylund 's third contribution to the series . Onyx was also the first of three Halo novels to be published by Tor Books , rather than the previous publisher , Del Rey . 
 Ghosts of Onyx details the creation of a group of supersoldiers known as the SPARTAN @-@ IIIs to defend humanity against the alien collective known as the Covenant . After the events of Halo 2 , the SPARTAN 's training world of Onyx is beset by robotic attackers . The SPARTANs and their trainers must fight the robots and the Covenant as they work to uncover the planet 's secrets . 
 Upon release , Ghosts of Onyx garnered generally positive reviews . The novel debuted on The New York Times bestseller list and became an international bestseller . 
 = = Background and writing = = 
 Ghosts of Onyx author Eric Nylund had previously written two of the three past Halo novels , The Fall of Reach and First Strike , and went to Halo 's developer Bungie with an outline of what he wanted to do next . According to Nylund , Bungie gave him room to write the story as long as he accomplished some " very specific [ story ] goals " , sometimes making changes to the Halo universe to incorporate his ideas . However , he acknowledged the difficulty of fitting his story into the rest of the Halo universe was far greater for Ghosts of Onyx than the other novels as more of the story had been made public and was no longer able to be modified . Nylund mentioned in an interview with IGN that writing a Halo novel had both its positive aspects and drawbacks . " It 's better because I have all these great toys and characters to play with , " Nylund stated in an interview , " It 's not so good because I have to work and play well with other parts of the intellectual property so everything meshes . " 
 Ghosts of Onyx , originally known as Ghosts of Coral , was the first Halo novel to be published by Tor Books instead of Del Rey . Nylund had 15 weeks to write the book , as opposed to the 7 weeks for The Fall of Reach , but he claimed he still " lost sleep ... ate a bunch of chocolate and drank too much coffee . " Tor 's editors also had more time than those of Del Rey and helped " untangle " the complicated plot of Onyx . On writing , Nylund pointed out that " tension is the cornerstone of any good story " , and that Ghosts of Onyx would be no different . 
 IGN 's reviewer , Douglass C. Perry , found that by using short paragraphs and many jumps in time " [ the novel 's ] style of writing keeps the pace going , even when nothing much is going on . " This technique is used deliberately by Nylund to hasten the pace to avoid " fatiguing the reader and losing them . "

 = = = Plot summary = = = 
 The story begins with a group of SPARTAN @-@ IIIs being deployed to a Covenant fleet refueling depot in the year <unk> . The soldiers destroy the facility , but all save two of the three hundred SPARTANs are killed . The narrative then moves back to 2531 , where SPARTAN @-@ IIs are deployed against human insurrectionists ; though the team is almost captured , the timely intervention of Kurt @-@ 051 allows the team to complete their mission . Meanwhile , Colonel James Ackerson meets with the Office of Naval Intelligence ( ONI ) . Ackerson announces his plan to create a new breed of SPARTANs which retains much of the supersoldiers ' effectiveness , without the high price tag of the SPARTAN @-@ II program . These SPARTAN @-@ IIIs are trained by Franklin Mendez , as well as Kurt @-@ 051 . With his death staged by ONI , Kurt @-@ 051 is placed in full charge of SPARTAN @-@ III training , under the name and rank of Lieutenant Kurt Ambrose . The SPARTAN @-@ III project is carried out on a secret ONI planet named Onyx , where there is also an archaeological excavation of ancient Forerunner ruins in an area known as " Zone 67 " . When a company of SPARTAN @-@ IIIs goes missing in Zone 67 , it is declared off @-@ limits to all personnel . 
 Like the SPARTAN @-@ IIs , the SPARTAN @-@ III candidates undergo radical cybernetic and biological enhancements and are outfitted with special armor to increase their abilities . The first SPARTAN @-@ III company proves highly successful , but is wiped out when ordered to destroy a Covenant orbital shipyard in <unk> . Shaken by the massacre of his troops , Kurt improves the training regimen for his next batch of SPARTAN @-@ III recruits , but they too are all killed in action so Kurt , in an effort to reduce casualties , institutes illegal biological modifications on the third company of SPARTANs . While conducting a training exercise near Zone 67 , UNSC personnel find themselves under attack by alien robotic drones . 
 Meanwhile , Dr. Catherine Halsey , the SPARTAN @-@ II project 's creator , along with the SPARTAN Kelly @-@ 087 arrive in the Onyx system . As they near the surface of the planet they are attacked by more robot drones and crash , meeting up with the human survivors of the attacks . Halsey identifies the robotic drones as Forerunner Sentinels from the artificial intelligence Cortana 's logs of the events of Halo : Combat Evolved . Halsey sends a message back to Earth , which is under attack by Covenant ; in response , Lord Hood sends the SPARTAN @-@ IIs Fred @-@ 104 , Linda @-@ 058 , and Will @-@ 043 to Onyx . 
 At the Forerunner ringworld Delta Halo , the Covenant are in the midst of a civil war . Elites intercept Halsey 's distress signal and learn of the existence of Onyx and its Forerunner technology . Both the Covenant and the UNSC forces which arrive at Onyx are attacked by Sentinels . The entire UNSC fleet at Onyx is destroyed by the ensuing battle , save for one stealth ship , the Dusk , which stays hidden , observing the events . 
 The remaining human forces on Onyx discover a Forerunner city being rapidly uncovered by the Sentinels , and are guided into a massive sphere by Dr. Halsey . She determines that the entire planet is actually a " Shield World " constructed by the Forerunners to protect themselves from the firing of the Halo ringworlds , which are designed to eradicate all sentient life . Fighting off Covenant pursuers , the humans discover an entrance leading to a Dyson Sphere . Kurt remains behind in order to detonate two nuclear weapons to stop the Covenant from following the humans into the Sphere . Hiding at a distance from Onyx , the Dusk watches as Onyx 's surface rips apart to reveal that the entire world is constructed of Sentinels , all connected together to provide an impenetrable defense around the Dyson Sphere at the heart of the planet . The Sentinels annihilate the remaining Covenant fleet vessels orbiting the planet and the Prowler retreats .

 IGN gave Ghosts of Onyx good marks , praising Nylund 's writing style and how Onyx managed to tie up many plot threads that were left hanging from both the novels and the games . The publication did note , however , that the Master Chief made only a cameo appearance , and that Ghosts of Onyx is " about the supporting cast of characters " , rather than the heroes of the video game . Offering a less positive outlook on the book were publications like <unk> , which blasted the novel as being much worse than Halo : First Strike , introducing characters the reader didn 't care about and using too much jargon . The reviewer stated that " It 's a good book . Honest . It just doesn 't measure up to the standard set by the other books in the series . " In response to complaints about typographical errors , Nylund responded that a reprint of the book fixing these issues would appear . 
 Ghosts of Onyx debuted as The New York Times bestseller , remaining on the list for eleven weeks . The novel would go on to become an international bestseller ; a mass @-@ market paperback would be released on April 7 , 2007 . 
 = William Harper ( Rhodesian politician ) = 
 William John Harper ( 22 July 1916 – 8 September 2006 ) was a politician , general contractor and Royal Air Force fighter pilot who served as a Cabinet minister in Rhodesia ( or Southern Rhodesia ) from 1962 to 1968 , and signed that country 's Unilateral Declaration of Independence ( UDI ) from Britain in 1965 . Born into a prominent Anglo @-@ Indian merchant family in Calcutta , Harper was educated in India and England and joined the RAF in 1937 . He served as an officer throughout the Second World War and saw action as one of " The Few " in the Battle of Britain , during which he was wounded in action . Appalled by Britain 's granting of independence to India in 1947 , he emigrated to Rhodesia on retiring from the air force two years later . 
 Harper contended that British rule in the subcontinent should never have ended , and took a similar stance regarding his adopted homeland , reportedly declaring that it , South Africa and the neighbouring Portuguese territories would " be under white rule forever " . He entered politics with the Dominion Party in 1958 and became Minister of Irrigation , Roads and Road Traffic in the Rhodesian Front ( RF ) government in 1962 . The head of a far @-@ right group within the RF , he called for Rhodesia to abolish black representation in parliament and adopt " a form of political apartheid " . When the Prime Minister Winston Field resigned in 1964 , Harper was a front @-@ runner to succeed him , but lost out to Ian Smith , who moved him to the Ministry of Internal Affairs . 
 Each breakdown or setback during the early years of Smith 's premiership prompted press speculation that Harper might replace him . In 1966 , when Smith brought a working document back from the HMS Tiger talks with the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson , Harper led opposition to the terms in Cabinet , contributing to their rejection . Harper resigned from the Rhodesian Front in 1968 , soon after Smith dismissed him from the Cabinet , reportedly because Harper had had an extramarital affair with a British agent . He subsequently became a vocal critic of the Prime Minister , greeting each step Smith made towards settlement with black nationalists during the Bush War with public indignation . By the time majority rule began in Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979 , following the Internal Settlement of the previous year , Harper had left for South Africa . He died in 2006 at the age of 90 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 William John Harper was born on 22 July 1916 in Calcutta , British India , scion of an old and prominent Anglo @-@ Indian merchant family that had been based in the subcontinent for generations , working with the East India Company during the 18th and 19th centuries . He was educated at North Point in Darjeeling , India , and in the English town of Windsor . He grew into a short but tough man who spoke with clipped diction . Nathan <unk> wrote of him in 1966 that " his tight mouth rarely relaxes into a smile , so ... he seems always on the point of losing his temper " . 
 = = Second World War ; Royal Air Force pilot = = 
 Harper joined the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) in 1937 , and was commissioned as an acting pilot officer on 5 September . He was promoted to flying officer on 12 February 1940 , and attached to No. 17 Squadron . On 18 May 1940 he shared in the destruction of a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter , and a week later he destroyed a Ju 87 " Stuka " dive bomber . He was appointed B Flight commander , with the rank of acting flight lieutenant , on 26 May . He destroyed another Bf 110 over Dunkirk three days later , during the evacuation of Allied forces , and continued as flight commander until 8 June 1940 , reverting to the rank of flying officer . He was again promoted to acting flight lieutenant on 4 July , when he was given command of A Flight . 
 From July 1940 , still flying with No. 17 Squadron , Harper was one of " The Few " , the Allied pilots of the Battle of Britain . On 11 August he shared in the probable destruction of a Bf 110 and damaged a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter . Four days later , after taking off as part of a group of six Hawker Hurricanes assigned to intercept more than 20 Luftwaffe aircraft , Harper contacted the German planes alone and probably destroyed a Bf 109 before being shot down . He crash @-@ landed in a field near the Suffolk seaside town of Felixstowe , and convalesced in hospital there with wounds to his face and leg . He soon rejoined No. 17 Squadron and continued his command of A Flight from the ground — he returned to the skies on 1 November 1940 . A week later he destroyed a Ju 87 and probably another . Harper received the war substantive rank of flight lieutenant on 12 February 1941 . A month later he was posted to No. 57 Operational Training Unit RAF , based at RAF Hawarden in Wales , as an instructor . 
 In September 1941 , Harper was seconded to the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) to command No. 453 Squadron RAAF , which was based at Singapore and operated Brewster Buffalo fighters . After suffering heavy losses during the Malayan Campaign in December , No. 453 Squadron was temporarily amalgamated with another Buffalo unit , No. 21 Squadron RAAF , to form No. 21 / 453 Squadron under Harper 's command . By February 1942 , No. 453 Squadron was denuded of aircraft and its remaining personnel were evacuated to Australia . Harper assumed command of No. 135 Squadron RAF in India in April 1942 . In January 1943 he took command of No. 92 ( East India ) Squadron RAF in North Africa , and was promoted to temporary squadron leader with seniority backdated to March 1942 . He was transferred to England in September 1943 and commanded the University Air Squadron at Leeds until 1944 . He remained with the RAF following the end of hostilities .

 Harper was appalled when Britain made India independent in 1947 — he held that the British government had unnecessarily caved in to Indian nationalist demands and should have continued in the subcontinent indefinitely . He retained this view for years afterwards . He retired from the RAF in April 1949 with the rank of wing commander , and the same year emigrated to Southern Rhodesia , a British colony in southern Africa that had been self @-@ governing since 1923 . He settled in the central town of Gatooma , where he farmed , mined and set up an earth @-@ moving contractor 's business . In 1953 , Southern Rhodesia became a territory of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland alongside Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland . Each territory retained its own political status and government , and Southern Rhodesia 's constitutional status was unaltered . 
 = = = Dominion Party = = = 
 Harper entered politics when he contested the Gatooma seat in the 1958 general election , running for the opposition Dominion Party ( which called for full " dominion " or Commonwealth realm status ) . The Southern Rhodesian electoral system allowed only those who met certain financial and educational qualifications to vote — the criteria were applied equally regardless of race , but since most black citizens did not meet the set standards , the electoral roll and colonial Legislative Assembly were overwhelmingly drawn from the white minority ( about 5 % of the population ) . Harper won in Gatooma with 717 out of 1 @,@ 300 votes . Holding strongly conservative views , he soon became seen as the voice of the party 's right wing . He was elected president of the Dominion Party 's Southern Rhodesian arm in October 1959 , and by 1960 he was the official Leader of the Opposition in the Southern Rhodesian parliament . 
 Amid decolonisation and the Wind of Change , the Federation was looking ever more tenuous and the idea of " no independence before majority rule " was gaining considerable ground in British political circles . Harper called for Southern Rhodesia to abandon the Federation and " go it alone " . In June 1960 he and the Southern Rhodesian branch of the Dominion Party adopted the policy of " Southern Rhodesia first " , prompting strong protests from the party 's Northern Rhodesian division ; the Dominion Party splintered into separate Federal and territorial entities a month later . When black nationalist riots broke out in the townships in October 1960 , Harper condemned the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Sir Edgar Whitehead and the governing United Federal Party ( UFP ) as too lenient on the protesters , and argued that giving concessions following political violence would make black Rhodesians believe that " trouble pays dividends " . Arguing against black representation in the Legislative Assembly , he said that if there were black MPs " they will share the restaurant with us and they will share the bars with us . We will be living cheek by jowl with them , and what sort of legislation can the people of this country expect when we ourselves are being conditioned to living cheek by jowl with Africans ? " 
 = = = Rhodesian Front = = = 
 In 1962 Harper was a founding member of the Rhodesian Front ( RF ) , an alliance of conservative voices centred around the former Dominion Party and defectors from the UFP . The party 's declared goal was independence for Southern Rhodesia without radical constitutional change and without any set timetable for the introduction of majority rule . After the RF won a surprise victory in the November 1962 general election — Harper comfortably retained his seat in Gatooma , and elsewhere the country 's first black MPs were elected — the new Prime Minister Winston Field made him Minister of Irrigation , Roads and Road Traffic in the new government . Over the next few years , Harper became one of the main agitators in the Cabinet for a unilateral declaration of independence ( UDI ) ; equating Southern Rhodesia to India , he saw this as a way to prevent a repeat of " the same mistake " . 
 The RF grew dissatisfied with Field during late 1963 and early 1964 because of his failure to win independence on Federal dissolution at the end of 1963 . Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland , by contrast , were both independent under black majority governments within a year , respectively renamed Zambia and Malawi . Harper , who had been assigned the additional portfolios of Transport and Power in November 1963 , was one of two frontrunners to replace Field . The other was the Deputy Prime Minister Ian Smith , formerly of the UFP , who was also Minister of the Treasury . Harper , described in The Spectator as " an ambitious politician and single @-@ minded upholder of white supremacy " , was generally considered the more hardline choice , and the man more likely to go through with UDI . When the Cabinet forced Field to resign in April 1964 , it was Smith who was nominated by the ministers to become the new Prime Minister . Accepting the premiership , Smith reshuffled the Cabinet a few days later and moved Harper to the Ministry of Internal Affairs . Harper was deeply disappointed not to have succeeded Field . 
 As Minister of Internal Affairs , Harper oversaw the indaba ( conference ) of chiefs and headmen at <unk> in October 1964 , at the end of which the tribal leaders unanimously announced their support for the government 's line on independence . He continued to be linked with the premiership . During Smith 's negotiations with the British government , each breakdown or setback was accompanied by speculation in Rhodesia ( " Southern " was dropped in late 1964 ) that Harper might step up to take his place . As the dispute with Britain intensified and white Rhodesians clamoured for independence , Harry Franklin reported in The Spectator in August 1965 that if Smith proved unwilling to go through with UDI , " it is widely believed that ... Harper will emerge from the wings , no longer an understudy , to dare what Mr Smith dare not " . Harper was one of four ministers chosen by Smith to accompany him to London for talks in October 1965 , the others being John Wrathall ( Finance ) , Desmond Lardner @-@ Burke ( Justice ) and the Deputy Minister of Information P K van der Byl . Agreement was not reached and a month later , on 11 November 1965 , Smith and his Cabinet declared Rhodesia independent . 
 At the time of UDI , Harper reportedly kept a map of southern Africa on the wall of his office , on which he had coloured South Africa , South @-@ West Africa , Rhodesia , Mozambique south of the Zambezi and Angola red ; he told visitors that " the red area will be under white rule forever " . While insisting that Rhodesia would continue regardless of international opinion , he publicly demonised the UK government , describing it in January 1966 as " an enemy ... [ that ] must be brought down " . He also vilified black nationalist guerrilla fighters opposed to the Rhodesian government , calling them " gangs of terrorists " and " criminals " . Comments such as these helped to cement Harper 's reputation as a hardline right @-@ winger and rival to Smith 's leadership . The strong personalities of Harper and other ministers such as the Duke of Montrose ( generally known in Rhodesia by his former title Lord Graham ) were perceived by the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his compatriots as a great influence on Smith 's political decision @-@ making , an opinion also expressed by Harper himself . 
 Although Harper was considered an intelligent and capable minister by peers and reporters — a 1965 report in The Economist called him " by far the best brain " in the Rhodesian Cabinet — his views were often perceived as overly reactionary . He led a phalanx of far @-@ right voices within the RF calling for " a form of political apartheid " in Rhodesia , and while the party line was gradual advancement of black political representation , Harper called not only for the cessation of such moves , but for the abolition of black MPs altogether . He thus became something of an obstacle to an Anglo @-@ Rhodesian settlement . Indeed , when Smith brought a working document back from the HMS Tiger talks with Wilson in October 1966 , it was Harper who led opposition to the terms in Cabinet , contributing to its ultimate rejection . Harper considered himself to have been overlooked when Smith gave the office of Deputy Prime Minister ( which had been vacant since UDI ) to the more moderate Wrathall the month before the Tiger conference . The South African newspaper Die <unk> reported in December 1966 that the RF 's right wing was poised to oust Smith in favour of Harper , but this did not occur . 
 = = = Resignation = = = 
 On 4 July 1968 , Harper resigned from the Cabinet at Smith 's request . He was the first minister to be dismissed during Smith 's premiership . The government released a statement explaining that Harper had been removed " for reasons entirely unrelated to differences of opinion over constitutional or other political issues " , and saying simply that Harper had been deemed " a security risk " . Harper publicly claimed that he had been fired for political reasons and because of the threat he posed to Smith 's leadership . Smith was reticent but told reporters he was prepared to tell " the whole sorry tale " if Harper wished . 
 According to the memoirs of Ken Flower , then the director of Rhodesia 's Central Intelligence Organisation ( CIO ) , Harper 's downfall was the result of an extramarital affair with a young secretary in the Rhodesian civil service who the CIO discovered was an agent for MI6 . Flower informed Smith of this on 3 July and the Prime Minister demanded Harper 's resignation that afternoon ; Harper acquiesced the next day . Because this was kept secret ( presuming it is true ) , Harper 's sudden departure from the Cabinet was interpreted by many observers at the time as the culmination of the personal and political rivalry between Smith and Harper , or the result of disagreements over the new constitution . 
 Harper officially resigned his parliament seat and left the Rhodesian Front on 11 July 1968 . Wilson publicly welcomed his departure as a " step in the right direction " , prompting a retort from Smith that he did not appoint or sack ministers to please the British government . Smith said that Harper had been depicted as more extreme than he really was , and denied that he had obstructed a settlement . In retrospect , Smith said he had been glad to be rid of Harper , who he considered underhand and devious . Harper ignored an approach from the ultra @-@ right @-@ wing Rhodesian National Party , offering the leadership , and for a time withdrew from public affairs . Montrose and the ministers A P Smith and Phillip van Heerden briefly threatened to follow Harper out of the government , but backed down within a few days . After a fresh dispute Montrose resigned on 11 September 1968 in protest against Smith 's proposed constitutional and racial policies , which he deemed too liberal . A week later the RF 's Albert Mells easily won the by @-@ election to fill Harper 's former seat in Gatooma . 
 = = = Later career = = = 
 By the time of the July 1974 general election , amid the Bush War , Harper had formed a small bloc of independents called the " Harper Group " . In an attempt to co @-@ ordinate opposition to the Rhodesian Front , the group made an election agreement with the Rhodesia Party ( RP ) , which had been formed two years earlier ; according to The Bulletin it was " seriously hampered by lack of established leadership " but nevertheless " the only real resistance [ to the RF ] in the polls " . Shortly before election day , Harper told a meeting of 300 people that under the present system , which was geared to eventually bring parity between black and white Rhodesians , racial tension would increase and " the white man will be forced out of the country " . He said that while he was not prepared to let black Rhodesians take control of the government , he understood that some form of power @-@ sharing between the races was imperative to the country 's future . The RF won all 50 white roll seats , denying the RP any representation in parliament ; Harper himself lost decisively in the southern Salisbury constituency of Hatfield . 
 By the end of 1974 , Harper had formed the United Conservative Party , which called for separate black and white legislatures . He subsequently reacted with revulsion each time Smith moved towards settlement with black nationalist factions . In December that year he described Smith 's announcement of a ceasefire in the run @-@ up to the Victoria Falls Conference as a " ghastly capitulation " . In 1976 , when Smith announced his acceptance of unconditional majority rule by 1978 , Harper accused the Prime Minister of " selling us out " . " The mind boggles at the enormous impertinence and audacity of this man Smith , " he said . 
 In December 1975 , two months after the disappearance of the prominent lawyer and black nationalist leader Edison Sithole from the middle of Salisbury , along with his secretary Miriam <unk> , Harper stepped forward claiming that the Rhodesian state had kidnapped them . In what became known as the " Harper Memorandum " , the ex @-@ minister stated that Special Branch had interrogated Sithole at <unk> prison and then shuttled him between holding points around the country . The Rhodesian government denied that it was holding Sithole , adding that he was not under any form of restriction . Sithole and <unk> were never seen again , and their fate has never been explained . 
 = = Emigration to South Africa and death = = 
 Smith and non @-@ militant nationalists agreed what became the Internal Settlement in March 1978 , and in January the following year whites backed the new majority rule constitution by 85 % in a national referendum . Multiracial elections were held in April 1979 with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia afterwards . By this time Harper had already left the country ; The Guardian reported shortly before the elections that he was " already settled in South Africa " . Zimbabwe Rhodesia , with Bishop Abel Muzorewa as Prime Minister , failed to win international acceptance and following the Lancaster House Agreement of December 1979 , the UK oversaw a process leading to fresh elections in which the guerrilla leader Robert Mugabe was elected Prime Minister . Britain granted independence to the country as Zimbabwe in April 1980 . Harper died on 8 September 2006 , at the age of 90 .

 Stephen Cox Newton ( 21 April 1853 – 16 August 1916 ) was an English cricketer who represented , and captained , Somerset County Cricket Club in the late 19th century . During a 14 @-@ year first @-@ class cricket career , he also represented Cambridge University , Middlesex and the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) . 
 He made his debut in first @-@ class cricket for Cambridge University , where he was awarded his Blue . He then spent nine seasons playing for Somerset , and captained the side for the last five of those seasons . Working as a schoolmaster at Highgate School in London from 1876 – 1884 , his playing opportunities for the south @-@ western county were limited , and from 1885 he only played first @-@ class cricket at Lord 's cricket ground , representing Middlesex in three matches that season , and appearing for the MCC on nine occasions over six years . He returned to play for Somerset in 1887 and 1890 when they had lost their first @-@ class status . He worked as headmaster of Loudon House School in London for some years from 1888 , and died following an operation in 1916 in Ipswich . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Stephen Cox Newton was born on 21 April 1853 in Nailsea , Somerset to Robert Newton and Elizabeth Catherine Cox . He attended Victoria College , Jersey , where he played in the school cricket team for seven summers , from 1866 to 1872 , and topped the batting averages in five of those years ( 1867 , 1868 , 1869 , 1870 , and 1872 ) . He also captained the side during his last three years at the school . 
 On completion of his time at Victoria College , Newton continued his education at Cambridge University , attending Corpus Christi College . He played in the Freshman 's match in 1873 , in which made scores of two and twelve and took two wickets . A report in the Cambridge Independent Press concluded that very few of the players competing showed promise , and that they would " be surprised if more than two will be awarded their Blues " . Accordingly , Newton was not selected for the University team until final year at Cambridge . Despite this , he appeared a number of times during the summer vacation , known at Cambridge as the " long vacation " , for the eponymous Cambridge Long Vacation Club , captaining the team in 1875 . 
 He played five first @-@ class matches for the university , all in 1876 . His highest score during these matches was the 33 not out that he scored in the second innings of his first @-@ class debut , against an England XI . He was awarded his cricketing Blue , scoring seven runs at number ten during a nine wicket Cambridge victory over Oxford University .

 = = = Pre @-@ first @-@ class years = = = 
 Newton assisted Somerset from 1876 until 1890 . The county cricket club had only been formally set @-@ up the previous year , and was seeking first @-@ class status . The majority of matches played by Newton for the county between 1876 and 1878 are recorded by CricketArchive as being for the ' Gentlemen of Somerset ' , and are not categorised as first @-@ class cricket , and although those from 1879 onwards are recorded as being for ' Somerset ' , they are generally regarded as remaining a ' second @-@ class ' of cricket . 
 During these pre @-@ first @-@ class seasons , Newton made a name for himself , and in his official history of the club , Peter Roebuck describes him as one of the talents of the side . He took on the captaincy of the club in 1880 , a season in which he passed 30 runs in five of the recorded seven innings in which he played . His highest score recorded on CricketArchive during these years for Somerset was the 91 which he scored in 1876 against the Gentlemen of Dorset . Team @-@ mate Bill Roe described Newton as a useful batsman who favoured playing balls on his pads . In his obituary , Newton was described as being " a most excellent field " , particularly strong at cover @-@ point , while Haygarth 's Scores and Biographies characterised him as " a fine and free hitter , and a most excellent field " . He was the county 's top run @-@ scorer in 1877 , accumulating 285 runs at an average of 25 @.@ 90 , and he was also one of their principle bowlers , collecting 21 wickets during the season . He remained near the top of the batting charts for the club the following year , scoring the second @-@ most runs behind Edward Sainsbury , 146 at an average of 18 @.@ 25 . He was used less as a bowler than in the previous year , taking just six wickets . He once again trailed only Sainsbury amongst batsmen in 1880 , scoring 278 runs at an average of 30 @.@ 88 . He was appointed as the club captain for 1881 , though he was not able to play as frequently for the club , and finished the season with 93 runs from five innings at an average of 18 @.@ 3 . 
 = = = First @-@ class cricket = = = 
 Somerset gained first @-@ class status in 1882 , and retained it for four seasons . Newton was the club captain for the first three of these seasons , becoming the county 's first official captain . He did not , however , appear in Somerset 's first three matches : as a schoolmaster in London , he only played for the county in late @-@ July and August . In his first match as a first @-@ class cricket captain , he top @-@ scored in both innings , with 57 and 67 , as Somerset lost to MCC by one wicket . He then made 80 in the side 's next match , a victory over Hampshire . He fared less well in the remainder of the 1882 season , failing to reach a half @-@ century in any of his other three matches . Newton 's batting average of 34 @.@ 44 from his five first @-@ class matches in 1882 was the highest he achieved during his first @-@ class career , and both his total number of runs scored ( 310 ) and his number of half @-@ centuries ( 3 ) during the season were also career highs . 
 Newton suffered a slow start to his 1883 campaign , failing to pass 10 runs in his first five innings . His improvements improved in his next three matches , highlighted by a half @-@ century against Gloucestershire , scored during a 135 run partnership with Edward Sainsbury . His batting average for the season was almost half that of the previous year , and despite playing two additional innings he scored two less half @-@ centuries than in 1882 . In his first match for Somerset in 1884 , Newton claimed his only wickets in first @-@ class cricket . Bowling with a style that is not recorded on CricketArchive or Cricinfo , he claimed the wickets of Hampshire 's Arthur Richards and HH Armstrong , both batsmen being caught off his bowling . Newton utilised himself as a bowler only after using every other member of the side , with the exception of wicket @-@ keeper Francis Terry . In his next match , Newton avoided a pair against Lancashire by top @-@ scoring in Somerset 's second innings with 62 . That score was to be the last half @-@ century of Newton 's season , and his last in first @-@ class cricket for Somerset . He added two further scores above 30 against Kent , scoring 46 and 31 , He played three less innings than in the previous season , but surpassed his total runs from that season , and improved his average to 24 @.@ 22 . In his three years of first @-@ class cricket for Somerset , he scored no centuries , five half @-@ centuries , and averaged 24 @.@ 56 with the bat , higher than he finished with any other first @-@ class cricket side .

 From the 1885 season , all of Newton 's first @-@ class appearances were made for either Middlesex or the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) at Lord 's cricket ground in St John 's Wood , London . Having been a member of the MCC since 1878 , Newton made his debut for the club in first @-@ class competition against Nottinghamshire in May 1885 . He appeared for the club five times during 1885 . In contrast to his time at Somerset , he did not restrict himself to playing only during late @-@ July and August . Playing for the side against Lancashire , Newton made his highest total in first @-@ class cricket , scoring 86 in the second @-@ innings of the match . This score was the only half @-@ century that Newton scored for a side other than Somerset . Newton appeared three times for Middlesex during 1885 , for whom he qualified under the residential criterion . He averaged 5 @.@ 33 for the county with the bat , and did not appear again after 1885 . He appeared once for the MCC in first @-@ class cricket in each of the 1887 , 1888 , 1889 and 1890 seasons , after which he did not play first @-@ class cricket again . His final first @-@ class match was in May 1890 when he scored 1 and 21 during a seven wicket loss to Lancashire .

 Newton returned to play three further matches for Somerset in 1887 and 1890 , when they did not hold first @-@ class status . He opened the innings for the county twice in 1887 , passing 20 on three out of four occasions . During Somerset 's successful 1890 season , when they remained unbeaten against other county opposition , Newton batted at number four , scoring 3 and 0 , his final recorded appearance for Somerset . CricketArchive records one further appearance for Newton , playing in Felixstowe for the MCC against Suffolk in 1905 , aged 52 . Opening the batting , he scored 87 to help his side to a nine wicket victory .

 The Hillsboro Civic Center is a government @-@ built , mixed @-@ use development in downtown Hillsboro , Oregon , United States . The development includes the city hall for the county seat of Washington County , located west of Portland , Oregon . Covering 6 acres ( 24 @,@ 000 m2 ) , the Civic Center has a total of over 165 @,@ 000 square feet ( 15 @,@ 300 m2 ) in the complex . The total of six stories for the main structure makes the building the tallest in the city , tied with Tuality Community Hospital . In addition to government offices , the Civic Center includes retail space , public plazas , and residential housing . The complex was built to centralize city government functions under one roof . 
 Design of the complex began in 2002 , with construction beginning in 2003 . After completion in 2005 , the building was awarded the LEED Gold certification for sustainability , the second city hall in the United States to earn that distinction . Environmentally friendly technologies used include occupancy sensors , ventilation that monitors carbon dioxide levels to determine when to activate , high performance exterior glass to reduce heat loss , and solar panels to generate electricity . 
 = = History = = 
 Plans for the 6 @-@ acre ( 24 @,@ 000 m2 ) complex began as part of the city ’ s 2020 comprehensive plan . Development plans from six teams of developers and architects were submitted to the city in October 2001 . These plans included designs for public plazas , a library branch , residential units , retail space , and a new city hall . Formal design proposals were submitted in early 2002 . The project was designed to consolidate city government and to anchor redevelopment of the downtown core that would reinvigorate downtown . This included the plan to turn the area into a zone with 18 hours of activity each day , instead of businesses closing at 5 : 00 pm when the city and county governments closed . Additionally , conference space was planned to accommodate use by both city and county governments , and by private groups . 
 In April 2002 , Specht Properties was selected as the developer of the project after scoring higher with the council appointed committee formed to rate each of three developer 's proposals , with Gerding / <unk> Development and Trammell Crow Company losing out to Specht . Construction on the complex began in June 2003 when an old grain store at the site was demolished to make room for the center . A total of eight buildings were torn down to make room the complex as part of a redevelopment of a brownfield site . 
 Plans also called for retail space , housing units , and a library branch . Though the library section was built , a library branch did not open at the site . LRS Architects designed the complex with Skanska USA serving as the general contractor . The structural engineering was done by <unk> Consulting Engineers , services engineering was completed by Interface Engineering , and civil engineering for the project was handled by <unk> Design . 
 The building was finished in January 2005 with city officials and employees moving into the buildings by the end of March . A public grand opening was held on July 16 , 2005 , to officially open the center . Total cost of the public portion of the project was $ 34 million , with construction totaling $ 23 @.@ 5 million . Prior to completion the city leased space in several downtown buildings , including the county 's Public Services Building where Hillsboro also held city council meetings . Later in 2005 a coffee shop was added as a tenant in part of the retail space , and in 2007 the restaurant space in the building was leased to NW Hayden Enterprises for a restaurant scheduled to open in 2008 . In April 2009 , the plaza was renamed as the Tom Hughes Civic Center Plaza in honor of former mayor Tom Hughes who was mayor when the building was constructed .

 Hillsboro 's Civic Center is a modern glass building with a stone base and brick highlights . There are two main buildings , the Civic Center housing government offices and the Plaza Building housing retail space . The plazas surrounding the structures contain an inlaid quartzite river , basalt planters , and Victorian style benches . Additionally , it was designed with large windows facing the north in order to reflect the giant sequoia trees located across the street at the Washington County Courthouse , with the trees dating back to the 1880s . 
 At a total of six stories tall , the building is tied for the tallest building in Hillsboro with Tuality Community Hospital standing 78 feet ( 24 m ) tall . Inside the building features high ceilings on the first floor and a large , open public space . Daylight and exterior views are present in 90 % of the offices in city hall .

 Hillsboro Civic Center won the award for Best Public Project in the state of Oregon for 2005 from Northwest Construction magazine for the general contractor Skanska USA . It is the first municipal headquarters in Oregon to meet all its energy needs with renewable sources . During development , the project first aimed for attaining a Silver certification from the United States Green Building Council . Instead , the project was awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold certification for environmental sustainability by the U.S. Green Building Council 's Leadership . This was the second Gold rating given to a city hall in the U.S. after Seattle ’ s city hall earned the distinction , and the seventh building in Oregon to earn that level of certification . 
 Contributing factors leading to this award included that during construction , 92 % of construction waste was recycled , and non @-@ wood wheat board was used in some of the walls . Additionally , 18 solar panels were installed on the building to generate power for use in the building , with the city purchasing all additional power through renewable power sources , funded in part by Portland General Electric and the Bonneville Environmental Foundation , while the building is 42 % more energy efficient than comparable buildings . Other environmental friendly amenities include occupancy sensors , ventilation that monitors carbon dioxide levels to determine when to activate , high performance exterior glass to reduce heat loss , infrared bathroom fixtures , and the use of recycled building materials among other items .

 The Civic Center was built over three city blocks in downtown . The complex has a total of 168 @,@ 436 square feet ( 15 @,@ 648 @.@ 2 m2 ) . The complex has two plazas , with the northern plaza designed to create an outdoor amphitheater with seating for 700 . Dedicated as the Tom Hughes Civic Center Plaza , the buildings of the Civic Center serve as a backdrop to the amphitheater , and by using Main Street to increase the space , the amphitheater can accommodate crowds of 5 @,@ 000 people . South Plaza connects the government portions of the complex to the 120 unit residential component of the development to the south . Both plazas have water features , including a fountain in the 24 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 2 @,@ 200 m2 ) North Plaza . 
 On the ground floor is a Starbucks coffee shop in a 1 @,@ 600 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 150 m2 ) space , while the 20 @,@ 000 square feet ( 1 @,@ 900 m2 ) designed for the library branch remain open for future government use . In the government areas there is a 3 @,@ 800 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 350 m2 ) conference center and the city council chambers . This includes a 250 @-@ seat auditorium . The Civic Center hosts the seasonal , weekly farmer ’ s market on Saturdays , and a marketplace on Tuesdays that features various vendors , both utilizing the center ’ s plaza area . Plans call for an upscale restaurant in a 3 @,@ 800 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 350 m2 ) space . City services at the site include the Administration Department , city planning , the office of the city recorder , and the municipal court among others . The Civic Center also houses the office of the mayor and is the site of the twice @-@ monthly city council meetings . 
 = Tropical Depression One ( 1993 ) = 
 Tropical Depression One was a weak tropical cyclone that struck Cuba and the Bahamas in May and June 1993 . It formed in the western Caribbean Sea on May 31 and produced heavy rainfall along its path . In Cuba , the precipitation reached 12 @.@ 4 inches ( 31 @.@ 5 cm ) , which caused widespread flooding and damage in nine provinces . Over 16 @,@ 500 houses were damaged , and a further 1 @,@ 860 were destroyed . At least seven people were killed in the country . In neighboring Haiti , the flooding killed thirteen people , as well as thousands of livestock . Rainfall was also reported in southern Florida , which eased drought conditions . The depression eventually crossed the Bahamas and became extratropical . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of the tropical depression were from a tropical wave that exited the coast of Africa on May 13 . It crossed the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea , reaching a position east of the Yucatan Peninsula by May 25 . The system interacted with a monsoon @-@ type circulation over Central America , and a broad low @-@ level circulation developed near Cozumel , Mexico . Atmospheric pressure in the region fell gradually as the system organized , and on May 31 , the National Hurricane Center classified it as Tropical Depression One near the Isle of Youth . At the time of being upgraded , the circulation was located on the northwest side of the convection due to wind shear . 
 Throughout its duration , the depression maintained a northeast track , due to an approaching shortwave trough to its north . Late on May 31 , the poorly organized center crossed western Cuba , accompanied by heavy rainfall but light winds . By the time the circulation reached the Florida Straits , it was exposed and removed from the convection , although slight intensification was anticipated . The depression accelerated northeastward through the Bahamas , passing near Nassau . Based on Hurricane Hunters observations , it maintained stronger winds in squalls away from the center , and the pressure deepened to 999 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 5 inHg ) . By June 2 , reconnaissance flights into the system had difficulty discerning a circulation . Later that day , the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories , as the depression had become extratropical . It strengthened slightly to reach gale force winds as an extratropical storm , and persisted until early on June 3 . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 In its first advisory on the depression , the National Hurricane Center emphasized the threat for heavy rainfall in Jamaica , Cuba , Haiti , south Florida , and the Bahamas . The agency also advised small craft in Cuba and the Cayman Islands to remain at port . The depression was the first tropical cyclone threat to south Florida since Hurricane Andrew nine months prior , although officials noted the depression 's winds were no cause for concern . 
 The precursor to the disturbance brought locally heavy rainfall to the Yucatán Peninsula , with a maximum of 7 @.@ 09 inches ( 18 cm ) in Lázaro Cárdenas , Quintana Roo . The depression produced intense precipitation across central and eastern Cuba , peaking at 12 @.@ 4 inches ( 31 @.@ 5 cm ) in <unk> de <unk> . In Victoria de Las Tunas , a rainfall total of 8 @.@ 6 inches ( 21 @.@ 8 cm ) set the new record most rainfall in 24 hours . The rainfall caused flooding of rivers and lakes behind dams , and in some places , residents required rescue from the roofs of their houses . Officials forced the evacuation of 40 @,@ 000 people in several provinces , and across the country , the storm destroyed 1 @,@ 860 homes and damaged 16 @,@ 500 more . The flooding blocked mountainous highways in Santiago de Cuba Province , and in Las Tunas Province railway lines were damaged . Widespread crop damage occurred just two months after the Storm of the Century left similar heavy damage . The flooding damaged 87 sugar production centers . The depression killed seven people in the country with another five missing , as reported by a newspaper on the day after the depression left the island . After the storm passed , the Cuban government activated the Civil Defense , while National Relief Services worked to rescue all people affected by the flooding . 
 Elsewhere along its path , heavy rainfall was reported in Jamaica , Hispaniola , and southern Florida . In Haiti , the rainfall caused 13 deaths and left thousands of livestock killed . In Florida , the precipitation peaked at 9 @.@ 99 inches ( 25 @.@ 4 cm ) in Canal Point near Lake Okeechobee . Another high total was 9 @.@ 4 inches ( 23 @.@ 9 cm ) in Tavernier , and the precipitation as a whole alleviated drought conditions . 
 = Abyssal plain = 
 An abyssal plain is an underwater plain on the deep ocean floor , usually found at depths between 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) and 6 @,@ 000 metres ( 20 @,@ 000 ft ) . Lying generally between the foot of a continental rise and a mid @-@ ocean ridge , abyssal plains cover more than 50 % of the Earth ’ s surface . They are among the flattest , smoothest and least explored regions on Earth . Abyssal plains are key geologic elements of oceanic basins ( the other elements being an elevated mid @-@ ocean ridge and flanking abyssal hills ) . In addition to these elements , active oceanic basins ( those that are associated with a moving plate tectonic boundary ) also typically include an oceanic trench and a subduction zone . 
 Abyssal plains were not recognized as distinct physiographic features of the sea floor until the late 1940s and , until very recently , none had been studied on a systematic basis . They are poorly preserved in the sedimentary record , because they tend to be consumed by the subduction process . The creation of the abyssal plain is the end result of spreading of the seafloor ( plate tectonics ) and melting of the lower oceanic crust . Magma rises from above the asthenosphere ( a layer of the upper mantle ) and as this basaltic material reaches the surface at mid @-@ ocean ridges it forms new oceanic crust . This is constantly pulled sideways by spreading of the seafloor . Abyssal plains result from the blanketing of an originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine @-@ grained sediments , mainly clay and silt . Much of this sediment is deposited by turbidity currents that have been channelled from the continental margins along submarine canyons down into deeper water . The remainder of the sediment is composed chiefly of pelagic sediments . Metallic nodules are common in some areas of the plains , with varying concentrations of metals , including manganese , iron , nickel , cobalt , and copper . These nodules may provide a significant resource for future mining ventures . 
 Owing in part to their vast size , abyssal plains are currently believed to be a major reservoir of biodiversity . The abyss also exerts significant influence upon ocean carbon cycling , dissolution of calcium carbonate , and atmospheric CO2 concentrations over timescales of 100 – 1000 years . The structure and function of abyssal ecosystems are strongly influenced by the rate of flux of food to the seafloor and the composition of the material that settles . Factors such as climate change , fishing practices , and ocean fertilization are expected to have a substantial effect on patterns of primary production in the euphotic zone . This will undoubtedly impact the flux of organic material to the abyss in a similar manner and thus have a profound effect on the structure , function and diversity of abyssal ecosystems . 
 = = Oceanic zones = = 
 The ocean can be conceptualized as being divided into various zones , depending on depth , and presence or absence of sunlight . Nearly all life forms in the ocean depend on the photosynthetic activities of phytoplankton and other marine plants to convert carbon dioxide into organic carbon , which is the basic building block of organic matter . Photosynthesis in turn requires energy from sunlight to drive the chemical reactions that produce organic carbon . 
 The stratum of the water column nearest the surface of the ocean ( sea level ) is referred to as the photic zone . The photic zone can be subdivided into two different vertical regions . The uppermost portion of the photic zone , where there is adequate light to support photosynthesis by phytoplankton and plants , is referred to as the euphotic zone ( also referred to as the epipelagic zone , or surface zone ) . The lower portion of the photic zone , where the light intensity is insufficient for photosynthesis , is called the dysphotic zone ( dysphotic means " poorly lit " in Greek ) . The dysphotic zone is also referred to as the mesopelagic zone , or the twilight zone . Its lowermost boundary is at a thermocline of 12 ° C ( 54 ° F ) , which , in the tropics generally lies between 200 and 1000 metres . 
 The euphotic zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as extending from the surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0 @.@ 1 – 1 % of surface sunlight irradiance , depending on season , latitude and degree of water turbidity . In the clearest ocean water , the euphotic zone may extend to a depth of about 150 metres , or rarely , up to 200 metres . Dissolved substances and solid particles absorb and scatter light , and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth . In such areas the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of metres deep or less . The dysphotic zone , where light intensity is considerably less than 1 % of surface irradiance , extends from the base of the euphotic zone to about 1000 metres . Extending from the bottom of the photic zone down to the seabed is the aphotic zone , a region of perpetual darkness . 
 Since the average depth of the ocean is about 4300 metres , the photic zone represents only a tiny fraction of the ocean ’ s total volume . However , due to its capacity for photosynthesis , the photic zone has the greatest biodiversity and biomass of all oceanic zones . Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here . Life forms which inhabit the aphotic zone are often capable of movement upwards through the water column into the photic zone for feeding . Otherwise , they must rely on material sinking from above , or find another source of energy and nutrition , such as occurs in chemosynthetic archaea found near hydrothermal vents and cold seeps . 
 The aphotic zone can be subdivided into three different vertical regions , based on depth and temperature . First is the <unk> zone , extending from a depth of 1000 metres down to 3000 metres , with water temperature decreasing from 12 ° C ( 54 ° F ) to 4 ° C ( 39 ° F ) as depth increases . Next is the abyssal zone , extending from a depth of 3000 metres down to 6000 metres . The final zone includes the deep oceanic trenches , and is known as the hadal zone . This , the deepest oceanic zone , extends from a depth of 6000 metres down to approximately 11000 metres . Abyssal plains are typically located in the abyssal zone , at depths ranging from 3000 to 6000 metres . 
 The table below illustrates the classification of oceanic zones : 
 = = Formation = = 
 Oceanic crust , which forms the bedrock of abyssal plains , is continuously being created at mid @-@ ocean ridges ( a type of divergent boundary ) by a process known as decompression melting . Plume @-@ related decompression melting of solid mantle is responsible for creating ocean islands like the Hawaiian islands , as well as the ocean crust at mid @-@ ocean ridges . This phenomenon is also the most common explanation for flood basalts and oceanic plateaus ( two types of large igneous provinces ) . Decompression melting occurs when the upper mantle is partially melted into magma as it moves upwards under mid @-@ ocean ridges . This upwelling magma then cools and solidifies by conduction and convection of heat to form new oceanic crust . Accretion occurs as mantle is added to the growing edges of a tectonic plate , usually associated with seafloor spreading . The age of oceanic crust is therefore a function of distance from the mid @-@ ocean ridge . The youngest oceanic crust is at the mid @-@ ocean ridges , and it becomes progressively older , cooler and denser as it migrates outwards from the mid @-@ ocean ridges as part of the process called mantle convection . 
 The lithosphere , which rides atop the asthenosphere , is divided into a number of tectonic plates that are continuously being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries . Oceanic crust and tectonic plates are formed and move apart at mid @-@ ocean ridges . Abyssal hills are formed by stretching of the oceanic lithosphere . Consumption or destruction of the oceanic lithosphere occurs at oceanic trenches ( a type of convergent boundary , also known as a destructive plate boundary ) by a process known as subduction . Oceanic trenches are found at places where the oceanic lithospheric slabs of two different plates meet , and the denser ( older ) slab begins to descend back into the mantle . At the consumption edge of the plate ( the oceanic trench ) , the oceanic lithosphere has thermally contracted to become quite dense , and it sinks under its own weight in the process of subduction . The subduction process consumes older oceanic lithosphere , so oceanic crust is seldom more than 200 million years old . The overall process of repeated cycles of creation and destruction of oceanic crust is known as the <unk> cycle , first proposed by Canadian geophysicist and geologist John Tuzo Wilson . 
 New oceanic crust , closest to the mid @-@ oceanic ridges , is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography . The roughness of this topography is a function of the rate at which the mid @-@ ocean ridge is spreading ( the spreading rate ) . Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly . Typical values for fast @-@ spreading ridges are greater than 100 mm / yr , while slow @-@ spreading ridges are typically less than 20 mm / yr . Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate , the rougher the new oceanic crust will be , and vice versa . It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid @-@ ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed . These faults pervading the oceanic crust , along with their bounding abyssal hills , are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth . The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . 
 The flat appearance of mature abyssal plains results from the blanketing of this originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine @-@ grained sediments , mainly clay and silt . Much of this sediment is deposited from turbidity currents that have been channeled from the continental margins along submarine canyons down into deeper water . The remainder of the sediment comprises chiefly dust ( clay particles ) blown out to sea from land , and the remains of small marine plants and animals which sink from the upper layer of the ocean , known as pelagic sediments . The total sediment deposition rate in remote areas is estimated at two to three centimeters per thousand years . Sediment @-@ covered abyssal plains are less common in the Pacific Ocean than in other major ocean basins because sediments from turbidity currents are trapped in oceanic trenches that border the Pacific Ocean . 
 Abyssal plains are typically covered by very deep sea , but during parts of the Messinian salinity crisis much of the Mediterranean Sea 's abyssal plain was exposed to air as an empty hot dry salt @-@ floored sink . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 The landmark scientific expedition ( December 1872 – May 1876 ) of the British Royal Navy survey ship HMS Challenger yielded a tremendous amount of bathymetric data , much of which has been confirmed by subsequent researchers . Bathymetric data obtained during the course of the Challenger expedition enabled scientists to draw maps , which provided a rough outline of certain major submarine terrain features , such as the edge of the continental shelves and the Mid @-@ Atlantic Ridge . This discontinuous set of data points was obtained by the simple technique of taking soundings by lowering long lines from the ship to the seabed . 
 The Challenger expedition was followed by the 1879 – 1881 expedition of the Jeannette , led by United States Navy Lieutenant George Washington DeLong . The team sailed across the Chukchi Sea and recorded meteorological and astronomical data in addition to taking soundings of the seabed . The ship became trapped in the ice pack near Wrangel Island in September 1879 , and was ultimately crushed and sunk in June 1881 . 
 The Jeannette expedition was followed by the 1893 – 1896 Arctic expedition of Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen aboard the Fram , which proved that the Arctic Ocean was a deep oceanic basin , uninterrupted by any significant land masses north of the Eurasian continent . 
 Beginning in 1916 , Canadian physicist Robert William Boyle and other scientists of the Anti @-@ Submarine Detection Investigation Committee ( ASDIC ) undertook research which ultimately led to the development of sonar technology . Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines , thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor ( 1925 – 27 ) to take frequent soundings on east @-@ west Atlantic transects . Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins , but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains . 
 As technology improved , measurement of depth , latitude and longitude became more precise and it became possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points . This allowed researchers to draw accurate and detailed maps of large areas of the ocean floor . Use of a continuously recording fathometer enabled Tolstoy & Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal plain . This plain , located to the south of Newfoundland , is now known as the <unk> Abyssal Plain . Following this discovery many other examples were found in all the oceans . 
 The Challenger Deep is the deepest surveyed point of all of Earth 's oceans ; it is located at the southern end of the Mariana Trench near the Mariana Islands group . The depression is named after HMS Challenger , whose researchers made the first recordings of its depth on 23 March 1875 at station 225 . The reported depth was 4 @,@ 475 fathoms ( <unk> meters ) based on two separate soundings . On 1 June 2009 , sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the Simrad <unk> multibeam sonar bathymetry system aboard the R / V Kilo Moana indicated a maximum depth of <unk> meters ( 6 @.@ 82 miles ) . The sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection , with an accuracy of better than 0 @.@ 2 % of water depth ( this is an error of about 22 meters at this depth ) . 
 = = Terrain features = = 
 = = = Hydrothermal vents = = = 
 A rare but important terrain feature found in the abyssal and hadal zones is the hydrothermal vent . In contrast to the approximately 2 ° C ambient water temperature at these depths , water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60 ° C up to as high as 464 ° C. Due to the high barometric pressure at these depths , water may exist in either its liquid form or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures . 
 At a barometric pressure of 218 atmospheres , the critical point of water is 375 ° C. At a depth of 3 @,@ 000 meters , the barometric pressure of sea water is more than 300 atmospheres ( as salt water is denser than fresh water ) . At this depth and pressure , seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407 ° C ( see image ) . However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point . Thus , water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents , black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid , possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid . 
 Sister Peak ( <unk> Cove Hydrothermal Field , 4 ° 48 ′ S 12 ° 22 ′ W , elevation − <unk> m ) , Shrimp Farm and Mephisto ( Red Lion Hydrothermal Field , 4 ° 48 ′ S 12 ° 23 ′ W , elevation − <unk> m ) , are three hydrothermal vents of the black smoker category , located on the Mid @-@ Atlantic Ridge near Ascension Island . They are presumed to have been active since an earthquake shook the region in 2002 . These vents have been observed to vent phase @-@ separated , vapor @-@ type fluids . In 2008 , sustained exit temperatures of up to 407 ° C were recorded at one of these vents , with a peak recorded temperature of up to 464 ° C. These thermodynamic conditions exceed the critical point of seawater , and are the highest temperatures recorded to date from the seafloor . This is the first reported evidence for direct magmatic @-@ hydrothermal interaction on a slow @-@ spreading mid @-@ ocean ridge . 
 = = = Cold seeps = = = 
 Another unusual feature found in the abyssal and hadal zones is the cold seep , sometimes called a cold vent . This is an area of the seabed where seepage of hydrogen sulfide , methane and other hydrocarbon @-@ rich fluid occurs , often in the form of a deep @-@ sea brine pool . The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983 , at a depth of 3200 meters in the Gulf of Mexico . Since then , cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean , including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay , California , the Sea of Japan , off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica , off the Atlantic coast of Africa , off the coast of Alaska , and under an ice shelf in Antarctica . 
 = = Biodiversity = = 
 Though the plains were once assumed to be vast , desert @-@ like habitats , research over the past decade or so shows that they teem with a wide variety of microbial life . However , ecosystem structure and function at the deep seafloor have historically been very poorly studied because of the size and remoteness of the abyss . Recent oceanographic expeditions conducted by an international group of scientists from the Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life ( CeDAMar ) have found an extremely high level of biodiversity on abyssal plains , with up to 2000 species of bacteria , 250 species of protozoans , and 500 species of invertebrates ( worms , crustaceans and molluscs ) , typically found at single abyssal sites . New species make up more than 80 % of the thousands of seafloor invertebrate species collected at any abyssal station , highlighting our heretofore poor understanding of abyssal diversity and evolution . Richer biodiversity is associated with areas of known <unk> input and higher organic carbon flux . 
 <unk> <unk> , a species of cusk eel in the family <unk> , is among the deepest @-@ living species of fish . In 1970 , one specimen was <unk> from a depth of <unk> meters in the Puerto Rico Trench . The animal was dead , however , upon arrival at the surface . In 2008 , the hadal <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) was observed and recorded at a depth of 7700 meters in the Japan Trench . These are , to date , the deepest living fish ever recorded . Other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the <unk> family , which includes the abyssal <unk> ( Bathypterois longipes ) , <unk> ( Bathypterois grallator ) , feeler fish ( Bathypterois <unk> ) , and the black lizardfish ( <unk> gracilis ) . Some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000 meters . 
 CeDAMar scientists have demonstrated that some abyssal and hadal species have a cosmopolitan distribution . One example of this would be protozoan foraminiferans , certain species of which are distributed from the Arctic to the Antarctic . Other faunal groups , such as the polychaete worms and isopod crustaceans , appear to be endemic to certain specific plains and basins . Many apparently unique taxa of nematode worms have also been recently discovered on abyssal plains . This suggests that the very deep ocean has fostered adaptive radiations . The taxonomic composition of the nematode fauna in the abyssal Pacific is similar , but not identical to , that of the North Atlantic . A list of some of the species that have been discovered or redescribed by CeDAMar can be found here . 
 Eleven of the 31 described species of <unk> ( a class of mollusks ) live below 2000 meters . Of these 11 species , two live exclusively in the hadal zone . The greatest number of monoplacophorans are from the eastern Pacific Ocean along the oceanic trenches . However , no abyssal monoplacophorans have yet been found in the Western Pacific and only one abyssal species has been identified in the Indian Ocean . Of the 922 known species of chitons ( from the Polyplacophora class of mollusks ) , 22 species ( 2 @.@ 4 % ) are reported to live below 2000 meters and two of them are restricted to the abyssal plain . Although genetic studies are lacking , at least six of these species are thought to be <unk> ( capable of living in a wide range of depths ) , having been reported as occurring from the sublittoral to abyssal depths . A large number of the <unk> from great depths are herbivorous or <unk> , which could explain the difference between the distribution of monoplacophorans and <unk> in the world 's oceans . 
 <unk> crustaceans , including isopods , are known to form a significant part of the <unk> community that is responsible for scavenging on large food falls onto the sea floor . In 2000 , scientists of the Diversity of the deep Atlantic benthos ( DIVA 1 ) expedition ( cruise M48 / 1 of the German research vessel RV Meteor III ) discovered and collected three new species of the Asellota suborder of benthic isopods from the abyssal plains of the Angola Basin in the South Atlantic Ocean . In 2003 , De <unk> et al. collected some 68 @,@ 000 <unk> crustaceans from 62 species from baited traps deployed in the Weddell Sea , Scotia Sea , and off the South Shetland Islands . They found that about 98 % of the specimens belonged to the amphipod superfamily <unk> , and 2 % to the isopod family <unk> . Half of these species were collected from depths of greater than 1000 meters . 
 In 2005 , the Japan Agency for Marine @-@ Earth Science and Technology ( JAMSTEC ) remotely operated vehicle , <unk> , collected sediment core from the Challenger Deep . 432 living specimens of soft @-@ walled foraminifera were identified in the sediment samples . Foraminifera are single @-@ celled protists that construct shells . There are an estimated 4 @,@ 000 species of living foraminifera . Out of the 432 organisms collected , the overwhelming majority of the sample consisted of simple , soft @-@ shelled foraminifera , with others representing species of the complex , multi @-@ chambered genera <unk> and <unk> . Overall , 85 % of the specimens consisted of soft @-@ shelled <unk> . This is unusual compared to samples of sediment @-@ dwelling organisms from other deep @-@ sea environments , where the percentage of organic @-@ walled foraminifera ranges from 5 % to 20 % of the total . Small organisms with hard <unk> shells have trouble growing at extreme depths because the water at that depth is severely lacking in calcium carbonate . 
 While similar lifeforms have been known to exist in shallower oceanic trenches ( > 7 @,@ 000 m ) and on the abyssal plain , the lifeforms discovered in the Challenger Deep may represent independent taxa from those shallower ecosystems . This preponderance of soft @-@ shelled organisms at the Challenger Deep may be a result of selection pressure . Millions of years ago , the Challenger Deep was shallower than it is now . Over the past six to nine million years , as the Challenger Deep grew to its present depth , many of the species present in the sediment of that ancient biosphere were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment . Those species that were able to adapt may have been the ancestors of the organisms currently endemic to the Challenger Deep . 
 Polychaetes occur throughout the Earth 's oceans at all depths , from forms that live as plankton near the surface , to the deepest oceanic trenches . The robot ocean probe Nereus observed a 2 – 3 cm specimen ( still unclassified ) of polychaete at the bottom of the Challenger Deep on 31 May 2009 . There are more than 10 @,@ 000 described species of polychaetes ; they can be found in nearly every marine environment . Some species live in the coldest ocean temperatures of the hadal zone , while others can be found in the extremely hot waters adjacent to hydrothermal vents . 
 Within the abyssal and hadal zones , the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents and cold seeps have by far the greatest biomass and biodiversity per unit area . Fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids , these areas are often home to large and diverse communities of thermophilic , halophilic and other <unk> prokaryotic microorganisms ( such as those of the sulfide @-@ oxidizing <unk> genus ) , often arranged in large bacterial mats near cold seeps . In these locations , chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria typically form the base of the food chain . Although the process of chemosynthesis is entirely microbial , these chemosynthetic microorganisms often support vast ecosystems consisting of complex multicellular organisms through symbiosis . These communities are characterized by species such as <unk> clams , <unk> mussels , limpets , isopods , giant tube worms , soft corals , <unk> , <unk> crabs , and <unk> shrimp . The deepest seep community discovered thus far is located in the Japan Trench , at a depth of 7700 meters . 
 Probably the most important ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation . Abyssal seafloor communities are considered to be food limited because benthic production depends on the input of detrital organic material produced in the euphotic zone , thousands of meters above . Most of the organic flux arrives as an attenuated rain of small particles ( typically , only 0 @.@ 5 – 2 % of net primary production in the euphotic zone ) , which decreases inversely with water depth . The small particle flux can be augmented by the fall of larger carcasses and downslope transport of organic material near continental margins . 
 = = Exploitation of resources = = 
 In addition to their high biodiversity , abyssal plains are of great current and future commercial and strategic interest . For example , they may be used for the legal and illegal disposal of large structures such as ships and oil rigs , radioactive waste and other hazardous waste , such as munitions . They may also be attractive sites for deep @-@ sea fishing , and extraction of oil and gas and other minerals . Future deep @-@ sea waste disposal activities that could be significant by 2025 include emplacement of sewage and sludge , carbon @-@ dioxide sequestration , and disposal of dredge spoils . 
 As fish stocks dwindle in the upper ocean , deep @-@ sea fisheries are increasingly being targeted for exploitation . Because deep sea fish are long @-@ lived and slow growing , these deep @-@ sea fisheries are not thought to be sustainable in the long term given current management practices . Changes in primary production in the photic zone are expected to alter the standing stocks in the food @-@ limited aphotic zone . 
 Hydrocarbon exploration in deep water occasionally results in significant environmental degradation resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings , but also from oil spills . While the oil gusher involved in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico originates from a wellhead only 1500 meters below the ocean surface , it nevertheless illustrates the kind of environmental disaster that can result from mishaps related to offshore drilling for oil and gas . 
 Sediments of certain abyssal plains contain abundant mineral resources , notably polymetallic nodules . These potato @-@ sized concretions of manganese , iron , nickel , cobalt , and copper , distributed on the seafloor at depths of greater than 4000 meters , are of significant commercial interest . The area of maximum commercial interest for polymetallic nodule mining ( called the Pacific nodule province ) lies in international waters of the Pacific Ocean , stretching from 118 ° – 157 ° , and from 9 ° – 16 ° N , an area of more than 3 million km ² . The abyssal Clarion @-@ Clipperton Fracture Zone ( <unk> ) is an area within the Pacific nodule province that is currently under exploration for its mineral potential . 
 Eight commercial contractors are currently licensed by the International Seabed Authority ( an intergovernmental organization established to organize and control all mineral @-@ related activities in the international seabed area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction ) to explore nodule resources and to test mining techniques in eight claim areas , each covering 150 @,@ 000 km ² . When mining ultimately begins , each mining operation is projected to directly disrupt 300 – 800 km ² of seafloor per year and disturb the benthic fauna over an area 5 – 10 times that size due to <unk> of suspended sediments . Thus , over the 15 @-@ year projected duration of a single mining operation , nodule mining might severely damage abyssal seafloor communities over areas of 20 @,@ 000 to 45 @,@ 000 km ² ( a zone at least the size of Massachusetts ) . 
 Limited knowledge of the taxonomy , biogeography and natural history of deep sea communities prevents accurate assessment of the risk of species extinctions from large @-@ scale mining . Data acquired from the abyssal North Pacific and North Atlantic suggest that deep @-@ sea ecosystems may be adversely affected by mining operations on decadal time scales . In 1978 , a dredge aboard the Hughes Glomar Explorer , operated by the American mining consortium Ocean Minerals Company ( <unk> ) , made a mining track at a depth of 5000 meters in the nodule fields of the <unk> . In 2004 , the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea ( IFREMER ) conducted the <unk> expedition to this mining track ( which is still visible on the seabed ) to study the long @-@ term effects of this physical disturbance on the sediment and its benthic fauna . Samples taken of the superficial sediment revealed that its physical and chemical properties had not shown any recovery since the disturbance made 26 years earlier . On the other hand , the biological activity measured in the track by instruments aboard the manned submersible <unk> Nautile did not differ from a nearby unperturbed site . This data suggests that the benthic fauna and nutrient fluxes at the water – sediment interface has fully recovered .

 The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In this episode , Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) is shocked when Stanley Hudson ( Leslie David Baker ) yells at him , and is unsure how to handle the situation .

Meanwhile , Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) receives a warning about his job performance , Pam Beesley ( Jenna Fischer ) is forced to wear her glasses , and Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) buys Andy Bernard 's ( Ed Helms ) car . 
 Originally , episode writers Justin Spitzer and Brent Forrester were supposed to write two separate episodes . However , the effects of the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike forced the two to share an episode . " Did I Stutter ? " contained several pop culture references . It received largely positive reviews from critics , who praised the interaction between Carell and Baker . The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 3 @.@ 9 in the 18 – 49 demographic , being viewed by 7 @.@ 76 million viewers .

 Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) calls an emergency meeting asking everyone to come up with an idea to " re @-@ invigorate " the office . Michael asks Stanley Hudson ( Leslie David Baker ) for ideas , but Stanley is preoccupied with a crossword puzzle and says he 's busy . Michael keeps asking him , and Stanley finally snaps at Michael , and says the titular " Did I stutter ? " in a very loud , threatening tone . Michael , who is visibly shaken , ends the meeting . Toby Flenderson ( Paul Lieberstein ) encourages Michael to take disciplinary action against Stanley , and Michael , initially resistant , decides to pretend to fire him to teach him a lesson . Michael first tells everyone in the office that he is not really firing him , and does so in front of all of them . Stanley responds by threatening to sue him and tell corporate of Michael 's antics . When Michael tells Stanley that the firing was actually an attempt at teaching him a lesson , Stanley is angered and goes on a rant , yelling and insulting Michael . Michael suddenly barks at him to stop it , and tells everyone to leave the office , making everyone think he 's about to berate Stanley . The camera crew sneak back in to film the exchange , where Michael tearfully ( much to Stanley 's annoyance ) but calmly asks Stanley why he picks on him . Stanley states that he simply does not respect him , and when Michael suggests that Stanley doesn 't know him very well he replies " Michael , I 've known you for a very long time . And the more I 've gotten to know you , the less I 've come to respect you . " Michael then takes an uncharacteristically professional tone with Stanley , and says that , while he accepts that Stanley doesn 't respect him , he can 't take such a disrespectful tone with him , because he is his boss . Stanley responds by saying , " Fair enough , " and the two shake hands . 
 Pam Beesly ( Jenna Fischer ) , after spending the night at " a friend 's " ( Jim 's ) house , forgot her contact lens solution , so she must wear her glasses all day . She finds it difficult to handle Michael 's criticism and Kevin 's sexual advances , and spends the rest of the day without her glasses , reducing her productivity . Ryan Howard ( B. J. Novak ) comes to Dunder Mifflin 's Scranton branch , and after a talk with Toby , Ryan tells Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) that he is giving him an official warning about his job performance . Ryan denies that his action is motivated by Jim 's previous complaints to David Wallace , saying he thrives on constructive criticism ( while Toby 's comments to the documentary crew indicate he 's not upset about the warning , owing to his envy of Jim 's relationship with Pam ) . Meanwhile , Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) is selling his 2001 Nissan <unk> for $ 8 @,@ 700 , and Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) pressures him into selling it for $ 1 @,@ 500 less than the asking price , because according to Dwight , " ( the ) car is crap " . Dwight assures Andy that he will only use it as a wagon and dragged by a mule on Dwight 's beet farm . Andy then sells it to Dwight , who , in a passive @-@ aggressive method of getting back at him for dating Angela Martin ( Angela Kinsey ) , washes it and posts a sign asking for $ 9 @,@ 995 for the vehicle , which upsets Andy when he finds Dwight 's advertisement posted on the cabinet in the office kitchen . Dwight declares that it is already on <unk> which he claims is the subject of a three @-@ way bidding war .

 The episode was the fourth episode of the series directed by Randall Einhorn . Einhorn had previously directed the third season episodes " Initiation " , " Ben Franklin " and " Product Recall " , as well as the ten summer webisodes " The Accountants " . It was Einhorn 's idea to show the cameramen sneaking back into the office after Michael told everyone to leave . This aspect of the episode was praised by fans as wells as the cast and crew . Brent Forrester , the co @-@ writer of the episode , noted that Einhorn 's " energy doubled when shooting that " scene . 
 " Did I Stutter ? " was written by Justin Spitzer and Brent Forrester . Although the two writers initially planned to write separate episodes , the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike forced the two to share an episode . Forrester and Spitzer initially disagreed about what the episode 's title should be . Forrester wanted to name it " Did I Stutter ? " — a phrase popularized by Judd Nelson 's character Bender in the 1985 film The Breakfast Club — while Spitzer wanted a name like " The <unk> " or " Insubordination " . Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg wrote the scenes featuring Andy and Angela playing Mad Libs . Justin Spitzer called the sequence " amazing " . 
 In the opening scene in which Michael puts his face in cement , the wet cement that was used was actually putty . The crew was planning to do only one take of Steve Carell putting his face in the putty , so he was instructed to hold his breath as long as he possibly could . But the crew forgot to tell the other actors about that , so during the filming of the scene , the actors thought he was actually stuck and there was a rush to pull him out . Kim M. Ferry , owner of the Nissan <unk> featured in the episode , is the show 's Department Head Hairstylist . After it was used on the show , she decided to sell it on eBay . The listing was first put up on eBay on May 1 , 2008 , the night the episode aired . 
 The Season Four DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode . Notable cut scenes include Michael trying to convince Jim , Pam , and Kelly , while they are in the break room having lunch that Stanley talks badly about everyone behind their backs , Michael making Pam stand up during the meeting and confessing that she wears glasses , Jim talking to Toby about the warning ( in contrast to how Toby seems happy that Jim is getting in trouble during the broadcast episode , here the HR head makes it clear that Jim 's sales performance is good and that Ryan is the sole person who isn 't happy with his work ) , and Ryan saying that " going after Jim " is " a risky move " , since CFO David Wallace likes Jim .

 Andy and Angela play Mad Libs , a phrasal template word game where one player prompts another for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story , usually with funny results . Ryan chides Jim for being a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles , a professional American football team . While Daryl is telling Michael how gang members deal with problems , he mentions that he was a member of the Newsies ( the name of a 1992 musical drama ) and The Warriors ( the gang in the 1979 cult action film of the same name ) . Near the end of the episode , Michael does a succession of comedian impressions . These include badly performed spoofs of Rodney Dangerfield , Henny Youngman , Jeff Foxworthy , Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat , and Jerry Seinfeld .

 = We Can Do It ! = 
 " We Can Do It ! " is an American wartime propaganda poster produced by J. Howard Miller in 1943 for Westinghouse Electric as an inspirational image to boost worker morale . 
 The poster was seen very little during World War II . It was rediscovered in the early 1980s and widely reproduced in many forms , often called " We Can Do It ! " but also called " Rosie the Riveter " after the iconic figure of a strong female war production worker . The " We Can Do It ! " image was used to promote feminism and other political issues beginning in the 1980s . The image made the cover of the Smithsonian magazine in 1994 and was fashioned into a US first @-@ class mail stamp in 1999 . It was incorporated in 2008 into campaign materials for several American politicians , and was reworked by an artist in 2010 to celebrate the first woman becoming prime minister of Australia . The poster is one of the ten most @-@ requested images at the National Archives and Records Administration . 
 After its rediscovery , observers often assumed that the image was always used as a call to inspire women workers to join the war effort . However , during the war the image was strictly internal to Westinghouse , displayed only during February 1943 , and was not for recruitment but to exhort already @-@ hired women to work harder . Feminists and others have seized upon the uplifting attitude and apparent message to remake the image into many different forms , including self empowerment , campaign promotion , advertising , and parodies . 
 After she saw the Smithsonian cover image in 1994 , Geraldine Hoff Doyle said that she was the subject of the poster . Doyle thought that she had also been captured in a wartime photograph of a woman factory worker , and she innocently assumed that this photo inspired Miller 's poster . <unk> her as " Rosie the Riveter " , Doyle was honored by many organizations including the Michigan Women 's Historical Center and Hall of Fame . However , in 2015 , the woman in the wartime photograph was identified as 20 @-@ year @-@ old Naomi Parker , working in early 1942 before Doyle had graduated high school . Doyle 's notion that the photograph inspired the poster cannot be proved or disproved , so first Doyle and then Parker cannot be confirmed as the model for " We Can Do It ! "

 After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , the US government called upon manufacturers to produce greater amounts of war goods . The workplace atmosphere at large factories was often tense because of resentment built up between management and labor unions throughout the 1930s . Directors of companies such as General Motors ( GM ) sought to minimize past friction and encourage teamwork . In response to a rumored public relations campaign by the United Auto Workers union , GM quickly produced a propaganda poster in 1942 showing both labor and management rolling up their sleeves , aligned toward maintaining a steady rate of war production . The poster read , " Together We Can Do It ! " and " Keep ' Em Firing ! " In creating such posters , corporations wished to increase production by tapping popular pro @-@ war sentiment , with the ultimate goal of preventing the government from exerting greater control over production .
