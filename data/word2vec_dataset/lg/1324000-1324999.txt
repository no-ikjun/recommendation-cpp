 The Pillau class ships were 134 @.@ 3 meters ( 441 ft ) long at the waterline and 135 @.@ 3 m ( 444 ft ) long overall They had a beam of 13 @.@ 6 m ( 45 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 98 m ( 19 @.@ 6 ft ) forward and 5 @.@ 31 m ( 17 @.@ 4 ft ) aft . They displaced 4 @,@ 390 metric tons ( 4 @,@ 320 long tons ; 4 @,@ 840 short tons ) at designed displacement and 5 @,@ 252 t ( 5 @,@ 169 long tons ; 5 @,@ 789 short tons ) at full combat load . The ships ' hulls were constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames . The hulls were divided into sixteen watertight compartments and had a double bottom that extended for 51 percent of the length of the hull . 
 The ships had a crew of twenty @-@ one officers and 421 enlisted men . They carried a number of smaller boats , including one picket boat , one barge , two yawls , and two dinghies . They were good sea boats , but were fairly stiff and suffered from severe roll . The cruisers were maneuverable , but were slow going into a turn . Steering was controlled by a single large rudder . They lost speed only slightly in a head sea , but lost up to sixty percent in hard turns . 
 Their propulsion system consisted of two sets of Marine steam turbines driving two 3 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 11 ft ) propellers . They were designed to give 30 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 22 @,@ 400 kW ) . These were powered by six coal @-@ fired Yarrow water @-@ tube boilers , and four oil @-@ fired Yarrow boilers , trunked into three funnels on the centerline . These gave the ships a top speed of 27 @.@ 5 knots ( 50 @.@ 9 km / h ; 31 @.@ 6 mph ) . The two ships carried 620 t ( 610 long tons ) of coal , and an additional 580 t ( 570 long tons ) of oil that gave them a range of approximately 4 @,@ 300 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 000 km ; 4 @,@ 900 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . The two ships each had three turbo @-@ generators that provided a combined electrical output of 360 kilowatts ( 480 hp ) at 220 Volts . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 As designed , the ships would have mounted eight 13 @-@ centimeter ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) L / 55 quick @-@ firing guns and four 6 @.@ 3 cm ( 2 @.@ 5 in ) L / 38 guns of Russian design . After they were seized by the German Navy , the planned armament was revised to be standardized with new German cruisers . The standard 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 gun used on previous German cruisers was considered , but abandoned in favor of a larger weapon . As completed , the ships were armed with eight 15 cm SK L / 45 guns in single pedestal mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , four were located amidships , two on either side , and two were side by side aft . They were the first German light cruisers to mount the 15 cm gun . These guns had a range of 17 @,@ 600 m ( 57 @,@ 700 ft ) and were supplied with a total of 1 @,@ 024 rounds of ammunition . Pillau and Elbing also carried four 5 @.@ 2 cm SK L / 55 anti @-@ aircraft guns , though these were replaced with a pair of two 8 @.@ 8 cm SK L / 45 anti @-@ aircraft guns . They were also equipped with a pair of 50 cm ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes mounted on the deck . The ships could also carry 120 mines . 
 Since they had been ordered and designed for the Russian Navy , the ships did not possess a waterline armored belt like contemporary German designs . The conning tower had 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) thick sides and a 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick roof . The deck was covered with 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick armor plate forward , which was reduced to 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) aft . Sloping armor 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick provided a measure of protection on the upper portion of the ships ' sides . The main battery guns were equipped with 50 mm thick gun shields .

 = = = Pillau = = = 
 Pillau spent the majority of her career in the II Scouting Group , and saw service in both the Baltic and North Seas . In August 1915 , she participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga against the Russian Navy , and on 31 May – 1 June 1916 , she saw significant action at the Battle of Jutland . She was hit by a large @-@ caliber shell once in the engagement , but suffered only moderate damage . She assisted the badly damaged battlecruiser SMS Seydlitz reach port on 2 June after the conclusion of the battle . She also took part in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight , though was not damaged in the engagement . Pillau was assigned to the planned , final operation of the High Seas Fleet in the closing weeks of the war , but a large scale mutiny in the fleet forced it to be canceled . 
 After the end of the war , Pillau was ceded to Italy as a war prize in 1920 . Renamed Bari , she was commissioned in the Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) in January 1924 . She was modified and rebuilt several times over the next two decades . In the early years of World War II , she provided gunfire support to Italian troops in several engagements in the Mediterranean . In 1943 , she was slated to become an anti @-@ aircraft defense ship , but while awaiting conversion , she was sunk by USAAF bombers in Livorno in June 1943 . The wreck was partially scrapped by the Germans in 1944 , and ultimately raised for scrapping in January 1948 .

 Elbing participated in only two major operations during her career . The first , the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft , occurred in April 1916 ; there , she briefly engaged the British Harwich Force . A month later , she took part in the Battle of Jutland , where she scored the first hit of the engagement . She was heavily engaged in the confused fighting on the night of 31 May – 1 June , and shortly after midnight she was accidentally rammed by the battleship Posen , which tore a hole in the ship 's hull . Flooding disabled the ship 's engines and electrical generators , rendering her immobilized and without power . At around 02 : 00 , a German torpedo boat took off most of her crew , and an hour later the remaining men scuttled the ship ; they escaped in the ship 's cutter and were later picked up by a Dutch steamer .

 = Granny ( orca ) = 
 Granny , also known as J2 , is an orca , or killer whale , estimated by some whale researchers to be 105 years old , which , if correct , would make her the oldest known living orca . Granny had been captured with the rest of her pod in 1967 but was too old at that time for a marine mammal park , so was released . In 1967 , Granny was estimated to have been born in 1911 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Granny is recognizable from the gray " saddle patch " just behind her dorsal fin , and a half @-@ moon notch in her fin . Simon Pidcock of Ocean <unk> said he has seen Granny thousands of times , and that the markings on orca fins are like fingerprints . 
 Now that orca studies have been going on for several decades , the exact age of many whales is known . The age of older orcas , such as Granny , is estimated by their offspring ; they give birth around age 15 , and stop having offspring around 40 ; by adding the generations together , ages can be estimated . There are also photographs of Granny from the 1930s and the size and growth of Granny and the other orcas is also used in the age estimates . In Granny 's case , she was photographed in 1971 with a male orca , J1 Ruffles , who was thought to be Granny 's son . Ruffles was estimated as at least 20 years old , and as scientists believed him to be Granny 's last offspring , her own age was estimated at about 60 . However , it was later determined through DNA that Ruffles was not Granny 's son . 
 = = J pod = = 
 Granny , along with several of her descendants , travels in the J pod , a group of about 25 orcas . J pod , along with Pods K and L , are the " J clan " , which is part of the southern resident killer whale population . They frequent the inland waters of British Columbia and Washington State in the summer months , but roam from southeast Alaska to central California . They have completed a journey as far as 800 miles in a week . 
 A well @-@ known male orca thought to be Granny 's son is J1 Ruffles . He was last seen in 2010 . According to researchers , Granny also has multiple grandchildren and great @-@ grandchildren travelling in the pod with her . 
 The southern resident killer whales are the most studied population of killer whales in the world . Many whales in this population were captured in the 1960s and 1970s for use in sea parks , and others were killed by hunters attempting to capture them . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 As the oldest known orca , Granny is used in arguments against keeping whales in captivity , referencing the allegedly reduced lifespan of whales in captivity . The oldest orca in captivity is the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Lolita who is at the Miami Seaquarium . The average lifespan for a captured orca is 20 to 30 years . Of Granny 's age , Captain Pidcock of Ocean <unk> Whale Watching said " [ ... ] it ’ s mind @-@ blowing to think that this whale is over 100 years old . She was born before the Titanic went down . Can you imagine the things she ’ s seen in her lifetime ? " 
 Granny was also used as a focal point of environmental efforts that resulted in the Endangered Species Act protections for orca . Environmentalists estimate that Granny may have a PCB load of up to 100 parts per million , and that her descendants ' reproductive systems may have been damaged by exposure to pollution . Additionally , Granny and her family are at risk from declining West Coast salmon populations . 
 Granny was featured in a children 's book on orcas titled Granny 's Clan : A Tale of Wild Orcas by Sally Hodson . 
 = = Orca lifespan = = 
 Estimates of lifespans for wild orcas vary . Seaworld says wild lifespans are 30 – 50 years for females , and 19 – 30 years for males . These estimates are similar to the estimates from a 2005 study . Marine conservation groups argue that these estimates are low due to the effects of hunting , pollution , and capture on the wild populations , and that natural wild orca lifespans are equivalent to that of humans , with male orcas living up to 75 years and female orcas living up to 80 years ) . 
 = Night of Desirable Objects ( Fringe ) = 
 " Night of Desirable Objects " is the second episode of the second season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe . The episode followed Olivia and Peter 's investigation into mysterious disappearances taking place in a small Pennsylvania town . 
 The episode was written by executive producers / showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J. H. Wyman , and directed by Brad Anderson . It was the last episode to feature guest actress Meghan Markle as Agent Amy Jessup , but was the first with recurring guest actors Kevin Corrigan and Stefan Arngrim . 
 " Night of Desirable Objects " premiered on September 24 , 2009 to an estimated 7 @.@ 73 million viewers in the United States . It received generally positive reviews , as multiple critics praised the storyline while at the same time acknowledging it did little to advance the show 's mythology . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Lansdale , Pennsylvania , a highway construction worker hears an odd noise in a cornfield , and is pulled down into an underground tunnel by a mysterious , unidentified creature . Using a lighter for sight , he sees the remains of other creatures , and is then eaten by the creature off screen . Meanwhile , Walter ( John Noble ) investigates Olivia 's ( Anna Torv ) car crash from the previous episode . He believes she traveled to a parallel universe that is similar to theirs , but she still cannot remember with whom she met with , or why . 
 Having recovered enough from the events of the previous episode , Olivia is released from the hospital , and is watched by the shapeshifter who has killed Charlie Francis ( Kirk Acevedo ) and adopted his appearance . Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) learns of mysterious disappearances taking place in Lansdale , and the Fringe team arrives to investigate . Walter finds a blue , paralytic substance at the scene , which he suspects is from mutated DNA . The investigation leads to a local resident , Andre Hughes ( John Savage ) , who tells them he lost his wife and baby in childbirth . Olivia begins to develop super @-@ hearing as a result of crossing to the parallel universe , and hears someone else in Hughes ' house despite his saying he 's the only one there . She ventures upstairs to investigate ; after failing to find anything , she accidentally fires her weapon , narrowly missing Peter . They bring Hughes in for questioning , and he refuses to give them a blood sample for their investigation . 
 Nina Sharp ( Blair Brown ) talks with Olivia , and recommends she see a friend , Sam Weiss ( Kevin Corrigan ) " who helped put [ her ] back together " after she was diagnosed with cancer . Agent Amy Jessup ( Meghan Markle ) and she believes Hughes may have killed his wife and son . When they exhume their bodies , they find the baby 's casket is empty . Hughes commits suicide however before they can question him further . 
 Walter discovers that Hughes ' wife had a form of lupus , and was incapable of having children . Hughes genetically altered the baby to enable his survival , and after birth , it developed into a " <unk> " and began feeding on people . Olivia and Peter travel back to Hughes ' house , and are attacked by the creature when investigating the basement and its nearby tunnels . The creature attempts to escape by digging out but is killed by a police car parked above ground upon collapsing into the tunnel , thereby crushing the creature . 
 At Nina 's recommendation , Olivia meets with Sam Weiss , who works at a bowling alley . He tells her to expect headaches as one consequence of crossing universes . The final scene shows the shapeshifted Charlie communicating with someone from the parallel universe , who tells him to help make Olivia remember her experience crossing over . 
 = = Production = = 
 Executive producers and showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman wrote the episode , while filmmaker Brad Anderson served as the director , his first such credit for the season . 
 The show 's sound production team had two major special effects to create for the episode : the mole creature , and Olivia 's <unk> . They decided to voice the creature using Automated Dialogue Replacement ( ADR ) " because his range of actions and emotions was simply too broad for a library monster vocal set to cover " . Sound editor Bruce Tanis cut " creepy moans and breaths " when the creature was heard but not seen , and added " a layer of vicious attack growls and wounded screams " for when it died . Tanis commented that the actor voicing the creature placed pieces of orange in his mouth in order to have " a <unk> , sputtering voice " . For Olivia 's scenes with <unk> , Tanis made ordinary , far off items like phones , typewriters , and cars " sound a little beefier than normal and kept them a bit more up in the mix than they usually would be , " as these things were not in the same room as her . The sound editors wanted to emphasize that the various sounds she hears could be coming from anywhere , such as next door , or a block away , or could perhaps be all inside her head . Torv later noted in a BuddyTV interview that while shooting , she was unsure whether her newfound abilities were permanent or temporary , to which the writers replied that " apparently it 's just something that comes and goes " . After expressing her confusion , they responded " Oh that 's good , Olivia 's confused too " . 
 " Night of Desirable Objects " was the first episode to feature guest actor Kevin Corrigan as the mysterious Sam Weiss . To help Corrigan , Torv compared Sam Weiss to the Oracle in The Matrix , which the actor had not yet seen . Corrigan noted , " It opened my mind up ... So now Sam 's just this regular guy in a bowling alley but he 's so much more than that . " Weiss ' appearance generated some rumors that he was a figment of Olivia 's imagination , causing actress Anna Torv to state in a later interview that she has always believed Weiss to be " 100 percent real " and her character 's " guide " . The episode marked the last appearance by guest actress Meghan Markle , who plays Agent Amy Jessup . Frequent Fringe collaborator Akiva Goldsman later hinted in January 2010 that audiences have " not seen the last of Agent Jessup " . Other guest stars included John Savage and Charles Martin Smith , as well as Stefan Arngrim , who made his second appearance on the series .

 The episode received mostly positive reviews . Writing for The A.V.

Ramsey Isler from IGN rated the episode 8 @.@ 1 / 10 , writing that despite its " relative insignificance " at explaining more show mythology , it " was still very well done , creepy as hell , and pretty entertaining " . He also praised the main actors ' performances , but wished Fringe would answer more questions and produce less " monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week " episodes . 
 Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times wrote he recognizes the show is trying to define itself , and compared Peter 's newfound leadership to The X @-@ Files ' Fox Mulder , praised Acevedo 's performance as " evil Charlie , " but found some of Walter 's mannerisms to be " cheesy " . SFScope writer Sarah Stegall lauded the premise of multiple universes , and called the episode 's horror elements the reason she is now " a devoted fan of this show " . Stegall also praised Kirk Acevedo 's performance as well as the parallels between Andrea Hughes and Walter ; she concluded " This may have been the best episode of this entire series , second perhaps to last season 's finale , and certainly better than anything the anemic Grey 's Anatomy or the aging CSI can offer " . 
 On the other hand , MTV 's Josh Wigler thought the episode 's mystery was " barely compelling " when compared to the aftereffects of Olivia 's journey to the parallel universe , and wished that more time had been focused on this . Though he understood that Fringe " rides a fine line between an ongoing drama and a series of stand @-@ alone stories , " Wigler believed the show would have to choose one soon , and wanted the focus to be on the former and its parallel universe storyline . UGO Networks writer Alex Zalben later compared " Night of Desirable Objects " to the similarly @-@ plotted episodes " Johari Window " of Fringe and " Home " of The X @-@ Files . Zalben found " Home " to be superior , explaining that " the two Fringe eps are basically the one X @-@ Files ep split in two , " and " clearly , ' Home ' was a good enough episode to inspire [ them ] .

 = Martinique macaw = 
 The Martinique macaw or orange @-@ bellied macaw ( Ara martinicus ) is a hypothetical extinct species of macaw which may have been endemic to the Lesser Antillean island of Martinique , in the eastern Caribbean Sea . It was scientifically named by Walter Rothschild in 1905 , based on a 1630s description of " blue and orange @-@ yellow " macaws by Père Jacques Bouton . No other evidence of its existence is known , but it may have been identified in contemporary artwork . Some writers have suggested that the birds observed were actually blue @-@ and @-@ yellow macaws ( Ara ararauna ) . The " red @-@ tailed blue @-@ and @-@ yellow macaw " ( Ara erythrura ) , another species described by Rothschild in 1907 based on a 1658 account , is thought to be identical to the Martinique macaw , if either has ever existed . 
 The Martinique macaw is one of thirteen extinct macaw species that have been proposed to have lived in the Caribbean islands . Many of these species are now considered dubious because only three are known from physical remains , and there are no extant endemic macaws on the islands today . Macaws were frequently transported between the Caribbean islands and the South American mainland in both prehistoric and historic times , so it is impossible to know whether contemporaneous reports refer to imported or native species . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Martinique macaw was scientifically described by the British banker and zoologist Walter Rothschild in 1905 , as a new species of the genus Anodorhynchus , A. martinicus . The taxon was solely based on a 1630s account by Père Jacques Bouton of blue and orange @-@ yellow macaws from the Lesser Antillean island of Martinique . Rothschild reclassified the species as Ara martinicus in his 1907 book , Extinct Birds , which also contained a restoration of the bird by the Dutch artist John Gerrard Keulemans . The reassignment lead to confusion as recently as 2001 , when Williams and Steadman assumed the two names were meant to refer to separate birds . The Martinique amazon ( Amazona <unk> ) of the same island , was also based solely on a contemporary description . 
 What Bouton described is likely to remain a mystery , but various theories have been proposed . In 1906 , Tommaso Salvadori noted that the Martinique macaw seemed similar to the blue @-@ and @-@ yellow macaw ( Ara ararauna ) of mainland South America , and may had been the same bird . The American ornithologist James Greenway suggested Bouton 's description could have been based on a captive bird . Edwards ' Dodo , a 1626 painting by the Dutch artist Roelant Savery , shows several birds including a blue and yellow macaw , which is different from the mainland bird in having yellow undertail covert feathers instead of blue , but the origin of this macaw is unknown . Another macaw in the painting may be the also extinct Lesser Antillean macaw ( Ara guadeloupensis ) . Another Savery painting from about the same time shows a similar blue and yellow macaw , as does a mid @-@ 1700s illustration by the English naturalist Eleazar Albin . In 1936 , a Cuban scientist claimed to have found a stuffed Martinique macaw specimen , which was supposed to have been collected in 1845 . After examination it was shown to be a hoax , combining a burrowing parakeet ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) with the tail of a dove . 
 In the article that named the Martinique macaw , Rothschild also listed an " Anodorhynchus coeruleus " , supposedly from Jamaica . Salvadori also questioned this in 1906 , as he was unsure what Rothschild was referring to . In his Extinct Birds , Rothschild clarified that his first description was erroneous , as he had misread an old description . He renamed it Ara erythrura , based on a 1658 description by Charles de Rochefort , and conceded that its provenance was unknown . This supposed species subsequently received common names such as " red @-@ tailed blue @-@ and @-@ yellow macaw " and " satin macaw " in the ornithological literature . Greenway suggested Rochefort 's description was dubious , as he had never visited Jamaica , and appeared to have based his account on one by Jean @-@ Baptiste Du Tertre . If either bird ever existed , Ara erythrura is likely to have been identical to the Martinique macaw . Other similar blue and yellow macaws , such as the " great macaw " ( " Psittacus maximus <unk> " ) were also reported from Jamaica . Birdlife International does not have an entry for the Martinique macaw , but it was mentioned in that of the Lesser Antillean macaw ( which is considered Not Recognized ) as possibly identical .

 Macaws are known to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from mainland South America both in historic times by Europeans and natives , and prehistoric times by Paleoamericans . Parrots were important in the culture of native Caribbeans , were traded between islands , and were among the gifts offered to Christopher Columbus when he reached the Bahamas in 1492 . It is therefore difficult to determine whether the numerous historical records of macaws on these islands refer to distinct , endemic species , since they could have been based on escaped individuals or feral populations of foreign macaws of known species that had been transported there . As many as thirteen extinct macaws have been suggested to have lived on the islands until recently . Only three endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains ; the Cuban macaw ( Ara tricolor ) is known from nineteen museum skins and subfossils , the Saint Croix macaw ( Ara autochthones ) is only known from subfossils , and the Lesser Antillean macaw is known from subfossils and reports . No endemic Caribbean macaws remain today ; they were likely driven to extinction by humans in historic and prehistoric times . 
 Many hypothetical extinct macaws were based only on contemporaneous accounts , but these species are considered dubious today . Several of them were named in the early 20th century by Rothschild , who had a tendency to name species based on little tangible evidence . Among others , the red @-@ headed macaw ( Ara erythrocephala ) and the Jamaican red macaw ( Ara <unk> ) were named for accounts of macaws on Jamaica , and the Dominican green @-@ and @-@ yellow macaw ( Ara <unk> ) was supposedly from Dominica island . The violet macaw ( Anodorhynchus purpurascens ) , which was named for accounts of blue parrots supposedly from Guadeloupe , is now thought to have been based on references to the Guadeloupe amazon ( Amazona violacea ) . 
 Other species of macaw have also been mentioned , but many never received binomials , or are considered junior synonyms of other species . Williams and Steadman defended the validity of most named Caribbean macaw species , and wrote that each Greater and Lesser Antillean island probably had its own endemic species . Olson and Maíz doubted the validity of the hypothetical macaws , and that all Antillean islands once had endemic species , but wrote that the island of Hispaniola would be the most likely place for another macaw species to have existed because of the large land area , though no descriptions or remains of such are known . They wrote that such a species could have been driven to extinction before the arrival of Europeans . The identity and distribution of indigenous macaws in the Caribbean is only likely to be further resolved through palaeontological discoveries and examination of contemporary reports and artwork . 
 = = Contemporary descriptions = = 
 Bouton 's original description of the Martinique macaw is reproduced below , translated from French : 
 The macaws are two or three times as large as the other parrots , [ and ] have a plumage much different in colour : those that I have seen have their plumage blue and orange @-@ yellow ( saffron ) . They also learn to talk and have a good body . 
 A translation of the original French description of " Ara erythrura " by de Rochefort follows below : 
 Among them are some which have the head , the upper side of the neck , and the back of a satiny sky blue ; the underside of the neck , the belly , and undersurface of the wings , yellow , and the tail entirely red . 
 In spite of the fact that the tail of " Ara erythrura " was described as entirely red , the plate in Rothschild 's Extinct Birds showed a blue tip , which Charles Wallace Richmond complained about in his review of the book . 
 = Cyclone Connie = 
 Cyclone Connie was a strong tropical cyclone that affected both Mauritius and Réunion in late January 2000 . On January 24 , 2000 , a tropical disturbance developed well east of Madagascar . Despite moderate wind shear , it gradually strengthened while stalling offshore , and late on January 25 , was believed to have attained tropical storm status . After turning generally southeast , Connie attained cyclone intensity on January 27 . Rapid intensification ensued . Shortly after developing a well @-@ defined eye , Connie attained peak intensity at 0000 UTC on January 28 as an intense tropical cyclone . Thereafter , Connie slowly weakened due to increased wind shear as thunderstorm activity quickly diminished around the eye . After threatening Mauritius , Connie then turned southwest , passing very close to Réunion late on January 28 . After briefly leveling off in intensity that evening , Connie soon became less organized , and midday on January 29 , the eye became less defined . The next day , Connie weakened to a severe tropical storm . Despite forecasts of additional weakening , Connie maintained its intensity for most of January 31 . However , weakening resumed on February 1 and the storm transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on February 2 . Two days later , Connie merged with another low @-@ pressure area . 
 Despite passing well offshore Mauritius , both the airport and the port were closed due to lack of certainty in the storm 's path . Connie brought several days of heavy rains and gusty winds to the island . One person was killed there and power was briefly disconnected . Overall , damage on Mauritius was minor . While passing near Reunion , Cyclone Connie brought heavy rains to the island nation . Power was knocked out to around 40 @,@ 000 individuals . Roughly 100 homes were destroyed , leaving 600 people were homeless . Another 300 sought shelter . Two people were killed , but damage in Reunion was minimal . The extratropical remnants of the system later brought flooding to Mozambique , where 20 @,@ 000 people were listed as homeless . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On January 22 , an area of disturbed weather developed around 10 ° S to 15 ° S , a prime location for tropical cyclone formation within the basin . Although the system gradually became better organized , moderate easterly wind shear prevented significant development . By January 24 this area was located approximately 600 km ( 375 mi ) east of the northern tip of Madagascar . Following a significant increase in organization due to decreased wind shear , the Météo @-@ France office in Reunion ( MFR ) upgraded the system into Tropical Disturbance 4 . At 1100 UTC on January 25 , MFR upgraded the disturbance into a tropical depression while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) for the system . At 1800 UTC that day , the MFR upgraded the system into Moderate Tropical Storm Connie while the JTWC also upgraded Connie into a tropical storm . 
 Situated in an environment of favorable wind shear , Connie steadily became better organized . It quickly developed rainbands and good outflow . At first , Connie was nearly stationary but on January 26 , moved northeastward under the influence of a subtropical ridge . Tropical Cyclone Connie slowly strengthened , although this process was slowed due to upwelling of cold ocean waters . That morning , the JTWC upgraded Connie to a 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) hurricane . At <unk> UTC , satellite imagery dedicated a 50 km ( 30 mi ) wide eye . Despite the eye feature , MFR assessed the intensity at 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) . Early the next day , however , MFR classified Connie as a severe tropical storm following satellite data , which suggested that Connie had developed an 80 % closed eyewall . Moving east @-@ southeast , Connie was upgraded to cyclone intensity at noon on January 27 . Meanwhile , the JTWC revised the storms intensity to 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) , equivalent to a low @-@ end Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale ( SSHWS ) roughly 780 km ( 485 mi ) north @-@ northwest of Mauritius . 
 With an upper @-@ level high located near the cyclone , the tropical cyclone steadily became better organized and thus Connie began to strengthen rapidly , as previously indicated by many tropical cyclone forecast models . The system then began to slowly turn southeast in the general direction of Mauritius and Réunion . By 1800 UTC on January 27 , Tropical Cyclone Connie developed a very well defined eye ; based on this , MFR upgraded Connie to a very intense tropical cyclone . Around this time , the JTWC raised the intensity of Connie to 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) , equal to a borderline Category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS , based on Dvorak intensity estimates of <unk> and <unk> After passing around 500 km ( 310 mi ) north @-@ northwest of Mauritius , Connie then decelerated east @-@ southeast . At 0000 UTC on January 28 , MFR estimated that Connie attained its peak intensity of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . Despite this cloud tops associated with Connie began to warm , even though the eye remained well @-@ defined . Thus , the JTWC lowered the intensity of Connie to 190 km / h ( 120 mph ) , based on a blend of satellite intensity estimates . 
 Early on January 28 , Connie made its closest approach to St. Brandon and initially appeared to be approaching Mauritius . However , many computer models correctly predicted Connie to turn southwest and threaten Reunion . Throughout the day , Connie maintained its intensity , but by the evening on January 28 , thunderstorm activity diminished and the cloud structure became less organized , though the storm maintained a small eye . Increased southerly wind shear from a tropical upper tropospheric trough ( TUTT ) took toll on the system . During the morning hours of January 29 both agencies reduced the intensity to 145 km / h ( 90 mph ) as the storm began to encounter dry air . By the afternoon , MFR downgraded Connie to tropical cyclone status ; the eye had become cloud @-@ filled , although it was still visible on radar . That night , the storm passed 130 km ( 80 mi ) northwest of Reunion . Early on January 30 , MFR downgraded Connie to a severe tropical storm . Later that day , the JTWC estimated that Connie lost hurricane @-@ force winds roughly 500 km ( 310 mi ) east of the southern tip of Madagascar ; all of the storm 's deep convection by this time was displaced to the south . 
 After moving away from Reunion , Connie accelerated towards the south around a subtropical ridge situated near Amsterdam Island . On January 31 , Connie turned southeast , steered about a trough to the southeast . Contrary to forecasts which predicted continued weakening , MFR kept the intensity at 105 km / h ( 65 mph ) for most of January 31 . Based on satellite derived intensity estimates , the JTWC briefly re @-@ upgraded Connie to a Category 1 hurricane equivalent on the SSHWS at 1800 UTC . However , the re @-@ strengthening trend was short lived due to increased northwesterly wind shear . Satellite imagery early on February 1 revealed an exposed circulation and a rapid decreased of thunderstorm activity in bothy coverage and intensity . Based on this and the fact that the storm appeared to be losing tropical characteristics , MFR issued its final advisory on Connie . However , the JTWC continued to track Connie until February 2 , when it merged with an extratropical low . At the time of dissipation , the JTWC assessed the intensity of Connie at 50 km / h ( 30 mph ) . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Despite large uncertainty in the storm 's path , the international airport on the eastern side of Mauritius and all ships within the Port Louis harbor had departed . A cyclone warning was declared and 165 shelters were opened . As a precaution , power was turned off . However , on the afternoon of January 29 all sea and airports were re @-@ opened and power was turned back on as the storm moved away . 
 While making its closet approach to Mauritius on January 28 , Connie brought heavy rains and strong winds to the archipelago . Winds greater than 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) were recorded through much of the island , including a peak of 134 km / h ( 83 mph ) in <unk> . During a six @-@ day period from January 26 to January 31 , many locations along the eastern portion of the island received 600 mm ( 25 in ) , equivalent to approximately a month 's worth of rainfall , including a maximum rainfall of 647 mm ( 25 @.@ 5 in ) . These rains helped relieve extreme drought conditions . Offshore , waves up to 7 @.@ 95 m ( 26 @.@ 1 ft ) in height were reported . One man perished on his roof while trying to fix his antenna . Two rivers were flooded but all in all , damage was minimal . 
 Due to its slow motion , Intense Tropical cyclone Connie deluged Reunion with heavy rains for several days before suddenly tampering off on January 29 . Throughout the passage of the cyclone , many locations recorded wind gusts in excess of 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) , highlighted by 133 km / h ( 83 mph ) in Le Port , 155 km / h ( 95 mph ) in <unk> France , and 21 km / h ( 13 mph ) in Maida . Moreover , a peak rainfall total of 1 @,@ 752 mm ( 69 @.@ 0 in ) was measured in Commerson , 1 @,@ 296 mm ( 51 @.@ 0 in ) of which occurred in a 24 ‑ hour time frame . Many roads across Reunion were damaged . Power was knocked out to 40 @,@ 000 customers while more than 100 homes were demolished . Two persons were killed , including a young man that fell while trying to observe the cyclone . A total of 600 people were reported homeless ; roughly 300 people were evacuated . Although the agriculture sector suffered the most significant damages , overall , damage was minor . However , the French government later provided relief aid to Reunion as a result of the damage . 
 The non @-@ tropical remnants of Connie brought flooding to Southern Africa for several days . In Maputo , 328 mm ( 12 @.@ 9 in ) of rain fell within a day . Large sections of many neighborhoods were inundated . Roughly 20 @,@ 000 people were rendered homeless . The road that linked Maputo to South Africa was cut . The Ministry of Education was forced to delay the start of the school year . Following the floods , roughly 20 emergency shelters were opened . These rains help set the stage for additional flooding caused by Cyclone Leon – Eline and Cyclone Hudah . 
 = Cryptothecia rubrocincta = 
 Cryptothecia rubrocincta is a species of lichen in the <unk> family of fungi . The species is distributed in subtropical and tropical locations throughout the southeastern United States , as well as Central and South America , and has been collected infrequently in a few locales in Africa . The body of the lichen forms continuous , circular crust @-@ like patches on dead wood , readily recognizable by the prominent red pigment . The older , central region is covered with red , spherical to cylindrical granules . Moving outwards from the center , zones of color may be distinguished , the first gray @-@ green , the second white , and finally a bright red cottony rim . The red and green colors of this unmistakable woodland lichen give the appearance of a Christmas wreath , suggestive of its common North American name , the Christmas wreath lichen . The red pigment , called chiodectonic acid , is one of several chemicals the lichen produces to help tolerate inhospitable growing conditions . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The classification of the genus Cryptothecia has been unclear , and historically , C. rubrocincta has been placed in several different genera . Like all lichens , C. rubrocincta is an association of a fungus ( the mycobiont ) with a photosynthetic organism ( the photobiont ) , in this case , an algae . Initially , it was unknown whether the mycobiont component of C. rubrocincta was an ascomycete or a basidiomycete . Although the vast majority of lichen <unk> are from the Ascomycota , in 1937 German <unk> Friedrich Tobler believed the mycobiont to be a basidiomycete , because he interpreted some unusual microscopic structures to be clamp connections , structures associated only with the basidiomycete fungi . In another publication later that year , he specified the mycobiont to be a <unk> , and described the monotypic genus <unk> to supersede the old name <unk> sanguineum . Although Vernon <unk> corroborated the presence of clamp connections in the species when he studied the species ' cytology in 1967 , other researchers did not find clamp connections in specimens collected from different countries . Further doubt was cast on the possibility of a basidiomycete mycobiont with the discovery of the <unk> confluentic acid in 1966 , concentric bodies in 1975 , and <unk> bodies in 1983 , as all of these characteristics are restricted to Ascomycetes . 
 The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature states that names of fungi adopted by Fries in Systema Mycologicum vols . 1 – 3 are sanctioned , that is , they are conserved against earlier homonyms and competing synonyms . This means that the name <unk> <unk> has priority over <unk> sanguinea . The type material of H. <unk> was examined by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in Berlin ; it has since been destroyed , probably during the Second World War . The drawing in <unk> 's 1820 publication serves as the lectotype . The species was transferred to the genus Cryptothecia by Swedish <unk> Göran Thor in 1991 , on the basis of its similarity with C. striata such as the thallus with radiate ridges , granular isidia , and presence of para @-@ <unk> ( <unk> acid in C. striata and confluentic acid in C. rubrocincta ) . 
 The red and green of C. rubrocincta give it a Christmas wreath look , hence its common North American name , the Christmas wreath lichen . The specific epithet is derived from the Latin words ruber " red " and <unk> " girdled / encircled " or " banded " . The other epithet sanguineum is the neuter form of the Latin adjective sanguineus " bloody " . 
 = = Description = = 
 Cryptothecia rubrocincta is a <unk> lichen , because it grows in the form of a surface crust . The thallus , or body of the lichen is spread out flat and can be either tightly to loosely attached to the growing surface . It is 0 @.@ 15 – 0 @.@ 30 mm thick , and can be smooth , or have low radiating ridges . The older , central region of the lichen surface has many reproductive structures called isidia ; they resemble granules that are 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 4 by 0 @.@ 1 mm . The species relies entirely on vegetative means to reproduce , and is not known to have any sexual structures . From the center outwards , three color zones can be differentiated in mature specimens ; the first grayish @-@ green , the second white , and finally a bright red cottony rim . 
 The lichen has a distinct <unk> — fibers of whitish fungal hyphae at the edge that lack photobiont , and which project beyond the thallus onto the growing surface . The <unk> is red to whitish in the inner part , red the in outer part . The surface of the thallus does not have a well @-@ defined cortex , an outer layer of well @-@ packed hyphae . The medulla ( a loosely arranged layer of hyphae below the cortex and photobiont zone ) is whitish but the lower part is red . It has few to many calcium oxalate crystals that are 3 – 8 μm diameter . The hyphae of the medulla have many such crystals on the walls , that are 1 – 2 μm in diameter . The algal photobiont ( technically a <unk> , as it is a green algal photosynthetic partner ) is from the genus Trentepohlia . Normally , the algae is long and filamentous ; when in the lichen state , it is divided into shorter filaments . The alga has a large chloroplast that contains droplets of beta @-@ carotene . The lichen is <unk> , meaning that the mycobiont and photobiont components are in well @-@ defined layers , with the photobiont in a more or less distinct zone between the upper cortex and the medulla . Cells are single or a few cells aggregated , with dimensions of about 8 – 15 by 5 – 11 μm . 
 The yeast <unk> mexicanus , an anamorphic member of the <unk> family , was discovered growing <unk> on the lichen in 2005 . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The lichen is widely distributed in the southeastern United States ; in 1954 the north border of its distribution was given as a line passing through southern Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Georgia . Although the northern limit was extended to southern Delaware , the author later revised his opinion , and the northern limit is thought to be North Carolina . In North Carolina , it is found on Smith Island , a notable location because it represents the northern limit of the distribution of cabbage palmetto ( Sabal palmetto ) . The presence of this 6 meter ( 20 ft ) tree interspersed among the dominant tree species Quercus virginiana give the island a subtropical appearance — consistent with the lichen 's preferred climate . 
 Cryptothecia rubrocincta is also widespread in tropical and subtropical areas of the West Indies and Central and South America . In South America in is found north of Chile and Argentina . It is rarer in Africa , having only been collected from three geographically widely separated mountain regions : São Tomé and Príncipe , Tanzania , and DR Congo . The lichen may be found at altitudes ranging from sea level to 2 @,@ 600 metres ( 8 @,@ 500 ft ) ( in Colombia ) . 
 The lichen typically grows on rough bark in sheltered and shaded habitats in moist and dense subtropical forests . More rarely , it is found on rocks or on leaves . In the USA it occurs in hammocks ( hardwood forests ) and swamps which have standing water , at least part of the year . It is also common in oak or oak @-@ pine scrub vegetation . The species is often associated with Cryptothecia striata in the USA . 
 = = Chemistry = = 
 Cryptothecia rubrocincta is easily recognized by the bright red pigment in the thallus . The pigment , first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904 , is called chiodectonic acid . The lichen also contains the colorless <unk> compound <unk> acid . A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones . The white crystalline zone contains calcium oxalate dihydrate , or <unk> , a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium @-@ rich surfaces . Some have suggested that the calcium oxalate serves in the organism 's survival strategy : the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments , and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores . Because the lichen grows on calcium @-@ poor surfaces , calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain , bird droppings , and airborne particles . 
 The chemicals in the red @-@ colored zone include an aromatic quinone , beta @-@ carotene , and chlorophyll . The quinone is deep @-@ red colored pigment chiodectonic acid , thought to function as a radiation <unk> ; in combination with beta @-@ carotene , which has an established role in cellular DNA repair following exposure of the organism to UV @-@ damage , such radiation <unk> are often found in lichens and in <unk> situations and are essential for survival . 
 The lighter @-@ colored pink zone , located on the inside of the red zone , contains a mixture of chiodectonic acid , beta @-@ carotene and calcium oxalate dihydrate , the red and white mixture of the chiodectonic acid and the calcium oxalate giving rise to the characteristically lighter color . 
 The elliptical brown @-@ colored flecks , which can be observed in both the red and pink zones of the thallus , are made of confluentic acid and calcium oxalate monohydrate . The monohydrate is thought to be a more chemically stable metabolic byproduct of calcium oxalate dihydrate ; the function of confluentic acid in the brown flecks is unclear . 
 = Impalement = 
 Impalement , as a method of execution , is the penetration of a human by an object such as a stake , pole , spear , or hook , often by complete or partial perforation of the torso . It was used particularly in response to " crimes against the state " and regarded across a number of cultures as a very harsh form of capital punishment and recorded in myth and art . Impalement was also used during wartime to suppress rebellion , punish traitors or collaborators , and as a punishment for breaches of military discipline . 
 Offenses where impalement was occasionally employed include : contempt for the state 's responsibility for safe roads and trade routes by committing highway robbery or grave robbery , violating state policies or monopolies , or subverting standards for trade . Offenders have also been impaled for a variety of cultural , sexual and religious reasons . 
 References to impalement in Babylonia and the Neo @-@ Assyrian Empire are found as early as the 18th century BC . Within the Ottoman Empire , this form of execution continued into the 20th century . 
 = = Methods = = 
 = = = Longitudinal impalement = = = 
 <unk> an individual along the body length has been documented in several cases , and the merchant Jean de <unk> provides an eyewitness account of this , from 17th century Egypt , in the case of a man condemned to death for the use of false weights : 
 They lay the Malefactor upon his Belly , with his Hands tied behind his Back , then they slit up his <unk> with a Razor , and throw into it a handful of Paste that they have in readiness , which immediately stops the Blood . After that they thrust up into his Body a very long Stake as big as a Mans Arm , sharp at the point and tapered , which they grease a little before ; when they have driven it in with a Mallet , till it come out at his Breast , or at his Head or Shoulders , they lift him up , and plant this Stake very <unk> in the Ground , upon which they leave him so exposed for a day . One day I saw a Man upon the Pale , who was Sentenced to continue so for three Hours alive and that he might not die too soon , the Stake was not thrust up far enough to come out at any part of his Body , and they also put a stay or rest upon the Pale , to hinder the weight of his body from making him sink down upon it , or the point of it from piercing him through , which would have presently killed him : In this manner he was left for some Hours , ( during which time he spoke ) and turning from one side to another , prayed those that passed by to kill him , making a thousand wry Mouths and Faces , because of the pain be suffered when he stirred himself , but after Dinner the Basha sent one to dispatch him ; which was easily done , by making the point of the Stake come out at his Breast , and then he was left till next Morning , when he was taken down , because he stunk <unk> . 
 = = = = Survival time = = = = 
 The survival time on the stake is quite <unk> reported , from a few seconds or minutes to a few hours or 1 to 3 days . The Dutch overlords at Batavia , present day Jakarta , seem to have been particularly proficient in prolonging the lifetime of the impaled , one witnessing a man surviving 6 days on the stake , another hearing from local surgeons that some could survive 8 or more days . A critical determinant for survival length seems to be precisely how the stake was inserted : If it went into the " interior " parts , vital organs could easily be damaged , leading to a swift death . However , by letting the stake follow the spine , the impalement procedure would not damage the vital organs , and the person could survive for several days . 
 = = = Transversal impalement = = = 
 Alternatively , the impalement could be transversally performed , for example in the frontal @-@ to @-@ dorsal direction , that is , from front ( through abdomen , chest or directly through the heart ) to back or vice versa 
 In the Holy Roman Empire ( and elsewhere in Central / Eastern Europe ) , women who killed their newborn could be liable to be placed in an open grave , and have a stake hammered into their heart . A detailed description of an execution in this manner comes from 17th century Košice ( then in Hungary , now in eastern Slovakia ) . A woman was to be executed for infanticide , the executioner had two assistants to help him . First , a grave , some one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half ell deep was dug . The woman was placed within it , her hands and feet secured by driving nails through them . Then , the executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face . He then placed and held vertically a wooden stave at her heart , while his assistants piled earth on the woman . Her head , though , was kept free of earth , at the behest of the clerics , because that would have quickened her death process . Once the earth had been piled upon her , the executioner grabbed with a pair of tongs a rod made of iron , which had been made red hot . He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden stave , and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in , the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman 's head . It is said that a scream was heard , and that the earth actually moved upwards for a moment , before all was over .

 Joseph Pitton de Tournefort , travelling on botanical research in the Levant 1700 – 1702 , observed both ordinary longitudinal impalement , but also a method called " gaunching " , in which the condemned is hoisted up by means of a rope over a bed of sharp metal hooks . He is then released , and depending on how the hooks enter his body , he may survive in impaled condition for a few days . Forty years earlier than de Tournefort , de Thévenot described much the same process , adding that it was seldom used because it was regarded as too cruel . Some 80 years prior to de <unk> , in 1579 , Hans Jacob Breuning von <unk> witnessed a variant of the gaunching ritual . A large iron hook was fixed on the horizontal cross @-@ bar of the gallows and the individual was forced upon this hook , piercing him from the abdomen through his back , so that he hung from it , hands , feet and head downward . On top of the cross bar , the executioner situated himself and performed various torture on the impaled man below him . 
 = = = = Hooks in the city wall = = = = 
 While gaunching as de Tournefort describes involves the erection of a scaffold , it seems that in the city of Algiers , hooks were embedded in the city walls , and on occasion , people were thrown upon them from the battlements . 
 Thomas Shaw , who was chaplain for the Levant Company stationed at Algiers during the 1720s , describes the various forms of executions practiced as follows : 
 " .. but the Moors and Arabs are either impaled for the same crime , or else they are hung up by the neck , over the battlements of the city walls , or else they are thrown upon the <unk> or hooks that are fixed all over the walls below , where sometimes they break from one hook to another , and hang in the most exquisite torments , thirty or forty hours . " 
 According to one source , these hooks in the wall as an execution method were introduced with the construction of the new city gate in 1573 . Before that time , gaunching as described by de Tournefort was in use . As for the actual frequency of throwing persons on hooks in Algiers , Capt. Henry <unk> notes that in his own 20 years of captivity there , he knew of only one case where a Christian slave who had murdered his master had met that fate , and " not above " two or three Moors besides . Taken captive in 1596 , the barber @-@ surgeon William Davies relates something of the heights involved when thrown upon hooks ( although it is somewhat unclear if this relates specifically to the city of Algiers , or elsewhere in the Barbary States ) : " Their <unk> is after this manner : he sitteth upon a wall , being five fathoms high , within two fathoms of the top of the wall ; right under the place where he sits , is a strong iron hook fastened , being very sharp ; then he is thrust off the wall upon this hook , with some part of his body , and there he <unk> , sometimes two or three days , before he <unk> . " Davies adds that " these deaths are very seldom " , but that he had personally witnessed it 
 = = = = Hanged by the ribs = = = = 
 A slightly variant way of executing people by means of impalement was to force an iron meat hook beneath a person 's ribs and hang him up to die slowly . This technique was in 18th century Ottoman @-@ controlled Bosnia called the <unk> , but the practice is also attested , for example , in 1770s Dutch Suriname as a punishment meted out to rebellious slaves .

 A recurring horror story on many websites and popular media outlets is that Japanese soldiers during World War II inflicted bamboo torture upon prisoners of war .

 The earliest known use of impalement as a form of execution occurred in civilizations of the ancient Near East .

In the late Isin / Larsa period , from about the same time , it seems that , in some city states , mere adultery on the wife 's part ( without murder of her husband mentioned ) could be punished by impalement . From the royal archives of the city of Mari ( at the Syrian @-@ Iraqi border by the western bank of Euphrates ) , most of it also roughly contemporary to Hammurabi , it is known that soldiers taken captive in war were on occasion impaled . Roughly contemporary with Babylonia under Hammurabi , king <unk> @-@ Palar @-@ <unk> of Elam , a country lying directly east of Babylonia in present @-@ day Iran , made official edicts in which he threatened the allies of his enemies with impalement , among other terrible fates . For acts of perceived great sacrilege , some individuals , in diverse cultures , have been impaled for their effrontery . For example , roughly 1200 BC , merchants of Ugarit express deep concern to each other that a fellow citizen is to be impaled in the Phoenician town Sidon , due to some " great sin " committed against the patron deity of Sidon .

 During Dynasty 19 , Merneptah had <unk> prisoners of war impaled ( " caused to be set upon a stake " ) to the south of Memphis , following an attempted invasion of Egypt during his Regnal Year 5 . The relevant determinative for <unk> ( " stake " ) depicts an individual transfixed though the abdomen . Other Egyptian kings employing <unk> include Sobekhotep II , Akhenaten , Seti , and Ramesses IX .

 Evidence by carvings and statues is found as well , for example from Neo @-@ Assyrian empire ( rough dating , 934 @-@ 609 BCE ) . The image of the impaled Judeans is a detail from the public commemoration of the Assyrian victory in 701 BC after the Siege of Lachish , under King Sennacherib ( <unk> @-@ 681 BC ) , who proceeded similarly against the inhabitants of Ekron during the same campaign . From Sennacherib 's father Sargon II 's time ( <unk> @-@ 705 BC ) , a relief from his palace at <unk> shows the impalement of 14 enemies during an attack on the city of <unk> . A peculiarity about the " Neo @-@ Assyrian " way of impaling was that the stake was " driven into the body immediately under the ribs " , rather than along the full body length . For the Neo @-@ Assyrians , mass executions seem to have been not only designed to instill terror and to enforce obedience , but also , it can seem , as proofs of their might that they took pride in . For example , Neo @-@ Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II ( <unk> @-@ 859 BC ) was evidently proud enough of his bloody work that he committed it to monument and eternal memory as follows : 
 " I cut off their hands , I burned them with fire , a pile of the living men and of heads over against the city gate I set up , men I impaled on stakes , the city I destroyed and devastated , I turned it into mounds and ruin heaps , the young men and the maidens in the fire I burned " 
 Paul Kern , in his ( 1999 ) " Ancient Siege Warfare " provides some statistics on how different Neo @-@ Assyrian kings from the times of Ashurnasirpal II commemorated their punishments of rebels 
 Although impalement of rebels and enemies is particularly well @-@ attested from Neo @-@ Assyrian times , the 14th century BC Mitanni king <unk> charges his predecessor , the usurper <unk> III for having delivered unto the ( Middle ) Assyrians several nobles , who had them promptly impaled . Some scholars have said , though , that it is only with king Ashur @-@ bel @-@ kala ( <unk> @-@ 1056 ) that we have solid evidence that punishments like flaying and impaling came into use . From the Middle Assyrian period , we have evidence about impalement as a form of punishment relative to other types of perceived crimes as well . The law code discovered and deciphered by Dr. Otto Schroeder contains in its paragraph 51 the following injunction against abortion : 
 If a woman with her consent brings on a miscarriage , they seize her , and determine her guilt . On a stake they impale her , and do not bury her ; and if through the miscarriage she dies , they likewise impale her and do not bury her 
 = = = = <unk> Biblical evidence = = = = 
 Some controversy exist between different Bible translations concerning the actual fate of the 5th century BC Persian minister Haman and his ten sons , whether they were impaled or hanged For example , the English Standard Version , Esther 5 : 14 opts for hanging , whereas The New International Reader 's version opts for impalement . The Assyriologist Paul Haupt opts for impalement in his 1908 essay " Critical notes on Esther " , while Benjamin Shaw has an extended discussion of the topic on the website <unk> from 2012 . 
 Other passages in the Bible allude to the practice of impalement , such as II Samuel 21 : 9 , concerning the fate of the sons of Saul . 
 " And they handed them over to the <unk> , and they impaled them <unk> ( <unk> ) on the mountain before <unk> , and all seven of them fell together . And they were killed in the first days of the harvest , at the beginning of the barley harvest . " < 
 Although conclusive evidence might be wanting either way for whether Hebrew Law allowed for impalement , or just hanging , the Neo @-@ Assyrian method of impalement as seen in the carvings could , perhaps , equally easily be seen as a form of hanging upon a pole , rather than focusing upon the stake 's actual penetration of the body .

 Transversal impalement 
 Within the Holy Roman Empire , in article 131 of the 1532 Constitutio <unk> Carolina , the following punishment was stated for women found guilty of infanticide . Generally , they should be drowned , but the law code allowed for , in particularly severe cases , that the old punishment could be implemented . That is , the woman would be buried alive , and then a stake would be driven through her heart . Similarly , burial alive , combined with transversal impalement is attested as an early execution method for people found guilty of adultery . For example , from the 1348 statutes of Zwickau , it seems that an adulterous couple could be punished in the following way : They were to be placed on top of each other in a grave , with a layer of thorns between them . Then , a single stake was to be hammered through them . A similar punishment by impalement for a proven male adulterer is mentioned in a 13th @-@ century ordinance for Bohemian mining town Iglau , whereas in a 1340 Vienna statute , the husband of a woman caught in flagrante in adultery could , if he wished to , demand that his wife and her lover be impaled , alternatively demand a monetary restitution . Occasionally , women found guilty of witchcraft have been condemned to be impaled . In 1587 Kiel , 101 @-@ year @-@ old Sunde Bohlen was , on being condemned as a witch , buried alive , and afterwards had a stake driven through her heart . 
 Rapists of virgins and children are also attested to have been buried alive , with a stake driven through them . In one such judicial tradition , the rapist was to be placed in an open grave , and the rape victim was ordered to make the three first strokes on the stake herself ; the executioners then finishing the impalement procedure . Serving as an example of the fate of a child molester , in August 1465 in Zurich , Switzerland , Ulrich Moser was condemned to be impaled , for having sexually violated six girls between the ages four and nine . His clothes were taken off , and he was placed on his back . His arms and legs were stretched out , each secured to a pole . Then a stake was driven through his navel down into the ground . Thereafter , people left him to die . 
 Longitudinal impalement 
 Cases of longitudinal impalement can be found typically in the context of war or as a punishment of robbers , the latter being attested as practice in Central and Eastern Europe . 
 Individuals perceived of collaborating with the enemy have , on occasion , been impaled . For example , in 1632 during the Thirty Years ' War , the German officer Fuchs was impaled on suspicion of defecting to the Swedes , a Swedish corporal was likewise impaled for trying to defect to the Germans . In 1654 , under the Ottoman siege of the Venetian garrison at Crete , several peasants were impaled for supplying provisions to the besieged . Likewise in 1685 , some Christians were impaled by the Hungarians for having provided supplies to the Turks . 
 In 1677 , a particularly brutal German General Kops leading the forces of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I designed to keep Hungary dominated by the Germans , rather than to become dominated by the Turks , began impaling and quartering his Hungarian subjects / opponents . An opposing general for the Hungarians , <unk> , responded in kind , by flaying alive Imperial troops , and fixing sharp iron hooks in fortress walls , upon which he threw captured Germans to be impaled . Finally , Emperor Leopold I had had enough of the mutual bloodshed , and banished Kops in order to establish a needed cessation of hostilities . After the Treaty of The Hague ( 1720 ) , Sicily fell under Habsburg rule , but the locals deeply resented the German overlords . One parish priest ( who exhorted his parishioners to kill the Germans ) is said to have broken into joy when a German soldier arrived at his village , exclaiming it was gone a whole eight days since last he killed a German , and shot the soldier off his horse . The priest was later impaled . In the short @-@ lived 1784 Horea Revolt against the Austrians and Hungarians , the rebels gained hold of two officers they promptly impaled . On their side , the imperial troops got hold of Horea 's 13 @-@ year @-@ old son , and impaled him . That seems to have merely inflamed the rebel leader 's determination , although the revolt was quashed shortly afterwards . 
 From 1748 and onwards , German regiments organized manhunts on " robbers " in Hungary / Croatia , impaling those caught . 
 = = = = Execution of Paul Wasansky in 1570 = = = = 
 Occasionally , individual murderers were perceived to have been so heinous that standard punishments like beheading or to be broken on the wheel were not regarded as sufficiently commensurate with their crimes , and extended rituals of execution that might include impalement were devised . The case of Pavel <unk> ( Paul Wasansky in German transcript ) may serve as an example here . 
 Paul Wasansky , who in 1570 was executed in <unk> , in present @-@ day Czech Republic , on account of 124 confessed murders ( he was a roaming highwayman ) , underwent a particularly gruelling execution procedure : First , his limbs were cut off and his nipples were ripped off with glowing pincers . He was then flayed , afterwards impaled and finally roasted alive . The pamphlet , which purports to give Wasansky 's verbatim confession , does not record how Wasansky was apprehended , nor what means of torture was used to extract his confessions . 
 = = = = Dracula = = = = 
 During the 15th century , Vlad III ( " Dracula " ) , Prince of Wallachia , is credited as the first notable figure to prefer this method of execution during the late medieval period , and became so notorious for its liberal employment that among his several nicknames he was known as Vlad the Impaler . After being orphaned , betrayed , forced into exile and pursued by his enemies , he retook control of Wallachia in 1456 . He dealt harshly with his enemies , especially those who had betrayed his family in the past , or had profited from the misfortunes of Wallachia . Though a variety of methods was employed , he has been most associated with his use of impalement . The liberal use of capital punishment was eventually extended to Saxon settlers , members of a rival clan , and criminals in his domain , whether they were members of the boyar nobility or peasants , and eventually to any among his subjects that displeased him . Following the multiple campaigns against the invading Ottoman Turks , Vlad would never show mercy to his prisoners of war . After The Night Attack of Vlad Ţepeş in mid @-@ June 1462 failed to assassinate the Ottoman sultan , the road to Târgovişte , the capital of Vlad 's principality of Wallachia , eventually became inundated in a " forest " of 20 @,@ 000 impaled and decaying corpses , and it is reported that Mehmet II 's invading army of Turks turned back to Constantinople in 1462 after encountering thousands of impaled corpses along the Danube River . Woodblock prints from the era portray his victims impaled from either the frontal or the dorsal aspect , but not vertically . 
 As an example of how Vlad Țepeș soon became iconic for all horrors unimaginable , the following pamphlet from 1521 pours out putative incidents like this one : 
 He let children be roasted ; those , their mothers were forced to eat . And ( he ) cut off the breasts of women ; those , their husbands were forced to eat . After that , he had them all impaled 
 = = = Ottoman Empire = = = 
 Longitudinal impalement is an execution method often attested within the Ottoman Empire , for a variety of offenses . 
 = = = = Siege of Constantinople = = = = 
 The Ottoman Empire used impalement during , and before , the last siege of Constantinople in 1453 . For example , during the buildup phase to the great siege the year before , in 1452 , the sultan declared that all ships sailing up or down through the Bosphorus had to anchor at his fortress there , for inspection . One Venetian captain , Antonio Rizzo , sought to defy the ban , but his ship was hit by a cannonball . He and his crew were picked up from the waters , the crew members to be beheaded ( or sawn asunder according to Niccolò Barbaro ) , whereas Rizzo was impaled . In the early days of the siege in May 1453 , contingents of the Ottoman army made mop @-@ up operations at minor fortifications like Therapia and Studium . The surrendered soldiers , some 40 individuals from each place , were impaled . 
 = = = = Civil crimes = = = = 
 Within the Ottoman Empire , some civil crimes ( rather than rebel activity / treasonous behavior ) , such as highway robbery , might be punished by impalement . For some periods at least , executions for civil crimes were claimed to have been rather rare in the Ottoman Empire . For example , Aubry de La <unk> , lived in the realm for 14 years from 1699 to 1713 and claimed that he hadn 't heard of twenty thieves in Constantinople during that time . As for highway robbers , who sure enough had been impaled , Aubry heard of only 6 such cases during his residence there . Staying at Aleppo from 1740 – 54 , Alexander Russell notes that in the 20 years gone by , there were no more than " half a dozen " public executions there . Jean de Thévenot , traveling in the Ottoman Empire and its territories like Egypt in the late 1650s , emphasizes the regional variations in impalement frequency . Of Constantinople and Turkey , de Thévenot writes that impalement was " not much practised " and " very rarely put in practice . " An exception he highlighted was the situation of Christians in Constantinople . If a Christian spoke or acted out against the " Law of Mahomet " , or consorted with a Turkish woman , or broke into a mosque , then he might face impalement unless he converted to Islam . In contrast , de Thévenot says that in Egypt impalement was a " very ordinary punishment " against the Arabs there , whereas Turks in Egypt were strangled in prison instead of being publicly executed like the natives . Thus , the actual frequency of impalement within the Ottoman Empire varied greatly , not only from time to time , but also from place to place , and between different population groups in the empire . 
 Highway robbers were still impaled into the 1830s , but one source says the practice was rare by then . Travelling to Smyrna and Constantinople in 1843 , Stephen <unk> was told by a man who witnessed the event that " just a few years ago " , a dozen or so robbers were impaled at Adrianople . All of them , however , had been strangled prior to impalement . Writing around 1850 , the archaeologist Austen Henry Layard mentions that the latest case he was acquainted with happened " about ten years ago " in Baghdad , on four rebel Arab sheikhs . 
 Impalement of pirates , rather than highway robbers , is also occasionally recorded . In October 1767 , for example , Hassan Bey , who had preyed on Turkish ships in the Euxine Sea for a number of years , was captured and impaled , even though he had offered 500 @.@ 000 ducats for his pardon . 
 = = = = <unk> and rebels in Greece = = = = 
 During the Ottoman rule of Greece , impalement became an important tool of psychological warfare , intended to put terror into the peasant population . By the 18th century , Greek bandits turned guerrilla insurgents ( known as klephts ) became an increasing annoyance to the Ottoman government . Captured klephts were often impaled , as were peasants that harbored or aided them . Victims were publicly impaled and placed at highly visible points , and had the intended effect on many villages who not only refused to help the klephts , but would even turn them in to the authorities . The Ottomans engaged in active campaigns to capture these insurgents in 1805 and 1806 , and were able to enlist Greek villagers , eager to avoid the stake , in the hunt for their outlaw countrymen . 
 Impalement was , on occasion , aggravated with being set over a fire , the impaling stake acting as a spit , so that the impaled victim might be roasted alive . Among other severities , Ali Pasha , an Albanian @-@ born Ottoman noble who ruled Ioannina , had rebels , criminals , and even the descendants of those who had wronged him or his family in the past , impaled and roasted alive . For example , Thomas Smart Hughes , visiting Greece and Albania in 1812 – 13 , says the following about his stay in Ioannina : 
 " Here criminals have been roasted alive over a slow fire , impaled , and skinned alive ; others have had their extremities chopped off , and some have been left to perish with the skin of the face stripped over their necks . At first I doubted the truth of these assertions , but they were abundantly confirmed to me by persons of undoubted veracity . Some of the most respectable inhabitants of <unk> assured me that they had sometimes conversed with these wretched victims on the very stake , being prevented from yielding to their torturing requests for water by fear of a similar fate themselves . Our own resident , as he was once going into the <unk> of <unk> , saw a Greek priest , the leader of a gang of robbers , nailed alive to the outer wall of the palace , in sight of the whole city . " 
 During the Greek War of Independence ( 1821 – 1832 ) , Greek revolutionaries or civilians were tortured and executed by impalement . A German witness of the Constantinople massacre ( April 1821 ) narrates the impalement of about 65 Greeks by Turkish mob . Other Greeks had been impaled during the first months of the insurrection in Patras , as it is recorded in the diary of the French consul Hughes Pouqueville and published by his brother François Pouqueville . Athanasios <unk> , a <unk> and later a rebel military commander , was captured after the Battle of <unk> ( 1821 ) , near Thermopylae , and after refusing to convert to Islam and join the Ottoman army , he was impaled . <unk> became a martyr for a Greek independence and was later honored as a national hero . 
 = = = = Rebels elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire = = = = 
 <unk> perceived rebels was an attested practice in other parts of the empire as well , such as the 1809 quelling of a Bosnian revolt , and during the Serbian Revolution ( 1804 – 1835 ) against the Ottoman Empire , about 200 Serbs were impaled in Belgrade in 1814 . Historian James J. Reid , in his Crisis of the Ottoman Empire : Prelude to Collapse 1839 – 1878 , notes several instances of later use , in particular in times of crises , ordered by military commanders ( if not , that is , directly ordered by the supreme authority possessed by the sultan ) . He notes late instances of impalement during rebellions ( rather than cases of robbery ) like the Bosnian revolt of 1852 , during the Cretan insurrection of 1866 – 69 , and during the insurrections in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1876 – 77 . In the Nobel Prize @-@ winning novel The Bridge on the Drina , by Ivo Andrić , in the third chapter is described impalement of a Bosnian Serb , who was trying to sabotage the bridge 's construction . 
 = = = = Occurrences in genocides = = = = 
 Allegations of impalement during the Assyrian and Armenian genocides have also been recorded . 
 Aurora <unk> , a survivor of the Armenian genocide of 1915 – 1923 , recalled sixteen young Armenian girls being " crucified " by their Ottoman tormentors . The film " Auction of Souls " ( 1919 ) , which was based on her book " <unk> Armenia " , showed the victims nailed to crosses . However , almost 70 years later <unk> revealed that the scene was inaccurate and went on to describe what was actually an impalement : 
 " The Turks didn 't make their crosses like that . The Turks made little pointed crosses . They took the clothes off the girls . They made them bend down , and after raping them , they made them sit on the pointed wood , through the vagina . That 's the way they killed - the Turks . Americans have made it a more civilized way . They can 't show such terrible things . " 
 A Russian clergyman visiting ravaged Christian villages in northwestern Persia during the Assyrian genocide found the remains of several impaled people . He notes : " The bodies were so firmly fixed , in some instances , that the stakes could not be withdrawn ; it was necessary to saw them off and bury the victims as they were . "

 Born in Chester , Johnson began his career with Crewe Alexandra and Manchester United 's academies . He had loan spells with Royal Antwerp , Coventry City and Crewe Alexandra , before he was released by Manchester United in 2006 and joined Bradford City , where he played 64 league games in two seasons . He was released from Bradford in 2008 , and after initially turning down a move to Chester City , he was given a trial at Crewe , which was unsuccessful , and instead he joined Chester where he spent six months before his contract was terminated to allow him to move to Austin Aztex . His form during two seasons in the United Soccer Leagues First Division won him a transfer to Portland Timbers at the end of the 2010 season .

 Johnson was born in Chester , England , on 20 September 1984 . He attended Boughton Heath Primary School , <unk> High School and The Bishops ' Blue Coat Church of England High School in the city . Despite growing up as an Everton supporter , Johnson started his football career at Crewe Alexandra 's academy at the age of 10 . In 1999 , he signed for Premier League side Manchester United as a junior player .

 Johnson signed as a trainee at Manchester United in 2001 . Two years later , he was part of their FA Youth Cup @-@ winning team , scoring in the final against Middlesbrough , and had his first involvement with the first team . He made his debut for United on 28 October 2003 against Leeds United when he came on as a 112th @-@ minute substitute in a 3 – 2 League Cup victory at Elland Road . 
 Johnson was loaned out to the Belgian club Royal Antwerp in January 2004 where he made 11 appearances , scoring five goals , including a 20 @-@ yard strike on his debut against <unk> @-@ Zolder . In July 2004 , he was sent on loan to Championship @-@ side Coventry City for the 2004 – 05 season in order to gain first @-@ team experience . He scored on his Coventry debut in a 2 – 0 victory against Sunderland on 7 August 2004 , before he scored a second later that month in a 4 – 1 defeat of Nottingham Forest . Johnson did not score again until October , when he scored three times in four games , but they proved to be his last goals of the season . He finished his stay with Coventry with 26 appearances . 
 In July 2005 , Johnson again moved on loan this time returning to Crewe Alexandra in a six @-@ month deal . It took him eight games to score his first goal which came in a 1 – 1 draw with Plymouth Argyle on 13 September 2005 . Three more goals followed by the end of 2005 including one on Boxing Day against Hull City , who then offered him a permanent deal . Hull and Manchester United agreed a fee for Johnson but he decided to extend his loan deal at Crewe until the end of the 2005 – 06 season . It was not until the last game of the season against Millwall that he scored another to bring his tally to five from 22 games . Having failed to make an impact at Manchester United , Johnson was among seven United players given a free transfer at the end of the 2005 – 06 season . He was offered a contract at Crewe , but also attracted interest from Barnsley and Bradford City , the latter of whom he joined on a two @-@ year deal in June 2006 . 
 = = = Bradford City = = = 
 The start of Johnson 's career at League One side Bradford City was marred by an ankle ligament injury in a pre @-@ season friendly at Boston United which was expected to keep him out of the first month of the season . He recovered to make his debut in City 's 2006 – 07 season 's opening game at Nottingham Forest as a late substitute . Two weeks later he scored his first Bradford goals by netting twice against his former club Crewe in a 3 – 0 Bradford victory . Johnson struggled for goals at City , and had only scored another two by the time he was ruled out for a month after going off at half @-@ time against Chesterfield on 16 December 2006 with a shin injury . He returned to the City team after a six @-@ game absence for a Friday night game with Tranmere Rovers , which ended 1 – 1 . He had a goal disallowed against Yeovil Town a week later for offside . Following a poor run of form , City manager Colin Todd was sacked , with his replacement David Wetherall converting Johnson from a striker to a midfielder after an injury to Marc Bridge @-@ Wilkinson . However , City were relegated after a defeat to Chesterfield with Johnson finishing the season with just four goals . 
 At the start of the 2007 – 08 season , new manager Stuart McCall continued to employ Johnson in a midfield role , and he was rewarded with goals in back @-@ to @-@ back games and the club 's player of the month in September . In November , he was ruled out for 11 weeks because of a back injury , before he was sidelined again when he gashed his shin in his comeback game against Wrexham on 26 January 2008 . Johnson returned two weeks later as a second @-@ half substitute against Bury . He was used in his former striker 's role later in the season , and scored his sixth league goal in a 1 – 0 victory over Morecambe on 5 April 2008 . Johnson scored again three days later in a 1 – 1 draw with Barnet , as he tried to secure a new contract with Bradford . However , on 29 April 2008 , Johnson was deemed to be surplus to requirements at Valley Parade and was released by manager Stuart McCall along with 13 other Bradford players . McCall said releasing Johnson was one of the hardest decisions in his first year as manager , adding : " It went right down to the wire with Eddie . He 's got terrific energy , a good engine and has enjoyed himself at this club . " Johnson played a total of 71 games in all competitions for City , scoring eight goals .

 In June 2008 , Johnson was offered a two @-@ year contract by fellow League Two side Chester City , but two weeks later , he turned down the deal . Instead he returned to Crewe Alexandra on trial after he and his mother went to see coach Dario Gradi , and scored twice in a 4 – 1 pre @-@ season friendly victory over Quorn on 16 July 2008 . Despite spending the rest of the summer with Crewe , the club decided not to offer Johnson a full @-@ time contract , because coach Steve Holland felt he was not better than the club 's other forwards . 
 Instead , Johnson was given another chance with Chester City , with whom he trained in the run up to the start of the 2008 – 09 season . He scored in a friendly against an Everton reserve team , but despite the club wanting to sign Johnson , the transfer was put on hold because of the club 's salary cap . Johnson had to wait a number of weeks to sign for Chester , after a deal to take Paul Rutherford to Northwich Victoria , freeing up money to pay Johnson , failed to go through before the 2008 summer transfer deadline closed . Johnson finally signed for Chester on 15 October , agreeing a two @-@ year contract with his hometown club . His debut came three days later in a home game with Port Vale , with Chester losing 2 – 1 , when he had two opportunities to score and was substituted late in the second half . His first goal for Chester was a consolation goal in a 2 – 1 defeat to Morecambe on 15 November . He missed four weeks out through injury , which coincided with the club 's improvement in form under new manager Mark Wright , until he returned as a last @-@ minute substitute against his former side Bradford City . 
 = = = Austin Aztex = = = 
 The following month , with Chester in financial hardship , Johnson was allowed to talk to United Soccer Leagues First Division side Austin Aztex , managed by Adrian Heath , who was caretaker manager during Johnson 's loan spell at Coventry City . Johnson 's contract was terminated by Chester City on the final day of the January transfer window to allow him to move to the Austin Aztex . His last game for Chester had been during December ; he played just 11 times during his six months with Chester , scoring only once . 
 Johnson 's move to Austin Aztex was finalised in March and completed their initial starting side , which included fellow English players Alex Tapp and Gifton Noel @-@ Williams and Welshman Gareth Evans . Upon Johnson 's transfer , team manager Adrian Heath said : " I think it 's fair to say that Eddie has lost his way recently and I hope we can get him back on the right path to where he is again one of the bright young players in English football . " Johnson played in the club 's first game , which was a 2 – 0 friendly defeat to Major League Soccer 's New England Revolution and scored in another pre @-@ season match . Johnson scored his first goal for Austin on 25 April against fellow expansion side the Cleveland City Stars when he scored in the 13th minute of play . Johnson scored his second goal in the final minute of the match . In the 2009 season , Johnson played 22 league matches , scoring five goals making him the Aztex leading goalscorer , but he was forced to miss part of the season because of work permit problems after he returned to England with Evans . Johnson also played in two of the Aztex 's three US Open Cup matches , playing in the first round , scoring the second goal in a 2 – 0 win over Mississippi <unk> and in Austin 's 2 – 0 defeat to Houston Dynamo in the third round . The Austin Chronicle named Johnson the city 's best player . The newspaper 's citation said : " he 's been out there hustling every game and providing leadership and a steadying influence on and off the field . At 24 , with a background that includes Manchester United and English national youth teams , he might not be with us much longer , but it 's a treat while it lasts . " He went on to win one of the club 's player of the season awards . 
 During the close @-@ season , Johnson sought a possible new club back in England , and before the start of the 2010 season in America , he was given a trial with Major League Soccer side Seattle Sounders FC joining them for their pre @-@ season training camp . Having trained with Sounders , Johnson decided to stay with Austin Aztex and signed a new two @-@ year contract . In the first game of the Aztex season , Johnson hit the goalpost with a 20 @-@ yard curling shot , but Lawrence <unk> scored with the rebound , helping the Aztex to a 2 – 0 victory against Montreal Impact . During May , Johnson scored five goals , including two in a 3 – 3 draw with Tampa Bay and made two assists to help Austin record an unbeaten spell . He again scored two goals in a 2 – 1 Aztex victory over Miami and helped take his team to the top of the table by being the club 's leading goalscorer throughout the campaign . Heath also used him in his original position in attack , including as a sole striker in a defeat to Puerto Rico Islanders . It was a result that saw the Aztex lose their top spot for the first time in three months . A week later , Johnson scored his tenth goal of the season to give his side their fourth win in five games by defeating Carolina <unk> 3 – 2 .

 Johnson 's form for the Aztex attracted the attention of the Portland Timbers , a Major League Soccer expansion side for the 2011 season . At the end of the 2010 league season , Johnson was announced as one of the Timbers first four signings , along with Steve Cronin , Ryan Pore and Bright Dike . Because Portland had second draft pick behind fellow expansion side Vancouver Whitecaps , they announced they had previously signed Johnson , by taking him to their former USL side before the transfer deadline on 14 August and loaning him back to the Aztex for the remainder of the 2010 season .

 25 Images of a Man 's Passion , or The Passion of a Man is the first wordless novel by Flemish artist Frans Masereel ( 1889 – 1972 ) , first published in 1918 under the French title 25 images de la passion d 'un homme . The silent story is about a young working @-@ class man who leads a revolt against his employer . The first of dozens of such works by Masereel , the book is considered to be the first wordless novel , a genre that saw its greatest popularity in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s . Masereel followed the book in 1919 with his best @-@ known work , Passionate Journey . 
 Masereel had grown up reading revolutionary socialist literature , and expressed his politics in A Man 's Passion ; the work is also filled with religious imagery , as with the Common Man taking the role of the martyred Christ . It owed its visual style to Expressionism and mediaeval woodcuts . The book was popular , particularly in German editions , which had introductions by writers Max Brod , Hermann Hesse , and Thomas Mann . 
 = = Background = = 
 Frans Masereel ( 1889 – 1972 ) was born into a French @-@ speaking family in Blankenberge , Belgium . When he was five his father died , and his mother remarried to a doctor in Ghent , whose political beliefs left an impression on the young Masereel . Masereel grew up reading Marxist , socialist , and anarchist works by such writers as Karl Marx and Peter Kropotkin , and often accompanied his stepfather in socialist demonstrations . After a year at the Ghent Academy of Fine Arts in 1907 , Masereel left to study art on his own in Paris . During World War I he volunteered as a translator for the Red Cross in Geneva , drew newspaper political cartoons , and copublished a magazine called Les <unk> , in which he published his first woodcut prints . 
 In the early 20th century there was a revival in interest in mediaeval woodcuts , particularly in religious books such as the Biblia pauperum . The woodcut is a less refined medium than the wood engraving that replaced it — artists of the time took to the rougher woodcut to express angst and frustration . From 1917 Masereel began publishing books of woodcut prints , using similar imagery to make political statements on the strife of the common people rather than to illustrate the lives of Christ and the saints . In 1918 he created the first such book to feature a narrative , 25 Images of a Man 's Passion , which is thus the earliest example of the wordless novel genre . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 25 Images of a Man 's Passion tells of a young man who protests injustice against the working class in an industrialized society . The man is born to an unwed mother , struggles to make a living , and drinks and whores with his coworkers . He educates himself by reading and talking with his coworkers , and is executed by the authorities for leading a revolt against his employer .

 = = Style and analysis = = 
 The title and content of the book have biblical resonances with the mediaeval woodcuts from which they draw inspiration . In line with Masereel 's politics , the Common Man is martyred instead of Christ ; during his trial , Christ on the crucifix shines light upon the man . The cover of the German edition depicts the main character burdened Christ @-@ like with a crucifix . 
 Visually , the book owes much to Expressionism , though experts disagree on whether to label Masereel 's work Expressionist ; critic Lothar Lang finds Masereel 's revolutionary politics to set Masereel apart from the Expressionists . Perry Willet finds parallels between the story arc of Masereel 's book and that of Expressionist playwright Ernst Toller 's The Transformation ( 1919 ) , though Masereel 's work was the more political — Toller lacked Masereel 's commitment to socialism . Socialist themes of the martyrdom of the working class were common in wordless novels ; with the city as a backdrop to a worker 's struggle against oppression , the book set the tone and themes for future wordless novels by Masereel and other artists , such as the American Lynd Ward . 
 = = Publication and reception = = 
 Printed from twenty @-@ five woodcut blocks , the book was first released in 1918 by Édition de <unk> , a Swiss publishing house of which Masereel was a co @-@ sponsor . It was first offered as a numbered collectors ' edition , and followed by trade editions . Kurt Wolff produced an inexpensive German edition ( Die Passion eines Menschen ) in 1921 . The German edition was particularly popular , and its several editions had introductions by writers Max Brod , Hermann Hesse , and Thomas Mann . In the same Expressionistic style , Masereel followed Man 's Passion with Passionate Journey ( 1919 ) , The Sun ( 1919 ) , Story Without Words ( 1920 ) , and The Idea ( 1920 ) .

From that moment on he is regarded as a superhero , and must later thwart the plans of the evil Dr. Siddhant . The film is inspired from the Hollywood film Paycheck . 
 Krrish was conceived to be a film of global significance and a trendsetter in Indian cinema , with visual effects on par with those from Hollywood . To that end , the effects team was aided by Hollywood 's Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma , and the stunts were choreographed by Chinese martial arts film expert Tony Ching . The music was composed by Rajesh Roshan , with the background score by Salim @-@ Sulaiman . Filming was done to a large extent in Singapore as well as India . The film was released worldwide in June 2006 at a cost of over ₹ 450 million ( US $ 6 @.@ 7 million ) and on 1000 prints , both near @-@ record amounts for an Indian film at the time .

Krishna saves Priya from a hang glider accident and falls in love with her when spending time with her . 
 After returning home to Singapore , Priya and Honey are fired by their boss ( Archana Puran Singh ) for taking a non @-@ permitted extension of 5 @-@ days in their vacation . In order to keep their jobs , Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna . Aware of Krishna 's love towards her , Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her . Krishna 's grandmother objects to this , saying that people will want to take advantage of his abilities . She then explains that his father Rohit was hired by Dr. Siddhant Arya ( Naseeruddin Shah ) to design a computer that could see the future in order to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters . However , Rohit later found out that the purpose of the computer was not for good and he destroyed the machine . Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night , with Krishna 's mother dying of a broken heart shortly thereafter . Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers , so she permits him to go . In Singapore , during the program 's production , Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself much to the disappointment of Honey and Priya , who get fired again .

He invites Krishna and Priya to the Great Bombay Circus , where fire beaks during the performance . Several children remain trapped in the blaze , and Krishna gets faced with the dilemma of saving the children without revealing his abilities .

Chopra also confirmed the same , adding , " The story will start where Koi ... Mil Gaya ended . " Rakesh Roshan hoped that the film would be remembered as the first to prove that the Indian film industry is equal to Hollywood . He decided to push the story forward by focusing on the son of the previous films 's protagonist , who would inherit his father 's special abilities . The story combined elements of Hindu religion and ancient Indian texts ( the main character 's name Krishna alludes to the Hindu Lord Krishna ) , Chinese martial arts and Hollywood films to set itself up as a film of global significance . 
 Rakesh Roshan wanted Krrish to be a trendsetter in Indian cinema , with visual effects on par with Hollywood films . He hired Hollywood special effects experts Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma , who had both previously worked on such films as Independence Day , Godzilla and Sky Captain , to help create the visual effects for the film . Roshan also hired Hong Kong action director Tony Ching after admiring his work in Hero .

 Krrish was the first Indian film to be shot in Singapore under the Singapore Tourism Board 's Film @-@ in @-@ Singapore subsidy scheme , and more than 60 % of the film was shot there . Shooting was accomplished on location over a span of two months , from September to November 2005 .

The canopy had iron rods . But I missed those rods too . What do I say ? I guess the right word to describe the situation would be <unk> ( magic ) . " Roshan also suffered other injuries during the film 's production . He tore the hamstring in his right leg during a circus scene , singed his hair while running through fire in another action scene , and broke his thumb and toe during strenuous training for the wirework . 
 Indian firm Prasad EFX assigned a team of more than 100 VFX specialists to work with Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma to create the visual effects for the film . Included were sophisticated 3D modelling and computer animation , including whole body scans , 3D replicas of vehicles , fire sequences , complicated wire removals and compositing work . They prepared over 1 @,@ 200 VFX shots , accounting for approximately 90 minutes of screen time . Describing the effects , Rakesh Roshan stated , " If you liked the visual effects in Koi ...

 Krrish received mixed reviews from critics in India . Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama believed that the film surpassed expectations , but felt that there were issues with pacing in first hour .

He summarised , " Krrish neither has the sleek aura nor the deep @-@ rooted ideology of superheroes . What it does have is a super spirited performance from Hrithik Roshan , which is likely to appeal to children . And that 's worth a three @-@ star cheer . " Saibal Chatterjee wrote in the Hindustan Times that Krrish is a hackneyed , formulaic masala film , with special effects added on top , and hoped that this would not be the future of Bollywood . Rajeev Masand of CNN @-@ IBN condemned the screenplay and thought that the only thing that made the film watchable was the acting of Hrithik Roshan .

 USS Lexington ( CV @-@ 2 ) , nicknamed " Lady Lex " , was an early aircraft carrier built for the United States Navy . She was the lead ship of the Lexington class ; her only sister ship , Saratoga , was commissioned a month earlier . Originally designed as a battlecruiser , she was converted into one of the Navy 's first aircraft carriers during construction to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 , which essentially terminated all new battleship and battlecruiser construction . The ship entered service in 1928 and was assigned to the Pacific Fleet for her entire career . Lexington and Saratoga were used to develop and refine carrier tactics in a series of annual exercises before World War II . On more than one occasion these included successfully staged surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor , Hawaii . The ship 's turbo @-@ electric propulsion system allowed her to supplement the electrical supply of Tacoma , Washington , during a drought in late 1929 to early 1930 . She also delivered medical personnel and relief supplies to Managua , Nicaragua , after an earthquake in 1931 . 
 Lexington was at sea when the Pacific War began on 7 December 1941 , ferrying fighter aircraft to Midway Island . Her mission was cancelled and she returned to Pearl Harbor a week later . After a few days , she was sent to create a diversion from the force en route to relieve the besieged Wake Island garrison by attacking Japanese installations in the Marshall Islands . The island was forced to surrender before the relief force got close enough , and the mission was cancelled . A planned attack on Wake Island in January 1942 had to be cancelled when a submarine sank the oiler required to supply the fuel for the return trip . Lexington was sent to the Coral Sea the following month to block any Japanese advances into the area . The ship was spotted by Japanese search aircraft while approaching Rabaul , New Britain , and her aircraft shot down most of the Japanese bombers that attacked her . Together with the carrier Yorktown , she successfully attacked Japanese shipping off the east coast of New Guinea in early March . 
 Lexington was briefly refitted in Pearl Harbor at the end of the month and rendezvoused with Yorktown in the Coral Sea in early May . A few days later the Japanese began Operation Mo , the invasion of Port Moresby , Papua New Guinea , and the two American carriers attempted to stop the invasion forces . They sank the light aircraft carrier Shōhō on 7 May during the Battle of the Coral Sea , but did not encounter the main Japanese force of the carriers Shōkaku and Zuikaku until the next day . Aircraft from Lexington and Yorktown succeeded in badly damaging Shōkaku , but the Japanese aircraft crippled Lexington . Vapors from leaking aviation gasoline tanks sparked a series of explosions and fires that could not be controlled , and Lexington had to be scuttled by an American destroyer during the evening of 8 May to prevent her capture .

 Lexington was the fourth US Navy ship named after the 1775 Battle of Lexington , the first battle of the Revolutionary War . She was originally authorized in 1916 as a Lexington @-@ class battlecruiser , but construction was delayed so that higher @-@ priority anti @-@ submarine vessels and merchant ships , needed to ensure the safe passage of personnel and materiel to Europe during Germany 's U @-@ boat campaign , could be built . After the war the ship was extensively redesigned , partially as a result of British experience . Given the hull number of CC @-@ 1 , Lexington was laid down on 8 January 1921 by Fore River Shipbuilding Company of Quincy , Massachusetts . 
 Before the Washington Naval Conference concluded , the ship 's construction was suspended in February 1922 , when she was 24 @.@ 2 percent complete . She was re @-@ designated and re @-@ authorized as an aircraft carrier on 1 July 1922 . Her displacement was reduced by a total of 4 @,@ 000 long tons ( 4 @,@ 100 t ) , achieved mainly by the elimination of her main armament of eight 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) guns in four twin turrets ( including their heavy turret mounts , their armor , and other equipment ) . The main armor belt was retained , but was reduced in height to save weight . The general line of the hull remained unaltered , as did the torpedo protection system , because they had already been built , and it would have been too expensive to alter them . 
 The ship had an overall length of 888 feet ( 270 @.@ 7 m ) , a beam of 106 feet ( 32 @.@ 3 m ) , and a draft of 30 feet 5 inches ( 9 @.@ 3 m ) at deep load . Lexington had a standard displacement of 36 @,@ 000 long tons ( 36 @,@ 578 t ) and 43 @,@ 056 long tons ( 43 @,@ 747 t ) at deep load . At that displacement , she had a metacentric height of 7 @.@ 31 feet ( 2 @.@ 2 m ) . 
 Christened by Mrs. Theodore Douglas Robinson , the wife of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy , Lexington was launched on 3 October 1925 . She was commissioned on 14 December 1927 with Captain Albert Marshall in command . By 1942 , the ship had a crew of 100 officers and 1 @,@ 840 enlisted men and an aviation group totaling 141 officers and 710 enlisted men .

Aircraft repair shops , 108 feet ( 32 @.@ 9 m ) long , were aft of the hangar , and below them was a storage space for disassembled aircraft , 128 feet ( 39 @.@ 0 m ) long . Lexington was fitted with two hydraulically powered elevators on her centerline . The forward elevator 's dimensions were 30 by 60 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m × 18 @.@ 3 m ) and it had a capacity of 16 @,@ 000 pounds ( 7 @,@ 300 kg ) . The aft elevator had a capacity of only 6 @,@ 000 pounds ( 2 @,@ 700 kg ) and measured 30 by 36 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m × 11 @.@ 0 m ) . <unk> was stored in eight compartments of the torpedo protection system , and their capacity has been quoted as either 132 @,@ 264 US gallons ( 500 @,@ 670 l ; 110 @,@ 133 imp gal ) or 163 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 620 @,@ 000 l ; 136 @,@ 000 imp gal ) . 
 Lexington was initially fitted with electrically operated arresting gear designed by Carl Norden that used both fore @-@ and @-@ aft and transverse wires . The longitudinal wires were intended to prevent aircraft from being blown over the side of the ship while the transverse wires slowed them to a stop . This system was authorized to be replaced by the hydraulically operated Mk 2 system , without longitudinal wires , on 11 August 1931 . Four improved Mk 3 units were added in 1934 , giving the ship a total of eight arresting wires and four barriers intended to prevent aircraft from crashing into parked aircraft on the ship 's bow . After the forward flight deck was widened in 1936 , an additional eight wires were added there to allow aircraft to land over the bow if the landing area at the stern was damaged . The ship was built with a 155 @-@ foot ( 47 @.@ 2 m ) , flywheel @-@ powered , F Mk II aircraft catapult , also designed by Norden , on the starboard side of the bow . This catapult was strong enough to launch a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 4 @,@ 500 kg ) aircraft at a speed of 48 knots ( 89 km / h ; 55 mph ) . It was intended to launch seaplanes , but was rarely used ; a 1931 report tallied only five launches of practice loads since the ship had been commissioned . It was removed during the ship 's 1936 refit . 
 Lexington was designed to carry 78 aircraft , including 36 bombers , but these numbers increased once the Navy adopted the practice of tying up spare aircraft in the unused spaces at the top of the hangar . In 1936 , her air group consisted of 18 Grumman F2F @-@ 1 and 18 Boeing F4B @-@ 4 fighters , plus an additional nine F2Fs in reserve . Offensive punch was provided by 20 Vought SBU Corsair dive bombers with 10 spare aircraft and 18 Great Lakes BG torpedo bombers with nine spares . Miscellaneous aircraft included two Grumman JF Duck amphibians , plus one in reserve , and three active and one spare Vought O2U Corsair observation aircraft . This amounted to 79 aircraft , plus 30 spares . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Lexington @-@ class carriers used turbo @-@ electric propulsion ; each of the four propeller shafts was driven by two 22 @,@ 500 @-@ shaft @-@ horsepower ( 16 @,@ 800 kW ) electric motors . They were powered by four General Electric turbo generators rated at 35 @,@ 200 kilowatts ( 47 @,@ 200 hp ) . Steam for the generators was provided by sixteen Yarrow boilers , each in its own individual compartment . Six 750 @-@ kilowatt ( 1 @,@ 010 hp ) electric generators were installed in the upper levels of the two main turbine compartments to provide power to meet the ship 's hotel load ( minimum electrical ) requirements . 
 The ship was designed to reach 33 @.@ 25 knots ( 61 @.@ 58 km / h ; 38 @.@ 26 mph ) , but Lexington achieved 34 @.@ 59 knots ( 64 @.@ 06 km / h ; 39 @.@ 81 mph ) from 202 @,@ 973 shp ( 151 @,@ 357 kW ) during sea trials in 1928 . She carried a maximum of 6 @,@ 688 long tons ( 6 @,@ 795 t ) of fuel oil , but only 5 @,@ 400 long tons ( 5 @,@ 500 t ) of that was usable , as the rest had to be retained as ballast in the port fuel tanks to offset the weight of the island and main guns . Designed for a range of 10 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 19 @,@ 000 km ; 12 @,@ 000 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) , the ship demonstrated a range of 9 @,@ 910 nmi ( 18 @,@ 350 km ; 11 @,@ 400 mi ) at a speed of 10 @.@ 7 knots ( 19 @.@ 8 km / h ; 12 @.@ 3 mph ) with 4 @,@ 540 long tons ( 4 @,@ 610 t ) of oil . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The Navy 's Bureau of Construction and Repair was not convinced when the class was being designed that aircraft could effectively substitute as armament for a warship , especially at night or in bad weather that would prevent air operations . Thus the carriers ' design included a substantial gun battery of eight 55 @-@ caliber Mk 9 eight @-@ inch guns in four twin gun turrets . These turrets were mounted above the flight deck on the starboard side , two before the superstructure , and two behind the funnel , numbered I to IV from bow to stern . In theory the guns could fire to both sides , but it is probable that if they were fired to port ( across the deck ) the blast would have damaged the flight deck . They could be depressed to − 5 ° and elevated to + 41 ° . 
 The ship 's heavy anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) armament consisted of twelve 25 @-@ caliber Mk 10 five @-@ inch guns which were mounted on single mounts , three each fitted on sponsons on each side of the bow and stern . No light AA guns were initially mounted on Lexington , but two sextuple .30 @-@ caliber ( 7 @.@ 62 mm ) machine gun mounts were installed in 1929 . They were unsuccessful and were replaced by two .50 @-@ caliber ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) machine guns by 1931 , one each on the roof of the superfiring eight @-@ inch turrets . During a refit in 1935 , platforms mounting four .50 @-@ caliber machine guns were installed on each corner of the ship , and an additional platform was installed that wrapped around the funnel . Six machine guns were mounted on each side of this last platform . In October 1940 , four 50 @-@ caliber Mk 10 three @-@ inch AA guns were installed in the corner platforms ; they replaced two of the .50 @-@ caliber machine guns which were remounted on the tops of the eight @-@ inch gun turrets . Another three @-@ inch gun was added on the roof of the deckhouse between the funnel and the island . These guns were just interim weapons until the quadruple 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch gun mount could be fielded , which occurred in August 1941 . 
 In March 1942 , Lexington 's eight @-@ inch turrets were removed at Pearl Harbor and replaced by seven quadruple 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch gun mounts . In addition 22 Oerlikon 20 mm cannon were installed , six in a new platform at the base of the funnel , 12 in the positions formerly occupied by the ship 's boats in the sides of the hull , two at the stern and a pair on the aft control top . When the ship was sunk in May 1942 , her armament consisted of 12 five @-@ inch , 12 quadruple 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch , 22 Oerlikons and at least two dozen .50 @-@ caliber machine guns . 
 = = = Fire control and electronics = = = 
 Each eight @-@ inch turret had a Mk 30 rangefinder at the rear of the turret for local control , but they were normally controlled by two Mk 18 fire @-@ control directors , one each on the fore and aft spotting tops . A 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) rangefinder was fitted on top of the pilothouse to provide range information for the directors . Each group of three five @-@ inch guns was controlled by a Mk 19 director , two of which were mounted on each side of the spotting tops . Lexington received a RCA CXAM @-@ 1 radar in June 1941 during a brief refit in Pearl Harbor . The antenna was mounted on the forward lip of the funnel with its control room directly below the aerial , replacing the secondary conning station formerly mounted there .

 The waterline belt of the Lexington @-@ class ships tapered 7 – 5 inches ( 178 – 127 mm ) in thickness from top to bottom and angled 11 ° outwards at the top . It covered the middle 530 feet ( 161 @.@ 5 m ) of the ships . Forward , the belt ended in a bulkhead that also tapered from seven to five inches in thickness . Aft , it terminated at a seven @-@ inch bulkhead . This belt had a height of 9 feet 4 inches ( 2 @.@ 8 m ) . The third deck over the ships ' machinery and magazine was armored with two layers of special treatment steel ( STS ) totaling 2 inches ( 51 mm ) in thickness . The steering gear , however , was protected by two layers of STS that totaled 3 inches ( 76 mm ) on the flat and 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) on the slope . 
 The gun turrets were protected only against splinters with .75 inches ( 19 mm ) of armor . The conning tower was 2 – 2 @.@ 25 inches ( 51 – 57 mm ) of STS , and it had a communications tube with two @-@ inch sides running from the conning tower down to the lower conning position on the third deck . The torpedo defense system of the Lexington @-@ class ships consisted of three to six medium steel protective bulkheads that ranged from .375 to .75 inches ( 10 to 19 mm ) in thickness . The spaces between them could be used as fuel tanks or left empty to absorb the detonation of a torpedo 's warhead .

 After fitting out and shakedown cruises , Lexington was transferred to the West Coast of the United States and arrived at San Pedro , California , part of Los Angeles , on 7 April 1928 . She was based there until 1940 and mainly stayed on the West Coast , although she did participate in several Fleet Problems ( training exercises ) in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea . These exercises tested the Navy 's evolving doctrine and tactics for the use of carriers . During Fleet Problem IX in January 1929 , Lexington and the Scouting Force failed to defend the Panama Canal against an aerial attack launched by her sister ship Saratoga . Future science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein reported aboard on 6 July as a newly minted ensign under Captain Frank Berrien . Heinlein experienced his first literary rejection when his short story about a case of espionage discovered at the Naval Academy failed to win a shipboard writing contest . 
 In 1929 , western Washington state suffered a drought which resulted in low levels in Lake Cushman that provided water for Cushman Dam No. 1 . The hydro @-@ electric power generated by this dam was the primary source for the city of Tacoma and the city requested help from the federal government once the water in the lake receded below the dam 's intakes during December . The U.S. Navy sent Lexington , which had been at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton , to Tacoma , and heavy electric lines were rigged into the city 's power system . The ship 's generators provided a total of 4 @,@ 520 @,@ 960 kilowatt hours from 17 December to 16 January 1930 until melting snow and rain brought the reservoirs up to the level needed to generate sufficient power for the city . Two months later , she participated in Fleet Problem X , which was conducted in the Caribbean . During the exercise , her aircraft were judged to have destroyed the flight decks and all the aircraft of the opposing carriers Saratoga and Langley . Fleet Problem XI was held the following month and Saratoga returned the favor , knocking out Lexington 's flight deck for 24 hours , just as the exercise came to a climax with a major surface engagement . 
 Captain Ernest J. King , who later rose to serve as the Chief of Naval Operations during World War II , assumed command on 20 June 1930 . Lexington was assigned , together with Saratoga , to defend the west coast of Panama against a hypothetical invader during Fleet Problem XII in February 1931 . While each carrier was able to inflict some damage on the invasion convoys , the enemy forces succeeded in making a landing . Shortly afterward , all three carriers transferred to the Caribbean to conduct further maneuvers . The most important of these was when Saratoga successfully defended the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal from an attack by Lexington . Rear Admiral Joseph M. Reeves baited a trap for King with a destroyer and scored a kill on Lexington on 22 March while the latter 's aircraft were still searching for Saratoga . 
 On 31 March 1931 , Lexington , which had been near Guantanamo Bay Naval Base , Cuba , was ordered to aid survivors of an earthquake that devastated Managua , Nicaragua . By the following day , the ship was close enough to launch aircraft carrying supplies and medical personnel to Managua . During Grand Joint Exercise No. 4 , Lexington and Saratoga were able to launch a massive airstrike against Pearl Harbor on Sunday , 7 February 1932 without being detected . The two carriers were separated for Fleet Problem XIII which followed shortly afterward . Lexington was assigned to Black Fleet , defending Hawaii and the West Coast against Blue Fleet and Saratoga . On 15 March , Lexington caught Saratoga with all of her planes still on deck and was ruled to have knocked out her flight deck and have badly damaged the carrier , which was subsequently ruled sunk during a night attack by Black Fleet destroyers shortly afterward . Lexington 's aircraft were judged to have badly damaged two of Blue Fleet 's battleships . 
 Before Fleet Problem XIV began in February 1933 , the Army and the Navy conducted a joint exercise simulating a carrier attack on Hawaii . Lexington and Saratoga successfully attacked Pearl Harbor at dawn on 31 January without being detected . During the actual fleet problem , the ship attempted to attack San Francisco , but was surprised in heavy fog by several defending battleships at close range and sunk . Fleet Problem XV returned to the Gulf of Panama and the Caribbean in April – May 1934 , but the participating ships of the Pacific Fleet remained in the Caribbean and off the East Coast for more training and maneuvers until they returned to their home bases in November . Most notably during Fleet Problem XVI , April – June 1935 , Lexington ran low on fuel after five days of high @-@ speed steaming and this led to experiments with underway replenishment that later proved essential to combat operations during the Pacific War . During Fleet Problem XVII in 1936 , Lexington and the smaller carrier Ranger routinely refueled their plane guard destroyers . 
 Admiral Claude C. Bloch limited Lexington to support of the battleships during Fleet Problem XVIII in 1937 and consequently the carrier was crippled and nearly sunk by surface gunfire and torpedoes . The following July , the ship participated in the unsuccessful search for Amelia Earhart . The 1938 Fleet Problem again tested the defenses of Hawaii and , again , aircraft from Lexington and her sister successfully attacked Pearl Harbor at dawn on 29 March . Later in the exercise , the two carriers successfully attacked San Francisco without being spotted by the defending fleet . Fleet Problem XX held in the Caribbean in March – April 1939 , was the only time before October 1943 that the Navy concentrated four carriers ( Lexington , Ranger , Yorktown , and Enterprise ) together for maneuvers . This exercise also saw the first attempts to refuel carriers and battleships at sea . During Fleet Problem XXI in 1940 , Lexington caught Yorktown by surprise and crippled her , although Yorktown 's aircraft managed to knock out Lexington 's flight deck . The fleet was ordered to remain in Hawaii after the conclusion of the exercise in May .

 Admiral Husband Kimmel , Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , Pacific Fleet , ordered Task Force ( TF ) 12 — Lexington , three heavy cruisers and five destroyers — to depart Pearl Harbor on 5 December 1941 to ferry 18 U.S. Marine Corps Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers of VMSB @-@ 231 to reinforce the base at Midway Island . At this time she embarked 65 of her own aircraft , including 17 Brewster F2A Buffalo fighters . On the morning of 7 December , the Task Force was about 500 nautical miles ( 930 km ; 580 mi ) southeast of Midway when it received news of the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor . Several hours later , Rear Admiral John H. Newton , commander of the Task Force , received orders that cancelled the ferry mission and ordered him to search for the Japanese ships while rendezvousing with Vice Admiral Wilson Brown 's ships 100 miles ( 160 km ) west of Niihau Island . Captain Frederick Sherman needed to maintain a continuous Combat Air Patrol ( CAP ) and recover the fuel @-@ starved fighters which were on patrol . With the Marine aircraft aboard , Lexington 's flight deck was very congested and he decided to reverse the phase of the ship 's electric propulsion motors and steam full speed astern in order to launch a new CAP and then swap back to resume forward motion to recover his current CAP . This unorthodox action allowed him to maintain a continuous CAP and recover his aircraft without the lengthy delay caused by moving the aircraft on the flight deck from the bow to the stern and back to make space available for launch and recovery operations . Lexington launched several scout planes to search for the Japanese that day and remained at sea between Johnston Island and Hawaii , reacting to several false alerts , until she returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 December . Kimmel had wanted to keep the ships at sea for longer , but difficulties refueling at sea on 11 and 12 December meant that the task force was low on fuel and was forced to return to port . 
 Re @-@ designated as Task Force 11 , and reinforced by four destroyers , Lexington and her consorts steamed from Pearl Harbor the next day to raid the Japanese base on Jaluit in the Marshall Islands to distract the Japanese from the Wake Island relief force led by Saratoga . For this operation , Lexington embarked 21 Buffalos , 32 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers , and 15 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers , although not all aircraft were operational . Vice Admiral William S. Pye , acting commander of the Pacific Fleet , canceled the attack on 20 December and ordered the Task Force northwest to cover the relief force . The Japanese , however , landed on Wake and forced it to surrender on 23 December before Saratoga and her consorts could get there . Pye , reluctant to risk any carriers against a Japanese force of unknown strength , ordered both task forces to return to Pearl . 
 Lexington arrived back at Pearl Harbor on 27 December , but was ordered back to sea two days later . She returned on 3 January , needing repairs to one of her main generators . It was repaired four days later when TF 11 sailed with the carrier as Brown 's flagship . The Task Force 's mission was to patrol in the direction of Johnston Atoll . It was spotted by the submarine I @-@ 18 on 9 January and several other submarines were vectored to intercept the Task Force . Another submarine was spotted on the surface the following morning about 60 nautical miles ( 110 km ; 69 mi ) south of the carrier by two Buffalos who reported it without alerting the submarine to their presence . That afternoon it was spotted again , further south , by a different pair of fighters , and two Devastators carrying depth charges were vectored to the submarine 's position . They claimed to have damaged it before it could fully submerge , but the incident is not mentioned in Japanese records . The putative victim was most likely I @-@ 19 , which arrived at Kwajalein Atoll on 15 January . Lexington and her consorts returned to Pearl Harbor on the following day without further incident . 
 Task Force 11 sailed from Pearl Harbor three days later to conduct patrols northeast of Christmas Island . On 21 January , Admiral Chester Nimitz , the new commander of the Pacific Fleet , ordered Brown to conduct a diversionary raid on Wake Island on 27 January after refueling from the only available tanker , the elderly and slow oiler Neches en route to Brown . The unescorted tanker was torpedoed and sunk by I @-@ 71 23 January , forcing the cancellation of the raid . The task force arrived back in Pearl two days later . Brown was ordered back to sea on 31 January to escort the fast oiler Neosho to its rendezvous with Halsey 's task force returning from its attack on Japanese bases in the Marshall Islands . He was then supposed to patrol near Canton Island to cover a convoy arriving there on 12 February . The task force was reconfigured with only two heavy cruisers and seven destroyers ; the eighteen Grumman F4F Wildcats of VF @-@ 3 , redeployed from the torpedoed Saratoga , replaced VF @-@ 2 to allow the latter unit to convert to the Wildcat . One of the Wildcats was severely damaged upon landing on the carrier . Nimitz cancelled the rendezvous on 2 February after it became apparent that Halsey did not need Neosho 's fuel and ordered Brown to proceed to Canton Island . On 6 February , Nimitz ordered him to rendezvous with the ANZAC Squadron in the Coral Sea to prevent Japanese advances that might interfere with the sea @-@ lanes connecting Australia and the United States . In addition , he was to protect a troop convoy bound for New Caledonia . 
 = = = = Attempted raid on Rabaul = = = = 
 The heavy cruiser San Francisco and two destroyers reinforced the task force on 10 February and Brown rendezvoused with the ANZAC Squadron six days later . Even after emptying Neosho of her oil there was not enough fuel for the ANZAC Squadron to join Brown 's proposed raid on Rabaul and they were forced to remain behind . Brown was reinforced by the heavy cruiser Pensacola and two destroyers on 17 February and tasked these ships to bombard Rabaul in addition to the attack by Lexington 's aircraft . While still some 453 nautical miles ( 839 km ; 521 mi ) northeast of Rabaul , the task force was spotted by a Kawanishi H6K " Mavis " flying boat on the morning of 20 February . The <unk> was detected by Lexington 's radar and was shot down by Lieutenant Commander Jimmy Thach and his wingman , but not before it radioed its spot report . Another H6K was vectored in to confirm the first aircraft 's report , but it was detected and shot down before it could radio its report . Brown 's plan had depended on the element of surprise and he canceled the raid , although he decided to proceed toward Rabaul to lure Japanese aircraft into attacking him . 
 Rear Admiral Eiji Gotō , commander of the 24th Air Flotilla , launched all 17 of his long @-@ range Mitsubishi <unk> " Betty " torpedo bombers , although no torpedoes were available at Rabaul and they made do with a pair of 250 @-@ kilogram ( 550 lb ) bombs apiece . To better search for the Americans , the Japanese split their aircraft into two groups and Lexington 's radar acquired one of these at 16 : 25 . At this time , the ship was rotating its CAP aircraft and the newly launched aircraft barely had time to reach the altitude of the Japanese before they arrived . Lexington had 15 fully fueled Wildcats and Dauntlesses on her forward flight deck that had been moved forward to allow the CAP fighters to land . They represented a serious fire hazard , but they could not be launched until all aircraft on the flight deck were moved aft . Cognizant of the danger , the deck crews succeeded in <unk> the aircraft and the fueled aircraft were able to take off before the Japanese attacked . Per Commander Herbert Duckworth , " It was as if some great hand moved all the planes aft simultaneously . " Only four of the nine G4Ms in the first wave survived to reach Lexington , but all of their bombs missed and they were all shot down afterward , including one by a Dauntless . The honors were not all one @-@ sided as they shot down two of the defending Wildcats . The second wave of eight bombers was spotted at 16 : 56 , while all but two of the Wildcats were dealing with the first wave . Lieutenant Edward O 'Hare and his wingman , Lieutenant ( junior grade ) Marion <unk> , were able to intercept the bombers a few miles short of Lexington , but <unk> 's guns jammed before he could fire a shot . O 'Hare was able to shoot down three G4Ms and damage two others before the bombers were able to drop their bombs , none of which struck the wildly maneuvering carrier . Only three of the G4Ms reached base as those Wildcats and Dauntlesses with enough fuel pursued and shot down several others . 
 = = = = Lae @-@ Salamaua raid = = = = 
 The task force changed course after dark for its rendezvous with the tanker Platte , scheduled for 22 February . One Japanese Aichi E13A " Jake " floatplane succeeded in tracking the task force for a short time after dark , but six H6Ks launched after midnight were unable to locate the American ships . Brown rendezvoused with Platte and the escorting ANZAC Squadron on schedule and he requested reinforcement by another carrier if another raid on Rabaul was desired . Nimitz promptly responded by ordering Yorktown 's Task Force 17 , under the command of Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher , to rendezvous with Brown north of New Caledonia on 6 March to allow the latter to attack Rabaul . The initial plan was to attack from the south in the hope of avoiding Japanese search aircraft , but this was changed on 8 March when word was received that Rabaul harbor was empty as the Japanese had invaded Papua New Guinea and all the shipping was anchored off the villages of Lae and Salamaua . The plan was changed to mount the attack from a position in the Gulf of Papua , even though this involved flying over the Owen Stanley Mountains . The two carriers reached their positions on the morning of 10 March and Lexington launched eight Wildcats , 31 Dauntlesses and 13 Devastators . They were the first to attack the 16 Japanese ships in the area and sank three transports and damaged several other ships before Yorktown 's aircraft arrived 15 minutes later . One Dauntless was shot down by anti @-@ aircraft fire while a Wildcat shot down a Nakajima E8N floatplane . A H6K spotted one carrier later that afternoon , but the weather had turned bad and the 24th Air Flotilla decided not to attack . Task Force 11 was ordered to return to Pearl and Lexington exchanged six Wildcats , five Dauntlesses and one Devastator for two Wildcats from Yorktown that needed overhaul before she left . The task force arrived at Pearl Harbor on 26 March . 
 The ship was given a short refit , during which her eight @-@ inch gun turrets were removed and replaced by quadruple 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 28 mm ) anti @-@ aircraft guns . Rear Admiral Aubrey Fitch assumed command of Task Force 11 on 1 April and it was reorganized to consist of Lexington and the heavy cruisers Minneapolis and New Orleans as well as seven destroyers . The task force sortied from Pearl Harbor on 15 April , carrying 14 Buffalos of VMF @-@ 211 to be flown off at Palmyra Atoll . After flying off the Marine fighters , the task force was ordered to train with the battleships of Task Force 1 in the vicinity of Palmyra and Christmas Island . Late on 18 April , the training was cancelled as Allied codebreakers had figured out that the Japanese intended to invade and occupy Port Moresby and Tulagi in the southeastern Solomon Islands ( Operation Mo ) . Therefore , Fitch 's ships , acting on a command from Nimitz , rendezvoused with TF 17 north of New Caledonia on 1 May , after refueling from the tanker Kaskaskia on 25 April to thwart the Japanese offensive . At this time , Lexington 's air group consisted of 21 Wildcats , 37 Dauntlesses and 12 Devastators .

 Both Task Forces needed to refuel , but TF 17 finished first and Fletcher took Yorktown and her consorts northward toward the Solomon Islands on 2 May . TF 11 was ordered to rendezvous with TF 17 and TF 44 , the old ANZAC Squadron , further west into the Coral Sea on 4 May . The Japanese opened Operation Mo by occupying Tulagi on 3 May . Alerted by Allied reconnaissance aircraft , Fletcher decided to attack Japanese shipping there the following day . The air strike on Tulagi confirmed that at least one American carrier was in the vicinity , but the Japanese had no idea of its location . They launched a number of reconnaissance aircraft the following day to search for the Americans , but without result . One H6K flying boat spotted Yorktown , but was shot down by one of Yorktown 's Wildcat fighters before she could radio a report . US Army Air Force ( USAAF ) aircraft spotted Shōhō southwest of Bougainville Island on 5 May , but she was too far north to be attacked by the American carriers , which were refueling . That day , Fletcher received Ultra intelligence that placed the three Japanese carriers known to be involved in Operation Mo near Bougainville Island , and predicted 10 May as the date of the invasion . It also predicted airstrikes by the Japanese carriers in support of the invasion several days before 10 May . Based on this information , Fletcher planned to complete refueling on 6 May and to move closer to the eastern tip of New Guinea to be in a position to locate and attack Japanese forces on 7 May . 
 Another H6K spotted the Americans during the morning of 6 May and successfully shadowed them until 1400 . The Japanese , however , were unwilling or unable to launch air strikes in poor weather or without updated spot reports . Both sides believed they knew where the other force was , and expected to fight the next day . The Japanese were the first to spot the Americans when one aircraft found the oiler Neosho escorted by the destroyer Sims at <unk> , south of the Strike Force . They were misidentified as a carrier and a cruiser so the fleet carriers Shōkaku and Zuikaku launched an airstrike forty minutes later that sank Sims and damaged Neosho badly enough that she had to be scuttled a few days later . The American carriers were west of the Japanese carriers , not south , and they were spotted by other Japanese aircraft shortly after the carriers had launched their attack on Neosho and Sims . 
 American reconnaissance aircraft reported two Japanese heavy cruisers northeast of Misima Island in the Louisiade Archipelago off the eastern tip of New Guinea at 07 : 35 and two carriers at 08 : 15 . An hour later Fletcher ordered an airstrike launched , believing that the two carriers reported were Shōkaku and Zuikaku . Lexington and Yorktown launched a total of 53 Dauntlesses and 22 Devastators escorted by 18 Wildcats . The 08 : 15 report turned out to be miscoded , as the pilot had intended to report two heavy cruisers , but USAAF aircraft had spotted Shōhō , her escorts and the invasion convoy in the meantime . As the latest spot report plotted only 30 nautical miles ( 56 km ; 35 mi ) away from the 08 : 15 report , the aircraft en route were diverted to this new target . 
 Shōhō and the rest of the Main Force were spotted by aircraft from Lexington at 10 : 40 . At this time , Shōhō 's CAP consisted of two Mitsubishi A5M " <unk> " and one Mitsubishi A6M Zero . The dive bombers of VS @-@ 2 began their attack at 1110 as the three Japanese fighters attacked the Dauntlesses in their dive . None of the dive bombers hit Shōhō , which was maneuvering to avoid their bombs ; one Dauntless was shot down by the Zero after it had pulled out of its dive ; several other Dauntlesses were also damaged . The carrier launched three more Zeros immediately after this attack to reinforce its CAP . The Dauntlesses of VB @-@ 2 began their attack at 11 : 18 and they hit Shōhō twice with 1 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 450 kg ) bombs . These penetrated the ship 's flight deck and burst inside her hangars , setting the fueled and armed aircraft there on fire . A minute later the Devastators of VT @-@ 2 began dropping their torpedoes from both sides of the ship . They hit Shōhō five times and the damage from the hits knocked out her steering and power . In addition , the hits flooded both the engine and boiler rooms . Yorktown 's aircraft finished the carrier off and she sank at 11 : 31 . After his attack , Lieutenant Commander Robert E. Dixon , commander of VS @-@ 2 , radioed his famous message to the American carriers : " Scratch one flat top ! " 
 After Shōkaku and Zuikaku had recovered the aircraft that had sunk Neosho and Sims , Rear Admiral Chūichi Hara , commander of the 5th Carrier Division , ordered that a further air strike be readied as the American carriers were believed to have been located . The two carriers launched a total of 12 Aichi D3A " Val " dive bombers and 15 Nakajima B5N " Kate " torpedo bombers late that afternoon . The Japanese had mistaken Task Force 44 for Lexington and Yorktown , which were much closer than anticipated , although they were along the same bearing . Lexington 's radar spotted one group of nine B5Ns at 17 : 47 and half the CAP was directed to intercept them while additional Wildcats were launched to reinforce the CAP . The intercepting fighters surprised the Japanese bombers and shot down five while losing one of their own . One section of the newly launched fighters spotted the remaining group of six B5Ns , shooting down two and badly damaging another bomber , although one Wildcat was lost to unknown causes . Another section spotted and shot down a single D3A . The surviving Japanese leaders cancelled the attack after such heavy losses and all aircraft jettisoned their bombs and torpedoes . They had still not spotted the American carriers and turned for their own ships , using radio direction finders to track the carrier 's homing beacon . The beacon broadcast on a frequency very close to that of the American ships and many of the Japanese aircraft confused the ships in the darkness . A number of them flew right beside the American ships , flashing signal lights in an effort to confirm their identity , but they were not initially recognized as Japanese because the remaining Wildcats were attempting to land aboard the carriers . Finally they were recognized and fired upon , by both the Wildcats and the anti @-@ aircraft guns of the task force , but they sustained no losses in the confused action . One Wildcat lost radio contact and could not find either of the American carriers ; the pilot was never found . Only 18 Japanese aircraft successfully returned to their carriers , beginning at 20 : 00 . 
 = = = = = 8 May = = = = = 
 On the morning of 8 May , both sides spotted each other about the same time and began launching their aircraft about 09 : 00 . The Japanese carriers launched a total of 18 Zeros , 33 D3As and 18 B5Ns . Yorktown was the first American carrier to launch her aircraft and Lexington began launching hers seven minutes later . These totaled 9 Wildcats , 15 Dauntlesses and 12 Devastators . Yorktown 's dive bombers disabled Shōkaku 's flight deck with two hits and Lexington 's aircraft were only able to further damage her with another bomb hit . None of the torpedo bombers from either carrier hit anything . The Japanese CAP was effective and shot down 3 Wildcats and 2 Dauntlesses for the loss of 2 Zeros . 
 The Japanese aircraft spotted the American carriers around 11 : 05 and the B5Ns attacked first because the D3As had to circle around to approach the carriers from upwind . The CAP shot down three of the torpedo bombers before they could drop their torpedoes , but 11 survived long enough to hit Lexington twice on the port side at 11 : 20 , although 2 of the B5Ns were shot down by anti @-@ aircraft fire after dropping their torpedoes . The shock from the first torpedo hit at the bow jammed both elevators in the up position and started small leaks in the port avgas storage tanks . The second torpedo hit her opposite the bridge , ruptured the primary port water main , and started flooding in three port fire rooms . The boilers there had to be shut down , which reduced her speed to a maximum of 24 @.@ 5 knots ( 45 @.@ 4 km / h ; 28 @.@ 2 mph ) , and the flooding gave her a 6 – 7 ° list to port . Shortly afterward , Lexington was attacked by 19 D3As . One was shot down by the CAP before it could drop its bomb and another was shot down by the carrier . She was hit by two bombs , the first of which detonated in the port forward five @-@ inch ready ammunition locker , killing the entire crew of one 5 @-@ inch AA gun and starting several fires . The second hit struck the funnel , doing little significant damage although fragments killed many of the crews of the .50 @-@ caliber machine guns positioned near there . The hit also jammed the ship 's siren in the " on " position . The remaining bombs detonated close alongside and some of their fragments pierced the hull , flooding two compartments . 
 Fuel was pumped from the port storage tanks to the starboard side to correct the list and Lexington began recovering damaged aircraft and those that were low on fuel at 11 : 39 . The Japanese had shot down three of Lexington 's Wildcats and five Dauntlesses , plus another Dauntless crashed on landing . At 12 : 43 , the ship launched five Wildcats to replace the CAP and prepared to launch another nine Dauntlesses . A massive explosion at 12 : 47 was triggered by sparks that ignited gasoline vapors from the cracked port avgas tanks . The explosion killed 25 crewmen and knocked out the main damage control station . The damage did not interfere with flight deck operations , although the refueling system was shut down . The fueled Dauntlesses were launched and six Wildcats that were low on fuel landed aboard . Aircraft from the morning 's air strike began landing at 13 : 22 and all surviving aircraft had landed by 14 : 14 . The final tally was three Wildcats shot down , plus one Wildcat , three Dauntlesses and one Devastator that were forced to ditch . 
 Another serious explosion occurred at 14 : 42 that started severe fires in the hangar and blew the forward elevator 12 inches ( 300 mm ) above the flight deck . Power to the forward half of the ship failed shortly afterward . Fletcher sent three destroyers to assist , but another major explosion at 15 : 25 knocked out water pressure in the hangar and forced the evacuation of the forward machinery spaces . The fire eventually forced the evacuation of all compartments below the waterline at 16 : 00 and Lexington eventually drifted to a halt . Evacuation of the wounded began shortly afterward and Sherman ordered " abandon ship " at 17 : 07 . A series of large explosions began around 18 : 00 that blew the aft elevator apart and threw aircraft into the air . Sherman waited until 18 : 30 to ensure that all of his crewmen were off the ship before leaving himself . Some 2 @,@ 770 officers and men were rescued by the rest of the task force . The destroyer Phelps was ordered to sink the ship and fired a total of five torpedoes between 19 : 15 and 19 : 52 . Immediately after the last torpedo hit , Lexington , down by the bow but nearly on an even keel finally sank at 15 ° 20 ′ S 155 ° 30 ′ E. Some 216 crewmen were killed and 2 @,@ 735 were evacuated .

 Lexington received two battle stars for her World War II service . She was officially struck from the naval register on 24 June 1942 . 
 In June 1942 , shortly after the Navy 's public acknowledgment of the sinking , workers at the Quincy shipyard , where the ship had been built twenty @-@ one years earlier , cabled Navy Secretary Frank Knox and proposed a change in the name of one of the new Essex @-@ class fleet carriers currently under construction there to Lexington ( from Cabot ) . Knox agreed to the proposal and the carrier was renamed as the fifth Lexington on 16 June 1942 . On 17 February 1943 , her successor was formally commissioned as USS Lexington ( CV @-@ 16 ) , which served as the flagship of Task Force 58 ( TF 58 ) during the Battle of the Philippine Sea and remained in service until 1991 .

 = Albert G. Mumma = 
 Albert G. Mumma ( 2 June 1906 – 15 July 1997 ) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy who played a pivotal role in the development of nuclear propulsion for warships . During World War II , he served in France and Germany with the Alsos Mission . 
 A 1926 graduate of the United States Naval Academy , Mumma served on a number of warships . He studied marine engineering at the L 'École Nationale Supérieure de Maritime in Paris , where he learned the latest techniques of maritime construction . During World War II he served at the David Taylor Model Basin , where he investigated problems of propeller design . In January 1943 , he took over the Propeller desk at the Bureau of Ships . He joined the Alsos Mission in 1944 , and in the last days of the war was part of a 75 @-@ man task force that captured the city of Kiel , including the whole garrison of 150 @,@ 000 men . 
 After the war he returned to the Bureau of Ships , where he was involved with the development of nuclear propulsion . Mumma was promoted to rear admiral in 1954 , and assumed command of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard . He became responsible for celebrating its 100th anniversary . However , his most important task was converting the shipyard over to the construction of nuclear submarines . In 1955 he became Chief of the Bureau of Ships , where he championed the adoption of the teardrop hull , and oversaw the design of nuclear submarines , cruisers and aircraft carriers . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Albert Girard Mumma was born in Findlay , Ohio on 2 June 1906 . His father was a U.S. Army officer , Morton C. Mumma , who had graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point with the class of 1900 . He would eventually retire with the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1928 , and be advanced to colonel on the retired list in 1930 . The family lived on a series of Army posts in the United States and overseas . After going on board the destroyer USS Barry in the Philippines when he was nine years old , Mumma decided to become a naval officer . He graduated from Iowa City High School in 1922 . 
 Albert entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis , Maryland in July 1922 with an appointment from Iowa Congressman Harry E. Hull . His two brothers also graduated from Annapolis . His older brother , Morton C. Mumma , Jr . , graduated with the class of 1925 , served with submarines and PT boats during World War II , and eventually rose to the rank of rear admiral . His younger brother George graduated with the class of 1934 , but resigned later that year , and later became a major in the Army during World War II . In addition , his nephew , Morton C. Mumma III , graduated with the class of 1948 , and joined the Air Force , from which he retired as a colonel in 1978 . 
 Mumma 's class at Annapolis was the first for which the traditional midshipmen 's cruises were replaced with aviator training for half the class , but Mumma was in the half that still went on the cruises . He sailed to Europe on the battleships USS Arkansas and USS Wyoming , and sailed from Annapolis to Bremerton , Washington , and back in the battleship USS New York . He undertook aviation training immediately after graduation . He graduated 18th out of 456 in the class of 1926 , and received an award for having the highest standing in engineering and aeronautics . He was commissioned as an ensign on graduation on 3 June 1926 , and after he finished his aviation training , he reported to the cruiser USS Richmond . This took him down to Guantanamo Bay , where he joined the crew of the cruiser USS Seattle . Returning to Iowa City for Thanksgiving , he had a blind date with Carmen Braley , whom he took to the Army @-@ Navy Game in Chicago . They became engaged in July 1925 , and were married on 1 October 1927 . They had three sons : Albert Girard Mumma , Jr . , John Stanton Mumma and David Braley Mumma . 
 His next assignment was to the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga , which was being fitted out . He was sent for flight training , but washed out due to having less than perfect eyesight . He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant ( junior grade ) on 3 June 1929 . After four years with Saratoga , he was assigned to the destroyer USS Waters as its gunnery officer . He left the Waters in 1932 to attend the Naval Postgraduate School , which was then located at Annapolis . In 1934 , he was offered an opportunity to complete his studies in Paris , although he had not studied French at the Academy . He enrolled in French at the University of Nancy in July . <unk> in the language , Mumma and his family spoke French only . He studied marine engineering at the L 'École Nationale Supérieure de Maritime in Paris . Instead of just becoming a maritime engineer , he learned the latest techniques of maritime construction . Before leaving Europe , he was informed that he had been selected for promotion to lieutenant , but he still had to pass the examinations . He reported to his next ship , which was the cruiser USS Chicago , as assistant engineer , at Long Beach , California , where he took his examinations , and was promoted on 29 June 1936 . After less than a year , he was sent to the new destroyer USS Clark on the request of its skipper , Commander Hewlett <unk> . 
 = = World War II = = 
 In 1939 , Mumma was posted to the David Taylor Model Basin , where he was promoted to lieutenant commander on 26 June 1940 and commander on 15 August 1942 . There he conducted research into the design of propellers and drive shafts . He examined a problem with the skegs on the keels of the North Carolina and South Dakota @-@ class battleships with harmonic vibrations , which was resolved with re @-@ designed propellers . Similar problems with " singing " propellers affected the Casablanca @-@ class escort carriers . In January 1943 , he took over the Propeller desk at the Bureau of Ships , with the rank of captain from 1 August 1943 . Propeller design was a critical part of all ships , and special propellers were designed and tested for PT boats and submarines . In early 1944 , he visited Britain to look at problems with vibration in the new Implacable @-@ class aircraft carriers . Once again , the solution lay in propeller design . 
 On returning to the United States , he met with Major General Leslie R. Groves , Jr . , the director of the Manhattan Project . Mumma became one of four naval officers assigned to the Alsos Mission , the others being Jacob Pieter Den Hartog , Wendell <unk> and Henry A. " <unk> " Schade . The naval section of Alsos would investigate German naval technologies , but the main objective of the Alsos Mission was to learn all it could about the German nuclear energy project . All members of the mission had ultra secret security clearances , but none had been involved with the development of the atomic bomb . 
 The naval section of Alsos flew into Paris soon after it had been liberated in August 1944 . They went down to Bordeaux to inspect the captured German destroyer <unk> . After the Alsos Mission became convinced that the Germans had not developed an atomic bomb , the naval section became the Naval Technical Mission Europe . They were particularly interested in the work of Dr Hellmuth Walter in the development of submarines and rockets . Most of the targets that they were interested in lay in the British sector , so they worked closely with their English allies . In the last days of the war , the Naval Technical Mission was part of a 75 @-@ man task force , most of whom were from 30 Assault Unit , that made a dash for Kiel , entering the city far in advance of the Allied advance . The whole garrison of the city , some 150 @,@ 000 men , surrendered to the task force . They drove to Admiral Karl Dönitz 's headquarters in Flensburg , where they saw but did not speak with him , as Dönitz was on his way to surrender . They spoke instead to Admiral Otto <unk> , and persuaded him to sign a release for German scientists , so men like Walter could freely discuss their work with the Allies . From April to December 1945 , Mumma also served as assistant naval attaché . 
 = = Post war = = 
 Mumma arrived back in the United States in December 1945 , and returned to the Bureau of Ships . The Bureau 's immediate post war priority was to develop nuclear propulsion for ships . With the Chief of the Bureau , Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills , and Captain Paul F. Lee , he went to see Groves and Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols , the commander of the Manhattan District , who were willing to help , but would not offer any fissionable material . The Navy decided to proceed with the design of a nuclear @-@ powered ship . They visited Oak Ridge , and attended lectures of nuclear physics from George Gamow and Lawrence R. <unk> . Mumma selected four outstanding young officers and a physicist , Everett Blizzard , to go to Oak Ridge and learn about reactor design . Mills decided that a senior officer should be sent as well , and added Hyman Rickover to the group , something that Mumma warned Mills that he would regret . 
 In 1949 , Mumma became Production Officer at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard . With the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 , the shipyard became very busy , as ships such as the Iowa @-@ class battleships were retrieved from being laid up , refurbished and recommissioned . In 1951 , he became commander of the David Taylor Model basin . He supervised the conversion of the submarine USS Albacore to incorporate a teardrop hull , and successfully pressed for a single screw design against entrenched prejudice . 
 Mumma was promoted to rear admiral in 1954 , and assumed command of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard . He became responsible for celebrating the 100th anniversary of its founding by David Farragut in 1854 . However , his most important task was converting the shipyard over to the construction of nuclear submarines . This involved extensive retraining of the shipyard 's personnel . His tour of command was a short one , for in 1955 he became Chief of the Bureau of Ships . Disappointed with the performance of the USS Nautilus and the Skate @-@ class submarines , he pushed for the adoption of the single screw and teardrop hull . The result was the Skipjack @-@ class submarine . The George Washington @-@ class submarines that followed were a development of the Skipjack with Polaris missiles . He also oversaw the design of the USS Enterprise , the first nuclear @-@ powered aircraft carrier , and its escorts USS Long Beach and USS Bainbridge . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Mumma retired from the Navy in 1959 and took a job as Vice President of Engineering at Worthington Corporation . He was elected to the board of directors in 1962 , and became Executive Vice President in 1964 , President in April 1967 , and Chairman of the Board in November 1967 . He retired at the age of 65 in July 1971 . That year President Richard Nixon appointed him to head the American Shipbuilding Commission , which was charged with reporting on ways of improving shipbuilding in the United States . In retirement , he held a number of directorships , on the boards of companies including Prudential Insurance , New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance , the First State Bank , United Hospitals of Newark , <unk> and Esser , C. R. Bard , the Newark Chamber of Commerce , and the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce . He was a member of the National Research Council , and served as President of the American Society of Naval Engineers and the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers , which awarded him its Admiral Jerry Land Gold Medal , and was a trustee of the Webb Institute of Naval Architecture , Drew University and Saint Barnabas Hospital . He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree by the Newark College of Engineering , and was created a Grand Officer of the Order of Orange @-@ Nassau by the Queen of the Netherlands . 
 He died in <unk> , Pennsylvania , on 15 July 1997 , and was interred at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery .

 " Dæmonicus " is the third episode of the ninth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files and the show 's 185th episode overall . It first premiered on the Fox network in the United States on December 2 , 2001 . The episode was written and directed by executive producer Frank Spotnitz . The episode is a " monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week " episode , a stand @-@ alone plot which is unconnected to the mythology , or overarching fictional history , of The X @-@ Files . The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5 @.@ 5 and its premiere was viewed by 5 @.@ 80 million households . The episode received mixed reviews from television critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files ; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) , Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) , and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) . In this episode , Doggett , Reyes , and Scully investigate a series of bizarre killings that seem to be due to demonic possession but which Doggett believes is a hoax . The agents soon meet Josef Kobold ( James Remar ) , a man who seems to be playing some sort of demonic game . 
 " Dæmonicus " was written by Spotnitz to develop the new settings for the show 's Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week episodes , as well as the series in general . One of the major steps taken was to move Scully from the X @-@ Files office to the FBI Academy at Quantico . When creating Josef Kobold , the episode 's antagonist , Spotnitz researched various crimes and criminals , until he learned about Caryl Chessman , a man who had been sentenced to death on a technical charge of kidnapping . Series co @-@ star Robert Patrick had issues remembering and delivering his lines , due to the theme of demonic possession , which reportedly made him uneasy . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Following a bizarre double @-@ murder with Satanic ritual overtones in Weston , West Virginia , John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) and Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) are offered the case . Doggett and Reyes ask Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) to do an autopsy on the murder victims . The agents comes to the conclusion that one of the murder victims was somehow tricked into killing his wife , while evidence at the scene points to two perpetrators . When Reyes claims to have felt the presence of evil , Doggett responds with great irritation . Dr. Monique Sampson calls them , saying that the murders may be connected to an escaped mental patient , Dr. Kenneth Richman , and a guard , Paul Gerlach . 
 Meanwhile , in a wooden area , the two perpetrators , both wearing demon masks , face each other some twenty paces apart . One of the perpetrators raises his gun and shoots the other . At the mental institution , the two agents interview Josef Kobold ( James Remar ) , the neighbouring patient of Richman . The answers Kobold gives are unsettling for the agents , as he says that one of the perpetrators has killed again , showing them the location and warning them of " something horrible " happening there . After the dead perpetrator 's body is recovered , Scully performs an autopsy and discovers that the body belongs to Gerlach . 
 The agents ask Kobold for help finding the remaining perpetrator . When speaking to Kobold , he suddenly speaks in a strange backward whispering and erupts in convulsions . Reyes hears the word " medicus , " meaning " physician . " After putting Kobold in the custody of another guard named Custer , Doggett and Reyes race to Sampson 's home and find her dead , with a dozen hypodermic needles jammed into her face . During a one @-@ on @-@ one confrontation , Kobold taunts Doggett about his personal life before vomiting all over him . As Doggett talks to Reyes , the power suddenly goes out in the mental institution . Custer approaches Kobold 's cell and witnesses him turning into a demon . 
 Doggett phones Scully to tell her that Kobold claims Richman is at an old marina near Annandale , Virginia . Scully drives there , but is attacked by Richman . When Doggett and Reyes arrive , they hear a gunshot from inside an abandoned warehouse . There , they find Richman dead . Scully explains that he was holding her at gunpoint until they arrived , then shot himself . After Scully 's lecture to FBI cadets , Doggett explains to her and Reyes that Kobold planned the entire ordeal as a game and got away with it .

 " Dæmonicus " was written and directed by executive producer Frank Spotnitz . The episode marked <unk> 's third credit as a writer and first credit as director for the season . In addition , the episode marked the second time Spotnitz helmed an episode 's directing , with the last being " Alone " . " <unk> " is the first Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week episode of season nine , meaning a stand @-@ alone episode unconnected to the series ' wider mythology ; as season nine was promoted as the " new " X @-@ Files , it was important to develop new settings for the show . One of these new settings was to move Dana Scully from the X @-@ Files office to the FBI Academy at Quantico . The scenes at the FBI Academy were shot at a lecture hall at UCLA . Spotnitz ’ s wife , Melissa , appears as one of the students in Scully ’ s class . 
 Spotnitz later called Kobold , the episode 's main antagonist , " the devil , in a cell . " When creating Kobold , Spotnitz researched various crimes and criminals , until he came across the name of Caryl Chessman , who had been sentenced to death on a technical charge of kidnapping . He was then able to connect the word " <unk> " to the idea that , for Kobold , his crimes were all a game . Spotnitz wanted the villain to be a character that " could help " , and not a character that would just tell the viewers " what The X @-@ Files was again " . 
 Series co @-@ star Robert Patrick had issues remembering and delivering his lines due to the theme of demonic possession , which reportedly " was freaking " him out . He later explained , " It was the first time that I couldn 't do my lines . Usually I would show up , and they 'd always put the camera on me first [ but this time ] I couldn 't do it . "

 The episode contained several sequences of Josef Kobold throwing up . Spotnitz had not intended the finished product to feature all the shots but the editor at that time , Chris Cooke , " cut it that way . " Spotnitz felt that it " was so completely over the top . " To create the shots , the production crew used tubes which supplied the faux vomit . The tubes were discreetly fitted to actor James Remar 's mouth . Remar , in turn , only had to open his mouth during the shooting of the sequence . Spotnitz later joked that he had " a thing for vomiting " .

 Initially , " I Hate Boys " was supposed to be produced by Le Tigre . Group member Johanna <unk> wrote about working with Aguilera on their official website : 
 " … While the giant sound of her stacked vocals and the pop sheen she lends to the tracks might seem at odds with Le Tigre 's aesthetic roots , it really works . The songs have a lot of elements we 're known for , like a garage guitar sound , schoolyard chants , new wave @-@ y synths , electro beats , and somehow it all sounds crazily right with Christina 's unbelievable voice . " 
 However , it was later revealed that the song was produced by Polow da Don and that Le Tigre only produced the song " My Girls " . Polow da Don talked about working with Aguilera in a Billboard interview , stating : " There 's two things you need to know about Christina Aguilera : The first is that , as far as her singing goes , she 's a professionally trained animal . And the other is that she knows exactly , absolutely what she wants . " 
 After " Not Myself Tonight " , the song was released as the second single of the album in Australia and New Zealand . A digital single was released on the iTunes Store on September 3 , 2010 .

" The Scotsman wrote that the song is an " electro glam " that " throwaway fun . " Allison Stewart from The Washington Post referred to it as a " tame , hand @-@ clappy pop song " and compared the track to Gwen Stefani 's songs . 
 TJ of Neon Limelight gave a mixed review , calling it " sassy " but " would work better for an artist at least a decade younger than Aguilera " , with its " painfully adolescent lyrics " . Becky Bain of Idolator wrote , " It 's one of those pandering songs that will no doubt have young girls singing along , particularly the chorus , but it 's a lazy one that leaves rubs us the wrong way . " Brad <unk> from MuuMuse named it a " filler , including the noisy , childish chant . " Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune commented that " it 's the kind of trite glitter @-@ disco might 've dispensed " , while comparing it to Spice Girls ' songs . Eric Henderson gave to the song a negative review , writing , " Considering ' I Hate Boys ' is closer than I ever thought Christina would ever come to recording a Daphne Aguilera track , it 's ironically also one of many tracks on Bionic that sound tailor @-@ made to accompany the opening credits of Johnny Weir 's forthcoming reality show .

Students at Oxford automatically continue their studies in Atlanta after successfully completing Oxford 's curriculum . 
 Emory College was built one mile north of Covington , Georgia by the Georgia Methodist Conference , after a failed attempt to establish a church @-@ sponsored manual labor school a few miles away . Following this , the Conference in 1836 granted Ignatius Alphonso Few a charter to open a new school . This school opened in 1838 and was named after John Emory , an influential Methodist bishop who had died before the school 's opening , and Oxford University , the alma mater of the founders of the Methodist movement . After the turn of the 20th century , Emory College received a generous monetary and land grant from Asa Griggs Candler , president of The Coca @-@ Cola Company , and moved its operations to Druid Hills , which is adjacent to Atlanta . During those years , Oxford spent time as a college preparatory school , junior college , four @-@ year college , and finally the two @-@ year Emory liberal arts program known today as Oxford College . 
 Oxford College has a total enrollment of 947 freshman and sophomore students from a wide variety of religious , ethnic , and geographic backgrounds , including 34 U.S. states , Puerto Rico , and 18 foreign countries . Campus organizations include various community service groups , interest clubs , and " social clubs " , the school 's replacement for traditional fraternities and sororities . Oxford participates in NJCAA Division III sports , with the men 's and women 's tennis teams winning national championships multiple times .

 = = = Founding and early history = = = 
 In 1833 , the Georgia Methodist Conference began considering establishing a church @-@ sponsored manual labor school where students would combine farm work with a college preparatory curriculum . At the Georgia Methodist Conference in 1834 , a preacher known as " Uncle Allen " Turner suggested that Georgia Methodists should develop their own school rather than support Randolph @-@ Macon College in Virginia . Heeding his advice , the Conference opened the Georgia Conference Manual Labor School in 1835 , but the institution immediately began facing financial challenges . As a result , the Conference granted Ignatius Few a charter to establish a new college named after John Emory , a Methodist bishop who was involved in the labor school 's founding but had died in a carriage accident before the school opened . In 1836 , the new school , Emory College , was established on a tract of land in Newton County one mile north of Covington , Georgia . This site was chosen because of its distance from the city , which the school 's founders feared would be a source of distraction for its students . The campus and the surrounding areas were planned and built in 1837 by Edward Lloyd Thomas , a Georgia land surveyor who also planned the city of Columbus , Georgia . On December 23 , 1839 , the state legislature incorporated the land around the school into a new city called Oxford . This name was selected because the founders of the Methodist movement , Charles Wesley and John Wesley , had previously attended Oxford University . Because the college and town were built together , many of the town 's early residents had contributed to the college 's founding and continued to be involved in its daily activities . 
 On September 17 , 1838 , two years after its chartering , President Ignatius Few and three faculty members welcomed fifteen freshmen and sophomores into its inaugural class . In order to raise money for maintaining the school , Few began selling lots around the college to local citizens . The founders envisaged a curriculum that would rest squarely on the classics and mathematics , with four years ' study of Greek , Latin , and mathematics , and three years ' study of the English Bible and the sciences of geography , astronomy , and chemistry . According to historian Henry M. Bullock , the founders intended Emory to be , " in the fullest sense of the term , a Christian college . " 
 = = = = Literary societies = = = = 
 Sometime in 1837 , a year before the inaugural class of students were officially enrolled , the new student body founded the Phi Gamma literary society on campus . The society adapted a motto : " Scientia et Religio <unk> <unk> " . In 1851 , Phi Gamma Hall was constructed and remains the oldest structure still standing on Oxford 's campus . A few years later , Phi Gamma decided it needed a rival society to compete with . Consequently , fourteen members withdrew from Phi Gamma to establish Few society , named after Ignatius Few . The facilities and libraries of each debate society were open to members of the rival society . The two halls oppose each other across the quad , and both buildings are variations of two @-@ story Greek Revival structures with temple form designs and columned porticos . Debate topics included the <unk> of war , women 's suffrage , the morality of slavery , and prohibition . 
 In 1850 , members of the two literary societies debated whether or not Georgia should secede from the union . A vote on the matter by members of both societies resolved for Georgia to remain in the union . However , when the American Civil War broke out , both debate societies temporarily suspended their activities as members left school to fight in the war . Both Phi Gamma and Few Halls were used as infirmaries for wounded soldiers . 
 = = = Civil War and Reconstruction = = = 
 Financial tension had reduced the college 's income and student body prior to the outbreak of war . So when war broke out in the summer of 1861 , the college 's administration made the decision to temporarily cease all academic operations . Emory College would remain closed to students for the duration of the fighting . During the war , college facilities were used by both Northern and Southern soldiers as military headquarters and infirmaries . Because of this , many deceased soldiers are buried near campus . The school 's library and other archives were damaged and later destroyed due to mishandling by military generals . It was not until the summer of 1866 that the campus was able to return to its academic functions , when it reopened with twenty students and three professors . Emory College continued to struggle with financial hardships after the war , and was only able to continue their operations with the aid of a state G.I. Bill . 
 In 1880 , the school 's fortunes reversed when College President Atticus G. Haygood delivered a Thanksgiving Day sermon expressing gratitude for the end of slavery and calling on the South to put the past behind them to " cultivate the growth of industry " . The speech captured the attention of George I. Seney , a Brooklyn banker and Methodist . Seney gave Emory College $ 5 @,@ 000 to repay its debts , $ 50 @,@ 000 for construction , and $ 75 @,@ 000 to establish a new endowment . Over the years , Seney invested more than a quarter @-@ million dollars into Emory College , helping to erect the Victorian Gothic @-@ style administrative building in the center of Oxford College that bears his name . The bell in the Seney Hall clocktower is the oldest permanent monument at Emory University today . Cast in 1796 , the bell was a gift from Alexander Means , the fourth President of Emory College , who in turn received it from Queen Victoria .

 By the turn of the 20th century , Emory College began producing several notable graduates . Alben W. Barkley , who graduated from Emory in 1900 , went on to represent Kentucky in both the United States House of Representatives and the Senate before becoming — at age 71 in 1949 — the oldest Vice @-@ President of the United States in history . Thomas M. Rivers became one of the nation 's premier virologists at the Johns Hopkins University Medical School , investigating encephalitis and smallpox and later leading the National Science Foundation 's quest for a polio vaccine . Dumas Malone went on to become the head of Harvard University Press , one of the nation 's leading academic publishers , and completed a Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning six @-@ volume study of Thomas Jefferson when he was past 90 years of age . 
 Wilbur A. Carlton , a student at Emory College in 1910 , described his experiences at the school at the time : 
 " At that time , half @-@ a century ago , Oxford was completely without pavement , plumbing in the homes , and electric lights except for the Williams Gymnasium and the Young J. Allen Memorial Church , which were furnished electricity by a dynamo in the boiler room of the gym . And of course , we obtained water from open wells for drinking as well as for all other purposes ... We had to do our studying by the light of a kerosene lamp . There were scarcely any automobiles and absolutely no co @-@ eds at that particular time although there had been a few previously . There was only one college dormitory , Marvin Hall , which was " outmoded " even for 1910 and which could accommodate only a small part of the student body ... Most of the students lived in boarding houses ( or private homes ) , of which there were several ... Such was our beloved Oxford in 1910 . " 
 Soon , the Georgia Methodist Conference began discussing transforming Emory College into a university , with Birmingham and Atlanta both bidding to host the proposed institution . Atlanta was eventually chosen as the home of the new Emory University after Asa Griggs Candler , president of the Coca @-@ Cola Company , deeded the university 65 acres of land six miles from the city 's downtown and contributed $ 1 million to the school 's endowment . Candler was originally reluctant to donate money to a project that he called " a crumbling castle " , but his brother , Warren Candler , convinced him otherwise . Asa Candler went on to serve as chair of the Emory University Board of Trustees and his brother later served as university president . 
 The Oxford campus continued to be used after the school 's move to Atlanta in 1915 . At first , the site was organized into the " Emory University Academy " , a preparatory school modeled after Phillips Academy and Phillips Exeter Academy in order to respond to the failure of the state 's public high schools . By 1921 , the academy had reached its peak enrollment of three hundred , doubling its previous enrollment record as a college . Due to financial concerns , including the loss of third @-@ party financial support , Emory University cut programs for all academic divisions at the academy , laid off faculty , and raised tuition . By the mid @-@ 1930s , with the introduction of college @-@ level curriculum , the University Academy was renamed " Emory Junior College at Oxford " and the site was reorganized into a two @-@ year junior college . In 1947 , influenced by the experimental models of integrating secondary and post @-@ secondary education at the University of Chicago , Emory and Oxford leaders reorganized the Oxford curriculum into the South 's first accredited four @-@ year junior college . The program combined an accelerated program for the last two years of high school with the first two years of college , but the program ended in 1963 after facing enrollment shortages . In response , Dean Virgil Eady recommended a name change to " Oxford College of Emory University " and advocated the position that Oxford is part of Emory University and not a " quasi @-@ independent college at Oxford " . The new college was then set up as a two @-@ year liberal arts program , similar in concept to the original Emory College model . 
 = = Campus = = 
 Oxford College is located on a 56 @-@ acre campus in Newton County , approximately 38 miles east of Emory 's Atlanta campus . It is located in the center of Oxford , a town located about half a mile north of Interstate 20 , and is directly bounded by Georgia State Route 81 ( signed as " Emory Street " ) to the east and the Fleming Woods to the west . Emory University 's bus routes provide service from Oxford to the Atlanta campus , <unk> Mall , and Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority stations . 
 Today , much of the college is organized around a pedestrian @-@ only quadrangle in the center and a few nearby streets . The campus ' western exits lead to the county @-@ owned Fleming Woods and hiking trails . Additionally , the college owns and operates an 11 @-@ acre organic farm located several blocks south of the campus . The land is utilized as both an educational environment for related courses and as a functioning farm that operates its own community @-@ supported agriculture and sells its produce at local farmers ' markets . In 1975 , the campus and many of its older buildings , such as Phi Gamma Hall and Seney Hall , and other surrounding structures were listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) as Oxford Historic District . 
 The majority of the school 's facilities are situated around the rectangular quadrangle in the center of campus , including two buildings that existed before the school was established : Phi Gamma Hall and a chapel . A nearly identical replica of Phi Gamma , Few Hall , sits opposite of Phi Gamma across the quad . These three buildings are all Greek Revival temple @-@ like structures with white columned porticos . In addition , a marble obelisk , erected in 1885 by the Grand Masonic Lodge of Georgia in memory of Ignatius Alphonso Few , sits in the center of the quad . Directly south of the monument is Seney Hall , a five @-@ story Victorian Gothic @-@ style building that is topped by a clock tower and bell that was given to the college by Queen Victoria in 1855 . At the end of every academic year , the bell is rung once in honor of each graduating student . Seney Hall is flanked to the west by Hopkins Hall and the Williams Gymnasium , and to the west by Language Hall , which was recently renovated and restored in 2013 . Further to the east sits Candler Hall , which was built in the Neoclassical architectural style and served as the school library until 1970 . Today it acts as a student center and houses a Barnes & Noble bookstore . 
 The other buildings that stand on the quad are Humanities Hall , the Jolley Residential Center , Oxford Science Building , <unk> Performance Arts Center ( which now adjoins Few Hall ) , Pierce Hall , and a library containing 85 @,@ 643 volumes . 
 = = Academics = = 
 Oxford College , as part of Emory 's undergraduate bachelor 's program , offers introductory and intermediate courses that contribute to undergraduate degrees in eighty @-@ five majors , the most popular being economics , psychology , biology , business administration , neuroscience and behavioral biology , and political science . All courses are on a credit hour system . Some classes are designated " theory @-@ practice service learning " courses , which integrate theory learning in the classroom with real @-@ world application . For example , students enrolled in the Sociology of Food course would dedicate certain hours a week working at the school 's organic farm . All students receive an associate of the arts degree upon completing Oxford 's curriculum , before continuing their studies in Atlanta .

 Oxford College has 56 faculty members in teaching positions , including Nitya Jacob , associate professor of biology who is one of fifteen international recipients of Science Magazine 's Inquiry @-@ Based @-@ Instruction Prize . Oxford College also has a visiting scholar agreement with Oxford University in England , where a faculty member from each school exchanges places for at least one week and deliver public lectures at their host 's location . Visiting professors in the past have included Jane Shaw and Tiffany Stern . 
 = = = Admissions = = = 
 Oxford College enrolled 947 students for the 2013 – 14 academic year , with an average class size of 21 students and a maximum class size of 50 students . 26 percent of the students enrolled are Asian / Pacific Islanders , 10 percent are African American , and 6 percent are Latino . Students who apply to Emory University may choose to begin study for four semesters at Oxford College before automatically continuing to the School of Arts and Sciences in Atlanta . Oxford graduates may also choose to apply for admission to the <unk> Business School or the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing . 
 There were 7 @,@ 425 applicants for the Oxford College class of 2016 , of whom 38 percent were ultimately accepted . Oxford College maintains the same application as Emory College on the Common Application , and applicants merely have to select one box or both regarding which school they wish to apply to . In addition to regular decision , students may choose to apply via the restrictive Early Decision option to either Emory College or Oxford College , or both , but not to another school . All applicants are able to participate in the Oxford Scholars program , the highest tier of which offers a full academic merit scholarship for four semesters at Oxford and four semesters at Emory . Admitted students had a 50th @-@ percentile range ( 25th to 75th percentile ) GPA of 3 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 92 and SAT scores ranging from 620 – 730 in critical reading , 630 @-@ 740 in writing , and 630 – 730 in mathematics . Enrolled students for the class of 2016 came from 355 high schools and 71 percent came from outside of the state of Georgia . 62 percent of undergraduates received an average financial aid package of $ 32 @,@ 901 and a total of 242 students received academic merit scholarships .

 = = = Residence Life = = = 
 All students are required to live on campus for the entire duration of their time at Oxford . The administration justifies this policy as an aspect of their mission to encourage students to interact with each other and build a strong community . Both freshmen and sophomores are housed in one of four residential halls scattered throughout campus : Haygood Hall , Jolley Residential Center , Fleming Hall , or <unk> and Murdy . These buildings range in occupancy size from 350 ( <unk> and Murdy ) to 106 ( Haygood ) . Originally constructed in 1913 , Haygood Hall is the oldest residential hall on campus , although it had to be rebuilt after a fire broke out in 1981 . All of the residence halls house study spaces , vending machines , kitchens , and laundry rooms . 
 Students have a choice of two dining options for their meals , depending on the time of day : a cafeteria dining hall and a late night grill . The dining hall offers takeout options for students with classes scheduled during lunch . Some of the food that are served at these two locations are sourced from the organic farm on campus . In terms of recreation , Williams Gymnasium houses an indoor hybrid basketball , volleyball , and badminton court , an indoor track , indoor pool , weight room , and aerobic studio . There are also ten tennis courts and a regulation soccer field on campus . In addition , the nearby Fleming Woods hiking trails are commonly utilized by Oxford students .

 = = = = Social clubs = = = = 
 Oxford is unique from many colleges in that it does not have traditional fraternities and sororities on campus . In their stead are " social clubs " , and instead of pledging , students " tap in " to these clubs . Historically , some of these social clubs , whose members meet regularly at social functions , were determined by geography , such as the Florida Club , South Georgia Club , and Alabama Club . Today , social clubs use the Greek alphabet system and mimic the functions of fraternities and sororities . 
 = = = = Student organizations = = = = 
 With the exception of the <unk> Senior Honor Society , which was founded in 1902 and remains active today , student clubs at Oxford historically did not function reliably for long periods of time because the two @-@ year structure of the school leads to high membership turnover . In order to counter this trend , the Leadership Oxford and <unk> programs were designed in 1988 to help students enhance their leadership skills . 
 As of 2012 , there are over 50 registered student organizations which cover a variety of interests , including student government , intramural sports , arts , media and publications , music , political / activist , ethnic / cultural , religion , and others . Many of Oxford 's student clubs participate in community service , including specifically volunteer @-@ oriented clubs such as Volunteer Oxford , Bonner Leader Program and Circle K. Consequently , 92 percent of Oxford students participated in community service in 2012 , contributing over 10 @,@ 000 hours in one academic year . Oxford College hours helped Emory University win the 2008 Presidential Award for General Community Service , an award given to higher education institutions for their commitment to community service , service @-@ learning and civic engagement . 
 = = = Traditions = = = 
 = = = = Dooley = = = = 
 Lord Dooley , also known as the " Lord of Misrule " and the " Spirit of Emory " , originated in Oxford and acts as Emory University 's unofficial mascot . Dooley , who borrows his first name and middle initial from the first and last name of the sitting president of Emory University , has two manifestations : one at Emory 's Atlanta campus , and one at Oxford . At both campuses , Dooley is represented by a student in a skeleton costume with a black cape , top hat , and white gloves , flanked on all sides by similarly dressed students acting as bodyguards . However , Oxford 's Dooley differs from his more modern and lively counterpart at the Atlanta campus . Because Oxford was his original home , Dooley 's appearances there try to symbolize his advanced age , with characteristics such as a crouched stance , slow walk , and his signature bent crane topped with a brown skull . Additionally , his habit of making public appearances at Oxford by emerging out of a coffin differ from the conventions of his counterpart in the Atlanta campus . 
 Dooley was first mentioned in an 1899 article that was printed in the school newspaper , Phoenix , titled " Reflections of a Skeleton " . The article was purportedly written by a skeleton in a science lab who complained of his dull and silent existence observing the comings and goings of the students . In 1901 , the Dooley mythology resurfaced , this time in a second editorial where he claims to have been the son of a wealthy Virginia planter who fought in the Revolutionary War and later died of alcohol abuse . In 1941 , Dooley began appearing physically on campus , starting the tradition known as " Dooley 's Week " , when he gets free rein to let students out of classes . Today , Dooley makes frequent appearances at social functions and other Oxford events , where he passes a message for a designated student to read to the student body . These messages relate to events on campus , ranging from critical rebukes of misdeeds to praise for individual student accomplishments . 
 = = = = Animals = = = = 
 Students at Oxford historically stole local farm animals and coaxed them into classrooms as pranks . In the 1930s to 1950s , students began bringing larger four @-@ legged farm animals to the upper floors of Seney Hall . The tradition culminated in 2008 when a group of unidentified students led a local zebra to the third floor of Seney and barricaded the windows , doors , and elevator . The zebra was nicknamed " Barcode " , and a stuffed zebra overlooks the quad in Seney Hall in memorial of the event . 
 = = Athletics = = 
 Although President Warren Candler was strongly against intercollegiate sports programs , he started Emory 's first intramural sports program in 1897 . During the rest of his term , students started intramural football , baseball , and gymnastic teams . However , for most of history , Emory did not have an athletic mascot . In 1960 , The Emory Wheel sports editor thought it was time to adopt a mascot , but the student body was not interested . Frustrated , he arbitrarily adopted the eagle as the mascot because " the name [ was ] simply applicable and [ had ] obvious decorative advantages . " Soon thereafter , Oxford followed and adopted the eagle as the mascot . 
 Today , Oxford 's athletic teams are members of the Georgia Junior College Athletic Association and the National Junior College Athletic Association . Oxford College sponsors men 's and women 's soccer , men 's basketball , men 's and women 's tennis , and men 's and women 's golf . The men 's tennis team won back @-@ to @-@ back NJCAA III National Championships in 2006 and 2007 and a third in 2009 , and the women 's tennis team won National Championships in 2011 . The women 's soccer team reached the national finals in 2006 .

 Oxford College and its facilities have served as sets for several movies and television shows . Notably , it is featured in the first episode of the television series The Dukes of Hazzard , when General Lee jumped 81 feet in front of Seney Hall . This scene remained in the opening credits for the rest of the series . This stunt was recreated by MTV for its series Your Movie Show in July 2005 on the release of The Dukes of Hazzard movie . In addition , the television show In the Heat of the Night also filmed some scenes on campus and in the town of Oxford . Scenes from the television show The Vampire Diaries were shot in the school 's library , quad , and theatre in 2009 , 2010 , and 2012 . Thereafter , the school served as the on @-@ location college set for the show 's fictional Whitmore College .

 " The Dundies " is the first episode of the second season of the American comedy television series The Office , and the show 's seventh episode overall . Written by Mindy Kaling and directed by Greg Daniels , who is also a producer for the show , the episode originally aired in the United States on September 20 , 2005 on NBC . 
 The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In the episode , Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) hosts " The Dundies " , the annual awards show in which he presents awards to various members of the office . But the night does not turn out as he plans , and Michael ends up angering or humiliating the majority of the office staff . Meanwhile , after Pam Beesly ( Jenna Fischer ) argues with her fiancé and becomes obviously intoxicated , she kisses Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) . 
 " The Dundies " was the second episode of the series directed by Greg Daniels . Many of the scenes at the Chili 's had to be changed so the restaurant would allow filming , most notably the scenes where Pam falls over . " The Dundies " was viewed by an estimated 9 @.@ 0 million viewers and received a 4 @.@ 3 / 10 % rating share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 , making it the highest episode of the series to air at that time , since the show 's pilot . The episode received positive reviews from critics .

 Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) is the only person who looks forward to " The Dundies " , his annual awards show at the local Chili 's restaurant . Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) tries to dissuade Michael from once again awarding Pam Beesly ( Jenna Fischer ) the " World 's Longest Engagement " award . Meanwhile , Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) learns that there is graffiti about Michael on the ladies ' room wall , and his attempts to investigate are embarrassingly unsuccessful . 
 At the awards show , Michael 's performance as MC falls flat . Ryan Howard ( B.J. Novak ) is embarrassed when Michael awards him " Hottest in the Office " . Pam 's fiancé Roy Anderson ( David Denman ) and Darryl Philbin ( Craig Robinson ) leave , taking Pam with them . In the parking lot , Roy and Pam argue , and Pam returns alone to the restaurant , where she begins drinking beer and margaritas . <unk> by other customers , Michael decides to end the show , but an intoxicated Pam leads the office in encouraging him to continue . Relieved upon winning the Dundie for " <unk> Sneakers " , Pam gives a drunken acceptance speech and kisses Jim on the lips . This leaves Jim surprised , but happy . 
 As Jim recaps the Dundies for the camera , Pam stares at Jim with dazed fascination and then falls off her stool , and Dwight springs to her rescue , thinking Pam is having a seizure . He then tries to take off his dress shirt and tie , but a Chili 's employee stops him . After the party is over , Pam runs to the camera and screams " I would just like to say that this was the best Dundies ever ! Whoo ! " . In the parking lot , Pam admits to Jim that it was she who wrote the graffiti . She begins to ask Jim a question , but stops when she notices the camera . A Chili 's employee then talks to the camera and says that Pam apparently was sneaking drinks off of others ' tables , which is against the restaurant 's rules . He then tells the audience that he <unk> her driver 's license and she is never welcome at Chili 's again . Jim helps Pam into Angela Martin 's ( Angela Kinsey ) car and smiles as they leave .

 " The Dundies " was the second episode of the series directed by Greg Daniels . Daniels had previously directed the first season episode " Basketball " . " The Dundies " was written by Mindy Kaling , who also acts for the show as customer service representative Kelly Kapoor . According to Daniels , while he worked on the Fox animated series King of the Hill , the show would have an annual Dundies @-@ type event called the " Swampy Awards " . He previously considered using the plot from this episode for the pilot , but decided it was a " very risky thing to do " and decided to make the pilot a direct adaption of the first episode of the British version . Following the mixed reaction towards the first season , the writers attempted to make the series more " optimistic " and make Michael more likable . They also established the supporting characters of the series more , giving them actual personalities , and the producers also made the lights to the office brighter , which allowed the series to differentiate itself from the British version . 
 The episode was filmed at a former Chili 's in the San Fernando Valley , in the city of Burbank . The episode was filmed " from dawn , until very late at night " , according to Kaling . During filming breaks , Kaling later joked that she took " ladylike " naps , while Paul Lieberstein made notes on the episode and its script . While filming , many parts of the script were changed so the restaurant would allow the shoot to continue . For instance , in the original script , Pam vomits at Chili 's and Dwight responds , " A woman has vomited ! " Because the completed script was not available for Chili 's to review until shooting had already started , when they were finally given a chance to read it , they objected to a customer vomiting in their restaurant . Chili 's withdrew its permission to shoot , but , after a few hours , Steve Carell developed a compromise : Pam would fall off her bar stool and Dwight would respond , " A woman has had a seizure ! " In original version , Pam was also to be over @-@ served alcohol by the Chili 's staff , but Chili 's — feeling that this would reflect poorly on their character as a company — did not want this in the episode either . To solve this issue , the writers had Pam steal drinks off other tables . The writers and producers also agreed to include a scene in which the actual owner of the Chili 's restaurant ( Jon <unk> , not an actor ) makes it clear that the restaurant does not over @-@ serve alcohol to its customers . Since Jenna Fischer does not drink much in real life , B. J. Novak took her out so she could get drunk while Novak described to her how she was behaving and how it did not match her own perception . She drew upon this experience for her performance .

 Michael calls Jim " Fat Halpert " , using a voice reminiscent of the cartoon character Fat Albert . During the " Last Year 's Dundies " video , Michael awards Oscar the " Show Me the Money " award , a reference to the 1996 movie Jerry Maguire . Dwight later plays a recorder version of Lou Bega 's 1999 cover of " Mambo No. 5 " while Michael sings parody lyrics . During a phone call , Jan makes reference to a " tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money . " Michael defends his actions , noting that it was a " fun @-@ raiser " , in an attempt to raise the morale of the people in the office following the events of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami . Michael 's psychic act is a blatant rip @-@ off of Johnny Carson 's Carnac the Magnificent act . 
 At the Dundies party Michael sings various song parodies , including spoofs of Naughty by Nature 's 1991 hit " <unk> " , Elton John 's 1971 hit " Tiny Dancer " , and Hot Chocolate 's 1975 single " You Sexy Thing " during the " Hottest in the Office " award . Originally , a parody of Eminem 's 2002 hit " Lose Yourself " was slated to be featured in the episode , but was axed when Eminem refused to allow permission . In the background of one scene , Michael is seen singing the 1987 song " ( I 've Had ) The Time of My Life " , by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes . The final scene in the episode features " Tiny Dancer " playing over the actual footage of the show .

The episode was seen by 9 @.@ 0 million viewers , making it the highest @-@ rated episode of the series at the time , sans the show 's pilot episode . 
 " The Dundies " represented a turning point in the series , in which the show found its own tone and differentiated itself from the British version . It received critical acclaim unlike the first season . In its " The Top 10 Moments from The Office " , IGN ranked Pam 's drunken scene at Chili 's as number five . Michael Sciannamea of TV Squad stated that " This season 's first episode showed a marked improvement over the final episode from last season " , and went on to praise the episode 's expansion of supporting characters as one of the main reasons for the improvement . In a Flashback review , Travis Fickett of IGN complimented the episode for creating the personalities of the supporting characters and for the workers affection towards Michael in the episode . He also praised the Jim and Pam moments in the episode . He ultimately gave the episode a 9 @.@ 0 / 10 . Seb Patrick of Noise to Signal , while comparing the American version of The Office favorably to its UK counterpart , writes that the series " could be finding its feet again over the course of its opening couple of episodes . " 
 Jacob Clifton from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A rating . Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " B " , citing the scene wherein Pam and Jim both convince Michael to continue on with the Dundies celebration , noting that " they ’ re clapping and chanting for Michael Scott , human being , and that ’ s incredibly important for the episodes that will follow " . However , he felt that the episode 's reputation was slightly inflated by its success , and that the episode , while good , is merely just a start for the success that would follow it . 
 = Tipu 's Tiger = 
 Tipu 's Tiger or Tippu 's Tiger is an eighteenth @-@ century automaton or mechanical toy created for Tipu Sultan , the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore in India . The carved and painted wood casing represents a tiger savaging a near life @-@ size European man . Mechanisms inside the tiger and man 's bodies make one hand of the man move , emit a wailing sound from his mouth and grunts from the tiger . In addition a flap on the side of the tiger folds down to reveal the keyboard of a small pipe organ with 18 notes . 
 The tiger was created for Tipu and makes use of his personal emblem of the tiger and expresses his hatred of his enemy , the British of the East India Company . The tiger was discovered in his summer palace after East India Company troops stormed Tipu 's capital in 1799 . The Governor General , Lord Mornington sent the tiger to Britain initially intending it to be an exhibit in the Tower of London . First exhibited to the London public in 1808 in East India House , then the offices of the East India Company in London , it was later transferred to the Victoria and Albert Museum ( V & A ) in 1880 ( accession number <unk> ( IS ) ) . It now forms part of the permanent exhibit on the " Imperial courts of South India " . From the moment it arrived in London to the present day , Tipu 's Tiger has been a popular attraction to the public . 
 = = Background = = 
 Tipu 's Tiger was originally made for Tipu Sultan ( also referred to as Tippoo Saib , Tippoo Sultan and other epithets in nineteenth @-@ century literature ) in the Kingdom of Mysore ( today in the Indian state of Karnataka ) around 1795 . Tipu Sultan used the tiger systematically as his emblem , employing tiger motifs on his weapons , on the uniforms of his soldiers , and on the decoration of his palaces . His throne rested upon a probably similar life @-@ size wooden tiger , covered in gold ; like other valuable treasures it was broken up for the highly organised prize fund shared out between the British army . 
 Tipu had inherited power from his father Hyder Ali , a Muslim soldier who had risen to become <unk> or commander @-@ in @-@ chief under the ruling Hindu Wodeyar dynasty , but from 1760 was in effect the ruler of the kingdom . Hyder , after initially trying to ally with the British against the Marathas , had later become their firm enemy , as they represented the most effective obstacle to his expansion of his kingdom , and Tipu grew up with violently anti @-@ British feelings . 
 The tiger formed part of a specific group of large caricature images commissioned by Tipu showing European , often specifically British , figures being attacked by tigers or elephants , or being executed , tortured and humiliated and attacked in other ways . Many of these were painted by Tipu 's orders on the external walls of houses in the main streets of Tipu 's capital , Seringapatam . Tipu was in " close co @-@ operation " with the French , who were at war with Britain and still had a presence in South India , and some of the French craftsmen who visited Tipu 's court probably contributed to the internal works of the tiger . 
 The design may have been inspired by the death in 1792 of Hugh Munro , son of General Sir Hector Munro , who had commanded a division during Sir Eyre Coote 's victory at the Battle of Porto Novo ( <unk> ) in 1781 when Hyder Ali , Tipu Sultan 's father , was defeated with a loss of 10 @,@ 000 men during the Second Anglo @-@ Mysore War . Hugh Munro , a civilian visiting India , was attacked and killed by a tiger on 22 December 1792 while hunting with several companions on <unk> Island in the Bay of Bengal ( still one of the last refuges of the Bengal tiger ) .

 Tipu 's Tiger is notable as an example of early musical automata from India , and also for the fact that it was especially constructed for Tipu Sultan . 
 With overall dimensions for the object of 71 @.@ 2 centimetres ( 28 @.@ 0 in ) high and 172 centimetres ( 68 in ) long , the man at least is close to life @-@ size . The painted wooden shell forming both figures likely draws upon South Indian traditions of Hindu religious sculpture . It is typically about half an inch thick , and now much reinforced on the inside following bomb damage in World War II . There are many openings at the head end , formed to match the pattern of the inner part of the painted tiger stripes , which allow the sounds from the pipes within to be heard better , and the tiger is " obviously male " . The top part of the tiger 's body can be lifted off to inspect the mechanics by removing four screws . The construction of the human figure is similar but the wood is much thicker . Examination and analysis by the V & A conservation department has determined that much of the current paint has been restored or overpainted . 
 The human figure is clearly in European costume , but authorities differ as to whether it represents a soldier or civilian ; the current text on the V & A website avoids specifying , other than describing the figure as " European " . 
 The operation of a crank handle powers several different mechanisms inside Tipu 's Tiger . A set of bellows expels air through a pipe inside the man 's throat , with its opening at his mouth . This produces a wailing sound , simulating the cries of distress of the victim . A mechanical link causes the man 's left arm to rise and fall . This action alters the pitch of the ' wail pipe ' . Another mechanism inside the tiger 's head expels air through a single pipe with two tones . This produces a " regular grunting sound " simulating the roar of the tiger . Concealed behind a flap in the tiger 's flank is the small ivory keyboard of a two @-@ stop pipe organ in the tiger 's body , allowing tunes to be played . 
 The style of both shell and workings , and analysis of the metal content of the original brass pipes of the organ ( many have been replaced ) , indicates that the tiger was of local manufacture . The presence of French artisans and French army engineers within Tipu 's court has led many historians to suggest there was French input into the mechanism of this automaton . 
 = = History = = 
 Tipu 's Tiger was part of the extensive plunder from Tipu 's palace captured in the fall of Seringapatam , in which Tipu died , on 4 May 1799 , at the culmination of the Fourth Anglo @-@ Mysore War . An aide @-@ de @-@ camp to the Governor General of the East India Company , Richard Wellesley , 1st Marquess Wellesley , wrote a memorandum describing the discovery of the object : 
 " In a room appropriated for musical instruments was found an article which merits particular notice , as another proof of the deep hate , and extreme loathing of Tippoo Saib towards the English . This piece of mechanism represents a royal Tyger in the act of devouring a prostrate European . There are some barrels in imitation of an Organ , within the body of the Tyger . The sounds produced by the Organ are intended to resemble the cries of a person in distress intermixed with the roar of a Tyger . The machinery is so contrived that while the Organ is playing , the hand of the European is often lifted up , to express his helpless and deplorable condition . The whole of this design was executed by Order of Tippoo Sultaun . It is imagined that this memorial of the arrogance and barbarous cruelty of Tippoo Sultan may be thought deserving of a place in the Tower of London . " 
 The earliest published drawing of Tippoo 's Tyger was the frontispiece for the book " A Review of the Origin , Progress and Result , of the Late Decisive War in Mysore with Notes " by James Salmond , published in London in 1800 . It preceded the move of the exhibit from India to England and had a separate preface titled " Description of the <unk> " which said : 
 " This drawing is taken from a piece of mechanism representing a royal tyger in the act of devouring a prostrate European . There are some barrels in imitation of an organ within the body of the tyger , and a row of keys of natural notes . The sounds produced by the organ are intended to resemble the cries of a person in distress , intermixed with the roar of a tyger . The machinery is so contrived , that while the organ is playing , the hand of the European is often lifted up to express his helpless and deplorable condition . 
 The whole of this design is as large as life , and was executed by order of Tippoo Sultaun , who frequently amused himself with a sight of this emblematic triumph of the <unk> , over the English , Sircar . The piece of machinery was found in a room of the palace at Seringapatam appropriated for the reception of musical instruments , and hence called the Rag <unk> . 
 The original wooden figure from which the drawing is taken will be forwarded , by the ships of this season , to the Chairman of the Court of Directors , to be presented to his Majesty . It is imagined that this characteristic emblem of the ferocious animosity of Tippoo Sultaun against the British Nation may not be thought undeserving of a place in the Tower of London . " 
 Unlike Tipu 's throne , which also featured a large tiger , and many other treasures in the palace , the materials of Tipu 's Tiger had no intrinsic value , which together with its striking iconography is what preserved it and brought it back to England essentially intact . The Governors of the East India Company had at first intended to present the tiger to the Crown , with a view to it being displayed in the Tower of London , but then decided but to keep it for the Company . After some time in store , during which period the first of many " misguided and wholly unjustified endeavours at " improving " the piece " from a musical point of view may have taken place , it was displayed in the reading @-@ room of the East India Company Museum and Library at East India House in Leadenhall Street , London from July 1808 . 
 It rapidly became a very popular exhibit , and the crank @-@ handle controlling the wailing and grunting could apparently be freely turned by the public . The French author Gustave Flaubert visited London in 1851 to see the Great Exhibition , writes Julian Barnes , but finding nothing of interest in The Crystal Palace , visited the East India Company Museum where he was greatly enamoured by Tipu 's Tiger . By 1843 it was reported that " The machine or organ ... is getting much out of repair , and does not altogether realize the expectation of the visitor " . Eventually the crank @-@ handle disappeared , to the great relief of students using the reading @-@ room in which the tiger was displayed , and The Athenaeum later reported that 
 " These shrieks and growls were the constant plague of the student busy at work in the Library of the old India House , when the Leadenhall Street public , unremittingly , it appears , were bent on keeping up the performances of this barbarous machine . Luckily , a kind fate has deprived him of his handle , and stopped up , we are happy to think , some of his internal organs ... and we do sincerely hope he will remain so , to be seen and admired , if necessary , but to be heard no more " . 
 When the East India Company was taken over by the Crown in 1858 , the tiger was stored in Fife House , Whitehall until 1868 , when it moved down the road to the new India Office , which occupied part of the building still used by today 's Foreign and Commonwealth Office . In 1874 it was moved to the India Museum in South Kensington , which was in 1879 dissolved , with the collection distributed between other museums ; the V & A records the tiger as acquired in 1880 . During World War II the tiger was badly damaged by a German bomb which brought down the roof above it , breaking the wooden casing into several hundred pieces , which were carefully pieced together after the war , so that by 1947 it was back on display . In 1955 it was exhibited in New York at the Museum of Modern Art through the summer and spring . 
 In recent times , Tipu 's Tiger has formed an essential part of museum exhibitions exploring the historical interface between Eastern and Western civilisation , colonialism , ethnic histories and other subjects , one such being held at the Victoria and Albert Museum itself in autumn 2004 titled " Encounters : the meeting of Asia and Europe , 1500 – 1800 " . In 1995 , ' The Tiger and the Thistle ' bi @-@ centennial exhibition was held in Scotland on the topic of " Tipu Sultan and the Scots " . The organ was considered too fragile to travel to Scotland for the exhibition . Instead , a full @-@ sized replica made of fibre glass and painted by Derek Freeborn , was exhibited in its place . The replica itself also had an earlier Scottish association , having been made in 1986 for ' The Enterprising Scot ' exhibition , which was held to commemorate the October 1985 merger of the Royal Scottish Museum and the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland to form a new entity - the National Museum of Scotland . 
 Today Tipu 's Tiger is arguably the best @-@ known single work in the Victoria and Albert Museum as far as the general public is concerned . It is a " must @-@ see " highlight for school @-@ children 's visits to the Victoria and Albert Museum , and functions as an iconic representation of the museum , replicated in various forms of memorabilia in the museum shops including postcards , model kits and stuffed toys . Visitors can no longer operate the mechanism since the device is now kept in a glass case . 
 A small model of this toy is exhibited in Tipu Sultan 's wooden palace in Bangalore . Although other items associated with Tipu , including his sword , have recently been purchased and brought back to India by billionaire Vijay Mallya , Tipu 's Tiger has not itself been the subject of an official repatriation request , presumably due to the ambiguity underlying Tipu 's image in the eyes of Indians ; his being an object of loathing in the eyes of some Indians while considered a hero by others . 
 = = Symbolism = = 
 Tipu Sultan identified himself with tigers ; his personal epithet was ' The Tiger of Mysore , ' his soldiers were dressed in ' tyger ' jackets , his personal symbol invoked a tiger 's face through clever use of calligraphy and the tiger motif is visible on his throne , and other objects in his personal possession , including Tipu 's Tiger . Accordingly , as per Joseph <unk> , for Tipu the tiger striking down the European in the organ represented his symbolic triumph over the British . 
 The British hunted tigers , not just to emulate the Mughals and other local elites in this " royal " sport , but also as a symbolic defeat of Tipu Sultan and any other ruler who stood in the path of British domination . The tiger motif was used in the " Seringapatam medal " which was awarded to those who participated in the 1799 campaign , where the British lion was depicted as overcoming a prostrate tiger , the tiger being the dynastic symbol of Tipu 's line . The Seringapatam medal was issued in gold for the highest dignitaries who were associated with the campaign as well as select officers on general duty , silver for other dignitaries , field officers and other staff officers , in copper @-@ bronze for the non @-@ commissioned officers and in tin for the privates . On the reverse it had a frieze of the storming of the fort while the obverse showed , in the words of a nineteenth @-@ century tome on medals , " the <unk> LION subduing the TIGER , the emblem of the late Tippoo Sultan 's government , with the period when it was effected and the following words ' <unk> <unk> @-@ UL <unk> ' , signifying the Lion of God is the conqueror , or the conquering Lion of God . " 
 In this manner , the iconography of this automaton was adopted and overturned by the British . When Tipu 's Tiger was displayed in London in the nineteenth century , British viewers of the time " characterised the tiger as a trophy and symbolic justification of British colonial rule " . Tipu 's Tiger along with other trophies such as Tipu 's sword , the throne of Ranjit Singh , Tantya Tope 's kurta and Nana Saheb 's betel @-@ box which was made of brass , were all displayed as " memorabilia of the Mutiny " . 
 In one interpretation , the display of Tipu 's Tiger in South Kensington , served to remind the visitor of the noblesse oblige of the British Empire to bring civilisation to the barbaric lands of which Tipu was king . 
 Tipu 's Tiger is also notable as a literal image of a tiger killing a European , an important symbol in England at the time , and from about 1820 the " Death of Munro " became one of the scenes in the repertoire of Staffordshire pottery figurines . Tiger @-@ hunting in the British Raj , is also considered to represent not just the political subjugation of India , but in addition , the triumph over India 's environment . The iconography persisted and during the rebellion of 1857 , Punch ran a political cartoon showing the Indian rebels as a tiger , attacking a victim in an identical pose to Tipu 's Tiger , being defeated by the British forces shown by the larger figure of a lion . 
 Motives for collection of articles , such as Tipu 's Tiger , are seen by literary historian Barrett Kalter as having a social and cultural context . The collection of Western and Indian art by Tipu Sultan is seen by Kalter as motivated by the need to display his wealth and legitimise his authority over his subjects who were predominantly Hindu and did not share his religion , viz . Islam . In the case of the East India Company , collection of documents , artefacts and objet 's d 'art from India helped develop the idea of a subjugated Indian populace in the minds of the British people , the thought being that the possession of such objects of a culture represented understanding of , dominance over , and mastery of that culture . 
 = = As a musical instrument = = 
 In a detailed study published in 1987 of the tiger 's musical and noise @-@ making functions , Arthur <unk> Ord @-@ Hume concluded that since coming to Britain , " the instrument has been ruthlessly reworked , and in doing so much of its original operating principles have been destroyed " . There are two ranks of pipes in the organ ( as opposed to the wailing and grunting functions ) , each " comprising eighteen notes , [ which ] are nominally of <unk> pitch and are unisons - i.e. corresponding pipes in each register make sounds of the same musical pitch . This is an unusual layout for a pipe organ although while selecting the two stops together results in more sound ... there is also detectable a slight beat between the pipes so creating a celeste effect . ... it is considered likely that as so much work has been done ... this characteristic may be more an accident of tuning than an intentional feature " . The tiger 's grunt is made by a single pipe in the tiger 's head and the man 's wail by a single pipe emerging at his mouth and connected to separate bellows located in the man 's chest , where they can be accessed by <unk> and lifting off the tiger . The grunt operates by cogs gradually raising the weighted " grunt @-@ pipe " until it reaches a point where it slips down " to fall against its fixed lower @-@ board or reservoir , discharging the air to form the grunting sound " Today all the sound @-@ making functions rely on the crank @-@ handle to power them , though Ord @-@ Hume believes this was not originally the case . 
 Works on the noise @-@ making functions included those made over several decades by the famous organ @-@ building firm Henry Willis & Sons , and Henry Willis III , who worked on the tiger in the 1950s , contributed an account to a monograph by Mildred Archer of the V & A. Ord @-@ Hume is generally ready to exempt Willis work from his scathing comments on other drastic restorations , which " vandalism " is assumed to be by unknown earlier organ @-@ builders . There was a detailed account of the sound @-@ making functions in The Penny Magazine in 1835 , whose anonymous author evidently understood " things mechanical and organs in particular " . From this and Ord @-@ Hume 's own investigations , he concluded that the original operation of the man 's " wail " had been intermittent , with a wail only being produced after every dozen or so grunts from the tiger above , but that at some date after 1835 the mechanism had been altered to make the wail continuous , and that the bellows for the wail had been replaced with smaller and weaker ones , and the operation of the moving arm altered . 
 <unk> features of the present instrument include the placing of the handle , which when turned is likely to obstruct a player of the keyboard . Ord @-@ Hume , using the 1835 account , concludes that originally the handle ( which is a nineteenth @-@ century British replacement , probably of a French original ) only operated the grunt and wail , while the organ was operated by pulling a string or cord to work the original bellows , now replaced . The keyboard , which is largely original , is " unique in construction " , with " square ivory buttons " with round lathe @-@ turned tops instead of conventional keys . Though the mechanical functioning of each button is " practical and convenient " they are spaced such that " it is almost impossible to stretch the hand to play an octave " . The buttons are marked with small black spots , differently placed but forming no apparent pattern in relation to the notes produced and corresponding to no known system of marking keys . The two stop control knobs for the organ are located , " rather confusingly " , a little below the tiger 's testicles . The instrument is now rarely played , but there is a V & A video of a recent performance .

 Tipu 's Tiger has provided inspiration to poets , sculptors , artists and others from the nineteenth century to the present day . The poet John Keats saw Tipu 's Tiger at the museum in Leadenhall Street and worked it into his satirical verse of 1819 , The Cap and Bells . In the poem , a soothsayer visits the court of the Emperor <unk> . He hears a strange noise and thinks the Emperor is snoring . 
 " <unk> the page : “ that little buzzing noise … . 
 Comes from a play @-@ thing of the Emperor ’ s choice , 
 From a Man @-@ Tiger @-@ Organ , prettiest of his toys " 
 The French poet , Auguste Barbier , described the tiger and its workings and meditated on its meaning in his poem , Le <unk> du Sultan ( The Plaything of the Sultan ) published in 1837 . More recently , the American Modernist poet , Marianne Moore wrote in her 1967 poem Tippoo 's Tiger about the workings of the automaton , though in fact the tail was never movable : 
 " The infidel claimed Tipu 's helmet and <unk> 
 and a vast toy - a curious automaton 
 a man killed by a tiger ; with organ pipes inside 
 from which blood @-@ curdling cries merged with inhuman groans . 
 The tiger moved its tail as the man moved his arm . " 
 Die Seele ( The Souls ) , a work by painter Jan <unk> ( 1913 – 2009 ) , shows an angel trumpeting over a flower garden while a tiger devours a uniformed French soldier . The Indian painter M. F. Husain painted Tipu 's Tiger in his characteristic style in 1986 titling the work as " Tipu Sultan 's Tiger " . The sculptor Dhruva Mistry , when a student at the Royal College of Art , adjacent to the Victoria and Albert Museum , frequently passed Tipu 's Tiger in its glass case and was inspired to make a fibre @-@ glass and plastic sculpture Tipu in 1986 . The sculpture Rabbit eating Astronaut ( 2004 ) by the artist Bill Reid is a humorous homage to the tiger , the rabbit " chomping " when its tail is cranked round .

 = Rock music = 
 Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as " rock and roll " in the United States in the 1950s , and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later , particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States . It has its roots in 1940s ' and 1950s ' rock and roll , itself heavily influenced by blues , rhythm and blues and country music . Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk , and incorporated influences from jazz , classical and other musical sources . 
 Musically , rock has centered on the electric guitar , usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar and drums . Typically , rock is song @-@ based music usually with a 4 / 4 time signature using a verse @-@ chorus form , but the genre has become extremely diverse . Like pop music , lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political in emphasis . The dominance of rock by white , male musicians has been seen as one of the key factors shaping the themes explored in rock music . Rock places a higher degree of emphasis on musicianship , live performance , and an ideology of authenticity than pop music . 
 By the late 1960s , referred to as the " golden age " or " classic rock " period , a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , raga rock , and jazz @-@ rock , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock , which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic scene . New genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted against the perceived overblown , inauthentic and overly mainstream aspects of these genres to produce a stripped @-@ down , energetic form of music valuing raw expression and often lyrically characterised by social and political critiques . Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other subgenres , including new wave , post @-@ punk and eventually the alternative rock movement . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock . Further fusion subgenres have since emerged , including pop punk , rap rock , and rap metal , as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock 's history , including the garage rock / post @-@ punk and synthpop revivals at the beginning of the new millennium . 
 Rock music has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements , leading to major sub @-@ cultures including mods and rockers in the UK and the hippie counterculture that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s . Similarly , 1970s punk culture spawned the visually distinctive goth and emo subcultures . Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song , rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race , sex and drug use , and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The sound of rock is traditionally centered on the amplified electric guitar , which emerged in its modern form in the 1950s with the popularization of rock and roll , and was influenced by the sounds of electric blues guitarists . The sound of an electric guitar in rock music is typically supported by an electric bass guitar , which pioneered in jazz music in the same era , and percussion produced from a drum kit that combines drums and cymbals . This trio of instruments has often been complemented by the inclusion of other instruments , particularly keyboards such as the piano , Hammond organ and synthesizers . The basic rock instrumentation was adapted from the basic blues band instrumentation ( prominent lead guitar , second chordal instrument , bass , and drums ) . A group of musicians performing rock music is termed a rock band or rock group and typically consists of between three – the power trio used in rock , metal and punk rock – and five members . Classically , a rock band takes the form of a quartet whose members cover one or more roles , including vocalist , lead guitarist , rhythm guitarist , bass guitarist , drummer and often that of keyboard player or other instrumentalist . 
 Rock music is traditionally built on a foundation of simple unsyncopated rhythms in a 4 / 4 meter , with a repetitive snare drum back beat on beats two and four . Melodies are often derived from older musical modes , including the Dorian and Mixolydian , as well as major and minor modes . Harmonies range from the common triad to parallel fourths and fifths and dissonant harmonic progressions . Rock songs , since the late 1950s and particularly from the mid @-@ 1960s onwards , often used the verse @-@ chorus structure derived from blues and folk music , but there has been considerable variation from this model . Critics have stressed the eclecticism and stylistic diversity of rock . Because of its complex history and tendency to borrow from other musical and cultural forms , it has been argued that " it is impossible to bind rock music to a rigidly delineated musical definition . " 
 Unlike many earlier styles of popular music , rock lyrics have dealt with a wide range of themes in addition to romantic love : including sex , rebellion against " The Establishment " , social concerns and life styles . These themes were inherited from a variety of sources , including the Tin Pan Alley pop tradition , folk music and rhythm and blues . Music journalist Robert Christgau characterizes rock lyrics as a " cool medium " with simple diction and repeated refrains , and asserts that rock 's primary " function " " pertains to music , or , more generally , noise . " The predominance of white , male and often middle class musicians in rock music has often been noted and rock has been seen as an appropriation of black musical forms for a young , white and largely male audience . As a result , it has been seen as articulating the concerns of this group in both style and lyrics . 
 Since the term rock began to be used in preference to rock and roll from the late @-@ 1960s , it has often been contrasted with pop music , with which it has shared many characteristics , but from which it is often distanced by an emphasis on musicianship , live performance and a focus on serious and progressive themes as part of an ideology of authenticity that is frequently combined with an awareness of the genre 's history and development . According to Simon Frith " rock was something more than pop , something more than rock and roll . Rock musicians combined an emphasis on skill and technique with the romantic concept of art as artistic expression , original and sincere " . In the new millennium the term rock has sometimes been used as a blanket term including forms such as pop music , reggae music , soul music , and even hip hop , with which it has been influenced but often contrasted through much of its history .

 = = = Rock and roll = = = 
 The foundations of rock music are in rock and roll , which originated in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s , and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world . Its immediate origins lay in a melding of various black musical genres of the time , including rhythm and blues and gospel music , with country and western . In 1951 , Cleveland , Ohio disc jockey Alan Freed began playing rhythm and blues music ( then termed " race music " ) for a multi @-@ racial audience , and is credited with first using the phrase " rock and roll " to describe the music . 
 Debate surrounds which record should be considered the first rock and roll record . Contenders include <unk> Carter 's " Rock Awhile " ( 1949 ) ; Jimmy Preston 's " Rock the Joint " ( 1949 ) , which was later covered by Bill Haley & His Comets in 1952 ; and " Rocket 88 " by Jackie <unk> and his Delta Cats ( in fact , Ike Turner and his band the Kings of Rhythm ) , recorded by Sam Phillips for Sun Records in 1951 . Four years later , Bill Haley 's " Rock Around the Clock " ( 1955 ) became the first rock and roll song to top Billboard magazine 's main sales and airplay charts , and opened the door worldwide for this new wave of popular culture . 
 It has also been argued that " That 's All Right ( Mama ) " ( 1954 ) , Elvis Presley 's first single for Sun Records in Memphis , could be the first rock and roll record , but , at the same time , Big Joe Turner 's " Shake , Rattle & Roll " , later covered by Haley , was already at the top of the Billboard R & B charts . Other artists with early rock and roll hits included Chuck Berry , Bo Diddley , Fats Domino , Little Richard , Jerry Lee Lewis , and Gene Vincent . Soon rock and roll was the major force in American record sales and crooners , such as Eddie Fisher , Perry Como , and Patti Page , who had dominated the previous decade of popular music , found their access to the pop charts significantly curtailed . 
 Rock and roll has been seen as leading to a number of distinct subgenres , including rockabilly , combining rock and roll with " hillbilly " country music , which was usually played and recorded in the mid @-@ 1950s by white singers such as Carl Perkins , Jerry Lee Lewis , Buddy Holly and with the greatest commercial success , Elvis Presley . In contrast doo wop placed an emphasis on multi @-@ part vocal harmonies and meaningless backing lyrics ( from which the genre later gained its name ) , which were usually supported with light instrumentation and had its origins in 1930s and 1940s African American vocal groups . Acts like the Crows , the Penguins , the El <unk> and the Turbans all scored major hits , and groups like the Platters , with songs including " The Great Pretender " ( 1955 ) , and the Coasters with humorous songs like " Yakety Yak " ( 1958 ) , ranked among the most successful rock and roll acts of the period . 
 The era also saw the growth in popularity of the electric guitar , and the development of a specifically rock and roll style of playing through such exponents as Chuck Berry , Link Wray , and Scotty Moore . The use of distortion , pioneered by electric blues guitarists such as Guitar Slim , Willie Johnson and Pat Hare in the early 1950s , was popularized by Chuck Berry in the mid @-@ 1950s . The use of power chords , pioneered by Willie Johnson and Pat Hare in the early 1950s , was popularized by Link Wray in the late 1950s . 
 In the United Kingdom , the trad jazz and folk movements brought visiting blues music artists to Britain . Lonnie Donegan 's 1955 hit " Rock Island Line " was a major influence and helped to develop the trend of skiffle music groups throughout the country , many of which , including John Lennon 's Quarrymen , moved on to play rock and roll . 
 Commentators have traditionally perceived a decline of rock and roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s . By 1959 , the death of Buddy Holly , The Big Bopper and Richie Valens in a plane crash , the departure of Elvis for the army , the retirement of Little Richard to become a preacher , prosecutions of Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry and the breaking of the payola scandal ( which implicated major figures , including Alan Freed , in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs ) , gave a sense that the rock and roll era established at that point had come to an end .

 The period of the later 1950s and early 1960s , between the end of the initial period of innovation and what became known in the US as the " British Invasion " , has traditionally been seen as an era of hiatus for rock and roll . More recently some authors have emphasised important innovations and trends in this period without which future developments would not have been possible . While early rock and roll , particularly through the advent of rockabilly , saw the greatest commercial success for male and white performers , in this era the genre was dominated by black and female artists . Rock and roll had not disappeared at the end of the 1950s and some of its energy can be seen in the Twist dance craze of the early 1960s , mainly benefiting the career of Chubby Checker . Having died down in the late 1950s , doo wop enjoyed a revival in the same period , with hits for acts like the <unk> , the <unk> , Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs , and Shep and the <unk> . The rise of girl groups like the Chantels , the Shirelles and the Crystals placed an emphasis on harmonies and polished production that was in contrast to earlier rock and roll . Some of the most significant girl group hits were products of the Brill Building Sound , named after the block in New York where many songwriters were based , which included the number 1 hit for the Shirelles " Will You Love Me Tomorrow " in 1960 , penned by the partnership of Gerry Goffin and Carole King . 
 Cliff Richard had the first British rock and roll hit with " Move It " , effectively ushering in the sound of British rock . At the start of the 1960s , his backing group the Shadows was the most successful group recording instrumentals . While rock ' n ' roll was fading into lightweight pop and ballads , British rock groups at clubs and local dances , heavily influenced by blues @-@ rock pioneers like Alexis Korner , were starting to play with an intensity and drive seldom found in white American acts . 
 Also significant was the advent of soul music as a major commercial force . Developing out of rhythm and blues with a re @-@ injection of gospel music and pop , led by pioneers like Ray Charles and Sam Cooke from the mid @-@ 1950s , by the early 1960s figures like Marvin Gaye , James Brown , Aretha Franklin , Curtis Mayfield and Stevie Wonder were dominating the R & B charts and breaking through into the main pop charts , helping to accelerate their desegregation , while Motown and Stax / Volt Records were becoming major forces in the record industry . All of these elements , including the close harmonies of doo wop and girl groups , the carefully crafted song @-@ writing of the Brill Building Sound and the polished production values of soul , have been seen as influencing the Merseybeat sound , particularly the early work of The Beatles , and through them the form of later rock music . Some historians of music have also pointed to important and innovative technical developments that built on rock and roll in this period , including the electronic treatment of sound by such innovators as Joe Meek , and the elaborate production methods of the Wall of Sound pursued by Phil Spector . 
 = = = Surf music = = = 
 The instrumental rock and roll of performers such as Duane Eddy , Link Wray and the Ventures was developed by Dick Dale , who added distinctive " wet " reverb , rapid alternate picking , and Middle Eastern and Mexican influences . He produced the regional hit " Let 's Go Trippin ' " in 1961 and launched the surf music craze , following up with songs like " Misirlou " ( 1962 ) . Like Dale and his Del @-@ Tones , most early surf bands were formed in Southern California , including the Bel @-@ Airs , the Challengers , and Eddie & the Showmen . The <unk> scored a top ten national hit with " Pipeline " in 1963 and probably the best known surf tune was 1963 's " Wipe Out " , by the Surfaris , which hit number 2 and number 10 on the Billboard charts in 1965 . 
 Groups which crossed over to this genre included the Astronauts , from Boulder , Colorado ; the Trashmen , from Minneapolis , Minnesota , who had a number 4 hit with " Surfin Bird " in 1964 ; and the Rivieras from South Bend , Indiana , who reached number 5 in 1964 with " California Sun " . The Atlantics , from Sydney , made a significant contribution to the genre , with their hit " <unk> " ( 1963 ) . European instrumental bands around this time generally focused more on the more rock and roll style played by The Shadows , but the Dakotas , who were the British backing band for Merseybeat singer Billy J. Kramer , gained some attention as surf musicians with " Cruel Sea " ( 1963 ) , which was later covered by American instrumental surf bands , including the Ventures . 
 Surf music achieved its greatest commercial success as vocal music , particularly the work of the Beach Boys , formed in 1961 in Southern California . Their early albums included both instrumental surf rock ( among them covers of music by Dick Dale ) and vocal songs , drawing on rock and roll and doo wop and the close harmonies of vocal pop acts like the Four Freshmen . Their first chart hit , " Surfin ' " in 1962 reached the Billboard top 100 and helped make the surf music craze a national phenomenon . From 1963 the group began to leave surfing behind as subject matter as Brian Wilson became their major composer and producer , moving on to the more general themes of male adolescence including cars and girls in songs like " Fun , Fun , Fun " ( 1964 ) and " California Girls " ( 1965 ) . Other vocal surf acts followed , including one @-@ hit wonders like Ronny & the <unk> with " G. T. O. " ( 1964 ) and Rip Chords with " Hey Little Cobra " , which both reached the top ten , but the only other act to achieve sustained success with the formula were Jan & Dean , who had a number 1 hit with " Surf City " ( co @-@ written with Brian Wilson ) in 1963 . The surf music craze and the careers of almost all surf acts was effectively ended by the arrival of the British Invasion from 1964 . Only the Beach Boys were able to sustain a creative career into the mid @-@ 1960s , producing a string of hit singles and albums , including the highly regarded Pet Sounds in 1966 , which made them , arguably , the only American rock or pop act that could rival The Beatles .

 By the end of 1962 , what would become the British rock scene had started with beat groups like the Beatles , Gerry & the Pacemakers and the Searchers from Liverpool and Freddie and the Dreamers , Herman 's Hermits and the Hollies from Manchester . They drew on a wide range of American influences including soul , rhythm and blues and surf music , initially reinterpreting standard American tunes and playing for dancers . Bands like the Animals from Newcastle and Them from Belfast , and particularly those from London like the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds , were much more directly influenced by rhythm and blues and later blues music . Soon these groups were composing their own material , combining US forms of music and infusing it with a high energy beat . Beat bands tended towards " bouncy , irresistible melodies " , while early British rhythm and blues acts tended towards less sexually innocent , more aggressive songs , often adopting an anti @-@ establishment stance . There was , however , particularly in the early stages , considerable musical crossover between the two tendencies . By 1963 , led by the Beatles , beat groups had begun to achieve national success in Britain , soon to be followed into the charts by the more rhythm and blues focused acts . 
 " I Want to Hold Your Hand " was the Beatles ' first number 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 , spending 7 weeks at the top and a total of 15 weeks on the chart . Their first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show on 9 February 1964 , drawing an estimated 73 million viewers ( at the time a record for an American television program ) is often considered a milestone in American pop culture . The Beatles went on to become the biggest selling rock band of all time and they were followed into the US charts by numerous British bands . During the next two years British acts dominated their own and the US charts with Peter and Gordon , the Animals , Manfred Mann , Petula Clark , Freddie and the Dreamers , Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders , Herman 's Hermits , the Rolling Stones , the Troggs , and Donovan all having one or more number one singles . Other major acts that were part of the invasion included the Kinks and the Dave Clark Five . 
 The British Invasion helped internationalize the production of rock and roll , opening the door for subsequent British ( and Irish ) performers to achieve international success . In America it arguably spelled the end of instrumental surf music , vocal girl groups and ( for a time ) the teen idols , that had dominated the American charts in the late 1950s and 1960s . It dented the careers of established R & B acts like Fats Domino and Chubby Checker and even temporarily derailed the chart success of surviving rock and roll acts , including Elvis . The British Invasion also played a major part in the rise of a distinct genre of rock music , and cemented the primacy of the rock group , based on guitars and drums and producing their own material as singer @-@ songwriters . 
 = = = Garage rock = = = 
 Garage rock was a raw form of rock music , particularly prevalent in North America in the mid @-@ 1960s and so called because of the perception that it was rehearsed in the suburban family garage . Garage rock songs often revolved around the traumas of high school life , with songs about " lying girls " being particularly common . The lyrics and delivery tended to be more aggressive than was common at the time , often with growled or shouted vocals that dissolved into incoherent screaming . They ranged from crude one @-@ chord music ( like the Seeds ) to near @-@ studio musician quality ( including the Knickerbockers , the Remains , and the Fifth Estate ) . There were also regional variations in many parts of the country with flourishing scenes particularly in California and Texas . The Pacific Northwest states of Washington and Oregon had perhaps the most defined regional sound . 
 The style had been evolving from regional scenes as early as 1958 . " Tall Cool One " ( 1959 ) by The Wailers and " Louie Louie " by the Kingsmen ( 1963 ) are mainstream examples of the genre in its formative stages . By 1963 , garage band singles were creeping into the national charts in greater numbers , including Paul Revere and the Raiders ( Boise ) , the Trashmen ( Minneapolis ) and the Rivieras ( South Bend , Indiana ) . Other influential garage bands , such as the Sonics ( Tacoma , Washington ) , never reached the Billboard Hot 100 . In this early period many bands were heavily influenced by surf rock and there was a cross @-@ pollination between garage rock and frat rock , sometimes viewed as merely a subgenre of garage rock . 
 The British Invasion of 1964 – 66 greatly influenced garage bands , providing them with a national audience , leading many ( often surf or hot rod groups ) to adopt a British influence , and encouraging many more groups to form . Thousands of garage bands were extant in the US and Canada during the era and hundreds produced regional hits . Examples include : " The Witch " by Tacoma 's the Sonics ( 1965 ) , " Where You Gonna Go " by Detroit 's Unrelated Segments ( 1967 ) , " Girl I Got News for You " by Miami 's Birdwatchers ( 1966 ) and " 1 – 2 – 5 " by Montreal 's the Haunted . Despite scores of bands being signed to major or large regional labels , most were commercial failures . It is generally agreed that garage rock peaked both commercially and artistically around 1966 . By 1968 the style largely disappeared from the national charts and at the local level as amateur musicians faced college , work or the draft . New styles had evolved to replace garage rock ( including blues rock , progressive rock and country rock ) . In Detroit , garage rock 's legacy remained alive into the early 1970s , with bands such as the MC5 and the Stooges , who employed a much more aggressive approach to the form . These bands began to be labelled punk rock and are now often seen as proto @-@ punk or proto @-@ hard rock .
