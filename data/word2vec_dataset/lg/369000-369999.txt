 West of the ancient walls , the Palmyrenes built a number of large @-@ scale funerary monuments which now form the Valley of Tombs , a 1 @-@ kilometre @-@ long ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) necropolis . The more than 50 monuments were primarily tower @-@ shaped and up to four stories high .

 The senate building is largely ruined . It is a small building that consists of a peristyle courtyard and a chamber that has an apse at one end and rows of seats around it . 
 Much of the Baths of Diocletian are ruined and do not survive above the level of the foundations . The complex 's entrance is marked by four massive Egyptian granite columns each 1 @.@ 3 metres ( 4 ft 3 in ) in diameter , 12 @.@ 5 metres ( 41 ft ) high and weigh 20 tonnes . Inside , the outline of a bathing pool surrounded by a colonnade of Corinthian columns is still visible in addition to an octagonal room that served as a dressing room containing a drain in its center . 
 The Agora of Palmyra is part of a complex that also includes the tariff court and the triclinium , built in the second half of the first century AD . The agora is a massive 71 by 84 metres ( 233 by 276 ft ) structure with 11 entrances . Inside the agora , 200 columnar bases that used to hold statues of prominent citizens were found . The inscriptions on the bases allowed an understanding of the order by which the statues were grouped ; the eastern side was reserved for senators , the northern side for Palmyrene officials , the western side for soldiers and the southern side for caravan chiefs . 
 The Tariff Court is a large rectangular enclosure south of the agora and sharing its northern wall with it . Originally , the entrance of the court was a massive vestibule in its southwestern wall . However , the entrance was blocked by the construction of a defensive wall and the court was entered through three doors from the Agora . The court gained its name by containing a 5 meters long stone slab that had the Palmyrene tax law inscribed on it . 
 The <unk> of the Agora is located to the northwestern corner of the Agora and can host up to 40 person . It is a small 12 by 15 metres ( 39 by 49 ft ) hall decorated with Greek key motifs that run in a continuous line halfway up the wall . The building was probably used by the rulers of the city ; Henri Arnold Seyrig proposed that it was a small temple before being turned into a triclinium or banqueting hall . 
 = = = = Temples = = = = 
 The Temple of Bel was dedicated in 32 AD ; it consist of a large precinct lined by porticos ; it had a rectangular shape and was oriented north @-@ south . The exterior wall was 205 @-@ metre ( 673 ft ) long with a propylaea , and the cella stood on a podium in the middle of the enclosure . 
 The Temple of Baalshamin dates to the late 2nd century BC in its earliest phases ; its altar was built in 115 AD , and it was substantially rebuilt in 131 AD . It consisted of a central cella and two colonnaded courtyards north and south of the central structure . A vestibule consisting of six columns preceded the cella which had its side walls decorated with pilasters in Corinthian order . 
 The Temple of Nabu is largely ruined . The temple was Eastern in its plan ; the outer enclosure 's propylaea led to a 20 by 9 metres ( 66 by 30 ft ) podium through a portico of which the bases of the columns survives . The peristyle cella opened onto an outdoor altar . 
 The Temple of Al @-@ lāt is largely ruined with only a podium , a few columns and the door frame remaining . Inside the compound , a giant lion relief ( Lion of Al @-@ lāt ) was excavated and in its original form , was a relief protruding from the temple compound 's wall . 
 The ruined Temple of Baal @-@ hamon was located on the top of Jabal al @-@ Muntar hill which oversees the spring of Efqa . Constructed in 89 AD , it consisted of a cella and a vestibule with two columns . The temple had a defensive tower attached to it ; a mosaic depicting the sanctuary was excavated and it revealed that both the cella and the vestibule were decorated with merlons .

 The Great Colonnade was Palmyra 's 1 @.@ 1 @-@ kilometre @-@ long ( 0 @.@ 68 mi ) main street ; most of the columns date to the second century AD and each is 9 @.@ 50 metres ( 31 @.@ 2 ft ) high . 
 The Funerary Temple <unk> ( also known as the House Tomb ) is located at the western end of the Great Colonnade . It was built in the third century AD and has a portico of six columns and vine patterns carvings . Inside the chamber , steps leads down to a vault crypt . The shrine might have been connected to the royal family as it is the only tomb inside the city 's walls . 
 The <unk> was erected during the renovations of Diocletian at the end of the third century . It is a square platform and each corner contains a grouping of four columns . Each column group supports a 150 tons cornice and contains a pedestal in its center that originally carried a statue . Out of sixteen columns , only one is original while the rest are from reconstruction work by the Syrian Directorate @-@ General of Antiquities in 1963 , using concrete . The original columns were brought from Egypt and carved out of pink granite . 
 The city 's current walls were erected during the reign of Diocletian whose fortification of the city enclosed a much smaller area than the original pre @-@ 273 city . The Diocletianic walls had protective towers and fortified gateways . 
 The pre @-@ 273 walls were narrow and while encircling the whole city , they do not seem to have provided real protection against an invasion . No signs of towers or fortified gates exist and it cannot be proven that the walls enclosed the city as many gaps appears to have never been defended . The earlier walls seem to have been designed to protect the city against Bedouins and to provide a costume barrier .

 Palmyra entered the historical record during the Bronze Age around 2000 BC , when <unk> @-@ Ishtar the <unk> ( Palmyrene ) agreed to a contract at an Assyrian trading colony in <unk> . It was mentioned next in the Mari tablets as a stop for trade caravans and nomadic tribes , such as the <unk> . King Shamshi @-@ Adad I of Assyria passed through the area on his way to the Mediterranean at the beginning of the 18th century BC ; by then , Palmyra was the easternmost point of the kingdom of Qatna . Palmyra was part of the kingdom of <unk> in the 14th century BC , and was mentioned in a 13th @-@ century BC tablet discovered at Emar , which recorded the names of two " <unk> " witnesses . At the beginning of the 11th century BC , King Tiglath @-@ Pileser I of Assyria recorded his defeat of the " Arameans " of " <unk> " . 
 The Hebrew Bible ( Second Book of Chronicles 8 : 4 ) records a city by the name " Tadmor " as a desert city built ( or fortified ) by King Solomon of Israel ; Flavius Josephus mentions the Greek name " Palmyra " , attributing its founding to Solomon in Book VIII of his Antiquities of the Jews . Later Islamic traditions attribute the city 's founding to Solomon 's Jinn . The association of Palmyra with Solomon is a conflation of " Tadmor " and a city built by Solomon in Judea and known as " Tamar " in the Books of Kings ( 1 Kings 9 : 18 ) . The biblical description of " Tadmor " and its buildings does not fit archaeological findings in Palmyra , which was a small settlement during Solomon 's reign in the 10th century BC . 
 = = = Hellenistic and Roman periods = = = 
 During the Hellenistic period under the Seleucids ( between 312 and 64 BC ) , Palmyra became a prosperous settlement owing allegiance to the Seleucid king . In 217 BC , a Palmyrene force led by Zabdibel joined the army of King Antiochus III in the Battle of Raphia which ended in a Seleucid defeat by Ptolemaic Egypt . In the middle of the Hellenistic era , Palmyra , formerly south of the al @-@ Qubur wadi , began to expand beyond its northern bank . By the late second century BC , the tower tombs in the Palmyrene Valley of Tombs and the city temples ( most notably , the temples of Baalshamin , Al @-@ lāt and the Hellenistic temple ) began to be built . 
 In 64 BC the Roman Republic annexed the Seleucid kingdom , and the Roman general Pompey established the province of Syria . Palmyra was left independent , trading with Rome and Parthia but belonging to neither . The earliest known Palmyrene inscription is dated to around 44 BC ; Palmyra was still a minor sheikhdom , offering water to caravans which occasionally took the desert route on which it was located . However , according to Appian Palmyra was wealthy enough for Mark Antony to send a force to conquer it in 41 BC . The Palmyrenes evacuated to Parthian lands beyond the eastern bank of the Euphrates , which they prepared to defend . 
 = = = = Autonomous Palmyrene region = = = = 
 Palmyra became part of the Roman Empire when it was annexed and paid tribute early in the reign of Tiberius , around 14 AD . The Romans included Palmyra in the province of Syria , and defined the region 's boundaries ; a boundary marker laid by Roman governor Silanus was found 75 kilometres ( 47 mi ) northwest of the city at Khirbet el @-@ <unk> . A marker at the city 's southwestern border was found at Qasr al @-@ <unk> al @-@ Gharbi , and its eastern border extended to the Euphrates valley . This region included numerous villages subordinate to the center such as al @-@ Qaryatayn ( 35 other settlements have been identified by 2012 ) . The Roman imperial period brought great prosperity to the city , which enjoyed a privileged status under the empire — retaining much of its internal autonomy , being ruled by a council , and incorporating many Greek city @-@ state ( polis ) institutions into its government . 
 The earliest Palmyrene text attesting a Roman presence in the city dates to 18 AD , when the Roman general Germanicus tried to develop a friendly relationship with Parthia ; he sent the Palmyrene Alexandros to <unk> , a Parthian vassal kingdom . This was followed by the arrival of the Roman legion Legio X Fretensis the following year . Roman authority was minimal during the first century AD , although tax collectors were resident , and a road connecting Palmyra and Sura was built in 75 AD . The Romans used Palmyrene soldiers , but ( unlike typical Roman cities ) no local magistrates or prefects are recorded in the city . Palmyra saw intensive construction during the first century , including the city 's first walled fortifications and the Temple of Bel ( completed and dedicated in 32 AD ) . During the first century Palmyra developed from a minor desert caravan station into a leading trading center , with Palmyrene merchants establishing colonies in surrounding trade centers . 
 Palmyrene trade reached its apex during the second century , aided by two factors ; the first was a trade route built by Palmyrenes , and protected by garrisons at major locations , including a garrison in Dura @-@ Europos manned in 117 AD . The second was the Roman annexation of the <unk> capital Petra in 106 , shifting control over southern trade routes of the Arabian Peninsula from the Nabataeans to Palmyra . 
 In 129 Palmyra was visited by Hadrian , who named it " <unk> Palmyra " and made it a free city . Hadrian promoted Hellenism throughout the empire , and Palmyra 's urban expansion was modeled on that of Greece . This led to new projects , including the theatre , the colonnade and the Temple of Nabu . Roman authority in Palmyra was reinforced in 167 , when the cavalry Ala I <unk> <unk> garrison was moved to the city . By the end of the second century , urban development diminished after the city 's building projects peaked . 
 In the 190s , Palmyra was assigned to the province of Phoenice , newly created by the Severan dynasty . Toward the end of the second century , Palmyra began a steady transition from a traditional Greek city @-@ state to a monarchy due to the increasing militarization of the city and the deteriorating economic situation ; the Severan ascension to the imperial throne in Rome played a major role in Palmyra 's transition : 
 The Severan @-@ led Roman – Parthian War , from 194 to 217 , influenced regional security and affected the city 's trade . Bandits began attacking caravans by 199 , leading Palmyra to strengthen its military presence . The city devoted more energy to protecting the Roman east than to commerce , and its importance increased . 
 The new dynasty favored the city , stationing the Cohors I Flavia <unk> garrison there by 206 . Caracalla made Palmyra a colonia between 213 and 216 , replacing many Greek institutions with Roman constitutional ones . Severus Alexander , emperor from 222 to 235 , visited Palmyra in 229 .

 The rise of the Sasanian Empire in Persia considerably damaged Palmyrene trade . The Sasanians disbanded Palmyrene colonies in their lands , and began a war against the Roman empire . In an inscription dated to 252 Odaenathus appears bearing the title of <unk> ( lord ) of Palmyra . The weakness of the Roman empire and the constant Persian danger were probably the reasons behind the Palmyrene council 's decision to elect a lord for the city in order for him to lead a strengthened army . Odaenathus approached Shapur I of Persia to request him to guarantee Palmyrene interests in Persia , but was rebuffed . In 260 the Emperor Valerian fought Shapur at the Battle of Edessa , but was defeated and captured . One of Valerian 's officers , Macrianus Major , his sons Quietus and Macrianus , and the prefect Balista rebelled against Valerian 's son Gallienus , usurping imperial power in Syria . 
 = = = = = Persian wars = = = = = 
 Odaenathus formed an army of Palmyrenes and Syrian peasants against Shapur . According to the Augustan History , Odaenathus declared himself king prior to the battle . The Palmyrene leader won a decisive victory near the banks of the Euphrates later in 260 forcing the Persians to retreat . In 261 Odaenathus marched against the remaining usurpers in Syria , defeating and killing Quietus and Balista . As a reward , he received the title Imperator <unk> Orientis ( " Governor of the East " ) from Gallienus , and ruled Syria , Mesopotamia , Arabia and Anatolia 's eastern regions as the imperial representative . Palmyra itself remained officially part of the empire but Palmyrene inscriptions started to describe it as a " <unk> " , indicating that the city 's status was higher than normal Roman colonias . In practice , Palmyra shifted from a provincial city to a de facto allied kingdom . 
 In 262 Odaenathus launched a new campaign against Shapur , reclaiming the rest of Roman Mesopotamia ( most importantly , the cities of Nisibis and Carrhae ) , sacking the Jewish city of Nehardea , and besieging the Persian capital Ctesiphon . Following his victory , the Palmyrene monarch assumed the title King of Kings . Later , Odaenathus crowned his son Hairan I as co @-@ King of Kings near Antioch in 263 . 
 Although he did not take the Persian capital , Odaenathus drove the Persians out of all Roman lands conquered since the beginning of Shapur 's wars in 252 . In a second campaign , the Palmyrene king defeated the Persians in 266 near Ctesiphon . In 267 , Odaenathus , accompanied by Hairan I , moved north to repel Gothic attacks on Asia Minor . The king and his son were assassinated during their return ; according to the Augustan History and Joannes Zonaras , Odaenathus was killed by a cousin ( Zonaras says nephew ) named in the History as Maeonius . The Augustan History also says that Maeonius was proclaimed emperor for a brief period before being killed by the soldiers . However , no inscriptions or other evidence exist for Maeonius ' reign and he was probably killed immediately after assassinating Odaenathus . 
 Odaenathus was succeeded by his son ; the ten @-@ year @-@ old Vaballathus . Zenobia , the mother of the new king , was the de facto ruler and Vaballathus remained in her shadow while she consolidated her power . Gallienus dispatched his prefect Heraclian to command military operations against the Persians , but he was marginalized by Zenobia and returned to the West . The queen was careful not to provoke Rome , claiming for herself and her son the titles held by her husband while guaranteeing the safety of the borders with Persia and pacifying the <unk> in Hauran . To protect the borders with Persia , Zenobia fortified different settlements on the Euphrates including the citadels of <unk> and <unk> . Circumstantial evidence exist for confrontations with the Sasanians ; probably in 269 Vaballathus took the title <unk> Maximus ( " The great victor in Persia " ) and the title might be linked with an unrecorded battle against a Persian army trying to regain control of Northern Mesopotamia . 
 = = = = = Palmyrene empire = = = = = 
 Zenobia began her military career in the spring of 270 , during the reign of Claudius Gothicus . Under the pretext of attacking the <unk> , she annexed Roman Arabia . This was followed in October by an invasion of Egypt , ending with a Palmyrene victory and Zenobia 's proclamation as queen of Egypt . Palmyra invaded Anatolia the following year , reaching Ankara and the pinnacle of its expansion . 
 The conquests were made behind a mask of subordination to Rome . Zenobia issued coins in the name of Claudius ' successor Aurelian , with Vaballathus depicted as king ; since Aurelian was occupied with repelling insurgencies in Europe , he permitted the Palmyrene coinage and conferred the royal titles . In late 271 , Vaballathus and his mother assumed the titles of Augustus ( emperor ) and Augusta . 
 The following year , Aurelian crossed the Bosphorus and advanced quickly through Anatolia . According to one account , Roman general Marcus Aurelius Probus regained Egypt from Palmyra ; Aurelian entered Issus and headed to Antioch , where he defeated Zenobia in the Battle of <unk> . Zenobia was defeated again at the Battle of Emesa , taking refuge in Homs before quickly returning to her capital . When the Romans besieged Palmyra , Zenobia refused their order to surrender in person to the emperor . She escaped east to ask the Persians for help , but was captured by the Romans ; the city capitulated soon afterwards . 
 = = = = Later Roman and Byzantine periods = = = = 
 Aurelian spared the city and stationed a garrison of 600 archers , led by <unk> , as a peacekeeping force . In 273 Palmyra rebelled under the leadership of Septimius <unk> , declaring Antiochus ( a relative of Zenobia ) as Augustus . Aurelian marched against Palmyra , razing it to the ground and seizing the most valuable monuments to decorate his Temple of Sol . Palmyrene buildings were smashed , residents massacred and the Temple of Bel pillaged . 
 Palmyra was reduced to a village without territory . Aurelian repaired the Temple of Bel , and the Legio I Illyricorum was stationed in the city . Shortly before 303 the Camp of Diocletian , a castra in the western part of the city , was built . The 4 @-@ hectare ( 9 @.@ 9 @-@ acre ) camp was a base for the Legio I Illyricorum , which guarded the trade routes around the city . 
 Palmyra became a Christian city in the decades following its destruction by Aurelian . In late 527 , Justinian I ordered its fortification and the restoration of its churches and public buildings to protect the empire against raids by Lakhmid king Al @-@ Mundhir III ibn al @-@ Nu 'man .

 Palmyra was annexed by the Rashidun Caliphate after its 634 capture by the Muslim general Khalid ibn al @-@ Walid , who took the city after an 18 @-@ day march by his army through the Syrian Desert from Mesopotamia . By then Palmyra was limited to the Diocletian camp . After the conquest , the city became part of Homs Province . 
 = = = = Umayyad and early Abbasid periods = = = = 
 Palmyra prospered as part of the Umayyad Caliphate , and its population grew . It was a key stop on the East @-@ West trade route , with a large souq ( market ) , built by the Umayyads , who also commissioned part of the Temple of Bel as a mosque . During this period , Palmyra was a stronghold of the Banu Kalb tribe . After being defeated by Marwan II during a civil war in the caliphate , Umayyad contender Sulayman ibn Hisham fled to the Banu Kalb in Palmyra , but eventually pledged allegiance to Marwan in 744 ; Palmyra continued to oppose Marwan until the surrender of the Banu Kalb leader al @-@ <unk> al @-@ Kalbi in 745 . That year , Marwan ordered the city 's walls demolished . 
 In 750 a revolt , led by <unk> 'a ibn al @-@ Kawthar and Umayyad pretender Abu Muhammad al @-@ <unk> , against the new Abbasid Caliphate swept across Syria ; the tribes in Palmyra supported the rebels . After his defeat Abu Muhammad took refuge in the city , which withstood an Abbasid assault long enough to allow him to escape . 
 = = = = Decentralization = = = = 
 Abbasid power dwindled during the 10th century , when the empire disintegrated and was divided among a number of vassals . Most of the new rulers acknowledged the caliph as their nominal sovereign , a situation which continued until the Mongol destruction of the Abbasid Caliphate in 1258 . 
 In 955 Sayf al @-@ Dawla , the Hamdanid prince of Aleppo , defeated the nomads near the city , and built a kasbah ( fortress ) in response to campaigns by the Byzantine emperors Nikephoros II Phokas and John I Tzimiskes . After the early @-@ 11th @-@ century Hamdanid collapse , Palmyra was controlled by the successor Mirdasid dynasty . Earthquakes devastated the city in 1068 and 1089 . The Mirdasids were followed in the second half of the 11th century by Khalaf of the Mala 'ib tribe , centered in Homs . In the 1070s Syria was conquered by the Seljuk Empire , whose sultan Malik @-@ Shah I expelled the Mala 'ib and imprisoned Khalaf in 1090 . Khalaf 's lands were given to Malik @-@ Shah 's brother , Tutush I , who gained his independence after his brother 's 1092 death and established a cadet branch of the Seljuk dynasty in Syria . 
 During the early 12th century Palmyra was ruled by Toghtekin , the Burid atabeg of Damascus , who appointed his nephew governor . Toghtekin 's nephew was killed by rebels , and the atabeg retook the city in 1126 . Palmyra was given to Toghtekin 's grandson , Shihab @-@ ud @-@ din Mahmud , who was replaced by governor Yusuf ibn Firuz when Shihab @-@ ud @-@ din Mahmud returned to Damascus after his father Taj al @-@ Muluk Buri succeeded Toghtekin . The Burids transformed the Temple of Bel into a citadel in 1132 , fortifying the city , and transferring it to the Bin <unk> family three years later in exchange for Homs . 
 During the mid @-@ 12th century , Palmyra was ruled by the Zengid king Nur ad @-@ Din Mahmud . It became part of the district of Homs , which was given as a fiefdom to the Ayyubid general Shirkuh in 1167 and confiscated after his death in 1169 . Homs was annexed by the Ayyubid sultanate in 1174 ; the following year , Saladin gave Homs ( including Palmyra ) to his cousin Nasir al @-@ Din Muhammad as a fiefdom . After Saladin 's death , the Ayyubid realm was divided and Palmyra was given to Nasir al @-@ Din Muhammad 's son Al @-@ Mujahid Shirkuh II ( who built the castle of Palmyra known as Fakhr @-@ al @-@ Din al @-@ <unk> Castle around 1230 ) .

 The Al Fadl clan ( a branch of the Tayy tribe ) declared its loyalty to the Mamluks , and in 1281 , Prince Issa bin Muhanna of the Al Fadl was appointed lord of Palmyra by sultan Qalawun .

Muhanna declared his loyalty to Öljaitü of the Ilkhanate in 1312 and was dismissed and replaced with his brother Fadl by sultan an @-@ Nasir Muhammad . Although Muhanna was forgiven by an @-@ Nasir and restored in 1317 , he and his tribe were expelled in 1320 for his continued relations with the Ilkhanate and he was replaced by tribal chief Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr . 
 Muhanna was forgiven and restored by an @-@ Nasir in 1330 ; he remained loyal to the sultan until his death in 1335 , when he was succeeded by his son . Contemporary historian Ibn Fadlallah al @-@ Omari described the city as having " vast gardens , flourishing trades and bizarre monuments " . The Al Fadl clan protected the trade routes and villages from Bedouin raids , raiding other cities and fighting among themselves . The Mamluks intervened militarily several times , dismissing , imprisoning or expelling its leaders . In 1400 Palmyra was attacked by Timur , who took 200 @,@ 000 sheep and destroyed the city .

 Syria became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1516 , and Palmyra was incorporated into Damascus Eyalet as the center of an administrative district ( sanjak ) . During the Ottoman era , Palmyra was a small village in the courtyard of the Temple of Bel . After 1568 the Ottomans appointed the Lebanese prince Ali bin Musa <unk> as governor of Palmyra 's sanjak , dismissing him in 1584 for treason . 
 In 1630 Palmyra came under the authority of another Lebanese prince , Fakhr @-@ al @-@ Din II , who renovated Shirkuh II 's castle ( which became known as Fakhr @-@ al @-@ Din al @-@ <unk> Castle ) . The prince fell from grace with the Ottomans in 1633 and lost control of the village , which remained a separate sanjak until it was absorbed by Zor Sanjak in 1857 . The village became home to an Ottoman garrison to control the Bedouin in 1867 . 
 Palmyra regained some of its importance at the beginning of the 20th century as a station for caravans , and its revival was aided by the advent of motorized transport . In 1918 , as World War I was ending , the Royal Air Force built an airfield for two planes , and in November the Ottomans retreated from Zor Sanjak without a fight . The Syrian Emirate 's army entered Deir ez @-@ Zor on 4 December , and Zor Sanjak became part of Syria . In 1919 , as the British and French argued over the borders of the planned mandates , the British permanent military representative to the Supreme War Council Henry Wilson suggested adding Palmyra to the British mandate . However , the British general Edmund Allenby persuaded his government to abandon this plan . Syria ( including Palmyra ) became part of the French Mandate after Syria 's defeat in the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July 1920 . 
 As Palmyra gained importance to French efforts to pacify the Syrian Desert , a base was constructed in the village near the Temple of Bel in 1921 . In 1929 the general director of antiquities in Syria , Henri Arnold Seyrig , began excavating the ruins and convinced the villagers to move to a new , French @-@ built village next to the site . The relocation was completed in 1932 ; ancient Palmyra was ready for excavation as its villagers settled into the new village of Tadmur .

 As a result of the Syrian Civil War , Palmyra experienced widespread looting and damage by combatants . During the summer of 2012 , concerns about looting in the museum and the site increased when an amateur video of Syrian soldiers carrying funerary stones was posted . However , according to France 24 's report , " From the information gathered , it is impossible to determine whether pillaging was taking place . " The following year the façade of the Temple of Bel sustained a large hole from mortar fire , and colonnade columns have been damaged by shrapnel . According to <unk> <unk> , director of antiquities and museums at the Syrian Ministry of Culture , the Syrian Army positioned its troops in some archaeological @-@ site areas , while Syrian opposition fighters positioned themselves in gardens around the city . 
 On 13 May 2015 , ISIL launched an attack on the modern town of Tadmur , sparking fears that the iconoclastic group would destroy the adjacent ancient site of Palmyra . On 21 May , some artifacts were transported from the Palmyra museum to Damascus for safekeeping . A number of Greco @-@ Roman busts , jewelry , and other objects looted from the museum have been found on the international market . ISIL forces entered Palmyra on the same day . Local residents reported that the Syrian air force bombed the site on 13 June , damaging the northern wall close to the Temple of Baalshamin . Since at least 27 May , Palmyra 's theatre was used as a place of public executions of ISIL opponents . A video released by ISIL shows the killing of 20 prisoners by teenage male executioners in front of hundreds of men and boys . On 18 August , Palmyra 's retired antiquities chief Khaled al @-@ Asaad was beheaded by ISIL after being tortured for a month to extract information about the city and its treasures ; al @-@ Asaad refused to give any information to his captors . 
 Syrian government forces backed by Russian airstrikes recaptured Palmyra on 27 March 2016 after intense fighting against ISIL fighters . According to initial reports , the damage to the archaeological site was less extensive than anticipated , with numerous structures still standing . Following the recapture of the city , Russian de @-@ mining teams began clearing mines planted by ISIL prior to their retreat .

 From the beginning of its history to the first century AD Palmyra was a petty sheikhdom , and by the first century BC a Palmyrene identity began to develop . During the first half of the first century AD , Palmyra incorporated some of the institutions of a Greek city ( polis ) ; the concept of citizenship ( demos ) appears in an inscription , dated to 10 AD , describing the Palmyrenes as a community . In 74 AD , an inscription mentions the city 's boule ( senate ) . The tribal role in Palmyra is debated ; during the first century , four treasurers representing the four tribes seems to have partially controlled the administration but their role became ceremonial by the second century and power rested in the hands of the council . 
 The Palmyrene council consisted of about six hundred members of the local elite ( such as the elders or heads of wealthy families or clans ) , representing the city 's four @-@ quarters . The council , headed by a president , managed civic responsibilities ; it supervised public works ( including the construction of public buildings ) , approved expenditures , collected taxes , and appointed two archons ( lords ) each year . Palmyra 's military was led by strategoi ( generals ) appointed by the council . Roman provincial authority set and approved Palmyra 's tariff structure , but the provincial interference in local government was kept minimal as the empire sought to ensure the continuous success of Palmyrene trade most beneficial to Rome . An imposition of direct provincial administration would have jeopardized Palmyra 's ability to conduct its trading activities in the East , especially in Parthia . 
 With the elevation of Palmyra to a colonia around 213 – 216 , the city ceased being subject to Roman provincial governors and taxes . Palmyra incorporated Roman institutions into its system while keeping many of its former ones . The council remained , and the strategos designated one of two annually @-@ elected magistrates . This <unk> implemented the new colonial constitution , replacing the archons . Palmyra 's political scene changed with the rise of Odaenathus and his family ; an inscription dated to 251 describes Odaenathus ' son Hairan I as " Ras " ( lord ) of Palmyra ( exarch in the Greek section of the inscription ) and another inscription dated to 252 describes Odaenathus with the same title . Odaenathus was probably elected by the council as exarch , which was an unusual title in the Roman empire and was not part of the traditional Palmyrene governance institutions . Whether Odaenathus ' title indicated a military or a priestly position is unknown , but the military role is more likely . By 257 Odaenathus was known as a consularis , possibly the legatus of the province of Phoenice . In 258 Odaenathus began extending his political influence , taking advantage of regional instability caused by Sasanian aggression ; this culminated in the Battle of Edessa , Odaenathus ' royal elevation and mobilization of troops , which made Palmyra a kingdom . 
 The monarchy continued the council and most civic institutions , permitting the election of magistrates until 264 . In the absence of the monarch , the city was administered by a viceroy . Although governors of the eastern Roman provinces under Odaenathus ' control were still appointed by Rome , the king had overall authority . During Zenobia 's rebellion , governors were appointed by the queen . 
 Not all Palmyrenes accepted the dominion of the royal family ; a senator , Septimius <unk> , appears in a later Palmyrene inscription as aiding Aurelian 's armies during the 273 rebellion . After the Roman destruction of the city , Palmyra was ruled directly by Rome , and then by a succession of other rulers , including the Burids and Ayyubids , and subordinate Bedouin chiefs — primarily the Fadl family , who governed for the Mamluks .

 Due to its military character and efficiency in battle , Palmyra was described by Irfan Shahîd as the " Sparta among the cities of the Orient , Arab and other , and even its gods were represented dressed in military uniforms . " Palmyra 's army protected the city and its economy , helping extend Palmyrene authority beyond the city walls and protecting the countryside 's desert trade routes . The city had a substantial military ; Zabdibel commanded a force of 10 @,@ 000 in the third century BC , and Zenobia led an army of 70 @,@ 000 in the Battle of Emesa . Soldiers were recruited from the city and its territories , spanning several thousand square kilometers from the outskirts of Homs to the Euphrates valley . Non @-@ Palmyrene soldiers were also recruited ; a Nabatean cavalryman is recorded in 132 as serving in a Palmyrene unit stationed at Anah . Palmyra 's recruiting system is unknown ; the city might have selected and equipped the troops and the strategoi led , trained and disciplined them . 
 The strategoi were appointed by the council with the approval of Rome . The royal army in the mid 3rd century AD was under the leadership of the monarch aided by generals , and was modeled on the Sasanians in arms and tactics . The Palmyrenes were noted archers . They used infantry while a heavily armored cavalry ( clibanarii ) constituted the main attacking force . Palmyra 's infantry was armed with swords , lances and small round shields ; the clibanarii were fully armored ( including their horses ) , and used heavy spears ( <unk> ) 3 @.@ 65 metres ( 12 @.@ 0 ft ) long without shields . 
 = = = = Relations with Rome = = = = 
 Citing the Palmyrenes ' combat skills in large , sparsely populated areas , the Romans formed a Palmyrene auxilia to serve in the Imperial Roman army . Vespasian reportedly had 8 @,@ 000 Palmyrene archers in Judea , and Trajan established the first Palmyrene <unk> in 116 ( a camel cavalry unit , Ala I Ulpia <unk> <unk> ) . Palmyrene units were deployed throughout the Roman Empire , serving in Dacia late in Hadrian 's reign , and at El Kantara in Numidia and Moesia under Antoninus Pius . During the late second century Rome formed the Cohors XX <unk> , which was stationed in Dura @-@ Europos . 
 = = Religion = = 
 Palmyra 's gods were primarily part of the northwestern Semitic pantheon , with the addition of gods from the Mesopotamian and Arab pantheons . The city 's chief pre @-@ Hellenistic deity was called Bol , an abbreviation of Baal ( a northwestern Semitic honorific ) . The Babylonian cult of Bel @-@ Marduk influenced the Palmyrene religion and by 217 BC the chief deity 's name was changed to Bel . This did not indicate the replacing of the northwestern Semitic Bol with a Mesopotamian deity , but was a mere change in the name . 
 Second in importance after the supreme deity , were over sixty ancestral gods of the Palmyrene clans . Palmyra had unique deities , such as the god of justice and Efqa 's guardian <unk> , the sun god Malakbel , and the moon god Aglibol . Palmyrenes worshiped regional deities , including the greater Levantine gods Astarte , Baal @-@ hamon , Baalshamin and Atargatis ; the Babylonian gods Nabu and Nergal , and the Arab <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Al @-@ lāt . 
 The deities worshiped in the countryside were depicted as camel or horse riders and bore Arab names . The nature of those deities is uncertain as only names are known , most importantly <unk> . The Palmyrene pantheon included <unk> ( some were given the designation " Gad " ) , a group of lesser deities popular in the countryside , who were similar to the Arab jinn and the Roman genius . <unk> were believed to have the appearance and behavior of humans , similar to Arab jinn . Unlike jinn , however , the <unk> could not possess or injure humans . Their role was similar to the Roman genius : tutelary deities who guarded individuals and their caravans , cattle and villages . 
 Although the Palmyrenes worshiped their deities as individuals , some were associated with other gods . Bel had Astarte @-@ <unk> as his consort , and formed a triple deity with Aglibol and <unk> ( who became a sun god in his association with Bel ) . Malakbel was part of many associations , pairing with Gad <unk> and Aglibol , and forming a triple deity with Baalshamin and Aglibol . Palmyra hosted an <unk> ( spring festival ) each Nisan . Each of the city 's four @-@ quarters had a sanctuary for a deity considered ancestral to the resident tribe ; Malakbel and Aglibol 's sanctuary was in the <unk> quarter . The Baalshamin sanctuary was in the Ma <unk> quarter , the <unk> sanctuary in the <unk> quarter , and the Atargatis sanctuary in the fourth tribe 's quarter . 
 Palmyra 's paganism was replaced with Christianity as the religion spread across the Roman Empire , and a bishop was reported in the city by 325 . Although most temples became churches , the Temple of Al @-@ lāt was destroyed in 385 at the order of Maternus <unk> ( the eastern praetorian prefect ) . After the Muslim conquest in 634 Islam gradually replaced Christianity , and the last known bishop of Palmyra was consecrated in 818 . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Palmyra 's economy before and at the beginning of the Roman period was based on agriculture , pastoralism , trade , and serving as a rest station for the caravans which sporadically crossed the desert . By the end of the first century BC , the city had a mixed economy based on agriculture , pastoralism , taxation , and , most importantly , the caravan trade . 
 Taxation was an important source of revenue for the Palmyrene government . <unk> paid taxes in the building known as the Tariff Court , where a tax law dating to 137 AD was exhibited . The law regulated the tariffs paid by the merchants for goods sold at the internal market or exported from the city . <unk> Andrew M. Smith II suggests most land in Palmyra was owned by the city , which collected grazing taxes . The oasis had about 1 @,@ 000 hectares ( 2 @,@ 500 acres ) of irrigable land , which surrounded the city . The Palmyrenes constructed an extensive irrigation system in the northern mountains that consisted of reservoirs and channels to capture and store the occasional rainfall . The countryside was intensively planted with olive , fig , pistachio and barley . However , agriculture could not support the population and food was imported . 
 After Palmyra 's destruction in 273 , it became a market for villagers and nomads from the surrounding area . The city regained some of its prosperity during the Umayyad era , indicated by the discovery of a large Umayyad souq in the colonnaded street . Palmyra was a minor trading center until the Timurid destruction in 1400 , which reduced it to a settlement on the desert border whose inhabitants herded and cultivated small plots for vegetables and corn . 
 = = = Commerce = = = 
 During the first centuries AD , Palmyra 's main trade route ran east to the Euphrates , where it connected to the Silk Road . The route then ran south along the river toward the port of Charax <unk> on the Persian Gulf , where Palmyrene ships traveled back and forth to India . Goods were imported from India , China and Transoxiana , and exported west to Emesa ( or Antioch ) then the Mediterranean ports , from which they were distributed throughout the Roman Empire . In addition to the usual route some Palmyrene merchants used the Red Sea , probably as a result of the Roman – Parthian Wars . Goods were carried overland from the seaports to a Nile port , and then taken to the Egyptian Mediterranean ports for export . Inscriptions attesting a Palmyrene presence in Egypt date to the reign of Hadrian . 
 Since Palmyra was not on the Silk Road ( which followed the Euphrates ) , the Palmyrenes secured the desert route passing their city . They connected it to the Euphrates valley , providing water and shelter . The Palmyrene route was used almost exclusively by the city 's merchants , who maintained a presence in many cities , including Dura @-@ Europos in 33 BC , Babylon by 19 AD , Seleucia by 24 AD , Dendera , <unk> , Bahrain , the Indus River Delta , Merv and Rome . 
 The caravan trade depended on patrons and merchants . Patrons owned the land on which the caravan animals were raised , providing animals and guards for the merchants . The lands were located in the numerous villages of the Palmyrene countryside . Although merchants used the patrons to conduct business , their roles often overlapped and a patron would sometimes lead a caravan . Commerce made Palmyra and its merchants among the wealthiest in the region . Some caravans were financed by a single merchant , such as Male ' Agrippa ( who financed Hadrian 's visit in 129 and the 139 rebuilding of the Temple of Bel ) . The primary income @-@ generating trade good was silk , which was exported from the East to the West . Other exported goods included jade , muslin , spices , ebony , ivory and precious stones . For its domestic market Palmyra imported variety of goods including slaves , prostitutes , olive oil , dyed goods , myrrh and perfume .

 During the Middle Ages Palmyra was largely forgotten by the West , although it was visited by travelers such as Pietro Della Valle ( between 1616 and 1625 ) , Jean @-@ Baptiste Tavernier ( in 1638 ) and many Swedish and German explorers . In 1678 a group of English merchants visited the city , and its first scholarly description appeared in a 1705 book by Abednego Seller . In 1751 , an expedition led by Robert Wood and James Dawkins studied Palmyra 's architecture ; visits by travelers and antiquarians continued , including one made by Lady Hester Stanhope in 1813 . In 1881 , the " Palmyrene Tariff " , an inscribed stone slab from 137 AD in Greek and Palmyrene detailing import and export taxation , was discovered by prince <unk> @-@ Lazarev in the Tariff Court . It has been described as " one of the most important single items of evidence for the economic life of any part of the Roman Empire " . In 1901 , the slab was gifted by the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II to the Russian Tsar and is now in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg . 
 Palmyra 's first excavations were conducted in 1902 by Otto <unk> and in 1917 by Theodor Wiegand . In 1929 , French general director of antiquities of Syria and Lebanon Henri Arnold Seyrig began large @-@ scale excavation of the site ; interrupted by World War II , it resumed soon after the war 's end . Seyrig started with the Temple of Bel in 1929 and between 1939 and 1940 he excavated the Agora . Daniel Schlumberger conducted excavations in the Palmyrene northwest countryside in 1934 and 1935 where he studied different local sanctuaries in the Palmyrene villages . From 1954 to 1956 , a Swiss expedition organized by UNESCO excavated the Temple of Baalshamin . Since 1958 , the site has been excavated by the Syrian Directorate @-@ General of Antiquities , and Polish expeditions led by many archaeologists including Kazimierz Michałowski ( until 1980 ) and Michael Gawlikowski ( until 2011 ) . 
 The Polish expedition concentrated its work in the Camp of Diocletian while the Syrian Directorate @-@ General of Antiquities excavated the Temple of Nabu . Most of the <unk> were excavated jointly by the Polish expedition and the Syrian Directorate , while the area of Efqa was excavated by Jean Starcky and Jafar al @-@ Hassani . The Temple of Baal @-@ hamon was discovered by Robert du Mesnil du Buisson in the 1970s . The Palmyrene irrigation system was discovered in 2008 by Jørgen Christian Meyer who researched the Palmyrene countryside through ground inspections and satellite images . Most of Palmyra still remains unexplored especially the residential quarters in the north and south while the necropolis has been thoroughly excavated by the Directorate and the Polish expedition . Excavation expeditions left Palmyra in 2011 due to the Syrian Civil War . 
 In 1980 , the historic site including the necropolis outside the walls was declared a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO . In November 2010 the Austrian media manager Helmut Thoma admitted looting a Palmyrene grave in 1980 , stealing architectural pieces for his home ; German and Austrian archaeologists protested against the theft . 
 = = Destruction by ISIL = = 
 According to eyewitnesses , on 23 May 2015 the militants destroyed the Lion of Al @-@ lāt and other statues . The militant group destroyed the Temple of Baalshamin on 23 August 2015 according to <unk> and activists , while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that the destruction took place one month earlier . 
 The Syrian Observatory announced that on 30 August 2015 , ISIL destroyed the Temple of Bel ; according to eyewitnesses , only the exterior walls remain . On 31 August 2015 , the United Nations confirmed the temple was destroyed . It became known on 4 September 2015 that ISIL had destroyed three of the best preserved tower tombs including the Tower of <unk> . On 5 October 2015 , news media reported ISIL is destroying buildings with no religious meaning , including the Arch of Triumph . 
 In response to the destruction , on 21 October 2015 , Creative Commons started an online repository of three @-@ dimensional images published into the public domain to digitally reconstruct Palmyra .

 " Nobody Sees " was recorded by Powderfinger for their 2007 album Dream Days at the Hotel Existence at Sunset Sound Studio , Los Angeles , California , in early 2007 with producer Rob Schnapf . In an interview with Jay and the Doctor on Triple J in November 2007 , Fanning noted that the song is a " bookend " to Powderfinger 's early breakout single " Pick You Up " from Double Allergic . He goes on to note that " It 's ' who 's going to pick you up now ? ' . Cause I 'm not doing it any more . " Fanning also noted that he considers the song a " spacey ballad " . Though the band had previously released songs featuring piano , they had decided for this album to record with session pianist Benmont Tench , who previously had played for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers , who were one of the inspirations of the album . This was in contrast to previous efforts where piano parts had been performed by Fanning or local Australian pianists . Despite Tench 's performance on the song , Fanning appears in the music video as playing piano .

Herald Sun HiT reviewer Cameron Adams agreed , also commenting that the song was an excellent reminder " of Fanning ’ s prowess as a rock vocalist " . 
 Mess + Noise reviewer Andrew <unk> notes that " Nobody Sees " is validated by Dream Days at the Hotel Existence 's controversial track " Black Tears " , stating that it " would otherwise seem like the usual lovelorn crap [ but ] can ’ t help but take on a different meaning in the shadow of " Black Tears " .

 = Themes in Avatar = 
 The 2009 American science fiction film Avatar has earned widespread success , becoming the highest @-@ grossing film in history . The blockbuster has provoked vigorous discussion of a wide variety of cultural , social , political , and religious themes identified by critics and commentators , and the film 's writer and director James Cameron has responded that he hoped to create an emotional reaction and to provoke public conversation about these topics . The broad range of Avatar 's intentional or perceived themes has prompted reviewers to call it " an all @-@ purpose allegory " and " the season 's ideological Rorschach blot " . One reporter even suggested that the politically charged <unk> has been " misplaced " : reviewers should have seized on the opportunity to take " a break from their usual fodder of public policy and foreign relations " rather than making an ideological battlefield of this " popcorn epic " . 
 Discussion has centered on such themes as the conflict between modern human and nature , and the film 's treatment of imperialism , racism , militarism and patriotism , corporate greed , property rights , spirituality and religion . Commentators have debated whether the film 's treatment of the human aggression against the native Na 'vi is a message of support for indigenous peoples today , or is , instead , a tired retelling of the racist myth of the noble savage . Right @-@ wing critics accused Cameron of pushing an " anti @-@ American " message in the film 's depiction of a private military contractor that used ex @-@ Marines to attack the natives , while Cameron and others argued that it is pro @-@ American to question the propriety of the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . The visual similarity between the destruction of the World Trade Center and the felling of Home Tree in the film caused some filmgoers to further identify with the Na 'vi and to identify the human military contractors as terrorists . Critics asked whether this comparison was intended to encourage audiences to empathize with the position of Muslims under military occupation today . 
 Much discussion has concerned the film 's treatment of environmental protection and the parallels to , for example , the destruction of rainforests , mountaintop removal for mining and evictions from homes for development . The title of the film and various visual and story elements provoked discussion of the film 's use of the iconography of Hinduism , which Cameron confirmed had inspired him . Christians , including the Vatican , worried that the film promotes pantheism over Christian beliefs , while others instead thought that it sympathetically explores biblical concepts . Other critics either praised the film 's spiritual elements or found them hackneyed . 
 = = Political themes = = 
 = = = Imperialism = = = 
 Avatar describes the battle by an indigenous people , the Na 'vi of Pandora , against the oppression of alien humans . Director James Cameron acknowledged that the film is " certainly about imperialism in the sense that the way human history has always worked is that people with more military or technological might tend to supplant or destroy people who are weaker , usually for their resources . " Critics agreed that the film is " a clear message about dominant , aggressive cultures subjugating a native population in a quest for resources or riches . " George Monbiot , writing in The Guardian , asserted that conservative criticism of Avatar is a reaction to what he called the film 's " chilling metaphor " for the European " genocides in the Americas " , which " massively enriched " Europe . Cameron told National Public Radio that references to the colonial period are in the film " by design " . Adam Cohen of The New York Times compared the struggle of the Na 'vi with " a 22nd @-@ century version of the American colonists vs. the British , India vs. the British Raj , or Latin America vs. United Fruit . " 
 Saritha Prabhu , an Indian @-@ born columnist for The Tennessean , wrote about the parallels between the plot and how " Western power colonizes and invades the indigenous people ( native Americans , Eastern countries , you substitute the names ) , sees the natives as primitives / savages / uncivilized , is unable or unwilling to see the merits in a civilization that has been around longer , loots the weaker power , all while thinking it is doing a favor to the poor natives . " David Brooks , in The New York Times , criticized what he saw as the " White Messiah complex " in the film , whereby the Na 'vi " can either have their history shaped by cruel imperialists or benevolent ones , but either way , they are going to be supporting actors in our journey to self @-@ admiration . " Others disagree : " First off , [ Jake is ] handicapped . Second off , he ultimately becomes one of [ the Na 'vi ] and wins their way . " 
 Many commentators saw the film as a message of support for the struggles of native peoples today . Evo Morales , the first indigenous president of Bolivia , praised Avatar for its " profound show of resistance to capitalism and the struggle for the defense of nature " . Others compared the human invaders with " NATO in Iraq or Israel in Palestine " , and considered it reassuring that " when the Na 'vi clans are united , and a sincere prayer is offered , the ... ' primitive savages ' win the war . " Palestinian activists painted themselves blue and dressed like the Na 'vi during their weekly protest in the village of <unk> against Israel 's separation barrier . Other Arab writers , however , noted that " for Palestinians , Avatar is rather a reaffirmation and confirmation of the claims about their incapability to lead themselves and build their own future . " On the other hand , Forbes columnist Reihan Salam criticized the vilification of capitalism in the film , asserting that it represents a more noble and heroic way of life than that led by the Na 'vi , because it " give [ s ] everyone an opportunity to learn , discover , and explore , and to change the world around us . " 
 = = = Militarism = = = 
 Cameron stated that Avatar is " very much a political film " and added : " This movie reflects that we are living through war . There are boots on the ground , troops who I personally believe were sent there under false pretenses , so I hope this will be part of opening our eyes . " He confirmed that " the Iraq stuff and the Vietnam stuff is there by design " , adding that he did not think that the film was anti @-@ military . Critic Charles <unk> in Swans magazine remarked , however , that the realism of the suggested parallel with wars in Iraq , Iran , and Afghanistan " doesn 't quite jell " because the natives are " peace @-@ loving and empathetic " . 
 Cameron said that Americans have a " moral responsibility " to understand the impact of their country 's recent military campaigns . Commenting on the term " shock and awe " in the film , Cameron said : " We know what it feels like to launch the missiles . We don 't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil , not in America . " Christian <unk> of Crosswalk.com noted that , " in describing the military assault on Pandora , Cameron cribs terminology from the ongoing war on terrorism and puts it in the mouths of the film 's villains ... as they ' fight terror with terror ' . Cameron 's sympathies , and the movie 's , clearly are with the Na 'vi — and against the military and corporate men . " A columnist in the Russian newspaper <unk> traced Avatar 's popularity to its giving the audience a chance to make a moral choice between good and evil and , by emotionally siding with Jake 's treason , to relieve " us the scoundrels " of our collective guilt for the cruel and unjust world that we have created . Armond White of New York Press dismissed the film as " essentially a sentimental cartoon with a pacifist , naturalist message " that uses villainous Americans to misrepresent the facts of the military , capitalism , and imperialism . Answering critiques of the film as insulting to the U.S. military , a piece in the Los Angeles Times asserted that " if any U.S. forces that ever existed were being insulted , it was the ones who fought under George Armstrong Custer , not David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal . " Other reviews saw Avatar as " the bubbling up of our military subconscious ... the wish to be free of all the paperwork and risk aversion of the modern Army — much more fun to fly , unarmored , on a winged beast . " 
 A critic writing in Le Monde opined that , contrary to the perceived pacifism of Avatar , the film justifies war in the response to attack by the film 's positive characters , particularly the American hero who encourages the Na 'vi to " follow him into battle . ... Every war , even those that seem the most insane [ are justified as being ] for the ' right reasons ' . " Ann Marlowe of Forbes saw the film as both pro- and anti @-@ military , " a metaphor for the networked military " . 
 = = = Anti @-@ Americanism = = = 
 Many reviewers perceived an anti @-@ American message in the film , equating RDA 's private security force to American soldiers . Commentator Glenn Beck on his radio show said that Avatar was " an anti ‑ U.S. human thing " . Russell D. Moore in The Christian Post stated that , " If you can get a theater full of people in Kentucky to stand and applaud the defeat of their country in war , then you 've got some amazing special effects " and criticized Cameron for what he saw as an <unk> depiction of the American military as " pure evil " . John Podhoretz of The Weekly Standard argued that Avatar revealed " hatred of the military and American institutions and the notion that to be human is just way uncool . " One review called Avatar the " liberal tell " of " a thinly disguised , heavy @-@ handed and simplistic sci @-@ fi fantasy / allegory critical of America from our founding straight through to the Iraq War . " Charles <unk> of The Stranger commented that with the release of the film " the American culture industry exports an anti @-@ American spectacle to an anti @-@ American world . " Debbie <unk> likewise dismissed Avatar as " cinema for the hate America crowd " . 
 Cameron argued that " the film is definitely not anti @-@ American " and that " part of being an American is having the freedom to have dissenting ideas . " A critic for MTV concurred that " it 'd take a great leap of logic to tag ' Avatar ' as anti @-@ American or anti @-@ capitalist . " Ann Marlowe called the film " the most neo @-@ con movie ever made " for its " deeply conservative , pro @-@ American message " . But Cameron admitted to some ambiguity on the issue , agreeing that " the bad guys could be America in this movie , or the good guys could be America in this movie , depending on your perspective " , and stated that Avatar 's defeat at the Academy Awards might have been due to the perceived anti @-@ U.S. theme in it . 
 The destruction of the Na 'vi habitat Hometree reminded commentators of the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center , one calling it a " tacky metaphor " and others criticizing Cameron for his " audacious willingness to question the sacred trauma of 9 / 11 " . Cameron said that he was " surprised at how much it did look like September 11 " , but added that he did not think that it was necessarily a bad thing . A French critic wrote : " How can one not see the analogy with the collapse of the towers of the World Trade Center ? Then , after that spectacular scene , all is justified [ for the unified ] indigenous peoples ( the allied forces ) ... to kill those who [ are ] just like terrorists . " Another writer noted that " the U.S. ' stand @-@ ins are the perpetrators , and not the victims " and described this reversal as " the movie ’ s most seditious act " . 
 = = Social and cultural themes = = 
 = = = Civilization and race = = = 
 Commentators around the world sought to interpret the relationship between the Na 'vi and humans in the film , mostly agreeing with Maxim Osipov , who wrote in the Hindustan Times and The Sydney Morning Herald : " The ' civilised humans ' turn out as primitive , jaded and increasingly greedy , cynical , and brutal — traits only amplified by their machinery — while the ' monkey aliens ' emerge as noble , kind , wise , sensitive and humane . We , along with the Avatar hero , are now faced with an uncomfortable yet irresistible choice between the two races and the two worldviews . " Osipov wrote that it was inevitable that the audience , like the film 's hero , Jake , would find that the Na 'vi 's culture was really the more civilized of the two , exemplifying " the qualities of kindness , gratitude , regard for the elder , self @-@ sacrifice , respect for all life and ultimately humble dependence on a higher intelligence behind nature . " Echoing this analysis , psychologist Jeffery Fine in The Miami Herald urged " every man , woman and child " to see the film and wake up to its message by making the right choice between commercial materialism , which is " steamrolling our soul and consciousness " , and reconnection with all life as " the only ... promise of survival " for humanity . Similarly , an Angolan critic saw the film as a message of hope , writing , " With this union of humans and aliens comes a feeling that something better exists in the universe : the respect for life . " Cameron confirmed that " the Na 'vi represent the better aspects of human nature , and the human characters in the film demonstrate the more venal aspects of human nature . " 
 Conversely , David Brooks of The New York Times opined that Avatar creates " a sort of two @-@ edged cultural imperialism " , an offensive cultural stereotype that white people are rationalist and technocratic while colonial victims are spiritual and athletic and that illiteracy is the path to grace . A review in the Irish Independent found the film to contrast a " mix of New Age environmentalism and the myth of the Noble Savage " with the corruption of the " civilized " white man . Reihan Salam , writing in Forbes , viewed it as ironic that " Cameron has made a dazzling , gorgeous indictment of the kind of society that produces James Camerons . " 
 Many critics saw racist undertones in the film 's treatment of the indigenous Na 'vi , seeing it as " a fantasy about race told from the point of view of white people " , which reinforces " the White Messiah fable " , in which the white hero saves helpless primitive natives , who are thus reduced to servicing his ambitions and proving his heroism . Other reviews called Avatar an offensive assumption that <unk> need the White Messiah to lead their crusades , and " a self @-@ loathing racist screed " due to the fact that all the " human " roles in the film are played by white actors and all the Na 'vi characters by African @-@ American or Native American actors . 
 Māori academic <unk> <unk> agreed that the film portrays indigenous people as being simplistic and unable to defend themselves without the help from " the white guys and the neo @-@ liberals . " Another author remarked that while the white man will fix the destruction , he will never feel guilty , even though he is directly responsible for the destruction . " Likewise , Josef Joffe , publisher @-@ editor of Die Zeit in Germany , said the film perpetuates the myth of the " noble savage " and has " a condescending , yes , even racist message . Cameron bows to the noble savages . However , he reduces them to dependents . " Slavoj Žižek argued that " the film enables us to practise a typical ideological division : sympathising with the idealised aborigines while rejecting their actual struggle . " The Irish Times carried the comment that " despite all the thematic elements from Hinduism , one thing truly original is the good old American ego . Given its Hollywood origins , the script has remained faithful to the inherent superiority complex , and has predictably bestowed the honor of the ' avatar ' not on the movie ’ s native Na ’ vis , but on a white American marine . " Similarly , positing that " the only good humans [ in the film ] are dead — or rather , resurrected as ' good Navi ' " , a writer in The Jerusalem Post thought that the film was inadvertently promoting supremacy of one race over another . 
 On the Charlie Rose talk show , Cameron acknowledged parallels with idea of the " noble savage " , but argued : " When indigenous populations who are at a bow and arrow level are met with technological superior forces , [ if ] somebody doesn 't help them , they lose . So we are not talking about a racial group within an existing population fighting for their rights . " Cameron rejected claims that the film is racist , asserting that Avatar is about respecting others ' differences . Adam Cohen of The New York Times felt similarly , writing that the Na 'vi greeting " I see you " contrasts with the oppression of , and even genocide against , those who we fail to accept for what they are , citing Jewish ghettos and the Soviet gulags as examples . 
 = = = Environment and property = = = 
 Avatar has been called " without a doubt the most epic piece of environmental advocacy ever captured on celluloid .... The film hits all the important environmental talking @-@ points — virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation , indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world , a planet which functions as a collective , interconnected Gaia @-@ istic organism , and evil corporate interests that are trying to destroy it all . " Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film 's environmental message , saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world . He said that he created Pandora as " a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like , before we started to pave it and build malls , and shopping centers . So it 's really an evocation of the world we used to have . " He told Charlie Rose that " we are going to go through a lot of pain and heartache if we don 't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature . " Interviewed by Terry Gross of National Public Radio , he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement : " [ Avatar ] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye . It 's just human nature that if we can take it , we will . And sometimes we do it in a very naked and imperialistic way , and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization — but it 's basically the same thing . A sense of entitlement . And we can 't just go on in this unsustainable way , just taking what we want and not giving back . " An article in the Belgium paper De Standaard agreed : " It 's about the brutality of man , who shamelessly takes what isn 't his . " 
 Commentators connected the film 's story to the endangerment of biodiversity in the Amazon rainforests of Brazil by dam construction , logging , mining , and clearing for agriculture . A Newsweek piece commented on the destruction of Home Tree as resembling the rampant tree @-@ felling in Tibet , while another article compared the film 's depiction of destructive corporate mining for unobtanium in the Na 'vi lands with the mining and milling of uranium near the Navajo reservation in New Mexico . Other critics , however , dismissed Avatar 's pro @-@ environmental stance as inconsistent . Armond White remarked that , " Cameron ’ s really into the <unk> @-@ <unk> factor : destructive combat and the deployment of technological force . ... Cameron fashionably denounces the same economic and military system that make his technological extravaganza possible . It ’ s like condemning NASA — yet joyriding on the Mars Exploration Rover . " Another author called the film " socialism @-@ disguised @-@ as @-@ nonsense <unk> stuff " and argued that the very process of creation and promotion of Avatar emitted enough carbon to undermine the film 's ecological message . Similarly , an article in National Review concluded that by resorting to technology for educating viewers of the technology endangered world of Pandora , the film " showcases the contradictions of organic liberalism . " 
 Stating that such a conservative criticism of his film 's " strong environmental anti @-@ war themes " was not unexpected , Cameron stressed that he was " interested in saving the world that my children are going to inhabit " , encouraged everyone to be a " tree hugger " , and urged that we " make a fairly rapid transition to alternate energy . " The film and Cameron 's environmental activism caught the attention of the 8 @,@ 000 @-@ strong <unk> <unk> tribe from Orissa , eastern India . They appealed to him to help them stop a mining company from opening a bauxite open @-@ cast mine , on their sacred <unk> mountain , in an advertisement in Variety that read : " Avatar is fantasy ... and real . The <unk> <unk> ... are struggling to defend their land against a mining company hell @-@ bent on destroying their sacred mountain . Please help .... " Similarly , a coalition of over fifty environmental and aboriginal organizations of Canada ran a full @-@ page ad in the special Oscar edition of Variety likening their fight against Canada 's Alberta oilsands to the Na 'vi insurgence , — a comparison the mining and oil companies objected to . Cameron was awarded the inaugural Temecula Environment Award for Outstanding Social Responsibility in Media by three environmentalist groups for portrayal of environmental struggles that they compared with their own . 
 The destruction of the Na 'vi habitat to make way for mining operations has also evoked parallels with the oppressive policies of some states often involving forcible evictions related to development . David Boaz of the libertarian Cato Institute wrote in Los Angeles Times that the film 's essential conflict is a battle over property rights , " the foundation of the free market and indeed of civilization . " Melinda Liu found this storyline reminiscent of the policies of the authorities in China , where 30 million citizens have been evicted in the course of a three @-@ decade long development boom . An article in the Global Times , published by the Chinese Communist Party 's official newspaper People 's Daily , called the film 's plot " the spitting image of the violent demolition in our everyday life . ... [ F ] <unk> the violent demolition conducted by <unk> but instigated by real estate developers , some ordinary people have wept or burned themselves desperately , while most continue to bear unfairness in silence . " Others saw similar links to the displacement of tribes in the Amazon basin and the forcible demolition of private houses in a Moscow suburb . 
 = = Religion and spirituality = = 
 David Quinn of the Irish Independent wrote that the spirituality depicted " goes some way towards explaining the film 's gigantic popularity , and that is the fact that Avatar is essentially a religious film , even if Cameron might not have intended it as such . " At the same time , Jonah Goldberg of National Review Online objected to what he saw in the film reviews as " the norm to speak glowingly of spirituality but derisively of traditional religion . " 
 James Cameron has said that he " tried to make a film that would touch people 's spirituality across the broad spectrum . " He also stated that one of the film 's philosophical underpinnings is that " the Na 'vi represent that sort of aspirational part of ourselves that wants to be better , that wants to respect nature , while the humans in the film represent the more venal versions of ourselves , the banality of evil that comes with corporate decisions that are made out of remove of the consequences . " Film director John Boorman saw a similar dichotomy as a key factor contributing to its success : " Perhaps the key is the marine in the wheelchair . He is disabled , but Mr Cameron and technology can transport him into the body of a beautiful , athletic , sexual , being . After all , we are all disabled in one way or another ; inadequate , old , broken , earthbound . Pandora is a kind of heaven where we can be resurrected and connected instead of disconnected and alone . " 
 = = = Religions and mythology = = = 
 Reviewers suggested that the film draws upon many existing religious and mythological motifs . Vern Barnet of the Charlotte Observer opined that Avatar poses a great question of faith — should the creation be seen and governed hierarchically , from above , or ecologically , through mutual interdependence ? He also noted that the film borrows concepts from other religions and compared its Tree of Souls with the Norse story of the tree Yggdrasil , also called axis mundi or the center of the world , whose destruction signals the collapse of the universe . Malinda Liu in Newsweek likened the Na 'vi respect for life and belief in reincarnation with Tibetan religious beliefs and practices , but Reihan Salam of Forbes called the species " perhaps the most sanctimonious humanoids ever portrayed on film . " 
 A Bolivian writer defined " avatar " as " something born without human intervention , without intercourse , without sin " , comparing it to the birth of Jesus Christ , Krishna , Manco Capac , and Mama <unk> and drew parallels between the deity Eywa of Pandora and the goddess <unk> worshiped by the indigenous people of the Andes . Another suggested that the world of Pandora mirrored the Garden of Eden . A writer for Religion Dispatches countered that Avatar " begs , borrows , and steals from a variety of longstanding human stories , puts them through the grinder , and comes up with something new . " Another commentator called Avatar " a new version of the Garden of Eden syndrome " pointing to what she viewed as phonetic and conceptual similarities of the film 's terminology with that of the Book of Genesis . 
 = = = Parallels with Hinduism = = = 
 The Times of India suggested Avatar was a treatise on <unk> " for <unk> and Indian philosophy enthusiasts " , starting from the very word Avatar itself . A Houston Chronicle piece critiqued the film in terms of the ancient Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata , commenting on the Na 'vi visual similarity with Rama and Krishna — avatars central to the respective epics and traditionally depicted with blue skin , black hair , and a tilak mark on the forehead . Another critic found that elements of the film 's plot resembled such teachings and concepts of Hinduism as reincarnation of the soul , ecological consciousness , and incarnations of deities on Earth , commending Avatar and its director for " raising the global stature of Hinduism ... in months " , while criticizing them for substantiating the western reluctance to accept anything oriental in its pristine form . 
 Cameron calls the connection a " subconscious " reference : " I have just loved ... the mythology , the entire Hindu pantheon , seems so rich and vivid . " He continued , " I didn 't want to reference the Hindu religion so closely , but the subconscious association was interesting , and I hope I haven 't offended anyone in doing so . " He has stated that he was familiar with a lot of beliefs of the Hindu religion and found it " quite fascinating " . 
 Answering a question from Time magazine in 2007 , " What is an Avatar anyway ? " James Cameron replied , " It 's an incarnation of one of the Hindu gods taking a flesh form . In this film what that means is that the human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human 's intelligence into a remotely located body , a biological body . " In 2010 , Cameron confirmed the meaning of the title to the Times of India : " Of course , that was the significance in the film , although the characters are not divine beings . But the idea was that they take flesh in another body . " 
 Following the film 's release , reviewers focused on Cameron 's choice of the religious Sanskrit term for the film 's title . A reviewer in the Irish Times traced the term to the ten incarnations of Vishnu . Another writer for The Hindu concluded that by using the " loaded Sanskrit word " Cameron indicated the possibility that an encounter with an emotionally superior — but technologically inferior — form of alien may in the future become a next step in human evolution — provided we will learn to integrate and change , rather than conquer and destroy . 
 Maxim Osipov of ISKCON argued in The Sydney Morning Herald that " Avatar " is a " downright misnomer " for the film because " the movie reverses the very concept [ that ] the term ' avatar ' — literally , in Sanskrit , ' descent ' — is based on . So much for a descending ' avatar ' , Jake becomes a refugee among the aborigines . " Vern Barnet in Charlotte Observer likewise thought that the title insults traditional Hindu usage of the term since it is a human , not a god , who descends in the film . However , Rishi <unk> , Houston coordinator of the Hindu American Foundation , stated that while there are certain sacred terms that would offend Hindus if used improperly , ' avatar ' is not one of them . Texas @-@ based filmmaker Ashok Rao added that ' avatar ' does not always mean a representative of God on Earth , but simply one being in another form — especially in literature , moviemaking , poetry and other forms of art . 
 Explaining the choice of the color blue for the Na 'vi , Cameron said " I just like blue . It 's a good color ... plus , there 's a connection to the Hindu deities , which I like conceptually . " Commentators agreed that the blue skin of the Na 'vi , described in a New Yorker article as " Vishnu @-@ blue " , " instantly and metaphorically " relates the film 's protagonist to such avatars of Vishnu as Rama and Krishna . An article in the San Francisco Examiner described an 18th @-@ century Indian painting of Vishnu and his consort <unk> riding the great mythical bird Garuda as " Avatar prequel " due to its resemblance with the film 's scene in which the hero 's blue @-@ skinned avatar flies a gigantic raptor . <unk> Q. <unk> of The Daily Beast likened the hero and his Na 'vi mate Neytiri to images of Shiva and Durga . 
 Discussing explicit or implicit similarities between the film and the philosophy of Hinduism , reviewers suggested that , just as Hindu gods , particularly Vishnu , become avatars to save the order of the universe , the film ’ s avatar must descend to avert impending ultimate doom , effected by a rapacious greed that leads to destroying the world of nature and other civilizations . Maxim Osipov observed that the film 's philosophical message was consistent overall with the Bhagavad Gita , a key scripture of Hinduism , in defining what constitutes real culture and civilization . 
 Critics saw an " undeniably " Hindu connection between the film 's story and the Vedic teaching of reverence for the whole universe , as well as the yogic practice of inhabiting a distant body by one ’ s consciousness and compared the film 's love scene to tantric practices . Another linked the Na 'vi earth goddess Eywa to the concept of Brahman as the ground of being described in Vedanta and Upanishads and likened the Na 'vi ability to connect to Eywa with the realization of Atman . One commentator noted the parallel between the Na 'vi greeting " I see you " and the ancient Hindu greeting " Namaste " , which signifies perceiving and adoring the divinity within others . Others commented on Avatar 's adaptation of the Hindu teaching of reincarnation , — a concept , which another author felt was more accurately applicable to ordinary human beings that are " a step or two away from exotic animals " than to deities . 
 Writing for the Ukrainian Day newspaper , Maxim <unk> drew detailed analogies between Avatar 's plot and elements of the ancient Bhagavata Purana narrative of Krishna , including the heroine Radha , the <unk> tribe and their habitat the <unk> forest , the hovering Govardhan mountain , and the mystical rock <unk> . He also opined that this resemblance may account for " Avatar blues " — a sense of loss experienced by members of the audience at the conclusion of the film . 
 = = = <unk> vs. Christianity = = = 
 Some Christian writers worried that Avatar promotes pantheism and nature worship . A critic for L ’ <unk> Romano of the Holy See wrote that the film " shows a spiritualism linked to the worship of nature , a fashionable pantheism in which creator and creation are mixed up . " Likewise , Vatican Radio argued that the film " cleverly winks at all those pseudo @-@ doctrines that turn ecology into the religion of the millennium . Nature is no longer a creation to defend , but a divinity to worship . " According to Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi , these reviews reflect the Pope 's views on neopaganism , or confusing nature and spirituality . On the other hand , disagreeing with the Vatican 's characterization of Avatar as pagan , a writer in the National Catholic Reporter urged Christian critics to see the film in the historical context of " Christianity 's complicity in the conquest of the Americas " instead . 
 Ross Douthat , a conservative columnist of The New York Times , called Avatar " the Gospel According to James " and " Cameron 's long apologia for pantheism [ which ] has been Hollywood 's religion of choice for a generation now . " In The Weekly Standard , John Podhoretz criticized the film 's " mindless worship of a nature @-@ loving tribe and the tribe 's adorable pagan rituals . " Christian critic David <unk> disputed that " the danger to moviegoers is that Avatar presents the Na 'vi culture on Pandora as morally superior to life on Earth . If you love the philosophy and culture of the Na 'vi too much , you will be led into evil rather than away from it . " <unk> further added : " Cameron has done a masterful job in manipulating the emotions of his audience in Avatar . He created a world where it looks good and noble to live in a tree and hunt for your food daily with a bow and arrow . ... Cameron said , ' Avatar asks us to see that everything is connected , all human beings to each other , and us to the Earth . ' This is a clear statement of religious belief . This is pantheism . It is not Christianity . " 
 Other Christian critics wrote that Avatar has " an abhorrent New Age , pagan , anti @-@ capitalist worldview that promotes goddess worship and the destruction of the human race " and suggested that Christian viewers interpret the film as a reminder of Jesus Christ as " the True Avatar " . Some of them also suspected Avatar of subversive retelling of the biblical Exodus , by which Cameron " invites us to look at the Bible from the side of Canaanites . " Conversely , other commentators concluded that the film promotes theism or panentheism rather than pantheism , arguing that the hero " does not pray to a tree , but through a tree to the deity whom he addresses personally " and , unlike in pantheism , " the film 's deity does indeed — contrary to the native wisdom of the Na 'vi — interfere in human affairs . " Ann Marlowe of Forbes agreed , saying that " though Avatar has been charged with " pantheism " , its mythos is just as deeply Christian . " Another author suggested that the film 's message " leads to a renewed reverence for the natural world — a very Christian teaching . " Saritha Prabhu , an Indian @-@ born columnist for The Tennessean , saw the film as a misportrayal of pantheism : " What pantheism is , at least , to me : a silent , spiritual awe when looking ( as Einstein said ) at the ' beauty and sublimity of the universe ' , and seeing the divine manifested in different aspects of nature . What pantheism isn 't : a touchy @-@ feely , <unk> vibe as is often depicted . No wonder many Americans are turned off . " Prabhu also criticized Hollywood and Western media for what she saw as their generally poor job of portraying Eastern spirituality .

 Though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from October 8 , 1910 . It states : " John Warren , a prosperous young clerk , is run down by a taxi cab while crossing a city street . The chauffeur , Allen , afraid of the consequences of his carelessness , makes his escape when he sees a crowd gathering around his victim . He abandons his machine on a lonely country road , and catching a westbound train , succeeds in making good his escape . Six years later finds John , now a cripple , living in a mining town with his devoted wife . Here John , incapacitated from other work , lives out a miserable existence as the timekeeper at the mine . Here , also , Allen comes , applying for work as a miner . They do not recognize each other . John , poor and ill , is visited by another misfortune . His beloved wife , who has clung to him through all the years of his adversity , sickens and dies .

 The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil . Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but at least two possible candidates exist . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . The cast credits are unknown , but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary . In late 1910 , the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films . The list includes G.W. Abbe , Justus D. Barnes , Frank H. Crane , Irene Crane , Marie Eline , Violet Heming , Martin J. Faust , Thomas Fortune , George Middleton , Grace Moore , John W. Noble , Anna Rosemond , Mrs. George Walters . In one scene , the appearance of the wife was described as being facilitated by " trick printing " , and was possibly created by a double exposure . Bowers notes that the sister was listed as the wife in the official synopsis , but it is unlikely that such a distinction in cast roles was ever made in the inter @-@ titles due to the confusion . Bowers stated that names were used in to keep track of who was who , but patrons were unaware of the characters ' names . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 The single reel drama , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet long , was released on October 7 , 1910 . The film likely had a wide national release , with advertising theaters known in Kansas , Maryland , Illinois , Oklahoma , and Minnesota . 
 The film received negative reviews in trade publications and it was deemed a distinct departure from the nature of other Thanhouser releases . The film 's plot was criticized by reviewers for being concerned main character 's misery . In response to the illogical plot , the The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer stated , " Why the cripple should go West as soon as he is able to hobble isn 't clear ; perhaps the West is such a delightfully vague term that it induces haziness of reasoning . " The reviewer also noted the inexplicable reason why Allen , who originally fled , would suddenly consent to be willingly murdered by John . The reviewer opined that the story was almost maudlin in places and the acting was not sincere because the actors knew the plot was absurd . The Moving Picture World also reviewed the film quite negatively , " Possibly the dramatic qualities of this picture are sufficient reason for its existence ; but it has no other reason . It is not entertaining . It is not instructive . It cannot amuse . The shadow of death pervades it and the horror tragedy is the principal factor . It is such a departure from the usual Thanhouser that it seems as though the regular producer was absent when it flipped past the company 's censor . " Advertisers for the film listed it in a variety of ways from a strong drama to having real mining activities . The film is presumed lost .

 The Kelowna Rockets arranged for Schenn to join the team during their Memorial Cup run at the end of the 2004 – 05 season . He roomed with defenceman Shea Weber as the team wanted him to learn about his future role . Schenn debuted with the Rockets during the 2005 – 06 season , and was named the team 's Rookie of the Year . He served as an alternate captain for the team during the 2007 – 08 season . Later in that same season , Schenn was named to the WHL 's roster for the ADT Canada @-@ Russia Challenge and participated in the annual Canadian Hockey League Top Prospects Game , where he served as a team captain and scored a goal . While playing in Kelowna , he was often paired with current Winnipeg Jets defenceman Tyler Myers , former winner of the NHL 's Calder Memorial Trophy .

 Early reports from the Maple Leafs training camp in September 2008 indicated Schenn was likely to be returned to his junior club for the 2008 – 09 season . On October 7 , 2008 , he signed a contract with the Maple Leafs with a base salary of $ 850 @,@ 000 per season and performance bonuses that could raise the value as high as $ 1 @.@ 25 million per season . After training camp , Schenn was chosen for the team roster at the start of the 2008 – 09 season , making his NHL debut on October 9 against the Detroit Red Wings . On October 29 , Schenn recorded an assist for his first career NHL point against the New Jersey Devils . Later in the season , he scored his first goal against Montreal Canadiens goaltender Carey Price . In January 2009 , Schenn missed 12 games with a lower @-@ body injury , the only games he missed during his rookie season . Schenn played for the Rookie YoungStars team in the 2008 – 09 NHL YoungStars Game . On March 14 , 2009 , he recorded his first multi @-@ point ( two assists ) game in an 8 – 6 win against the Calgary Flames . The NHL named Schenn to the 2008 – 09 All @-@ Rookie Team on June 18 , 2009 , along with fellow 2008 draftee Drew Doughty . The award acknowledged Schenn 's defensive prowess and physical play , as he led all NHL rookies in blocked shots and all rookie defencemen in hits . Schenn finished his first season in the NHL with two goals and 12 assists in 70 games played . 
 Expectations for Schenn were high heading into the 2009 – 10 season . During training camp , Toronto Head Coach Ron Wilson named him as one of the team 's top four defencemen . As the season progressed , however , Schenn 's play was disappointing , and Wilson kept him out of the lineup for a game in October and again for a three @-@ game stretch in December . Towards the end of the season , Schenn and some of his younger teammates improved their play . In a game against the Ottawa Senators , Schenn posted his first career two @-@ goal game , helping him finish the season with new career @-@ highs in goals ( 5 ) and points ( 17 ) in 79 games played . 
 Schenn had a strong start to the 2010 – 11 season , playing with veteran Tomáš <unk> . Prior to a game against the Philadelphia Flyers , Wilson assessed Schenn 's play as " great . " When <unk> was traded to the Boston Bruins in February 2011 , Schenn was briefly named an alternate captain in his place , until Colby Armstrong returned to the lineup after an injury . Wilson felt that Schenn had made significant strides in his third NHL season : " He 's learned a lot ... He 's not on the ice for as many goals against any more . " At the end of the season , Schenn had tied his career @-@ high for goals with five and set new personal records for assists ( 17 ) and total points ( 22 ) while playing in all 82 games for the Maple Leafs .

I can ’ t describe how cool this is . " On June 28 , 2012 , it was announced that Schenn was going to wear number 22 for the Flyers , as his usual number 2 was retired from the team in honour of defenceman Mark Howe . 
 During the 2015 – 16 season , Schenn appeared in 29 games for 5 points before he was traded by the Flyers alongside Vincent Lecavalier to the team that drafted his brother Brayden 5th overall in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft , the Los Angeles Kings , in exchange for a third round pick in 2016 and prospect Jordan Weal on January 6 , 2016 .

 During the 2007 – 08 season , Schenn was named to Canada 's selection camp roster for the 2008 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships . The final roster was named December 13 , 2007 , and Schenn was selected for the team , being paired with Thomas Hickey as the top defensive tandem . Canada won the gold medal and Schenn finished the tournament with a plus @-@ minus rating of + 5 to lead the team . Hockey analyst Pierre McGuire dubbed him " the human eraser " for his play internationally . 
 After his rookie season in the NHL , Schenn was named to the senior Canadian roster for the 2009 IIHF World Championship .

 = Metroid ( video game ) = 
 Metroid is an action @-@ adventure video game , and the first entry in the Metroid series . It was co @-@ developed by Nintendo 's Research and Development 1 division and Intelligent Systems , and was released for the Famicom Disk System in Japan on August 6 , 1986 , and for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in August 1987 , and in Europe in January 1988 . The game was re @-@ released for the Game Boy Advance in October 2004 , and for the Wii Virtual Console in Europe in July 2007 , in North America in August 2007 , and in Japan in March 2008 . Metroid was produced by Gunpei Yokoi , directed by Satoru Okada and Yoshio Sakamoto , and had music composed by Hirokazu Tanaka . 
 Set on the planet Zebes , the story follows Samus Aran as she attempts to retrieve the parasitic Metroid organisms that were stolen by Space Pirates , who plan to replicate the Metroids by exposing them to beta rays and then use them as biological weapons to destroy Samus and all who oppose them . The game 's style , focusing on exploration and the search for power @-@ ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas , influenced other video games . Its varied endings for fast completion times made it a popular game for speedrunning . Metroid was lauded for being one of the first video games to feature a female protagonist , though the player must complete the game in under five hours for this to be revealed , with the game 's English @-@ language instruction manual even using " he " to refer to the protagonist . Nintendo Power ranked Metroid 11th on their list of the best video games made on a Nintendo video game console . On Top 100 Games lists , Metroid was ranked 7th by Game Informer and 69th by Electronic Gaming Monthly . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Metroid is an action @-@ adventure game in which the player controls Samus Aran in sprite @-@ rendered two @-@ dimensional landscapes . The game takes place on the planet Zebes , a large , open @-@ ended world with areas connected by doors and elevators . The player controls Samus Aran as she travels through the planet 's caverns and hunts Space Pirates . She begins with a weak power beam as her only weapon , and with only the ability to jump . The player explores more areas and collects power @-@ ups that grant Samus special abilities and enhance her armor and weaponry , allowing her to enter areas that were previously inaccessible . Among the power @-@ ups that are included in the game are the Morph Ball , which allows Samus to curl into a ball to roll into tunnels ; the Bomb , which can only be used while in ball form and can open hidden floor / wall paths ; and the Screw Attack , a somersaulting move that destroys enemies in its path . In addition to common enemies , Samus encounters two bosses , Kraid and Ridley , whom she must defeat in order to progress . Ordinary enemies typically yield additional energy or ammunition when destroyed , and the player can increase Samus 's carrying capacities by finding storage tanks and defeating bosses . Once Kraid and Ridley have both been defeated , the player can open the path to the final area and confront the Mother Brain . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Chronologically , Metroid takes place first in the fictional Metroid universe . Space Pirates attack a Galactic Federation @-@ owned space research vessel and seize samples of Metroid creatures . Dangerous floating organisms , Metroids can latch on to any organism and drain its life energy to kill it . The Space Pirates plan to replicate Metroids by exposing them to beta rays and then using them as biological weapons to destroy all living beings that oppose them . While searching for the stolen Metroids , the Galactic Federation locates the Space Pirates ' base of operations on the planet Zebes . The Federation assaults the planet , but the Pirates resist , forcing the Federation to retreat . As a last resort , the Federation decides to send a lone bounty hunter to penetrate the Pirates ' base and destroy Mother Brain , the biomechanical life @-@ form that controls the Space Pirates ' fortress and its defenses . Considered the greatest of all bounty hunters , Samus Aran is chosen for the mission . Samus lands on the surface of Zebes and explores the planet , travelling through the planet 's caverns . She eventually comes across Kraid , an ally of the Space Pirates , and Ridley , the Space Pirates ' commander , and defeats them both . Eventually , Samus finds and destroys Mother Brain . She then places a time bomb set for 99 @.@ 9 seconds , and escapes the collapsing lair . 
 = = Development = = 
 After Nintendo 's release of commercially successful platforming games in the 1980s , including Donkey Kong ( 1981 ) , Ice Climber ( 1985 ) , and Super Mario Bros. ( 1985 ) , as well as the critically acclaimed adventure game The Legend of Zelda ( 1986 ) , the company began work on an action game . The game was dubbed Metroid , which is a portmanteau of the words " metro " and " android " . It was co @-@ developed by Nintendo 's Research and Development 1 division and Intelligent Systems , and produced by Gunpei Yokoi . Metroid was directed by Satoru Okada and Yoshio Sakamoto ( credited as ' Yamamoto ' ) , and featured music written by Hirokazu Tanaka ( credited as ' Hip Tanaka ' ) . Makoto Kano ( credited under his last name ) was tasked to create the scenario , and Hiroji Kiyotake ( credited under his last name ) , Hirofumi Matsuoka ( credited as ' New Matsuoka ' ) and Yoshio Sakamoto ( credited as ' <unk> ' ) designed the game 's characters . The character design for Samus Aran was created by Kiyotake . Officially defined as a scrolling shooter video game , Nintendo released Metroid for the Family Computer Disk System on August 6 , 1986 , and on the Nintendo Entertainment System in August 1987 . 
 The production was described as a " very free working environment " by Tanaka , who stated that , despite being the composer , he also gave input for the game 's graphics and helped name the game 's areas . Part way through development , one of the developers asked the others , " Hey , wouldn 't that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman ? " . This idea was incorporated into the game , though the English @-@ language instruction manual for the game uses the pronoun " he " many times in reference to Samus . Ridley Scott 's 1979 horror film Alien was described by Sakamoto as a " huge influence " on Metroid after the game 's world had been created . The development staff was affected by the work of the film 's creature designer H. R. Giger , and found his creations to be fitting for the Metroid universe . 
 Nintendo attempted to set Metroid apart from other games by making it a nonlinear adventure @-@ based game , in which exploration was a crucial part of the experience . The game often requires that players retrace their steps to progress , forcing the player to scroll the screen left in addition to moving it right , as was the case in most contemporary games . Metroid was also considered one of the first video games to impress a feeling of desperation and solitude on the player . Following The Legend of Zelda , Metroid helped pioneer the idea of acquiring tools to strengthen characters and help progress through the game . Up until that point , most ability @-@ enhancing power @-@ ups like the Power Shot in Gauntlet ( 1985 ) and the Starman in Super Mario Bros. offered only temporary boosts to characters , and they were not required to complete the game . In Metroid , however , items were permanent fixtures that lasted until the end . In particular , missiles and the ice beam were required to finish the game . 
 After defeating Mother Brain , the player is given an end screen based on the time it took them to get there . Metroid is one of the first games to contain multiple endings , with five in total . In the third , fourth , and fifth endings , Samus Aran appears without her suit , and for the first time , reveals herself to be a woman . In Japan , the Disk Card media used by the Disk System allowed players to save up to three different games in Metroid , similar to the three save slots in The Legend of Zelda in the West . Use of an internal battery to manage files was not fully realized in time for Metroid 's international release . The Western versions of Metroid use a password system that was new to the industry at the time , in which players write down a 24 @-@ letter code and re @-@ enter it into the game when they wish to continue a previous session . Codes also allow for changes in gameplay ; the " <unk> <unk> " grants Samus infinite ammunition , health , all power @-@ ups , and a modified Ice Beam . The " JUSTIN <unk> " code lets the player play as Samus without her Power Suit , which was thought by some to be the only way to use the feature , however it is available simply by beating the game quickly enough to reveal Samus wearing a leotard at the ending sequence . However , the game on the Nintendo 3DS becomes inoperable if the player enters a code that the game does not recognize . 
 = = Music = = 
 Tanaka said he wanted to make a score that made players feel like they were encountering a " living organism " and had no distinction between music and sound effects . The only time a melodic theme is heard is when Mother Brain is defeated in order to give the victorious player catharsis . During the rest of the game , the melodies are more minimalistic , because Tanaka wanted the soundtrack to be the opposite of the " hummable , " pop tunes found in other games at that time . 
 In his book Maestro Mario : How Nintendo Transformed Videogame Music into an Art , videogame scholar Andrew Schartmann notes the possible influence of Jerry Goldsmith 's Alien score on Tanaka 's music — a hypothesis supported by Sakamoto 's acknowledgement of Alien 's influence on the game 's development . As Schartmann notes , " Much like Metroid , the movie owes some of its <unk> moments to silence . " Schartmann further argues that Tanaka 's emphasis on silence was revolutionary to videogame composition : 
 Tanaka ’ s greatest contribution to game music comes , paradoxically , in the form of silence . He was arguably the first videogame composer to emphasize the absence of sound in his music . Tanaka ’ s score is an embodiment of isolation and atmospheric effect — one that penetrates deeply into the emotions . 
 This view is echoed by Gamespot 's History of Metroid , which notes how the " [ game 's music ] superbly evoked the proper feelings of solitude and loneliness one would expect while infiltrating a hostile alien planet alone . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 Metroid has shipped 2 @.@ 73 million units worldwide . In 2006 , Nintendo Power ranked Metroid as the 11th @-@ best game on its list of the Top 200 Games on a Nintendo video game console . Two years later , the magazine also named Metroid the fifth @-@ best game for the Nintendo Entertainment System in its Best of the Best feature , describing it as a combination of Super Mario Bros. ' s platforming and The Legend of Zelda 's exploration and character upgrades . On Top 100 Games lists , the game was ranked 69th by Electronic Gaming Monthly , and 6th by Game Informer then 7th in 2009 by Game Informer . Game Informer also put Metroid 7th on their list of " The Top 200 Games of All Time " , saying that it " started the concept of open exploration in games " . GamesRadar ranked it the fifth best NES game ever made . The staff felt that it had aged after the release of Super Metroid but was " fantastic for its time " . Metroid 's multiple endings enticed players to race through the game as fast as possible , a method of play commonly known as speedrunning . The game was re @-@ released or made available several times after its original launch . Linking the Game Boy Advance game Metroid Fusion ( 2002 ) with the Nintendo GameCube 's Metroid Prime ( 2002 ) using a special cable unlocks the full version of Metroid . An emulated version of Metroid was available as a bonus upon completion of Metroid : Zero Mission ( 2004 ) . A Game Boy Advance port of Metroid , part of the Classic NES Series collection , was released in Japan on August 10 , 2004 , in North America on October 25 , 2004 , and in Europe on January 7 , 2005 . The game arrived on the Wii Virtual Console in Europe on July 20 , 2007 , in North America on August 13 , 2007 , and in Japan on March 4 , 2008 . Metroid was released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in March 1 , 2012 . This release was featured amongst other games from the NES and Super NES to be released for the 3DS on a tech demo called Classic Games at E3 2010 . Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils @-@ Aimé said " not to think of them as remakes " . Miyamoto said that these classics might be using " new features in the games that would take advantage of the 3DS ' capabilities " . 
 In a retrospective focusing on the entire Metroid series , GameTrailers remarked on the original game 's legacy and its effect on the video game industry . They noted that starting with Metroid , search and discovery is what continues to make the franchise popular . The website felt that the combination of detailed sprites , original map designs , and an intimidating musical score " generated an unparalleled ambience and atmosphere that trapped the viewer in an almost claustrophobic state " . They also noted that the Morph Ball , first introduced in Metroid , " slammed an undeniable stamp of coolness on the whole experience and the franchise " , and they enjoyed the end segment after defeating Mother Brain , claiming that the race to escape the planet Zebes was a " twist few saw coming " . The game brought " explosive action " to the Nintendo Entertainment System and a newfound respect for female protagonists . Noting that Metroid was not the first game to offer an open world , nor was it the first side @-@ view platformer exploration game , and neither was it the first game to allow players to reach new areas using newly acquired items , Gamasutra praised Metroid for being perhaps the first video game to " take these different elements and rigorously mold them into a game @-@ ruling structure " . 
 Reviewing the original NES game , Allgame awarded Metroid with a five stars , their highest rating . The review praised the game over Metroid II : Return of Samus and Super Metroid , stating that " Metroid 's not just a classic because of its astounding graphics , cinematic sound effects , accurate control and fresh gameplay , but also because of its staying power . " Reviewing the Classic NES Series version of the game , GameSpot noted that 18 years after its initial release , Metroid " just doesn 't measure up to today 's action adventure standards " , giving the game a rating of 5 @.@ 2 out of 10 , for " mediocre " . For the Wii Virtual Console version , IGN commented that the game 's presentation , graphics , and sound were basic . However , they were still pleased with Metroid 's " impressive " gameplay , rating the game 8 @.@ 0 out of 10 , for " great , " and giving it an Editor 's Choice award . The review stated that the game was " still impressive in scope " and that the price was " a deal for this adventure " while criticising the number of times it has been re @-@ released and noting that it takes " patience " to get past the high initial difficulty curve . In GameSpot 's review of the Virtual Console version , they criticized its " frustrating room layouts " and " constantly flickering graphics " . In particular , the website was disappointed that Nintendo did not make any changes to the game , specifically criticizing the lack of a save feature . 
 Metroid 's gameplay style , focusing on exploration and searching for power @-@ ups to reach previously inaccessible areas , influenced other series , most notably the post @-@ Symphony of the Night titles of the Castlevania series . The revelation of Samus being a woman was also lauded as innovative , with GameTrailers remarking that this " blew the norm of women in pieces , at a time when female video game characters were forced into the role of dutiful queen or kidnapped princess , missile @-@ blasting the way for other characters like Chun @-@ Li [ from the Street Fighter series ] and Lara Croft [ from the Tomb Raider series ] " .

 = Session of Christ = 
 The Christian doctrine of the Session of Christ or heavenly session says that Jesus Christ is seated at the right hand of God the Father in Heaven — the word " session " is an archaic noun meaning " sitting . " Although the word formerly meant " the act of sitting down , " its meaning is somewhat broader in current English usage , and is used to refer to a sitting for various reasons , such as a teaching session , or a court or council being in session . The New Testament also depicts Jesus as standing and walking in Heaven , but the Session of Christ has special theological significance because of its connection to the role of Christ as King . The Session of Christ is one of the doctrines specifically mentioned in the Apostles ' Creed , where " sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty " immediately follows the statement of the Ascension . 
 = = Biblical references = = 
 According to the Book of Acts , Acts 2 : 33 , after Jesus ' resurrection and ascension , he was " exalted to the right hand of God . " Preaching on the Day of Pentecost , Peter saw Jesus ' exaltation as a fulfilment of Psalm 110 : 1 , The LORD says to my Lord : " Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet . " In the Bible , the " right hand " is the special place of honour . 
 The idea of Christ 's heavenly session appears a second time in the account of Peter 's preaching in the Book of Acts . In Acts 5 : 31 , Peter says that God exalted Jesus , " to his own right hand " ( <unk> ) , though Louis <unk> notes that the dative <unk> <unk> may have to be taken in the instrumental sense ( " by his own right hand " ) rather than a local sense ( " at his own right hand " ) . 
 The heavenly session was important to other writers of the New Testament . In the Epistle to the Hebrews , Hebrews 10 : 12 , it says that Jesus " sat down at the right hand of God , " after he had " offered for all time one sacrifice for sins . " As in Acts 2 , the language of Psalm 110 is used , the next verse saying that Jesus is waiting " for his enemies to be made his footstool . " Other New Testament passages that speak of Christ as being at God 's right hand are Ephesians 1 : 20 ( God seated Christ " at his right hand in the heavenly realms " ) and <unk> 3 : 22 ( Jesus has " gone into heaven and is at God 's right hand " ) . 
 In Matthew Matthew 26 : 64 and Mark 14 : 62 , Jesus says to Caiaphas , " you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power " . This is a reference to Daniel 7 : 13 , in which Daniel sees a vision of " one like a son of man " coming to the Ancient of Days . 
 = = Posture = = 
 The word " session " is an archaic noun meaning sitting . Wayne <unk> notes that the word formerly meant " the act of sitting down , " but that it no longer has that sole meaning in ordinary English usage today . This language is used in Psalm 110 : 1 and Hebrews 10 : 12 . In Acts 7 : 55 , however , Stephen sees Jesus standing at the right hand of God . This may represent Jesus " rising momentarily from the throne of glory to greet his proto @-@ martyr , " standing as a witness to vindicate Stephen 's testimony , or preparing to return . 
 In the Book of Revelation , Revelation 2 : 1 , on the other hand , Jesus is referred to as walking among the seven golden <unk> . Robert <unk> suggests that since these <unk> represent seven churches , Jesus ' motion indicates that he is " present in their midst and aware of their activities . " 
 = = In the creeds = = 
 The Apostles ' Creed says of Jesus that " He ascended into heaven , and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty " ( 1662 Book of Common Prayer ) . The words " and sitteth on the right hand of the Father , " do not appear in the Nicene Creed of 325 , but are present in the <unk> @-@ Constantinopolitan Creed of 381 , and are retained in all English versions of the Nicene Creed . 
 = = Theological significance = = 
 In the Bible , to be at the right side " is to be identified as being in the special place of honor , " and thus " the full participation of the risen Christ in God 's honor and glory is emphasized by his being at God 's right hand . " 
 The heavenly session is often connected to the enthronement of Christ as King . The Catechism of the Catholic Church says that " being seated at the Father 's right hand signifies the inauguration of the Messiah 's kingdom . " Louis <unk> notes that , in his session , Christ is " publicly inaugurated as God @-@ man , and as such receives the government of the Church and of heaven and earth , and enters solemnly upon the actual administration of the power committed to Him . " 
 In Hebrews 10 : 12 , however , it is Jesus ' priestly office that is in view . The session refers to the completed nature of the work , in the same way that " a human being will sit down at the completion of a large work to enjoy the satisfaction of having accomplished it . " F. F. Bruce argues that 
 The presence of Messiah at God 's right hand means that for His people there was now a way of access to God more immediate and heart @-@ satisfying than the obsolete temple ritual had ever been able to provide . 
 Karl Barth says that the session of Christ is " the first and the last thing that matters for our existence in time , " and that 
 Whatever prosperity or defeat may occur in our space , whatever may become and pass away , there is one constant , one thing that remains and continues , this sitting of His at the right hand of God the Father .

 = Lactarius subflammeus = 
 Lactarius subflammeus , commonly known as the orange milk cap , is a species of fungus in the Russulaceae family . It is found in western North America in the late summer and fall and is especially common in the Pacific Northwest , where it grows on the ground near conifers like pine and spruce . The brightly colored fruit bodies , which are slimy or sticky , have scarlet caps when young that soon fade to brilliant orange . The stem — typically longer than the width of the cap — is also bright orange but the gills are whitish . The mushroom secretes a whitish latex when it is cut or injured . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described by Lexemuel Ray Hesler and Alexander H. Smith in their 1979 monograph of North American species of the genus Lactarius , based on specimens collected from Pacific City , Oregon . Prior to this description , the species had frequently been confused in the literature with L. aurantiacus . The specific epithet subflammeus means " almost flame color " . It is classified in the section Russularia of the subgenus Russularia of Lactarius . Species in this subgenus have small to medium @-@ sized and fragile fruit bodies . 
 Lactarius subflammeus is commonly known as the " orange milk cap " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap is 3 – 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 8 in ) wide , convex , eventually becoming shallowly depressed in the center . The margin of the cap is curved inward then arched , with short translucent striations ( grooves ) at maturity . The cap surface is slimy to sticky , smooth , not zonate . It is scarlet when young , but becomes orange to yellowish @-@ orange and duller when older . The attachment of the gills to the stem is adnate ( squarely attached ) to decurrent ( running down the length of the stem ) ; the gills are moderately broad , with spacing close to subdistant ( with visible spaces between the gills ) . They are whitish or colored similar to the cap but paler . The stem is 4 – 9 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 5 in ) long , 5 – 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 6 in ) thick , and thicker near the base . The smooth stem surface can be either moist or dry depending on the moisture in the environment . It is hollow , fragile , and colored like the cap . The flesh is thin , fragile , pale pinkish @-@ buff to dull orangish @-@ buff . The mushroom 's odor is not distinctive , and the taste slowly becomes acrid . The latex is white , and does not change color with continued exposure to air . It does not stain the tissues , and tastes acrid . The spore print is white . The edibility of the fruit bodies is unknown , and consumption is not recommended . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 The spores are 7 @.@ 5 – 9 by 6 @.@ 5 – 7 @.@ 5 µm , with an ellipsoid shape . Their surfaces are ornamented with warts and short ridges that do not form a reticulum ( a network of raised net @-@ like ridges on the surface ) , with ridges up to 1 @.@ 0 µm high . The spores are hyaline ( translucent ) , and amyloid — they absorb iodine when stained with Melzer 's reagent . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four @-@ spored , and measure 42 by 9 µm . The cap cuticle is a modified ixotrichoderm , meaning that the hyphae are embedded in a slimy or gelatinous layer . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Lactarius luculentus var. luculentus is similar in appearance , but it has an ochraceous @-@ tawny to ochraceous @-@ buff cap and stem , flesh that tastes slightly bitter before slowly turning acrid , white latex that tastes mild to somewhat astringent , and a buff @-@ colored spore print . Lactarius luculentus var. laetus is another lookalike , but may be distinguished by a brownish @-@ orange to grayish @-@ orange stem , and mild @-@ tasting latex . <unk> <unk> has white latex that slowly changes color to yellow , and Lactarius <unk> has similar overall coloring but white latex that changes to yellow . The Californian species L. <unk> has a sticky orange @-@ brown to caramel @-@ colored cap . It has a mild taste , abundant latex , and as its specific epithet suggests , smells like coconut when it is dry . 
 = = Ecology , habitat and distribution = = 
 Like all species in the genus Lactarius , L. subflammeus is mycorrhizal , forming mutualistic associations with trees . The fungus and the plant forms structures called ectomycorrhizae , a specialized sheath of hyphae on the surface of the root from which hyphae extend into the soil and into the outer cortical cells of the root . The fruit bodies of L. subflammeus grow scattered to grouped under conifers or in mixed conifer @-@ hardwood forests near pine and spruce , from August to December . The fungus is widely distributed in the Pacific Northwest , where it is very common in conifer forests . The habitat of the type location was coastal sand dunes under pine . States from which the fungus has been collected include Washington , Idaho , Oregon , California , and Colorado . The mushroom 's range extends north into Canada , where it has been found near Victoria , British Columbia in coastal forests dominated by Douglas @-@ fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii ) .

 The French destroyer Chacal was the name ship of her class of destroyers ( contre @-@ torpilleur ) built for the French Navy during the 1920s . Initially assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron , she spent most of the following decade as a training ship . The ship was assigned convoy escort duties in the Atlantic after the start of World War II in September 1939 until she was committed to the English Channel after the Battle of France began in May 1940 . Chacal was crippled by German bombers and artillery on 23 / 24 May and had to beach herself near Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Chacal @-@ class ships were designed to counter the large Italian Leone @-@ class destroyers .

They were powered by two geared steam turbines , each driving one propeller shaft , using steam provided by five du Temple boilers . The turbines were designed to produce 50 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 37 @,@ 000 kW ; 49 @,@ 000 shp ) , which would propel the ship at 35 @.@ 5 knots ( 65 @.@ 7 km / h ; 40 @.@ 9 mph ) . During her sea trials on 18 May 1926 , Chacal 's turbines provided 54 @,@ 911 metric horsepower ( 40 @,@ 387 kW ; 54 @,@ 160 shp ) and she reached 35 @.@ 3 knots ( 65 @.@ 4 km / h ; 40 @.@ 6 mph ) for a single hour . The ships carried 530 metric tons ( 522 long tons ) of fuel oil which gave them a range of 3 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 600 km ; 3 @,@ 500 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . Their crew consisted of 10 officers and 187 crewmen in peacetime and 12 officers and 209 enlisted men in wartime . 
 The main armament of the Chacal @-@ class ships consisted of five Canon de 130 mm modèle 1919 guns in single mounts , one superfiring pair fore and aft of the superstructure and the fifth gun abaft the aft funnel . The guns were numbered ' 1' to ' 5' from front to rear . Their anti @-@ aircraft armament consisted of two Canon de 75 mm modèle 1924 guns in single mounts positioned amidships . The ships carried two above @-@ water triple sets of 550 @-@ millimeter ( 21 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . A pair of depth charge chutes were built into their stern ; these housed a total of twenty 200 @-@ kilogram ( 440 lb ) depth charges . They were also fitted with four depth @-@ charge throwers for which they carried a dozen 100 @-@ kilogram ( 220 lb ) depth charges .

Chacal was assigned to the 1st Large Destroyer Division ( 1ère division de contre @-@ torpeilleurs ) ( DCT ) of the Mediterranean Squadron ( renamed 5th Light Division ( Division légère ) ( DL ) of the First Squadron ( 1ère Escadre ) on 1 February 1927 ) based at Toulon upon completion , together with her sister ships Panthère and Tigre . On 27 April 1927 , the ship participated in a naval review by Gaston Doumergue , President of France , off Marseilles . The following month , she was one of the ships that escorted Doumergue across the English Channel during his state visit to Britain in May – June 1927 . The ship was present when he next reviewed the fleet on 3 July 1928 off Le Havre . 
 Chacal and Tigre escorted the light cruiser Primauguet to French West Africa between 13 January and 10 April 1931 . The four depth charge throwers were removed from Chacal in 1932 and the ship was briefly assigned to the 9th DL of the Torpedo Training School ( Ecole d 'application du lancement à la mer ) at Toulon on 1 October until she was relieved of that assignment the following year . About a year later , the 75 @-@ millimeter guns were replaced by four twin mounts for 13 @.@ 2 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 5 in ) anti @-@ aircraft machineguns . On 15 July 1935 , Chacal and her sister Léopard of the 8th DL were assigned to the Naval School ( Ecole Navale ) at Brest . On 12 April 1937 , the 8th DL was redesignated as the 2nd DCT ; their sister Jaguar joined them in September . 
 By 7 September 1939 , Chacal was no longer a part of the 2nd DCT and was assigned to the Western Command ( Forces maritimes de l 'Ouest ) for convoy escort duties from October to May 1940 where she guarded convoys traveling between Gibraltar and Brest as well as Casablanca , French Morocco , and Le Verdon @-@ sur @-@ Mer . In November , the ship had a British Type 123 ASDIC installed ; in addition two depth @-@ charge throwers were reinstalled , No. 3 gun removed , and her depth charge stowage reduced to a dozen 200 kg and eight 100 kg depth charges to improve her stability . 
 By 22 May Chacal was reassigned to the 2nd DCT when the unit was tasked to carry demolition teams to the northernmost French ports ; the ship arrived at Calais that evening . Together with Léopard and eight smaller destroyers , Chacal bombarded advancing German troops as they approached the defenses of Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer throughout the 23rd . During the night of 23 – 24 May , the ship was badly damaged by bombs from Heinkel He 111 bombers and shells from German artillery and had to be beached between Ambleteuse and Wimereux lest she sink . 
 = CMLL World Heavyweight Championship = 
 The CMLL World Heavyweight Championship ( Spanish : Campeonato Mundial de Peso Completo del CMLL ) is a professional wrestling world heavyweight championship established in 1991 and promoted by Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre . CMLL introduced the championship as they moved away from the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) to signal their independence . As part of the move away from the NWA they established a number of championships designated as " CMLL World Championships " for a variety of divisions . The heavyweight championship was the first CMLL title to be created , and the inaugural champion was Konnan el <unk> , who won the title by defeating his storyline rival Cien Caras in the finals of a tournament on June 9 , 1991 . The current champion is Máximo Sexy , the 15th overall person to hold the championship and the 18th overall champion . 
 In most professional wrestling promotions around the world the " heavyweight " designation is normally one used to indicate the highest ranking championship instead of an actual weight division . Traditionally , however , Mexican wrestling has used multiple weight divisions , often with the lower weight classes receiving more attention from the promoters . CMLL carries on this tradition . As it is a professional wrestling championship , it is not won legitimately ; it is instead won via a scripted ending to a match . 
 = = History = = 
 The Mexican professional wrestling promotion Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre ( EMLL ) was founded in 1933 and initially recognized a series of " Mexican National " wrestling championships , endorsed by the Comisión de Box y Lucha Libre Mexico D.F. ( Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission ) . The Mexican National Heavyweight Championship was created in 1926 and over time EMLL began promoting matches for that championship with the approval and oversight of the wrestling commission . In the 1950s EMLL became a member of the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) and thus recognized the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and would on occasion promote title matches for the NWA in Mexico . 
 In the late 1980s EMLL left the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) to avoid the politics of the NWA and would later rebrand themselves as " Consejo <unk> de Lucha Libre " ( CMLL ) . By the start of the 1990s CMLL began to downplay the Mexican National Heavyweight Championship , which featured less frequently on CMLL shows until they stopped promoting it altogether . In 1991 CMLL decided to create a series of CMLL branded world championships , the first of which was for the Heavyweight division . The first champion was crowned in the finals of a 16 man tournament that saw Konnan el <unk> defeat Cien Caras . Konnan lost the title to Cien Caras in his first title defense on August 18 , 1991 , making him one of only two champions to not have a single successful title defense . Cien Caras left CMLL in the summer of 1992 as he decided to join former CMLL promoter Antonio Peña in Peña 's newly formed Asistencia Asesoría y Administración ( AAA ) wrestling promotion , leaving CMLL without a heavyweight champion . CMLL held a 16 @-@ man single @-@ elimination tournament from October 30 , 1992 to November 20 , 1992 , which ended with Black Magic winning the title . With the victory he became the first the first non @-@ Hispanic , and so far only British wrestler to win the Championship . On June 27 , 1993 CMLL decided to move the title onto Mexican native Brazo de Plata as he defeated Black Magic on a show in Arena México , CMLL 's main venue . 
 On April 18 , 1997 Steel became the first Canadian to win the championship as he defeated then champion Rayo de Jalisco Jr. to become the 8th overall champion . In September 1997 Steel signed a contract with the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF , later WWE ) , which forced CMLL to vacate the championship for the second time . Instead of holding a traditional tournament to crown another champion CMLL took the top three heavyweight contenders , Universo 2000 , Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Cien Caras and had the new champion decided in a match between the three . On October 19 , 1997 Universo 2000 won the title , starting the first of his three reigns , which remains a record . Universo 2000 lost the title to and regained the title from Rayo de Jalisco Jr . Universo 2000 's second reign as champion lasted a total of 1 @,@ 225 days , the longest of any championship reign . The record breaking run ended on April 18 , 2003 when Mr. Niebla won the title . Mr. Niebla was champion for 543 days before Universo 2000 regained the championship . On July 8 , 2007 Dos Caras Jr. became the 14th overall champion . His reign lasted 533 days but only saw him defend the title three times overall , defeating Lizmark Jr . , Universo 2000 and Último Guerrero . On December 22 , 2008 , Último Guerrero won the championship from Dos Caras Jr. and shortly afterwards Dos Caras Jr. left CMLL to work for WWE . On April 2 , 2009 Último Guerrero successfully defended the World title against Rey Mendoza Jr. on an independent wrestling promotion show in Gomez Palacio , marking the first time the CMLL World title was defended on a non @-@ CMLL promoted show . After a 963 day reign and 17 successful defenses , Guerrero lost the title to Héctor Garza on August 12 , 2011 . The championship was vacated on November 11 , 2011 , after Garza left CMLL for Perros del Mal Producciones , a group of former CMLL wrestlers who broke away from the promotion in late 2011 . On January 1 , 2012 , El Terrible became the new champion , when he defeated CMLL World Light Heavyweight Champion Rush in a decision match . The two had won a torneo cibernetico match a week earlier to earn spots in the match .

 Máximo Sexy is the current CMLL World Heavyweight champion . He won the title on January 30 , 2015 by defeating El Terrible . He is the 18th overall champion and the 15th person to hold the title . Universo 2000 has held the title the most times , three reigns in total . Universo 2000 also holds the record for the longest combined reign with 2 @,@ 555 days and longest single reign , 1 @,@ 225 days . The first champion , Konnan , was also the person who held the title the shortest amount of time , 70 days . Último Guerrero is officially credited with 20 successful title defenses by CMLL , the highest number of defenses of any CMLL World Heavyweight Champion . 
 On three separate occasions CMLL was forced to declare the championship vacant , which meant that there was no champion for a period of time . In all three instances this was necessitated by the then reigning champion leaving CMLL without working a match where he would lose the title to whichever successor CMLL picked . Under normal circumstances CMLL would know that a wrestler was leaving the promotion , either due to their contract not being renewed or the wrestler giving notice , which allows them time to transition the championship to a different wrestler . In the case of Cien Caras , Steel and Héctor Garza their departures from the company were so sudden and unannounced that no plans were in place and CMLL had to organize a tournament to determine the next champion . 
 = = Rules = = 
 The championship is designated as a heavyweight title , which means that the championship can officially only be competed for by wrestlers weighing at least 105 kg ( 231 lb ) . In the 20th century Mexican wrestling enforced the weight divisions more strictly , but in the 21st century the rules were occasionally ignored for the various weight divisions . The heavyweight championship was no exception as several champions were under the weight limit , for example Héctor Garza . While the Heavyweight title is traditionally considered the most prestigious weight division in professional wrestling , CMLL places more emphasis on the lower weight divisions . As such , the CMLL World Heavyweight Title is not considered the top CMLL championship . 
 With a total of twelve CMLL promoted championships being labelled as " World " titles the promotional focus shifts from championship to championship over time with no single championship being promoted as the " main " championship of the promotion . Championship matches usually take place under best two @-@ out @-@ of @-@ three falls rules . On occasion single fall title matches have taken place , especially when promoting CMLL title matches in Japan , conforming to the traditions of the local promotion .

Konnan , Rayo de Jalisco Jr . , Black Magic and Mascara Ano 2000 eliminated Brazo de Plata , Vampiro Canadiense , Universo 2000 and El <unk> in the first battle royal . In the second battle royal <unk> , Pierroth Jr . , Pirata Morgan and Cien Caras eliminated Fabulous Blondie , Gran Markus Jr . , Máscara Sagrada and El <unk> .

 International emergency medicine is a subspecialty of emergency medicine that focuses not only on the global practice of emergency medicine but also on efforts to promote the growth of emergency care as a branch of medicine throughout the world . The term international emergency medicine generally refers to the transfer of skills and knowledge — including knowledge of ambulance operations and other aspects of prehospital care — from developed emergency medical systems ( EMSs ) to those systems which are less developed . However , this definition has been criticized as oxymoronic , given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally . From this point of view , international emergency medicine is better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one 's native country . 
 Emergency medicine has been a recognized medical specialty in the United States and other developed countries for nearly forty years , although these countries ' EMSs did not become fully mature until the early 1990s . At that point , some of its practitioners turned their attention from developing the specialty at home to developing it abroad , leading to the birth of international emergency medicine . They began to support the growth of emergency medicine worldwide , doing so through conferences , national and regional emergency medicine organizations , relief and development organizations , international emergency medicine fellowships , physician exchanges , information transfer , and curriculum development . 
 Most developing countries are taking steps to develop emergency medicine as a specialty , to develop accreditation mechanisms , and to promote the development of emergency medicine training programs . Their interest is a result of improved healthcare , increasing urbanization , aging populations , the rising number of traffic fatalities , and heightened awareness of emergency medicine among their citizens . In addition , emergency medicine is useful in dealing with time @-@ sensitive illnesses , as well as improving public health through vaccinations , interventions , training , and data collection . Countries that lack mature EMSs are developing emergency medicine as a specialty so that they will be able to set up training programs and encourage medical students to pursue residencies in emergency medicine . 
 Some challenges faced in international emergency medicine include immature or non @-@ existent training programs , a lack of adequate emergency transport , a shortage of resources to fund emergency medicine development , and an absence of research that could inform developing countries how to best spend the resources they devote to emergency medicine . Additionally , the standards and methods used in countries with mature EMSs are not always suited for use in developing countries due to a lack of infrastructure , shortage of funds , or local demographics . Ambulances , the developed country standard , are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries ; instead , a variety of modes of transportation are used . Furthermore , in place of expensive medication and equipment , developing countries often opt for cheaper if slightly less effective alternatives . Although it may seem that increasing availability to emergency medicine must improve health , there is little empirical evidence to directly support that claim or to point out which methods are most effective in improving patient health . Evidence @-@ based medicine seeks to address this issue by rigorously studying the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Definition = = = 
 The most commonly accepted definition of international emergency medicine is that it is " the area of emergency medicine concerned with the development of emergency medicine in other countries . " In that definition , " other countries " refers to nations that do not have a mature emergency care system ( exemplified by board @-@ certified emergency physicians and academic emergency medicine , among other things ) . Included in those nations are some that are otherwise quite developed but lack a complete emergency medical system , such as Armenia , China , Israel , Nicaragua , and the Philippines . Work in international emergency medicine can be broken down into two main categories : 1 ) the promotion of emergency medicine as a recognized and established specialty in other countries , and 2 ) the provision of humanitarian assistance . 
 William Burdick , Mark <unk> , and Kenneth <unk> have criticized the above definition as oxymoronic , given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally . From that point of view , international emergency medicine is not solely about development of emergency medical systems but is instead better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one 's native country . 
 = = = History = = = 
 = = = = Emergency medicine = = = = 
 Emergency medicine is a specialty that was first developed in the United States in the 1960s . For the United States , the high number of traffic and other accident fatalities in the 1960s spurred a white paper from the National Academy of Sciences ; it exposed the inadequacy of the current emergency medical system and led to the establishment of modern emergency medical services . The United Kingdom , Australia , Canada , Hong Kong , and Singapore followed shortly thereafter , developing their respective emergency medicine systems in the 1970s and 1980s . 
 = = = = Beginning of the subspecialty = = = = 
 By the early 1990s , the emergency medicine systems ( EMSs ) in the United States , the United Kingdom , Australia , Canada , Hong Kong , and Singapore were largely mature , leading some practitioners to focus on developing the specialty in other countries . Thus , international emergency medicine as a subspecialty began in the 1990s , although some isolated efforts to achieve some of its goals had taken place in the late 1980s . There were several reasons for the heightened interest these practitioners had in developing emergency medicine abroad . One was the contrast between the EMSs of their countries and the EMSs of other countries . Another was the revolutions of 1989 , overthrowing authoritarian regimes , which facilitated spread of new ideas , such as emergency medicine . 
 Two international emergency medicine conferences were launched in the 1980s , the International Conference on Emergency Medicine ( <unk> ) and the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine Conference ( WADEM ) . <unk> was founded by the International Federation of Emergency Medicine , while WADEM was started by an organization of the same name . Additionally , in the 1990s various national and regional emergency medicine organizations began supporting the development of the specialty in other countries , including the American College of Emergency Physicians , the European Society for Emergency Medicine , and the Asian Society of Emergency Medicine . 
 Furthermore , countries without mature EMSs began taking more interest in developing them . One reason for this interest was the overall improvement in healthcare in these countries . Another was the increasing urbanization taking place worldwide and the corresponding shift of focus from infectious diseases to trauma and cardiorespiratory diseases , which are better managed by emergency medicine than prevention . In addition to these developments , the aging population in many countries has led to an increased need for emergency medical services . Also , American popular culture , particularly television shows , and " the demonstrated success of emergency medicine " in countries with mature EMSs both led the public in many countries to expect better emergency medical care . 
 International emergency medicine organizations , whether focused on relief or development , have also contributed to the growth of the subspecialty . Relief organizations , such as Doctors Without Borders or <unk> , serve countries that do not have mature EMSs when health catastrophes occur . These organizations also serve to " enhance [ the specialty 's ] image in the international public eye " . Some development organizations , such as Emergency International or the International Federation for Emergency Medicine , help establish and develop emergency care systems in other countries by providing " ongoing educational and organizational assistance . " 
 = = = Emergency medicine in the developing world = = = 
 Motor vehicle crashes were a major factor that led to the development of emergency medicine in the United States , the United Kingdom , Australia , Canada , Hong Kong , and Singapore , and they are a major factor leading countries to develop their own emergency medical systems today . Such crashes represent a leading cause of death for adolescents and young adults , with the majority of deaths occurring in the developing world . In recent decades , while traffic fatalities have declined in industrialized nations , they have been on the rise in developing ones . Furthermore , developing nations tend to have a higher proportion of fatalities per number of vehicles for various reasons , including lower safety standards for vehicles . The lack of available emergency care in many developing countries only serves to exacerbate this problem . This higher rate of accident mortality per vehicle exists despite the fact that there are fewer cars in Asia and Africa than in the West . Odero et al. argue that this shows a need to improve emergency medical care . 
 Emergency medical care applies to other acute health problems as well . Many illnesses with time @-@ sensitive elements are common in developing countries , including severe infections , hypoxia caused by respiratory infections , dehydration caused by diarrhoea , intentional and unintentional injuries , postpartum bleeding , and acute myocardial infarction . These are potentially life @-@ threatening conditions , yet effective treatment is often unavailable for much of the world 's population . 
 For instance , a 2008 study of medical systems in Zambia published by the International Anesthesia Research Society found that only 50 percent of hospitals had an emergency medical system that transported patients . Just 24 percent of ambulances carried oxygen , with only 40 percent carrying drugs of any kind . Furthermore , only 29 intensive care beds were available in all of the hospitals surveyed , and these were only found in major hospitals . This implies that the majority of critically ill patients are receiving care in general hospital wards . 
 Anderson et al. argue that , aside from acute care , emergency medicine can also play a significant role in public health . Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria , tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments , patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse , and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated . Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data , because of the high number of patients . Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation ( initial symptoms ) , and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios . 
 = = = Models of emergency care = = = 
 There are two primary models of emergency medicine : the Anglo @-@ American model , which relies on " bringing the patient to the hospital " , and the Franco @-@ German model , which operates through " bringing the hospital to the patient " . Thus , in the Anglo @-@ American model , the patient is rapidly transported by non @-@ physician providers to definitive care such as an emergency department in a hospital . Conversely , the Franco @-@ German approach has a physician , often an anesthesiologist , come to the patient and provide stabilizing care in the field . The patient is then triaged directly to the appropriate department of a hospital . The Anglo @-@ American model is seen in nations such as Australia , Canada , Ireland , New Zealand , the United Kingdom , and the United States , while the Franco @-@ German model is found in European countries such as Austria , France , Germany , Poland , Portugal , and Russia . Most developing emergency medical systems , including those of China , Japan , the Philippines , South Korea , and Taiwan , have been established along Anglo @-@ American lines , but little work exists to establish the advantage of either system . 
 Jeffrey Arnold and James Holliman have criticized the use of these descriptors for emergency medical systems as an oversimplification and a needless source of controversy . Instead , Arnold and Holliman have proposed that other groupings be used , such as classifying emergency medical systems as following a specialty or multidisciplinary model . Specialty systems would include those with physicians dedicated to emergency medicine , whereas multidisciplinary systems would encompass those that rely on physicians from other disciplines to provide emergency care . Such an approach would seek to categorize pre @-@ hospital care separately from in @-@ hospital systems . Within Arnold and Holliman 's understanding of emergency care models , there is also an acknowledgement that current Western models may be inadequate in the context of developing nations . For instance , a cost @-@ benefit analysis found that creating an EMS system in Kuala Lumpur that met U.S. standards for cardiac arrest response ( 85 percent of patients receive defibrillation within 6 minutes ) would cost US $ 2 @.@ 5 million and only save four neurologically intact lives per year . The primary variable responsible for that result is the relatively young demography of Kuala Lumpur , meaning that comparatively few cardiac @-@ related deaths occur . 
 An example of a developing nation establishing its own model of emergency medicine may be seen in southern Brazil . Elements of both of the major conventional models have been incorporated , with the EMS system following French influences and the ambulances being staffed by physicians , while an American approach to emergency medical residency training is also present . 
 = = Role in overall health system = = 
 = = = Developed countries = = = 
 In developed counties , training programs specifically relating to the international practice of emergency medicine are now available within many emergency medicine residencies . The curriculum that should be covered by such programs has been the subject of much discussion . Patient care , medical knowledge , practice @-@ based learning , communication skills , professionalism , and system @-@ based practice are the basic six competencies required of programs approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education , but the application of these goals can take many forms . The breadth of skills needed in international emergency medicine make it unlikely that one standardized program could fulfill the training needs for every scenario . One Australian study found that the primary topics covered by U.S. fellowship programs were emergency medicine systems development , humanitarian relief , disaster management , public health , travel and field medicine , program administration , and academic skills . Its authors argue that attempting to cover all of those areas may be unrealistic and that a more targeted focus on acquiring necessary skills might be more productive . 
 After such training is completed , or even without any EMS training , working in or visiting other nations is one way physicians can participate in international emergency medicine . Some physicians choose to pursue their careers overseas , while others opt for shorter trips . For example , a team of U.S. physicians spent seven months helping establish a new emergency department and emergency residency program in Hangzhou , China . Such exchanges can be mutually beneficial . For instance , 23 to 28 percent of all physicians in Australia , the United States , the United Kingdom and Canada received their training at medical schools outside of the country in which they currently practice . 
 = = = Developing countries = = = 
 The experience of international emergency medicine in developing countries is in some ways the opposite of that of developed ones . As of the 2000s , developing countries are attempting to establish effective systems of care and recognized specialty programs with assistance from health care providers from the developed world . In 2005 , there were only a few countries with advanced emergency medical systems , and a far greater number ( 50 + ) that were in the process of developing those systems . The process of development usually begins in academia and patient care , followed by administrative and economic concerns , and finally health policy and agendas . 
 Given the limited resources of many developing nations , funding vitally effects how emergency medicine fits into the health system . Preventive care is a crucial part of healthcare in developing countries , and it may be difficult to budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources . This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia , which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003 . Regardless of the amount of preventive care available , health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur , and emergency medical programs could increase access to care . <unk> et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive , particularly if developing countries focus on low @-@ cost but effective treatments administered by first responders . 
 = = Initiatives to expand emergency medicine = = 
 = = = Curriculum development = = = 
 <unk> et al. argue that one key component in equipping nations to develop emergency medical systems is to identify the aspects of training that are essential for health care providers . In their view , a standard curriculum is useful for identifying core issues , even if countries have very different needs and resources . To address this goal , the International Federation for Emergency Medicine developed a model curriculum in 2009 . This initiative seeks to provide a minimum basic standard that can be tailored to the specific needs of the various nations implementing training in emergency medicine . It is targeted towards all medical students in order to produce a minimum competency in emergency care for all physicians , regardless of their specialty . 
 = = = Transferring knowledge = = = 
 Countries with decades of experience in comprehensive emergency medical systems have expertise that nations that are just beginning emergency medical programs lack . Thus , there exists considerable opportunity for the transfer of knowledge to assist newly founded programs . Such transfers may be made either from a distance or in person . For instance , the International Emergency Medicine Fellowship at the University of Toronto sent a three @-@ person team to Cluj @-@ Napoca , Romania , to promote the local development of emergency medicine . An assessment of the present status was performed that identified targets for improvement in physical plant organization and patient flow ; staffing , staff education , equipment , medication and supplies ; and infection control practices . Following these designations , plans regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented , partially through international exchange trips . 
 Another conduit for the transfer of knowledge is the International Conference on Emergency Medicine , a conference held every two years for worldwide emergency physicians by the International Federation for Emergency Medicine ( <unk> ) . In 2012 , the conference took place in Dublin , Ireland . The organization was founded in 1991 by four national emergency physician organizations : the American College of Emergency Physicians , the British Association for Emergency Medicine , the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians , and the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine . The conference rotated between the founding members until 2010 , when it was held in Singapore . Many new members have been accepted since the mid @-@ 1990s , when the <unk> decided to open up membership to other nations ' emergency medicine organizations ; the conference will rotate to them as well . For instance , in 2014 the conference will be hosted in Hong Kong and in 2016 it will be held in Cape Town , South Africa . 
 There are other conferences on international emergency medicine as well , including the one that the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine ( WADEM ) has held every two years since 1987 . However , WADEM focuses more on disaster medicine than emergency medicine system development , and many of its member physicians are not specialists in emergency medicine . Additionally , the European Society for Emergency Medicine ( EuSEM ) has hosted an annual conference since 1998 . EuSEM also publishes The European Journal of Emergency Medicine , develops recommendations for emergency medicine standards for European countries , and supports a disaster medicine training center and degree program in San Marino . The Asian Society for Emergency Medicine ( Asian Society ) , which was founded in 1998 , holds its own biennial conference . In addition to that , the Asian Society , like the EuSEM , develops curriculum recommendations for Asian countries . 
 = = = Developing emergency medicine as a specialty = = = 
 One way to advance emergency medical care is to obtain the recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty in countries that currently lack it . Without such recognition , it is difficult to set up training programs or recruit potential students , as they face the uncertainly of training to obtain a credential that may end up being useless to them . Recognition increases the visibility and prestige of the profession and promotes other efforts to advance its development . Botswana may serve as a case study . Its recent recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty has been closely accompanied by the creation of the Botswana Society for Emergency Care , the establishment of a Resuscitation Training Centre and a Trauma Research Centre at the University of Botswana , and the formation of a committee to design a national policy for pre @-@ hospital care . 
 An alternate route for developing emergency medicine is to provide additional training for other specialists to equip them to practice in emergency medicine . This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement , as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire . However , after the initial expansion it is difficult for emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy , as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine . 
 = = Challenges = = 
 = = = Training = = = 
 Educational opportunities in emergency medicine are not available in many countries , and even when present , they are often in their infancy . Botswana opened its first medical school in 2009 , with a program in emergency medicine following in 2011 . The program aims to train four to six physicians in emergency medicine each year . Limitations on in @-@ country training mean that the program includes six months of training at an international site . The organization of the program is modeled on South Africa 's program due to the similarities in resource constraints and disease burdens and the eagerness of College of Emergency Medicine of South Africa and Emergency Medicine Society of South Africa to support the expansion of emergency medicine . Two years of clinical practice are required before entering the residency program , as in the South African and Australian approaches . 
 To deal with this shortage of educational opportunities , Scott Weiner et al. suggest that countries with developed emergency medical systems should focus on training the trainers . This , he believes , is a sustainable approach to promote the development of emergency medicine worldwide . It works by sending developed country health care workers to equip a small group of trainees with the necessary skills to then go on and teach the concepts to others . As such , it may be able to leverage the insights of developed emergency medical systems while remaining sustainable , as the newly trained trainers continue to spread the knowledge . The Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an example , with physicians from other specialties currently working in emergency departments being taught how to teach a new group of emergency medical specialists . 
 = = = Emergency transport = = = 
 The limitations on resources available in developing countries are particularly evident in the area of emergency transport . Ambulances , the developed country standard , are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries . Indeed , there may be no roads at all . One study found that modes of transport as diverse as motorboats , canoes , bicycles with trailers , tricycles with platforms , tractors with trailers , reconditioned vehicles , and ox carts were used for emergency transport . 
 In more advanced developing countries , establishing ambulance transport systems is more feasible , but still requires considerable expertise and planning . Prior to 2004 , Pakistan did not have an organized emergency medical system . In that year , Rescue 1122 was launched as a professional pre @-@ hospital emergency service , and it has managed to achieve an average response time of 7 minutes , comparable to that of developed nations . Some of the critical factors in its success included local manufacture of vehicles , training instructors to certify emergency medical technicians , adopting training materials to the local context , and branching out to include fire and rescue service response under a united command structure . 
 = = = Resources = = = 
 The vital nature of coping with the lack of resources available in international emergency medicine may be seen in the proportion of scientific articles that grapple with the topic . Of the top 27 articles identified by a review of the international emergency medicine literature from 2010 , 14 were classified as dealing with the practice of emergency medicine in resource @-@ constrained environments . A new dimension of thought is that of the isolated subject of technology for trauma care as published in the World Journal of Surgery by Mihir Shah et al . Topics covered included the use of the <unk> tape as the best estimate for children 's weight , green bananas as an effective treatment for diarrhea , and <unk> as a potential alternative for postpartum hemorrhage when oxytocin is not available . 
 = = = Lack of research = = = 
 Despite the thought that increasing availability to emergency medicine will improve patient outcomes , little empirical evidence exists to directly support that claim , even in developed countries . Between 1985 and 1998 only 54 randomized controlled trials related to emergency medical services were published , implying that much of the current standard of care rests upon meager support . A similar lack of direct proof exists for the effectiveness of international assistance in promoting emergency medicine in other countries . Although it may seem that such efforts must improve health , the failure to quantify international emergency medicine 's impact renders it more difficult to identify the best practices and target areas in which the most benefit may be achieved . 
 A development in recent years that seeks to address these issues has been termed evidence @-@ based medicine . As its name suggests , this approach strives to rigorously study the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition . Jeffrey Arnold argues that its application worldwide could lead to the boon of sharing best practices between emergency medicine practitioners in various countries , thus advancing the current standard of emergency care . 
 = Operation Corridor 92 = 
 Operation Corridor 92 ( Serbian : Операција <unk> 92 , Operacija <unk> 92 ) was an operation conducted during the Bosnian War by the Army of Republika Srpska ( VRS ) against the forces of the Croatian Defence Council ( HVO ) and the Croatian Army ( HV ) in northern Bosnia and Herzegovina between 24 June and 6 October 1992 . The objective of the offensive was to re @-@ establish a road link between the city of Banja Luka in the west of the country and the eastern parts of the territory controlled by the Bosnian Serbs . The offensive was prompted by the capture of Derventa by the HV and the HVO – a move that blocked the single overland road between the VRS @-@ controlled territories . 
 The VRS successfully recaptured Derventa and pushed the HVO and the HV north , capturing several towns in the process . In the second phase of the offensive , the VRS reached the Sava River , the border with Croatia , and destroyed a bridgehead held by the HV and the HVO at Bosanski Brod . The offensive involved more than 60 @,@ 000 troops and resulted in heavy casualties for all sides , especially the HVO . The outcome later caused speculation that it was the result of a political arrangement between Serb and Croatian leaders to secure a land trade . 
 = = Background = = 
 As the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA ) withdrew from Croatia following the acceptance and start of implementation of the Vance plan , its 55 @,@ 000 officers and soldiers born in Bosnia and Herzegovina were transferred to a new Bosnian Serb army , which was later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska ( Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS ) . This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992 , ahead of the 29 February – 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina . This declaration would later be cited by the Bosnian Serbs as a pretext for the Bosnian War . Bosnian Serbs began fortifying the capital , Sarajevo , and other areas on 1 March . On the following day , the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj . In the final days of March , Bosnian Serb forces bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery , drawing a border crossing by the HV 108th Brigade in response . On 4 April , JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo . 
 The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and Herzegovina faced the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine – ARBiH ) and the Croatian Defence Council ( Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO ) , reporting to the Bosniak @-@ dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively , as well as the HV , which occasionally supported HVO operations . A UN arms embargo introduced in September 1991 , had hampered the preparation of the various forces , but in late April , the VRS was able to deploy 200 @,@ 000 troops , along with hundreds of tanks , armoured personnel carriers ( APCs ) and artillery pieces , while the HVO and the Croatian Defence Forces ( Hrvatske obrambene snage – HOS ) could field approximately 25 @,@ 000 soldiers and a handful of heavy weapons . The ARBiH was largely unprepared , however , lacking heavy weapons and possessing small arms for less than half of its force of approximately 100 @,@ 000 troops . By mid @-@ May 1992 , when those JNA units which had not been transferred to the VRS withdrew from Bosnia and Herzegovina to the newly declared Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the VRS controlled approximately 60 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Following its successful defence of Bosanski Brod in March , the HVO , reinforced by HV troops , pushed the JNA and the VRS south from the town and captured the towns of Modriča and Derventa by the end of May . The capture of Derventa also severed the last road available to the Bosnian Serbs spanning VRS @-@ controlled western Bosnia around Banja Luka and the VRS @-@ held territory in the east of the country , adjacent to Serbia . That prevented the supply of Banja Luka as well as the bulk of the territory gained by the Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) and Croatian Serbs in Croatia since the initial phase of the Croatian War of Independence . 
 The loss of the road link caused substantial supply problems in Banja Luka and the surrounding area , and resulted in a VRS counterattack against the HVO and HV forces in the area . At the same time , the VRS and the JNA captured Doboj and Bosanski Šamac to the east and south of the HVO / HV advance . In June , the VRS 1st Krajina Corps initiated preliminary operations against the HVO / HV @-@ held area around Derventa , attempting to improve VRS positions needed to launch a major attack there . By 20 July , the VRS captured the villages of <unk> and <unk> north of Doboj and achieved the main objective of the preliminary advance . 
 The deaths of twelve newborn babies in Banja Luka hospital due to a shortage of incubator bottled oxygen were an immediate cause for the action .

 = = = Order of Battle = = = 
 According to Croatian author Jerko Zovak , the VRS deployed 40 @,@ 800 troops at the beginning of Operation Corridor 92 , and the force was increased to 54 @,@ 660 by the end of the initial phase of the offensive . The VRS tasked the 1st Krajina Corps with the main effort of the offensive . The corps and the operation were under command of General Momir Talić . The RSK also contributed troops to the offensive , and these forces were commanded directly by the RSK Interior Minister , Milan Martić . 
 According to Zovak , the HVO and the HV had 20 @,@ 000 troops in the region at the outset of the VRS offensive , but the troop levels declined to about 5 @,@ 000 by October . Those forces were commanded by HV Major General Petar Stipetić . The troops under his command , organised as Operational Group Posavina , included the 101st and 103rd Brigades of the HVO and elements of a large number of HV units . According to Stipetić , those included the bulk of the 108th Infantry Brigade based in Slavonski Brod , and fragments of the 109th , 111th , 123rd and 127th Brigades based in Vinkovci , Rijeka , Požega and Virovitica , as well as several Osijek @-@ based units . The 3rd Guards Brigade was also instructed to deploy to Bosanski Brod , but the order was cancelled before the unit had been moved . The piecemeal nature of the deployment , and the refusal of further units to fight in the area , was a consequence of the Croatian Defence Minister Gojko Šušak 's order that only volunteers could be deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina . According to Stipetić , a parallel chain of command existed in respect of the 108th Infantry Brigade , which remained under the control of civilian authorities in Slavonski Brod , the Croatian city just across the Sava from Bosanski Brod . 
 = = = Timeline = = = 
 On 24 June , the 1st Krajina Corps of the VRS began the offensive codenamed Operation Corridor 92 . Its first objective was to break through the HVO and HV @-@ held positions between Modriča and <unk> , and link up with the East Bosnian Corps . The secondary effort consisted of attacks towards Derventa and Bosanski Brod . The first objective was achieved after two days of heavy combat on 26 June . Afterwards , the VRS advanced towards Modriča and captured the town on 28 June . The secondary advances , facing considerably stiffer resistance by the HVO and the HV , gained little ground . 
 The second phase of the offensive was launched on 4 July . It comprised VRS advances towards Derventa , Bosanski Brod and Odžak , aiming to reach the Sava and thereby the border with Croatia , north of the three towns . Derventa was quickly captured on 4 – 5 July and the VRS continued to roll back the HVO and the HV troops . On 12 July , the VRS captured Odžak and arrived at the riverside near the town two days later . By that time , VRS troops had advanced 10 to 15 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 to 9 @.@ 3 miles ) , and reached a position within 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 miles ) of Bosanski Brod . The HVO and the HV were reduced to a bridgehead around the town . 
 In August and September , the VRS launched several attacks against the Bosanski Brod bridgehead for little gain . In mid @-@ September , the HVO and the ARBiH deployed near Brčko , further to the east , attacked the same east – west road the VRS aimed to secure through Operation Corridor 92 . The counterattack managed to capture a section of the road south of Orašje , at the eastern end of the Brčko corridor . However , the VRS restored its control of the road quickly thereafter . 
 Another push against Bosanski Brod was launched on 27 September . The advance initially had moderate success , until 4 October when the VRS rebalanced its forces , changing the sector of the bridgehead against which the 1st Krajina Corps was concentrated . The move managed to disrupt the HVO and HV defences and the VRS achieved a breakthrough , capturing Bosanski Brod on 6 October . In response , the HV and the HVO withdrew their troops and equipment in an orderly fashion , and the bridge spanning the Sava between the town and Slavonski Brod was demolished on 7 October . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In mid @-@ October and early November 1992 , the HVO briefly cut the Brčko corridor south of Orašje two more times . In turn , the VRS launched a major offensive against the HVO @-@ held bridgehead at Orašje . After some initial success , the VRS offensive failed and the HVO drove the attacking force back to the positions they had held prior to the advance . Aiming to improve the security of the Brčko corridor , units of the VRS 1st Krajina and East Bosnian Corps turned south of Brčko , and advanced 2 to 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 9 miles ) against defences held by the HVO and the ARBiH . That last push widened the Brčko corridor to just 3 kilometres at its narrowest point . 
 During the offensive , which captured 760 square kilometres ( 290 square miles ) of territory , the VRS and its allies lost 413 troops killed and a further 1 @,@ 509 wounded . According to Zovak , the HV sustained losses of 343 killed and 1 @,@ 996 wounded , while the HVO lost 918 killed and 4 @,@ 254 injured during the fighting that took place in the region between April and October . In the same period , the city of Slavonski Brod came under bombardment from VRS artillery and aircraft . A total of 11 @,@ 651 artillery shells and fourteen 9K52 Luna @-@ M rockets were fired against the city , and 130 bombs were dropped from the air , resulting in the deaths of 116 civilians . According to German historian Marie @-@ Janine <unk> , the VRS used ethnic cleansing to break the resistance of the local population and claim the area it termed the " corridor of life " because of its high strategic value . 
 The outcome of the battle shocked the Croatian commander and later resulted in speculation about its cause . Stipetić blamed the 108th Infantry Brigade for the collapse of the Bosanski Brod bridgehead and the failure of the defence . He claimed the brigade had been pulled back from the battlefield by civilian authorities in <unk> Brod and thought the outcome of the battle was predetermined by the Graz agreement of the Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat leaders , Radovan Karadžić and Mate Boban . His view regarding the Graz agreement is echoed by British historian Marko Attila Hoare , who claims that the area conceded by the Croats during Operation Corridor 92 was traded for western Herzegovina . While some sources have proposed that the area was traded for the JNA @-@ held Prevlaka Peninsula near Dubrovnik , a Central Intelligence Agency analysis concluded that there is no direct evidence of such arrangements . 
 Conversely , Croatian historian Davor Marijan concluded that the battle was too complex for the HV and especially for the HVO . He also pointed out that the HV and HVO suffered from ineffective command structures and poor intelligence , noting that they had failed to detect the presence of the VRS 16th Motorised and the 1st Armoured Brigades early on . Marijan also claims the HV had demobilised ten infantry brigades shortly before the battle , and his view is supported by Colonel General <unk> Simić , commander of the VRS 16th Motorised Brigade , assigned to Tactical Group 1 , which had been established by the 1st Krajina Corps to carry out the offensive . 
 In 2001 – 03 , three Bosnian Serb officials were tried by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for war crimes committed after the capture of Bosanski Šamac . The defendants , Blagoje Simić , Miroslav Tadić and Simo <unk> , were charged with unlawful arrest , detention , beatings , torture , forced labour , deportation and forcible transfer . The three were found guilty , and the convictions upheld in the appeals process . Simić was sentenced to 15 years in prison , while Tadić and <unk> received prison terms of eight and six years respectively .

The episode originally aired on NBC in the United States on October 6 , 2011 . The episode guest stars Mark Proksch as Nate and Hugh Dane as Hank the security guard . 
 The series — presented as if it were a real documentary — depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania , branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In the episode , the entire warehouse staff quits after winning the lottery , leaving Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) and Darryl Philbin ( Craig Robinson ) to scramble for replacements while Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) , Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) , Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) , and Kevin Malone ( Brian Baumgartner ) temporarily get a taste of the warehouse life . 
 " Lotto " received mixed reviews from television critics , with many enjoying Andy and Darryl 's interaction .

 = = Plot = = 
 The six warehouse workers win $ 950 @,@ 000 in a lottery pool , and quit in a celebratory fashion of running through the office , making a mess and mooning the staff . Darryl Philbin ( Craig Robinson ) was originally part of the pool but stopped when he was promoted , and falls into a depression , unable to find any motivation to work and further dismayed when his ex @-@ wife 's response to him not winning is to ask for the phone number of his pool @-@ winner friend Glenn . Everyone else speculates how they would spend a hypothetical lottery score , with Jim and Pam ultimately deciding to fuse their two main ideas into one for a lovely brownstone located in the great outdoors . 
 Andy orders Darryl to hire replacements for the warehouse staff , but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to even look at the applications . With an order due out for one of Phyllis Lapin @-@ Vance 's ( Phyllis Smith ) most important clients , Andy asks for volunteers to step in for the day and make sure that the order is shipped out . Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) , Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) , Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) , and Kevin Malone ( Brian Baumgartner ) take over the process , but do not know how to use the heavy @-@ lifting equipment and balk at the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand . Upon Kevin 's suggestion , they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory . They retool Kevin 's idea throughout the day , resulting in still more damaged inventory , and Phyllis ultimately loses the client . 
 A melancholic Darryl finally assembles a conference room meeting with several potential new hires , but utters several discouraging remarks about the job and exits , leaving Andy alone to take charge of the process . Andy does not know what he 's doing and all of the applicants walk out . Darryl blames himself for the failure and demands that Andy fire him , leaving Andy baffled and with no choice but to handle the hiring of new warehouse staff himself . 
 Andy assembles three applicants : a bodybuilder from Oscar Martinez 's ( Oscar Nunez ) gym , Dwight 's building handyman Nate , and a PhD candidate who can only work two days a week . Darryl demands anew to be fired , then switches gears : he tells Andy to give him the manager job , saying he deserves it and wants that or a pink slip . Andy then steps up and bluntly tells Darryl he not only is not going to do that , but Darryl was not even the runner @-@ up to Andy in the selection process . As he brings up Darryl 's short temper , his hiring of the unqualified Glenn , and his loss of interest in taking business education courses , Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him . Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him , and he simply stopped striving after that . He convinces Darryl to stay on board , and Darryl says he will assemble a new warehouse staff using a combination of his picks and one or two of Andy 's applicants .

 = Basingstoke = 
 Basingstoke ( / <unk> / BAY @-@ zing @-@ <unk> ) is the largest town in Hampshire in south central England . It lies across a valley at the source of the River Loddon . It is 30 miles ( 48 km ) northeast of Southampton , 48 miles ( 77 km ) southwest of London , and 19 miles ( 31 km ) northeast of the county town and former capital Winchester . According to the 2011 census the town ( including its outer suburbs ) had a population of 107 @,@ 355 . It is part of the borough of Basingstoke and Deane and part of the parliamentary constituency of Basingstoke . Basingstoke is nicknamed " Doughnut City " or " Roundabout City " because of the number of large roundabouts . 
 Basingstoke is an old market town expanded in the 1960s as a result of an agreement between London and Hampshire County Councils . It developed rapidly after World War II , along with other towns in the United Kingdom , to accommodate part of the London ' overspill ' as perceived in the Greater London Plan in 1944 . Basingstoke market was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 , and remained a small market town until the 1950s . At the start of World War II the population was little more than 13 @,@ 000 . It has a regular market , but is now larger than Hampshire County Council 's definition of a market town . 
 Basingstoke became an important economic centre during the second half of the 20th century . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name Basingstoke ( A.D 990 ; <unk> <unk> , Domesday ; <unk> ) is believed to derived from the town 's position as the outlying , western settlement of <unk> 's people , and the suffix <unk> refers to a stockade ( of which there is now no trace ) that surrounded the settlement in medieval times . Basing , now Old Basing , a village 2 miles ( 3 km ) to the east , is thought to have the same etymology , but is considered to be the older settlement . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early settlements = = = 
 A Neolithic campsite from around 3000 BC beside a spring on the west of the town is the earliest known human settlement in the area , but the Willis Museum has flint implements and axes from nearby fields that date from <unk> times . The hillfort at Winklebury ( 2 miles ( 3 km ) west of the town centre ) , known as Winklebury Camp or Winklebury Ring dates from the Iron age and there are remains of several other earthworks around the town , including a long barrow near Down Grange . The site is now home to Fort Hill Community School . To the west , Roman Road and Kempshott Lane mark the course of a Roman road that ran between Winchester and Silchester . Further to the east , another Roman road from Chichester passes through the villages of Upton Grey and <unk> . The Harrow Way is an Iron @-@ age ancient route to the south of the town . These cross @-@ cutting highways , and good agricultural land led to the establishment of numerous Roman villas in northern Hampshire , the farming enterprises of Romanised native aristocracy ( Roman villa ) . The first recorded historical event here was the victory gained by Æthelred of Wessex and Alfred the Great over the Danes in 871 . In 904 Basingstoke saw a savage battle between Edward the Elder , Alfred 's only son , and his cousin Æthelwald . 
 = = = Market town = = = 
 Basingstoke is recorded as being a market site in the Domesday Book , and has held a regular Wednesday market since 1214 . During the Civil War , and the siege of Basing House between 1643 and 1645 , the town played host to large numbers of Parliamentarians . During this time , St. Michael 's Church was damaged whilst being used as an explosive store and lead was stripped from the roof of the Chapel of the Holy Ghost , leading to its eventual ruin . It had been incorporated in 1524 , but was effectively out of use after the Civil War . The 17th century saw serious damage to much of the town and its churches , because of great fires in 1601 and 1656 . Cromwell is thought to have stayed here towards the end of the siege of Basing House , and wrote a letter to the Speaker of the House of Commons addressed from Basingstoke . 
 The cloth industry was important in the development of the town until the 17th century along with malting . Brewing became important during the 18th and 19th centuries , and the oldest and most successful was May 's Brewery , established by Thomas and William May in 1750 in Brook Street . 
 = = = Victorian history = = = 
 The London and South Western Railway built a line from London in 1839 and within a year it was extended to Winchester and Southampton . In 1848 a rival company , sponsored by the Great Western Railway built a branch from Reading , and in 1854 a line was built to Salisbury . In the 19th century Basingstoke moved into industrial manufacture , Wallis and Haslam ( later Wallis & Steevens ) , began producing agricultural equipment including threshing machines in the 1850s , moving into the production of stationary steam engines in the 1860s and traction engines in the 1870s . 
 Two traders who opened their first shops within a year of each other in the town , became household names nationally : Thomas Burberry in 1856 and Alfred Milward in 1857 . Burberry became famous after he invented gabardine and Milward founded the <unk> chain of shoe shops , which could be found on almost every high street until the 1980s . 
 Ordinary citizens were shocked by the emotive , evangelical tactics of the Salvation Army when it arrived in the town in 1880 , but the reaction from employees of the breweries or the <unk> trade grew openly hostile . Violent clashes became a regular occurrence culminating on Sunday 27 March 1881 with troops being called on after the mayor had read the Riot Act . The riot and its causes led to questions in Parliament and a period of notoriety for the town . The town was described as ' <unk> Basingstoke ' by one London newspaper in 1882 . 
 In 1898 John Isaac Thornycroft began production of steam @-@ powered lorries and Thornycroft 's grew to become the town 's largest employer . 
 = = = Recent history = = = 
 Basingstoke was fortunate during the Second World War to suffer very little bomb damage with mainly a stick of German bombs falling along <unk> Road near to St Michael 's Church . After the war , the town had a population of 25 @,@ 000 . 
 As part of the London <unk> plan , along <unk> places such as Ashford and Swindon , Basingstoke was rapidly developed in the late 1960s as an ' expanded town ' , in similar fashion to Milton Keynes . Many office blocks and large estates were built , including a ring road . The shopping centre was built in phases . The first phase was completed by the 1970s and was later covered in the 1980s , and was known as The Walks . The second phase was completed by the early 1980s , and became The Malls . The third phase was abandoned and the site was later used to build the Anvil concert hall . The central part of the shopping centre was rebuilt in 2002 and reopened as Festival Place . This has brought a dramatic improvement to shoppers ' opinions of the town centre , but it is unclear if it has softened the town 's overall image . 
 Later that year , the Basingstoke Gazette launched its " Basingstoke – A Place to be Proud of " campaign , aimed at changing people 's perception of the town . The campaign is ongoing ( as of September 2014 ) and marked by the presentation of annual awards to individuals , organisations or businesses nominated by the public for commendable local achievement . As a mark of the improving image of the town as place to live , the borough entered the top 50 best places to live in the 2011 Halifax survey at number 47 . 
 Further work to improve the image of the town continues with the latest Central Basingstoke Vision project coordinated by the Borough Council . In the mid @-@ 1990s , numerous reports described sightings of the Beast of Basingstoke , a big cat believed to be a lion or a puma , possibly two . Local legend suggests the animal was shot and killed , although no official news sources document any capture or killing of the beast . 
 Basingstoke houses the UK headquarters of De La Rue , Sun Life Financial , The Automobile Association , ST Ericsson , GAME , Motorola , Barracuda Networks , Eli Lilly and Company , BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions , the leasing arm of BNP Paribas in the UK , and Sony Professional Solutions . It houses the European headquarters of the <unk> @-@ Adidas Golf Company . Other industries include publishing ( Palgrave Macmillan , etc . ) , IT , telecommunications , insurance and electronics . 
 During the severe snow storms of December 2009 , Basingstoke and the surrounding area was one of the worst hit regions in the United Kingdom , where an estimated 3000 motorists were forced to abandon their vehicles around the town and on the ring road during the evening rush hour of the Christmas holidays .

 The precise size and shape of Basingstoke today are difficult to identify , as it has no single official boundary that encompasses all the areas contiguous to its development .

The unparished area includes <unk> which was previously a separate village and parish , extending beyond Roman Road and Old Kempshott Lane , which might otherwise be considered the town 's ' natural ' western extremity . The ward boundaries within the parliamentary constituency are not ( as of August 2007 ) coterminous with the parish boundaries . 
 Basingstoke is situated on a bed of cretaceous upper chalk with small areas of clayey and loamy soil , inset with combined clay and flint patches . Loam and alluvium recent and pleistocene sediments line the bed of the river Loddon . A narrow line of tertiary Reading beds run diagonally from the northwest to the southeast along a line from Sherborne St John through Popley , <unk> and the north part of Basing . To the north of this line , encompassing the areas of Chineham and <unk> Hill , is London clay .

 Basingstoke 's expansion has absorbed much surrounding farmland and scattered housing , transforming it into housing estates or local districts . Many of these new estates are designed as almost self @-@ contained communities , such as <unk> , Chineham , Popley , Winklebury , Oakridge , Kempshott , Brighton Hill , <unk> , South Ham , Black Dam , Buckskin and Hatch Warren . The M3 acts as a buffer zone to the south of the town , and the South Western Main Line constrains the western expansion , with a green belt to the north and north @-@ east , making Basingstoke shaped almost like a kite . As a result , the villages of <unk> , Dummer , Sherborne St John and Oakley , although being very close to the town limits , are considered distinct entities . Popley , Hatch Warren and <unk> are seeing rapid growth in housing .

 The population has increased from around 2 @,@ 500 in 1801 to over 52 @,@ 000 in 1971 ; the most significant growth occurring during the later half of the 20th century . The borough of Basingstoke was merged with other local districts in 1974 to form the borough of Basingstoke and Deane . Since then most census data has been for the larger area : before 1974 , census information was published for the town as a separate entity .

 = = Governance = = 
 Basingstoke is part of a two @-@ tier local government structure and returns county councillors to Hampshire County Council . When the cities of Southampton and Portsmouth attained unitary authority status in 1998 , Basingstoke became the largest settlement in the county administered by the county council , although it remains the third largest settlement in the ceremonial county . 
 Basingstoke and Deane is the local Borough Council and has its offices in the town centre . Elections to the council take place in 3 out of every 4 years . After the latest election in 2012 and 2 Conservative defections thereafter , the council has under no overall control but with a Conservative majority . As of 2014 , the council is compiled of 30 Conservative , 14 Labour , 11 Liberal Democrat , 4 independent and 1 UKIP councillors . The Basingstoke parliamentary constituency was formed under the 1885 Act and is currently served by Conservative Member of Parliament ( MP ) Maria Miller , who was elected in the 2005 general election . In September 2012 , Miller was appointed as Secretary of State for Culture , Media & Sport under the Prime Minister 's cabinet reshuffle , a position from which she resigned in April 2014 . 
 Under the town twinning scheme , the local council have twinned Basingstoke with Alençon in France , Braine @-@ l 'Alleud in Belgium , and <unk> in Germany .

 The former Town Hall , adjoining the old marketplace , houses the Willis Museum ( originally the Basingstoke Museum , until 1956 ) . This was founded and directed by Alderman George W. Willis , a local <unk> , who served as Mayor of Basingstoke in 1923 @-@ 24 . He established the museum in 1931 and with much public support was able to build it up into a major collection on local history , with a particularly extensive collection ( largely made by him ) of prehistoric implements and of antique clocks and watches . His association with the expanding museum continued for forty years . Its central location today is where , once upon a time , Jane Austen and her sister used to go to dances . Although ostensibly set in Hertford , Austen 's novel Pride and Prejudice , written in 1797 , is thought to have been based on her view of Basingstoke society two centuries ago . 
 The Top of Town is the historic heart of Basingstoke , housing the Museum in the former Town Hall building ( rebuilt 1832 ) as well as several locally run shops , the post office , and the market place . Basingstoke is also home to multiple theatrical organisations : The Anvil , and the Haymarket , situated in the former Corn Exchange . 
 Festival Place , opened in October 2002 , gave a huge boost to the town centre whilst transforming the former The Walks Shopping Centre and the New Market Square . Aside from a wide range of shops , there is also a range of cafés and restaurants as well as a large <unk> Vue cinema ( formerly Ster Century from Festival Place 's opening until their takeover in 2005 ; the pre @-@ existing Vue in the Leisure Park was sold to Odeon ) . 
 Central Basingstoke has two further shopping areas : The Malls and the Top of Town . The Malls area had declined since the opening of Festival Place and the closure of its <unk> department store , though still home to several major retailers . The leasehold was purchased in 2004 by the St Modwen development group in partnership with the Kuwait property investment company <unk> Real Estate , with provision for redevelopment The redevelopment of The Malls started in late 2010 , and the shopping centre was given a major facelift . The existing canopies were removed and a clear roof canopy installed , to protect the centre from bad weather , but still allow natural light and air in . The whole shopping centre has been repaved and new street furniture installed . A new gateway entrance to The Malls links it to the rail station . The redevelopment was completed in the last quarter of 2011 . The redevelopment work has been carried out by Wates Group using a variety of subcontractors . 
 Immediately outside the Malls , in the centre of Basingstoke 's <unk> Street stands the most noticeable Willy , the heaviest sculpture of a male organ on public display in the UK , weighing seven tons . The image of a mother and child is carved into the side of the sculpture . 
 The town 's nightlife is split between the new Festival Square , and the traditional <unk> at the Top of Town , with a few local community pubs outside the central area . The town has four nightclubs , two in the town itself , one on the east side and one 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) out to the west . 
 In Portchester Square is the Basingstoke Sports Centre which has a subterranean swimming pool , sauna , jacuzzi and steam room . Above ground there is a gym , aerobics studios , squash courts and main hall . There is also a <unk> for young children . 
 = = = Sports and leisure = = = 
 Outside the town centre , there is a leisure park featuring the <unk> swimming pool , which opened in May 2002 . The park includes an ice rink , bowling alley , Bingo club and a ten screen Odeon ( formerly Vue prior to the takeover of the Ster Century cinema in Festival Place , and before that , Warner @-@ Village ) cinema , as well as a restaurant and fast food outlets . The leisure park is home to the Milestones Museum which contains a network of streets and buildings based on the history of Hampshire . 
 Basingstoke has a football club , Basingstoke Town F.C. the Basingstoke Rugby Football Club , and the Basingstoke Bison ice hockey team . Basingstoke also has a swimming team , known as the Basingstoke <unk> and an American Flag Football Team known as the Basingstoke Zombie Horde . The diversity of sporting activity in the area is also illustrated by organisations such as Basingstoke Demons <unk> Club , Basingstoke Volleyball Club , Basingstoke Bulls <unk> Club and Lasham Gliding Society . The home ground of Basingstoke & North Hants Cricket Club , Mays Bounty was until 2000 used once a season by Hampshire County Cricket Club . As of 2011 , Basingstoke has a roller derby league and team , the Basingstoke Bullets . Due to difficulty finding a suitable venue , the team practice in nearby Whitchurch . 
 Plans have recently been announced for a new multimillion @-@ pound sports facility at Down Grange , which would be suitable for many sports . Proposals include a stadium for Basingstoke Town FC and Basingstoke RFC which would be up to the standard of the Football League , a new 8 lane athletics track and hockey pitch , as well as a gym , swimming pool , hotel and conference facilities . 
 = = = Musical groups = = = 
 Basingstoke has a wide diversity for musical groups ranging from brass bands to symphony orchestras . The Basingstoke Concert Band is a traditional wind band which has now been in existence for more than 35 years . The band was started by Lawrie Shaw when Brighton Hill Community School opened in Basingstoke in 1975 where he was the first headteacher . Lawrie formed the band as an evening class for amateur wind players and it was then known as the Brighton Hill Centre Band . In the years immediately after World War II the Basingstoke Symphony Orchestra was being conducted by D. Cecil Williams .

 In modern times education in Basingstoke has been co @-@ ordinated by Hampshire County Council . Each neighbourhood in the town has at least one primary school , while secondary schools are distributed around the town on larger campuses . Basingstoke has two large further education colleges : a sixth form college , Queen Mary 's College ( <unk> ) and Basingstoke College of Technology ( <unk> ) . The University of Winchester had a campus in Basingstoke ( Chute House Campus ) which closed in July 2011 ; it had offered full @-@ time and part @-@ time university courses in subjects including childhood studies , various management pathways , community development and creative industries . Bournemouth University 's health and social care students can work on placement at the North Hampshire Hospital . However , the hospital only caters for midwifery students .

 Basingstoke is at Junction 6 and Junction 7 of the M3 motorway , which skirts the town 's southeastern edge , linking the town to London and to Southampton and the south @-@ west . The central area of the town is encircled by a ring road constructed in the 1960s named The Ringway and bisected from east to west either by the <unk> or Churchill Way . The A33 runs north east to Reading and the M4 Motorway and south west to Winchester . The A30 runs east to Hook and west to Salisbury . The A303 begins a few miles south west of Basingstoke to head west towards Wiltshire and the West Country , sharing the first few miles with the A30 . The A339 runs south east to Alton and north west to Newbury . Basingstoke has a reputation for having a large density of roundabouts , and with some larger roundabouts dealing with traffic from six directions , this only adds to the illusion , as does the fact some multilevel junctions on the Ringway were never built or completed . 
 The South Western Main Line railway runs east and west through the centre of the town and Basingstoke railway station linking it to the West of England Main Line to Salisbury and the South West of England , London Waterloo ( the fastest train Basingstoke to London takes 44 minutes ) , Winchester , Southampton , Bournemouth and Weymouth , and via the Eastleigh to Fareham Line and West Coastway Line to Portsmouth and Brighton . The West of England Main Line to Salisbury and Exeter diverges at <unk> Junction , to the west . The Basingstoke Branch runs north @-@ east to Reading , providing services to Oxford , Birmingham , the north of England and Scotland . The town was the terminus of the defunct Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway . Current rail services from Basingstoke are operated by South West Trains , CrossCountry and First Great Western . 
 Most bus services in the town operate from Basingstoke Bus Station . The majority are provided by the Stagecoach Group through their Stagecoach in Hampshire sub @-@ division , Newbury and District also operate over individual routes and <unk> operate a service linking villages between Basingstoke and Alton . A Park and Ride service links Basingstoke leisure park with Basing View , via Basingstoke Railway Station . This service provides a daytime service at roughly 10 @-@ minute intervals throughout the week . The buses on this service being provided by Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council . Currently ( 2010 ) , a complementary peak time service is also provided by Courtney Coaches Limited between Chineham Business Park and the railway station . National Express offers direct coach services to London , Heathrow Airport and Southampton from the bus station . 
 Separating provision for cyclists from other road traffic was not part of the remit of the 1960s town redevelopment , and in 1996 the perception of provision for cyclists was very poor . A Basingstoke Area Cycling Strategy was developed in 1999 and subsequently an extensive cycle network has been developed mainly utilising on @-@ road routes or off @-@ road routes that run parallel with and directly alongside roads . Basingstoke was linked to Reading on the National Cycle Network route 23 in May 2003 and the route was extended south to Alton and Alresford in April 2006 . 
 = = = Basingstoke Canal = = = 
 The Basingstoke Canal started at a canal basin , roughly where the cinema in Festival Place is located . From there the canal ran alongside the River Loddon following the line of <unk> Way . The old canal route passes under the perimeter ring road and then follows a long loop partly on an embankment to pass over small streams and water meadows towards Old Basing , where the route goes around the now ruined palace of Basing House and then through and around the eastern edge of Old Basing . It followed another loop to go over small streams near the Hatch public house ( a lot of this section was built over when constructing the M3 ) and headed across fields on an embankment towards <unk> . The section of the canal from Up <unk> to the western entrance of the Greywell Tunnel still exists and is a nature reserve ; there is water in the canal and the canal towpath can be walked . A permissive footpath at the western entrance to the tunnel allows walkers to access public footpaths to get to the eastern entrance of the tunnel . The limit of navigation is about 500m east of the Greywell Tunnel . The renovated sections of the canal can then be navigated east towards West Byfleet where it joins the Wey Navigation , which itself can be navigated to the River Thames at Weybridge . 
 Plans to reconnect Basingstoke with the surviving sections of the Canal have been delayed several times in the past and this remains a long term aim of the Surrey and Hampshire Canal Society .

 The notable Anglican church of St. Michael 's is west of Festival Place and the chancel dates from 1464 ; the south chapel may be older . The nave and aisles were added 50 years later by Richard Foxe , Bishop of Winchester . The Memorial Chapel at the north east corner of the church was completed in 1921 . The ruined Chapel of the Holy Ghost , north of the railway station , has not been a place of worship for the past four centuries , an effect of the Reformation . It was built by the first Lord Sandys , beginning in 1524 , when King Henry VIII issued a charter of incorporation . However the west tower of a 13th @-@ century building survives . It is surrounded by an ancient cemetery ; Lord William Sandys himself lies buried in the chapel with his wife . According to the authors of Premature burial and how it may be prevented , a lady by the name of <unk> was buried alive in this cemetery by accident in a family vault . Schoolboys were supposed to have heard her struggles in her coffin , which was opened too late to save her life . The Church of St Mary , <unk> is an old church enlarged in 1912 . All Saints ' Church was built in 1915 , designed by Temple Moore . St Peter 's Church was built in 1964 @-@ 5 designed by Ronald Sims and is in a housing estate built in the 1960s . In 2014 a group named Basingstoke Community Churches covered an area of six churches in the town . There is also an Assemblies of God church called Wessex Christian Fellowship , two very new Roman Catholic churches , St. Bede 's and St. Joseph 's , and churches of other denominations .

 The Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera Ruddigore uses the word " Basingstoke " as a <unk> , reminding the " mad " character Margaret not to relapse into abnormal behaviour . In 1895 , Thomas Hardy referred to Basingstoke as " Stoke <unk> " in Jude the Obscure . Patrick Wilde 's 1993 play , What 's Wrong with Angry ? is set in Basingstoke . It was later adapted into the 1998 film , Get Real , which was filmed at various locations around Basingstoke .

 Basingstoke 's North Hampshire Hospital was one of two hospitals used for the filming of Channel 4 's hit comedy Green Wing . George Formby 's film , " He Snoops to Conquer , " was partly shot in the town in 1944 .

 = You Can Dance = 
 You Can Dance is the first remix album by American singer @-@ songwriter Madonna . It was released on November 17 , 1987 , by Sire Records . The album contains remixes of tracks from her first three studio albums — Madonna ( 1983 ) , Like a Virgin ( 1984 ) and True Blue ( 1986 ) — and a new track , " Spotlight " . In the 1980s , remixing was still a new concept and technology , by which a particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied , repeated , chopped up , transposed up and down in pitch and give them more echo , reverberation , treble or bass . Madonna became interested in the concept , noting that she hated when others remixed her songs and wanted to do it by herself . 
 Madonna turned to her old friend and producer John " Jellybean " Benitez to help her remix the songs , and also enlisted the help of Patrick Leonard , the producer of True Blue . The mixes on You Can Dance exhibited a number of typical mixing techniques . Instrumental passages were lengthened to increase the time for dancing , which undermined the tighter structure of the original pop song . Vocal phrases were repeated and subjected to multiple echoes , panned across the stereophonic sound outlets . At certain points , almost no music is heard except the drums and at other times , the drums are removed with only the hi @-@ hat left to keep time . The album cover denoted Madonna 's continuous fascination with Hispanic culture . 
 After its release , You Can Dance received generally mixed reviews from critics , some of whom noted how the already known songs appeared to them in a complete new structure , calling it an essential album to be played at parties . You Can Dance was a commercial success , earning a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) for shipment of a million copies , and reaching the top twenty of the Billboard 200 . It reached the top ten of the album charts of France , Italy , Japan , Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway and the United Kingdom , and went on to sell five million copies worldwide , making it the second best @-@ selling remix album of all time , behind only Blood on the Dance Floor from Michael Jackson . " Spotlight " was the only single released from the album in Japan , but charted on the airplay charts of Billboard due to radio play .

 In November 1987 , Warner Bros. Records commissioned the release of You Can Dance — Madonna 's first retrospective — which was aimed at the dance segment of her audience . It was an album containing seven of Madonna 's songs in remixed format , which was still a revolutionary concept in the 1980s . By the mid @-@ eighties , post @-@ disco dance music was extremely popular and the concept of remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music . Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums . Mixing was an interpretative process , where the artist was usually involved , but the development was generally looked after the record producer . The different parts of a song , including the lead vocals , background vocals , guitars , bass , synths , drum machine — all went through the process of mixing to sound considerably different from their original counterpart . Mixing determined how loud these instruments were going to sound in relation to each other and what particular sound effects should be added to each instrument . Improvements in studio technologies meant the possibility of shaping the sound of a song in any way , after it has been recorded . The arrangements were itself created at the mixing stage , rather than being created previously . A particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied , repeated , chopped up , transposed up and down in pitch and give them more echo , reverberation , treble or bass . 
 It was this concept which intrigued Madonna , while she was developing her third studio album True Blue ( 1986 ) . She said , " I hate it when people do master mixes of my records . I don 't want to hear my songs changed like that . I don 't know that I like it , people screwing with my records . The jury is out on it for me . But the fans like it , and really , this one was for the fans , for the kids in the clubs who wanted to hear these songs in a fresh new way . " She went to Warner with the idea of releasing her songs by remixing them in a complete dance tune . From Warner 's point of view , the rise of remix was a commercial boon , because it meant making more money out of the same piece of music . Instead of paying Madonna to go to studio and record different tracks , they found that allowing her to record the same tracks in different formats was much less costly . Hence they decided to release the album , but gave full freedom to Madonna to choose the producers with whom she wanted to develop the remixes . 
 = = Development = = 
 Madonna turned to her old friend and producer John " Jellybean " Benitez to help her remixing the songs , and also enlisted the help of Patrick Leonard , the producer of True Blue . Together they chose six of Madonna 's old songs and decided to give it a remixed form . The songs chosen were " Holiday " , " Everybody " and " Physical Attraction " from Madonna ( 1983 ) , " Into the Groove " and " Over and Over " from Like a Virgin ( 1984 ) , and lastly , " Where 's the Party " from True Blue . Along with the pre @-@ released tracks , a never @-@ before released song called " Spotlight " was included as a bonus . Madonna said that she was inspired by the song " Everybody Is a Star " ( 1970 ) , by American rock band Sly and the Family Stone . Written by Madonna , Stephen Bray and Curtis Hudson , " Spotlight " was originally recorded during the True Blue recording sessions . It was omitted from the album because Madonna felt that it was similar in composition and structure to " Holiday " . 
 After the remixing of the songs started , Benitez noted , " We decided on basic questions like ' How loud should the drums be ? How much should the vocals stand out ? ' These are creative decisions which will change the finished piece of music . " Shep Pettibone , one of the producers of the album commented that " normally , without some music to work on , the remixer has nothing . But we already had Madonna 's catalogue of danceable songs which was enough material for lifetime . " The mixes on You Can Dance exhibited a number of typical mixing techniques . Instrumental passages were lengthened to increase the time for dancing , which undermined the tighter structure of the original pop song . Vocal phrases were repeated and subjected to multiple echoes , panned across the stereophonic sound outlets . At certain points , almost no music is heard except the drums and at others , the drums are removed with only the hi @-@ hat left to keep time . 
 The album cover denoted Madonna 's continued fascination with Spanish culture and fashion . She wore a female toreador outfit with a lacy bustier , embroidered bolero jacket and a <unk> with a <unk> bustle . Jeri Heiden , who had worked on the cover art for True Blue , was given the task of editing the photos and making them compatible for appearance in an album cover . Shot by Herb Ritts , the cover showed Madonna again as a platinum blond . Heiden explained in an interview with Aperture magazine in October 2006 that the cover was not meant to be a tie @-@ in with the True Blue cover . " It was just Madonna 's look at the time – Platinum Blond . And of course the handwriting reappears on that album . " The album sleeve included a free poster and the gold wrap @-@ around liner notes contained approximate running time to indicate the difference between the length of the remix and the original track . Brian Chin , a Rolling Stone journalist , wrote the liner notes for the album , explaining the process of remix and why the seven songs were chosen for the tracklist . 
 = = Composition = = 
 According to Rikky Rooksby , author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna , " Improvements in studio technology meant that possibilities for shaping the sound after it has been recorded are almost limitless . " Such possibility were applied in the song composition and the remixes present in You Can Dance . Previously to change the sound of an instrument , or to jump from one sound to another , recordings used to stop playing the instrument and the drums at that point . But for the remixes on You Can Dance , the fade engineering technology was applied to the songs , wherein the <unk> was simply pulled down , and was pushed up again when the sound of the instruments were made to come up to the surface . The first song on the album is " Spotlight " which begins with the sound of drums , bass synths and handclaps , followed by Madonna uttering the words " Spotlight , shine bright " . After the first verse , the sound of keyboard is heard during the chorus . It continues like this through the second verse , which is followed by an interlude featuring vocal echoes , a piano segment and violin phrases . Madonna follows the music played by the piano and utters the words " Pa @-@ da @-@ pa @-@ da @-@ pappa pappa pa pa " in the same melody . The lyrics deal with Madonna making the listener remember that " everybody is a star " and that if one wants to be famous and be under the " spotlight " , the person should sing about it and reality may catch up with him or her . According to the sheet music published at <unk> , the song is set in the time signature of common time , with a tempo of 100 beats per minute . It is set in the key of F major with Madonna 's voice spanning from the notes of C5 to B ♭ 5 . " Spotlight " has a basic sequence of Am – C – Am – C – G – F as its chord progression . 
 The second track is " Holiday " , which Benitez said that he always wanted to remix , commenting " There are new sounds on the 1987 remix [ of ' Holiday ' ] , but it had a groove that needed no improvement . " The sound of the guitar is brought to the front in the remix , with a piano break and a middle section consisting of drum beats . The mix for " Everybody " starts with four repetitions of the vocal hook and then moves into a rhythm centered arrangement . Like " Holiday " , the middle section of " Everybody " features a drum break , with a synth tune backing it up . The word " dance " is echoed and slowed @-@ down continuously through the break , gradually changing into the intermedia verse . At the very end , the drums are pulled out , leaving Madonna repeating the " get up and do your thing " phrase , which hovers over to the intro of the next song " Physical Attraction " . It begins with the arrangement of the original song , until the middle eight , where the composition is varied . A disconcerting sound is present at the end of the track , which , after sometime increases in volume until then next track " Over and Over " begins . In the " Into the Groove " remix , overdubs are present with the continuous repetition of the phrase " c 'mon " . The first verse does not start until about ninety seconds into the remix . After the first " Now I know you 're mine " line is sung , there is a percussion break , and repetition of the phrases " step to the beat " and " c 'mon " . The last verse incorporates echoing on the vocals , causing overlap of the phrases . The remix ends with instrumentation from congas , whistles and timbales , giving it a Mexican ending .

 Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that " [ You Can Dance ] keeps the spotlight on her first record , adding non @-@ LP singles like ' Into the Groove ' for good measure , along with a bonus track of ' Where 's the Party ' . Since it is a dance album , it doesn 't matter that ' Holiday ' and ' Into the Groove ' are here twice , once each in dub versions , because the essential grooves and music are quite different in each incarnation . It is true that some of this now sounds dated — these are quite clearly extended mixes from the mid 80s — but that 's part of its charm , and it all holds together quite well . Not essential , but fun . " In The Village Voice , Robert Christgau considered that " the effects , repeats , breaks , and segues added by a star crew of remixers [ ... ] amount to new music — this time the songs don 't surface , they reach out and grab you " . He also argued that You Can Dance reminded the audience that before MTV , they " loved the way she sounded " . Author J. Randy Taraborrelli noted that " You Can Dance made one point clear about Madonna . While she was evolving into a serious pop star , musically she still knew how to host the best party . " He complimented the remixed versions of " Holiday " , " Everybody " , " Physical Attraction " and " Into the Groove " . 
 Timothy Green from The Miami Herald said that " [ The album has ] got a good beat and you can dance to it . Madonna 's new album isn 't really new , but rather a collection of danceable hits , remixed by club deejays masterful at that peculiar art of taking the artists ' work , track by track , and reconstructing it . Most such remixes become 12 @-@ inch dance singles , and You Can Dance , is basically a compilation of these . The remixes sound fresh and gives a new outlook on the already famous and popular songs . " Jan DeKnock from the Chicago Tribune was not impressed with the album , calling it <unk> . However , Daniel Brogan from the same newspaper praised the album , saying that " Madonna has brought a new joy to the people buying gifts for Christmas , as You Can Dance is a fun @-@ filled , fast @-@ paced retrospective that will burn the dance floor till New Year . " Richard Harrington from The Washington Post called the album " an energetic collection of extended dance remixes , that will surely be the highlight of the party crowds flocking around the town . " John Milward from USA Today felt that " although the remixes sound a little exhaustive , its nevertheless party time with Madonna 's album . "

 " Spotlight " was released as the only single from the album in Japan on April 25 , 1988 . Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times commented that " Spotlight " was " lost in the dazzling collection of the extended remixes of her best dance tunes . " " Spotlight " was not officially released as a single in the United States , therefore it was not eligible at the time to appear on Billboard 's Hot 100 . Even so , radio stations started to play the song unofficially and it managed to garner enough airplay to appear on the Hot 100 Airplay chart of Billboard in early 1988 . It debuted on the Airplay chart at 37 on the issue dated January 16 , 1988 , and was the highest debut of the week .

 = Ashton Court Festival = 
 The Ashton Court Festival was an outdoor music festival held annually in mid @-@ July on the grounds of Ashton Court , just outside Bristol , England . The festival was a weekend event which featured a variety of local bands and national headliners . Mainly aimed at local residents , the festival did not have overnight camping facilities and was financed by donations and benefit gigs . 
 Starting as a small one @-@ day festival in 1974 , the festival grew during succeeding years and was said to be Britain 's largest free festival until changes brought on by government legislation resulted in compulsory fees and security fencing being introduced . After problems were caused by a temporary move to Hengrove Park in 2001 , due to the foot and mouth crisis , and a washout in 2007 , the organisers declared bankruptcy in 2007 .

 The first festival was held in 1974 , organised by Royce <unk> and friends , as a small event , for the local musicians to entertain the local community . The first festival took place over four successive weekends with bands playing from a stage improvised from a flat bed truck . Bristol City Council donated £ 50 . The following year the festival took place over one weekend and was located near to Ashton Court mansion . After this , new organisers came on board and fund @-@ raising gigs were held enabling the event to grow steadily through the 1970s . 
 = = = 1980 = = = 
 In 1980 , large numbers of people from far afield attended , trees were damaged and burnt and there was illegal camping and lurid press reports of drugs and nudity . It was not until 1983 that the festival <unk> when it was a one @-@ day event ; in 1984 a de facto two @-@ day event was created by staging it back @-@ to @-@ back with a one @-@ day WOMAD event . The festival took place in a large sloped clearing surrounded on three sides by New Barn Wood and <unk> Coombe . The main stage was placed at the bottom of the slope and the second stage in a natural amphitheatre near the entrance to the clearing . There were many other performance spaces , varying from year to year , including a dance tent , marquees for world music , acoustic acts and performing arts , and the " Blackout " tent for experimental music and video , as well as a children 's area and funfair rides . Camping on the festival site was not allowed .

 In 2001 the Bristol Community Festival temporarily relocated to Hengrove Park in the south of the city . Ashton Court Estate , which includes a deer park , was closed as a quarantine measure due to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease that affected the United Kingdom that year . The move caused a massive drop in attendance and a heavy financial loss , leading to debts which hung over the organisation . This , along with changes to licensing laws and tightening health and safety requirements , led to a more commercial style of organisation , with a compulsory entrance fee and a strict security presence around the perimeter fence . This attracted criticism from some locals who felt that the " community " nature of the festival had been lost . Even so , the festival continued to be run by volunteers on a not @-@ for @-@ profit basis . 
 In 2003 the weight and vibrations of crowds returning from the Ashton Court Festival and the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta put such a great strain on the Clifton Suspension Bridge that the Bridge Trustees decided to close the bridge to all traffic , including pedestrians , for the entirety of the festival and most of the Balloon Fiesta in 2004 and 2005 . 
 = = = Crisis = = = 
 In December 2006 it was announced that the festival was in financial crisis and there was uncertainty over whether the 2007 event would take place . The festival planning went ahead with support and donations from a number of Bristol businesses . In June 2007 it was announced that alcohol would not be allowed to be taken on site , but would be available to purchase from official bars within the arena . Also , that everyone attending the festival would be searched on the way in . This announcement caused much controversy . 
 Although locals have long referred to the festival as the " Ashton Court Festival " , before 2004 it was officially called the Bristol Community Festival . Since then it became increasingly popular , and for several years it was claimed to be Britain 's biggest free festival ; however , the " suggested minimum donation " for entry become a gradually increasing compulsory entry fee . From 2007 , children ( aged 10 – 16 ) also had to pay an entry fee , while under 10s remained free ( previously all children got in free ) , and a new discounted weekend ticket became available . The festival was typically attended by over 60 @,@ 000 people annually . 
 In the festival 's last year , 2007 , the site was moved to Smythe 's field in front of Ashton Court Mansion . On the second day , the event was cancelled due to torrential rain , which made the site inaccessible to emergency vehicles . " The health and safety of our audience is what is important , " said organiser Steve Hunt . Over 80 bands were due to perform that day , including Damon Albarn 's The Good , the Bad and the Queen . The cancellation increased the pressure on the already strained finances of the festival . On Friday 20 July 2007 Bristol Community Festival Ltd , the not @-@ for @-@ profit company which organised the event , announced that it had started the process of winding up the company due to unsustainable financial losses .

 Following the end of Bristol Community Festival , other groups emerged hoping to continue with some sort of summer festival in Bristol . Bristol Music Festival became the Bristol Festival ( now <unk> ) and has so far successfully put on four summer festivals , albeit in the city centre . 2011 saw the most successful even yet , with over 25 @,@ 000 people attending over three days . 
 <unk> returned to Ashton Court in 2012 and 2013 , however announced in December 2013 that they would not be continuing the festival into 2014 . 
 The event returned in 2015 and 2016 as part of the " Let 's Rock Bristol " retro festival . 
 = St Denys ' Church , Sleaford = 
 St Denys ' Church , Sleaford , is a medieval parish church in Sleaford , Lincolnshire , England . While a church and a priest are likely to have been present in the settlement since approximately 1086 , the oldest parts of the present building are the tower and spire . The tower and spire can be dated to the late 12th and early 13th centuries ; the stone broach spire is one of the earliest examples of its kind in England . The Decorated Gothic nave , aisles and north transept were built in the 14th century . The church was altered in the 19th century : the north aisle was rebuilt by the local builders Kirk and Parry in 1853 and the tower and spire were largely rebuilt in 1884 after being struck by lightning . St Denys ' remains in use for worship by the Church of England . 
 The church is a Grade I listed building , a national designation given to " buildings of exceptional interest " . The architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner stated it is " remembered for the flowing tracery of its windows " . Built out of Ancaster stone with a lead roof , St Denys ' is furnished with a medieval rood screen and a communion rail , possibly by Sir Christopher Wren , and has a peal of eight bells , dating to 1796 . The church also houses several memorials , including two altar tombs commemorating members of the Carre family , Sleaford 's Lords of the Manor in the 17th century . 
 = = Description = = 
 St Denys ' Church is the parish church of the benefice of Sleaford ( formerly called New Sleaford ) , which encompasses most of the market town of Sleaford in the English non @-@ metropolitan county of Lincolnshire . The benefice is a vicarage and falls within the deanery of Lafford and the archdeaconry and diocese of Lincoln ; as of 2015 , the vicar is Rev. Philip Anthony Johnson , who was appointed in 2013 . The church is located next to ( and faces onto ) the market place at the town centre . It is dedicated to St Denys ; the Victorian clergyman and local historian Edward Trollope stated that this is a medieval form of St Dionysius , but does not elaborate on which of the several saints called Dionysius this refers to . According to a pamphlet published by the parochial church council , St Denys is a medieval composite of Dionysius of Paris , Dionysius the Areopagite and Pseudo @-@ Dionysius the Areopagite . 
 As of 2015 , regular church services are scheduled for Sundays and Wednesdays . Holy Communion is conducted weekly at 8 : 00am on Sundays , followed by Sunday School and an all @-@ age family worship at 10 : 00am . A parent and toddler group is scheduled for Wednesdays at 9 : 30am . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background and origins = = = 
 The Sleaford area has been inhabited since the late Iron Age ; people settled around the ford where a prehistoric track running northwards from Bourne crossed the River Slea . A large hoard of coin moulds belonging to the Corieltauvi tribe have been uncovered in this area and dated to the late Iron Age . It was occupied by the Romans , and then by the Anglo @-@ Saxons . The place @-@ name <unk> first appears in 852 , meaning " crossing over a muddy stream " , in reference to the Slea . The settlement around the crossing came to be known as " Old " Sleaford in 13th @-@ century sources to distinguish it from developments further west , around the present @-@ day market place , which came to be known as " New " Sleaford . The origins of New Sleaford are not clear , leading to a theory that it was planted by the Bishop of Lincoln in the 12th century as a means of increasing his income , hence the epithet " New " . The town 's compass @-@ point layout , the 12th @-@ century date of St Denys ' stonework and other topographical features offer evidence for this theory . 
 A speculative reassessment of Domesday Book ( 1086 ) material suggests that St Denys ' origins may be earlier . Two manors called Eslaforde ( Sleaford ) were recorded in the Domesday Book , one held by Remigius , Bishop of Lincoln , the other by Ramsey Abbey . The Bishop succeeded a Saxon thegn , Bardi , and held 11 carucates with 29 villeins , 11 bordars , 6 <unk> , a church and priest , as well as 8 mills , 1 acre of woodland , 320 acres ( 130 ha ) of meadow and 330 acres ( 130 ha ) of marsh . Ramsey Abbey had been granted land in Sleaford and surrounding villages before the Norman Conquest of England ; in Domesday its fee consisted of 1 carucate , 1 <unk> , 2 villeins and 27 acres of meadow . It was sokeland of the abbot of Ramsey 's manor of Quarrington , where he held two churches . There is no evidence for a second church at Quarrington , which suggests that the record is alluding to one in another of the abbot 's manors for which Quarrington was an estate centre . The local historians David Roffe and Christine Mahany ruled out the possibility that this referred to Cranwell , another of the abbey 's fees , and concluded that it is probably a reference to the church at Old Sleaford , which was granted by a knight of Ramsey to Haverholme Priory in c . 1165 . Hence , the church possessed by the bishop in the other manor must have been a second church in Sleaford , and therefore could only have been St Denys ' in what would become New Sleaford . 
 = = = Expansion = = = 
 Sleaford and its church were altered considerably in the 12th century , especially under Bishop Alexander of Lincoln ; a castle was constructed to the west of the town during his episcopate and work on the earliest surviving parts of the church may date to this period . Facing onto the market place , the tower is the oldest part of the present church building and dates to the late 12th century , probably c . 1180 . Its broach spire has been dated to the early 13th century , possibly c . 1220 . A prebendary of Sleaford is recorded in the late 13th century whose office was probably founded by one of the post @-@ Conquest Bishops , who were its patrons . The vicarage of Sleaford was founded and endowed in 1274 ; the record has survived and shows Henry de <unk> being presented to the vicarage by the Treasurer of Lincoln and Prebendary of Sleaford , Richard de Belleau ; the Bishop instituted him that March . The vicar could profit from tithes and oblations , and was given a house formerly occupied by one Roger the chaplain , but he had to pay £ 15 to the prebendary at the feasts of the Nativity and St John the Baptist . The prebendary otherwise retained his jurisdiction over the parish . 
 A period of rebuilding and remodelling occurred in the late Middle Ages . A chantry chapel , dedicated to the Virgin Mary , was founded in 1271 by the merchants Thomas Blount and John de <unk> , who endowed it with lands around Old and New Sleaford , and several surrounding villages . The chapel is located on the north aisle , and the chaplain was instructed to pray there for the founders at his daily mass . The chantry priest 's house is recorded in the 1440s as one of the oldest buildings in Sleaford ; located in the churchyard , it became the Vicarage . The tower was probably accompanied by a nave of a similar date , which was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style in the mid to late 14th century ; the transept followed twenty or thirty years later , according to Trollope . A clerestory was added in around 1430 and the chancel was remodelled at this time . 
 = = = Early modern and later = = = 
 A diocesan return of 1563 recorded 145 households in the parish of New Sleaford , while the Compton Census ( 1676 ) reveals that New Sleaford had a <unk> population of 576 people , no " Papists " , and 6 Non @-@ conformists . There is a widely held local tradition that St Denys ' was used during the English Civil War ( 1642 – 51 ) as a barracks for parliamentary troops who destroyed the interior furnishings . The local historian Trollope stated that the soldiers looted the brass eagle lectern ( last recorded in 1622 ) , broke the stained glass windows and the organ , and stole valuables . Whether this damage occurred or not , repairs to the windows and roof were carried out in 1657 , paid for by public subscription . Galleries were also added to the church in the 18th century : the south in 1758 , west in 1772 , and north in 1783 – 84 . In 1772 , Edward Evans , a ship 's surgeon on HMS Egmont , donated £ 300 to replace the organ with one built by Samuel Green of London . 
 For most of the 19th century , the Anglican community dominated Sleaford 's civic bodies , including the Board of Guardians , who oversaw the workhouse , and the Local Board of Health . Dr Richard Yerburgh and his son , Richard , were vicars in 1809 – 51 and 1851 – 82 respectively and had family connections with the local builders Kirk and Parry ; Yerburgh and Thomas Parry ( one half of the firm ) were on the Board of Guardians and were labelled members of a " family party " by opponents during the Board 's 1870 elections ( they were nonetheless re @-@ elected ) . They and other local clergymen were key players in the establishment of National schools in Sleaford and Quarrington , which Kirk and Parry built . The Anglican congregation , at an estimated 700 to 800 people in 1851 ( St Denys ' had enough space for 743 people ) , was less than half of the size of the nonconformist community , which was probably larger than 2 @,@ 000 and tended to flourish in poorer parts of the town . 
 The 19th century also witnessed two major restorations to St Denys ' . As the congregation expanded , the need for greater space was met with the addition of a new north aisle in 1853 . This coincided with a wider restoration project carried out at the cost of £ 3 @,@ 500 by Kirk and Parry , which included the demolition of the galleries , the addition of a strainer arch and the relocation of the organ . The church was damaged by an electrical storm in 1884 and parts , including the stone broach spire — one of the oldest in England — were rebuilt by Kirk and Parry in 1885 – 86 . The old organ was sold in 1891 and St Hugh 's Chapel and the choir vestry were dedicated to the memory of a local solicitor , Henry Snow , in 1906 . Electric lighting was introduced in 1951 – 53 and extensive restoration work was carried out in 1966 , when the organ was rebuilt , and in 1988 . Fifty @-@ four solar panels were added in 2008 , at the cost of £ 70 @,@ 000 , and by 2011 were able to cover the church 's electricity bill . 
 = = Architecture , fittings and grounds = = 
 St Denys ' is constructed in Ancaster stone across four periods : the earliest sections in a transitional style between Early English Gothic and Decorated Gothic ; the late medieval nave , aisles and chancel in Decorated Gothic ; the later Perpendicular Gothic clerestory and chancel ; and the Victorian neo @-@ Gothic restorations . The earliest parts consist of the late 12th or early 13th @-@ century tower and spire on the west side of the church , which have a combined height of 144 feet ( 44 m ) . Its arched entrance exhibits features of both the Early English and Decorated Gothic styles . During the restoration , a 15th @-@ century window was removed , placed in the churchyard and replaced by arcading and three circlets , deemed " somewhat absurd " by the architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner . 
 With the exception of the tower and spire , much of the church was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style during the late 14th century . The nave and aisles extend eastwards from the tower . Outside , parts of the aisles are highly decorated ; the north doorway includes shafts , mouldings and finials , while the simpler south doorway has niches and monster carvings . The northern doorway has a gable which encroaches up into a five @-@ light window . Pevsner remarks that St Denys ' is particularly notable for its tracery , and the building 's entry on the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest notes " particularly good mid [ 14th @-@ century ] tracery and ornament " . The window above the north doorway is a good example ; it contains elements shared by others of the Decorated style around the church , including reticulated ogee arches of varying complexity . A Perpendicular clerestory adorns the aisles with three @-@ light windows ; it dates to the early 15th century , possibly c . 1430 . The north aisle was extended in 1853 , but the architects , Kirk and Parry , reused the windows . The north transept includes a six @-@ light window — " one of the great flowing designs of the country " , according to Pevsner . Simon Jenkins , in his 2012 England 's Thousand Best Churches , awards St Denys three stars and says of the window tracery : " This is Lincolnshire at its most curvaceous , best displayed in the north transept north window . Words can barely do justice to this work ... This is a work of infinite complexity , with variations repeated throughout the church . " 
 The tower ceiling has a tierceron vault and is connected to the nave and aisles by arches . The nave 's arcading spans four bays , the last of which on the north side acts as an entrance to the transept . The north aisle was extended in 1853 by Kirk and Parry , who added a strainer arch to support the tower and join it with the north aisle . The reredos and altar were built in 1922 by L.T. Moore ; the rood screen was restored by Ninian Comper in 1918 and the Communion rail was taken from Lincoln Cathedral during a restoration ; it has been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren , but Pevsner makes no mention of this . The rood loft is also by Comper , who is described by Simon Jenkins as " inventive as ever . His wood is unusually dark and unpainted , as are the rood figures and angels . The loft blooms out over the crossing . " The screen and altar rails in St Hugh 's Chapel are the work of C.H. Fowler ; E. Stanley Watkins completed the reredos in 1906 . In the 1640s , the stained glass included the armorial bearings of Sir William Hussey impaling his wife 's Barkley arms , and the arms of Markham and John Russell , Bishop of Lincoln . These have not survived , but the current stained glass includes a " very Gothic " window by Hardman dating to c . 1853 , three by Holland of Warwick from the late 1880s , one of Ward and Hughes ( 1885 ) and one by Morris & Co. from 1900 . In 2006 Glenn Carter completed a stained glass window dedicated to Yvonne Double which had been commissioned by her widower , Eddy Double . 
 The earliest peal recorded at St Denys ' had six bells : three dating from 1600 , one from 1707 and two undated . In 1796 a new peal of eight bells were cast by Thomas Osborn of Downham , Norfolk ; the tenor is in the E key and weighs 19 long cwt 3 qr 6 lb ( 2 @,@ 218 lb or 1 @,@ 006 kg ) . Samuel Green 's organ of 1772 was rebuilt by <unk> in 1852 and replaced by the present organ in 1891 , which was built by Forster and Andrews of Hull ; rebuilt by Harrison & Harrison in 1966 , it was restored by A. Carter in 1999 and has three manuals and a pedalboard . St Hugh 's Chapel has its own organ , with one manual , installed by <unk> and Sons in 1912 . The church also houses a collection of fifteen antique , chained books in an oak reading desk ; the oldest items date to the early 17th century and include tracts on divinity . Other items of furniture include two old chests and a dole cupboard , while a 16th @-@ century tapestry is in the church 's possession . The octagonal font is in a Decorated Gothic style , but has been altered considerably . 
 The churchyard around St Denys ' has been expanded several times : first in 1391 , when the Bishop of Lincoln , John <unk> , was granted a piece of land 150 by 8 feet ( 45 @.@ 7 m × 2 @.@ 4 m ) to one side of the church . Land to the north was also added in 1796 . The grounds were enclosed by a dwarf wall , which was replaced by a more substantial stone wall and iron fence in 1837 ; the railings were removed during the First World War . In a report on the town 's health in 1850 , William Ranger criticised the overcrowding of the churchyard ; in 1855 , burials in the grounds ceased and the vestry elected a burial board to produce a solution . They purchased 2 acres , 3 roods and 31 poles ( 0 @.@ 92 ha ) of land to the north of Eastgate at a cost of £ 1 @,@ 500 ; this was converted into a cemetery and a further 2 roods and 17 poles ( 0 @.@ 063 ha ) were bought for an access road . These grounds were extended in 1862 by an acquisition of 3 acres and 39 poles ( 1 @.@ 51 ha ) of land to the west of the cemetery ; they are now managed by Sleaford Town Council . 
 = = Memorials = = 
 According to Edward Trollope , the oldest tombstone in the church was from the 13th century ; it was faded and illegible when he recorded it in or before 1872 . A 14th @-@ century slab , originally for a now @-@ lost effigy , is in the church , and brass plate from the same period was discovered during the 1853 restoration . Richard <unk> , along with his wife Joanna and son John , are commemorated in a plaque dating to the 1430s , and a plaque to William <unk> and his wife Elizabeth also dates to the 15th century . 
 Although Gervase Holles recorded many 16th @-@ century monuments when he visited Sleaford , most have disappeared . Amongst those which remain are the tombs and plaques commemorating the first members of the Carre family to settle in Sleaford . The <unk> hailed from Northumberland , but George Carre ( d . 1521 ) , a wool merchant , established himself in the town and is commemorated in St Denys ' by a brass . On the northern side of the chancel is an alabaster monument dedicated to George 's eldest surviving son Robert Carre ( d . 1590 ) , his three wives and some of their children ; he became lord of the manors of Old and New Sleaford . Opposite , on the southern side , is an alabaster altar tomb by Maximilian Colt dedicated to Robert 's fourth son and eventual heir , Sir Edward Carre , 1st Baronet ( d . 1618 ) , which carries the effigies of Edward and one of his two wives , probably his second , Anne Dyer ; according to Trollope , it was " said to have been mutilated during the Civil War " . Further plaques commemorate Sir Edward Carre 's grandson , Sir Robert Carre , 3rd Baronet ( d . 1682 ) , and his son , Sir Edward ( d . 1683 ) , who is also commemorated by a bust in the church . 
 There are numerous other memorials to prominent <unk> . Early examples are plaques to John <unk> ( d . 1591 , monument dated 1631 ) , the draper Richard <unk> ( d . 1609 , erected by Robert <unk> ) , and Rev. Theophilus <unk> ( d . 1696 ) . Later monuments include those of Richard Moore ( d . 1771 ) and Elizabeth Cooper ( d . 1792 ) , as well as a slab for Eleanor ( d . 1725 ) , wife of John Peart . The novelist Frances Brooke ( d . 1789 ) is buried in the church . Clergymen include William Seller , Joseph Francis ( d . 1749 ) and Anthony <unk> ( d . 1773 ) . A window is dedicated to a local solicitor , Henry Snow ( d . 1905 ) , and memorials on the north wall include George Jeudwine ( d . 1952 ) , another solicitor , and the local historian William <unk> ( d . 1987 ) . The monument to Ann Bankes ( d . 1834 ) incorporates a statue of a woman sinking into the ground , which Pevsner called " remarkably tender " , while the tablet to Ann Moore ( d . 1830 ) in the transept is noted as " good Grecian " . 
 = Inspirations for James Bond = 
 A number of real @-@ life inspirations have been suggested for James Bond , the fictional character created in 1953 by British author , journalist and Naval Intelligence Officer Ian Fleming ; Bond appeared in twelve novels and nine short stories by Fleming , as well as a number of continuation novels and twenty @-@ six films , with seven actors playing the role of Bond . 
 Although the stories and characters were fictional , a number of elements had a real life background , taken from people whom Fleming knew or events he was aware of . These included the spy 's name , which Fleming took from the American ornithologist James Bond , and the code number — 007 — which referred to the breaking of a World War I German diplomatic code . Some aspects of Bond 's character and tastes replicate those of Fleming himself . 
 = = Origins of the name = = 
 On the morning of 17 February 1952 Ian Fleming started writing what would become his first book , Casino Royale , at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica . He typed out 2 @,@ 000 words in the morning , directly from his own experiences and imagination and finished work on the manuscript in just over a month , completing it on 18 March 1952 . Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist James Bond , a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies ; Fleming , a keen birdwatcher himself , had a copy of Bond 's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist 's wife that " It struck me that this brief , unromantic , Anglo @-@ Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed , and so a second James Bond was born " . 
 On another occasion Fleming said : " I wanted the simplest , dullest , plainest @-@ sounding name I could find , ' James Bond ' was much better than something more interesting , like ' Peregrine Carruthers ' . Exotic things would happen to and around him , but he would be a neutral figure — an anonymous , blunt instrument wielded by a government department . " After Fleming met the ornithologist and his wife , he described them as " a charming couple who are amused by the whole joke " . The ornithologist was obliquely referred to in the film Die Another Day with Pierce Brosnan 's Bond picking up a copy of Birds of the West Indies and posing as an ornithologist . 
 = = Character inspirations = = 
 During the Second World War Fleming was the personal assistant to the Director of the Naval Intelligence Division , Admiral John Godfrey . He reached the rank of commander — a rank he subsequently gave to his fictional creation — and was the planner for special operations unit 30th Assault Unit . Many of Bond 's tastes and traits were Fleming 's own , including sharing the same golf handicap , the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries . Bond 's tastes are also often taken from Fleming 's , as was his behaviour , with Bond 's love of golf and gambling mirroring his creator 's . Fleming used the experiences of his espionage career and other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing , including using names of school friends , acquaintances , relatives and lovers throughout his books .
