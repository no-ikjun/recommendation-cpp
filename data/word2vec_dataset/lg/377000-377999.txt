 = = = British situation = = = 
 In June 1777 British General John Burgoyne , known as " Gentleman Johnny " for his manners , moved south from the province of Quebec to gain control of the upper Hudson River valley . After his early capture of Fort Ticonderoga , his campaign had become bogged down in difficulties . Elements of the army had reached the upper Hudson as early as the end of July , but logistical and supply difficulties delayed the main army at Fort Edward . One attempt to alleviate these difficulties failed when nearly 1 @,@ 000 men were killed or captured at the August 16 Battle of Bennington . Furthermore , news reached Burgoyne on August 28 that St. Leger 's expedition down the Mohawk River valley had turned back after the failed Siege of Fort Stanwix . 
 Combined with earlier news that General William Howe had sailed his army from New York City on a campaign to capture Philadelphia instead of moving north to meet Burgoyne , and the departure of most of his Native American support following the loss at Bennington , Burgoyne 's situation was becoming difficult . Faced with the need to reach defensible winter quarters , which would require either retreat back to Ticonderoga or advance to Albany , he decided on the latter . Consequent to this decision he made two further crucial decisions . He decided to deliberately cut communications to the north , so that he would not need to maintain a chain of heavily fortified outposts between his position and Ticonderoga , and he decided to cross the Hudson River while he was in a relatively strong position . He therefore ordered Baron Riedesel , who commanded the rear of the army , to abandon outposts from Skenesboro south , and then had the army cross the Hudson just north of Saratoga between September 13 and 15 .

 The Continental Army had been in a slow steady state of retreat ever since Burgoyne 's capture of Ticonderoga early in July . By mid @-@ August the army , then under the command of Major General Philip Schuyler , was encamped south of Stillwater , New York . On August 19 , Major General Horatio Gates assumed command from Schuyler , whose political fortunes had fallen over the loss of Ticonderoga and the ensuing retreat . Gates and Schuyler , who were from very different backgrounds , did not get along with each other , and had previously argued over command issues in the army 's Northern Department . Gates became the beneficiary of an army that was growing in size as a result of increased militia turnout following calls by state governors , the success at Bennington , and widespread outrage over the slaying of Jane McCrea , the fiancée of a Loyalist in Burgoyne 's army , by Native Americans in Burgoyne 's command . 
 Strategic decisions by the American commander in chief , General George Washington also improved the situation for Gates 's army . Washington was most concerned about the movements of General Howe , and what his goal was . Aware that Burgoyne was also moving , he took some risks in July and sent aid north in the form of Major General Benedict Arnold , his most aggressive field commander , and Major General Benjamin Lincoln , a Massachusetts man noted for his influence with the New England militia . In August , before he was certain that Howe had indeed sailed south , he ordered 750 men from Israel Putnam 's forces defending the New York highlands to join Gates ' army , and also sent some of the best forces from his own army : Colonel Daniel Morgan and the newly formed Provisional Rifle Corps , which comprised about 500 specially selected riflemen from Pennsylvania , Maryland , and Virginia , chosen for their sharpshooting ability . This unit came to be known as Morgan 's Riflemen . 
 On September 7 , Gates ordered his army to march north . A site known as Bemis Heights , just north of Stillwater and about 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of Saratoga , was selected for its defensive potential , and the army spent about a week constructing defensive works designed by Polish engineer Tadeusz Kościuszko . The heights had a commanding view of the area and commanded the only road to Albany , where it passed through a defile between the heights and the Hudson . To the west of the heights lay more heavily forested bluffs that would present a significant challenge to any heavily equipped army .

 = = = Prelude = = = 
 Moving cautiously , since the departure of his Native American support had deprived him of reliable reports on the American position , Burgoyne advanced to the south after crossing the Hudson . On September 18 the vanguard of his army had reached a position just north of Saratoga , about 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) from the American defensive line , and skirmishes occurred between American scouting parties and the leading elements of his army . 
 The American camp had become a bed of festering intrigue ever since Arnold 's return from Fort Stanwix . While he and Gates had previously been on reasonably good terms in spite of their prickly egos , Arnold managed to turn Gates against him by taking on as staff officers friendly to Schuyler , dragging him into the ongoing feud between the two . These conditions had not yet reached a boil on September 19 , but the day 's events contributed to the situation . Gates had assigned the left wing of the defenses to Arnold , and assumed command himself of the right , which was nominally assigned to General Lincoln , whom Gates had detached in August with some troops to harass the British positions behind Burgoyne 's army . 
 Both Burgoyne and Arnold understood the importance of the American left , and the need to control the heights there . After the morning fog lifted around 10 am , Burgoyne ordered the army to advance in three columns . Baron Riedesel led the left column , consisting of the German troops and the 47th Foot , on the river road , bringing the main artillery and guarding supplies and the boats on the river . General James Inglis Hamilton commanded the center column , consisting of the 9th , 20th , 21st , and 62nd regiments , which would attack the heights , and General Simon Fraser led the right wing with the 24th Regiment and the light infantry and grenadier companies , to turn the American left flank by negotiating the heavily wooded high ground north and west of Bemis Heights . 
 Arnold also realized such a flanking maneuver was likely , and petitioned Gates for permission to move his forces from the heights to meet potential movements , where the American skill at woodlands combat would be at an advantage . Gates , whose preferred strategy was to sit and wait for the expected frontal assault , grudgingly permitted a reconnaissance in force consisting of Daniel Morgan 's men and Henry Dearborn 's light infantry . When Morgan 's men reached an open field northwest of Bemis Heights belonging to Loyalist John Freeman , they spotted British advance troops in the field . Fraser 's column was slightly delayed and had not yet reached the field , while Hamilton 's column had also made its way across a ravine and was approaching the field from the east through dense forest and difficult terrain . Riedesel 's force , while it was on the road , was delayed by obstacles thrown down by the Americans . The sound of gunfire to the west prompted Riedesel to send some of his artillery down a track in that direction . The troops Morgan 's men saw were an advance company from Hamilton 's column . 
 = = = Battle = = = 
 Morgan placed marksmen at strategic positions , who then picked off virtually every officer in the advance company . Morgan and his men then charged , unaware that they were headed directly for Burgoyne 's main army . While they succeeded in driving back the advance company , Fraser 's leading edge arrived just in time to attack Morgan 's left , scattering his men back into the woods . James Wilkinson , who had ridden forward to observe the fire , returned to the American camp for reinforcements . As the British company fell back toward the main column , the leading edge of that column opened fire , killing a number of their own men . 
 There was then a lull in the fighting around 1 : 00 pm as Hamilton 's men began to form up on the north side of the field , and American reinforcements began to arrive from the south . Learning that Morgan was in trouble , Gates ordered out two more regiments ( 1st and 3rd New Hampshire ) to support him , with additional regiments ( 2nd New York , 4th New York , the 1st Canadian , and Connecticut militia ) from the brigade of Enoch Poor to follow . Burgoyne arrayed Hamilton 's men with the 21st on the right , the 20th on the left , and the 62nd in the center , with the 9th held in reserve . 
 The battle then went through phases alternating between intense fighting and breaks in the action . Morgan 's men had regrouped in the woods , and picked off officers and artillerymen . They were so effective at reducing the latter that the Americans several times gained brief control of British field pieces , only to lose them in the next British charge . At one point it was believed that Burgoyne himself had been taken down by a sharpshooter ; it was instead one of Burgoyne 's aides , riding a richly dressed horse , who was the victim . The center of the British line was very nearly broken at one point , and only the intervention of General Phillips , leading the 20th , made it possible for the 62nd to reform . 
 The final stroke of the battle belonged to the British . Around 3 pm , Riedesel sent a messenger to Burgoyne for instructions . He returned two hours later with orders to guard the baggage train , but also to send as many men as he could spare toward the American right flank . In a calculated risk , Riedesel left 500 men to guard the vital supply train and marched off toward the action with the rest of his column . Two of his companies advanced on the double and opened vicious fire on the American right , and Fraser 's force threatened to turn the American left flank . In response to the latter threat , Arnold requested more forces , and Gates allowed him to dispatch Ebenezer Learned 's brigade ( 2nd , 8th and 9th Massachusetts ) . ( If Arnold had been on the field , these forces might have instead faced the larger danger posed by Riedesel 's force . ) Fortunately for the American right , darkness set in , bringing an end to the battle . The Americans retreated back to their defenses , leaving the British on the field . 
 Burgoyne had gained the field of battle , but suffered nearly 600 casualties . Most of these were to Hamilton 's center column , where the 62nd was reduced to the size of a single company , and three quarters of the artillery men were killed or wounded . American losses were nearly 300 killed and seriously wounded . 
 It has been widely recounted in histories of this battle that General Arnold was on the field , directing some of the action . However , John <unk> , a former park historian at the Saratoga National Historical Park , carefully documents the evolution of this story and believes it is without foundation in contemporary materials , and that Arnold remained at Gates ' headquarters , receiving news and dispatching orders through messengers . Arnold biographer James Kirby Martin , however , disagrees with <unk> , arguing that Arnold played a more active role at Freeman 's Farm by directing patriot troops into position and possibly leading some charges before being ordered back to headquarters by Gates . 
 = = Interlude = = 
 Burgoyne 's council discussed whether to attack the next day , and a decision was reached to delay further action at least one day , to September 21 . The army moved to consolidate the position closer to the American line while some men collected their dead . The attack on the 21st was called off when Burgoyne received a letter dated September 12 from Henry Clinton , who was commanding the British garrison in New York City . Clinton suggested that he could " make a push at [ Fort ] Montgomery in about ten days . " ( Fort Montgomery was an American post on the Hudson River , in the New York Highlands south of West Point ) . If Clinton left New York on September 22 , " about ten days " after he wrote the letter , he still could not hope to arrive in the vicinity of Saratoga before the end of the month . Burgoyne , running low on men and food , was still in a very difficult position , but he decided to wait in the hope that Clinton would arrive to save his army . Burgoyne wrote to Clinton on September 23 , requesting some sort of assistance or diversion to draw Gates ' army away . Clinton sailed from New York on October 3 , and captured Forts Montgomery and Clinton on October 6 . The furthest north any of his troops reached was Clermont , where they raided the estate of the prominent Patriot Livingston family on October 16 . 
 Unknown to either side at Saratoga , General Lincoln and Colonel John Brown had staged an attack against the British position at Fort Ticonderoga . Lincoln had collected 2 @,@ 000 men at Bennington by early September . Brown and a detachment of 500 men captured poorly defended positions between Ticonderoga and Lake George , and then spent several days ineffectually bombarding the fort . These men , and some of the prisoners they freed along the way , were back in the American camp by September 29 . 
 In the American camp the mutual resentment between Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold finally exploded into open hostility . Gates quickly reported the action of September 19 to the Congress and Governor George Clinton of New York , but he failed to mention Arnold at all . The field commanders and men universally credited Arnold for their success . Almost all the troops involved were from Arnold 's command and Arnold was the one directing the battle while Gates sat in his tent . Arnold protested , and the dispute escalated into a shouting match that ended with Gates relieving Arnold of his command and giving it to Benjamin Lincoln . Arnold asked for a transfer to Washington 's command , which Gates granted , but instead of leaving he remained in his tent . There is no documentary evidence for a commonly recounted anecdote that a petition signed by line officers convinced Arnold to stay in camp . 
 During this period there were almost daily clashes between pickets and patrols of the two armies . Morgan 's sharpshooters , familiar with the strategy and tactics of woodland warfare , constantly harassed British patrols on the western flank . 
 As September passed into October it became clear that Clinton was not coming to help Burgoyne , who put the army on short rations on October 3 . The next day , Burgoyne called a war council in which several options were discussed , but no conclusive decisions were made . When the council resumed the next day , Riedesel proposed retreat , in which he was supported by Fraser . Burgoyne refused to consider it , insisting that retreat would be disgraceful . They finally agreed to conduct an assault on the American left flank with two thousand men , more than one third of the army , on October 7 . The army he was attacking , however , had grown in the interval . In addition to the return of Lincoln 's detachment , militiamen and supplies continued to pour into the American camp , including critical increases in ammunition , which had been severely depleted in the first battle . The army Burgoyne faced on October 7 was more than 12 @,@ 000 men strong and was led by a man who knew how much trouble Burgoyne was in . Gates had received consistent intelligence from the stream of deserters leaving the British lines , and had also intercepted Clinton 's response to Burgoyne 's plea for help .

 = = = British foray = = = 
 While Burgoyne 's troop strength was nominally higher , he likely had only about 5 @,@ 000 effective , battle @-@ ready troops on October 7 , as losses from the earlier battles in the campaign and desertions following the September 19 battle had reduced his forces . General Riedesel advised that the army retreat . Burgoyne decided to reconnoiter the American left flank to see if an attack was possible . As escort the generals took Fraser 's Advanced Corps , with light troops and the 24th Foot on the right and the combined British grenadiers on the left , and a force drawn from all the German regiments in the army in the center . There were 8 British cannon under Major Williams and 2 Hesse @-@ Hanau cannon under Captain Pausch . Leaving their camp between 10 and 11 am , they advanced about three quarters of a mile ( 1 km ) to Barber 's wheat field on a rise above Mill Brook , where they stopped to observe the American position . While the field afforded some room for artillery to work , the flanks were dangerously close to the surrounding woods . 
 Gates , following the removal of Arnold from the field command , assumed command of the American left and gave the right to General Lincoln . When American scouts brought news of Burgoyne 's movement to Gates , he ordered Morgan 's riflemen out to the far left , with Poor 's men ( 1st , 2nd , and 3rd New Hampshire on the left ; the 2nd and 4th New York Regiments ) on the right , and Learned 's ( 1st New York , 1st Canadian , 2nd , 8th and 9th Massachusetts Regiments , plus militia companies ) in the center . A force of 1 @,@ 200 New York militia under Brigadier General Abraham Ten Broeck was held in reserve behind Learned 's line . In all , more than 8 @,@ 000 Americans took the field that day , including about 1 @,@ 400 men from Lincoln 's command that were deployed when the action became particularly fierce . 
 The opening fire came between 2 and 2 : 30 pm from the British grenadiers . Poor 's men held their fire , and the terrain made the British shooting largely ineffective . When Major Acland led the British grenadiers in a bayonet charge , the Americans finally began shooting at close range . Acland fell , shot in both legs , and many of the grenadiers also went down . Their column was in a total rout , and Poor 's men advanced to take Acland and Williams prisoner and capture their artillery . On the American left , things were also not going well for the British . Morgan 's men swept aside the Canadians and Native Americans to engage Fraser 's regulars . Although slightly outnumbered , Morgan managed to break up several British attempts to move west . While General Fraser was mortally wounded in this phase of the battle , a frequently told story claiming it to be the work of Timothy Murphy , one of Morgan 's men , appears to be a 19th @-@ century fabrication . The felling of Fraser and the arrival of Ten Broeck 's large militia brigade ( which roughly equalled the entire British reconnaissance force in size ) , broke the British will , and they began a disorganized retreat toward their entrenchments . Burgoyne was also very nearly killed by one of Morgan 's marksmen ; three shots hit his horse , hat and waistcoat . 
 The first phase of the battle lasted about one hour , and cost Burgoyne nearly 400 men , including the capture of most of the grenadiers ' command , and six of the ten field pieces brought to the action . 
 = = = American attack = = = 
 At this point , the Americans were joined by an unexpected participant . General Arnold , who was " betraying great agitation and wrath " in the American camp , and may have been drinking , rode out to join the action . Gates immediately sent Major Armstrong after him with orders to return ; Armstrong did not catch up with Arnold until the action was effectively over . ( A letter , written by a witness to proceedings in the camp , suggests that Arnold did in fact have authorization from Gates to engage in this action . ) 
 The defenses on the right side of the British camp were anchored by two redoubts . The outermost one was defended by about 300 men under the command of the Hessian Heinrich von Breymann , while the other was under the command of Lord Balcarres . A small contingent of Canadians occupied the ground between these two fortifications . Most of the retreating force headed for Balcarres ' position , as Breymann 's was slightly north and further away from the early action . 
 Arnold led the American chase , and then led Poor 's men in an attack on the Balcarres redoubt . Balcarres had set up his defenses well , and the redoubt was held , in action so fierce that Burgoyne afterwards wrote , " A more determined perseverance than they showed … is not in any officer 's experience " . Seeing that the advance was checked , and that Learned was preparing to attack the Breymann redoubt , Arnold moved toward that action , recklessly riding between the lines and remarkably emerging unhurt . He led the charge of Learned 's men through the gap between the redoubts , which exposed the rear of Breymann 's position , where Morgan 's men had circled around from the far side . In furious battle , the redoubt was taken and Breymann was killed . Arnold 's horse was hit in one of the final volleys , and Arnold 's leg was broken by both shot and the falling horse . Major Armstrong finally caught up with Arnold to officially order him back to headquarters ; he was carried back in a litter . 
 The capture of Breymann 's redoubt exposed the British camp , but darkness was setting in . An attempt by some Germans to retake the redoubt ended in capture as darkness fell and an unreliable guide led them to the American line . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Burgoyne 's failed campaign , as may be seen by the titles of some of the books that cover it in detail , marked a major turning point in the war . After the battle , he withdrew his men 10 – 15 miles north , near present @-@ day Schuylerville , New York . General Burgoyne returned to England and was never given another commanding position in the British Army . 
 = = = Armies and casualties = = = 
 Burgoyne lost 1 @,@ 000 men in the two battles , leaving him outnumbered by roughly 3 to 1 ; American losses came to about 500 killed and wounded . Burgoyne had lost several of his most effective leaders , his attempts to capture the American position had failed , and his forward line was now breached . That night he lit fires at his remaining forward positions and withdrew under the cover of darkness . On the morning of October 8 , he was back in the fortified positions he had held on September 16 . By October 13 he was surrounded at Saratoga , and on October 17 he surrendered his army . The remnants of his expedition retreated from Ticonderoga back to Quebec . 
 The British learned that the Americans would fight bravely and effectively . Said one British officer : 
 " The courage and obstinacy with which the Americans fought were the astonishment of everyone , and we now became fully convinced that they are not that contemptible enemy we had hitherto imagined them , incapable of standing a regular engagement , and that they would only fight behind strong and powerful works . " 
 In recognition of his contribution to the battles at Saratoga , General Arnold had his seniority restored ( he had lost it after being passed over for promotion earlier in 1777 ) . His leg wound left Arnold bedridden for five months . Later , while still unfit for field service but serving as military governor of Philadelphia , Arnold entered into treasonous correspondence with the British . He received command of the fort at West Point and plotted to hand it over to the British , only to flee into the British lines when the capture of his contact John Andre led to exposure of the plot . Arnold went on to serve under William Phillips , the commander of Burgoyne 's right wing , in a 1781 expedition into Virginia . 
 Although he left the direction of the battle to subordinates , General Gates received a great deal of credit as the commanding general for the greatest American victory of the war to date . He may have conspired with others to replace George Washington as the commander @-@ in @-@ chief . Instead he received the command of the main American army in the South . He led it to a disastrous defeat at the 1780 Battle of Camden , where he was at the forefront of a panicked retreat . Gates never commanded troops in the field again . 
 In response to Burgoyne 's surrender , Congress declared December 18 , 1777 , as a national day " for solemn Thanksgiving and praise " ; it was the nation 's first official observance of a holiday with that name . 
 = = = French aid = = = 
 Once news of Burgoyne 's surrender reached France , King Louis XVI decided to enter into negotiations with the Americans that resulted in a formal Franco @-@ American alliance and French entry into the war . This moved the conflict onto a global stage . As a consequence , Britain was forced to divert resources used to fight the war in North America to theaters in the West Indies and Europe , and rely on what turned out to be the chimera of Loyalist support in its North American operations . Being defeated by the British in the French and Indian War more than a decade earlier , France found an opportunity of revenge by aiding the colonists throughout the Revolutionary War . Prior to the Battle of Saratoga , France didn 't fully aid the colonists . However , after the Battles of Saratoga were conclusively won by the colonists , France realized that the Americans had hope of winning the war , and began fully aiding the colonists by sending soldiers , donations , loans , military arms , and supplies . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The battlefield and the site of Burgoyne 's surrender have been preserved , and are now administered by the National Park Service as the Saratoga National Historical Park , which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 . The park preserves a number of the buildings in the area , and contains a variety of monuments . The Saratoga Monument obelisk has four niches , three of which hold statues of American generals : Gates and Schuyler and of Colonel Daniel Morgan . The fourth niche , where Arnold 's statue would go , is empty . A more dramatic memorial to Arnold 's heroism , that does not name him , is the Boot Monument . Donated by Civil War General John Watts de Peyster , it shows a boot with spurs and the stars of a major general . It stands at the spot where Arnold was shot on October 7 charging Breymann 's redoubt , and is dedicated to " the most brilliant soldier of the Continental Army " . 
 Six Army National Guard units ( 101st Eng Bn , 102nd Inf , 125th QM Co , 181st Inf , 182nd Inf and 192nd MP Bn ) are derived from American units that participated in the Battle of Saratoga . There are now only thirty units in the U.S. Army with lineages that go back to the colonial era . 
 There are a number of ships named after the battles including USS Saratoga ( 1842 ) , USS Saratoga ( CV @-@ 3 ) , and USS Saratoga ( CV @-@ 60 )

 Hesketh @-@ Prichard was born an only child on 17 November 1876 in Jhansi , in the state of Uttar Pradesh , India . His father Hesketh Brodrick Prichard , an officer in the King 's Own Scottish Borderers , died from typhoid six weeks before he was born , leading him to be raised alone by his mother , Kate O 'Brien Ryall Prichard . She herself had come from a military family , her father being Major @-@ General Browne William Ryall . 
 Hesketh @-@ Prichard and his mother returned to Great Britain soon after , and lived for a while at her parents ' house , before moving to St Helier on Jersey for several years . His nickname was " Hex " , which he would bear throughout his life . They returned to the mainland that the boy might be educated at a prep school in Rugby . In 1887 he won a scholarship to Fettes College , Edinburgh ; his entrance paper was an essay on " Summer Sports " . He excelled at sports there , particularly cricket , at which the school magazine described him as " the best bowler we have had for a long time " . He was invited to play for Scotland against South Africa , but declined as he would have been unable to play against <unk> 's rival Loretto School . After school , he studied law privately in Horsham , West Sussex . He passed the preliminary exam , though he would never practice as a solicitor .

 He wrote his first story " <unk> 's Duel " in the summer of 1896 , which his mother helped him refine , and was sold soon after to Pall Mall Magazine for a guinea . That year he abandoned a career in law and spent the summer travelling around southern Europe and North Africa . He spent the sea @-@ time on the trip writing or planning plots . When back in London , he and his mother wrote together under the pseudonyms " H. Heron " and " E. Heron " , and saw publication in several journals , including Cornhill Magazine . Hesketh @-@ Prichard 's circle of literary friends widened and he became acquainted with the likes of Arthur Conan Doyle and J. M. Barrie . In 1897 Barrie introduced him to the press baron Cyril Arthur Pearson , who suggested he write a series of ghost stories for his monthly Pearson 's Magazine . Hesketh @-@ Prichard and his mother created a series of stories around the character " Flaxman Low " ' , the first psychic detective of fiction , though they were disconcerted to find the tales promoted by Pearson as " real " . The collected work was published as The Experiences of Flaxman Low in 1899 . 
 In 1897 , he and his mother worked on the plot of A Modern Mercenary , the stories of Captain <unk> , a dashing diplomat in Germany . It was published by Smith and Elder the following year . He travelled to South America in February 1898 , seeing the construction work for the Panama Canal , but returned after developing malaria while in the Caribbean .

 In 1899 Pearson chose Hesketh @-@ Prichard to explore and report on the relatively unknown republic of Haiti , wanting something dramatic with which to launch his forthcoming Daily Express . His mother accompanied him as far as Jamaica ; in later years she would often travel with him to remote destinations in a time when it was uncommon for a woman of her age to do so . Hesketh @-@ Prichard travelled extensively into the uncharted interior of Haiti , narrowly avoiding death on one occasion when someone tried to poison him . No white man was believed to have crossed the island since 1803 , and his trip provided the first written description of some of the secret practices of " <unk> " ( voodoo ) . He later wrote a vivid account of his travels in the popular book Where Black Rules White : A Journey Across and About <unk> . 
 Pearson welcomed his reports , and on his return immediately commissioned him to travel to Patagonia to investigate dramatic rumours of a hairy beast roaming the land . The animal was conjectured by Natural History Museum director Ray Lankester to be a living example of the long @-@ extinct giant ground sloth . Hesketh @-@ Prichard 's talent for descriptive narration enthralled the readers of the Daily Express . He explored the area surrounding Lake Argentino , finding one of its feeder lakes , naming it Lake Pearson after his patron , and their connecting river Caterina after his mother . Lake Pearson was subsequently renamed Lake Anita , but the Río Caterina , known for its salmon , retains the name Hesketh @-@ Prichard gave it . The surrounding area is now part of Los <unk> National Park . 
 Although he found no traces of the creature after a year overseas and 10 @,@ 000 miles ( 16 @,@ 000 km ) of travel , he did provide compelling descriptions of unknown areas of the country , its fauna and inhabitants .

 His most ambitious trip to the region was however in July 1910 , when he undertook to explore the interior of Labrador , saying " it seemed to us a pity that such a terra incognita should continue to exist under the British flag " . This same territory had claimed the life of writer Leonidas Hubbard a few years earlier . He described his journey up the Fraser River to access Indian House Lake on George River in the popular Through <unk> Labrador in 1911 . 
 His reputation was such that former president Theodore Roosevelt , a fellow writer , explorer and hunter , wrote to him , commending him on his latest book , which he described as the best that season , and asking to meet him .

His article " <unk> for Fashion " in the March 1914 Pearson 's Magazine argued to protect birds from slaughter for their feathers for hats , the so @-@ called plume hunting . 
 = = Cricket = = 
 Hesketh @-@ Prichard was a talented cricketer , and played for a number of teams , including Hampshire , London County , and Marylebone Cricket Club . A right @-@ arm fast bowler , he made his début in the first class game when he played for Hampshire against Somerset in the 1900 County Championship . He was not however a strong batsman , and would typically play in the tail of the batting order . He joined the short @-@ lived London County in 1902 , where he was a teammate of W. G. Grace . In 1903 he played his first of several games for The Gentlemen v The Players at Lords . He would be selected for The Gentleman three years in succession . In 1904 , he joined the MCC , and took part in Lord Brackley 's XI 's tour of the West Indies in the 1904 / 5 season . In 1907 , he toured the United States with the MCC . 
 A tall man , he was able to use his height and reach to his advantage when bowling . In a first @-@ class career that lasted from 1900 to 1913 , he took 339 wickets for a total of 7 @,@ 586 runs . A career best was 8 / 32 for Hampshire against Derbyshire in July 1905 . 
 = = Military service = = 
 At the outbreak of the First World War , Hesketh @-@ Prichard tried for a commission in the Black Watch and Guards , but both turned him down because of his age , then 37 . He was eventually successful obtaining a post as Assistant Press Officer at the War Office , and first sent to the front lines in France in February 1915 as an " eyewitness officer " in charge of war correspondents . By this time , open warfare on the front had ceased , and had stagnated into the trench warfare that characterised much of the conflict . He witnessed there the victims of gas attack . 
 Hesketh @-@ Prichard was shocked to learn of the high attrition rate due to well @-@ trained German snipers . It was common for British regiments to lose five men a day to snipers ; he learned that one battalion lost eighteen in a single day . The German snipers could not be located , leaving them free to continue shooting from their place of concealment . He was also dismayed by the poor quality of marksmanship amongst the British troops . 
 He set about improving the quality of marksmanship , calibrating and correcting the few telescopic sights that the army already possessed . He borrowed more sights and hunting rifles from friends and famous hunters back home , and funded the acquisition of others from his own pocket , or donations he solicited . To investigate the quality of German armour plate , he retrieved a sample from a German trench . He discovered that their armour could only be penetrated by a heavy cartridge such as Jeffery 333 , while British plate could be easily defeated by a much smaller gun such as a Mauser . 
 = = = Innovations = = = 
 He recognised German skill in constructing trench parapets : by making use of an irregular top and face to the parapet , and constructing it from material of varying composition , the presence of a sniper or an observer poking his head up became much less conspicuous . In contrast , British trench practice had been to give a military @-@ straight neat edge to the parapet top , making any movement or protrusion immediately obvious . 
 An observer was vulnerable to an enemy sniper firing a bullet through his loophole , but Hesketh @-@ Prichard devised a metal @-@ armoured double loophole that would protect him . The front loophole was fixed , but the rear was housed in a metal shutter sliding in grooves . Only when the two loopholes were lined up — a one @-@ to @-@ twenty chance — could an enemy shoot between them . 
 Another innovation was the use of a dummy head to find the location of an enemy sniper . The tempting target of a realistic papier @-@ mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board . To increase the realism , a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy 's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube . If the head was shot , it was dropped rapidly , simulating a casualty . The sniper 's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy 's head . The head was then raised in the groove again , but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope . If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole , its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been . By looking through the rear hole in the head , through the front hole and up through the periscope , the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken , and so would be looking directly at the sniper , revealing his position . 
 = = = Training snipers = = = 
 Hesketh @-@ Prichard was eventually successful in gaining official support for his campaign , and in August 1915 was given permission to proceed with formalised sniper training . By November of that year , his reputation was such that he was in high demand from many units . In December he was ordered on General Allenby 's request to the Third Army School of Instruction and was made a general staff officer with the rank of captain . He was Mentioned in Despatches on 1 January 1916 . 
 In August 1916 , he founded the First Army School of Sniping in the village of <unk> , Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais . Starting with a first class of only six , in time he was able to lecture to large numbers of soldiers from different Allied nations , proudly proclaiming in a letter that his school was turning out snipers at three times the rate of any such other school in the world . In October of that year he was awarded the Military Cross , the citation of which read : " For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty . He has instructed snipers in the trenches on many occasions , and in most dangerous Circumstances , with great skill and determination . He has , directly and indirectly , inflicted enormous casualties on the enemy . " His friend George Gray , himself a champion shooter , told him that he had reduced sniping casualties from five a week per battalion to forty @-@ four in three months in sixty battalions ; by his reckoning , this meant that Hesketh @-@ Prichard had saved over 3 @,@ 500 lives . He was promoted to major in November 1916 . By this time in the war , his contributions to sniping had been such that the former German superiority in the practice had now been reversed .

 Hesketh @-@ Prichard was taken ill with an undetermined infection in late 1917 and was granted leave . His health remained poor for the rest of his life , and he spent much of it convalescing . It was during this period of leave that he learned that he had been awarded the Distinguished Service Order , for his work with the First Army School of Sniping , Observation , and Scouting . For his wartime work with the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps , he was appointed a Commander of the Military Order of Avis . 
 He continued to write and hunt when his health permitted him . In 1920 , he wrote his account of his war time activities in the critically acclaimed Sniping in France ( full @-@ text available on Wikisource and as a PDF document ) , which is still referenced by modern authors on the subject . The following year he wrote Sport in Wildest Britain , in which he shared his experiences of bird shooting , particularly in the Outer Hebrides .

 In 1908 , Hesketh Hesketh @-@ Prichard married Lady Elizabeth Grimston , the daughter of James Grimston , 3rd Earl of Verulam , whom he had met through friends . They had three children : Michael ( 19 February 1909 – September 1988 ) , Diana ( 26 March 1912 – 1970 ) , and Alfred Cecil Giles ( 1916 – 1944 ) , known as " Alfgar " . Alfgar was recruited to the Special Operations Executive during the Second World War , where he became the first head of its Czech Section , training agents to conduct the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich . Alfgar Hesketh @-@ Prichard died on service in Austria on 3 December 1944 , for which he was posthumously awarded the MC .

 In July 1919 , Hesketh @-@ Prichard was elected Chairman of the Society of Authors , of which he had been a member for many years . Poor health forced him to resign in the following January . 
 Hesketh @-@ Prichard died from sepsis on 14 June 1922 , at the ancestral home of his wife at <unk> , Hertfordshire , England . His obituarists ascribed this to an obscure form of blood poisoning brought on by gassing in the trenches during his war service . However , his ailments , including fatigue , heart – digestive – neurological disorders , appendicitis , cognitive problems , depression , anxiety — are today recognised as differential symptoms of malaria . Left untreated they sometimes lead to organ failure and death . 
 His body was cremated and the ashes interred in the family vault at St Michael 's Church , St Albans . His mother survived him for some years , dying in 1935 . 
 His wife Elizabeth , later becoming Woman of the Bedchamber to Queen Mary , lived until 1975 . 
 Hesketh @-@ Prichard 's biography was written two years after his death by his friend Eric Parker , who encapsulated his many accomplishments within its title : Hesketh Prichard D.S.O. , M.C. : Explorer , Naturalist , Cricketer , Author , Soldier . 
 = Kepler @-@ 4b = 
 Kepler @-@ 4b , initially known as KOI 7 @.@ 01 , is an extrasolar planet first detected as a transit by the Kepler spacecraft . Its radius and mass are similar to that of Neptune ; however , due to its proximity to its host star , it is substantially hotter than any planet in the Solar System . The planet 's discovery was announced on January 4 , 2010 in Washington , D.C. along with four other planets that were initially detected by the Kepler spacecraft and subsequently confirmed by telescopes at the W.M. Keck Observatory . 
 = = Nomenclature and history = = 
 Kepler @-@ 4b was named because it was the first planet discovered in the orbit of its star , Kepler @-@ 4 . The star was , in turn , named for the Kepler Mission , a NASA satellite whose purpose is to discover Earth @-@ like planets in a section of the sky between constellations Cygnus and Lyra using the transit method . Using this method , Kepler notes small and steady decreases in a star 's brightness that are measured as a planet crosses in front of it . Initially , Kepler @-@ 4b was detected as a transit event by the Kepler telescope and considered a Kepler Object of Interest with the designation KOI 7 @.@ 01 . 
 Subsequent radial velocity measurements by the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer on the telescopes of W.M. Keck Observatory confirmed the planetary nature of the transit event and established a mass estimate for the planet . The planet 's existence was announced on January 4 , 2010 along with four other planets detected by Kepler : Kepler @-@ 5b , 6b , 7b and 8b at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington , D.C.

 Kepler @-@ 4 is located within the Draco constellation on the sky , and is approximately 550 parsecs from the Solar System . It has an effective temperature almost identical to the Sun at <unk> Kelvin , but a mass and radius that are somewhat larger than the sun : respectively , 1 @.@ 092 <formula> and 1 @.@ 533 <formula> . The star is thought to be around 4 @.@ 5 billion years old , and at or very near the end of its main @-@ sequence hydrogen burning phase . In several tens of millions of years it will likely become a subgiant star . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Kepler @-@ 4b orbits its host star in 3 @.@ 213 days at a distance of 0 @.@ 046 AU . This places it almost 10 times closer to its star than Mercury is to the Sun . Consequently , Kepler @-@ 4b is thought to be extremely hot , with an equilibrium temperature greater than 1700 Kelvin ( 2600 Fahrenheit ) . The planet is estimated to be 25 times more massive than the Earth with a radius that is 4 times greater than the Earth . This makes it similar to Neptune in terms of size and mass , but with a temperature that is not comparable to any planet in the Solar System ( Venus , the hottest planet , is only 735 Kelvin ) . Kepler @-@ 4b 's eccentricity was assumed to be 0 , however an independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0 @.@ 25 ± 0 @.@ 12 . 
 = M @-@ 45 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 45 is a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan that is also called Lake Michigan Drive . The highway runs from Agnew near Lake Michigan to the west side of Grand Rapids in the western Lower Peninsula . Lake Michigan Drive continues in each direction from M @-@ 45 's termini , extending west of US Highway 31 ( US 31 ) and east of Interstate 196 ( I @-@ 196 ) . In between , the road runs through rural and suburban areas of Ottawa and Kent counties , including the main campus of Grand Valley State University in Allendale . Lake Michigan Drive was originally part of M @-@ 50 until the mid @-@ 1960s . Previously in the 1920s and 1930s , the M @-@ 45 number was designated along a highway in the Upper Peninsula ( UP ) . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Lake Michigan Drive starts near Lake Michigan at an intersection with Lakeshore Drive near the Grand Rapids water filtration plant . The road runs east to an intersection with US 31 in Agnew , where the M @-@ 45 designation begins . The area is marked by a mix of woodland and agricultural properties . The road runs through rural Ottawa County to Allendale . Through town , Lake Michigan Drive widens to a four @-@ lane divided boulevard with a median . East of the main part of town , M @-@ 45 passes the main campus of Grand Valley State University before crossing the Grand River . At 24th Avenue , the highway loses its median and gains a central turn lane . The landscape becomes more suburban as the highway crosses into Kent County near the M @-@ 11 intersection in Walker . From here east to the terminus in Grand Rapids , the road is lined with residential subdivisions and commercial properties . At Bridge Street , Lake Michigan Drive turns to the southeast and approaches John Ball Zoological Garden . M @-@ 45 ends at the interchange with I @-@ 196 . Lake Michigan Drive continues east to its end where it becomes Pearl Street near the Grand River downtown . 
 The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) maintains M @-@ 45 like all other parts of the state trunkline highway system . As part of these responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of the traffic using its roadways which is expressed using a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) . This is a calculation of the traffic levels for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year . In 2009 , 4 @,@ 910 vehicles used the section of M @-@ 45 near the western terminus daily . Near the interchange with I @-@ 196 , 32 @,@ 376 vehicles were observed along Lake Michigan Drive each day . No segment of the highway is listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 M @-@ 45 was originally designated in the UP on what is now M @-@ 95 by July 1 , 1919 . The highway ran between M @-@ 12 in Sagola and M @-@ 15 in Humboldt Township . When the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 , US 2 replaced most of M @-@ 12 through the UP . M @-@ 45 was extended south of Sagola to the north side of Iron Mountain . Along with this change , M @-@ 69 replaced another previous section of M @-@ 12 and all of M @-@ 90 . M @-@ 69 ran concurrently with M @-@ 45 between Sagola and Randville to connect these two highway segments . By 1933 , M @-@ 45 was extended concurrently along US 2 / US 141 into Iron Mountain and then as an independent routing through Kingsford to the Wisconsin state line . Before the next year , the M @-@ 95 replaced M @-@ 45 in the UP .

 The current designation of M @-@ 45 dates back to 1964 . M @-@ 50 was truncated to end near Lowell at I @-@ 96 . The remainder of M @-@ 50 on Cascade Road , Fulton Street and Lake Michigan Drive was redesignated as M @-@ 45 . The eastern section from Business US 131 ( Division Avenue ) to I @-@ 96 was turned over to local control in 1972 , shortening the route . The east end would be shortened again by 1995 , removing the M @-@ 45 designation east of I @-@ 196 . Jurisdiction was only transferred to the City of Grand Rapids on the portion from Division Avenue west to the Grand River , leaving part of West Fulton Street under state maintenance as an unsigned trunkline . M @-@ 45 was upgraded to a four @-@ lane divided highway in 2001 – 02 between Walker and the Grand Valley State campus in Allendale . The new alignment bypassed a section of road between 24th and 40th avenues . That section was renamed River Hill Drive , but retained as an unsigned state trunkline ( Old M @-@ 45 ) .

 = Tatsu = 
 Tatsu is a steel flying roller coaster designed by Bolliger & Mabillard at the Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park located in Valencia , California . Announced on November 17 , 2005 , the roller coaster opened to the public on May 13 , 2006 as the park 's seventeenth roller coaster . Tatsu reaches a height of 170 feet ( 52 m ) and speeds up to 62 miles per hour ( 100 km / h ) . The ride 's name comes from Japanese mythology and means Flying Beast in Japanese . The roller coaster is also the world 's tallest and fastest flying coaster ; is the only flying roller coaster to feature a zero @-@ gravity roll ; and has the world 's highest pretzel loop . It was the world 's longest flying coaster until The Flying Dinosaur surpassed it . 
 In the roller coaster 's opening year , it was named the 40th best roller coaster in the world in Amusement Today 's Golden Ticket Awards ; in Mitch Hawker 's Best Steel Roller Coaster Poll , the roller coaster placed at the 34 position . 
 = = History = = 
 Rumors of a new roller coaster being built at Six Flags Magic Mountain first emerged in the summer of 2004 . Land clearing began in mid @-@ 2005 around the Samurai Summit area of the park with track for the new roller coaster soon later beginning arriving from Ohio . Construction permits filed by Six Flags Magic Mountain and a trademark for the name Tatsu ( filed on August 23 , 2005 ) were later found by the public . Tatsu was officially announced to the public on November 17 , 2005 . Both Revolution and Roaring Rapids were temporarily closed in order for the roller coaster to be built . After construction and testing was complete , Tatsu opened to the public on May 13 , 2006 . 
 Tatsu broke several records upon its opening . The roller coaster is the world 's tallest , fastest , and longest flying roller coaster . The roller coaster also holds the record for the highest pretzel loop which is 124 feet ( 38 m ) high and is currently the only Flying roller coaster to have a zero @-@ gravity roll . 
 = = Ride experience = = 
 After the train has been moved into the horizontal position and is dispatched from the station , depending on which station the train is in ( Tatsu has two stations ) , the train will either make a left or right s @-@ bend towards the 170 @-@ foot ( 52 m ) lift hill . Once at the top , the train makes a sharp 111 @-@ foot ( 34 m ) downward right turn reaching a maximum speed of 62 miles per hour ( 100 km / h ) . After the train makes it to the bottom of the drop , the train makes an upward right turn leading into the first inversion , a 103 @-@ foot ( 31 m ) tall corkscrew . Next , the train makes a downward left turn immediately followed by an upward left turn into a 96 @-@ foot ( 29 m ) zero @-@ gravity roll . After the train exits the roll , it drops back down before going through a 84 @-@ foot ( 26 m ) horseshoe . Following a left turn , the train then enters the record @-@ breaking 124 @-@ foot ( 38 m ) pretzel loop . Upon exiting the pretzel loop , the train makes a slight left turn before going through an inline twist . The train then makes a 135 degree downward right turn before rising back up slightly and going through the mid @-@ course brake run . After exiting the brake run , the train makes a slight downward and upward left turn leading into the final brake run . The train then enters one of the two stations where the trains are put back into the vertical position for the riders to load and unload . One cycle of the ride lasts about two minutes . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Trains = = = 
 Tatsu operates with three steel and fiberglass trains . Each train has eight cars that can seat four riders in a single row for a total of 32 riders per train . Each seat has its own over @-@ the @-@ shoulder @-@ restraint and a pair of ankle restraints to hold the riders ' feet in place . The trains are painted green , yellow , orange , and red . 
 In the station , the trains are oriented in a vertical position in order to allow riders to board . Once the restraints are locked , the train seats are rotated forward 90 degrees into a horizontal position and the train is then dispatched from the station . When the train returns to the station , the seats rotate back down and the riders disembark for the next guests .

 The steel track of Tatsu is approximately 3 @,@ 602 feet ( 1 @,@ 098 m ) long and the height of the lift is approximately 170 feet ( 52 m ) . To slow the train down , air brakes are attached to the track throughout the two brake runs . The track was fabricated by Clermont Steel Fabricators in Batavia , Ohio , which manufactures Bolliger & Mabillard 's roller coasters . The track is colored red and yellow while the supports are orange .

 Joel Bullock from The Coaster Critic gave Tatsu a nine out of ten for its close @-@ to @-@ the @-@ ground approaches and intense pretzel loop at the bottom of the element . Justice from Park Thoughts also gave the roller coaster a nine out of ten saying that , " The lift hill is one of the most suspenseful I have ever experienced . " Justice also praises the ride 's intense g @-@ forces experienced throughout the layout of Tatsu . In 2006 , Discovery Channel 's Mega Builders aired an episode which followed the construction of Tatsu . The episode showed how the coaster was assembled and the problems construction crews had to overcome . 
 In Tatsu 's opening year , it was named the 40th best steel roller coaster in the world in Amusement Today 's Golden Ticket Awards ; tied with Talon at Dorney Park . It peaked at 28th place in 2012 . 
 In Mitch Hawker 's Best Steel Roller Coaster Poll , the roller coaster placed 34th in its opening year and peaked at 30th place in 2008 . 
 = 1946 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1946 Atlantic hurricane season resulted in no fatalities in the United States . The season officially began on June 16 , 1946 , and lasted until November 15 , 1946 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin . However , the first storm , developed in the Gulf of Mexico on June 13 , while the final system dissipated just offshore Florida on November 3 . There were seven tropical storm ; three of them attained hurricane status , while none intensified into major hurricanes , which are Category 3 or higher on the modern @-@ day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . This had not occurred since 1940 and would not again until 1968 . Operationally , the fifth tropical storm , which existed near the Azores in early October , was not considered a tropical cyclone , but was added to HURDAT in 2014 . 
 Although every tropical storm impacted land , effects overall were light , with less than $ 10 million ( 1946 USD ) in damage and no deaths in the United States throughout the season . The season 's most intense cyclone was the fourth hurricane . While the storm was moving northeastward offshore the East Coast of the United States , the Norwegian tanker Maril II was destroyed at sea , causing 16 drownings ; the incident could not be directly attributed to the hurricane . The second storm brought relatively minor damage to the Cape Fear region of North Carolina after striking the state early in its duration . While an extratropical cyclone , the remnants of the fifth cyclone devastated a few islands of the Azores and left 120 fishermen missing . The Florida hurricane severely damaged sugar cane in western Cuba and caused five deaths in the island nation . Additionally , the storm left $ 5 @.@ 2 million in damage in Florida , mostly inflicting citrus crops . The final storm caused several millions of dollars in damage to crops near Lake Okeechobee . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 16 , 1946 . However , tropical cyclogenesis began on June 13 , three days before the official start of the season . There was a total of seven tropical storms , slightly below the contemporaneous 20 @-@ year average of 8 @.@ 5 per season . Three of those strengthened into hurricanes , while none reached major hurricane status – Category 3 or higher on the modern @-@ day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale – for the first time since 1940 and it was a phenomenon that would not occur again until 1968 . One hurricane made landfall in the United States , while the two other storms with winds of at least 74 mph ( 119 km / h ) remained at sea during their strongest intensities . Overall in the United States , the season resulted in less than $ 10 million in damage and no deaths . Collectively , the storms of the season left at least $ 5 @.@ 2 million in damage . The final cyclone of the season dissipated on November 3 , 12 days before the official end of the season on November 15 , 1946 . 
 Tropical cyclogenesis began with the development of a tropical storm over the Gulf of Mexico on June 13 . The next system formed offshore the Southeastern United States on July 5 . Activity then ceased for nearly seven weeks , until August 25 , when the third storm originated in the Bay of Campeche . Although September is the climatological peak of hurricane season , there was only one tropical cyclone that strengthened to tropical storm status that month . The season 's most intense storm developed on September 12 and later peaked as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) and a lowest known barometric pressure of 975 millibars ( 28 @.@ 8 inHg ) . Additionally , a tropical depression briefly existed near Central America . October was the most active month of the season , with three tropical cyclones . The third storm in October , which was the last system of the season , lasted until November 3 . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 20 , the lowest total since 1925 and until 1983 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) , which is tropical storm strength .

 A disturbance accompanied by a small area of convection developed into a tropical depression about 165 miles ( 265 km ) south @-@ southwest of Cape San Blas , Florida , at 12 : 00 UTC on June 13 . Moving slowly northwestward , the depression intensified into a tropical storm early on the next day . The storm did not deepen beyond maximum sustained winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , while historical weather maps indicated a barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 014 millibars ( 29 @.@ 9 inHg ) on June 15 , the lowest in relation to the storm . Later that day , the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression offshore Louisiana . The storm made landfall just east of the Louisiana – Texas border on June 16 and rapidly dissipated . It may have remained a tropical depression throughout its lifespan but data was inconclusive . Winds of 36 mph ( 58 km / h ) were observed at Grand Isle , Louisiana , while winds of " gentle to moderate force " occurred in Texas . 
 = = = Hurricane Two = = = 
 The interaction between a frontal boundary and a tropical wave resulted in the development of an extratropical cyclone on July 5 offshore the Southeastern United States . Throughout the day , the storm acquired tropical characteristics . Around 00 : 00 UTC on July 6 , the system transitioned into a tropical storm while located about 35 mi ( 55 km ) south @-@ southeast of Myrtle Beach , South Carolina . The cyclone moved northeastward and made landfall near Oak Island , North Carolina , around 08 : 00 UTC with winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . In the state , Carolina Beach and Wrightsville Beach observed sustained winds of 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) and gusts of 50 – 60 mph ( 80 – 97 km / h ) . In the Wilmington area , winds damaged plate @-@ glass windows and caused brief disruptions to electricity and communication services . Further inland , heavy rainfall , including 7 @.@ 84 in ( 199 mm ) in less than 24 hours in Manteo , resulted in considerable loss to crops , with 15 % -20 % damaged in some areas . That was the heaviest 24 @-@ hour precipitation total recorded in Manteo since observations began in 1905 . 
 The storm moved northeastward and reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean near the southern end of Bodie Island early on July 7 . Shortly thereafter , the cyclone began strengthening and became a Category 1 hurricane by 12 : 00 UTC . After slightly further intensification , the hurricane reached peak intensity at 18 : 00 UTC on July 7 with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . It then curved eastward and began losing tropical characteristics . At 00 : 00 UTC on July 9 , the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located about 390 mi ( 630 km ) south @-@ southeast of Cape Sable Island , Nova Scotia . The extratropical remnants gradually curved northeastward and then north @-@ northeastward while slowly weakening . Late on July 10 , the extratropical storm dissipated near Cape Race , Newfoundland .

 In late August , a disturbance was monitored moving over the western Caribbean Sea near Great Swan Island . Despite favorable conditions , further development did not occur until after the it reached the Bay of Campeche . Early on August 25 , it is estimated that a tropical storm developed after a reconnaissance aircraft flight reported that the system acquired a well @-@ defined circulation . Peaking with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , the storm moved quickly west @-@ northwestward and made near Tampico , Tamaulipas , at 19 : 00 UTC . By early the next day , the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated . A wind gust of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) was observed in Tampico .

 A tropical wave over the western Caribbean Sea developed into a tropical depression about 40 mi ( 65 km ) north of the Swan Islands on September 9 .

 = = = Hurricane Four = = = 
 Early on September 12 , the northern portion of a tropical wave spawned a tropical storm about 75 mi ( 120 km ) east Andros Island . The storm strengthened while moving northeastward into the northern Bahamas , striking Andros Island later that day with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) . Late on September 12 , the cyclone strengthened into a hurricane before making landfall on South Abaco with winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . The hurricane intensified further after entering the open Atlantic , becoming on September 13 . Shortly thereafter , it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 975 mbar ( 28 @.@ 8 inHg ) , both of which were observed during a reconnaissance aircraft flight . The storm accelerated and weakened due to cooler sea surface temperatures , falling to tropical storm status early on September 15 . Shortly thereafter , the cyclone became extratropical about 170 mi ( 270 km ) south of Cape Sable Island . The extratropical remnants moved across Newfoundland and the northern Atlantic , until dissipating well north of the Azores on September 17 . 
 In the Bahamas , Hope Town observed sustained winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) and stronger gusts , as well as a barometric pressure of 995 mbar ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) . The Norwegian tanker Maril II sank after splitting into , drowning sixteen people . However , because the Maril II was over 300 mi ( 480 km ) away from the storm at the time , the incident could not be directly attributed to the hurricane . Some areas of Nova Scotia experienced strong winds , with sustained winds up to 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) observed throughout the province and a gust of 71 mph ( 114 km / h ) recorded at Sable Island . Heavy rain was also reported , with 2 @.@ 9 in ( 74 mm ) measured in Halifax . High seas during the Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron race " The Hood Cup " forced the yachts to return to port . When the radar image was taken , it was only the third time in history that a hurricane passed close enough to a radar site to reveal its structure .

 A low pressure area initially associated with two frontal systems developed into a tropical depression about 560 mi ( 900 km ) southwest of Flores Island in the Azores at 12 : 00 UTC on October 1 . After six hours , the depression intensified into a tropical storm . It intensified further while moving east @-@ northeastward . On October 2 , the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 004 mbar ( 29 @.@ 6 inHg ) , both of which were observed by ships . The storm then began losing tropical characteristics and merged with a frontal boundary around 12 : 00 UTC on October 3 while situated about 275 mi ( 445 km ) south @-@ southwest of Pico Island in the Azores . This storm was not included in HURDAT until 2014 . 
 Although the system became extratropical , it continued to deepen further , with sustained winds reaching 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) late on October 4 . Additionally , it expanded significantly in size , reaching a diameter of about 1 @,@ 035 mi ( 1 @,@ 665 km ) on October 5 . Around that time , the storm passed through the Azores near Faial Island , before weakening and dissipating north of the island chain on October 6 . Rough seas at Santa Maria Island left 120 fishermen missing , while 12 fishing vessels , 2 tugboats , and several launches were destroyed . Four fishing boats were also missing . Strong wind gusts up to 98 mph ( 158 km / h ) caused " catastrophic " damage on Santa Maria and São Miguel islands . Homes , crops , and pineapple greenhouses were demolished , while communications were knocked out . Additionally , Lajes Field on Terceira Island was " practically destroyed " .

 A disturbance from the Intertropical Convergence Zone developed into a tropical storm late on October 5 , while located over the western Caribbean Sea near the Belize – Mexico border . It moved northeastward and strengthened , reaching Category 1 hurricane status the next day . At 04 : 00 UTC on October 7 , the storm made landfall in western Cuba near Boca de <unk> , Pinar del Río Province , with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . A barometric pressure of 977 mbar ( 28 @.@ 9 inHg ) was observed , the lowest in relation to the system . Additionally , a station recorded a wind gust of 112 mph ( 180 km / h ) . Several sugar cane fields were flattened , with millions of tons of the crop destroyed . In many towns , telephone and telegraphic communications were cutoff . Five deaths occurred in Cuba . After emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on October 7 , the storm curved north @-@ northeastward and strengthened to a Category 2 , peaking with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) . 
 After becoming a Category 2 hurricane on October 7 , the cyclone weakened to a Category 1 just six hours later . Around 04 : 00 UTC on the following day , it made another landfall near Bradenton Beach , Florida , with winds of 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) . In Florida , the gusty winds and rainfall produced by the storm inflicted damage mostly on crops . About 2 % of the state 's total citrus crop was lost , with damage totaling $ 5 million . Only about $ 200 @,@ 000 in property damage occurred , which was mostly due to coastal flooding in cities such as Everglades , Fort Myers , and Punta Gorda . Moving inland , the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm later on October 8 . Early on October 9 , the system became extratropical over South Carolina . However , the extratropical remnants persisted for several days , moving in a semicircular path over the eastern Atlantic until dissipating well north of Hispaniola on October 14 .

 A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression late on October 31 over the Bahamas about halfway between Acklins and Little Inagua . The depression strengthened into a tropical storm early on November 1 and moved northwestward , striking several islands , including Acklins , Long Island , Exuma , and Andros . Late on November 1 , the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 002 mbar ( 29 @.@ 6 inHg ) . The system then made landfall near Lake Worth , Florida , at the same intensity around 22 : 00 UTC . Early on November 2 , the storm weakened to a tropical depression and recurved northeastward over Central Florida . Shortly after reemerging into the Atlantic Ocean near Ponte <unk> Beach early on November 3 , the depression dissipated about 45 mi ( 75 km ) east @-@ northeast of Fernandina Beach . 
 Due to the weak nature of the storm , no wind damage occurred . However , flooding occurred around Lake Okeechobee due to rainfall reaching 6 in ( 150 mm ) . Along main highways , several cars stalled , while a number of canal overflowed . Between 50 % <unk> % of early fall crops in the area were damaged , with as much as 60 % of snap bean crops lost . Damage was in the several millions range .

 = Aspasia = 
 Aspasia ( / <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> / ; Greek : <unk> ; c . 470 BC – c . 400 BC ) was an influential immigrant to Classical @-@ era Athens who was the lover and partner of the statesman Pericles . The couple had a son , Pericles the Younger , but the full details of the couple 's marital status are unknown . According to Plutarch , her house became an intellectual centre in Athens , attracting the most prominent writers and thinkers , including the philosopher Socrates . It has also been suggested that the teachings of Aspasia influenced Socrates . Aspasia was mentioned in the writing of philosophers Plato , Aristophanes , Xenophon , and other authors of the day . Though she spent most of her adult life in Greece , few details of her life are fully known . Some scholars suggest that Aspasia was a brother keeper and a prostitute . Aspasia 's role in history provides crucial insight to the understanding of the women of ancient Greece . Very little is known about women from her time period . One scholar stated that , " To ask questions about Aspasia 's life is to ask questions about half of humanity . " 
 = = Origin and early years = = 
 Aspasia was born in the Ionian Greek city of Miletus ( in the modern province of Aydın , Turkey ) . Little is known about her family except that her father 's name was Axiochus , although it is evident that she must have belonged to a wealthy family , for only the well @-@ to @-@ do could have afforded the excellent education that she received . Some ancient sources claim that she was a Carian prisoner @-@ of @-@ war turned slave ; these statements are generally regarded as false . 
 It is not known under what circumstances she first traveled to Athens . The discovery of a 4th @-@ century grave inscription that mentions the names of Axiochus and <unk> has led historian Peter K. Bicknell to attempt a reconstruction of Aspasia 's family background and Athenian connections . His theory connects her to Alcibiades II of <unk> ( grandfather of the famous Alcibiades ) , who was ostracized from Athens in 460 BC and may have spent his exile in Miletus . Bicknell conjectures that , following his exile , the elder Alcibiades went to Miletus , where he married the daughter of a certain Axiochus . Alcibiades apparently returned to Athens with his new wife and her younger sister , Aspasia . Bicknell argues that the first child of this marriage was named Axiochus ( uncle of the famous Alcibiades ) and the second <unk> . He also maintains that Pericles met Aspasia through his close connections with Alcibiades 's household . 
 = = Life in Athens = = 
 According to the disputed statements of the ancient writers and some modern scholars , in Athens Aspasia became a hetaera and probably ran a brothel . <unk> were professional high @-@ class entertainers , as well as courtesans . Besides displaying physical beauty , they differed from most Athenian women in being educated ( often to a high standard , as in Aspasia 's case ) , having independence , and paying taxes . They were the nearest thing perhaps to liberated women ; and Aspasia , who became a vivid figure in Athenian society , was probably an obvious example . According to Plutarch , Aspasia was compared to the famous <unk> , another renowned Ionian hetaera of ancient times . 
 Being a foreigner and possibly a hetaera , Aspasia was free of the legal restraints that traditionally confined married women to their homes , and thereby was allowed to participate in the public life of the city . She became the mistress of the statesman Pericles in the early 440s . After he divorced his first wife ( c . 445 BC ) , Aspasia began to live with him , although her marital status remains disputed . Their son , Pericles the Younger , must have been born by 440 BC . Aspasia would have to have been quite young , if she were able to bear a child to Lysicles c . 428 BC . 
 In social circles , Aspasia was noted for her ability as a conversationalist and adviser rather than merely an object of physical beauty . Plutarch writes that despite her immoral life , friends of Socrates brought their wives to hear her converse . 
 = = Personal and judicial attacks = = 
 Though they were influential , Pericles , Aspasia and their friends were not immune from attack , as preeminence in democratic Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule . Her relationship with Pericles and her subsequent political influence aroused many reactions . Donald Kagan , a Yale historian , believes that Aspasia was particularly unpopular in the years immediately following the Samian War . In 440 BC , Samos was at war with Miletus over Priene , an ancient city of Ionia in the foot @-@ hills of Mycale . <unk> in the war , the Milesians came to Athens to plead their case against the Samians . When the Athenians ordered the two sides to stop fighting and submit the case to arbitration at Athens , the Samians refused . In response , Pericles passed a decree dispatching an expedition to Samos . The campaign proved to be difficult and the Athenians had to endure heavy casualties before Samos was defeated . According to Plutarch , it was thought that Aspasia , who came from Miletus , was responsible for the Samian War , and that Pericles had decided against and attacked Samos to gratify her . 
 According to some later accounts , before the eruption of the Peloponnesian War ( 431 BC – 404 BC ) , Pericles , some of his closest associates ( including the philosopher Anaxagoras and sculptor Phidias ) and Aspasia faced a series of personal and legal attacks . Aspasia , in particular , was reportedly accused of corrupting the women of Athens in order to satisfy Pericles ' perversions . According to Plutarch , she was put on trial for impiety , with the comic poet <unk> as prosecutor . The historical nature of the accounts about these events is disputed , and apparently no harm came to her as a result . 
 In The <unk> , Aristophanes blames Aspasia for the Peloponnesian War . He claims that the Megarian decree of Pericles , which excluded Megara from trade with Athens or its allies , was retaliation for prostitutes being kidnapped from the house of Aspasia by <unk> . Aristophanes ' portrayal of Aspasia as responsible , from personal motives , for the outbreak of the war with Sparta may reflect memory of the earlier episode involving Miletus and Samos . Plutarch reports also the taunting comments of other comic poets , such as <unk> and <unk> . According to <unk> , Douris appears to have propounded the view that Aspasia instigated both the Samian and Peloponnesian Wars . 
 Aspasia was labeled the " New <unk> " , " <unk> " , " Hera " and " Helen " . Further attacks on Pericles ' relationship with Aspasia are reported by Athenaeus . Even Pericles ' own son , Xanthippus , who had political ambitions , did not hesitate to slander his father about his domestic affairs . 
 = = Later years and death = = 
 In 429 BC during the Plague of Athens , Pericles witnessed the death of his sister and of both his legitimate sons , Paralus and Xanthippus , from his first wife . With his morale undermined , he burst into tears , and not even Aspasia 's companionship could console him . Just before his death , the Athenians allowed a change in the citizenship law of 451 BC that made his half @-@ Athenian son with Aspasia , Pericles the Younger , a citizen and legitimate heir , a decision all the more striking in considering that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides . Pericles died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC . 
 Plutarch cites Aeschines Socraticus , who wrote a dialogue on Aspasia ( now lost ) , to the effect that after Pericles 's death , Aspasia lived with Lysicles , an Athenian strategos ( general ) and democratic leader , with whom she had another son ; and that she made him the first man at Athens . Lysicles was killed on expedition to levy subsidies from allies in action in 428 BC With Lysicles ' death the contemporaneous record ends . It is unknown , if she was alive when her son , Pericles , was elected general or when he was executed after the Battle of Arginusae . The time of her death that most historians give ( c . 401 BC @-@ 400 BC ) is based on the assessment that Aspasia died before the execution of Socrates in 399 BC , a chronology which is implied in the structure of Aeschines ' Aspasia . 
 = = = Ancient philosophical works = = = 
 Aspasia appears in the philosophical writings of Plato , Xenophon , Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes . Some scholars argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and based his character Diotima in the Symposium on her , while others suggest that Diotima was in fact a historical figure . According to Charles Kahn , Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania , Diotima is in many respects Plato 's response to Aeschines ' Aspasia . 
 In Menexenus , Plato satirizes Aspasia 's relationship with Pericles , and quotes Socrates as claiming ironically that she was a trainer of many orators and that since Pericles was educated by Aspasia , he would be superior in rhetoric to someone educated by Antiphon . He also attributes authorship of the Funeral Oration to Aspasia and attacks his contemporaries ' veneration of Pericles . Kahn maintains that Plato has taken from Aeschines the motif of Aspasia as teacher of rhetoric for Pericles and Socrates . Plato 's Aspasia and Aristophanes ' Lysistrata are two apparent exceptions to the rule of women 's incapacity as orators , though these fictional characters tell us nothing about the actual status of women in Athens . As Martha L. Rose , Professor of History at Truman State University , explains , " only in comedy do dogs litigate , birds govern , or women declaim " . 
 Xenophon mentions Aspasia twice in his Socratic writings : in Memorabilia and in <unk> . In both cases her advice is recommended to <unk> by Socrates . In Memorabilia Socrates quotes Aspasia as saying that the matchmaker should report truthfully on the good characteristics of the man . In <unk> Socrates defers to Aspasia as more knowledgeable about household management and the economic partnership between husband and wife . 
 Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes each named a Socratic dialogue after Aspasia ( though neither survives except in fragments ) . Our major sources for Aeschines Socraticus ' Aspasia are Athenaeus , Plutarch , and Cicero . In the dialogue , Socrates recommends that Callias send his son Hipponicus to Aspasia for instructions . When Callias recoils at the notion of a female teacher , Socrates notes that Aspasia had favorably influenced Pericles and , after his death , Lysicles . In a section of the dialogue , preserved in Latin by Cicero , Aspasia figures as a " female Socrates " , counseling first Xenophon 's wife and then Xenophon himself ( the Xenophon in question is not the famous historian ) about acquiring virtue through self @-@ knowledge . Aeschines presents Aspasia as a teacher and inspirer of excellence , connecting these virtues with her status as <unk> . According to Kahn , every single episode in Aeschines ' Aspasia is not only fictitious but incredible . 
 Of Antisthenes ' Aspasia only two or three quotations are extant . This dialogue contains much slander , but also anecdotes pertaining to Pericles ' biography . Antisthenes appears to have attacked not only Aspasia , but the entire family of Pericles , including his sons . The philosopher believes that the great statesman chose the life of pleasure over virtue . Thus , Aspasia is presented as the personification of the life of sexual indulgence . 
 = = = Modern literature = = = 
 Aspasia appears in several significant works of modern literature . Her romantic attachment with Pericles has inspired some of the most famous novelists and poets of the last centuries . In particular the romanticists of the 19th century and the historical novelists of the 20th century found in their story an inexhaustible source of inspiration . In 1835 Lydia Maria Child , an American abolitionist , novelist , and journalist , published <unk> , a classical romance set in the days of Pericles and Aspasia . This book is regarded as the most successful and elaborate of the author 's productions , because the female characters , especially Aspasia , are portrayed with great beauty and delicacy . 
 In 1836 , Walter Savage Landor , an English writer and poet , published Pericles and Aspasia , one of his most famous books . Pericles and Aspasia is a rendering of classical Athens through a series of imaginary letters , which contain numerous poems . The letters are frequently unfaithful to actual history but attempt to capture the spirit of the Age of Pericles . Robert <unk> is another novelist and poet who was inspired by Aspasia 's personality . In 1876 he published his novel Aspasia , a book about the manners and morals of the Age of Pericles and a work of cultural and historical interest . Giacomo Leopardi , an Italian poet influenced by the movement of romanticism , published a group of five poems known as the circle of Aspasia . These Leopardi poems were inspired by his painful experience of desperate and unrequited love for a woman named Fanny <unk> <unk> . Leopardi called this person Aspasia , after the companion of Pericles . 
 In 1918 , novelist and playwright George Cram Cook produced his first full @-@ length play , The Athenian Women ( an adaption of Lysistrata ) , which portrays Aspasia leading a strike for peace . Cook combined an anti @-@ war theme with a Greek setting . American writer Gertrude Atherton in The Immortal Marriage ( 1927 ) treats the story of Pericles and Aspasia and illustrates the period of the Samian War , the Peloponnesian War and the Plague of Athens . Taylor Caldwell 's Glory and the Lightning ( 1974 ) is another novel that portrays the historical relationship of Aspasia and Pericles . 
 = = Fame and assessments = = 
 Aspasia 's name is closely connected with Pericles ' glory and fame . Plutarch accepts her as a significant figure both politically and intellectually and expresses his admiration for a woman who " managed as she pleased the foremost men of the state , and afforded the philosophers occasion to discuss her in exalted terms and at great length " . The biographer says that Aspasia became so renowned that even Cyrus the Younger , who went to war with the King Artaxerxes II of Persia , gave her name to one of his concubines , who before was called <unk> . After Cyrus had fallen in battle , this woman was carried captive to the King and acquired a great influence with him . Lucian calls Aspasia a " model of wisdom " , " the admired of the admirable Olympian " and lauds " her political knowledge and insight , her shrewdness and penetration " . A Syriac text , according to which Aspasia composed a speech and instructed a man to read it for her in the courts , confirms Aspasia 's rhetorical fame . Aspasia is said by the Suda , a 10th @-@ century Byzantine encyclopedia , to have been " clever with regards to words , " a <unk> , and to have taught rhetoric . 
 On the basis of such assessments , researchers such as Cheryl Glenn , Professor at the Pennsylvania State University , argue that Aspasia seems to have been the only woman in classical Greece to have distinguished herself in the public sphere and must have influenced Pericles in the composition of his speeches . Some scholars believe that Aspasia opened an academy for young women of good families or even invented the Socratic method . However , Robert W. Wallace , Professor of classics at Northwestern University , underscores that " we cannot accept as historical the joke that Aspasia taught Pericles how to speak and hence was a master rhetorician or philosopher " . According to Wallace , the intellectual role Aspasia was given by Plato may have derived from comedy . Kagan describes Aspasia as " a beautiful , independent , brilliantly witty young woman capable of holding her own in conversation with the best minds in Greece and of discussing and illuminating any kind of question with her husband " . Roger Just , a classicist and Professor of social anthropology at the University of Kent , believes that Aspasia was an exceptional figure , but her example alone is enough to underline the fact that any woman who was to become the intellectual and social equal of a man would have to be a hetaera . According to Sr. Prudence Allen , a philosopher and seminary professor , Aspasia moved the potential of women to become philosophers one step forward from the poetic inspirations of Sappho .

 = = Historicity of her life = = 
 The main problem remains , as Jona <unk> points out , that most of the things we know about Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis . Thucydides does not mention her ; our only sources are the untrustworthy representations and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy , who did not care at all about Aspasia as a historical character . Therefore , in the figure of Aspasia , we get a range of contradictory portrayals ; she is either a good wife like <unk> or some combination of courtesan and prostitute like <unk> . This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia 's life . 
 According to Wallace , " for us Aspasia herself possesses and can possess almost no historical reality " . Hence , Madeleine M. Henry , Professor of Classics at Iowa State University , maintains that " biographical anecdotes that arose in antiquity about Aspasia are wildly colorful , almost completely unverifiable , and still alive and well in the twentieth century " . She finally concludes that " it is possible to map only the barest possibilities for [ Aspasia 's ] life " . According to Charles W. <unk> and Loren J. Samons II , Professors of Classics and history , " it may well be , for all we know , that the real Aspasia was more than a match for her fictional counterpart " . 
 = Briarcliff Farms = 
 Briarcliff Farms was a farm established in 1890 by Walter William Law in Briarcliff Manor , a village in Westchester County , New York . One of several enterprises established by Law at the turn of the 20th century , the farm was known for its milk , butter , and cream and also produced other dairy products , American Beauty roses , bottled water , and print media . At its height , the farm was one of the largest dairy operations in the Northeastern United States , operating about 8 @,@ 000 acres ( 10 sq mi ) with over 1 @,@ 000 Jersey cattle . In 1907 , the farm moved to Pine Plains in New York 's Dutchess County , and it was purchased by New York banker Oakleigh Thorne in 1918 , who developed it into an Angus cattle farm . After Thorne 's death in 1948 , the farm changed hands several times ; in 1968 it became Stockbriar Farm , a beef feeding operation . Stockbriar sold the farmland to its current owners in 1979 . 
 The farm combined a practical American business model with the concept of a European country seat or manor , with cows being milked constantly , and with milk promptly chilled and bottled within five minutes , and shipped to stores in New York City each night . The farm was progressive , with sterile conditions , numerous employee benefits , good living conditions for livestock , and regular veterinary inspections to maintain a healthy herd . The farm also made use of tenant farming , established working blacksmith , wheelwright , and harness shops on @-@ site , was located around Walter Law 's manor house , and constructed numerous buildings in the Tudor Revival architectural style . 
 Briarcliff Farms was the original location for the School of Practical Agriculture and Horticulture , established by the New York State Committee for the Promotion of Agriculture in conjunction with Walter Law . The school 's purpose was to teach students in farming , gardening , poultry @-@ keeping , and other agriculture @-@ related skills . The school moved to a farm near Poughkeepsie in 1903 , and the school building was run as a hotel for two years until it became Miss Knox 's School . After the building burned down in 1912 , Miss Knox 's School was relocated several times ; since 1954 , the Knox School has been located in St. James , New York .

 James Stillman owned a small farm on Pleasantville Road since at least 1886 . It was known as Briarcliff Farm after John David Ogilby 's estate , Brier Cliff ( itself named after Ogilby 's family home in Ireland ) . In 1887 Stillman had a display at the Great Dairy and Cattle Show in New York City 's Madison Square Garden , where he demonstrated setting milk , churning cream and making butter . In 1890 , Walter Law began purchasing property in the present @-@ day village of Briarcliff Manor as part of his desire for rest and recreation . That year , Law paid James Stillman $ 35 @,@ 000 ( $ 921 @,@ 800 in 2015 ) for his 236 @-@ acre ( 96 ha ) farm and renamed it Briarcliff Farms . In 1893 , The New York Times reported that the 14th Duke of Veragua ( a livestock farmer ) and a large party visited the farm on the afternoon of June 16 ; at that time , the farm had about 330 cattle and 100 sheep . The party went from New York to Scarborough , proceeding by carriage to Briarcliff , and visited the farm 's poultry yard , <unk> and stables . After observing the farm 's heifers and stallions , they went to the creamery to taste Briarcliff butter . The guests went to Law 's Yonkers home , Hillcrest , for dinner before returning to New York . After the visit , the duke had said " Well , this is a perfect place . I am delighted with what I have seen . " 
 In 1898 Law retired from the vice @-@ presidency of W. & J. Sloane , moved with his family to the area and began devoting his time to agriculture . He rapidly added to his holdings , buying about forty parcels in less than ten years ; by 1900 , Law owned more than 5 @,@ 000 acres ( 8 sq mi ) of Westchester County and was its largest individual landholder . Some previous owners became tenant farmers ; Law received half of the hay and straw from a 160 @-@ acre ( 60 ha ) farm formerly owned by Jesse Bishop , and one @-@ third of everything else . Law and Briarcliff Farms initially deepened the Pocantico River for 2 miles ( 3 km ) , taking out rifts so the stream would flow and adjacent swamps would drain . Workers also cut rock and took out trees lining the swamps to reclaim land for farming . 
 Law found the soil poor , since it had been farmed for a half @-@ century . The fields were bare , and cows gave poor @-@ quality milk : " I had to begin at the bottom and repair the waste of fifty years . " He improved the soil 's fertility by arranging for manure from New York City streets and stables to be regularly brought to his farm ; for four years , twenty carloads of manure a week were spread on the land . As a result , the farm 's hay yield increased from two to five tons . Law also decided to improve the area 's roads , giving them a base layer of large , closely packed stones and layers of top gravel . He developed his herd ; at first the farm had weak cattle ( many afflicted with tuberculosis ) and " ordinary milk " , but after Law 's development the farm had strong cattle , healthy calves and an abundance of rich milk . Law hired Leonard Pearson ( a professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Pennsylvania ) to check each cow every six months for tuberculosis and other diseases , exceeding New York City Board of Health standards . 
 Although Law had little knowledge or experience of farming at first , he had enough money to reach his goal of maximizing his dairy farm 's quality and output . Law 's farm had 500 workers tending cattle , pigs , chickens , Thoroughbred horses , pheasants , peacocks and sheep at its peak . In 1900 , when the US government asked Briarcliff Farms to exhibit its milk , butter and cream at Paris ' Exposition Universelle , the farm submitted raw , pasteurized , and sterilized milk ; however , according to the French , " There is no use sending these , for your fresh milk keeps fresh " . The farm contributed to the USDA Bureau of Animal Industry and the New York State Commission to the Paris Exhibition 's joint exhibit , winning gold medals for its milk , cream , and butter and a silver medal for social benefit or economy . Concerned that the farm 's milk had preservatives , French authorities requested an affidavit that no chemicals were added . Photographs by the US government of Briarcliff Farms ' barns , farmland , Law 's mottoes and employees were displayed in the exposition 's Palace of Social Economy and Congress . 
 On September 2 , 1901 , the farm 's dairy buildings were destroyed by fire . The cause of the fire ( which was discovered in the dairy building 's tower ) was unknown , and the damage was covered by insurance . Law quickly arranged for a temporary dairy in a room of the electric plant which had a boiler for sterilization ; by the afternoon , milk was processed as usual . A larger dairy building was planned closer to the railroad station for faster shipping . 
 When Briarcliff Manor was incorporated on November 21 , 1902 , Law owned all but two small parcels of the square @-@ mile village and employed nearly all of its residents ( around 100 ) . He developed the village , establishing schools , churches , parks and the Briarcliff Lodge . The population grew , encouraging Law to incorporate the area as a village . A proposition was presented to the supervisors of Mount Pleasant and Ossining on October 8 , 1902 that a 640 @-@ acre ( 260 ha ) area with a population of 331 be incorporated as the Village of Briarcliff Manor , and it was incorporated on November 21 . That year Law 's son , Walter Jr . , joined his father and brother Henry in managing the farm and realty company ; he was the second village president , in office from 1905 to 1918 . 
 In April 1906 , Governor General of Canada Albert Grey and US Representative and farm architect Edward Burnett drove up from New York City and toured the farm as guests of Walter Law . According to Briarcliff Outlook , they " expressed hearty approval of Briarcliff ways " . 
 = = = Relocation to Pine Plains = = = 
 Law developed his Briarcliff Manor property primarily as a corporation until 1907 when , due to rising property values and falling agricultural development in Westchester County , he purchased twelve farms — totaling 3 @,@ 249 acres ( 5 sq mi ) — for Briarcliff Farms on both sides of the Pine Plains @-@ Stanford Road ( present @-@ day New York State Route 82 ) in Pine Plains and began developing his Briarcliff Manor properties for houses , churches and schools . Law 's general manager , George W. Tuttle ( who had worked at Briarcliff Farms since 1901 ) , arranged the Pine Plains purchases and the construction of new barns , a creamery , a power station and other buildings . The barns used Franklin Hiram King 's King ventilation system , and the concrete dairy building cost about $ 25 @,@ 000 ( $ 658 @,@ 400 in 2015 ) . The farm 's well , 700 feet ( 210 m ) from the barn , was 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) deep and 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) in diameter . 
 In 1907 and 1908 , the farm and many of its workers moved to Pine Plains . Although preliminary steps in the relocation were primarily small , the final October 1908 transfer used two trains to move 300 cattle . The rest of the cattle were transferred a day later , to the farm 's main station ( between Pine Plains and <unk> on the Central New England Railway ) at Barn A. During Briarcliff Manor 's first automobile race in 1908 , the barns were used for mechanic crews and each driver had his own crew weeks before the race . In 1909 Law formed the Briarcliff Realty Company to sell the original Briarcliff Manor property . He sold the Pine Plains property in 1918 and died in 1924 . 
 On October 9 , 1918 , New York banker Oakleigh Thorne and several partners purchased the 4 @,@ 200 @-@ acre ( 7 sq mi ) Briarcliff Farms property , cattle and dairy buildings for $ 500 @,@ 000 ( $ 7 @.@ 87 million in 2015 ) . Thorne began breeding Aberdeen Angus cattle under the Briarcliff Farms name , and the farm remained well known for its beef . Thorne and W. Alan McGregor began the herd by importing cattle from Scotland in 1925 , and enlarged it through breeding . The Aberdeen Angus industry became prominent in the United States due to Briarcliff Farms ; in 1955 , about 95 percent of US Angus cattle were from Briarcliff stock . 
 Thorne hired William Harper Pew for Pew 's knowledge of livestock bloodlines . At the time , the farm had over 5 @,@ 000 acres ( 8 sq mi ) and 1 @,@ 000 purebred Aberdeen Angus cattle ( the largest Aberdeen Angus herd in the country ) . Pew began eighteen Angus herds in Dutchess County , and was a director of the American Angus Association . At the International Livestock Show in 1927 , the farm had the International Grand Champion Female , and in 1930 it had the 1930 International Grand Champion Bull . Because of the 1931 and 1933 expositions , Thorne became first to win a grand champion twice , with two of his livestock awarded International Grand Champion Steers . At the 1934 Dutchess County Fair 's beef @-@ cattle show , 100 cattle and steers were exhibited . Briarcliff <unk> , a summer yearling weighing 1 @,@ 000 pounds ( 450 kg ) , was named the grand champion steer . The grand champion bull was the farm 's Briarcliff Barbarian 8th , the first @-@ prize senior yearling of the 1933 International Livestock Show . The grand champion female was Briarcliff <unk> 10th , the first @-@ prize senior yearling heifer of the 1933 international show . 
 The farm had an impact on a number of herds , and the Briarcliff prefix is still seen in many pedigrees . In 1935 the 2 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 3 sq mi ) portion of the farm east of the road was sold to Henry Jackson , who named it Bethel Farms . After Thorne 's death in 1948 , Briarcliff Farms changed hands a number of times . In 1968 it became Stockbriar Farm , a beef @-@ feeding operation . Stockbriar tried to sell the farm several times , and it nearly became a county zoo . In 1979 , Stockbriar sold the farmland to the Conservation and Preservation Association ( CAPA ) for $ 2 @.@ 1 million ( $ 6 @.@ 85 million in 2015 ) . 
 In 1982 CAPA hired a Millbrook realtor , who advertised the farm for $ 2 @.@ 75 million ( $ 6 @.@ 74 million in 2015 ) in The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal and newspapers published by Taconic Press . Around that time Stockbriar Farms filed four lawsuits against CAPA and its lessee ( Mashomack Fish and Game Preserve ) over the Pine Plains farm , claiming that the preserve operated a private club without a liquor permit and CAPA missed a March 23 , 1982 payment which was the bulk of its total payment for the farm . Stockbriar Farms requested that Mashomack be evicted , and its property returned . One lawsuit was filed in county court , and the other three were filed in New York Supreme Court . Although Mashomack and CAPA won the first two , in 1984 a state supreme court justice ordered Mashomack and CAPA to vacate the property and Stockbriar Farms remained for sale .

 The farm , overlooking the Hudson River , was established between the Hudson and Pocantico Rivers in the hamlet of Whitson 's Corners ( present @-@ day Briarcliff Manor ) , 27 miles ( 40 km ) from Manhattan . Its location was described in 1901 as " the most healthy , hilly portion of Westchester ... where there are neither swamps nor contaminated streams of water " . The original land plot , four miles ( 6 @,@ 400 m ) long and three miles ( 4 @,@ 800 m ) wide , was developed within twelve years . In 1901 , Briarcliff Farms ( including its school farm ) encompassed 6 @,@ 000 acres ( 9 sq mi ) between Pleasantville and Old Briarcliff Roads north of Scarborough Road . At its peak , its original location covered 7 @,@ 800 acres ( 10 sq mi ) . In Briarcliff Manor , the farm had six main barns : Barn A , near its office building on Pleasantville Road , housed the horses for the farm and the Briarcliff Lodge . The farm 's blacksmith , wheelwright , harness shops and other buildings were located around that barn , and a smokehouse and butcher 's shop were on @-@ site . Barns B ( housing 78 cattle ) and C ( housing 118 cattle ) were at the south end of Dalmeny Road ; Barn D ( housing 116 cattle ) , between Beech Hill Road and New York State Route 117 , was later used as a boarding stable for horses . Barn E ( housing 118 cattle ) was on Pleasantville Road just east of the present Taconic State Parkway , and Barn F ( housing 118 cattle ) was in Millwood near the intersection of the Taconic and New York State Route 100 . The farm also had a large barn near New York State Route 9A for supplies , including feed for the farm . Each barn had an ice shed to cool milk ; ice was harvested primarily from Echo Lake ( source of the Pocantico River ) , with <unk> Lake ( now part of the Edith Macy Conference Center ) as a supplemental source . The farm had a large supply store , with feed and other items , southeast of the service station at North State and Pleasantville Roads . 
 The Briarcliff Farms office , Walter Law 's personal office , was also the first dairy building ; it burned down in 1901 , and was rebuilt the following year . From Briarcliff Manor 's 1902 incorporation to the construction of its first municipal building in 1913 , the office housed the village government . During the 1960s the building was redesigned , rebuilt and became a local union headquarters for the International Union of Operating Engineers . The farm was enclosed , and its pastures were divided by stone walls from within the farm ; the stones were also used for roadbeds , and for walls of the farm buildings , office , and Law 's house . 
 Walter Law encouraged his Briarcliff Farms employees to move into the village , selling 2 @,@ 500 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 230 m2 ) or 11 @,@ 250 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 045 m2 ) plots of land to workers for a nominal price . He asked workers to choose the type of house they wanted ; he would have it built and hold the mortgage , or allow them to rent a cottage . Law built several wood @-@ framed cottages near the farms , with steep front @-@ gable roofs and open porches using some of the first @-@ floor space . Of the cottages still standing , six are on Dalmeny Road and three are on Old Briarcliff Road . The farm also owned and operated a farm in Peekskill previously owned by John Paulding , a militiaman who helped capture British major John André , running the Peekskill farm as a nursery for maples , oaks , <unk> , hemlocks , spruces and other trees . During the early 1900s Law purchased farms in <unk> and Pound Ridge , using those farms to replenish the main farm 's cattle herd . He also purchased a house in Pound Ridge , which his Briarcliff Realty Company sold to Westchester County after his death ; it became the headquarters of the Ward Pound Ridge Reservation , the county 's largest park . 
 = = = = Dalmeny = = = = 
 Walter Law provided Dalmeny , a boarding house on Dalmeny Road , for the farm 's single men . The building , modeled after the Mills Houses in New York City , was 100 feet ( 30 m ) long and four stories tall . Its first floor had a social hall for meetings and entertainment , a parlor and reading room equipped with books , newspapers , magazines , and games , a large dining room , a private dining room , a kitchen and a bathroom with marble basins and clean towels . The upper floors had seventy individual bedrooms for the men , with bathrooms with showers and tubs on every floor . Dalmeny also had a resident barber . Farm workers were not required to live in the boarding house , although the number of people wanting to live there exceeded the space available . Rent was $ 15 – 18 per month , including room , board and laundry . Law frequently joined the men at meals , lecturers visited the boarding house and the farm workers had a performing orchestra , brass band and glee club . 
 Dalmeny opened on Christmas 1899 and closed in July 1908 , in conjunction with the farm 's relocation to Upstate New York . Over a period of several months in 1909 the building was moved to the Briarcliff Lodge property , where it was adjacent to the Lodge 's laundry building . When the Lodge was the campus of King 's College from 1955 to 1994 , the school called the former boarding house Harmony Hall and used it for classrooms and staff housing . In autumn 1979 , King 's College demolished the building shortly after dedicating a new classroom building . 
 = = = Pine Plains = = = 
 Briarcliff Farms ' second location , in the town of Pine Plains , initially covered 3 @,@ 249 acres ( 5 sq mi ) . The farm , 2 miles ( 3 km ) from the hamlet of Pine Plains , was adjacent to the Central New England Railway in the shallow <unk> Basin and 12 miles ( 20 km ) from the Hudson River . The Pine Plains farm had three barns , each built at a cost of about $ 20 @,@ 000 ( $ 526 @,@ 700 in 2015 ) and housing 200 Jersey cattle bedded in sawdust or shavings . Barn B was in the Pine Plains hamlet of Bethel and Barn C was farther south , in the town of Stanford . 
 = = Operations = = 
 The farm utilized the concept of a European country seat , through tenant farming , established blacksmith , wheelwright , and harness shops on @-@ site , in addition to a butcher shop and smokehouse . Buildings were centrally located around Walter Law 's manor house , many of which were constructed in the Tudor Revival style . The farm 's office building , Dysart House , the Briarcliff Lodge , and the railroad station shared that architectural style . 
 The farm , one of the first producers of certified milk in the US , operated under the supervision of the Milk Commission of the Medical Society of the County of New York . With the farm producing about 4 @,@ 500 US quarts ( 4 @,@ 300 litres ) of milk daily ( an average of 8 US quarts ( 7 @.@ 6 litres ) per cow per day ) , Briarcliff Farms was one of the largest dairy operations in the northeast . According to Nebraska 's department of agriculture in 1903 , the three largest owners of dairy cows in the eastern US were Fairfield Farm Dairy in New Jersey , Briarcliff Farms and the Walker @-@ Gordon Laboratory Company ( which had " branches in all of the principal cities " ) . In 1897 the farm had Jersey , <unk> and <unk> cattle , selling the breeds ' milk for 10 , 12 and 15 cents per quart respectively . Briarcliff Farms also sold cream ( with 50 percent butterfat ) for 60 cents per quart , Jersey butter for 50 cents per pound and <unk> or <unk> butter for 60 cents per pound . In 1909 , half the farm 's herd consisted of registered Jerseys and the other half high @-@ grade Jerseys . In Pine Plains , many of Barn B 's milkers were from the Netherlands because of that country 's reputation for good milkers . 
 In 1905 , Briarcliff Farms was milking nearly 500 cows at any given time . The farm raised its own stock , feeding the cattle eight pounds of dry feed twice a day with pasture and green corn in summer . The feed mixture was 50 percent bran , 25 percent crushed oats and 25 percent cornmeal , all of which were claimed to be the best available . The farm required that each cow produce 6 @,@ 000 pounds of milk with 5 percent butterfat or 5 @,@ 000 pounds of milk with 6 percent butterfat , or she would be butchered or sold . Each cow ate an average of seven pounds of grain per day ( varying from two pounds on pasture to 12 in winter ) , 1 @.@ 5 to 2 pounds of oil meal each day and free @-@ choice timothy and clover hay — 17 – 20 pounds ( 7 @.@ 7 – 9 @.@ 1 kg ) daily , depending on size . Each worker milked , cleaned and groomed 16 to 18 cattle daily . The New York Milk Commission analyzed the farm 's milk weekly ; although the board of health regulations in New York allowed three million bacteria per cubic centimeter in milk , the milk commission limited bacteria to 30 @,@ 000 . The farm chilled its milk within two minutes of milking to 45 ° F ( 7 ° C ) , often limiting its bacteria counts to 200 – 400 per cc . A chemical analysis of the milk was performed every month ; although regulations required a minimum of three percent butterfat , Briarcliff required its milk to have over five percent butterfat to be sold . A March 1905 New York Milk Commission analysis indicated that the farm 's milk had 8 @.@ 2 percent butterfat , the " richest Briarcliff product ever reported on " . 
 In 1901 the farm had 1 @,@ 045 Jersey cattle , 4 @,@ 000 chickens and ducks , 1 @,@ 500 pigs , and 400 sheep . It grew , with 500 workers tending those animals in addition to Thoroughbred horses , pheasants and peacocks . The pigs ( which included Chester Whites and Berkshires ) lived outdoors , because the farm superintendent believed they should be penned only for breeding ; in summer , they were allowed to run in the orchards or the woods . About 2 @,@ 000 were butchered each year . The farm 's 31 poultry houses had a head <unk> and 40 assistants ; each building was 18 by 100 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 by 30 @.@ 5 m ) , and they were spread around the property . The farm , which used 300 @-@ egg insulators , fed the hens a mix of grains ( including oats , wheat and corn ) five times a day . The farm butchered 7 @,@ 000 broilers each season . Eggs sold for 35 to 50 cents per dozen , with demand exceeding supply . Broilers sold for $ 1 @.@ 50 ( $ 43 in 2015 ) to $ 3 @.@ 00 ( $ 85 in 2015 ) per pair . Briarcliff Farms raised about 300 lambs each spring , primarily Dorset Horns . The lambs , which were dressed ( their internal organs removed ) on the farm , sold for $ 12 ( $ 341 in 2015 ) or more apiece ; demand also exceeded supply . 
 The farm gardens grew a variety of crops , adapting to the market ; in 1900 this included oats , rye , corn , wheat , buckwheat , carrots , <unk> , turnips , rutabagas , radishes , sugar beets , potatoes , apples , cabbages , rye , oat , and wheat straw , hay , corn stalks and silage . The farm rotated its grain production to grow better vegetables . At one time the farm had 12 acres ( 0 @.@ 02 sq mi ) of asparagus , which sold for 35 to 50 cents per bunch . 
 Briarcliff Farms operated a printing press and office north of the farm office on Pleasantville Road . The print shop produced Briarcliff Farms , the Briarcliff Bulletin in 1900 , the monthly Briarcliff Outlook in 1903 and The Briarcliff Once @-@ a @-@ Week in 1908 ( all edited by Arthur W. Emerson ) and bottle caps for Briarcliff dairy products . The Briarcliff Table Water Company sold its products in New York City , Lakewood , New Jersey and the Westchester municipalities of Yonkers , Tarrytown , White Plains , and Ossining . The company owned 250 @-@ foot @-@ deep ( 76 m ) wells . Around 1901 , the Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1 ( later the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department ) housed its equipment and horses at Briarcliff Farms ' Barn A. The American <unk> Syndicate , a producer of the dried milk product <unk> , had its factory in Briarcliff for milk from Briarcliff Farms ; the farm built the factory and its power plant . 
 In a 1900 publication the farm 's motto was reported to be " The production of pure food of the highest standard of excellence " , although a 1902 publication reported that its motto was " Do unto a cow as you would that a cow would do unto you " ( also saying that the motto appeared in large letters in every barn on the farm ) . Notices printed by the farm began with the verse , " If a Cobbler by trade , I 'll make it my pride , the best of all Cobblers to be ; and if only a Tinker , no Tinker on earth shall mend an old Kettle like me " ; this verse and several other mottoes decorated friezes on the interior walls of the Dalmeny boarding house . 
 = = = Processing and delivery = = = 
 At its peak , the farm delivered milk to areas from Albany to New York City . After it was cooled , the milk was brought daily to the dairy @-@ processing building , where it was poured into a large , sterilized tank and forced — with compressed air at 160 US quarts ( 150 @,@ 000 ml ) per minute — through sterilized pipes to the building 's second floor . There the milk was cooled , strained five times and bottled . The bottles were sealed with parchment circles with the supervising commission 's certification and the date , and then put in boxes with ice . The entire process , from entering the building to bottling , took five minutes . Every utensil contacting the milk ( or workers ) would be regularly sterilized with live steam . The building was as free of bacteria as the farm could make it ; its rooms had white @-@ tiled walls and floors , with coving ( concave tiling ) between the walls and floors for better cleaning . Milk bottles were reused after several cleanings with rotating wire brushes and two hours of heat sterilization . 
 The farm 's products were packaged as milk , cream , butter or kumyss , and sent every night on the New York and Putnam Railroad to New York City for delivery the next day ; they were also sold in the farm 's stores or from wagons . Briarcliff Farms had three stores in New York City and stores in Greenwich , Connecticut , Yonkers , Dobbs Ferry and Tarrytown . The farm 's first New York City store was in Manhattan 's Windsor Arcade , at Fifth Avenue and 46th Street , and it had an office in the Seymour Building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street . The office produced advertisements for the New @-@ York Tribune , The New York Times , New York Evening Post and the Mail and Express ( papers which , according to Printers ' Ink , advertised to wealthy residents ) . The farm 's stores sold Briarcliff dairy products and table water . Milk was sent to the Hotel Lorraine , the St. Regis , the Waldorf Astoria , Mendel 's Lunch Room at Grand Central Station [ sic ] and <unk> 's Drug Store on Broadway , and kumyss was sent to seventeen New York City <unk> . Milk was sold to stores in New York free on board for $ 0 @.@ 084 ( $ 2 @.@ 13 in 2015 ) per quart . The farm also supplied the Briarcliff Lodge with cream , milk , butter , eggs and vegetables . It shipped its products in zinc @-@ lined cases on ocean @-@ going steamers and shipped nationwide every day except Sunday ( shipping a double order on Saturday ) . The farm 's milk was processed into milk , cheese , butter or buttermilk at its Barn A creamery in Pine Plains , and packaged for its 101 @-@ mile ( 200 km ) rail shipment to New York City .

 In 1906 , Andrew Carnegie wrote about Briarcliff Farms : " Every known appliance or mode of treatment is at hand , and the herd is pronounced free from all and every ailment . In cases of doubt animals are sacrificed " . The farm used the best obtainable stock , with extensive experimenting , for its products . The operation immediately removed every cow that appeared ill , and many cattle were butchered during the farm 's first few years to improve the herd 's overall health . According to Walter Law , " It is not the cows that have been put in , but those which have been taken out , that have made the Briarcliff herd what it is " . The farm 's large , light barns had concrete floors , which were cleaned daily , and up @-@ to @-@ date appliances for separating , churning , handling and packing its products . 
 Law made annual five @-@ dollar cash awards ( $ 142 in 2015 ) to workers in September ( giving them out at Dalmeny on December 24 ) , which included " most gentle with cows " , " most careful teamster in feeding his horses and keeping his stables clean " , " cleanest delivery wagon " , " neatest house yard " , " best garden truck " and " best @-@ kept room in Dalmeny " ; the farm emphasized the commercial value of such virtues . On Christmas Eve , after the Briarcliff Orchestra played George Frideric Handel 's " Largo " , Law spoke about the farm 's improvements that year and awarded the prizes . The orchestra was made up of the farm 's workers , and among its members was Law 's son Walter Jr . 
 Briarcliff Farms intended to prove that optimal farming practices could be profitable . Law believed that kind treatment would produce better cattle , and was intolerant of animal abuse : " Cruelty to a cow is the same as cruelty to me , and shall never be permitted on this farm . " He knew everyone who lived at the farms , and the farm workers knew the name of each cow ( which was on a brass plate at the front of the cow 's stall ) . The cows were sponged several times a day , and workers wore white cotton suits which were sterilized daily by boiling . Law treated his workers as intelligent co @-@ workers , rather than laborers . Each cow was groomed before milking , and a pail of warm water and a brush would then be used on her sides , flanks and udders . The flank and udder were washed again with a one @-@ percent <unk> solution , rinsed and dried . Workers would milk into a fine wire strainer placed over a pail ; during milking no talking , laughing , smoking or spitting was permitted , since such behavior was claimed to have a " perceptible effect upon their milk " . The workers were required to wash their hands thoroughly after cleaning the udders and before milking each cow . Each worker had a set of towels and washed , cared for and milked 15 or 16 cows . The cattle grazed from early spring until late autumn , and were in the barns only for milking . In 1901 , The Trained Nurse and Hospital Review said it doubted that any other large New York @-@ area dairy did this . 
 The farm had a veterinary chemist and a laboratory for regular milk analysis . Its dairy plant had a visitor @-@ observation area , permitting the viewing of each step of the farm 's dairy processing . In one room ( separated from the viewing area by glass doors ) , cream was skimmed ; in a second milk was bottled , and in a third butter was churned . The building 's sterilizing , <unk> , and shipping departments were in the basement . Briarcliff Farms shipped 2 @,@ 000 US quarts ( 1 @,@ 900 l ) of milk , 300 US quarts ( 280 l ) of cream and 500 pounds ( 230 kg ) of butter each day . Students from the Ethical Culture School and nurses from New York City hospitals visited the farm to learn about its practices in relation to their work , and Briarcliff Farms was reportedly chosen as the most typical New York industry available for inspection .

 Although Briarcliff Farms ' primary operation was dairy , a secondary agricultural product was its American Beauty rose . The farm had two groups of greenhouses ; one , behind Walter Law 's house and west of the Briarcliff Lodge , produced decorations for Briarcliff Farms , the Briarcliff Lodge and Law 's and his workers ' houses . The other group , the Pierson commercial greenhouses , grew the American Beauty rose and rare carnations ; it produced 22 varieties and about 2 @,@ 500 blooms a day . The greenhouses , advanced for their time , had light steel frames and glass panes unique in their " almost <unk> exposure to the light " . The newer greenhouses , 50 by 300 feet ( 15 by 91 m ) , held up to 40 @,@ 000 plants apiece . The Pierson roses , which earned up to $ 100 @,@ 000 ( $ 2 @.@ 84 million in 2015 ) a year , were sold in winter for eight to 12 cents each with most shipped to New York City . The Briarcliff Lodge sponsored an annual American Beauty carnival with a golf tournament , water sports , moonlight bathing and night diving , a dinner dance , a cinema program and a concert . 
 Greenhouse foreman George Romaine propagated an American Beauty rose with longer , more @-@ pointed buds and a brighter color , and Paul M. Pierson registered it with the American Rose Society as the Briarcliff Rose . It is Briarcliff Manor 's village symbol , and since 2006 has been used on village street signs . Although the Briarcliff Manor Garden Club also uses the Briarcliff Rose as its symbol , the variety is now lost .

 During the winter of 1895 @-@ 96 , the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor researched the causes of youth moving from the country to cities to develop the most efficient method of attracting them back to the country . That , and an examination of agricultural needs for a year , resulted in meetings at the homes of Abram S. Hewitt and R. Fulton Cutting and the formation of the New York State Committee for the Promotion of Agriculture . The committee , chaired by Hewitt , included Cutting , Jacob H. Schiff , John G. Carlisle , Mrs. Seth Low , Josephine Shaw Lowell , Walter Law and William E. Dodge . Its board of trustees had five officers ( with Theodore L. Van Norden president ) and seventeen other trustees , including Law , V. Everit Macy and James Speyer . George T. Powell , a " recognized authority on scientific agriculture " according to The New York Times , was consulted ; he later organized the school and became its director . When Walter Law was included the school took shape , since he provided its land and building . In September 1900 , Law and the committee established the School of Practical Agriculture and Horticulture as part of Briarcliff Farms , on an elevated 66 @-@ acre ( 27 ha ) site about midway between the Briarcliff Manor and Pleasantville train stations on Pleasantville Road . Law leased the 66 acres ( which were worth $ 1 @,@ 000 ( $ 28 @,@ 400 in 2015 ) an acre ) for 20 years at the rate of a dollar per year , gave the trustees $ 30 @,@ 000 ( $ 853 @,@ 300 in 2015 ) to build a dormitory and promised them $ 3 @,@ 000 ( $ 85 @,@ 300 in 2015 ) a year for expenses until the school earned a profit . With that and $ 30 @,@ 000 from the trustees , the school opened ; the committee focused the curriculum on horticulture , floriculture , gardening and aviculture . The school 's progress was followed by members of the public interested in agricultural education . 
 When it was founded , the school was considered an experiment . Its goal was " to open an independent means of livelihood for young men and women , especially of our cities ; to demonstrate that higher values may be obtained from land under intelligent management , and to develop a taste for rural life . " Most students were trained in garden and farm operations in a two @-@ year course , with short summer courses in nature study also offered . The academic year had three terms , with twelve weeks of vacation . Although the school allowed new students to begin at any term , a September start was considered the most desirable . Instruction was offered in agriculture , horticulture , cold storage , botany , chemistry , geology , physics , agricultural zoology , entomology , beekeeping , meteorology , land surveying and leveling , soils , drainage , irrigation , tillage , fertilizers , plant diseases , stock , fruit growing , landscape gardening and bookkeeping . It was a practical school , with no attempt to provide a general education . Work included caring for orchard trees and bush fruit , greenhouse culture of fruits and vegetables , <unk> and jam @-@ making , market gardening , tillage , fertilizer use , hybridizing and propagating flowers , harvesting and marketing crops . The school used Briarcliff Farms , where students worked the land , tested milk and cared for a variety of animals . Students also raised flowers , vegetables and fruit , and accompanied their products to cities for marketing . The New York Botanical Garden arranged with the school for student access to its lectures , museums and conservatories . Tuition was $ 100 a year ( $ 2 @,@ 800 in 2015 ) , and board $ 280 a year ( $ 8 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) . Instruction was primarily weekday @-@ morning lectures with laboratory work ; during the afternoon , students worked on the school farm ( which had a foreman , gardener and several workmen to ensure continuous operation ) under instructor supervision . In 1901 35 students attended , followed by 34 in 1902 ( almost all from cities ) , ranging in age from 16 to 35 . Most had a high @-@ school education before enrolling , and some had been to college . The school had a capacity of 35 students , and planned to expand . 
 For one year it met in the basement of Pleasantville 's public school ( until the Briarcliff Farms building was completed ) , and did not provide housing . The farm building was completed in spring 1901 and dedicated on May 15 . The large Colonial Revival building , with a plain exterior and wide halls , had lecture halls , a library , a laboratory , an office , a dining hall and dormitory space for 40 staff members and students . Its grounds had an orchard , a working garden , experimental greenhouses , poultry houses , a farmhouse and barns . The school 's faculty included a director , a horticulturalist , an agriculturalist and instructors in nature study and cold storage . It was coeducational , with identical courses for men and women . Students were required to be proficient in English , provide good references , be at least 16 years of age , and be in good health . On January 1 , 1902 Henry Francis du Pont , then in his third year at Harvard University , wrote to Powell requesting admission to the school ; Powell replied that DuPont was listed first in the school 's 1903 class . However , DuPont was unable to attend and left Harvard ( perhaps due to his mother 's sudden death in autumn 1902 ) .

 The school outgrew its Briarcliff location , and in autumn 1902 R. Fulton Cutting purchased a 415 @-@ acre ( 168 ha ) farm near Poughkeepsie as a permanent upstate location . It had been popularly known as the Briarcliff School , and after the move it was formally known as the School of Practical Agriculture at Poughkeepsie . When the school was established , Theodore Van Norden said that it needed funds for equipment and an endowment . The land had no buildings , and the school rented two houses in Poughkeepsie until funds were obtained to build . It initially hoped to raise one million dollars ; in 1903 , after raising $ 50 @,@ 000 ( $ 1 @.@ 32 million in 2015 ) of a hoped @-@ for $ 150 @,@ 000 ( $ 3 @.@ 95 million in 2015 ) to operate the school , director George Powell announced that it would close and the property be sold . Cutting presented a plan to the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts to carry out the plan devised for the school in Poughkeepsie . In 1908 , school funds were donated to Cornell University as the Agricultural Student Loan Fund for students in Cornell 's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences . 
 From 1903 to 1905 the original school building was known as Pocantico Lodge , a small year @-@ round hotel . In 1905 Alice Knox , an employee at Mrs. Dow 's School , opened Miss Knox 's School in the building . Destroyed by fire in 1912 , the school moved to nearby Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown . The Knox School moved to St. James , on Long Island , in 1954 . The only remaining feature of the Poughkeepsie building is a stone retaining wall in front of the current building , built in 1925 by Oscar <unk> for Rufus P. Johnston ( pastor of John D. Rockefeller 's Fifth Avenue Baptist Church ) . The building , later occupied by Arthur O 'Connor , <unk> , and Frank B. Hall , is currently an unused part of Briarcliff Corporate Campus .

 Most of the Pine Plains farmland is occupied by Berkshire Stud , a Thoroughbred breeding farm which purchased 550 acres ( 220 ha ) beginning in 1983 , and the Mashomack Polo Club ( which owns the farmhouse on Halcyon Lake ) . The farm 's creamery and several barns ( some built during the 19th century ) still stand at the polo club , and have been used since the 1980s for stables , farm @-@ equipment storage and the raising of sporting birds . The barns also housed the Triangle Arts Association ( part of the Triangle Arts Trust ) from 1982 to 1993 .

 = The Simpsons : Hit & Run = 
 The Simpsons : Hit & Run is an action @-@ adventure video game based on the American animated sitcom The Simpsons , developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Vivendi Universal Games . It was released for the PlayStation 2 , Xbox , GameCube and Microsoft Windows on September 16 , 2003 . The game was an Xbox exclusive in Japan . The story and dialogue were crafted by writers from The Simpsons , with all character voices supplied by the actual cast . 
 The game follows the Simpson family , who witness many strange incidents that occur in Springfield : security cameras , mysterious vans , crop circles , and a " new and improved " flavor of the popular soft drink Buzz Cola ( which causes insanity ) . When the family takes matters into their own hands , along with the help of Apu , they discover numerous shocking secrets , and soon realize these incidents are part of a larger alien conspiracy . 
 The game received generally favorable reviews from video game critics . Praise focused on the interpretation of The Simpsons television series as a video game and its parodical take on Grand Theft Auto III , while criticism mostly surrounded some aspects of gameplay . The game received the award for Fave Video Game at the 2004 Nickelodeon Australian Kids ' Choice Awards . As of June 2007 , over three million copies of the game have been sold . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Hit & Run has seven levels , each with missions and sub @-@ plot . The player can only control one specific character in each level . The game 's playable characters are Homer , Bart , Lisa , Marge , and Apu . Homer and Bart are played as twice . When travelling by foot , the player character can walk , run , and perform three types of attacks : a normal kick , a jumping kick , and a smashing move . To drive , the player can either commandeer one of the vehicles that litter the road , a feature taken from Grand Theft Auto III , or use a phone booth to select a car . The game 's driving missions are also similar to those of Grand Theft Auto III . In both games , the player races against other characters , collects items before a timer runs out , and wrecks other cars . 
 The game has a sandbox @-@ style format that emphasizes driving , and the player controls their character from a third @-@ person view . The character can perform certain acts of violence , such as attacking pedestrians , blowing up vehicles , and destroying the environment . The Simpsons : Hit & Run has a warning meter that indicates when the police will retaliate for bad behaviour . Located in the bottom @-@ right corner of the screen , the circular " hit and run " meter fills up when the character runs people over or destroys objects , and decreases when they cease doing so . When full , several police cars chase the character for the duration of the hit and run . 
 Each level contains items the player can collect , such as coins , which can be gathered by either smashing Buzz Cola vending machines , Buzz Cola boxes or wasp cameras , the latter of which become more elusive as the game progresses . The coins can be used to buy new cars and outfits , some of which are required to progress through the game . The player can also collect Itchy and Scratchy cards . By collecting all 49 of them , seven in each level , the player unlocks a special The Itchy & Scratchy Show video . Several events can cause the player to lose coins ; because the character cannot die , injuries cause the player to lose coins . If the player is apprehended during a hit and run , they will be fined fifty coins . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Mysterious happenings are occurring in Springfield , including wasp @-@ shaped security cameras , mysterious black surveillance vans , crop circles , and a " new and improved " flavor of the popular soft drink Buzz Cola . A horde of these wasps descend upon the city at the beginning of the game . One enters the Simpsons ' home and is smashed by Homer , emitting coins . Homer picks up one of the coins , and watches a commercial for the new Buzz Cola on TV , hosted by Krusty the Clown , noticing the logo on the coin resembles that of Buzz Cola . Homer decides he must get Buzz Cola . 
 Homer at first goes to the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart and purchases Buzz Cola , then gets into more routine tasks , such as giving Lisa her science project or going to work . At the end of the day , Homer is sent home from work and watches a news report on TV , which informs him that the mysterious cameras and black vans are being spotted all across town . He notices one of the vans spying on him outside the house , and decides to pursue it , leading him to Mr. Burns ' mansion . Homer concludes that Mr. Burns is responsible , and goes to confront him . However , Burns reveals that the black vans were pizza delivery vans , and proceeds to fire and release his guard dogs on Homer . 
 The next day , Bart skips school in search of the new game , Bonestorm II . After evading Principal Skinner , he does tasks for certain people who give him a lead onto finding the game . The trail leads him to Professor Frink who , in turn for a few errands , lets Bart see the new <unk> . Bart is nearly attacked by it , but escapes before disappearing in a tractor beam . Lisa attempts to find her brother by exploring the Squidport for clues . She learns from Grampa that black sedans that have been appearing around town are connected to Bart 's disappearance , she also learns from Chief Wiggum that government @-@ style agents have been appearing across the Squidport area . Lisa destroys the sedans , but finds them to be empty . After completing a task for the Sea Captain , she destroys a black limo but discovers Bart got out of it and boarded a ship . She finds Bart on the ship ; he appears to have memory loss and is mumbling <unk> , while occasionally mentioning the sedans and Buzz Cola . 
 Marge sets out to learn what has affected Bart. As she investigates a crop circle that recently appeared in Cletus Spuckler 's crop field , Grampa tells her that the crop circle resembles the Buzz Cola logo . Marge gives a can of the cola to Bart , which snaps him out of his stupor . Bart reveals that the new Buzz Cola is an alien mind @-@ control , which he was given while abducted . Marge decides to purge Springfield of cola trucks , but in spite of her efforts , the drink still maintains its popularity . 
 Inspired by Marge 's efforts , Apu sets out to discover the source of the cola , remorseful for selling it in the first place . After some unsuccessful leads , he finally comes across Snake Jailbird , who tells him that the cola trucks are registered to the Springfield Museum of Natural History . Apu and Bart get to the museum , where they find a meteor as the source of the cola . They eavesdrop on a conversation between aliens Kang and Kodos , who are masterminding a scheme . Apu and Bart learn that the wasp cameras are filming the antics of Springfield for an intergalactic reality show , Foolish Earthlings . The aliens are using the cola to make people insane , by which time Kang and Kodos will distribute laser guns among the populace to drive the town to a violent massacre sure to draw many viewers . 
 Apu refuses to help any further , so Bart takes it upon himself to foil Kang and Kodos ' plan . He asks Krusty for help , but Krusty informs Bart that he has already helped the Duff Brewery set up free laser gun stands around Springfield . Bart then goes to his father , Homer , for help , and the duo quickly pursue Kang and Kodos to the brewery . However , the aliens escape , and before departing , they reveal that they have already released Buzz Cola throughout Springfield 's water supply . As the cola seeps into the ground , it releases the un @-@ dead from the Springfield Cemetery , who invade Springfield . 
 On Halloween , when Homer collects supplies to protect his family and home from the marauding zombies , he decides to pursue a black sports car — which is a probe for the aliens ' ship — to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant . There , he finds Professor Frink , who has discovered the aliens ' weakness : nuclear waste . He plans to use the alien ship 's tractor beam to suck up cars that are loaded with barrels of nuclear waste . After successfully loading Frink 's car , along with three more , into the aliens ' tractor beam , the ship explodes . The following day , Springfield is returned to normal , and Homer is seen as a celebrity among the viewers of Foolish Earthlings . 
 = = Development = = 
 The game 's developer , Radical Entertainment , received the rights to create games for The Simpsons franchise when they demonstrated a playable prototype . Radical released its first The Simpsons game in 2001 , called The Simpsons : Road Rage , a parody of the Crazy Taxi series of video games . After Road Rage was released , the development team for Hit & Run decided not to create a direct sequel to Road Rage ( although there are files in the game 's core that refers to it as " The Simpsons : Road Rage 2 " ) ; instead , Radical wanted to steer the franchise 's video game series in a different direction by giving the game engine a complete overhaul . The developers felt that everything else needed a new approach , while only the driving portion of Road Rage was worth keeping ; in Hit & Run , enhanced traffic artificial intelligence is introduced , which makes computer @-@ controlled vehicles react better to the player 's driving . The developers also decided to add an exploration element to the game to make players get out of the car and navigate the area on foot , so that the game offered a better experience of Springfield . 
 When developing the game 's graphics , the team decided to include landmarks from Springfield . The player is able to enter some of them , including the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart , Moe 's Tavern , Springfield Elementary School , and The Android 's Dungeon and Baseball Card Shop . During Hit & Run 's development , 20th Century Fox , Gracie Films and Matt Groening , the creator of The Simpsons , played important roles in bringing The Simpsons universe into a 3D environment . All character voices were supplied by the actual cast , and the series ' writers wrote the entire story for the game , including dialogue . Tim Ramage , the associate producer of the game 's publisher , Vivendi Universal Games , considered it a blessing to have the opportunity of working with The Simpsons cast , along with the writers , whom Ramage called " the best there is [ sic ] " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The game was released by Vivendi Universal for the Nintendo GameCube , Xbox , PlayStation 2 , and Windows in the United States on September 16 , 2003 and in Europe on October 31 , 2003 . Several reviews considered Hit & Run to be the best Simpsons game to date , and it was given generally favorable reviews , receiving an aggregated score of 81 % from Metacritic for its Xbox version . Praise focused on the move from the Simpsons television series to the video game format , while criticism targeted some aspects of gameplay . Hit & Run won the award for Fave Video Game at the 2004 Nickelodeon Kids ' Choice Awards . Over one million copies of the game were sold as of June 2004 , and three million as of June 2007 . 
 A number of reviews complimented the transposition of the Simpsons television series to a video game . Game Informer and GameSpot commented on how well the game depicted the fictional city of Springfield from the television series , and called it the most accurate representation of Springfield ever put into a game . Official Xbox Magazine said that the game did the show justice , and Play Magazine felt that it was " essentially the show in real time " , summing up its review by calling the game a " truly great cross @-@ over product " . GameSpot thought that the humor that the game offered included many excellent self @-@ referential jokes , and TeamXbox concluded its review by predicting that the game would be extremely appealing to gamers , especially hardcore Simpsons fans . Entertainment newspaper Variety surmised that Hit & Run was the first Simpsons game to include humor comparable to what was in the television series . 
 Hit & Run 's parodical take on the Grand Theft Auto III video game was praised by several reviewers . It was considered to " deftly satirize Grand Theft Auto while being almost as entertaining " in a review by GameSpy , which suggested that Hit & Run improved several gameplay aspects that it borrowed from Grand Theft Auto , including instant mission restarts , a superior guidance system , and an easily accessible collection of vehicles . Official Xbox Magazine agreed that Hit & Run was an excellent game in its own right , and found the game to be a " brilliant " clone of Grand Theft Auto . The combination of the Simpsons universe with the gameplay of the Grand Theft Auto series was also praised by IGN as " pure brilliance " . 
 Positive reviews of Hit & Run focused on its graphics and gameplay . Play Magazine appreciated the virtual world that the game offered , describing it as " grandiose in its expanse and artistic rendering " . GameSpot found the gameplay to be very engaging . The game was found to be " very fun and very funny " by Zach <unk> of GameSpy , and Game Informer called it " nothing short of astonishing " . Despite positive reactions , the game also had serious issues that were brought up in several reviews , which focused on the game 's bugs and glitches . Both TeamXbox and Game Revolution pointed out that Hit & Run had a few gameplay issues and graphical shortcomings that included strange artificial intelligence behaviour and a broken camera system , which they felt hindered the overall experience of the game . 
 = Nick Drake = 
 Nicholas Rodney " Nick " Drake ( 19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974 ) was an English singer @-@ songwriter and musician , known for his acoustic guitar @-@ based songs . He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime , but his work has posthumously achieved wider notice and recognition . Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20 years old and was a student at the University of Cambridge , and released his debut album , Five Leaves Left , in 1969 . By 1972 , he had recorded two more albums — Bryter Layter and Pink Moon . Neither sold more than 5 @,@ 000 copies on initial release . Drake 's reluctance to perform live , or be interviewed , contributed to his lack of commercial success . No footage of the adult Drake has ever been released ; only still photographs and home footage from his childhood . 
 Drake suffered from major depression , and this was often reflected in his lyrics . On completion of his third album , 1972 's Pink Moon , he withdrew from both live performance and recording , retreating to his parents ' home in rural Warwickshire . On 25 November 1974 , at the age of 26 , Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills , a prescribed antidepressant . His cause of death was determined to be suicide . 
 Drake 's music remained available through the mid @-@ 1970s , but the 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree allowed his back catalogue to be reassessed . By the mid @-@ 1980s Drake was being credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith , David Sylvian and Peter Buck . In 1985 , The Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with " Life in a Northern Town " , a song written for and dedicated to Drake . By the early 1990s , he had come to represent a certain type of " doomed romantic " musician in the UK music press . His first biography was published in 1997 , followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Nick 's father , Rodney Shuttleworth Drake ( 1908 – 1988 ) , had moved to Rangoon , Burma , in the early 1930s to work as an engineer with the Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation . There , in 1934 , his father met the daughter of a senior member of the Indian Civil Service , Mary Lloyd ( 1916 – 1993 ) , known to her family as " Molly " . Rodney Drake proposed to her in 1936 , though they had to wait a year until she turned 21 before her family allowed them to marry . In 1950 they returned to England to live in Warwickshire at a house named Far Leys , in the prosperous commuter village of Tanworth @-@ in @-@ Arden just south of Birmingham , the city where Rodney Drake worked from 1952 as the Chairman and Managing Director of Wolseley Engineering . Nick Drake had an older sister , Gabrielle , who became a successful film and television actress . Both parents were musically inclined and each wrote pieces of music . Recordings of Molly Drake 's songs , which have come to light since her death , are remarkably similar in tone and outlook to the later work of her son . Mother and son shared a similar fragile vocal delivery and both Gabrielle and biographer Trevor Dann have noted a parallel sense of foreboding and fatalism in their music . Encouraged by his mother , Drake learned to play piano at an early age and began to compose songs which he recorded on a reel @-@ to @-@ reel tape recorder she kept in the family drawing room . 
 In 1957 , Drake was sent to Eagle House School , a preparatory boarding school in Berkshire . Five years later , he went to Marlborough College , a public school in Wiltshire , attended by his father , grandfather , and great @-@ grandfather . He developed an interest in sport , becoming an accomplished sprinter over 100 and 200 yards , representing the school 's Open Team in 1966 . He played rugby for the C1 House team and was appointed a House Captain in his last two terms . School friends recall Drake at this time as having been confident and " quietly authoritative " , while often aloof in his manner . His father Rodney remembered , " In one of his reports [ the headmaster ] said that none of us seemed to know him very well . All the way through with Nick . People didn 't know him very much . " 
 Drake played piano in the school orchestra , and learned clarinet and saxophone . He formed a band , The Perfumed Gardeners , with four schoolmates in 1964 or 1965 . With Drake on piano and occasional alto sax and vocals , the group performed Pye International R & B covers and jazz standards , as well as Yardbirds and Manfred Mann numbers . Chris de Burgh asked to join the band , but was rejected as his taste was seen as " too poppy " by the other members . Drake 's academic performance began to deteriorate , and while he had accelerated a year in Eagle House , at Marlborough he began to neglect his studies in favour of music . In 1963 he attained seven GCE O @-@ Levels , fewer than his teachers had been expecting , failing " Physics with Chemistry " , a fall @-@ back for students who struggled with science . In 1965 , Drake paid £ 13 for his first acoustic guitar , and was soon experimenting with open tuning and finger @-@ picking techniques . 
 In 1966 Drake enrolled at a tutorial college in Five Ways , Birmingham , from where he won a scholarship to study English literature at Fitzwilliam College , University of Cambridge . He delayed attendance to spend six months at the University of Aix @-@ Marseille , France , beginning in February 1967 . While in Aix , he began to practice guitar in earnest , and to earn money would often busk with friends in the town centre . Drake began to smoke cannabis , and that spring he travelled with friends to Morocco , because , according to travelling companion Richard <unk> , " that was where you got the best pot " . Drake most likely began using LSD while in Aix , and lyrics written during this period — in particular for the song " Clothes of Sand " — are suggestive of an interest in hallucinogens . 
 = = Cambridge = = 
 On returning to England , Drake moved into his sister 's flat in Hampstead , London , before enrolling at Cambridge University that October to study English Literature . His tutors found him to be a bright student , but unenthusiastic and unwilling to apply himself . He did not perform well at Cambridge and was awarded a third , the lowest honours @-@ pass . Dann notes that he had difficulty connecting with staff and fellow students alike , and points out that official matriculation photographs from this time reveal a sullen and <unk> young man . Cambridge placed much emphasis on its rugby and cricket teams , yet by this time Drake had lost interest in playing sport , preferring to stay in his college room smoking cannabis , and listening to and playing music . According to fellow student ( now psychiatrist ) Brian Wells : " they were the rugger buggers and we were the cool people smoking dope . " In September 1967 , he met Robert Kirby , a music student who went on to orchestrate many of the string and woodwind arrangements for Drake 's first two albums . By this time , Drake had discovered the British and American folk music scenes , and was influenced by performers such as Bob Dylan , Josh White and Phil Ochs . He began performing in local clubs and coffee houses around London , and in February 1968 , while playing support to Country Joe and the Fish at the Roundhouse in Camden Town , made an impression on Ashley Hutchings , bass player with Fairport Convention . Hutchings recalls being impressed by Drake 's skill as a guitarist , but even more so by " the image . He looked like a star . He looked wonderful , he seemed to be 7 ft [ tall ] . " 
 Hutchings introduced Drake to the 25 @-@ year @-@ old American producer Joe Boyd , owner of the production and management company Witchseason Productions . The company was , at the time , licensed to Island Records , and Boyd , the man who had discovered Fairport Convention and been responsible for introducing John Martyn and The Incredible String Band to a mainstream audience , was a significant and respected figure on the UK folk scene . He and Drake formed an immediate bond , and the producer acted as a mentor to Drake throughout his career . A four @-@ track demo , recorded in Drake 's college room in the spring of 1968 , led Boyd to offer a management , publishing , and production contract to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , and to initiate work on a debut album . According to Boyd : 
 In those days you didn 't have cassettes — he brought a reel @-@ to @-@ reel tape [ to me ] that he 'd done at home . Half way through the first song , I felt this was pretty special . And I called him up , and he came back in , and we talked , and I just said , " I 'd like to make a record . " He stammered , " Oh , well , yeah . Okay . " Nick was a man of few words . 
 In a 2004 interview , Drake 's friend Paul Wheeler remembered the excitement caused by his seeming big break , and recalled that the singer had already decided not to complete his third year at Cambridge .

 = = = Five Leaves Left = = = 
 Drake began recording his debut album Five Leaves Left later in 1968 , with Boyd assuming the role of producer . The sessions took place in Sound Techniques studio , London , with Drake skipping lectures to travel by train to the capital . Inspired by John Simon 's production of Leonard Cohen 's first album , Boyd was keen that Drake 's voice would be recorded in a similar close and intimate style , " with no shiny pop reverb " . He sought to include a string arrangement similar to Simon 's , " without overwhelming ... or sounding cheesy " . To provide backing , Boyd enlisted various contacts from the London folk rock scene , including Fairport Convention guitarist Richard Thompson and Pentangle bassist Danny Thompson ( no relation ) . He recruited John Wood as engineer , and drafted in Richard Hewson to provide the string arrangements . 
 Initial recordings did not go well : the sessions were irregular and rushed , taking place during studio downtime borrowed from Fairport Convention 's production of their Unhalfbricking album . Tension arose between artist and producer as to the direction the album should take : Boyd was an advocate of George Martin 's " using the studio as an instrument " approach , while Drake preferred a more organic sound . Dann has observed that Drake appears " tight and anxious " on bootleg recordings taken from the sessions , and notes a number of Boyd 's unsuccessful attempts at instrumentation . Both were unhappy with Hewson 's contribution , which they felt was too mainstream in sound for Drake 's songs . Drake suggested using his college friend Robert Kirby as a replacement . Though Boyd was skeptical about taking on an amateur music student lacking prior recording experience , he was impressed by Drake 's uncharacteristic assertiveness , and agreed to a trial . Kirby had previously presented Drake with some arrangements for his songs . However , Kirby did not feel confident enough to score the album 's centerpiece " River Man " , and Boyd was forced to stretch the Witchseason budget to hire the veteran composer Harry Robertson , with the instruction that he echo the tone of Delius and Ravel . 
 Post @-@ production difficulties led to the release being delayed by several months . It has been alleged that the album was poorly marketed and supported , though the inclusion of the opening track " Time Has Told Me " on the Island Records sampler Nice Enough to Eat brought him a very wide audience ( a track from his second album was likewise included on the subsequent sampler Bumpers ) . Drake was featured in full @-@ page interviews in the pop press . In July , Melody Maker referred to the album as " poetic " and " interesting " , though NME wrote in October that there was " not nearly enough variety to make it entertaining " . It received radio plays from the BBC 's more progressive disc @-@ jockeys such as John Peel and Bob Harris . Drake was unhappy with the inlay sleeve , which printed songs in the wrong running order and reproduced verses omitted from the recorded versions . In an interview his sister Gabrielle said : " He was very secretive . I knew he was making an album but I didn 't know what stage of completion it was at until he walked into my room and said , ' There you are . ' He threw it onto the bed and walked out ! " 
 = = = Bryter Layter = = = 
 Drake ended his studies at Cambridge nine months before graduation , and in autumn 1969 moved to London . His father remembered " writing him long letters , pointing out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge ... a degree was a safety net , if you manage to get a degree , at least you have something to fall back on ; his reply to that was that a safety net was the one thing he did not want . " Drake spent his first few months in the capital drifting from place to place , occasionally staying at his sister 's Kensington flat , but usually sleeping on friends ’ sofas and floors . Eventually , in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake 's life , Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park , Camden . 
 In August 1969 Drake recorded five songs , only three of which ( " Cello Song " , " Three Hours " , and " Time of No Reply " ) were broadcast – for the BBC 's John Peel show . Two months later , he opened for Fairport Convention at the Royal Festival Hall in London , followed by appearances at folk clubs in Birmingham and Hull . Remembering the performance in Hull , folk singer Michael Chapman commented : 
 The <unk> did not take to him ; [ they ] wanted songs with choruses . They completely missed the point . He didn 't say a word the entire evening . It was actually quite painful to watch . I don 't know what the audience expected , I mean , they must have known they weren 't going to get sea @-@ shanties and sing @-@ alongs at a Nick Drake gig ! 
 The experience reinforced Drake 's decision to retreat from live appearances ; the few concerts he did play around this time were usually brief , awkward , and poorly attended . Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience . As many of his songs were played in different tunings , he frequently paused to retune between numbers . 
 Although the publicity generated by Five Leaves Left was minor , Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was . 1971 's Bryter Layter , again produced by Boyd and engineered by Wood , introduced a more upbeat , jazzier sound . Disappointed by his debut 's poor commercial performance , Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound , and agreed to his producer 's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks on the recordings . " It was more of a pop sound , I suppose , " Boyd later said . " I imagined it as more commercial . " Like its predecessor , the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention , as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs : " Northern Sky " and " Fly " . Trevor Dann has noted that while sections of " Northern Sky " sound more characteristic of Cale , the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential . In his 1999 autobiography , Cale admits to using heroin during this period , and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using . Both Boyd and Wood were confident that the album would be a commercial success , but it sold fewer than 3 @,@ 000 copies . Reviews were again mixed : while Record Mirror praised Drake as a " beautiful guitarist — clean and with perfect timing , [ and ] accompanied by soft , beautiful arrangements " , Melody Maker described the album as " an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz " . 
 Soon after its release , Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records , and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers in the development of soundtracks for film . The loss of his key mentor , coupled with the album 's poor sales , led Drake to further retreat into depression . His attitude to London had changed : he was unhappy living alone , and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970 . In June , Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College , Surrey . Ralph McTell , who also performed that night , remembered that " Nick was monosyllabic . At that particular gig he was very shy . He did the first set and something awful must have happened . He was doing his song ' Fruit Tree ' and walked off halfway through it . Just left the stage . " His frustration turned to depression , and in 1971 Drake was persuaded by his family to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas 's Hospital , London . He was prescribed a course of antidepressants , but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them , and tried to hide the fact from his friends . He knew enough about drugs to worry about their side effects , and was concerned about how they would react with his regular cannabis use . 
 = = = Pink Moon = = = 
 Island Records was keen on Drake promoting Bryter Layter through press interviews , radio sessions and live appearances . Drake , who by this time was smoking what Kirby has described as " unbelievable amounts " of cannabis and exhibiting " the first signs of psychosis " , refused . Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter , he turned his thoughts inwards , and withdrew from family and friends . He rarely left his flat , and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs . His sister recalled : " This was a very bad time . He once said to me that everything started to go wrong from [ this ] time on , and I think that was when things started to go wrong . " 
 Although Island neither expected nor wanted a third album , Drake approached Wood in October 1971 to begin work on what would be his final release . Sessions took place over two nights , with only Drake and Wood present in the studio . The bleak songs of Pink Moon are short , and the eleven @-@ track album lasts only 28 minutes , a length described by Wood as " just about right . You really wouldn 't want it to be any longer . " Drake had expressed dissatisfaction with the sound of Bryter Layter , and believed that the string , brass and saxophone arrangements had resulted in a sound that was " too full , too elaborate " . Drake appears on Pink Moon accompanied only by his own carefully recorded guitar save for a single piano overdub on the title track . Wood later said : " He was very determined to make this very stark , bare record . He definitely wanted it to be him more than anything . And I think , in some ways , Pink Moon is probably more like Nick is than the other two records . " 
 Drake delivered the tapes of Pink Moon to Chris Blackwell at Island Records , contrary to a popular legend which claims he dropped them off at the receptionist 's desk without saying a word . An advertisement for the album in Melody Maker in February opened with " Pink Moon — Nick Drake 's latest album : the first we heard of it was when it was finished . " Pink Moon sold fewer copies than either of its predecessors , although it received some favourable reviews . In Zigzag magazine , Connor McKnight wrote , " Nick Drake is an artist who never fakes . The album makes no concession to the theory that music should be escapist . It 's simply one musician 's view of life at the time , and you can 't ask for more than that . " 
 Blackwell felt Pink Moon had the potential to bring Drake to a mainstream audience ; however , his staff were disappointed by the artist 's unwillingness to undertake any promotional activity . A & R manager Muff Winwood recalls " tearing his hair out " in frustration , and admits that without Blackwell 's enthusiastic support , " the rest of us would have given him the boot . " Following persistent nagging from Boyd , Drake agreed to an interview with Jerry Gilbert of Sounds Magazine . The " shy and introverted folk singer " spoke of his dislike of live appearances and very little else . " There wasn 't any connection whatsoever " , Gilbert has said . " I don 't think he made eye contact with me once . " Disheartened and convinced he would be unable to write again , Drake decided to retire from music . He toyed with the idea of a different career , even considering the army . 
 = = Final years = = 
 In the months following Pink Moon 's release , Drake became increasingly asocial and distant from those close to him . He returned to live at his parents ' home in Tanworth @-@ in @-@ Arden , and while he resented the regression , he accepted that his illness made it necessary . " I don 't like it at home , " he told his mother , " but I can 't bear it anywhere else . " His return was often difficult for his family ; as his sister Gabrielle explained , " good days in my parents ' home were good days for Nick , and bad days were bad days for Nick . And that was what their life revolved around , really . " 
 He lived a frugal existence , his only source of income being a £ 20 @-@ a @-@ week retainer he received from Island Records . At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes . He would often disappear for days , sometimes turning up unannounced at friends ' houses , uncommunicative and withdrawn . Robert Kirby described a typical visit : " He would arrive and not talk , sit down , listen to music , have a smoke , have a drink , sleep there the night , and two or three days later he wasn 't there , he 'd be gone . And three months later he 'd be back . " Nick 's supervision partner at Cambridge , John Venning , once saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously clinically depressed . " There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all . So I turned around . " 
 Referring to this period , John Martyn ( who in 1973 wrote the title song of his album Solid Air for and about Drake ) described him as the most withdrawn person he had ever met . He would borrow his mother 's car and drive for hours without purpose on occasion , until he ran out of petrol and had to ring his parents to ask to be collected . Friends have recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed . During particularly bleak periods of his illness , he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails . Early in 1972 , Drake had a nervous breakdown , and was hospitalized for five weeks . 
 In February 1974 , Drake contacted John Wood , stating he was ready to begin work on a fourth album . Boyd was in England at the time , and agreed to attend the recordings . The initial session was followed by further recordings in July . In his 2006 autobiography , the producer recalled being taken aback at Drake 's anger and bitterness : " [ He said that ] I had told him he was a genius , and others had concurred . Why wasn 't he famous and rich ? This rage must have festered beneath that inexpressive exterior for years . " Both Boyd and Wood noticed a discernible deterioration in Drake 's performance , requiring him to overdub his voice separately over the guitar . However , the return to Sound Techniques ' studio raised Drake 's spirits ; his mother later recalled , " We were so absolutely thrilled to think that Nick was happy because there hadn 't been any happiness in Nick 's life for years . "

 By autumn 1974 , Drake 's weekly retainer from Island had ceased , and his illness meant he remained in contact with only a few close friends . He had tried to stay in touch with Sophia Ryde , whom he had first met in London in 1968 . Ryde has been described by Drake 's biographers as " the nearest thing " to a girlfriend in his life , but she now prefers the description " best ( girl ) friend " . In a 2005 interview , Ryde revealed that a week before he died , she had sought to end the relationship : " I couldn 't cope with it . I asked him for some time . And I never saw him again . " As with the relationship he had earlier shared with fellow folk musician Linda Thompson , Drake 's relationship with Ryde was never consummated . 
 At some time during the night of 24 / 25 November 1974 , Nick Drake died at home in Far Leys , Tanworth @-@ in @-@ Arden , from an overdose of amitriptyline , a type of antidepressant . He had gone to bed early after spending the afternoon visiting a friend . His mother said that around dawn he left his room for the kitchen . His family was used to hearing him do this many times before but , during this instance , he did not make a sound . They presumed he was eating a bowl of cereal . He returned to his room a short while later , and took some pills " to help him sleep " . Drake was accustomed to keeping his own hours ; he frequently had difficulty sleeping and often stayed up through the night playing and listening to music , then slept late into the following morning . Recalling the events of the night , his mother later said : " I never used to disturb him at all . But it was about 12 o 'clock , and I went in , because really it seemed it was time he got up . And he was lying across the bed . The first thing I saw was his long , long legs . " There was no suicide note , although a letter addressed to Ryde was found close to his bed . 
 At the inquest in December , the coroner stated that the cause of death was as a result of " Acute amitriptyline poisoning — self @-@ administered when suffering from a depressive illness " , and concluded a verdict of suicide . Although the verdict has been disputed by some members of his family , there is a wide view that , accidental or not , Drake had by then " given up on life . " Rodney described his son 's death as unexpected and extraordinary ; however , in a 1979 interview he admitted to " always [ being ] worried about Nick being so depressed . We used to hide away the aspirin and pills and things like that . " Boyd has said that he prefers to believe the overdose was accidental . He recalled that Drake 's parents had described his mood in the preceding weeks as having been very positive , and that he had planned to move back to London to restart his music career . Boyd believes that this uplift in spirits was followed by a " crash back into despair " . Reasoning that Drake may have taken a high dosage of antidepressants to recapture this sense of optimism , he said he prefers to imagine Drake " making a desperate lunge for life rather than a calculated surrender to death " . Writing in 1975 , NME journalist Nick Kent comments on the irony of Drake 's death at a time when he had just begun to regain a sense of " personal balance " . In contrast , Gabrielle Drake has said she prefers to think her brother committed suicide , " in the sense that I 'd rather he died because he wanted to end it than it to be the result of a tragic mistake . That would seem to me to be terrible . " 
 On 2 December 1974 , after a service in the Church of St Mary Magdalene , Tanworth @-@ in @-@ Arden , Drake 's remains were cremated at Solihull Crematorium and his ashes later interred under an oak tree in the graveyard of St Mary 's . The funeral was attended by around fifty mourners , including friends from Marlborough , Aix , Cambridge , London , Witchseason , and Tanworth . Referring to Drake 's tendency to compartmentalise relationships , Brian Wells observed that many met each other for the first time that morning . His mother Molly recalled " a lot of his young friends came up here . We 'd never met many of them . " 
 = = Posthumous popularity = = 
 There were no documentaries or compilation albums in the wake of Drake 's death . His public profile remained low throughout the mid and late 1970s , although occasional mentions of his name appeared in the music press . By this time , his parents were receiving an increasing number of fans and admirers as visitors to the family home in Far Leys . Island Records , following a 1975 NME article written by Nick Kent , stated " we have no intention of repackaging Nick 's three albums ( which remained available ) , either now or at anytime in the foreseeable future " , but in 1979 Rob Partridge joined Island Records as press officer and commissioned the release of the Fruit Tree box set . Partridge was a fan of Drake 's , and had seen him perform early in 1969 : " The first thing I did when I got to Island was suggest we put together a retrospective — the studio albums plus whatever else was there . I wasn 't necessarily expecting massive vaults with millions of tunes , live recordings or whatever , but there was very little " . The release brought together the three studio albums as well as the four tracks recorded with Wood in 1974 and was accompanied by an extensive biography written by the American journalist Arthur Lubow . Although sales were poor , Island Records never deleted the three albums from its catalogue . 
 By the mid @-@ 1980s Drake was being cited as an influence by musicians such as R.E.M. ' s Peter Buck and Robert Smith of The Cure ; Smith credited the origin of his band 's name to a lyric from Drake 's song " Time Has Told Me " ( " a troubled cure for a troubled mind " ) . Drake gained further exposure in 1985 with the release of The Dream Academy 's hit single " Life in a Northern Town " , which included an on @-@ sleeve dedication to Drake . In 1986 the first biography of Drake was published , in Danish — it was eventually translated , updated with new interviews , and published in English in February 2012 . His reputation continued to grow , and by the end of the 1980s , his name was appearing regularly in newspapers and music magazines in the United Kingdom ; he had to many come to represent a " doomed romantic hero " . The first step in translating that reputation into record sales came with the release of the compilation album Way to Blue : An Introduction to Nick Drake in May 1994 . 
 Nick Drake 's first of many inclusions on film soundtracks came in 1995 when Noah Baumbach included " Time of No Reply " in his independent film Kicking and Screaming . 
 On 20 June 1998 , BBC Radio 2 broadcast a documentary entitled Fruit Tree : The Nick Drake Story , featuring interviews with Joe Boyd , John Wood , Gabrielle and Molly Drake , Paul Wheeler , Robert Kirby and Ashley Hutchings , and narrated by Danny Thompson . In early 1999 , BBC2 aired a 40 @-@ minute documentary , A Stranger Among Us — In Search of Nick Drake . The following year , Dutch director Jeroen <unk> released the documentary A Skin Too Few : The Days of Nick Drake , featuring interviews with Boyd , Gabrielle Drake , Wood and Kirby . Later that year , The Guardian placed Bryter Layter at number 1 in its " Alternative Top 100 Albums Ever " list . In 2001 , American independent film director Allison Anders took the title of her harrowing autobiographical film Things Behind the Sun from the song on Drake 's Pink Moon album . The song was included in the soundtrack of the film . In November 2014 a biography of Drake was published by his sister Gabrielle . 
 To tie in with the release of the compilation album Made to Love Magic , an updated version of the documentary was broadcast on 22 May 2004 on Radio 2 , retitled Lost Boy : In Search of Nick Drake and featuring the same interview clips but with Thompson 's narration replaced by that of Brad Pitt , a self @-@ confessed Nick Drake fan . Two Nick Drake singles , " Magic " and " River Man " , which were released to coincide with the Made to Love Magic album , made the charts , a first for the artist 's work some thirty years after his death . 
 On 25 November 2014 , the 40th anniversary of Drake 's passing , journalist Alan Connor , writing for BBC 's Magazine Monitor , reviewed the biography Remembered for a While and argued that the " melancholy legend " does Drake 's music " a disservice " . 
 = = Musical and lyrical style = = 
 Drake was obsessive about practising his guitar technique , and would often stay up through the night experimenting with tunings and working on songs . His mother remembered hearing him " bumping around at all hours . I think he wrote his nicest melodies in the early @-@ morning hours . " Self @-@ taught , he achieved his guitar style through the use of alternative tunings to create cluster chords . These are difficult to achieve on a guitar using standard tuning ; Drake used tunings which made cluster chords available using more conventional chord shapes . In many songs he accents the dissonant effect of such non @-@ standard tunings through his vocal melodies . 
 Drake , who studied English literature at Cambridge , was particularly drawn to the works of William Blake , William Butler Yeats and Henry Vaughan , and his lyrics reflect such influences . Drake also employs a series of elemental symbols and codes , largely drawn from nature . The moon , stars , sea , rain , trees , sky , mist and seasons are all commonly used , influenced in part by his rural upbringing . Images related to summer figure centrally in his early work ; from Bryter Layter on , his language is more autumnal , evoking a season commonly used to convey senses of loss and sorrow . Throughout , Drake writes with detachment , more as an observer than participant , a point of view Rolling Stone 's Anthony DeCurtis described " as if he were viewing his life from a great , unbridgeable distance . " 
 This perceived inability to connect has led to much speculation about Drake 's sexuality . Boyd has said he detects a virginal quality in his lyrics and music , and notes that he never observed or heard of the singer behaving in a sexual way with anyone , male or female . Kirby described Drake 's lyrics as a " series of extremely vivid , complete observations , almost like a series of epigrammatic proverbs " , though he doubts that Drake saw himself as " any sort of poet " . Instead , Kirby believes that Drake 's lyrics were crafted to " complement and compound a mood that the melody dictates in the first place . "

 = Group ( mathematics ) = 
 In mathematics , a group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set of elements equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element . The operation satisfies four conditions called the group axioms , namely closure , associativity , identity and <unk> . One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of integers together with the addition operation , but the abstract formalization of the group axioms , detached as it is from the concrete nature of any particular group and its operation , applies much more widely . It allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins in abstract algebra and beyond to be handled in a flexible way while retaining their essential structural aspects . The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics . 
 Groups share a fundamental kinship with the notion of symmetry . For example , a symmetry group encodes symmetry features of a geometrical object : the group consists of the set of transformations that leave the object unchanged and the operation of combining two such transformations by performing one after the other . Lie groups are the symmetry groups used in the Standard Model of particle physics ; Poincaré groups , which are also Lie groups , can express the physical symmetry underlying special relativity ; and Point groups are used to help understand symmetry phenomena in molecular chemistry . 
 The concept of a group arose from the study of polynomial equations , starting with Évariste Galois in the 1830s . After contributions from other fields such as number theory and geometry , the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870 . Modern group theory — an active mathematical discipline — studies groups in their own right . To explore groups , mathematicians have devised various notions to break groups into smaller , better @-@ understandable pieces , such as subgroups , quotient groups and simple groups . In addition to their abstract properties , group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely ( its group representations ) , both from a theoretical and a computational point of view . A theory has been developed for finite groups , which culminated with the classification of finite simple groups , completed in 2004 . Since the mid @-@ 1980s , geometric group theory , which studies finitely generated groups as geometric objects , has become a particularly active area in group theory . 
 = = Definition and illustration = = 
 = = = First example : the integers = = = 
 One of the most familiar groups is the set of integers Z which consists of the numbers 
 ... , − 4 , − 3 , − 2 , − 1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... , together with addition . 
 The following properties of integer addition serve as a model for the abstract group axioms given in the definition below . 
 For any two integers a and b , the sum a + b is also an integer . That is , addition of integers always yields an integer . This property is known as closure under addition . 
 For all integers a , b and c , ( a + b ) + c 
 = a + ( b + c ) . Expressed in words , adding a to b first , and then adding the result to c gives the same final result as adding a to the sum of b and c , a property known as associativity . 
 If a is any integer , then 0 + a = 
 a + 0 
 = a . Zero is called the identity element of addition because adding it to any integer returns the same integer . 
 For every integer a , there is an integer b such that a + b = 
 b + a = 0 . The integer b is called the inverse element of the integer a and is denoted − a . 
 The integers , together with the operation + , form a mathematical object belonging to a broad class sharing similar structural aspects . To appropriately understand these structures as a collective , the following abstract definition is developed . 
 = = = Definition = = = 
 A group is a set , G , together with an operation • ( called the group law of G ) that combines any two elements a and b to form another element , denoted a • b or ab . To qualify as a group , the set and operation , ( G , • ) , must satisfy four requirements known as the group axioms : 
 Closure 
 For all a , b in G , the result of the operation , a • b , is also in G. 
 Associativity 
 For all a , b and c in G , ( a • b ) • c 
 = a • ( b • c ) . 
 Identity element 
 There exists an element e in G , such that for every element a in G , the equation e • a = 
 a • e 
 = a holds . Such an element is unique ( see below ) , and thus one speaks of the identity element . 
 Inverse element 
 For each a in G , there exists an element b in G , commonly denoted a − 1 ( or − a , if the operation is denoted " + " ) , such that a • b = 
 b • a 
 = e , where e is the identity element . 
 The result of an operation may depend on the order of the operands . In other words , the result of combining element a with element b need not yield the same result as combining element b with element a ; the equation 
 a • b = 
 b • a 
 may not always be true . This equation always holds in the group of integers under addition , because a + b 
 = b + a for any two integers ( commutativity of addition ) . Groups for which the commutativity equation a • b = 
 b • a always holds are called abelian groups ( in honor of Niels Henrik Abel ) . The symmetry group described in the following section is an example of a group that is not abelian . 
 The identity element of a group G is often written as 1 or 1G , a notation inherited from the multiplicative identity . If a group is abelian , then one may choose to denote the group operation by + and the identity element by 0 ; in that case , the group is called an additive group . The identity element can also be written as id . 
 The set G is called the underlying set of the group ( G , • ) . Often the group 's underlying set G is used as a short name for the group ( G , • ) . Along the same lines , shorthand expressions such as " a subset of the group G " or " an element of group G " are used when what is actually meant is " a subset of the underlying set G of the group ( G , • ) " or " an element of the underlying set G of the group ( G , • ) " . Usually , it is clear from the context whether a symbol like G refers to a group or to an underlying set . 
 = = = Second example : a symmetry group = = = 
 Two figures in the plane are congruent if one can be changed into the other using a combination of rotations , reflections , and translations . Any figure is congruent to itself . However , some figures are congruent to themselves in more than one way , and these extra congruences are called symmetries . A square has eight symmetries . These are : 
 the identity operation leaving everything unchanged , denoted id ; 
 rotations of the square around its center by 90 ° clockwise , 180 ° clockwise , and 270 ° clockwise , denoted by r1 , r2 and r3 , respectively ; 
 reflections about the vertical and horizontal middle line ( fh and fv ) , or through the two diagonals ( fd and fc ) . 
 These symmetries are represented by functions . Each of these functions sends a point in the square to the corresponding point under the symmetry . For example , r1 sends a point to its rotation 90 ° clockwise around the square 's center , and fh sends a point to its reflection across the square 's vertical middle line . Composing two of these symmetry functions gives another symmetry function . These symmetries determine a group called the dihedral group of degree 4 and denoted D4 . The underlying set of the group is the above set of symmetry functions , and the group operation is function composition . Two symmetries are combined by composing them as functions , that is , applying the first one to the square , and the second one to the result of the first application . The result of performing first a and then b is written symbolically from right to left as 
 b • a ( " apply the symmetry b after performing the symmetry a " ) . 
 The right @-@ to @-@ left notation is the same notation that is used for composition of functions . 
 The group table on the right lists the results of all such compositions possible . For example , rotating by 270 ° clockwise ( r3 ) and then reflecting horizontally ( fh ) is the same as performing a reflection along the diagonal ( fd ) . Using the above symbols , highlighted in blue in the group table : 
 fh • r3 
 = fd . 
 Given this set of symmetries and the described operation , the group axioms can be understood as follows : 
 In contrast to the group of integers above , where the order of the operation is irrelevant , it does matter in D4 : fh • r1 = 
 fc but r1 • fh = fd . In other words , D4 is not abelian , which makes the group structure more difficult than the integers introduced first . 
 = = History = = 
 The modern concept of an abstract group developed out of several fields of mathematics . The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of polynomial equations of degree higher than 4 . The 19th @-@ century French mathematician Évariste Galois , extending prior work of Paolo <unk> and Joseph @-@ Louis Lagrange , gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the symmetry group of its roots ( solutions ) . The elements of such a Galois group correspond to certain permutations of the roots . At first , Galois ' ideas were rejected by his contemporaries , and published only posthumously . More general permutation groups were investigated in particular by Augustin Louis Cauchy . Arthur Cayley 's On the theory of groups , as depending on the symbolic equation <unk> = 1 ( 1854 ) gives the first abstract definition of a finite group . 
 Geometry was a second field in which groups were used systematically , especially symmetry groups as part of Felix Klein 's 1872 Erlangen program . After novel geometries such as hyperbolic and projective geometry had emerged , Klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way . Further advancing these ideas , Sophus Lie founded the study of Lie groups in 1884 . 
 The third field contributing to group theory was number theory . Certain abelian group structures had been used implicitly in Carl Friedrich Gauss ' number @-@ theoretical work <unk> <unk> ( 1798 ) , and more explicitly by Leopold Kronecker . In 1847 , Ernst Kummer made early attempts to prove Fermat 's Last Theorem by developing groups describing factorization into prime numbers . 
 The convergence of these various sources into a uniform theory of groups started with Camille Jordan 's Traité des substitutions et des équations <unk> ( 1870 ) . Walther von Dyck ( 1882 ) introduced the idea of specifying a group by means of generators and relations , and was also the first to give an axiomatic definition of an " abstract group " , in the terminology of the time . As of the 20th century , groups gained wide recognition by the pioneering work of Ferdinand Georg Frobenius and William Burnside , who worked on representation theory of finite groups , Richard Brauer 's modular representation theory and <unk> Schur 's papers . The theory of Lie groups , and more generally locally compact groups was studied by Hermann Weyl , Élie Cartan and many others . Its algebraic counterpart , the theory of algebraic groups , was first shaped by Claude <unk> ( from the late 1930s ) and later by the work of Armand Borel and Jacques Tits . 
 The University of Chicago 's 1960 – 61 Group Theory Year brought together group theorists such as Daniel <unk> , John G. Thompson and Walter <unk> , laying the foundation of a collaboration that , with input from numerous other mathematicians , led to the classification of finite simple groups , with the final step taken by <unk> and Smith in 2004 . This project exceeded previous mathematical endeavours by its sheer size , in both length of proof and number of researchers . Research is ongoing to simplify the proof of this classification . These days , group theory is still a highly active mathematical branch , impacting many other fields . 
 = = Elementary consequences of the group axioms = = 
 Basic facts about all groups that can be obtained directly from the group axioms are commonly subsumed under elementary group theory . For example , repeated applications of the associativity axiom show that the <unk> of 
 a • b • c 
 = ( a • b ) • c = 
 a • ( b • c ) 
 generalizes to more than three factors . Because this implies that parentheses can be inserted anywhere within such a series of terms , parentheses are usually omitted . 
 The axioms may be weakened to assert only the existence of a left identity and left inverses . Both can be shown to be actually two @-@ sided , so the resulting definition is equivalent to the one given above . 
 = = = Uniqueness of identity element and inverses = = = 
 Two important consequences of the group axioms are the uniqueness of the identity element and the uniqueness of inverse elements . There can be only one identity element in a group , and each element in a group has exactly one inverse element . Thus , it is customary to speak of the identity , and the inverse of an element . 
 To prove the uniqueness of an inverse element of a , suppose that a has two inverses , denoted b and c , in a group ( G , • ) . Then 
 The term b on the first line above and the c on the last are equal , since they are connected by a chain of equalities . In other words , there is only one inverse element of a . Similarly , to prove that the identity element of a group is unique , assume G is a group with two identity elements e and f . Then e 
 = e • f = 
 f , hence e and f are equal . 
 = = = Division = = = 
 In groups , the <unk> of the group action means that division is possible : given elements a and b of the group G , there is exactly one solution x in G to the equation x • a 
 = b . In fact , right multiplication of the equation by a − 1 gives the solution x = 
 x • a • a − 1 
 = b • a − 1 . Similarly there is exactly one solution y in G to the equation a • y = 
 b , namely y 
 = a − 1 • b . If the • operation is commutative , we get that x = 
 y . If not , x may be different from y . 
 A consequence of this is that multiplying by a group element g is a bijection . Specifically , if g is an element of the group G , there is a bijection from G to itself called left translation by g sending h ∈ G to g • h . Similarly , right translation by g is a bijection from G to itself sending h to h • g . If G is abelian , left and right translation by a group element are the same . 
 = = Basic concepts = = 
 To understand groups beyond the level of mere symbolic manipulations as above , more structural concepts have to be employed . There is a conceptual principle underlying all of the following notions : to take advantage of the structure offered by groups ( which sets , being " structureless " , do not have ) , constructions related to groups have to be compatible with the group operation . This compatibility manifests itself in the following notions in various ways . For example , groups can be related to each other via functions called group homomorphisms . By the mentioned principle , they are required to respect the group structures in a precise sense . The structure of groups can also be understood by breaking them into pieces called subgroups and quotient groups . The principle of " preserving structures " — a recurring topic in mathematics throughout — is an instance of working in a category , in this case the category of groups . 
 = = = Group homomorphisms = = = 
 Group homomorphisms are functions that preserve group structure . A function a : G → H between two groups ( G , • ) and ( H , ∗ ) is called a homomorphism if the equation 
 a ( g • k ) 
 = a ( g ) ∗ a ( k ) 
 holds for all elements g , k in G. In other words , the result is the same when performing the group operation after or before applying the map a . This requirement ensures that a ( 1G ) = 
 1H , and also a ( g ) − 1 
 = a ( g − 1 ) for all g in G. Thus a group homomorphism respects all the structure of G provided by the group axioms . 
 Two groups G and H are called isomorphic if there exist group homomorphisms a : G → H and b : H → G , such that applying the two functions one after another in each of the two possible orders gives the identity functions of G and H. That is , a ( b ( h ) ) = 
 h and b ( a ( g ) ) 
 = g for any g in G and h in H. From an abstract point of view , isomorphic groups carry the same information . For example , proving that g • g = 
 1G for some element g of G is equivalent to proving that a ( g ) ∗ a ( g ) = 1H , because applying a to the first equality yields the second , and applying b to the second gives back the first . 
 = = = Subgroups = = = 
 Informally , a subgroup is a group H contained within a bigger one , G. Concretely , the identity element of G is contained in H , and whenever h1 and h2 are in H , then so are h1 • h2 and h1 − 1 , so the elements of H , equipped with the group operation on G restricted to H , indeed form a group . 
 In the example above , the identity and the rotations constitute a subgroup R 
 = { id , r1 , r2 , r3 } , highlighted in red in the group table above : any two rotations composed are still a rotation , and a rotation can be undone by ( i.e. is inverse to ) the complementary rotations 270 ° for 90 ° , 180 ° for 180 ° , and 90 ° for 270 ° ( note that rotation in the opposite direction is not defined ) . The subgroup test is a necessary and sufficient condition for a nonempty subset H of a group G to be a subgroup : it is sufficient to check that g − 1h ∈ H for all elements g , h ∈ H. Knowing the subgroups is important in understanding the group as a whole . 
 Given any subset S of a group G , the subgroup generated by S consists of products of elements of S and their inverses . It is the smallest subgroup of G containing S. In the introductory example above , the subgroup generated by r2 and fv consists of these two elements , the identity element id and fh = 
 fv • r2 . Again , this is a subgroup , because combining any two of these four elements or their inverses ( which are , in this particular case , these same elements ) yields an element of this subgroup . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 In many situations it is desirable to consider two group elements the same if they differ by an element of a given subgroup . For example , in D4 above , once a reflection is performed , the square never gets back to the r2 configuration by just applying the rotation operations ( and no further reflections ) , i.e. the rotation operations are irrelevant to the question whether a reflection has been performed . <unk> are used to formalize this insight : a subgroup H defines left and right cosets , which can be thought of as translations of H by arbitrary group elements g . In symbolic terms , the left and right cosets of H containing g are 
 <unk> 
 = { g • h : h ∈ H } and Hg = 
 { h • g : h ∈ H } , respectively . 
 The left cosets of any subgroup H form a partition of G ; that is , the union of all left cosets is equal to G and two left cosets are either equal or have an empty intersection . The first case <unk> 
 = <unk> happens precisely when g1 − 1 • g2 ∈ H , i.e. if the two elements differ by an element of H. Similar considerations apply to the right cosets of H. The left and right cosets of H may or may not be equal . If they are , i.e. for all g in G , <unk> = 
 Hg , then H is said to be a normal subgroup . 
 In D4 , the introductory symmetry group , the left cosets <unk> of the subgroup R consisting of the rotations are either equal to R , if g is an element of R itself , or otherwise equal to U 
 = fcR = 
 { fc , fv , fd , fh } ( highlighted in green ) . The subgroup R is also normal , because fcR 
 = U = 
 <unk> and similarly for any element other than fc . ( In fact , in the case of D4 , observe that all such cosets are equal , such that <unk> 
 = fvR = 
 <unk> = fcR . ) 
 = = = Quotient groups = = = 
 In some situations the set of cosets of a subgroup can be endowed with a group law , giving a quotient group or factor group . For this to be possible , the subgroup has to be normal . Given any normal subgroup N , the quotient group is defined by 
 G / N 
 = { gN , g ∈ G } , " G modulo N " . 
 This set inherits a group operation ( sometimes called coset multiplication , or coset addition ) from the original group G : ( gN ) • ( <unk> ) = 
 ( gh ) N for all g and h in G. This definition is motivated by the idea ( itself an instance of general structural considerations outlined above ) that the map G → G / N that associates to any element g its coset gN be a group homomorphism , or by general abstract considerations called universal properties . The coset <unk> 
 = N serves as the identity in this group , and the inverse of gN in the quotient group is ( gN ) − 1 = 
 ( g − 1 ) N. 
 The elements of the quotient group D4 / R are R itself , which represents the identity , and U 
 = fvR . The group operation on the quotient is shown at the right . For example , U • U = 
 fvR • fvR 
 = ( fv • fv ) R = 
 R. Both the subgroup R 
 = { id , r1 , r2 , r3 } , as well as the corresponding quotient are abelian , whereas D4 is not abelian . Building bigger groups by smaller ones , such as D4 from its subgroup R and the quotient D4 / R is abstracted by a notion called <unk> product . 
 Quotient groups and subgroups together form a way of describing every group by its presentation : any group is the quotient of the free group over the generators of the group , <unk> by the subgroup of relations . The dihedral group D4 , for example , can be generated by two elements r and f ( for example , r = 
 r1 , the right rotation and f 
 = fv the vertical ( or any other ) reflection ) , which means that every symmetry of the square is a finite composition of these two symmetries or their inverses . Together with the relations

 the group is completely described . A presentation of a group can also be used to construct the Cayley graph , a device used to graphically capture discrete groups . 
 <unk> and quotient groups are related in the following way : a subset H of G can be seen as an injective map H → G , i.e. any element of the target has at most one element that maps to it . The counterpart to injective maps are surjective maps ( every element of the target is mapped onto ) , such as the canonical map G → G / N. Interpreting subgroup and quotients in light of these homomorphisms emphasizes the structural concept inherent to these definitions alluded to in the introduction . In general , homomorphisms are neither injective nor surjective . Kernel and image of group homomorphisms and the first isomorphism theorem address this phenomenon . 
 = = Examples and applications = = 
 Examples and applications of groups abound . A starting point is the group Z of integers with addition as group operation , introduced above . If instead of addition multiplication is considered , one obtains multiplicative groups . These groups are predecessors of important constructions in abstract algebra . 
 Groups are also applied in many other mathematical areas . Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups . For example , Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group . By means of this connection , topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups . For example , elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops . The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point . The blue loop is considered null @-@ homotopic ( and thus irrelevant ) , because it can be continuously shrunk to a point . The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point . The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic , generated by the orange loop ( or any other loop winding once around the hole ) . This way , the fundamental group detects the hole . 
 In more recent applications , the influence has also been reversed to motivate geometric constructions by a group @-@ theoretical background . In a similar vein , geometric group theory employs geometric concepts , for example in the study of hyperbolic groups . Further branches crucially applying groups include algebraic geometry and number theory . 
 In addition to the above theoretical applications , many practical applications of groups exist . Cryptography relies on the combination of the abstract group theory approach together with <unk> knowledge obtained in computational group theory , in particular when implemented for finite groups . Applications of group theory are not restricted to mathematics ; sciences such as physics , chemistry and computer science benefit from the concept . 
 = = = Numbers = = = 
 Many number systems , such as the integers and the rationals enjoy a naturally given group structure . In some cases , such as with the rationals , both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures . Such number systems are predecessors to more general algebraic structures known as rings and fields . Further abstract algebraic concepts such as modules , vector spaces and algebras also form groups . 
 = = = = Integers = = = = 
 The group of integers Z under addition , denoted ( Z , + ) , has been described above . The integers , with the operation of multiplication instead of addition , ( Z , · ) do not form a group . The closure , associativity and identity axioms are satisfied , but inverses do not exist : for example , a 
 = 2 is an integer , but the only solution to the equation a · b = 
 1 in this case is b = 1 / 2 , which is a rational number , but not an integer . Hence not every element of Z has a ( multiplicative ) inverse . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 The desire for the existence of multiplicative inverses suggests considering fractions 
 <formula> 
 Fractions of integers ( with b nonzero ) are known as rational numbers . The set of all such fractions is commonly denoted Q. There is still a minor obstacle for ( Q , · ) , the rationals with multiplication , being a group : because the rational number 0 does not have a multiplicative inverse ( i.e. , there is no x such that x · 0 
 = 1 ) , ( Q , · ) is still not a group . 
 However , the set of all nonzero rational numbers Q ∖ { 0 } = 
 { q ∈ Q | q ≠ 0 } does form an abelian group under multiplication , denoted ( Q ∖ { 0 } , · ) . Associativity and identity element axioms follow from the properties of integers . The closure requirement still holds true after removing zero , because the product of two nonzero rationals is never zero . Finally , the inverse of a / b is b / a , therefore the axiom of the inverse element is satisfied . 
 The rational numbers ( including 0 ) also form a group under addition . Intertwining addition and multiplication operations yields more complicated structures called rings and — if division is possible , such as in Q — fields , which occupy a central position in abstract algebra . Group theoretic arguments therefore underlie parts of the theory of those entities . 
 = = = Modular arithmetic = = = 
 In modular arithmetic , two integers are added and then the sum is divided by a positive integer called the modulus . The result of modular addition is the remainder of that division . For any modulus , n , the set of integers from 0 to n − 1 forms a group under modular addition : the inverse of any element a is n − a , and 0 is the identity element . This is familiar from the addition of hours on the face of a clock : if the hour hand is on 9 and is advanced 4 hours , it ends up on 1 , as shown at the right . This is expressed by saying that 9 + 4 equals 1 " modulo 12 " or , in symbols , 
 9 + 4 ≡ 1 modulo 12 . 
 The group of integers modulo n is written Zn or Z / <unk> . 
 For any prime number p , there is also the multiplicative group of integers modulo p . Its elements are the integers 1 to p − 1 . The group operation is multiplication modulo p . That is , the usual product is divided by p and the remainder of this division is the result of modular multiplication . For example , if p 
 = 5 , there are four group elements 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . In this group , 4 · 4 = 
 1 , because the usual product 16 is equivalent to 1 , which divided by 5 yields a remainder of 1 @.@ for 5 divides 16 − 1 
 = 15 , denoted 
 16 ≡ 1 ( mod 5 ) . 
 The <unk> of p ensures that the product of two integers neither of which is divisible by p is not divisible by p either , hence the indicated set of classes is closed under multiplication . The identity element is 1 , as usual for a multiplicative group , and the associativity follows from the corresponding property of integers . Finally , the inverse element axiom requires that given an integer a not divisible by p , there exists an integer b such that 
 a · b ≡ 1 ( mod p ) , i.e. p divides the difference a · b − 1 . 
 The inverse b can be found by using Bézout 's identity and the fact that the greatest common divisor gcd ( a , p ) equals 1 . In the case p = 
 5 above , the inverse of 4 is 4 , and the inverse of 3 is 2 , as 3 · 2 = 6 ≡ 1 ( mod 5 ) . Hence all group axioms are fulfilled . Actually , this example is similar to ( Q ∖ { 0 } , · ) above : it consists of exactly those elements in Z / <unk> that have a multiplicative inverse . These groups are denoted Fp × . They are crucial to public @-@ key cryptography . 
 = = = Cyclic groups = = = 
 A cyclic group is a group all of whose elements are powers of a particular element a . In multiplicative notation , the elements of the group are : 
 ... , a − 3 , a − 2 , a − 1 , a0 
 = e , a , a2 , a3 , ... , 
 where a2 means a • a , and a − 3 stands for a − 1 • a − 1 • a − 1 = 
 ( a • a • a ) − 1 etc . Such an element a is called a generator or a primitive element of the group . In additive notation , the requirement for an element to be primitive is that each element of the group can be written as 
 ... , − a − a , − a , 0 , a , a + a , ... 
 In the groups Z / <unk> introduced above , the element 1 is primitive , so these groups are cyclic . Indeed , each element is expressible as a sum all of whose terms are 1 . Any cyclic group with n elements is isomorphic to this group . A second example for cyclic groups is the group of n @-@ th complex roots of unity , given by complex numbers z satisfying zn 
 = 1 . These numbers can be visualized as the vertices on a regular n @-@ gon , as shown in blue at the right for n = 
 6 . The group operation is multiplication of complex numbers . In the picture , multiplying with z corresponds to a counter @-@ clockwise rotation by 60 ° . Using some field theory , the group Fp × can be shown to be cyclic : for example , if p 
 = 5 , 3 is a generator since 31 = 
 3 , 32 = 9 ≡ 4 , 33 ≡ 2 , and 34 ≡ 1 . 
 Some cyclic groups have an infinite number of elements . In these groups , for every non @-@ zero element a , all the powers of a are distinct ; despite the name " cyclic group " , the powers of the elements do not cycle . An infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to ( Z , + ) , the group of integers under addition introduced above . As these two prototypes are both abelian , so is any cyclic group . 
 The study of finitely generated abelian groups is quite mature , including the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups ; and reflecting this state of affairs , many group @-@ related notions , such as center and <unk> , describe the extent to which a given group is not abelian . 
 = = = Symmetry groups = = = 
 Symmetry groups are groups consisting of symmetries of given mathematical objects — be they of geometric nature , such as the introductory symmetry group of the square , or of algebraic nature , such as polynomial equations and their solutions . Conceptually , group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry . Symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects . A group is said to act on another mathematical object X if every group element performs some operation on X <unk> to the group law . In the rightmost example below , an element of order 7 of the ( 2 @,@ 3 @,@ 7 ) triangle group acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles ( and the other ones , too ) . By a group action , the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on . 
 In chemical fields , such as crystallography , space groups and point groups describe molecular symmetries and crystal symmetries . These symmetries underlie the chemical and physical behavior of these systems , and group theory enables simplification of quantum mechanical analysis of these properties . For example , group theory is used to show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur simply because of the symmetry of the states involved . 
 Not only are groups useful to assess the implications of symmetries in molecules , but surprisingly they also predict that molecules sometimes can change symmetry . The Jahn @-@ Teller effect is a distortion of a molecule of high symmetry when it adopts a particular ground state of lower symmetry from a set of possible ground states that are related to each other by the symmetry operations of the molecule . 
 Likewise , group theory helps predict the changes in physical properties that occur when a material undergoes a phase transition , for example , from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form . An example is ferroelectric materials , where the change from a <unk> to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high @-@ symmetry <unk> state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state , accompanied by a so @-@ called soft phonon mode , a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition . 
 Such spontaneous symmetry breaking has found further application in elementary particle physics , where its occurrence is related to the appearance of Goldstone bosons . 
 Finite symmetry groups such as the Mathieu groups are used in coding theory , which is in turn applied in error correction of transmitted data , and in CD players . Another application is differential Galois theory , which characterizes functions having <unk> of a prescribed form , giving group @-@ theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain differential equations are well @-@ behaved . Geometric properties that remain stable under group actions are investigated in ( geometric ) invariant theory . 
 = = = General linear group and representation theory = = = 
 Matrix groups consist of matrices together with matrix multiplication . The general linear group GL ( n , R ) consists of all invertible n @-@ by @-@ n matrices with real entries . Its subgroups are referred to as matrix groups or linear groups . The dihedral group example mentioned above can be viewed as a ( very small ) matrix group . Another important matrix group is the special orthogonal group SO ( n ) . It describes all possible rotations in n dimensions . Via Euler angles , rotation matrices are used in computer graphics . 
 Representation theory is both an application of the group concept and important for a deeper understanding of groups . It studies the group by its group actions on other spaces . A broad class of group representations are linear representations , i.e. the group is acting on a vector space , such as the three @-@ dimensional Euclidean space R3 . A representation of G on an n @-@ dimensional real vector space is simply a group homomorphism 
 ρ : G → GL ( n , R ) 
 from the group to the general linear group . This way , the group operation , which may be abstractly given , translates to the multiplication of matrices making it accessible to explicit computations . 
 Given a group action , this gives further means to study the object being acted on . On the other hand , it also yields information about the group . Group representations are an organizing principle in the theory of finite groups , Lie groups , algebraic groups and topological groups , especially ( locally ) compact groups . 
 = = = Galois groups = = = 
 Galois groups were developed to help solve polynomial equations by capturing their symmetry features . For example , the solutions of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are given by 
 <formula> 
 <unk> " + " and " − " in the expression , i.e. permuting the two solutions of the equation can be viewed as a ( very simple ) group operation . Similar formulae are known for cubic and quartic equations , but do not exist in general for degree 5 and higher . Abstract properties of Galois groups associated with polynomials ( in particular their solvability ) give a criterion for polynomials that have all their solutions expressible by radicals , i.e. solutions expressible using solely addition , multiplication , and roots similar to the formula above . 
 The problem can be dealt with by shifting to field theory and considering the splitting field of a polynomial . Modern Galois theory generalizes the above type of Galois groups to field extensions and establishes — via the fundamental theorem of Galois theory — a precise relationship between fields and groups , underlining once again the ubiquity of groups in mathematics . 
 = = Finite groups = = 
 A group is called finite if it has a finite number of elements . The number of elements is called the order of the group . An important class is the symmetric groups SN , the groups of permutations of N letters . For example , the symmetric group on 3 letters S3 is the group consisting of all possible orderings of the three letters ABC , i.e. contains the elements ABC , ACB , ... , up to CBA , in total 6 ( or 3 factorial ) elements . This class is fundamental insofar as any finite group can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group SN for a suitable integer N ( Cayley 's theorem ) . Parallel to the group of symmetries of the square above , S3 can also be interpreted as the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle . 
 The order of an element a in a group G is the least positive integer n such that a n = e , where a n represents 
 <formula> 
 i.e. application of the operation • to n copies of a . ( If • represents multiplication , then an corresponds to the nth power of a . ) In infinite groups , such an n may not exist , in which case the order of a is said to be infinity . The order of an element equals the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by this element . 
 More sophisticated counting techniques , for example counting cosets , yield more precise statements about finite groups : Lagrange 's Theorem states that for a finite group G the order of any finite subgroup H divides the order of G. The <unk> theorems give a partial converse . 
 The dihedral group ( discussed above ) is a finite group of order 8 . The order of r1 is 4 , as is the order of the subgroup R it generates ( see above ) . The order of the reflection elements fv etc. is 2 . Both orders divide 8 , as predicted by Lagrange 's theorem . The groups Fp × above have order p − 1 . 
 = = = Classification of finite simple groups = = = 
 Mathematicians often strive for a complete classification ( or list ) of a mathematical notion . In the context of finite groups , this aim leads to difficult mathematics . According to Lagrange 's theorem , finite groups of order p , a prime number , are necessarily cyclic ( abelian ) groups Zp . Groups of order p2 can also be shown to be abelian , a statement which does not generalize to order p3 , as the non @-@ abelian group D4 of order 8 = 23 above shows . Computer algebra systems can be used to list small groups , but there is no classification of all finite groups . An intermediate step is the classification of finite simple groups . A nontrivial group is called simple if its only normal subgroups are the trivial group and the group itself . The Jordan – Hölder theorem exhibits finite simple groups as the building blocks for all finite groups . Listing all finite simple groups was a major achievement in contemporary group theory . 1998 Fields Medal winner Richard <unk> succeeded in proving the monstrous moonshine conjectures , a surprising and deep relation between the largest finite simple sporadic group — the " monster group " — and certain modular functions , a piece of classical complex analysis , and string theory , a theory supposed to unify the description of many physical phenomena . 
 = = Groups with additional structure = = 
 Many groups are simultaneously groups and examples of other mathematical structures . In the language of category theory , they are group objects in a category , meaning that they are objects ( that is , examples of another mathematical structure ) which come with transformations ( called morphisms ) that mimic the group axioms . For example , every group ( as defined above ) is also a set , so a group is a group object in the category of sets . 
 = = = Topological groups = = = 
 Some topological spaces may be endowed with a group law . In order for the group law and the topology to interweave well , the group operations must be continuous functions , that is , g • h , and g − 1 must not vary wildly if g and h vary only little . Such groups are called topological groups , and they are the group objects in the category of topological spaces . The most basic examples are the reals R under addition , ( R ∖ { 0 } , · ) , and similarly with any other topological field such as the complex numbers or p @-@ adic numbers . All of these groups are locally compact , so they have Haar measures and can be studied via harmonic analysis . The former offer an abstract formalism of invariant integrals . <unk> means , in the case of real numbers for example : 
 <formula> 
 for any constant c . Matrix groups over these fields fall under this regime , as do <unk> rings and <unk> algebraic groups , which are basic to number theory . Galois groups of infinite field extensions such as the absolute Galois group can also be equipped with a topology , the so @-@ called Krull topology , which in turn is central to generalize the above sketched connection of fields and groups to infinite field extensions . An advanced generalization of this idea , adapted to the needs of algebraic geometry , is the <unk> fundamental group . 
 = = = Lie groups = = = 
 Lie groups ( in honor of Sophus Lie ) are groups which also have a manifold structure , i.e. they are spaces looking locally like some Euclidean space of the appropriate dimension . Again , the additional structure , here the manifold structure , has to be compatible , i.e. the maps corresponding to multiplication and the inverse have to be smooth . 
 A standard example is the general linear group introduced above : it is an open subset of the space of all n @-@ by @-@ n matrices , because it is given by the inequality 
 det ( A ) ≠ 0 @,@ 
 where A denotes an n @-@ by @-@ n matrix . 
 Lie groups are of fundamental importance in modern physics : Noether 's theorem links continuous symmetries to conserved quantities . Rotation , as well as translations in space and time are basic symmetries of the laws of mechanics . They can , for instance , be used to construct simple models — imposing , say , axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description . Another example are the Lorentz transformations , which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other . They can be deduced in a purely group @-@ theoretical way , by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space . The latter serves — in the absence of significant gravitation — as a model of space time in special relativity . The full symmetry group of Minkowski space , i.e. including translations , is known as the Poincaré group . By the above , it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and , by implication , for quantum field theories . Symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of gauge theory . 
 = = Generalizations = = 
 In abstract algebra , more general structures are defined by relaxing some of the axioms defining a group . For example , if the requirement that every element has an inverse is eliminated , the resulting algebraic structure is called a monoid . The natural numbers N ( including 0 ) under addition form a monoid , as do the nonzero integers under multiplication ( Z ∖ { 0 } , · ) , see above . There is a general method to formally add inverses to elements to any ( abelian ) monoid , much the same way as ( Q ∖ { 0 } , · ) is derived from ( Z ∖ { 0 } , · ) , known as the <unk> group . <unk> are similar to groups except that the composition a • b need not be defined for all a and b . They arise in the study of more complicated forms of symmetry , often in topological and analytical structures , such as the fundamental <unk> or stacks . Finally , it is possible to generalize any of these concepts by replacing the binary operation with an arbitrary n @-@ ary one ( i.e. an operation taking n arguments ) . With the proper generalization of the group axioms this gives rise to an n @-@ ary group . The table gives a list of several structures generalizing groups .

 = = Plot = = 
 In a flashback , Lori Grimes ( Sarah Wayne Callies ) is talking with other mothers about a fight she had with her husband , Rick Grimes ( Andrew Lincoln ) . Rick 's partner , Shane Walsh ( Jon Bernthal ) , pulls up in a police cruiser and tells Lori that Rick has been severely wounded in a highway shootout . Lori then tells her and Rick 's son , Carl ( Chandler Riggs ) the news , causing him to break down in tears . 
 In the present , Carl has been accidentally shot by a man named Otis ( Pruitt Taylor Vince ) , who was hunting for deer . Otis brings Rick , Carl and Shane to a veterinarian named Hershel Greene ( Scott Wilson ) , for whom Otis works as a farm hand . Hershel lives with his daughters Maggie ( Lauren Cohan ) and Beth ( Emily Kinney ) , Beth 's boyfriend Jimmy ( James Allen McCune ) , and Otis ' wife Patricia ( Jane McNeill ) . He treats Carl , but he reveals that the bullet was broken into six fragments . Rick must donate blood to Carl in order to keep him alive . 
 Lori , Glenn ( Steven Yeun ) , Carol Peletier ( Melissa McBride ) , Daryl Dixon ( Norman Reedus ) and Andrea ( Laurie Holden ) are still searching for Carol 's daughter Sophia ( Madison Lintz ) , when they overhear a gunshot . Meanwhile , on the highway , Dale Horvath ( Jeffrey DeMunn ) believes that T @-@ Dog ( IronE Singleton ) has contracted a blood infection from a wound he received in the previous episode , and both search for antibiotics , but they fail to find any . 
 At the Greene home , Hershel reveals that Carl needs major surgery to live , and that he will need a respirator . Otis suggests that they might find supplies at a nearby high school – where the Federal Emergency Management Agency has set up a trailer – although the place is likely overrun with walkers . Otis and Shane decide to get the supplies , while Maggie retrieves Lori from the group and brings her to the Greene home . Rick and Hershel discuss the walker epidemic ; Rick believes there is no cure , while Hershel has faith that there could be one . 
 The group searching for Sophia returns to the highway , where Daryl reveals that he has a bag containing painkillers and doxycycline antibiotics that T @-@ Dog can take . Shane and Otis retrieve the supplies , but are spotted by walkers . The two have no choice but to barricade themselves in the high school .

 " Bloodletting " was written by Glen Mazzara and directed by Ernest Dickerson . In June 2011 , it was announced that Scott Wilson , Lauren Cohan , and Pruitt Taylor Vince would appear on the second season as recurring characters . In an interview with TV Guide , Gale Anne Hurd explained that Wilson 's character , Hershel Greene , served as a patriarchal figure for the group . She continued : " He 's a veterinarian with a great sense of humanity and a very unique take on the [ walkers ] . " According to Hurd , Scott Wilson was cast because of his " tremendous scope and gravitas " . Hurd also stated that Cohan 's character , Greene 's daughter Maggie , was a woman in her twenties who eventually becomes a romantic interest for Glenn ( Steven Yeun ) . Further , Cohan added in an interview with the Philadelphia Daily News that Maggie was a Christian from a sheltered background . In preparation for her role , she spent a few months in Los Angeles , California to work with a dialect coach . Emily Kinney also joined the cast as Hershel 's younger daughter and Maggie 's half @-@ sister , Beth . 
 Principal photography commenced in Newnan , Georgia at Newnan High School in July 2011 , after approval was received from the city council and the Coweta County School System . Site preparation initiated on July 1 , and filming began at the gymnasium of the school over a period of four days from July 7 – 8 and again from July 11 – 12 . The location was temporarily renovated to mirror an abandoned Federal Emergency Management Agency camp . Michael Riley , the production manager for the episode , contacted the Newnan Police Department to collaborate with producers . Because of the large size of the filming location , Riley 's production company notified surrounding neighborhoods , to avoid inconvenience . 
 " Bloodletting " begins with a flashback of Rick Grimes ' relationship with Lori , before she became romantically linked to Shane . In an interview with Entertainment Weekly , Robert Kirkman asserted that it " speaks to Shane and his relationship to Lori and Rick in the early days . " He continued : 
 " A lot of people think of Shane as a clear villain and that he did a bad thing . But if you really analyze that situation , he ’ s a good guy and has done the right thing at every turn . Because he 's done that , and it ’ s not working out for him , it ’ s driving him crazy . So we really wanted to show that he ’ s a tragic figure much more than a villainous figure . It ’ s just a series of unfortunate situations that have led to him slowly losing himself in this world . Popping back in time and showing his concern for Rick and how he cares for Lori and Carl , I thought that would be a good thing to do . " 
 During a scene on the road , Daryl reveals a plastic bag of Merle 's drug stash he originally kept in hiding from the crew , only bringing it out to aid T @-@ Dog 's rising fever . In the bag are <unk> ( because , Daryl explains , Merle occasionally catches the clap ) , painkillers , ecstasy , and methamphetamine . The meth is blue , leading to speculations that it was a reference to the famous blue meth prepared by Walter White in the television series , Breaking Bad . In his interview in the after @-@ show Talking Dead , Kirkman stated that the scene was " a little Easter egg we were doing for AMC fans . "

 The episode was well received by television critics . Ology writer Josh Harrison gave the episode a nine out of ten rating , and opined that the episode was a " home run episode " for the series . Harrison continued : " Its central conflict is intense , its action is solid , and its new arrivals are engaging characters in their own right . Light on the gore and heavy on the drama — just how I like my Sunday night zombie adventures . " Scott Meslow from The Atlantic gave the episode a positive review , deeming it as an improvement from the previous episode , and appreciated that the episode had opened up new plot points for future episodes to come . Meslow wrote , " At the bare minimum , The Walking Dead should be exciting , and the final moments of " Bloodletting " provides more than enough action . " Echoing similar sentiments , Catherine Gee of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode a 3 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars , and compared it to the second season premiere , opining : " It may have been a calmer episode but there was no shortage of story to chew on . " Joe Oesterle of Mania.com commended the opening sequence of the episode , and praised the performances of Lincoln and Bernthal . Oesterle wrote , " Andrew Lincoln and Jon Bernthal [ ... ] gave a fine bit of acting , and I found it interesting how the character Rick started looking and walking a little bit <unk> after giving blood . The scenes between the two men were moving , and if you listened close you could decipher the main differences between these two cowboy cops . Rick is bound and determined to get back to his wife and let her know their son is in mortal danger , without ever doubting his own ability to successfully complete the mission , while Shane on the other hand is not quite as automatically selfless and heroic . " In conclusion , Oesterle gave " Bloodletting " a ' B ' grade . Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8 @.@ 5 out of ten , signaling a " great " response . Goldman stated that it was an improvement over the last episode , and that it had a great scare moment and cliffhanger . Similarly , Paste 's Josh Jackson gave the episode an 8 @.@ 3 out of ten rating , signifying a " commendable " rating . Steve West of Cinema Blend expressed that " Bloodletting " was superior to the previous episode , opining that it was " a character strengthening episode . " He continued : " Even those throwaway threads are immensely important to what ’ s about to go down at the Green farm . " 
 Some television critics were less enthusiastic about the episode . Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club felt that the episode was inferior to the previous episode , deeming it tedious . He wrote , " ' Bloodletting ' was a step down from last week 's première , mostly because it focused more on conversations than scares . Much as I want this show to find some way to do its characters right , those conversations were bland , providing no new information beyond , hey , it would suck to have your son get shot in front of you , huh ? " Concluding his review , Handlen gave the episode a ' B – ' grade . In concurrence , Nate Rawlings of Time stated : " For an episode titled ' Bloodletting ' there was surprisingly little of it last night . What we got instead were outpourings of emotion and frustration . Two entries in , and it 's already clear that the show wants to strike a balance between gore and humanity . " Andrew Conrad of the Chicago Tribune was unhappy with the episode ; he expressed disappointment with the low amount of zombie sequences , writing , " It must be a bit of a relief for the show 's make @-@ up department , but I 'd like to see at least one walker every ten minutes or so .

 = Typhoon Maria ( 2006 ) = 
 Typhoon Maria was a weak typhoon which brushed the southeastern coast of Japan during early August 2006 . The seventh named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season , Maria formed out of a tropical depression over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean . On August 5 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the depression as a tropical storm while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) kept it as a depression . The storm quickly strengthened into a typhoon the next day , reaching its peak intensity with winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph 10 @-@ minute winds ) early on August 6 . The storm gradually weakened as it began to recurve , causing it to parallel the southeastern coast of Japan . On August 9 , Maria weakened into a tropical depression and later into an extratropical cyclone before dissipating on August 15 . Maria had only minor effects in Japan , mainly heavy rains which were estimated to have peaked over 400 mm ( 15 @.@ 7 in ) on the Izu Peninsula . One person was killed after being struck by lightning and six others were injured . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On August 3 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) began monitoring a tropical depression located to the southeast of Minami Torishima Island . The depression slowly developed as it moved towards the west @-@ northwest . At 1630 UTC on August 5 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the developing system while it was located about 740 km ( 460 mi ) east @-@ northeast of the northern Mariana Islands . Deep convection was present around the center of circulation but the overall structure of the storm resembled a subtropical cyclone . However , the storm was likely to intensify as it was located within an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear with favorable diffulence aloft . Later that day , the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Maria ; a name submitted by the United States and a common Chamorro feminine name . Maria continued towards the west @-@ northwest along the edge of a broad subtropical ridge located east of Japan . 
 As the JMA issued their first advisory , the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Depression 09W while located about 280 km ( 175 mi ) east @-@ northeast of Iwo Jima . Early the next day , the JMA classified Maria as a severe tropical storm with winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph 10 @-@ minute winds ) while the JTWC reported that Maria had just become a tropical storm with winds reaching 75 km / h ( 45 mph 1 @-@ minute winds ) . The storm also had a slight northward relocation . Tracking towards the northwest , the storm intensified into a typhoon and reached its peak intensity with winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph 10 @-@ minute winds ) and minimum pressure of 975 hPa ( mbar ) at 0900 UTC . Around the same time , the JTWC assessed the storm to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph 1 @-@ minute winds ) . However , the JTWC operationally classified Maria as a minimal typhoon with winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph 1 @-@ minute winds ) on August 7 . 
 On August 7 , a banding eye feature developed with deep convection around the eastern portion of the storm . Later that day , the storm sharply recurved towards the northeast and paralleled the southern coastline of Honshu . As Maria made the turn , dry air began to enter the system , causing it to weaken . Along with the dry air , wind shear began to increase and the JMA downgraded Maria to a severe tropical storm early on August 8 . The storm continued to weaken as it came very close to landfall near Tokyo , Japan on August 9 . Both agencies downgraded Maria to a tropical depression early on August 9 , with the JTWC issuing their final advisory at that time . Maria remained a tropical depression for another 24 hours before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on August 10 while located about 835 km ( 520 mi ) east @-@ northeast of Tokyo . The extratropical remnants turned towards the north and dissipated late on August 14 over the Sea of Okhotsk .

 Weather officials warned residents about heavy rains , strong winds , and high waves in the Tōkai region , Kantō region , <unk> <unk> region , and the Izu Islands between August 8 and 9 . Seven flights out of Tokyo at Haneda airport were cancelled due to Maria . The JR Ito Line , an express train line , was temporarily shut down as a result of rain . As Maria brushed Japan , it produced heavy rains over the southeastern areas of the country . Yokota Air Base recorded 38 @.@ 1 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) of rainfall and winds up to 34 km / h ( 21 mph ) . Parts of the Izu Peninsula recorded rainfall in excess of 400 mm ( 15 @.@ 7 in ) over a two @-@ day span , peaking at 458 mm ( 18 @.@ 0 in ) in Tokyo . In Gifu Prefecture , thunderstorms associated with the typhoon resulted in a landslide that knocked out power to 510 residences . One man was injured and two cows died after a small farm was severely damaged by high winds . Flooding and landslides affected dozens of homes in Chōshi , Chiba , prompting the evacuation of 63 families . One person was killed in Tokyo after being struck by lightning . Five people were injured when a plane headed for Tokyo encountered turbulence produced by Maria . 
 = Climate of India = 
 The climate of India comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a vast geographic scale and varied topography , making generalisations difficult . Based on the Köppen system , India hosts six major climatic subtypes , ranging from arid desert in the west , alpine tundra and glaciers in the north , and humid tropical regions supporting rainforests in the southwest and the island territories . Many regions have starkly different microclimates . The nation has four seasons : winter ( January and February ) , summer ( March , April and May ) , a monsoon ( rainy ) season ( June to September ) , and a post @-@ monsoon period ( October , November and December ) . 
 India 's geography and geology are climatically pivotal : the Thar Desert in the northwest and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to effect a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime . As Earth 's highest and most massive mountain range , the Himalayas bars the influx of frigid katabatic winds from the icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia . Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter ; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer . 
 Though the Tropic of Cancer — the boundary between the tropics and subtropics — passes through the middle of India , the bulk of the country can be regarded as climatically tropical . As in much of the tropics , monsoonal and other weather patterns in India can be wildly unstable : epochal droughts , floods , cyclones , and other natural disasters are sporadic , but have displaced or ended millions of human lives . There is one scientific opinion which states that South Asia is likely to see such climatic events , along with their aleatory unpredictability , to change in frequency and are likely to increase in severity . Ongoing and future vegetative changes and current sea level rises and the attendant inundation of India 's low @-@ lying coastal areas are other impacts , current or predicted , that are attributable to global warming . 
 = = History = = 
 During the Triassic period of some 251 – 199 @.@ 6 Ma , the Indian subcontinent was part of a vast supercontinent known as Pangaea . Despite its position within a high @-@ latitude belt at 55 – 75 ° S — as opposed to its current position between 5 and 35 ° N , latitudes now occupied by Greenland and parts of the Antarctic Peninsula — India likely experienced a humid temperate climate with warm and frost @-@ free weather , though with well @-@ defined seasons . India later merged into the southern supercontinent Gondwana , a process beginning some 550 – 500 Ma . During the Late Paleozoic , Gondwana extended from a point at or near the South Pole to near the equator , where the Indian craton ( stable continental crust ) was positioned , resulting in a mild climate favourable to hosting high @-@ biomass ecosystems . This is underscored by India 's vast coal reserves — much of it from the late Paleozoic sedimentary sequence — the fourth @-@ largest reserves in the world . During the Mesozoic , the world , including India , was considerably warmer than today . With the coming of the Carboniferous , global cooling stoked extensive glaciation , which spread northwards from South Africa towards India ; this cool period lasted well into the Permian . 
 Tectonic movement by the Indian Plate caused it to pass over a geologic hotspot — the Réunion hotspot — now occupied by the volcanic island of Réunion . This resulted in a massive flood basalt event that laid down the Deccan Traps some 60 – 68 Ma , at the end of the Cretaceous period . This may have contributed to the global Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event , which caused India to experience significantly reduced insolation . Elevated atmospheric levels of sulphur gases formed aerosols such as sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid , similar to those found in the atmosphere of Venus ; these precipitated as acid rain . Elevated carbon dioxide emissions also contributed to the greenhouse effect , causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared . Further climatic changes 20 million years ago , long after India had crashed into the Laurasian landmass , were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms . The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air , preventing it from reaching India ; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been . 
 = = Regions = = 
 India is home to an extraordinary variety of climatic regions , ranging from tropical in the south to temperate and alpine in the Himalayan north , where elevated regions receive sustained winter snowfall . The nation 's climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert . The Himalayas , along with the Hindu Kush mountains in Pakistan , prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in , keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes . Simultaneously , the Thar Desert plays a role in attracting moisture @-@ laden southwest summer monsoon winds that , between June and October , provide the majority of India 's rainfall . Four major climatic groupings predominate , into which fall seven climatic zones that , as designated by experts , are defined on the basis of such traits as temperature and precipitation . <unk> are assigned codes ( see chart ) according to the Köppen climate classification system . 
 = = = Tropical wet = = = 
 A tropical rainy climate governs regions experiencing persistent warm or high temperatures , which normally do not fall below 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) . India hosts two climatic <unk> tropical monsoon climate , tropical wet and dry climate that fall under this group . 
 1 ) The most humid is the tropical wet climate — also known as a tropical monsoon climate — that covers a strip of southwestern lowlands abutting the Malabar Coast , the Western Ghats , and southern Assam . India 's two island territories , Lakshadweep and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands , are also subject to this climate . Characterised by moderate to high year @-@ round temperatures , even in the foothills , its rainfall is seasonal but heavy — typically above 2 @,@ 000 mm ( 79 in ) per year . Most rainfall occurs between May and November ; this moisture is enough to sustain lush forests and other vegetation for the rest of the mainly dry year . December to March are the driest months , when days with precipitation are rare . The heavy monsoon rains are responsible for the exceptional biodiversity of tropical wet forests in parts of these regions . 
 2 ) In India a tropical wet and dry climate is more common . Noticeably drier than areas with a tropical monsoon climate , it prevails over most of inland peninsular India except for a semi arid rain shadow east of the Western Ghats . Winter and early summer are long and dry periods with temperatures averaging above 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) . Summer is exceedingly hot ; temperatures in low @-@ lying areas may exceed 50 ° C ( 122 ° F ) during May , leading to heat waves that can each kill hundreds of <unk> rainy season lasts from June to September ; annual rainfall averages between 750 – 1 @,@ 500 mm ( 30 – 59 in ) across the region . Once the dry northeast monsoon begins in September , most precipitation in India falls on Tamil Nadu , leaving other states comparatively dry . 
 The Ganges Delta lies mostly in the tropical wet climate zone : it receives between 1 @,@ 500 to 2 @,@ 000 mm ( 59 to 79 in ) of rainfall each year in the western part , and 2 @,@ 000 to 3 @,@ 000 mm ( 79 to 118 in ) in the eastern part . The coolest month of the year , on average , is January ; April and May are the warmest months . Average temperatures in January range from 14 to 25 ° C ( 57 to 77 ° F ) , and average temperatures in April range from 25 to 35 ° C ( 77 to 95 ° F ) . July is on average the wettest month : over 330 mm ( 13 in ) of rain falls on the delta . 
 = = = Tropical dry = = = 
 A tropical arid and semi @-@ arid climate dominates regions where the rate of moisture loss through evapotranspiration exceeds that from precipitation ; it is subdivided into three climatic <unk> tropical semi @-@ arid steppe , arid climate , tropical and sub @-@ tropical steppe climate . 
 1 ) The first , a tropical semi @-@ arid steppe climate , ( Hot semi @-@ arid climate ) predominates over a long stretch of land south of Tropic of Cancer and east of the Western Ghats and the Cardamom Hills . The region , which includes Karnataka , inland Tamil Nadu , western Andhra Pradesh , and central Maharashtra , gets between 400 – 750 millimetres ( 15 @.@ 7 – 29 @.@ 5 in ) annually . It is drought @-@ prone , as it tends to have less reliable rainfall due to sporadic lateness or failure of the southwest monsoon . Karnataka is divided into three zones – coastal , north interior and south interior . Of these , the coastal zone receives the heaviest rainfall with an average rainfall of about 3 @,@ 638 @.@ 5 mm per annum , far in excess of the state average of 1 @,@ 139 mm ( 45 in ) . In contrast to norm , Agumbe in the Shivamogga district receives the second highest annual rainfall in India . North of the Krishna River , the summer monsoon is responsible for most rainfall ; to the south , significant post @-@ monsoon rainfall also occurs in October and November . In December , the coldest month , temperatures still average around 20 – 24 ° C ( 68 – 75 ° F ) . The months between March to May are hot and dry ; mean monthly temperatures hover around 32 ° C , with 320 millimetres ( 13 in ) precipitation . Hence , without artificial irrigation , this region is not suitable for permanent agriculture . 
 2 ) Most of western Rajasthan experiences an arid climatic regime ( Hot desert climate ) . <unk> are responsible for virtually all of the region 's annual precipitation , which totals less than 300 millimetres ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) . Such bursts happen when monsoon winds sweep into the region during July , August , and September . Such rainfall is highly erratic ; regions experiencing rainfall one year may not see precipitation for the next couple of years or so . Atmospheric moisture is largely prevented from precipitating due to continuous downdrafts and other factors . The summer months of May and June are exceptionally hot ; mean monthly temperatures in the region hover around 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) , with daily maxima occasionally topping 50 ° C ( 122 ° F ) . During winters , temperatures in some areas can drop below freezing due to waves of cold air from Central Asia . There is a large diurnal range of about 14 ° C ( 25 @.@ 2 ° F ) during summer ; this widens by several degrees during winter . 
 To the west , in Gujarat , diverse climate conditions obtain . The winters are mild , pleasant , and dry with average daytime temperatures around 29 ° C ( 84 ° F ) and nights around 12 ° C ( 54 ° F ) with virtually full sun and clear nights . Summers are hot and dry with daytime temperatures around 41 ° C ( 106 ° F ) and nights no lower than 29 ° C ( 84 ° F ) . In the weeks before the monsoon temperatures are similar to the above , but high humidity makes the air more uncomfortable . Relief comes with the monsoon . Temperatures are around 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) but humidity is very high ; nights are around 27 ° C ( 81 ° F ) . Most of the rainfall occurs in this season , and the rain can cause severe floods . The sun is often occluded during the monsoon season . 
 3 ) East of the Thar Desert , the Punjab @-@ Haryana @-@ Kathiawar region experiences a tropical and sub @-@ tropical steppe climate . Haryana 's climate resembles other states of the northern plains : extreme summer heat of up to 50 ° C and winter cold as low as 1 ° C. May and June are hottest ; December and January are coldest . Rainfall is varied , with the Shivalik Hills region being the wettest and the <unk> Hills region being the driest . About 80 % of the rainfall occurs in the monsoon season of July – September , which can cause flooding . The Punjabi climate is also governed by extremes of hot and cold . Areas near the Himalayan foothills receive heavy rainfall whereas those <unk> from them are hot and dry . Punjab 's three @-@ season climate sees summer months that spans from mid @-@ April to the end of June . Temperatures typically range from – 2 ° C to 40 ° C , but can reach 47 ° C ( 117 ° F ) in summer and − 4 ° C in winter . The zone , a transitional climatic region separating tropical desert from humid sub @-@ tropical savanna and forests , experiences temperatures that are less extreme than those of the desert . Average annual rainfall is 300 – 650 millimetres ( 11 @.@ 8 – 25 @.@ 6 in ) , but is very unreliable ; as in much of the rest of India , the southwest monsoon accounts for most precipitation . Daily summer temperature maxima rise to around 40 ° C ( 104 ° F ) ; this results in natural vegetation typically comprises short , coarse grasses . 
 = = = Subtropical humid = = = 
 Most of Northeast India and much of North India are subject to a humid subtropical climate . Though they experience hot summers , temperatures during the coldest months may fall as low as 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) . Due to ample monsoon rains , India has only one subtype of this climate under the Köppen system : Cwa . In most of this region , there is very little precipitation during the winter , owing to powerful anticyclonic and katabatic ( downward @-@ flowing ) winds from Central Asia . 
 Humid subtropical regions are subject to pronounced dry winters . Winter rainfall — and occasionally snowfall — is associated with large storm systems such as " Nor 'westers " and " Western disturbances " ; the latter are steered by westerlies towards the Himalayas . Most summer rainfall occurs during powerful thunderstorms associated with the southwest summer monsoon ; occasional tropical cyclones also contribute . Annual rainfall ranges from less than 1 @,@ 000 millimetres ( 39 in ) in the west to over 2 @,@ 500 millimetres ( 98 in ) in parts of the northeast . As most of this region is far from the ocean , the wide temperature swings more characteristic of a continental climate predominate ; the swings are wider than in those in tropical wet regions , ranging from 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) in north @-@ central India to 27 ° C ( 81 ° F ) in the east . 
 = = = Mountain = = = 
 India 's northernmost areas are subject to a montane , or alpine , climate . In the Himalayas , the rate at which an air mass 's temperature falls per kilometre ( 3 @,@ 281 ft ) of altitude gained ( the dry adiabatic lapse rate ) is 9 @.@ 8 ° C / km . In terms of environmental lapse rate , ambient temperatures fall by 6 @.@ 5 ° C ( 11 @.@ 7 ° F ) for every 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 3 @,@ 281 ft ) rise in altitude . Thus , climates ranging from nearly tropical in the foothills to tundra above the snow line can coexist within several hundred metres of each other . Sharp temperature contrasts between sunny and shady slopes , high diurnal temperature variability , temperature inversions , and altitude @-@ dependent variability in rainfall are also common . 
 The northern side of the western Himalayas , also known as the trans @-@ Himalayan belt , has a cold desert climate . It is a region of barren , arid , frigid and wind @-@ blown wastelands . Areas south of the Himalayas are largely protected from cold winter winds coming in from the Asian interior . The leeward side ( northern face ) of the mountains receives less rain . 
 The southern slopes of the western Himalayas , well @-@ exposed to the monsoon , get heavy rainfall . Areas situated at elevations of 1 @,@ 070 – 2 @,@ 290 metres ( 3 @,@ 510 – 7 @,@ 510 ft ) receive the heaviest rainfall , which decreases rapidly at elevations above 2 @,@ 290 metres ( 7 @,@ 513 ft ) . Most precipitation occurs as snowfall during the late winter and spring <unk> Himalayas experience their heaviest snowfall between December and February and at elevations above 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 4 @,@ 921 ft ) . Snowfall increases with elevation by up to several dozen millimetres per 100 metre ( ~ 2 in ; 330 ft ) increase . Elevations above 6 @,@ 000 metres ( 19 @,@ 685 ft ) never experience rain ; all precipitation falls as snow . 
 = = Seasons = = 
 The India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) designates four climatological seasons : 
 Winter , occurring from December to March . The year 's coldest months are December and January , when temperatures average around 10 – 15 ° C ( 50 – 59 ° F ) in the northwest ; temperatures rise as one proceeds towards the equator , peaking around 20 – 25 ° C ( 68 – 77 ° F ) in mainland India 's southeast . 
 Summer or pre @-@ monsoon season , lasting from April to June ( April to July in northwestern India ) . In western and southern regions , the hottest month is April ; for northern regions of India , May is the hottest month . Temperatures average around 32 – 40 ° C ( 90 – 104 ° F ) in most of the interior . 
 Monsoon or rainy season , lasting from July to September . The season is dominated by the humid southwest summer monsoon , which slowly sweeps across the country beginning in late May or early June . Monsoon rains begin to recede from North India at the beginning of October . South India typically receives more rainfall . 
 Post @-@ monsoon or autumn season , lasting from October to November . In the northwest of India , October and November are usually cloudless . Tamil Nadu receives most of its annual precipitation in the northeast monsoon season . 
 The Himalayan states , being more temperate , experience an additional season , spring , which coincides with the first weeks of summer in southern India . Traditionally , Indians note six seasons or <unk> , each about two months long . These are the spring season ( Sanskrit : <unk> ) , summer ( <unk> ) , monsoon season ( <unk> ) , autumn ( <unk> ) , winter ( <unk> ) , and <unk> season ( <unk> ) . These are based on the astronomical division of the twelve months into six parts . The ancient Hindu calendar also reflects these seasons in its arrangement of months .

 Once the monsoons subside , average temperatures gradually fall across India . As the Sun 's vertical rays move south of the equator , most of the country experiences moderately cool weather ; temperatures change by about per degree of latitude . December and January are the coldest months , with mean temperatures of in Indian Himalayas . Mean temperatures are higher in the east and south . 
 In northwestern India region , virtually cloudless conditions prevail in October and November , resulting in wide diurnal temperature swings ; as in much of the Deccan Plateau , they register at 16 – 20 ° C ( 61 – 68 ° F ) . However , from January to February , " western disturbances " bring heavy bursts of rain and snow . These extra @-@ tropical low @-@ pressure systems originate in the eastern Mediterranean Sea . They are carried towards India by the subtropical westerlies , which are the prevailing winds blowing at North India 's range of latitude . Once their passage is hindered by the Himalayas , they are unable to proceed further , and they release significant precipitation over the southern Himalayas . 
 There is a huge variation in the climatic conditions of Himachal Pradesh due to variation in altitude ( 450 – 6500 metres ) . The climate varies from hot and sub @-@ humid tropical ( 450 – 900 metres ) in the southern low tracts , warm and temperate ( 900 – 1800 metres ) , cool and temperate ( 1900 – 2400 metres ) and cold glacial and alpine ( 2400 – 4800 metres ) in the northern and eastern high elevated mountain ranges . By October , nights and mornings are very cold . Snowfall at elevations of nearly 3000 m is about 3 m and lasts from December start to March end . Elevations above 4500 m support perpetual snow . The spring season starts from mid February to mid April . The weather is pleasant and comfortable in the season . The rainy season starts at the end of the month of June . The landscape <unk> green and fresh . During the season streams and natural springs are replenished . The heavy rains in July and August cause a lot of damage resulting in erosion , floods and landslides . Out of all the state districts , Dharamsala receives the highest rainfall , nearly about 3 @,@ 400 mm ( 134 in ) . Spiti is the driest area of the state , where annual rainfall is below 50 mm . The six Himalayan states ( Jammu and Kashmir in the extreme north , Himachal Pradesh , Uttarakhand , Sikkim , Northern West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh ) experience heavy snowfall , Manipur and Nagaland are not located in the Himalayas but experience snowfall ; in Jammu and Kashmir , blizzards occur regularly , disrupting travel and other activities . 
 The rest of North India , including the Indo @-@ Gangetic Plain and Madhya Pradesh almost never receives snow . Temperatures in the plains occasionally fall below freezing , though never for more one or two days . Winter highs in Delhi range from 16 to 21 ° C ( 61 to 70 ° F ) . Nighttime temperatures average 2 – 8 ° C ( 36 – 46 ° F ) . In the plains of Punjab , lows can fall below freezing , dropping to around − 6 ° C ( 21 ° F ) in Amritsar . Frost sometimes occurs , but the hallmark of the season is the notorious fog , which frequently disrupts daily life ; fog grows thick enough to hinder visibility and disrupt air travel 15 – 20 days annually . In Bihar in middle of the Ganges plain , hot weather sets in and the summer lasts until the middle of June . The highest temperature is often registered in May which is the hottest time . Like the rest of the north , Bihar also experiences dust @-@ storms , thunderstorms and dust raising winds during the hot season . Dust storms having a velocity of 48 – 64 km / h ( 30 – 40 mph ) are most frequent in May and with second maximum in April and June . The hot winds ( loo ) of Bihar plains blow during April and May with an average velocity of 8 – 16 km / h ( 5 – 10 mph ) . These hot winds greatly affects human comfort during this season . Rain follows . The rainy season begins in June . The rainiest months are July and August . The rains are the gifts of the southwest monsoon . There are in Bihar three distinct areas where rainfall exceeds 1 @,@ 800 mm ( 71 in ) . Two of them are in the northern and northwestern portions of the state ; the third lies in the area around <unk> . The southwest monsoon normally withdraws from Bihar in the first week of October . Eastern India 's climate is much milder , experiencing moderately warm days and cool nights . Highs range from 23 ° C ( 73 ° F ) in Patna to 26 ° C ( 79 ° F ) in Kolkata ( Calcutta ) ; lows average from 9 ° C ( 48 ° F ) in Patna to 14 ° C ( 57 ° F ) in Kolkata . In Madhya Pradesh which is towards the south @-@ western side of the Gangetic Plain similar conditions prevail albeit with much less humidity levels . Capital Bhopal averages low of 9 ° C ( 48 ° F ) and high of 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) . 
 Frigid winds from the Himalayas can depress temperatures near the Brahmaputra River . The Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan plateau by preventing frigid and dry Arctic winds from blowing south into the subcontinent , which keeps South Asia much warmer than corresponding temperate regions in the other continents . It also forms a barrier for the monsoon winds , keeping them from travelling northwards , and causing heavy rainfall in the Terai region instead . The Himalayas are indeed believed to play an important role in the formation of Central Asian deserts such as the Taklamakan and Gobi . The mountain ranges prevent western winter disturbances in Iran from travelling further east , resulting in much snow in Kashmir and rainfall for parts of Punjab and northern India . Despite being a barrier to the cold northerly winter winds , the Brahmaputra valley receives part of the frigid winds , thus lowering the temperature in Northeast India and Bangladesh . The Himalayas , which are often called " The Roof of the World " , contain the greatest area of glaciers and permafrost outside of the poles . Ten of Asia 's largest rivers flow from there . The two Himalayan states in the east , Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh , receive substantial snowfall . The extreme north of West Bengal centred on Darjeeling experiences snowfall , but only rarely . 
 In South India , particularly the hinterlands of Maharashtra , parts of Karnataka , and Andhra Pradesh , somewhat cooler weather prevails . Minimum temperatures in western Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh hover around 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) ; in the southern Deccan Plateau , they reach 16 ° C ( 61 ° F ) . Coastal areas — especially those near the Coromandel Coast and adjacent low @-@ elevation interior tracts — are warm , with daily high temperatures of 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) and lows of around 21 ° C ( 70 ° F ) . The Western Ghats , including the Nilgiri Range , are exceptional ; lows there can fall below freezing . This compares with a range of 12 – 14 ° C ( 54 – 57 ° F ) on the Malabar Coast ; there , as is the case for other coastal areas , the Indian Ocean exerts a strong moderating influence on weather . The region averages 800 millimetres ( 31 in ) per year , most of which falls between October and December . The topography of the Bay of Bengal and the staggered weather pattern prevalent during the season favours the northeast monsoon , which has a tendency to cause cyclones and hurricanes rather than steady precipitation . As a result , the coast is hit by what can mildly be termed as inclement weather almost every year between October and January .

 Summer in northwestern India starts from April and ends in July , and in the rest of the country from March to June . The temperatures in the north rise as the vertical rays of the Sun reach the Tropic of Cancer . The hottest month for the western and southern regions of the country is April ; for most of North India , it is May . Temperatures of 50 ° C ( 122 ° F ) and higher have been recorded in parts of India during this season . Another striking feature of summer is the Loo ( wind ) . These are strong , gusty , hot , dry winds that blow during the day in India . Direct exposure to these winds may be fatal . In cooler regions of North India , immense pre @-@ monsoon squall @-@ line thunderstorms , known locally as " Nor 'westers " , commonly drop large hailstones . In Himachal Pradesh , Summer lasts from mid April till the end of June and most parts become very hot ( except in alpine zone which experience mild summer ) with the average temperature ranging from 28 ° C ( 82 ° F ) to 32 ° C ( 90 ° F ) . Winter lasts from late November till mid March . Snowfall is generally common in alpine tracts that are above 2 @,@ 200 metres ( 7 @,@ 218 ft ) , especially those in the higher- and trans @-@ Himalayan regions . Near the coast the temperature hovers around 36 ° C ( 97 ° F ) , and the proximity of the sea increases the level of humidity . In southern India , the temperatures are higher on the east coast by a few degrees compared to the west coast .
