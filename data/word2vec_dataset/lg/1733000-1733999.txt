 " The Girl Is Mine " has been the subject of two plagiarism lawsuits . Both instances required Jackson to testify in court , and each lawsuit found in the favour of the singer and his record label . The first legal trial occurred in 1984 , with Fred Sanford claiming that Jackson had cut a tape of his song , " Please Love Me Now " . Jackson , however , insisted that he composed " The Girl Is Mine " . The $ 5 million copyright suit was closed after the jury of five men and a woman reached a verdict in the favour of Jackson . Their verdict was reached after a three @-@ day deliberation . Jackson was not a defendant in the trial but testified to maintain his credibility . James Klenk , Jackson 's attorney , praised the singer upon the jury 's verdict . " The man is a genius . He doesn 't need anyone else 's songs . His own words were the key . " During the court proceedings , Jackson revealed how he composes his songs . " I put them in a tape recorder and I orally sing them into the tape , and that 's how it happens . " One juror stated , " His presentation indicated that he was well able to develop his own songs . " 
 The song 's second plagiarism trial was in 1993 . Reynaud Jones and Robert Smith alleged that " The Girl Is Mine " , along with " Thriller " — written by Rod Temperton — and " We Are the World " , resembled their musical works . The pair added that they had been childhood neighbours of the Jackson family when they had resided in Gary , Indiana . Jackson , Lionel Richie — co @-@ writer of " We Are the World " — and Quincy Jones were named as the defendants . The plaintiffs asserted that Joseph Jackson had received a demo tape from them . From the tapes , the defendants were alleged to have stolen the three hit songs . Reynaud Jones also claimed that he had considered suing Jackson over " Billie Jean " . Jackson appeared in court via a taped testimony . Following the testimony , the nine @-@ member jury found Jackson to be the writer and composer of " The Girl Is Mine " in early 1994 . They also ruled that the defendants had not plagiarized " Thriller " or " We Are the World " .

 For Thriller 25 , an album celebrating Thriller 's 25th anniversary , Black Eyed Peas singer will.i.am remixed " The Girl Is Mine " . Entitled " The Girl Is Mine 2008 " , the remix featured an original solo demo of the song by Jackson , before he had recorded the duet with <unk> will.i.am added his own vocals and new verse . Though the remix sampled the demo , The Daily Telegraph alleged that McCartney was omitted because he and Jackson had fallen out over the latter 's purchase of Sony / ATV Music Publishing and the Beatles ' song catalogue in 1985 . Despite the allegation , the original version of " The Girl Is Mine " was included on the album , with McCartney 's vocals included . Upon its release in 2008 , the song reached number 12 in New Zealand . Peaking at 22 in France , the song charted within the Top 50 of Denmark , Sweden and Switzerland . The remix peaked at number 51 in Switzerland .

 " The Girl Is Mine 2008 " received mostly unfavourable reviews from music critics . Journalist Christopher Rees stated that will.i.am had " done a fantastic job of murdering a classic song " . Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted that will.i.am 's production was " dumb @-@ thug bluster " and criticized him for trying to hide the " goofy ' <unk> ' hook " — " the whole point of the song " . Music journalist Aidin Vaziri criticized the song , stating , " [ the ] Black Eyed Peas rapper completely erases Paul McCartney 's vocal track from the original duet to make room for himself spouting nonsense such as , ' I call her mommy and she call me papa / I 'm sorry Mike , but she loves the way I rock @-@ a . ' " Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic claimed that will.i.am had turned " The Girl Is Mine " into a " hapless dance number " . Kelefa Sanneh of Blender noted that " will.i.am contributes beats ( why ? ) and rhymes ( why , oh , why ? ) to " The Girl Is Mine 2008 " " . IGN 's Todd Gilchrist stated that will.i.am 's " The Girl Is Mine " remix was an offense . The offense was made even more " egregious " by the insertion of his own " atonal vocal presence " in place of McCartney 's . 
 Pitchfork Media added to the unfavourable reviews , stating of will.i.am , " He takes Macca off ' The Girl Is Mine ' but decides it can 't work without someone sounding like an idiot and steps manfully in himself . " The Times stated that whoever thought it was a good idea for will.i.am to participate in the song ought to be " locked in a windowless cell with nothing but those songs on a continuous loop " . PopMatters , however , praised Thriller 25 and the remix of " The Girl Is Mine " . They wrote , " Any album good enough to make you forgive ( although maybe not forget ) a song as bad as the Paul McCartney duet ' The Girl is Mine ' has got to be damn good . " They added that will.i.am had put a " breezy spin " on the track and that the song 's omission of McCartney did not suffer because of it .

 = Ferrari P4 / 5 by Pininfarina = 
 The Ferrari P4 / 5 ( officially known as the Ferrari P4 / 5 by Pininfarina ) is a one @-@ off sports car made by Italian sports car manufacturer Ferrari but redesigned by Pininfarina for film director and stock exchange magnate James Glickenhaus . 
 The car was initially an Enzo Ferrari but the owner James Glickenhaus preferred the styling of Ferrari 's 1960s race cars , the P Series . The project cost Glickenhaus US $ 4 million and was officially presented to the public in August 2006 at the Pebble Beach Concours d <unk> . Several websites were allowed to publish images of the clay model in July 2006 . 
 = = Development = = 
 In March 2005 Glickenhaus , stock exchange magnate and car collector , was approached by Pininfarina who asked if he was interested in commissioning a one @-@ off car . Andrea Pininfarina , grandson of the company ’ s founder later said " The Ferrari 612 Kappa and this P4 / 5 are the first . But we want to grow this business . " indicating that Pininfarina is interested in producing other unique cars . Glickenhaus replied that he would like a modern Ferrari P , and in June of that year he signed a contract with Pininfarina to produce the car including the price , approximately US $ 4 million though in an interview he said " I feel they gave me more than I expected " . Glickenhaus purchased the last unsold Enzo Ferrari and upon receipt of the car he took it to Pininfarina to be redesigned similar to his 1967 Ferrari 330 P3 / 4 chassis <unk> which he also delivered to Pininfarina . Pininfarina 's styling team leader , Ken Okuyama said that " Pininfarina wanted to stay away from retro design and move towards a more forward thinking supercar " as they were excited by the opportunity to build the car , not just design it . 
 Its design began in September 2005 with sketches by Jason <unk> moving through computer aided sculpture and stringent wind tunnel testing . More than 200 components were designed especially for the car . Most components , including the engine , drivetrain , are modified from the original Enzo Ferrari . The Vehicle Identification Number ( VIN ) is unchanged from the Enzo from which it was derived . The P4 / 5 was publicly revealed on August 18 , 2006 at the Pebble Beach Concours d <unk> and shown again at the Paris Motor Show in late September . 
 Upon seeing P 4 / 5 Luca di Montezemolo felt that the car deserved to be officially badged as a Ferrari and along with Andrea Pininfarina and James Glickenhaus agreed that its official name would be " Ferrari P 4 / 5 by Pininfarina " . Ted West wrote an article in Car and Driver about how this came to be " The Beast of Turin " . 
 On September 2009 , Glickenhaus announced his intention to race a new version of the P4 / 5 in the 2010 24 Hours Nürburgring . The car , called the P4 / 5 Competizione , would not be a conversion of his road car but instead an entirely new car with a Ferrari chassis , VIN and drivetrain . On May 2010 however , it was revealed that the Competizione would in fact be raced in 2011 , based on a 430 Scuderia . It would be built to FIA GT2 standards and raced by Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus in an Experimental Class under the direction of Paolo <unk> , former Head of Special Projects at Pininfarina . Ferrari completely distanced themselves from the P4 / 5 Competizione project in 2011 , refusing to sell the team parts for vital engine rebuilds between races . The car finished 39th in the 2011 24 Hours Nürburgring ( after bursting into flames ) and in 2012 won its class and finished 12th overall . 
 = = Specifications = = 
 The Ferrari P4 / 5 can accelerate from 0 @-@ 100 kilometres per hour ( 0 @-@ 62 mph ) in 3 @.@ 0 seconds ( 0 @.@ 14 seconds quicker than the Enzo ) . It has a top speed of 233 mph ( 375 km / h ) . The car has a frontal area of 1 @.@ 906 square metres ( 20 @.@ 52 sq ft ) and the sharp nose and smooth curves mean it has a drag coefficient of only 0 @.@ 34 . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The interior of the P4 / 5 was designed by Glickenhaus himself with an iPod nano stereo and a tablet PC which features not only GPS but a 3D model of the car as well as a complete parts list and manual for easy servicing . The P4 / 5 also sports improved air conditioning over the Enzo and a high @-@ strength alloy roll bar redesigned because the original was too thick and obstructed Glickenhaus ' view . The seats are custom built , Glickenhaus ' and his son 's bodies were scanned so Pininfarina could mould the seats for their comfort , accessibility and view of the road ( as with race cars ) . With a frame of carbon fibre composite , the seats are covered with a black mesh and red leather as selected by Glickenhaus ' daughter . Pininfarina rearranged the wiring of the car so as to make the car easier to service and 595 lb ( 270 kg ) lighter than the Enzo . 
 = = = Exterior = = = 
 The exterior of the car is made entirely of carbon fibre reinforced plastic and is similar in shape to the Ferrari 330 P4 as Glickenhaus requested , however it has been called a " rolling history of Ferrari @-@ racing @-@ DNA " sharing elements from several historic Ferrari vehicles , not just the 330 P4 . The rear window is similar to that of the Ferrari <unk> , the side vents are similar to the Ferrari 330 P3 and the nose is similar to that of the Ferrari 333 SP which improves cooling and the car 's frontal crash safety . The butterfly doors ( similar to those of the McLaren F1 ) are designed such that even at 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) there is no wind noise . The improved aerodynamics give the car greater downforce , yet less drag , than the Enzo , which makes the car more stable than the Enzo at high speeds . 
 = = = Powertrain = = = 
 The P4 / 5 has the same engine as the Enzo Ferrari it was built on , a 65 ° Ferrari <unk> B V12 . The 12 cylinders have a total capacity of 5 @,@ 998 cc ( 366 cu in ) , each with 4 valves . The redline rpm at 8200 and the torque of 485 lb · ft ( 658 N · m ) at 5500 rpm are both the same as the Enzo , but it produces marginally more power with 660 brake horsepower ( 492 kW ) at 7800 rpm . The P4 / 5 uses the 6 speed semi @-@ automatic transmission of the Enzo with black shifting paddles behind the wheel . It has two directional indicator buttons , one mounted on each side of the steering wheel . 
 = = = Chassis = = = 
 Much of the suspension was unchanged from the original Enzo , with the same push @-@ rod suspension at the front and rear , and the same Brembo carbon @-@ ceramic anti @-@ lock disc brakes with diameter of 340 millimetres ( 13 @.@ 4 in ) at the front and rear . The aluminium alloy wheels are 510 millimetres ( 20 in ) in diameter , the front tyres have codes of ZR 255 / 35 and the rear , ZR 335 / 30 . 
 = Rugby World Cup = 
 The Rugby World Cup is a men 's rugby union tournament contested every four years between the top international teams . The tournament was first held in 1987 , when the tournament was co @-@ hosted by New Zealand and Australia . New Zealand are the current champions , having defeated Australia in the final of the 2015 tournament in England . 
 The winners are awarded the William Webb Ellis Cup , named after William Webb Ellis , the Rugby School pupil who — according to a popular legend — invented rugby by picking up the ball during a football game . Four countries have won the trophy ; New Zealand have won it three times , two teams have won twice , Australia and South Africa , while England have won it once . 
 The tournament is administered by World Rugby , the sport 's international governing body . Sixteen teams were invited to participate in the inaugural tournament in 1987 , however since 1999 twenty teams have taken part . Japan will host the next event in 2019 . 
 = = Format = = 
 = = = Qualification = = = 
 Qualifying tournaments were introduced for the second tournament , where eight of the sixteen places were contested in a twenty @-@ four @-@ nation tournament . The inaugural World Cup in 1987 , did not involve any qualifying process ; instead , the 16 places were automatically filled by seven eligible International Rugby Football Board ( IRFB , now World Rugby ) member nations , and the rest by invitation . 
 In 2003 and 2007 , the qualifying format allowed for eight of the twenty available positions to be filled by automatic qualification , as the eight quarter finalists of the previous tournament enter its successor . The remaining twelve positions were filled by continental qualifying tournaments . Positions were filled by three teams from the Americas , one from Asia , one from Africa , three from Europe and two from Oceania . Another two places were allocated for repechage . The first repechage place was determined by a match between the runners @-@ up from the Africa and Europe qualifying tournaments , with that winner then playing the Americas runner @-@ up to determine the place . The second repechage position was determined between the runners @-@ up from the Asia and Oceania qualifiers . 
 The current format allows for 12 of the 20 available positions to be filled by automatic qualification , as the teams who finish third or better in the group ( pool ) stages of the previous tournament enter its successor ( where they will be seeded ) . The qualification system for the remaining eight places is region @-@ based , with a total eight teams allocated for Europe , five for Oceania , three for the Americas , two for Africa , and one for Asia . The last place is determined by an intercontinental play @-@ off . 
 = = = Tournament = = = 
 The 2015 tournament involved twenty nations competing over six weeks . There were two stages , a pool and a knockout . Nations were divided into four pools , A through to D , of five nations each . The teams were seeded before the start of the tournament , with the seedings taken from the World Rankings in December 2012 . The four highest @-@ ranked teams were drawn into pools A to D. The next four highest @-@ ranked teams were then drawn into pools A to D , followed by the next four . The remaining positions in each pool were filled by the qualifiers . 
 Nations play four pool games , playing their respective pool members once each . A bonus points system is used during pool play . If two or more teams are level on points , a system of criteria is used to determine the higher ranked ; the sixth and final criterion decides the higher rank through the official World Rankings . 
 The winner and runner @-@ up of each pool enter the knockout stage . The knockout stage consists of quarter- and semi @-@ finals , and then the final . The winner of each pool is placed against a runner @-@ up of a different pool in a quarter @-@ final . The winner of each quarter @-@ final goes on to the semi @-@ finals , and the respective winners proceed to the final . Losers of the semi @-@ finals contest for third place , called the ' Bronze Final ' . If a match in the knockout stages ends in a draw , the winner is determined through extra time . If that fails , the match goes into sudden death and the next team to score any points is the winner . As a last resort , a kicking competition is used . 
 = = History = = 
 Prior to the Rugby World Cup , there was no truly global rugby union competition , but there were a number of other tournaments . One of the oldest is the annual Six Nations Championship , which started in 1883 as the Home Nations Championship , a tournament between England , Ireland , Scotland and Wales . It expanded to the Five Nations in 1910 , when France joined the tournament . France did not participate from 1931 to 1939 , during which period it reverted to a Home Nations championship . In 2000 , Italy joined the competition , which became the Six Nations . 
 Rugby union was also played at the Summer Olympic Games , first appearing at the 1900 Paris games and subsequently at London in 1908 , Antwerp in 1920 , and Paris again in 1924 . France won the first gold medal , then Australasia , with the last two being won by the United States . However rugby union ceased to be on Olympic program after 1924 . 
 The idea of a Rugby World Cup had been suggested on numerous occasions going back to the 1950s , but met with opposition from most unions in the IRFB . The idea resurfaced several times in the early 1980s , with the Australian Rugby Union ( ARU ) in 1983 , and the New Zealand Rugby Union ( NZRU ) in 1984 independently proposing the establishment of a world cup . A proposal was again put to the IRFB in 1985 and this time successfully passed 10 – 6 . The delegates from Australia , France , New Zealand and South Africa all voted for the proposal , and the delegates from Ireland and Scotland against ; the English and Welsh delegates were split , with one from each country for and one against . 
 The inaugural tournament , jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand , was held in May and June 1987 , with sixteen nations taking part . New Zealand became the first ever champions , defeating France 29 – 9 in the final . The subsequent 1991 tournament was hosted by England , with matches played throughout Britain , Ireland and France . This tournament saw the introduction of a qualifying tournament ; eight places were allocated to the quarter @-@ finalists from 1987 , and the remaining eight decided by a thirty @-@ five nation qualifying tournament . Australia won the second tournament , defeating England 12 – 6 in the final . 
 In 1992 , eight years after their last official series , South Africa hosted New Zealand in a one @-@ off test match . The resumption of international rugby in South Africa came after the dismantling of the apartheid system , and was only done with permission of the African National Congress . With their return to test rugby , South Africa were selected to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup . After upsetting Australia in the opening match , South Africa continued to advance through the tournament until they met New Zealand in the final . After a tense final that went into extra time , South Africa emerged 15 – 12 winners , with then President Nelson Mandela , wearing a Springbok jersey , presenting the trophy to South Africa 's captain , Francois Pienaar . 
 The tournament in 1999 was hosted by Wales with matches also being held throughout the rest of the United Kingdom , Ireland and France . The tournament included a repechage system , alongside specific regional qualifying places , and an increase from sixteen to twenty participating nations . Australia claimed their second title , defeating France in the final . 
 The 2003 event was hosted by Australia , although it was originally intended to be held jointly with New Zealand . England emerged as champions defeating Australia in extra time . England 's win was unique in that it broke the southern hemisphere 's dominance in the event . Such was the celebration of England 's victory , that an estimated 750 @,@ 000 people gathered in central London to greet the team , making the day the largest sporting celebration of its kind ever in the United Kingdom . 
 The 2007 competition was hosted by France , with matches also being held in Wales and Scotland . South Africa claimed their second title by defeating defending champions England 15 – 6 . The 2011 tournament was awarded to New Zealand in November 2005 , ahead of bids from Japan and South Africa . The All Blacks reclaimed their place atop the rugby world with a narrow 8 – 7 win over France in the 2011 final . 
 In the 2015 edition of tournament , hosted by England , New Zealand once again won the final , this time against established rivals , Australia . In doing so , they became the first team in World Cup history to win three titles , as well as the first to successfully defend a title . It was also New Zealand 's first title victory on foreign soil . 
 = = Trophy = = 
 The Webb Ellis Cup is the prize presented to winners of the Rugby World Cup , named after William Webb Ellis . The trophy is also referred to simply as the Rugby World Cup . The trophy was chosen in 1987 as an appropriate cup for use in the competition , and was created in 1906 by Garrard 's Crown Jewellers . The trophy is restored after each game by fellow Royal Warrant holder Thomas Lyte . The words ' The International Rugby Football Board ' and ' The Webb Ellis Cup ' are engraved on the face of the cup . It stands thirty @-@ eight centimetres high and is silver gilded in gold , and supported by two cast scroll handles , one with the head of a satyr , and the other a head of a nymph . In Australia the trophy is colloquially known as " Bill " — a reference to William Webb Ellis . 
 = = Selection of hosts = = 
 Tournaments are organised by Rugby World Cup Ltd ( <unk> ) , which is itself owned by World Rugby . The selection of host is decided by a vote of World Rugby Council members . The voting procedure is managed by a team of independent auditors , and the voting kept secret . The allocation of a tournament to a host nation is now made five or six years prior to the commencement of the event , for example New Zealand were awarded the 2011 event in late 2005 . 
 The tournament has been hosted by multiple nations . For example , the 1987 tournament was co @-@ hosted by Australia and New Zealand . World Rugby requires that the hosts must have a venue with a capacity of at least 60 @,@ 000 spectators for the final . Host nations sometimes construct or upgrade stadia in preparation for the World Cup , such as Millennium Stadium – purpose built for the 1999 tournament – and Eden Park , upgraded for 2011 . The first country outside of the traditional rugby nations of SANZAR or the Six Nations to be awarded the hosting rights was Japan , who will host the 2019 tournament .

 = = = Media coverage = = = 
 Organizers of the 2015 tournament in England claim that the Rugby World Cup is the third largest sporting event in the World , behind only the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics . Although significant evidence suggests that is untrue . 
 Reports emanating from World Rugby and its business partners have frequently touted the tournament 's media growth , with cumulative worldwide television audiences of 300 million for the inaugural 1987 tournament , 1 @.@ 75 billion in 1991 , 2 @.@ 67 billion in 1995 , 3 billion in 1999 , 3 @.@ 5 billion in 2003 , and 4 billion in 2007 . 
 The 4 billion figure was widely dismissed as the global audience for television is estimated to be about 4 @.@ 2 billion . 
 However , independent reviews have called into question the methodology of those growth estimates , pointing to factual inconsistencies . The event 's supposed drawing power outside of a handful of rugby strongholds was also downplayed significantly , with an estimated 97 percent of the 33 million average audience produced by the 2007 final coming from Australasia , South Africa , the British Isles and France . Other sports have been accused of exaggerating their television reach over the years ; such claims are not exclusive to the Rugby World Cup . 
 While the event 's global popularity remains a matter of dispute , high interest in traditional rugby nations is well documented . The 2003 final , between Australia and England , became the most watched rugby union match in the history of Australian television .

 Twenty @-@ five nations have participated at the Rugby World Cup ( excluding qualifying tournaments ) . Of the eight tournaments that have been held , all but one have been won by a national team from the southern hemisphere . The southern hemisphere 's dominance has been broken only in 2003 , when England beat Australia in the final . 
 Thus far the only nations to host and win a tournament are New Zealand ( 1987 and 2011 ) and South Africa ( 1995 ) . The performance of other host nations includes England ( 1991 final hosts ) and Australia ( 2003 hosts ) finishing runners @-@ up .

 Amalthea ( / <unk> / am @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ ə ; Greek : <unk> ) is the third moon of Jupiter in order of distance from the planet . It was discovered on 9 September 1892 , by Edward Emerson Barnard and named after Amalthea , a nymph in Greek mythology . It is also known as Jupiter V. 
 Amalthea is in a close orbit around Jupiter and is within the outer edge of the Amalthea Gossamer Ring , which is formed from dust ejected from its surface . From its surface , Jupiter would appear 46 @.@ 5 degrees in diameter . Amalthea is the largest of the inner satellites of Jupiter . <unk> shaped and reddish in color , it is thought to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of other materials . Its surface features include large craters and ridges . 
 Amalthea was photographed in 1979 by the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft , and later , in more detail , by the Galileo orbiter in the 1990s .

 Amalthea is named after the nymph Amalthea from Greek mythology , who nursed the infant Zeus ( the Greek equivalent of Jupiter ) with goat 's milk . Its Roman numeral designation is Jupiter V. The name " Amalthea " was not formally adopted by the IAU until 1976 , although it had been in informal use for many decades . The name was initially suggested by Camille Flammarion . Before 1976 , Amalthea was most commonly known simply as Jupiter V. The adjectival form of the name is <unk> .

 Amalthea orbits Jupiter at a distance of 181 000 km ( 2 @.@ 54 Jupiter radii ) .

Such appreciably nonzero values of inclination and eccentricity , though still small , are unusual for an inner satellite and can be explained by the influence of the innermost Galilean satellite , Io : in the past Amalthea has passed through several mean @-@ motion resonances with Io that have excited its inclination and eccentricity ( in a mean @-@ motion resonance the ratio of orbital periods of two bodies is a rational number like m : n ) . 
 Amalthea 's orbit lies near the outer edge of the Amalthea Gossamer Ring , which is composed of the dust ejected from the satellite . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 The surface of Amalthea is very red ( that is , its reflectivity increases with the wavelength from the green to near @-@ infrared ) . The reddish color may be due to sulfur originating from Io or some other non @-@ ice material . Bright patches of less red tint appear on the major slopes of Amalthea , but the nature of this color is currently unknown . The surface of Amalthea is slightly brighter than surfaces of other inner satellites of Jupiter . There is also a substantial asymmetry between leading and trailing hemispheres : the leading hemisphere is 1 @.@ 3 times brighter than the trailing one . The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere , which excavate a bright material — presumably ice — from the interior of the moon . 
 Amalthea is irregularly shaped , with the best ellipsoidal approximation being 250 × 146 × 128 km . From this , Amalthea 's surface area is likely between 88 @,@ 000 and 170 @,@ 000 square kilometers , or somewhere near 130 @,@ 000 . Like all other inner moons of Jupiter it is tidally locked with the planet , the long axis pointing towards Jupiter at all times . Its surface is heavily scarred by craters , some of which are extremely large relative to the size of the moon : Pan , the largest crater , measures 100 km across and is at least 8 km deep . Another crater , Gaea , measures 80 km across and is likely twice as deep as Pan . Amalthea has several prominent bright spots , two of which are named . They are <unk> Facula and Ida Facula , with width reaching up to 25 km . They are located on the edge of ridges . 
 Amalthea 's irregular shape and large size led in the past to a conclusion that it is a fairly strong , rigid body , where it was argued that a body composed of ices or other weak materials would have been pulled into a more spherical shape by its own gravity . However , on 5 November 2002 , the Galileo orbiter made a targeted flyby that came within 160 km of Amalthea and the deflection of its orbit was used to compute the moon 's mass ( its volume had been calculated previously — to within 10 % or so — from a careful analysis of all extant images ) . In the end , Amalthea 's density was found to be as low as 0 @.@ 86 g / cm3 , so it must be either a relatively icy body or very porous " rubble pile " or , more likely , something in between . Recent measurements of infrared spectra from the Subaru telescope suggest that the moon indeed contains hydrous minerals ( or organic materials ) , indicating that it cannot have formed in its current position , since the hot primordial Jupiter would have melted it . It is therefore likely to have formed farther from the planet or to be a captured Solar System body . Unfortunately , no images were taken during this flyby ( Galileo 's cameras had been deactivated due to radiation damage in January 2002 ) , and the resolution of other available images is generally low . 
 Amalthea radiates slightly more heat than it receives from the Sun , which is probably due to the influence of Jovian heat flux ( < 9 kelvin ) , sunlight reflected from the planet ( < 5 K ) , and charged particle bombardment ( < 2 K ) . This is a trait shared with Io , although for very different reasons . 
 = = = Named geological features = = = 
 There are four named geological features on Amalthea : two craters and two <unk> ( bright spots ) . The <unk> are located on the edge of a ridge on the anti @-@ Jupiter side of Amalthea . 
 = = Relationship with Jupiter 's rings = = 
 Due to tidal force from Jupiter and Amalthea 's low density and irregular shape , the escape velocity at its surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter is no more than 1 m / s and dust can easily escape from it after , e.g. micrometeorite impacts ; this dust forms the Amalthea Gossamer Ring . 
 During its flyby of Amalthea , the Galileo orbiter 's star scanner detected nine flashes that appear to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea . Because they were sighted only from one location , their true distances could not be measured . These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium @-@ sized . Their origins are unknown , but they may be gravitationally captured into current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea . On the next and final orbit ( just an hour before destruction ) , Galileo detected one more such moonlet . However , this time Amalthea was on the other side of the planet , so it is probable that the particles form a ring around the planet near Amalthea 's orbit . 
 = = Views to and from Amalthea = = 
 From Jupiter 's surface — or rather , from just above its cloudtops — Amalthea would appear very bright , shining with a magnitude of − 4 @.@ 7 , similar to that of Venus from Earth . At only 8 arcminutes across , its disc would be barely discernible . Amalthea 's orbital period is only slightly longer than its parent planet 's day ( about 20 % in this case ) , which means it would cross Jupiter 's sky very slowly . The time between moonrise and moonset would be over 29 hours . 
 From the surface of Amalthea , Jupiter would look enormous : 46 degrees across , it would appear roughly 92 times larger than the full moon . Because Amalthea is in synchronous rotation , Jupiter would not appear to move , and would not be visible from one side of Amalthea . The Sun would disappear behind Jupiter 's bulk for an hour and a half each revolution , and Amalthea 's short rotation period gives it just under six hours of daylight . Though Jupiter would appear 900 times brighter than the full moon , its light would be spread over an area some 8500 times greater and it would not look as bright per surface unit . 
 = = Exploration = = 
 During 1979 , the unmanned Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 space probes made the first images of Amalthea , which resolved its surface . They also measured the visible and infrared spectra and surface temperature . Later , the Galileo orbiter completed the imaging of Amalthea 's surface . Amalthea provided the final satellite fly @-@ by for Galileo on 5 November 2002 , at a distance from the moon 's center of approximately 244 km ( 152 mi ) ( height about 160 – 170 km ) , permitting the moon 's mass to be accurately determined , while changing Galileo 's trajectory so that it would plunge into Jupiter in September 2003 , having finished its mission . In 2006 Amalthea 's orbit was refined by New Horizons spacecraft 's instruments .

 = Emery Molyneux = 
 Emery Molyneux ( / <unk> <unk> / EM @-@ ə @-@ ree MOL @-@ ə @-@ noh ; died June 1598 ) was an English Elizabethan maker of globes , mathematical instruments and ordnance . His terrestrial and celestial globes , first published in 1592 , were the first to be made in England and the first to be made by an Englishman . 
 Molyneux was known as a mathematician and maker of mathematical instruments such as compasses and hourglasses . He became acquainted with many prominent men of the day , including the writer Richard Hakluyt and the mathematicians Robert Hues and Edward Wright . He also knew the explorers Thomas Cavendish , Francis Drake , Walter Raleigh and John Davis . Davis probably introduced Molyneux to his own patron , the London merchant William Sanderson , who largely financed the construction of the globes . When completed , the globes were presented to Elizabeth I. Larger globes were acquired by royalty , noblemen and academic institutions , while smaller ones were purchased as practical navigation aids for sailors and students . The globes were the first to be made in such a way that they were unaffected by the humidity at sea , and they came into general use on ships . 
 Molyneux emigrated to Amsterdam with his wife in 1596 or 1597 . He succeeded in interesting the States @-@ General , the parliament of the United Provinces , in a cannon he had invented , but he died suddenly in June 1598 , apparently in poverty . The globe @-@ making industry in England died with him . 
 Only six of his globes are believed still to be in existence . Three are in England , of which one pair consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe is owned by Middle Temple and displayed in its library , while a terrestrial globe is at Petworth House in Petworth , West Sussex . 
 = = Globe @-@ maker = = 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 Emery Molyneux is regarded as the maker of the first terrestrial and celestial globes in England and as the first English globe @-@ maker . Little is known about the man himself . <unk> Ubaldini , an Italian <unk> , illuminator and ambassador who was acquainted with him , said he was " of obscure and humble family background " . It seems likely that he was the " Emery <unk> " who was presented to the Worshipful Company of Stationers as the apprentice of one William Cooke in October 1557 . By the 1580s he had a workshop in Lambeth , on the south bank of the Thames , and enjoyed a reputation as a mathematician and maker of mathematical instruments . Richard <unk> , in his book The Pathway to Perfect <unk> ( 1605 ) , mentioned that Molyneux had been a skilful maker of compasses and hourglasses . 
 Through his trade , Molyneux was known to the explorers Thomas Cavendish , John Davis , Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh , the writer Richard Hakluyt , and the mathematicians Robert Hues and Edward Wright . The construction of globes by Molyneux appears to have been suggested by Davis to his patron William Sanderson , a London merchant who has been described as " one of the most munificent and patriotic of merchant @-@ princes of London in the days of Elizabeth I " . Sanderson readily agreed to bear the manufacturing costs , and financed initial production of the globes with a capital investment of £ 1 @,@ 000 ( almost £ 160 @,@ 000 as of 2007 ) . 
 = = = = Terrestrial globes = = = = 
 In making his terrestrial globes , Molyneux examined <unk> ( instructions for directions at sea ) and pilots ( navigational handbooks ) . He is known to have given a <unk> for Brazil and the West Indies to Thomas Harriot in 1590 . He also received advice and assistance from navigators and mathematicians . It is likely , for instance , that Sir Walter Raleigh advised him on a legend in Spanish about the Solomon Islands that appeared on the terrestrial globe . Raleigh came by the information from Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa , a Galician explorer sent by King Philip II of Spain to fortify the Strait of Magellan after Francis Drake had passed through it . In 1584 , the Spaniard was Raleigh 's guest in London for a few weeks , after being captured by Raleigh on a journey to Europe . 
 Molyneux accompanied Francis Drake on his 1577 – 1580 circumnavigation of the world ; as Ubaldini reported , " [ h ] e himself has been in those seas and on those coasts in the service of the same Drake " . A legend in Latin on the terrestrial globe , explaining why Molyneux had left out the polar lands and corrected the distance across the Atlantic Ocean between The Lizard and Cape Race in Newfoundland , concluded : 
 Quod <unk> [ m ] <unk> tu [ m ] ex <unk> <unk> primo , tum <unk> ex <unk> illa sub <unk> . Fran . <unk> ad <unk> Occident , expeditione , in qua non modo <unk> <unk> [ e ] <unk> [ m ] <unk> , sed <unk> mea <unk> [ m ] que , vel <unk> [ n ] ta vel <unk> ad <unk> [ m ] hoc qui [ n ] <unk> [ n ] io pr [ a ] <unk> <unk> , ad hujus <unk> <unk> [ m ] co [ m ] <unk> ... [ I have been able to do this both in the first place from my own voyages and secondly from that successful expedition to the West Indies under the most illustrious Francis Drake : in which expedition I have put together not only all the best delineations of others , but everything my own humble knowledge or experience has been able to furnish in the last five years to the perfecting of this work . ] 
 On the terrestrial globe , tracks of the voyages of Francis Drake and Thomas Cavendish around the world are marked by red and blue lines respectively . These lines were applied when the globe was first made . They are mentioned in a description of Molyneux 's globes in Blundeville His Exercises ( 1594 ) by Thomas Blundeville , a country gentleman who was an enthusiastic student of astronomy and navigation . Thomas Cavendish appears to have helped Molyneux with his globes , and it is possible that Molyneux accompanied him on his 1587 voyage around the world , which returned to England on 9 September 1588 . In 1889 , Sir Clements Markham , an English explorer , author and geographer , pointed out that a Latin legend on the terrestrial globe , placed off the Patagonian coast , states : " Thomas <unk> 18 Dec. 1587 <unk> terra sub nostris <unk> primum <unk> sub <unk> 47 cujus seu <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ex parte <unk> sunt <unk> et <unk> <unk> " . However , Helen Wallis , former Map Curator of the British Library , observed in 1951 that this was unlikely , because Molyneux incorrectly plotted Cavendish 's course in Maritime Southeast Asia . She suggested , however , that another legend on the globe may indicate that he sailed on at least one if not all of John Davis 's voyages . 
 The mathematician and cartographer Edward Wright assisted Molyneux in plotting coastlines on the terrestrial globe and translated some of the legends into Latin . On 10 April 1591 , the astrologer and physician Simon Forman visited Molyneux 's workshop and taught him how to find longitude . It appears that after Molyneux had prepared the manuscript <unk> ( the flat map segments attached to the globes ) , he had them printed by the celebrated Flemish engraver and cartographer Jodocus Hondius , who lived in London between 1584 and 1593 to escape religious difficulties in Flanders . This can be deduced from the phrase " Iodocus Hon : / <unk> <unk> sc . / 1592 " that appears on the celestial globe along with Sanderson 's coat of arms and a dedication to the Queen dated 1592 . Molyneux 's own name is recorded on the Middle Temple terrestrial globe in the phrase " <unk> <unk> <unk> . ' / sumptibus Gulielmi — / Sandersoni <unk> : / sis <unk> " ( " Emery Molyneux of England , at the expense of William Sanderson of London , described this " ) . 
 = = = = Celestial globes = = = = 
 Molyneux 's celestial globe was virtually a copy of Gerardus Mercator 's globe of 1551 , which itself was based on a globe of 1537 by Gemma <unk> that Mercator had helped to construct . To the constellations featured on Mercator 's globe , Molyneux added the Southern Cross and Southern Triangle , though somewhat to the west of their true positions . His source appears to have been Andrea <unk> 's diagram of the Antarctic sky published in 1550 . 
 Molyneux 's globes were the first to be constructed in such a way that they were unaffected by humidity at sea . They were made of flour @-@ paste , an unusual material for the time . Simon Forman remarked that Molyneux 's moulding or casting process was " the only way to caste [ anything ] whatsoever in <unk> forme ... and yt is the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of all wayes ... and this was the wai that <unk> did use to cast <unk> [ flour ] in the verie forme " . 
 = = = Publication = = = 
 In 1589 , Richard Hakluyt announced the forthcoming publication of Molyneux 's terrestrial globe at the end of the preface to The Principall Navigations , Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation . Referring to the map that was inserted into the volume — a reproduction of the " <unk> Orbis Terrarum " engraved by Franciscus Hogenberg for Abraham Ortelius ' Theatrum Orbis Terrarum ( 1570 ) — he wrote : 
 I have contented myselfe with inserting into the worke one of the best generall <unk> of the world onely , <unk> the <unk> out of a very large and most exact <unk> globe , collected and reformed according to the newest , <unk> , and latest discoveries , both Spanish , Portugall and English , composed by Mr. <unk> Molineux of Lambeth , a rare Gentleman in his profession , being <unk> for divers <unk> , greatly supported by the purse and <unk> of the <unk> merchant M. William Sanderson . 
 Ubaldini reported Molyneux 's progress in manufacturing the globes to the Duke of Milan . He was in attendance when Molyneux presented a pair of manuscript globes to Elizabeth I at Greenwich in July 1591 . Ubaldini noted that " he gave her the globe to let her see at a glance how much of the world she could control by means of her naval forces " . According to Wallis , the printed globes , which at 2 feet 1 inch ( 0 @.@ 64 m ) in diameter were then the largest ever made , were published after some delay in late 1592 or early 1593 . Sanderson arranged entertainments at his home in Newington Butts to mark the presentation of these globes to the Queen . His son William later reported the Queen 's words on accepting the terrestrial globe : " The whole earth , a present for a Prince ... " ; and on accepting the celestial globe , she said : " Thou hast presented me with the Heavens also : God guide me , to Govern my part of the one , that I may enjoy but a mansion place in this other . " Elizabeth I saw globes and armillary spheres as symbols of her empire and spiritual mission on earth . The royal coat of arms was emblazoned across North America on the terrestrial globe . 
 Several treatises were published to describe the Molyneux globes and provide guides on their use . Molyneux himself wrote a treatise , now lost , entitled The Globes Celestial and Terrestrial Set Forth in Plano , which Sanderson published in 1592 . In the same year , Thomas Hood , a London @-@ based mathematics lecturer who had written a 1590 work on the use of celestial globes , published The Vse of Both the Globes , Celestiall and Terrestriall . This was followed in 1594 by two works , one of which was Blundeville 's book . The other , Tractatus de Globis et <unk> Usu ( Treatise on Globes and their Use ) , was published by the mathematician Robert Hues . This work went into at least 13 printings and was translated from Latin into Dutch , English and French . In 1599 , Edward Wright published Certaine Errors in Navigation , which included commentary on the use of the terrestrial and celestial globes developed by Molyneux . 
 According to Markham , " the appearance of the globes naturally created a great sensation , and much interest was taken in appliances which were equally useful to the student and to the practical navigator . " The largest and most prestigious globes were priced at up to £ 20 each : these were purchased by royalty , noblemen and academic institutions . Among the purchasers were Thomas Bodley and the Warden of All Souls College , for their libraries in Oxford . William Sanderson presented the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge with a pair each . The public preacher Thomas Laughton made an inaugural gift of a Molyneux globe to the Shrewsbury School library . Smaller globes were also made , though no examples have survived . Sanderson is known to have presented one of these to Robert Cecil in 1595 , together with Hues ' " Latin booke that <unk> the use of my great globes " . Intended as practical navigation aids , they cost as little as £ 2 . 
 The globes provided navigators and students with methods for finding the place of the sun , latitude , course , distance , amplitudes , <unk> , time and declination . They proved such a boon to navigation that they came into widespread use on ships . In the dedication of his 1595 book The Seamans Secrets to the Lord High Admiral , Charles Howard , the 1st Earl of Nottingham , navigator John Davis spoke of " the mechanical practices drawn from the Arts of <unk> , [ in which ] our Country doth yield men of principal excellency " , and he noted " Mr Emery <unk> for the exquisite making of Globes bodies " .

 In the 1590s , Molyneux sought Elizabeth I 's patronage for the production of a cannon , which he described as his " new invention , of shot and artillery , to be used principally in naval warfare : protection of ports and harbours , a new shot to discharge a thousand musket shot ; with wildfire not to be quenched " . In March 1593 , Molyneux was issued with a royal warrant . Two years later , the merchant Robert Parkes purchased coal , saltpetre , pitch , oils and waxes for him , possibly for the cannon . On 4 November 1596 the Privy Council urged the Lord Admiral " to speak to Molyneux , Bussy and the two <unk> about their offensive engines " as part of measures to defend England 's south coast . It appears the request was ignored . On 27 September 1594 , the Queen granted Molyneux a gift of £ 200 and an annuity of £ 50 . He chose to surrender the latter when , some time between March or April 1596 and 4 June 1597 , he and his wife Anne emigrated to Amsterdam , Holland . Wallis has conjectured that he took with him the printing plates for the globes and sold them to Hondius , who had returned to Amsterdam in 1593 . 
 Why Molyneux left England for Holland is unclear . The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography suggests it was to be able to personally distribute his globes to European princes , since Amsterdam was then quickly establishing itself as the centre of <unk> and map @-@ making . However , this could not have been his intention if he had sold the globes ' plates to Hondius . It is possible that he had decided to concentrate on manufacturing ordnance . On 26 January 1598 , the States @-@ General , the parliament of the United Provinces , showed interest in Molyneux 's cannon and granted him a 12 @-@ year privilege on an invention . On 6 June he lodged a second application , but he died in Amsterdam almost immediately afterwards . His wife was granted administration of his estate in England later that month . It seems that Molyneux died in poverty , because Anne was granted a Dutch compassionate pension of 50 florins on 9 April 1599 . Molyneux apparently had no surviving family , and the English globe @-@ making industry died with him . No other globes appear to have been manufactured in England until the appearance in the 1670s of globes by Robert Morden and William Berry , and by Joseph Moxon . However , over 40 years after Molyneux 's death , William Sanderson the younger wrote that his globes were " yet in being , great and small ones , Celestiall and Terrestriall , in both our Universities and severall Libraries ( here , and beyond Seas ) " .

 In the second volume of the greatly expanded version of his book The Principal Navigations , Voiages , Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation ( 1599 ) , Hakluyt published what is known today as the Wright – Molyneux Map . Created by Edward Wright and based on Molyneux 's terrestrial globe , it was the first map to use Wright 's improvements on Mercator 's projection . 
 Having , it is believed , purchased the plates of Molyneux 's globes , Jodocus Hondius was granted a ten @-@ year privilege on 1 April 1597 to make and publish a terrestrial globe . In that year , he produced in Amsterdam a Dutch translation of Hues ' Tractatus de Globis . On 31 October 1598 , despite a legal challenge by rival globe @-@ maker Jacob van <unk> , Hondius obtained another privilege for ten years . He duly published globes in 1600 and 1601 , and his sons Henricus and Jodocus published a pair in 1613 . Hondius also published a world map in 1608 on the Mercator projection . Its reliance on the Molyneux globe is shown by a number of legends , names and outlines which must have been copied directly from it . 
 In his globes of 1612 , van <unk> incorporated the improvements made by Hondius the Elder to Molyneux 's globe . It is believed that the Hondius globes also spurred Willem Blaeu to start constructing his large globes in 1616 , which were published in 1622 . Molyneux 's globes therefore may have indirectly influenced the evolution of Dutch globe @-@ making . 
 = = = Culture = = = 
 The appearance of Molyneux 's globes had a significant influence on the culture of his time . In Shakespeare 's The Comedy of Errors , written between 1592 and 1594 , one of the protagonists , <unk> of Syracuse , compares a kitchen maid to a terrestrial globe : " No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip : she is spherical , like a globe ; I could find out countries in her . " The jest gained its point from the publication of the globes ; Shakespeare may even have seen them himself . Elizabethan dramatist Thomas Dekker wrote in one of his plays published in The Gull 's Horn @-@ book ( 1609 ) : 
 What an excellent workman , therefore , were he that could cast the globe of it into a new mould . And not to make it look like Molyneux his globe , with a round face sleeked and washed over with white of eggs , but have it in plano as it was at first , with all the ancient circles , lines , parallels and figures . 
 It has been suggested that the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , the playing company that Shakespeare worked for as an actor and playwright for most of his career , named their playing space the Globe Theatre , built in 1599 , as a response to the growing enthusiasm for terrestrial and celestial globes stimulated by those of Molyneux . 
 In Twelfth Night ( 1600 – 1601 ) , Shakespeare alluded to the Wright – Molyneux Map when Maria says of Malvolio : " He does smile his face into more lynes , than is in the new Mappe , with the augmentation of the Indies . "

 Only six Molyneux globes are known to exist today , two terrestrial globes and four celestial globes . Three celestial globes are in Germany , one each in Zerbst , Nuremberg ( at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum ( German National Museum ) ) and Kassel ( Hessisches Landesmuseum ( Hesse Museum ) , Kassel ) . The Hessisches Landesmuseum once had a 1592 terrestrial globe , but it is believed to have been destroyed during World War II . Three globes remain in England : one pair , consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe , is owned by Middle Temple in London and displayed in its library , while a terrestrial globe is at Petworth House in Petworth , West Sussex . 
 = = = Petworth House globe = = = 
 A terrestrial globe was discovered in Lord Leconfield 's library at Petworth House in Petworth , West Sussex , in July 1949 . According to the tradition of the Wyndham family , who are descended from Henry Percy , the 9th Earl of Northumberland , the globe belonged to Sir Walter Raleigh , who gave it to Northumberland when they were imprisoned together in the Tower of London . Northumberland , known as the " Wizard Earl " for his interest in scientific and alchemical experiments and his library , was suspected of being involved in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 because his relative Thomas Percy was among the conspirators . James I imprisoned Raleigh in the Tower for his supposed involvement in the Main Plot . Although the theory is supported by circumstantial evidence , a number of entries in Northumberland 's accounts relating to the mending of globes , one dating back to 1596 , suggest that the Molyneux globe may have belonged to him from the beginning and was not Raleigh 's . The globe , however , almost certainly spent many years in the Tower before its transfer to Petworth House , where Northumberland was confined upon his release in 1621 . 
 The Petworth House globe , now in the North Gallery , is the only Molyneux terrestrial globe preserved in its original 1592 state . One of Molyneux 's " great globes " , measuring 2 feet 1 inch ( 0 @.@ 64 m ) in diameter , it was reported in 1952 to be in poor condition despite restoration by the British Museum the previous year . The northern hemisphere was darkened by dirt and badly rubbed in places , to the extent that it was hard to read . Parts of it , and large sections of the southern hemisphere , are missing altogether . The restoration work revealed that the globe is weighted with sand and made from layers of small pieces of paper overlaid with a coat of plaster about 1 ⁄ 8 inch ( 3 mm ) thick . On top of this is another layer of paper over which the <unk> are pasted . The globe retains its wooden horizon circle and brass meridian ring , but its hour circle and index are missing . Further restoration took place between 1995 and 1997 . The globe was exhibited at the Royal Geographical Society in 1951 and 1952 . 
 = = = Middle Temple globes = = = 
 A bill in the accounts of 11 April 1717 for " repairing the globes in the library " is the earliest reference to the Middle Temple 's ownership of the Molyneux terrestrial and celestial globes . Markham 's view was that Robert Ashley ( 1565 – 1641 ) , a barrister of the Middle Temple who was also an ardent geographer , was likely to have left the globes to the Inn in his will , together with his books . Ashley 's books formed the nucleus of the Inn 's original library and included copies of the second edition of Hues ' Tractatus de Globis and other works on cosmography . On the other hand , Wallis has said that Markham 's view is not supported by any available evidence and the globes are not mentioned in the will . She believes that they were probably acquired by Middle Temple on their publication in 1603 . 
 The celestial globe is dated 1592 , but the terrestrial globe bears the year 1603 and is the only example of its kind . Wallis has surmised that the globes were made by Hondius in Amsterdam in 1603 for a purchaser in England , perhaps the Middle Temple itself . The celestial globe was made from the original 1592 printing plates , while the terrestrial globe was produced using revised plates redated to 1603 . The Middle Temple terrestrial globe differs from the Petworth House globe of 1592 by incorporating Raleigh 's discoveries in Guiana and adding new place @-@ names in Brazil , Peru and Africa , as well as an island marked " Corea " off the coast of China . The most extensive revision altered the Northeast Passage to take account of discoveries made on Willem Barentsz 's third voyage to Novaya Zemlya in 1596 . It appears that the revisions to the original plates of Molyneux 's globe were completed by 1597 , because no discoveries after that year are included . It is possible that Molyneux helped Hondius to update the plates in 1596 or 1597 . For instance , if Hondius had obtained a copy of Raleigh 's map of Guiana , Molyneux was the most likely source . Unlike the Petworth House globe , the Middle Temple globes are heavily varnished . The varnish could have been first applied as early as 1818 when the globes were repaired by J. and W. Newton ; they were certainly varnished by Messrs. Holland Hannen & Cubitts , Ltd. during maintenance work in 1930 . 
 At the start of World War II , the globes were sent to Beaconsfield and stored with part of the Wallace Collection at Hall Barn in the care of Lady Burnham . They were brought back to London in 1945 and were at one stage kept in the King 's Library on loan to the British Museum . The globes were installed in their present position in the Middle Temple Library when the current library building opened in 1958 . In 2003 , they were loaned to the National Maritime Museum for an exhibition commemorating the life of Elizabeth I. 
 In 2004 , Middle Temple proposed selling the Molyneux globes , valued at over £ 1 million , to create a scholarship fund for the education and training of needy would @-@ be barristers . Its members eventually decided by a large majority against such a move . There was also a general feeling that the globes should be made more accessible to those wishing to see them . 
 The Middle Temple 's Molyneux globes are the subject of a book @-@ length project , The Molyneux Globes : Mathematical Practice and Theory , by Dr. Lesley B. Cormack , Professor and Chair of the Department of History and Classics of the Faculty of Arts , University of Alberta . The project examines the community of mathematicians , natural philosophers , instrument @-@ makers , and gentlemen @-@ virtuosi that developed around the creation of the Molyneux globes , particularly the histories of four men who wrote treatises about the globes and the larger mathematical community . 
 = = = Hessisches Landesmuseum globe = = = 
 The Molyneux globes at the Hessisches Landesmuseum , Kassel , were inherited from the collection of William IV ( William the Wise ) , the Landgrave of Hesse @-@ Kassel ( or Hesse @-@ Cassel ) , a pioneer of astronomical research . William himself died in 1592 , so it has been surmised that his son and successor , Maurice , purchased the globes for the collection . They were first mentioned in 1765 in the index of the Mathematische Kammer ( Mathematics Chamber ) of the <unk> <unk> ( Princely Art Gallery ) in Kassel , during the reign of Landgrave Frederick III . Only a celestial globe survives today ; it is believed that the terrestrial globe was destroyed during World War II .

 = Jet Moto ( video game ) = 
 Jet Moto ( known as Jet Rider in Europe ) is a 1996 racing video game developed by SingleTrac and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation video game console and PC . The PlayStation version was released in North America on October 31 , 1996 , in Europe in February 1997 , and Japan on August 7 , 1997 . The PC version was released on November 30 , 1997 . On February 4 , 2007 Jet Moto was made available for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network . Developers chose fictional hovering bikes instead of wheeled motorcycles initially to resolve performance concerns . Other performance concerns led the team to develop two different physics systems — one for the player , and one for the 19 computer racers . 
 Gameplay in Jet Moto revolves around the use of hoverbikes to traverse a race course , similar to modern day motorcross , but with the added ability to traverse water . Reviews for the game were mixed , with the PC version holding 75 % and the PlayStation version 78 @.@ 9 % at gaming aggregator GameRankings . Reviewers felt the game had solid gameplay , but criticized its high difficulty . Jet Moto 's popularity would earn it a spot in the PlayStation Greatest Hits in August 1998 , and it went on to gain two additional sequels , Jet Moto 2 and Jet Moto 3 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Jet Moto differs from that of a traditional racing game with cars or motorcycles . Players are introduced to the fictional sport of Jet Moto . The bikes , known as jet motos , are hovercraft which can traverse both land and water . The bikes race in groups of twenty in the game 's equivalent of motorcross . Characters are split into teams , and bikes are adorned with logos of products such as Mountain Dew , Butterfinger and K2 Sports similar to real @-@ life sponsored racing . 
 In Jet Moto players control hoverbikes in a fictional motor sport . Players race three laps on a given course and earn series points based on their placement at the end of the race . Players can choose to race a single race , a season of races , or a custom season . Players can also unlock additional tracks and a stunt mode by doing well in season competitions . 
 Courses range from beaches with debris @-@ littered water to swamps and ice @-@ covered mountains . The game has its variant of the traditional race track , but also introduces a new course type known as a Suicide course . Instead of being a continuous loop , these tracks have checkpoints at either end of the course , and the starting grid in the center . Riders race to one end , then turn around to head for the other checkpoint , repeating the process until all laps are complete . This provides a new gameplay dynamic as often the player must navigate oncoming traffic . 
 Jet Moto also utilizes a magnetic grappling system . Pressing the assigned button near a red energy pole creates a magnetic attraction between the player 's bike and the pole , allowing riders to traverse tight turns and clear large chasms otherwise be impossible . In addition to the grapple system players are given four boosts per lap , which provide a temporary burst of speed . The PlayStation version of the game allows for two player splitscreen multiplayer , however no AI racers are present , which limits the competitors to two . A cheat code would allow two human players to race with the entire field . The PC version allows for fourteen players over an IPX network , Internet TCP / IP and modem @-@ to @-@ modem connections . 
 = = Development = = 
 Jet Moto was conceived as a " science fiction motorcross . " The developers chose to create jet motos instead of wheeled motorcycles due to concerns over polygon limitations . Travis Hilton , one of the programmers for the game designed Jet Moto 's physics engine . Due to hardware limitations of the PlayStation , only the player used this physics system . Programmer Jay <unk> was tasked with developing a simpler physics system to handle the nineteen AI riders . During development a set of courses set in a stadium were dropped as the developers felt it did not fit the theme of the game . 
 Developers originally intended for players to be permanently out of a race when falling far off a track , however they came to realize that it was not fun for players " to be forced to go slow or suffer an instant defeat . " An attempt was made to give three " strikes " to a rider . Once the rider fell for the third time they were out of the race . However once implemented developers noticed that the number of racers remaining at the end of the race was too random to be deemed any fun . In the end the decision was made to simply respawn the character on the track . The PC version was ported in large part by John Olsen , who worked on the port as his first task at SingleTrac . The PC version also features 3Dfx hardware acceleration , which allows for higher resolution gameplay and visual enhancements such as reflective water . Axiom Design created the user interface shell for the game , which has a comic book @-@ inspired feel . The music for Jet Moto was produced by Big Idea Music Productions . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Jet Moto received varied reviews among critics , with the PC version averaging 75 % and the PlayStation version averaging 78 @.@ 9 % at gaming aggregator GameRankings . Due to the game 's popularity it was added Sony 's budget line known as PlayStation Greatest Hits in August 1998 . 
 Several reviewers praised the overall gameplay of Jet Moto . Chris Roper of IGN called it one of the best racing games available for the PlayStation . In its PlayStation 3 Retro Roundup , IGN pointed out the game 's direct competitors at the time , Wave Race 64 and the Wipeout series , then stated Jet Moto was " still a pretty fun experience more than 10 years after its original release . " Electric Playground 's Victor Lucas praised the design of the jet moto bikes , stating the design was imaginative and vibrant . Several reviewers also praised the soundtrack to the game . Mark Cooke of Game Revolution called the Dick Dale @-@ esque music which seemed reminiscent of spy films such as the James Bond theme . The surf guitar was a strong point for Victor Lucas of Electric Playground , who cited it as one of the best video game soundtracks of 1996 . GameSpot reviewer Shane Mooney also praised the energy of the soundtrack . 
 Reviewers felt the game had an extremely high degree of difficulty . GamePro 's reviewer cited overly skilled AI racers and poor collision detections as reasons to avoid Jet Moto . Several reviewers cited the games graphics as a down point in the game , although GameSpot 's review of the PC port praised the 3Dfx support . Electric Playground also compared it to Wave Race 64 , but called the game " light on the great graphics " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Jet Moto 's popularity would spawn two additional sequels , Jet Moto 2 , also developed by SingleTrac , and Jet Moto 3 , developed by Pacific Coast Power & Light . Two other titles were cancelled during their development . Pacific Coast Power & Light was also developing Jet Moto 2124 for the PlayStation , set over a century after the first three games , however the game was cancelled when Jet Moto 3 showed poor sales . Jet Moto : <unk> , developed by RedZone Interactive , was also cancelled . <unk> would have been the first title in the series to appear on the PlayStation 2 . 
 Present @-@ day <unk> for video game sequels have often included Jet Moto . 1UP.com listed a fourth Jet Moto in their " Sequels We Want , and the Formulas They Need " feature , stating that Jet Moto " symbolized everything that made the original PlayStation cooler than anything else at the time " . IGN felt similarly , listing Jet Moto in their " Dirty Dozen : Revival of the Fittest " feature , calling the game " a novel racer with enough staying power to make it an instant hit " . 
 = Henry Burrell ( admiral ) = 
 Vice Admiral Sir Henry Mackay Burrell , KBE , CB ( 13 August 1904 – 9 February 1988 ) was a senior commander in the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . He served as Chief of the Naval Staff ( CNS ) from 1959 to 1962 . Born in the Blue Mountains , Burrell entered the Royal Australian Naval College in 1918 as a thirteen @-@ year @-@ old cadet . His first posting at sea was aboard the cruiser HMAS Sydney . During the 1920s and 1930s , Burrell served for several years on exchange with the Royal Navy , specialising as a navigator . Following the outbreak of World War II , he filled a key liaison post with the US Navy , and later saw action as commander of the destroyer HMAS Norman , earning a mention in despatches . 
 Promoted captain in 1946 , Burrell played a major role in the formation of the RAN 's Fleet Air Arm , before commanding the flagship HMAS Australia in 1948 – 49 . He captained the light aircraft carrier HMAS Vengeance in 1953 – 54 , and was twice Flag Officer of the Australian Fleet , in 1955 – 56 and 1958 . Burrell was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1955 and a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1959 . As CNS , he began a major program of acquisitions for the Navy , including new helicopters , minesweepers , submarines and guided @-@ missile destroyers . He also acted to reverse a plan by the government of the day to dismantle the Fleet Air Arm . Knighted in 1960 , Burrell retired to his farm near Canberra in 1962 and published his memoirs , Mermaids Do Exist , in 1986 . He died two years later , aged eighty @-@ three . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Henry Mackay Burrell was born at Wentworth Falls , in the Blue Mountains district of New South Wales . He was the third child and only son of schoolteacher Thomas Burrell and his wife Eliza . Henry 's father , who had emigrated from England , joined the Australian Imperial Force at the age of fifty @-@ five during World War I , seeing active service in Egypt . His grandfather and great @-@ grandfather had served in the Royal Navy . Henry attended Parramatta High School before entering the Royal Australian Naval College , Jervis Bay , on 1 January 1918 , at the age of thirteen . A keen sportsman , he competed in rugby union , tennis and hockey , winning colours for hockey . Burrell graduated from the college in 1921 and became a midshipman the next year . He went to sea first aboard the light cruiser HMAS Sydney and then the destroyer HMAS Stalwart . Posted to the United Kingdom for further training in 1924 , he served on the light cruiser HMS Caledon and the battleship HMS Malaya . In April 1925 , he was promoted to sub @-@ lieutenant , rising to lieutenant by July 1926 . 
 After attending a Royal Navy course in 1930 , Burrell became a specialist navigator , and saw service aboard the minesweeper HMS Pangbourne , destroyers HMAS Tattoo and Stuart , and cruiser HMAS Brisbane . He married Margaret MacKay at Scots ' Church , Melbourne , on 27 December 1933 . Burrell was promoted to lieutenant commander in July 1934 , and graduated from an advanced navigation course the following year . 
 Burrell served on exchange with the Royal Navy as navigator aboard the cruisers HMS Coventry and HMS Devonshire , the latter during her tour of duty in the Spanish Civil War . Described as being " egalitarian " and " approachable " , his familiarity with ratings earned him the criticism of Devonshire 's captain ; Burrell however believed that a close relationship between officers and men was necessary for the smooth running of a ship . After completing the Royal Navy 's staff course in 1938 , he returned to Australia and was appointed staff officer ( operations ) at the Navy Office , Melbourne , in March 1939 . It was Burrell 's first shore @-@ based position , and he spent the next four months bringing naval sections of the War Book ( preparations for war ) up to date . 
 = = World War II = = 
 Burrell was still based at the Navy Office when World War II broke out in September 1939 . A reorganisation of the headquarters in May 1940 saw him promoted to commander and given the new role of Director of Operations , overseeing troop convoys and their air cover , local defence , and staffing issues . Burrell 's " full knowledge of Australian naval plans and resources " led to Prime Minister Robert Menzies personally nominating him to participate in staff talks with representatives of the Royal Navy and US Navy in October . Soon after , he was posted as the first Australian naval attaché to Washington , D.C. , in an effort to improve communications with the US in light of the threat from Japan . Burrell was credited with helping to foster closer cooperation between the two navies in the Pacific region . He also warned the Australian government that Britain and the US would adopt a " Germany @-@ first " strategy in the event of war with Japan , and that the US was prepared to weaken its Pacific fleet to help secure the Atlantic . 
 Posted to Britain , Burrell was appointed commanding officer of the newly commissioned N @-@ class destroyer HMAS Norman on 15 September 1941 . The ship 's first operation was transporting a Trade Union Congress delegation led by Sir Walter Citrine to Archangel , Russia . After returning to Britain , she steamed to the Indian Ocean to join Admiral Sir James Somerville 's Eastern Fleet at Addu Atoll , Maldives , on 26 February 1942 . Following the Eastern Fleet 's withdrawal to Kilindini , Kenya , Norman took part in the capture of Diego Suarez on Madagascar on 7 May . Later that month , she was reassigned to the Mediterranean and in June was involved in Operation Vigorous , an unsuccessful attempt to resupply the besieged island of Malta . Transferred back to the Indian Ocean , Burrell led Norman in the second campaign of the Battle of Madagascar in September , and was mentioned in despatches on 19 February 1943 for his " bravery and resource " during the operation . By this time Norman was escorting convoys in the Pacific , before deploying to the South Atlantic for anti @-@ submarine duties in April – May . 
 On 23 June 1943 , Burrell relinquished command of Norman and returned to the Navy Office , Melbourne , as Director of Plans . Having been divorced from his first wife Margaret in November 1941 , he married mineralogist Ada Weller ( also known as Ada Coggan ) on 21 April 1944 ; the couple had a son and two daughters . Burrell took charge of the RAN 's latest Tribal @-@ class destroyer , HMAS Bataan , at her commissioning in Sydney on 25 May 1945 . Arriving on the scene too late to see action , the ship was deployed to Japan via the Philippines in July , docking in Tokyo on 31 August . There she participated in the formal surrender ceremonies that took place on 2 September aboard USS Missouri . Bataan remained in Japan as Australian Squadron representative until November , assisting with the repatriation of inmates from Japanese prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camps . On a mission to one such camp at Sendai , Burrell located crewmen from the light cruiser HMAS Perth , which had been sunk in the early hours of 1 March 1942 during the Battle of Sunda Strait ; 320 of her complement of 680 survived the sinking , 105 dying in captivity . 
 = = Post @-@ war career = = 
 Burrell 's first appointment following the cessation of hostilities was as commander of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla . He was promoted captain in June 1946 , and became Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff ( DCNS ) that October . As DCNS , Burrell played a major role in establishing the Navy 's Fleet Air Arm and preparing for the introduction of carrier @-@ based aircraft . He was appointed an aide @-@ de @-@ camp to Governor @-@ General William McKell in July 1947 . From October 1948 to the end of 1949 , Burrell served as commanding officer of the heavy cruiser HMAS Australia , flagship of the RAN . Posted to Britain in 1950 , he attended the Imperial Defence College , London , and spent two years as Assistant Australian Defence Representative . He took command of the light aircraft carrier HMAS Vengeance on 2 December 1952 , less than three weeks after she was commissioned into the RAN after transfer from the Royal Navy . The ship began working up for deployment to the Korean War in June 1953 , but in the end her place was taken by the carrier HMAS Sydney . Vengeance was involved in a collision with HMAS Bataan near the Cocos Islands on 5 April 1954 , while acting as part of the escort for the Royal Yacht of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip during their inaugural tour of Australia , but continued on duty . 
 Completing his tour as captain of Vengeance , Burrell briefly resumed the role of Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff in August 1954 . The following month he was made an aide @-@ de @-@ camp to the Queen . Burrell was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1955 New Year Honours . In February he became Flag Officer of the Australian Fleet , with the acting rank of rear admiral ; this was made substantive in July . On 12 May 1956 , he hoisted his standard aboard the recently arrived aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne , marking her replacement of sister ship HMAS Sydney as flagship of the RAN . Burrell was posted soon afterwards to the Navy Office , Canberra , to redevelop the service 's officer structure , leading to a new General List of officers ' seniority . He served as Second Naval Member ( Personnel ) from September 1956 until January 1958 , when he again became Flag Officer of the Australian Fleet . Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1959 New Years Honours , Burrell was raised to vice admiral on 24 February and became First Naval Member , the Chief of the Naval Staff ( CNS ) . He succeeded Vice Admiral Sir Roy Dowling . 
 As CNS , Vice Admiral Burrell had to contend with a threat by Defence Minister Athol Townley to disband the Navy 's fixed @-@ wing Fleet Air Arm capability by 1963 , but gained approval for a major vessel re @-@ equipment drive that was to include new submarines , destroyers , minesweepers , and auxiliaries . This led among other things to the procurement of British Oberon @-@ class submarines , selected by Burrell when his original preference for an Australian @-@ built craft proved too expensive , as well as Ton @-@ class minesweepers and the Navy 's first purpose @-@ designed hydrographic survey ship , HMAS Moresby . The re @-@ equipment program also resulted in augmentation of the RAN 's rotary @-@ wing assets with Westland Wessex anti @-@ submarine warfare helicopters . Most significant was the purchase of three Charles F. Adams @-@ class guided @-@ missile destroyers , a decision of " ingenuity and forethought " on the part of Burrell and Navy Minister John Gorton , according to historian Tom Frame . The CNS and his minister enjoyed a close working relationship ; Burrell declared that Gorton " deserves our thanks for his efforts " , and Gorton called Burrell " one of the most honest , sincere and most dedicated sailors " . 
 The purchase of the destroyers signalled a shift in reliance for equipment from Britain to the United States that was contrary to prevailing Australian defence policy at the time , particularly in what historian Jeffrey Grey described as " the most British of the Australian services , the RAN " , and provoked pressure from the Royal Navy and UK shipbuilders , which had lobbied for purchase of their County @-@ class destroyer . Burrell later declared that the superiority of the US weapons system was a key factor in his preference for the Adams design over the County class . On a mission overseas to discuss trends and acquisitions in January 1960 , he was rebuffed by Britain 's Chief of the Defence Staff , Admiral of the Fleet Lord Louis Mountbatten , who mistakenly thought him responsible for the imminent dissolution of the RAN 's Fleet Air Arm , but warmly welcomed by the US Chief of Naval Operations , Admiral Arleigh Burke . As it happened , Burrell would gain credit for maintaining the integrity of the FAA , and its fixed @-@ wing component remained viable until the early 1980s . He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen 's Birthday Honours , gazetted on 3 June 1960 . In June 1961 , he met with his opposite numbers in the Army and Air Force at a Chiefs of Staff Committee conference to discuss the necessity of Australia acquiring nuclear weapons ; the chiefs agreed that the probability such a capability would be required was remote but that it should remain an option under certain circumstances , a position the defence forces maintained during the ensuing decade . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 Burrell made his farewell to the Australian Fleet aboard HMAS Melbourne at Jervis Bay on 8 February 1962 . He left the Navy on 23 February , and was succeeded as CNS by Vice Admiral Hastings Harrington . Burrell retired to <unk> Park , his property near Braidwood in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales . His son Stuart followed him into the Royal Australian Naval College in 1963 . In retirement Burrell enjoyed horse racing both as a gambler and as the owner of several successful mounts . During the 1960s , he was also a member of the ACT Regional Selection Committee of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trusts . 
 Burrell suffered a serious heart attack in 1980 , having been diagnosed with cardiac problems shortly after his retirement from the Navy . His wife Ada died in August the following year . In 1986 , Burrell published his memoirs as Mermaids Do Exist : The Autobiography of Vice @-@ Admiral Sir Henry Burrell , reflecting on what he described as a " lucky " career , and offering his thoughts on maritime strategy . He died on 9 February 1988 in Woden Valley Hospital . Survived by his three children , Sir Henry Burrell was buried in Gungahlin , Australian Capital Territory , following a private funeral . The Burrell Cup doubles tennis trophy , established by the admiral in 1955 , completed its fifty @-@ eighth year of competition in March 2013 . 
 = Glasser v. United States = 
 Glasser v. United States , 315 U.S. 60 ( 1942 ) , is a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision on two issues of constitutional criminal procedure . Glasser was the first Supreme Court decision to hold that the Assistance of Counsel Clause of the Sixth Amendment required the reversal of a criminal defendant 's conviction if his lawyer 's representation of him was limited by a conflict of interest . 
 Further , Glasser held that the exclusion of women ( other than members of the League of Women Voters who had taken a jury training class ) from the jury pool violated both the Impartial Jury Clause of the Sixth Amendment , but declined to reverse the other two convictions on this ground for technical reasons . Glasser is the first majority opinion of the Court to use the phrase " cross @-@ section of the community . " Glasser was also the first jury discrimination case to invoke the Sixth Amendment ( rather than Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ) . 
 The facts of Glasser were unusual as well . According to a contemporary Chicago Tribune article , it was " the first time federal employees here have been charged with tampering with federal court justice . " The five @-@ week trial involved more than 100 witnesses , more than 4 @,@ 000 transcript pages of testimony and argument , and 228 exhibits . 
 = = Background = = 
 All of the Court 's prior jury pool discrimination cases had involved the exclusion of African @-@ Americans and been litigated under the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause . The Court had come the closest to articulating a " fair cross @-@ section of the community " doctrine in Smith v. Texas ( 1940 ) . There , the Court stated : " It is part of the established tradition in the use of juries as instruments of public justice that the jury be a body truly representative of the community . " 
 Daniel D. Glasser and Norton I. Kretske were Assistant United States Attorneys in the Northern District of Illinois , specializing in liquor and revenue offenses . Glasser and Kretske solicited bribes from defendants under indictment , or soon to be indicted . Glasser and six other assistants resigned on April 7 , 1939 , during the tenure of U.S. Attorney William Joseph Campbell . According to Campbell : " Mr. Glasser has the best record of convictions of any one in this office and his conviction record in alcohol cases is the best in the entire country . Since I have been in office , Mr. Glasser has prosecuted ninety @-@ nine cases and lost only one . He hasn 't lost a jury case in three and a half years . "

 U.S. Attorney Campbell presented the case to the grand jury personally . Glasser , Kretske , Alfred E. Roth , Anthony Horton , and Louis Kaplan were indicted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on two counts of a bribery conspiracy on September 29 , 1939 . Glasser and Kretske were former Assistant U.S. Attorneys ; Roth was a defense attorney representing the bribe payors in the majority of the cases alleged to be fixed ; and Horton and Kaplan were " go @-@ betweens " for the bribes . Horton was an African @-@ American bail bondsman ; Kaplan was a purveyor of untaxed liquor . The allegations were that the prosecutors either agreed to recommend the dismissal of charges or ensured that the grand jury would not return an indictment . The maximum authorized sentence under the charges was two years imprisonment and a $ 10 @,@ 000 fine . All five made bail of $ 1 @,@ 500 each .

 The trial began on February 6 , 1940 before Judge Patrick Thomas Stone , of the Western District of Wisconsin , sitting by designation . The prosecution 's opening statement was delivered by Martin Ward , the chief of the criminal division . Defense attorney William Scott Stewart 's opening statement argued that Glasser and Kretske were set up by E.C. <unk> , the head of the alcohol tax unit . Stewart was the leader of a " battery of high priced defense counsel . " 
 The government 's first witness , U.S. Attorneys ' Office clerk Gordon Morgan testified that Glasser had suggested that Sidney S. <unk> be appointed <unk> of a grand jury that returned only eight out of twenty indictments and that Glasser and <unk> had conferred frequently . Another prosecution witness , illegal distillery landlord William F. Workman , testified that Capone @-@ affiliated Louis Schiavone had posted approximately $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in bail bonds . 
 On the sixth day of trial , alcohol tax agent Patrick Donoghue testified that , in a case that Donoghue had investigated , Glasser persuaded a grand jury to reverse itself after returning an indictment by placing the matter on the pending call indefinitely . Another government witness , bootlegging handyman Ralph Sharp testified that he had paid Kretske $ 250 in order for Kretske , as prosecutor , to recommend that the charges against him be dismissed ( which they were ) . Frank <unk> , another bootlegger turned government witness , testified that he had paid Kretske $ 1 @,@ 300 to recommend the dismissal of two cases and was convicted in the third case after he refused to pay $ 1 @,@ 000 . After he was indicted the third time , he testified , Glasser declined to intervene on his behalf , saying : " You 're going to jail for five years ; I can 't do anything about it . For all the money in the world I couldn 't help you . This isn 't an ordinary case . Agents are in town from Washington . " 
 Still another , Walter Kwiatkowski , testified that he paid Horton $ 600 ( in addition to the $ 200 bond ) to have the case against him dropped where Glasser was acting as prosecutor . And another , Victor <unk> , testified that he twice paid bribes to Kretske in cases that Glasser was handling ( <unk> was convicted a third time , after refusing to pay Kretske , in a case prosecuted by Ward himself ) . Mae and Anthony <unk> , two small @-@ time bootleggers , testified that Glasser declined to prosecute them in exchange for the name of their bootlegging boss . 
 <unk> Nicholas <unk> and his accountant William <unk> testified that <unk> transferred $ 3 @,@ 000 to <unk> that was paid to Kretske . Alexander Campbell , an Assistant U.S. Attorney from Indiana testified that Roth had offered him a bribe in a bootlegging case , saying : " That 's the way we handle things in Chicago . " The government 's final witness , alcohol tax investigator Thomas Bailey , testified that Glasser had repeatedly delayed a grand jury in a case he was involved with . 
 The government rested its case on February 26 . Judge Stone denied the defense 's motion for a directed verdict .

 Three judges testified as character witnesses : John Peter Barnes ( N.D. Ill . ) on behalf of Glasser , Kretske , and Roth ; Charles Edgar Woodward ( N.D. Ill . ) on behalf of Glasser and Kretske ; and state judge John F. Haas on behalf of Kretske . Kaplan and Horton both took the stand , denying that they ever paid money to Glasser or Kretske . Two defense attorneys , Henry Balaban and Edward J. Hess ( who was representing Kaplan at the trial ) , who had also defended clients in cases the government 's case @-@ in @-@ chief had alleged to be fixed , denying paying bribes to Glasser or Kretske ( although the government had not accused them of this ) . Glasser 's testimony took three hours , as he was cross @-@ examined individually about every single case that the government had alleged to have been fixed . 
 The defense rested on March 4 , after five weeks of trial . Assistant United States Attorney Francis <unk> delivered the prosecution 's closing argument . Stewart and George Callaghan closed for Glasser and Kretske ; Hess for Kaplan ; Cassius Poust for Roth ; Ward concluded the government 's argument . Stewart 's closing focused on the credibility of the prosecution 's witnesses , many of whom had been transported from prison to testify . Stewart urged the jury not to take the word of " crooks and convicts . "

 The jury retired at 3 : 30 p.m. March 7 . At 11 : 30 p.m. , Judge Stone ordered the jury to continue deliberating through the night . The jury returned at 7 : 20 a.m. March 8 , after 16 hours of deliberation ; all five were convicted of a conspiracy to defraud the United States . For several hours , the jury had been deadlocked 11 to 1 for conviction , with one female juror as the holdout . 
 Judge Stone denied the defendants ' motion for a new trial . Glasser and Kretske were sentenced to 14 months imprisonment . Roth was fined $ 500 ; Horton was placed on two @-@ years probation with a suspended sentence of one year and one day . Kaplan was sentenced to 14 months imprisonment , failed to surrender on June 28 , and was captured on August 1 .

 = = = Seventh Circuit = = = 
 Glasser , Kretske , and Roth appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit . Oral arguments were heard on October 17 before Judges William Morris Sparks , Walter Emanuel Treanor , and Otto Kerner , Sr. The Seventh Circuit , in an opinion by Judge Kerner , affirmed their convictions on December 13 , 1940 . " On oral argument the principal point stressed was that the evidence failed to sustain the verdict of the jury , although other points were raised in the briefs . " 
 The defendants argued : ( 1 ) that the indictment should have been quashed because of the absence of women from the grand jury ; ( 2 ) that the indictment was not returned in open court ; ( 3 ) that the indictment was duplicitous , inconsistent , and vague ; ( 4 ) that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict ; ( 5 ) that the trial judge should have granted a continuance , rather than appoint Stewart to represent Kretske ; ( 6 ) that Roth should have been severed from the other defendants ; ( 7 ) that the reports of the Alcohol Tax Unit were hearsay ; ( 7 ) that the two government exhibits not admitted into evidence were sent to the jury during its deliberations ; ( 8 ) that Glasser had been cross @-@ examined on matters not pertinent to the charge and not within the scope of his direct examination ; ( 9 ) that the cross @-@ examination of U.S. Attorney Campbell had been unduly restricted ; ( 10 ) that evidence beyond the scope of the bill of particulars had been introduced ; ( 11 ) that there was insufficient corroboration of the accomplice testimony against Kretske ; ( 12 ) that certain testimony of Alexander Campbell was erroneously admitted ; ( 13 ) that the admission of various prejudicial evidence had the cumulative effect of denying the defendants a fair trial ; ( 14 ) that the trial judge 's cross @-@ examination of witnesses and other comments crossed the line into advocacy ; and ( 15 ) that the trial judge should have granted a new trial because of the exclusion of women from the jury pool . 
 Former United States Attorney General Homer S. Cummings petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari , which was granted on April 7 , 1941 . Ralph M. Snyder also represented Glasser before the Supreme Court . By this time , J. Albert Woll was the U.S. Attorney in the Northern District .

 In an opinion by Justice Murphy , the Court reversed the conviction of Glasser ( No. 30 ) and affirmed the convictions of the other two defendants ( Nos. 31 and 32 ) . 
 = = = Conflict @-@ free counsel = = = 
 Glasser was represented by Callaghan and Stewart . Kretske was dis @-@ satisfied with his prior retained counsel , and the trial judge proposed appointing Stewart to also represent Kretske . Stewart explained the potential conflict thus : 
 [ There is ] some little inconsistency in the defense , and the main part of it is this : There will be conversations here where Mr. Glasser wasn 't present , where people have seen Mr. Kretske and they have talked about , that they gave money to take care of Glasser , that is not binding on Mr. Glasser , and there is a <unk> there , and Mr. Glasser feels that if I would represent Mr. Kretske the jury would get an idea that they are together . . . . 
 The trial judge , over the prior objection of Glasser , appointed Stewart to represent Kretske . Stewart represented both Glasser and Kretske throughout the proceeding . Glasser did not raise the issue again until the appeal was filed . 
 The Court reversed Glasser 's conviction because his counsel had a conflict of interest . The Court held that : 
 [ T ] he " assistance of counsel " guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment contemplates that such assistance be untrammeled and unimpaired by a court order requiring that one lawyer shall simultaneously represent conflicting interests . If the right to the assistance of counsel means less than this , a valued constitutional safeguard is substantially impaired . 
 The Court rejected the suggestions that Glasser had waived his Sixth Amendment right by failing to re @-@ object or that Glasser 's status an experienced former federal prosecutor precluded relief . 
 The Court concluded that the conflict of interest materialized in a few ways . First , Stewart declined to cross @-@ examine one of the witnesses , who could implicate Kretske but not Glasser , for fear that it would strengthen the case against Kretske . Stewart also failed to object to the testimony of other witnesses regarding prior statements of Kretske ; under the rules of hearsay , these statements were obviously admissible against Kretske , but less obviously admissible against Glasser without a predicate showing that Glasser was a co @-@ conspirator . Stewart feared that an objection only on behalf of Glasser would highlight the admissibility of the statements against Kretske . 
 In addition to finding that Glasser was prejudiced by the conflict , the Court further stated that : 
 Glasser wished the benefit of the undivided assistance of counsel of his own choice . We think that such a desire on the part of an accused should be respected . Irrespective of any conflict of interest , the additional burden of representing another party may conceivably impair counsel 's effectiveness . To determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained by Glasser as a result of the court 's appointment of Stewart as counsel for Kretske is at once difficult and unnecessary . The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial . 
 But , the court declined to reverse the convictions of Kretske and Roth on this basis , concluding that they were not prejudiced . 
 = = = Exclusion of women from the jury pool = = = 
 The defendants alleged in an affidavit that only women who were members of the Illinois League of Women Voters and who had completed a jury training class ( taught by a local prosecutor ) were included in the jury pool . The defendants ' jury was composed of six men and six women . 
 The Court dwelt at length on the defendants ' claim . The Court held that : 
 [ Federal jury selectors ] must not allow the desire for competent jurors to lead them into selections which do not comport with the concept of the jury as a cross @-@ section of the community . Tendencies , no matter how slight , toward the selection of jurors by any method other than a process which will insure a trial by a representative group are undermining processes weakening the institution of jury trial , and should be sturdily resisted . That the motives influencing such tendencies may be of the best must not blind us to the dangers of allowing any encroachment whatsoever on this essential right . Steps innocently taken may , one by one , lead to the irretrievable impairment of substantial liberties . 
 The Court further held that : " The deliberate selection of jurors from the membership of particular private organizations definitely does not conform to the traditional requirements of jury trial . " But , the Court held that the submission of an affidavit , even if un @-@ contradicted , which contained an offer to prove the exclusion of women from the jury pool was insufficient to preserve the error ; instead , the defendants must actually introduce evidence , or attempt to formally offer evidence , to support the claim . 
 = = = Other issues = = = 
 The court rejected the defendant 's other arguments : ( 1 ) that women were improperly excluded from the grand jury under Illinois law ( as incorporated by federal jury selection law at the time ) ; ( 2 ) that the indictment was not returned in open court because the notation indicating that the indictment was returned in open court was added after the fact ; ( 3 ) that the indictment was insufficiently definite ; ( 4 ) that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction ; ( 5 ) that the admission of certain evidence was prejudicial ; and ( 6 ) that the trial judge 's own questioning of certain witnesses and limitations on cross @-@ examination were prejudicial . 
 The Court stated that : " Since we are of opinion that a new trial must be ordered as to Glasser , we do not at this time feel that it is proper to comment on the sufficiency of the evidence against Glasser . " 
 = = = Frankfurter 's dissent = = = 
 Justice Frankfurter , joined by Chief Justice Stone , in dissent , would not have reversed Glasser 's conviction . They argued that Glasser had acquiesced to the appointment by his silence , especially in light of his years of experience as a federal criminal prosecutor , and had failed to preserve the error by not objecting . Further , the dissent argued that the joint representation was beneficial : 
 A conspiracy trial presents complicated questions of strategy for the defense . There are advantages and disadvantages in having separate counsel for each defendant or a single counsel for more than one . Joint representation is a means of insuring against reciprocal recrimination . A common defense often gives strength against a common attack . 
 Further , the dissent denied that prejudice had arisen in the two examples highlighted by the majority . 
 = = Subsequent developments = = 
 On remand , Judge Stone denied Kretske probation and set his sentence to begin on April 10 , 1942 . Judge Sullivan dismissed a different indictment against Kretske on April 9 . Judge F. Ryan Duffy , of the Eastern District of Wisconsin , sitting by designation , denied a government motion to dismiss Kretske 's habeas petition on April 14 and set a hearing for the following day . Judge Duffy denied Kretske bail and denied the petition of April 15 . 
 Pending retrial , Glasser was free on $ 2 @,@ 500 bail . Attorney General Francis Biddle appointed Edward A. Kelly as a special assistant to consider whether Glasser should be retried . Kelly recommended that Glasser not be retried , and Biddle wrote to Judge Evan Alfred Evans of the Seventh Circuit asking him to assign a judge to the <unk> pros motion ; Judge Evans assigned himself . Over the protests of Judge Evans , all charges against Glasser were dropped on January 6 , 1943 . Kelly argued to Judge Evans that there would be insufficient evidence at a retrial because much of the original evidence would not be admissible if Glasser were retried alone . Judge Evans was " suspicious " of the motion and " all but argued that the case had been fixed . " Glasser returned to private practice . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 = = = Conflict @-@ free counsel = = = 
 Glasser was " the Supreme Court 's first vehicle for the examination of joint representation . " The Court continued to deal with this issue in Dukes v. Warden ( 1972 ) , Holloway v. Arkansas ( 1978 ) , Cuyler v. Sullivan ( 1980 ) , Burger v. Kemp ( 1987 ) , Wheat v. United States ( 1988 ) , and Mickens v. Taylor ( 2002 ) . 
 Cuyler summarized Glasser as follows : 
 Glasser established that unconstitutional multiple representation is never harmless error . Once the Court concluded that Glasser 's lawyer had an actual conflict of interest , it refused " to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice " attributable to the conflict . The conflict itself demonstrated a denial of the " right to have the effective assistance of counsel . " Thus , a defendant who shows that a conflict of interest actually affected the adequacy of his representation need not demonstrate prejudice in order to obtain relief . But until a defendant shows that his counsel actively represented conflicting interests , he has not established the constitutional predicate for his claim of ineffective assistance . 
 Justice <unk> 's statement in dissent that " A common defense often gives strength against a common attack " was quoted by the majority in Holloway . 
 = = = Fair cross @-@ section of the community = = = 
 Glasser is the first majority opinion of the Court to use the phrase " cross @-@ section of the community , " and the first jury discrimination case to invoke the Sixth Amendment ( rather than equal protection ) . " The democratic overhaul of the jury began with the Supreme Court 's decision in Glasser v. United States . " 
 Prof. Barbara Underwood has opined that : 
 Equal protection may have seemed inapt to the litigants or to the Court for a case of sex discrimination in 1942 , or it may have seemed inapt for a case of cross @-@ group challenge . The Sixth Amendment was not again invoked by the Supreme Court against jury discrimination for thirty years ; the Sixth Amendment did not ( yet ) apply to state juries , and in federal cases the Court seemed to prefer its supervisory power over lower federal courts . 
 The Supreme Court would eventually reverse criminal convictions due to the exclusion of women from the jury pool in Taylor v. Louisiana ( 1975 ) and Duren v. Missouri ( 1979 ) . The fair cross @-@ section requirement was extended to civil cases in Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co . ( 1946 ) , where wage earners had been excluded from the jury pool .

 The ship was armed with three 24 cm K L / 35 guns mounted in three single gun turrets . Two were placed side by side forward , and the third was located aft of the main superstructure . They were supplied with a total of 204 rounds of ammunition . The ship was also equipped with eight 8 @.@ 8 cm SK L / 30 guns in single mounts . Hildebrand also carried four 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes , all in swivel mounts on the deck . One was at the bow , another at the stern , and two amidships .

 Hildebrand was laid down in 1890 at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel . She was launched on 6 August 1892 , and completed on 28 October 1893 . Hildebrand participated in the fleet maneuvers in 1894 , alongside two of her sister ships in the IV Division of the fleet . The Division was based in Danzig with some torpedo boats and operated as the German fleet in mock engagements with the I Division , which simulated the Russian Baltic Fleet . In 1897 , Hildebrand again participated in the annual summer maneuvers in the III Division , along with Siegfried and Beowulf . Her other three sisters were assigned to the IV Division . Hildebrand , Siegfried , Heimdall , and Ägir simulated the hostile fleet during the 1900 summer exercises . 
 Hildebrand served on active duty with the fleet until 1901 , when she was taken into drydock at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Danzig for an extensive reconstruction . The ship was lengthened to 86 @.@ 13 m ( 282 @.@ 6 ft ) , which increased displacement to 4 @,@ 236 t ( 4 @,@ 169 long tons ; 4 @,@ 669 short tons ) . Her old boilers were replaced with eight new Marine type boilers , and a second funnel was added . Her secondary battery was increased to ten 8 @.@ 8 cm guns , and the 35 cm torpedo tubes were replaced with three 45 cm ( 18 in ) tubes . Work was completed by 1902 . 
 Hildebrand returned to the fleet after her modernization was completed , assigned to the II Squadron , alongside Heimdall , Hagen , and Beowulf . She remained in the fleet where she remained until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , when she was mobilized into the VI Battle Squadron for coastal defense , along with her sister ships . On 31 August 1915 , the VI Battle Squadron was demobilized , and Hildebrand 's crew was transferred to other warships . She was then used as a barracks ship in Windau . On 17 June 1919 , she was stricken from the naval register . She was sold to the Netherlands for scrapping , but ran aground while en route to the breakers . In 1933 , her wreck was blown up and subsequently broken up in situ . 
 = Swayamvaram = 
 Swayamvaram ( English : One 's Own Choice ) is a 1972 Indian Malayalam @-@ language drama film co @-@ written and directed by Adoor Gopalakrishnan , starring Madhu and Sharada in the lead roles . Notable smaller roles were played by <unk> Sukumaran Nair , Adoor Bhavani , K. P. A. C. Lalitha , and Bharath Gopi . The film depicts the life of a couple — Vishwam ( Madhu ) and Sita ( Sharada ) — who have married against their parents ' wishes and want to start a new life at a new place . The title is an allusion to the ancient Indian practice of a girl of marriageable age choosing a husband from among a list of suitors . 
 Swayamvaram marked several debuts — directorial of Gopalakrishnan , acting of the Malayalam star Bharath Gopi , and film producing of the Chitralekha Film Cooperative , an organisation cofounded by Gopalakrishnan himself . The film features an original score by M. B. Sreenivasan , camerawork by Mankada Ravi Varma , and film editing by <unk> . Writer @-@ director K. P. Kumaran co @-@ scripted the film with Gopalakrishnan . It took seven years for Gopalakrishnan to get the project rolling when his initial proposal for a loan to make a film was turned down by the Film Finance Corporation ( FFC ) . The FFC later partially financed the film when Chitralekha provided the rest . 
 The film received widespread critical acclaim . It pioneered the new wave cinema movement in Malayalam cinema and became one of the first Malayalam films to use synchronised sound and outdoor locales . The film also became the first Indian film to use sound as a leitmotif . It was shown at various film festivals around the world , and won four National Film Awards at the 20th National Film Awards in 1973 , including Best Feature Film , Best Director for Gopalakrishnan , and Best Actress for Sharada .

Initially , they stay in a decent hotel but soon due to financial reasons they move to another , ordinary hotel . 
 Vishwam , an educated , unemployed youth , is an aspiring writer and had some of his short stories published in the newspapers earlier . He dreams of having his novel , titled <unk> ( Ecstasy ) , published in the newspaper . He meets one of the newspaper editors ( Vaikom Chandrasekharan Nair ) , who agrees to read his novel but declines to publish it as Vishwam does not have many writings to his credit . Sita is offered a job as a sales girl but cannot accept it because she is unable to pay the required security deposit of ₹ 1 @,@ 000 . With several unsuccessful attempts to get a job , the increasing financial pressure forces them to shift to a slum . With an old lady named Janaki ( Adoor Bhavani ) and a prostitute named Kalyani ( K. P. A. C.

 While studying in the Film and Television Institute of India , Pune , Gopalakrishnan was influenced by the New Wave movement of global cinema and formed a film society in Kerala , named " Chitralekha Film Cooperative " , with his classmates in 1965 . Gopalakrishnan had initially submitted a romantic script <unk> to the Film Finance Corporation ( now National Film Development Corporation of India or <unk> ) which they declined to finance . Later , he submitted the script for Swayamvaram , which Film Finance Corporation accepted and approved the loan of a ₹ 150 @,@ 000 ( US $ 2 @,@ 200 ) . However , it took seven years for him to get the film rolling , after he passed out of the Film and Television Institute of India . Gopalakrishnan co @-@ scripted the film with writer @-@ director K.

Initially , Chitralekha Film Co @-@ operative , the producer of the film had trouble distributing the film , so they decided to do it by themselves . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 <unk> wanted fresh faces for both the lead roles and he had written letters to various heads of colleges and universities for the auditions . However , he did not receive any response from anywhere . For the female lead , Gopalakrishnan approached Sharada , one of the most successful actresses of her time . She was acting in commercial films when Gopalakrishnan asked her to star in Swayamvaram . Sharada was initially reluctant to commit herself to an art film , but agreed when Gopalakrishnan narrated the complete story to her at Prasad Studios , in Chennai . The male lead for the film , Madhu , was an old friend of Gopalakrishnan and had expressed a desire to act in one of his films . By the time Gopalakrishnan finished his studies and returned from FTII , Madhu was already a star in Malayalam cinema . Gopalakrishnan then decided to cast him opposite Sharada . Mentioning about his experience working with Gopalakrishnan and Swayamvaram , Madhu recollected in an interview that " [ ... ] when Gopalakrishnan narrated the story of Swayamvaram , I knew it was going to be different . " Years later he also mentioned that he " sometimes wished Prem Nazir had acted in Adoor 's Swayamvaram . He might have won a Bharath award . But he was very busy those days . " 
 Malayalam actor @-@ director <unk> Sukumaran Nair was cast as a college principal . Bharath Gopi , who later became a major actor in the Malayalam film industry , made his film debut in Swayamvaram , doing a minor role as the dismissed factory employee who gets replaced by Madhu . Gopi was a noted stage actor before Swayamvaram and would later play the lead role in Gopalakrishnan 's second feature film , <unk> , which earned him a reputation as one of the finest actors in Indian cinema and also inspired his screen name as " Bharath Gopi " or " <unk> Gopi " . He won a Best Actor award , then known as " Bharat Award " , for the role at the 25th National Film Awards in 1977 . 
 K. P. A. C. Lalitha , who would later play notable characters in many of Gopalakrishnan 's films , played a small role as a prostitute in Swayamvaram . Noted Malayalam writer and journalist Vaikom Chandrasekharan Nair played a newspaper editor in the film . Gopalakrishnan praised him for his performance , expressing the difficulties of performing as oneself onscreen . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Due to financial crises , it took more than one and a half years for Gopalakrishnan to finish the film . Swayamvaram was one of the first Malayalam films to use synchronised sound and to be filmed in outdoor locales , for which Gopalakrishnan used his Nagra audio recorder . The film was shot in two schedules . It was delayed due to scheduling conflicts of the lead actress , Sharada . She was working in several films at that time , so Gopalakrishnan had to arrange the schedule to suit her convenience . The lead actor , Madhu , mentioned in an interview that Gopalakrishnan was clear about his characters and their behaviour . Gopalakrishnan also used to discuss the shoot with his crew before the shooting . 
 The film marked the beginning of a collaboration between Gopalakrishnan and cinematographer Mankada Ravi Varma . Gopalakrishnan had seen Varma 's work in his second film as a cinematographer , <unk> <unk> ( 1970 ) , and when he decided to work on Swayamvaram , Gopalakrishnan approached Varma with the script . Initially reluctant , Varma agreed to do the film due to its " extensive " and " very well written " script . Incidentally , Varma won his only National Film Award for Best Cinematography , with a career spanned over thirty years , for Swayamvaram . The film featured no songs and has only an original score by M. B. Sreenivasan . The editing of the film was done by <unk> , whereas S. S. Nair and <unk> worked together on the production design . Sound mixing was done by P. Devadas . The total budget of the film was ₹ 250 @,@ 000 ( US $ 3 @,@ 700 ) , where the Film Finance Corporation provided ₹ 150 @,@ 000 as a loan .

 The previews of the film were held at various places , where it was well received by critics and audiences . Noted writer M.

Various intellectuals and writers took part in it , including noted film experts like P. Bhaskaran and director Balu Mahendra . Noted critic and film director <unk> mentioned that Devadas 's sound mixing work was one of the major attractions of the film . Considerable use of natural sound , apart from background music , was new for Malayalam cinema . Cast performances were also praised by critics . Bharath Gopi received considerable attention even for his minimal screen appearance . Though Madhu had acted previously in several films , including Ramu Kariat 's National Award @-@ winning film , <unk> ( 1965 ) , Swayamvaram marked a turning point in his career . 
 Although most of the reviews were positive , some film experts were critical about the film . <unk> Datta , in his book The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature , criticised the film for " following the neo @-@ realistic style " and showcasing " same old love story without any freshness added " . Poet and journalist C. P. <unk> called the film " disturbing " in one of his articles , criticising Gopalakrishnan and his films . Shyam Benegal , a film director and a well @-@ known admirer of Gopalakrishnan 's films , also mentioned that he was not particularly pleased with Swayamvaram . Some critics have pointed out its resemblance to Ritwik Ghatak 's <unk> ( 1965 ) . Gopalakrishnan agreed on influences of Ghatak and Satyajit Ray but pointed that Swayamvaram 's treatment is different from Ghatak 's <unk> as Swayamvaram is more about the trip . 
 The film received little critical response in Kerala , which Gopalakrishnan referred to as " more of a question of insensitivity rather than personal enmity . " However , some noted critics like <unk> <unk> and T. M. P. <unk> praised the movie , with <unk> writing a response titled " Swayamvaram over , what next in Malayalam cinema ? " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Swayamvaram pioneered the new wave cinema movement in Malayalam cinema . The film did not feature any dance numbers , comedy or melodramatic scenes , which were " usual ingredients " of films at that time , but it introduced viewers to then unknown techniques of film presentation , in which it was not merely used for " story @-@ telling " . It was an inevitable development for Malayalam cinema , as the film focused mainly on cinema rather than its story . The film also introduced film @-@ goers to a new cinematic art through the impulses generated by the film , which in turn were more important than the film itself . The film is also said to have divided Malayalam films into three different categories , " uncompromising art films " , " compromising films " which aimed at commercial success but tried maintaining a good deal of the artistic qualities , and the " commercial films " which purely aimed at box office success . 
 Through Swayamvaram , Gopalakrishnan became the first Indian director to use sound as a leitmotif ( a recurring musical theme ) . The film provided a new experience to Indian cinema @-@ goers , as it used ample amounts of natural sounds with a minimalistic background score .

 The National Film Archive of India has digitally restored the film , and the restored version with improved subtitles in English was screened at the International Film Festival of India in November 2012 .

 = New York State Route 32B = 
 New York State Route 32B ( NY 32B ) was a state highway in the Capital District region of New York , in the United States . The western terminus of the route was at an intersection with NY 32 in Queensbury . Its eastern terminus was at a junction with U.S. Route 4 ( US 4 ) in Hudson Falls . NY 32B , named Warren Street in Queensbury and River Street in Hudson Falls , ran along the banks of the Hudson River as it went from Glens Falls to Hudson Falls . It crossed over the Glens Falls Feeder Canal near its junction with NY 32 in Queensbury . 
 When NY 32B was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , it began at an intersection with US 4 and NY 32 in Northumberland and ended at US 9 in Glens Falls . The portion of the route between Northumberland and Hudson Falls was concurrent with US 4 upon assignment while the segment west of Boulevard in Queensbury became concurrent with NY 32 in 1949 . NY 32B was truncated north to Hudson Falls in the early 1940s and east to Boulevard c . 1962 . The route was partially replaced with NY 254 c . 1965 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 32B , as routed at the time of its removal , began at the intersection of Boulevard ( then @-@ NY 32 ) , Warren Street ( NY 32 west of Boulevard ) , and Highland Avenue east of Glens Falls in the Warren County town of Queensbury . The route headed east along Warren Street ( here named Lower Warren Street ) , paralleling the eastern bank of the Hudson River . It crossed over the Glens Falls Feeder Canal prior to reaching the Warren – Washington county line . Here , Warren Street turns north to straddle the county line ; however , NY 32B continued southeastward into Hudson Falls on River Street . NY 32B ended five blocks later at a junction with US 4 in downtown Hudson Falls . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1924 , Warren Street in Glens Falls and River Street in Hudson Falls became part of NY 30 , a highway that initially extended from Mechanicville to the Vermont state line near Fair Haven by way of Glens Falls and Whitehall . It was realigned by 1926 to continue north from Whitehall toward the Canadian border . In 1926 , the portion of NY 30 between Glens Falls and Whitehall was included in the new US 4 , which began in Glens Falls and continued east from Whitehall into Vermont by way of NY 30 's former routing . It was rerouted to follow its modern alignment south of Hudson Falls as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . US 4 's former routing between Glens Falls and Hudson Falls became part of NY 32B , a new route assigned in the renumbering that continued south to NY 32 in Northumberland by way of an overlap with US 4 . 
 NY 32B was gradually truncated as time went on . In the early 1940s , NY 32B was cut back on its east end to its junction with US 4 in Hudson Falls , eliminating its lengthy overlap with US 4 along the Hudson River . The route would have been severed from its parent , NY 32 , as a result ; however , NY 32 was extended northeastward along US 9 from South Glens Falls to NY 32B in Glens Falls by this time . On January 1 , 1949 , NY 32 was extended east to US 4 in Hudson Falls by way of Warren Street , Boulevard , and Feeder Street . The resulting overlap between NY 32 and NY 32B along Warren Street from downtown Glens Falls to Boulevard remained in place until c . 1962 when NY 32B was truncated on its western end to the eastern terminus of the overlap . 
 NY 32B ceased to exist altogether c . 1965 when the portion of NY 32B east of the newly constructed Quaker Road was incorporated into the new NY 254 . The segment of former NY 32B that did not become part of NY 254 — located on Lower Warren Street in Queensbury — is now NY 911E , an unsigned reference route 0 @.@ 20 miles ( 0 @.@ 32 km ) in length . It is one of three reference routes in Warren County . The NY 656 designation is reserved by the New York State Department of Transportation as a signed replacement for NY 911E ; however , there is no timetable for its assignment .

 = Garnet Malley = 
 Garnet Francis Malley , MC , AFC ( 2 November 1892 – 20 May 1961 ) was an Australian fighter ace of World War I , credited with six aerial victories . He was an aviation adviser to Chiang Kai @-@ shek 's government in China during the 1930s , and an intelligence officer in World War II . 
 Born in Sydney , Malley first saw service in World War I as an artilleryman with the Australian Imperial Force . He transferred to the Australian Flying Corps in 1917 , and the following year flew Sopwith Camels with No. 4 Squadron on the Western Front . Malley was awarded the Military Cross for his achievements in combat , and his subsequent work as a flying instructor in England earned him the Air Force Cross . 
 After a spell in civilian life following the war , Malley joined the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) in 1925 , serving with No. 3 Squadron . He became an aviation adviser to China in 1931 , and worked closely with Madame Chiang Kai @-@ shek , Soong Mei @-@ ling , from 1937 . Malley was able to observe air tactics in the Sino @-@ Japanese War at first hand , though his reports were given little weight in Australia . Returning home in 1940 , he served in intelligence roles with the RAAF and later the Commonwealth government . After the war he bought a plantation in Fiji , where he died in 1961 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Garnet Francis Malley , the second youngest of six children of Clara Ellen Merritt and Francis Malley , was born in Mosman , a suburb of Sydney , on 2 November 1892 . His father , an <unk> originally from Gosford , founded the <unk> firm Malley 's . He later served two terms as alderman of Mosman Council . Garnet Malley attended the Church of England Preparatory School in Mosman , The School in Mount Victoria , and Hawkesbury Agricultural College in Richmond . At the outbreak of World War I he was an apprentice mechanic at Malley 's . 
 = = World War I = = 
 Malley joined the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) on 12 October 1915 . He departed Melbourne for Egypt as a gunner with reinforcements of the 1st Field Artillery Brigade aboard HMAT Wandilla on 9 November . In March 1916 , he was posted to the Western Front in France , and joined his unit in May . The 1st Brigade took part in the Battles of Pozières and Mouquet Farm in July and August 1916 . Malley transferred to the Australian Flying Corps ( AFC ) as a mechanic in April 1917 , before undertaking flying instruction at the Oxford University air school . He was commissioned a second lieutenant on 9 October and assigned to No. 4 Squadron AFC , then based in Birmingham . 
 Equipped with Sopwith Camel fighters , No. 4 Squadron deployed to <unk> , France , in December 1917 , and commenced operations on 9 January 1918 . That same day Malley , nicknamed " <unk> " ( or " George " , by No. 4 Squadron 's leading ace , Harry Cobby ) , was promoted lieutenant . On 16 March , he achieved his first aerial victory , sending a fighter belonging to Manfred von Richthofen 's Red Circus out of control above Annoeullin , near Douai . Early reports identified the German plane as an Albatros , but later sources record it as a Pfalz <unk> Malley claimed two <unk> on 23 March 1918 , during an attack on German positions in Vaulx @-@ <unk> , near Bapaume . Three days later he was promoted captain and appointed a flight commander . 
 The official history of Australia in the war credits Malley with the destruction of a Pfalz over Wytschaete on 10 May , though it does not appear in other accounts of his final tally . Four days later , he and Lieutenant Roy King each claimed a German two @-@ seater spotting for artillery between Ypres and Bailleul . On 30 May , Malley and Cobby led their flights on a bombing mission in the Lys region , after which they each destroyed a German observation balloon over Estaires . Malley 's final victory , over the Lys on 1 June , was a Pfalz <unk> His official tally was six German aircraft destroyed — four fighters , an observation balloon , and an unidentified observation plane — and he was wounded in action twice , by a bullet through the leg in March , and by shrapnel from anti @-@ aircraft fire in May . He was awarded the Military Cross on 22 June . The citation was promulgated in The London Gazette : 
 Lt. ( T. / Capt. ) Garnet Francis Malley , Aust . F.C. , attd . R.F.C. 
 For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty . When on offensive and low @-@ flying patrol he attacked one of two hostile scouts , which eventually turned over and fell out of control , being seen to crash by another pilot . Later , a general engagement ensued with four enemy scouts , one of which he attacked , with the result that it fell completely out of control and crashed . Prior to this occasion he had also shot down out of control another hostile machine . His courage and able leadership have resulted in his patrol carrying out excellent work under the most adverse conditions . 
 Malley took temporary command of No. 4 Squadron at the end of June 1918 , overseeing its move from <unk> North to a new airfield at <unk> . In August , he was posted to No. 5 ( Training ) Squadron AFC at Minchinhampton , England . The squadron was part of the 1st Training Wing , led by Lieutenant Colonel Oswald Watt . Malley 's rotation to home establishment was in accordance with Royal Air Force policy requiring pilots to be rested and serve as instructors after nine to twelve months in combat . Known for flying a white Camel trainer , he received the Air Force Cross for his instructional work ; the award was promulgated on 3 June 1919 . 
 = = Inter @-@ war years = = 
 No. 5 Squadron was disbanded in May 1919 . Along with many other Australian Flying Corps personnel , including Colonel Watt , Major King , and Captain Les Holden , Malley returned to Australia aboard the troopship Kaisar @-@ i @-@ Hind , disembarking in Sydney on 19 June . He subsequently toured the country to promote the Peace Loan . On 24 August , while travelling from Melbourne to Sydney to commence his series of demonstration flights around New South Wales , Malley crashed his Avro 504K during takeoff from Benalla , Victoria . He was uninjured but had to return to Melbourne and eventually made his way north by train . Resuming his aerial program , he was reported on 17 September as having " thrilled " lunch @-@ time crowds in Sydney the previous day with " three daring spiral dives " over Hyde Park . Malley was discharged from the AIF on 4 October 1919 , and commissioned a captain in the Commonwealth Military Forces Reserve on 1 July 1920 . He rejoined Malley 's as a warehouse manager in 1921 . In May that year , he served with Les Holden and other veteran pilots as a pall @-@ bearer at Watt 's funeral in Randwick . On 25 January 1922 , Malley married Phyllis Kathleen Dare in Mosman . The union would produce one son , Maldon . Malley was acknowledged as both a source and a reviewer by F.M. Cutlack in the latter 's volume on the Australian Flying Corps , first published in 1923 as part of the official history of Australia in the war . 
 Malley relinquished his appointment in the Commonwealth Military Forces on 18 June 1925 . The following day , he was commissioned a flight lieutenant in the Citizen Air Force , the part @-@ time active reserve of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . He served as a pilot with No. 3 Squadron , which operated Airco DH.9s and Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s. Formed at RAAF Point Cook , Victoria , the squadron transferred to the newly opened RAAF Richmond , New South Wales , on 30 June . From 1925 to 1928 , Malley was vice president of the Australian Flying Corps Association . In January 1928 , he was promoted to honorary squadron leader , and temporarily commanded No. 3 Squadron in March – April . That year , he gave up his position with Malley 's to become an aviation consultant to Australian National Airways ( ANA ) , as well as a director of the company . In January – February 1929 , he again temporarily commanded No. 3 Squadron . That April , he was a member of the citizens ' committee responsible for organising and funding the search for the Southern Cross and its crew , Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm , who had force @-@ landed in North West Australia during a flight from Richmond to England . Les Holden eventually located the missing airmen near the Kimberley region . In 1930 , Malley transferred to the ( inactive ) RAAF Reserve . 
 By 1931 , ANA was in financial difficulties and Malley travelled to China to take up a position as an aviation adviser to Chiang Kai @-@ shek 's government in Kwangtung . Details of Malley 's exact duties over the next five years — a time of civil war and Japanese infiltration — remain uncertain . He spent some time in Australia on holiday in 1936 , after which he returned to his advisory role in China . On 1 February 1937 , through the influence of the British Foreign Office , Malley 's status was enhanced when he was made an honorary wing commander in the RAAF Reserve . He was by now serving as adviser to Madame Chiang Kai @-@ shek , Soong Mei @-@ ling , in her capacity as secretary @-@ general of the aeronautical commission that directed China 's air force ; May @-@ Ling extended to Malley her " warmest congratulations " for his " well deserved " promotion . One of the tasks she assigned him was investigating corrupt procurement practices in the government . Malley found that the air ministry was being defrauded by foreign agents and Chinese officials colluding to charge inflated prices for military equipment . 
 Malley 's stay increasingly involved him in the fighting in China ; his wife would relate three years of night @-@ time air raids to her friends upon the couple 's return to Australia in 1940 . In May 1938 , he advised the Chief of the Air Staff , Air Vice @-@ Marshal Richard Williams : " there is a first @-@ class war on here , which must eventually affect Australia and its defence schemes " . Williams and other members of the RAAF may , however , have perceived Malley as exaggerating the importance of his role in China , particularly given his apparent delight in its ceremonial aspects . In one letter , he regaled Williams with stories of an inspection tour around the country , declaring : " I ... can just imagine how much you would have enjoyed it – landing on aerodromes that were all polished up for inspection . Being met by provincial dignitaries and lavishly entertained . I had to drink every conceivable Chinese wine that was ever made , and to eat foods unheard of in Australia ! " At any rate , Malley 's reports of Japanese air tactics , and the value his observations might have held for Australia in the event of war in the Pacific , were largely discounted by his home government . 
 = = World War II and later life = = 
 Malley was recalled to Australia in July 1940 , departing China with a note of thanks from May @-@ Ling for his " loyal service " before rejoining the RAAF on active service as a squadron leader in October . He became the Air Force representative at the Combined Operational Intelligence Centre ( COIC ) , Melbourne , a tri @-@ service organisation responsible for intelligence collection , analysis and dissemination . Drawing on his knowledge of Japanese raids on Chinese airfields in the 1930s , Malley visited several RAAF stations in northern Australia to advise on protective measures ; it became evident in the wake of the attack on Darwin in February 1942 that none of his recommendations had been implemented . COIC primarily handled naval intelligence , so Army and Air Force participation was part @-@ time initially . By April 1941 , Malley had been assigned a full @-@ time role , and the RAAF was maintaining a round @-@ the @-@ clock presence . He was promoted to honorary wing commander in October 1941 , and two months later succeeded Commander Rupert Long as Director of COIC . Malley was raised to acting group captain on 1 July 1942 , but ill health forced him to relinquish his post on 3 October . He was discharged from the Air Force as medically unfit on 9 June 1943 . General Douglas MacArthur praised Malley for his " foresight , planning , and organizational ability " . The former aviator went on to work as officer @-@ in @-@ charge of the Chinese section at the Commonwealth Security Service in Canberra from January 1944 to March 1947 as an honorary group captain . 
 In 1948 , Malley 's war service was recognised by the United States with the award of the Legion of Merit . By 1949 , he had procured a yacht , the Royal Flight , which was used as a setting in the film The Blue Lagoon . The following year , the family bought a coconut plantation on Vanua <unk> , Fiji . In September 1951 , Malley and his wife toured the world , visiting Algiers , Guadaloupe , Curaçao , Martinique , and Tahiti . They subsequently returned to live on their Fijian plantation , and rode out the 1953 Suva earthquake and tidal wave . 
 Garnet Malley died of a heart attack on 20 May 1961 . Survived by his wife and son , he was buried at sea in an Anglican ceremony . The commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Taiwanese air force sent condolences , paying tribute to the " invaluable " contribution Malley had made during his decade in China , which would " be long remembered " .

 = Ranulf Flambard = 
 Ranulf Flambard ( sometimes Ralph Flambard , Ranulph Flambard , or Ranulf <unk> ; c . 1060 – 5 September 1128 ) was a medieval Norman Bishop of Durham and an influential government minister of King William Rufus of England . Ranulf was the son of a priest of Bayeux , Normandy , and his nickname Flambard means incendiary or torch @-@ bearer , and may have referred to his personality . He started his career under King William I of England , probably in the compilation of the Domesday Book , as well as being the keeper of the king 's seal . On the death of William I , Ranulf chose to serve the new king of England , William Rufus . 
 Under Rufus , he continued to hold the king 's seal , and also became involved in the financial administration of the kingdom , where he quickly made a name for himself by his novel methods of raising revenue . He was given custody of a number of vacant ecclesiastical offices , administering at one point sixteen vacant bishoprics or abbeys . His many duties have led to him being considered the first Chief Justiciar of England . During Rufus ' reign , Ranulf supervised the construction of the first stone bridge in London and oversaw the construction of the king 's hall at Westminster . In 1099 he was rewarded with the bishopric of Durham . 
 On the death of Rufus in 1100 , Ranulf was imprisoned in the Tower of London by Rufus ' successor Henry I of England . Ranulf was a convenient scapegoat for the financial extortions of Rufus ' reign . He became the first prisoner to escape from the Tower and went into exile in Normandy with Rufus ' and Henry 's older brother Robert Curthose , the Duke of Normandy . Ranulf became a leading advisor to Robert , and assisted in his unsuccessful invasion of England , an attempt to oust Henry from the throne . The brothers reconciled , but although Ranulf was restored to office he spent the next few years in Normandy , returning only after Henry had defeated Robert at the Battle of Tinchebray . Ranulf subsequently retired from political life , with only occasional appearances in public . He remained active in ecclesiastical affairs , attending councils and working to defend the rights of his see . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Ranulf was a Norman and the son of Thurstin , a parish priest in the diocese of Bayeux . Ranulf was probably born about 1060 , as he was close to 70 when he died in 1128 . Originally he worked for Odo of Bayeux , but he soon entered the chancery of King William I , Odo 's half @-@ brother . He stood out amongst the other clerks for his intelligence and his good looks . His nickname , Flambard , means torch @-@ bearer , incendiary or devouring flame ; and may have been given to him for his high @-@ spirited personality . Orderic Vitalis , a medieval chronicler , records that Robert <unk> gave the nickname to Ranulf , because Robert resented the fact that Ranulf , though of low birth , ordered the nobility around . Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury told the pope that the nickname came from Ranulf 's cruelty , which Anselm likened to a consuming flame . Orderic went on to claim that Ranulf was " educated from boyhood with base parasites among the hangers @-@ on of the court " . 
 Ranulf acquired the reputation of an able financier and administrator , and helped to increase the royal revenues . He appears to have played an important part in the compilation of the Domesday survey , perhaps even the main orchestrator of the project . Domesday Book gives his profession as clerk , and records him holding land in a number of counties . Before the death of the old king he became chaplain to Maurice , Bishop of London , whom he had formerly served in the chancery . Some sources call him " almost illiterate " , but this probably meant he was not formally educated in the liberal arts . His work in the chancery and as an administrator would have required knowledge of Latin . He also served as the keeper of the king 's seal from about 1085 . Once , while he was traveling in the Thames estuary with the seal , he was captured by pirates . Thinking quickly , he prevented the capture of the seal by throwing the seal into the sea . Although he served William the Conqueror , he does not attest a single genuine charter or writ of William 's , which implies he was not a leading servant . When King William died and his lands were split between his elder son Robert Curthose , who received Normandy , and the third son , William Rufus , who received England , Ranulf chose to serve Rufus in England . 
 = = Work under Rufus = = 
 Before the death of William the Conqueror , Ranulf held a prebend in the diocese of Salisbury . Early in the reign of Rufus he held the offices of dean of Christchurch in Twynham , Hampshire and was a prebendary of London and Lincoln . He was still keeper of the king 's seal , and also may have been in charge of the royal scriptorium . He is usually described as the chaplain of Rufus , but he is also called treasurer and sometimes <unk> <unk> . Other times his role is given the title procurator . William of Malmesbury calls him the " manager of the whole kingdom " . 
 At Christchurch , he reduced the number of canons serving the church from 25 to 13 , through not replacing clerks who died . Ranulf kept the revenues that would have gone to the missing canons and used it to rebuild the church . Some medieval sources claim that in rebuilding the church at Twynham , he not only demolished the church he was replacing , but nine others that were nearby . 
 As chief financial administrator , he bore the brunt of the chronicler 's condemnations for extortion and efforts to increase royal revenues . Besides attempts to increase the efficiency of collection and the rate of taxation , Ranulf created new methods of raising money . One of his new measures in revenue collection came in 1094 , when the fyrd , or English militia , was assembled in order to fight in Normandy against the king 's brother Robert Curthose . When all the men had assembled , instead of sending them to Normandy , Ranulf dismissed them , after collecting the 10 shillings that each man had been given by their district for maintenance . Ranulf then spent the money on mercenaries . Ranulf also actively pressed lawsuits , including bringing suit against Anselm on the day of Anselm 's consecration as Archbishop of Canterbury . Another innovation was the attempt to collect a relief , much like the relief due from vassals at the death of an overlord , from the under @-@ tenants of church lands when the church office changed hands . This attempt came at the death of Wulfstan , Bishop of Worcester in 1095 , when the king sent writs to the free tenants of the bishop , setting the amount of relief owed to the king . This attempt was not repeated , however . 
 He administered for the king a large proportion of the vacant ecclesiastical offices . He personally managed sixteen abbeys or bishoprics . Eventually he obtained the wealthy see of Durham for himself in May 1099 , being consecrated on 5 June 1099 . He had been the custodian of the see since the death of the previous bishop in early 1096 . At his consecration , he managed to avoid giving a profession of obedience to Thomas the Archbishop of York , just as his predecessor had done . William of Malmesbury , a medieval chronicler , accused Ranulf of paying 1 @,@ 000 pounds for the bishopric . He was given ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Carlisle and Cumbria , because his predecessors had done so as bishops of Lindisfarne , but he only exercised this for a short time , as after the accession of Henry I jurisdiction over these areas was transferred to the diocese of York . 
 It has been suggested that Ranulf may have been the first Justiciar of all England ( or chief justiciar ) , although he never held the title and it is not clear if his power was as extensive as Roger of Salisbury in the following reign . He ran the government of England while Rufus was fighting in Normandy , not only raising money , but issuing writs and judging court cases . William of Malmesbury in describing Ranulf 's financial efforts said that he " skinned the rich , ground the down the poor , and swept other men 's inheritances into his net . " Another medieval chronicler , Orderic Vitalis , said that Ranulf planned to revise the survey of England , almost certainly Domesday Book , and that he planned to use that revised survey to confiscate all excess holdings over a certain amount . If this was really planned , it was never carried out . 
 Ranulf often worked in concert with Haimo the dapifer , or seneschal , and Urse d 'Abetot in carrying out royal judgements . On one occasion , they , along with Robert Bloet the Bishop of Lincoln , reassessed the lands of Thorney Abbey for taxes . On another occasion , they were ordered along with Ralph de Luffa Bishop of Chichester to see that the abbey of <unk> received custody of a church at Steyning . Others who often worked with Ranulf were Robert <unk> , Roger Bigod , and Eudo the dapifer . These men are sometimes considered by historians to be the first Barons of the Exchequer . There are also signs during Ranulf 's administration of resident justices in the counties who held courts for the king . Itinerant justices were probably also used to hear pleas that were reserved to the crown . 
 While administering England for Rufus , Ranulf also supervised construction projects . Under his management , the first stone bridge in London was constructed . Ranulf also built a wall around the White Tower in London , enclosing the inner ward . A new hall at Westminster was also built , of which the outside walls of Westminster Hall are still surviving . He started building the church at Christchurch at Twynham , which he had been granted by Rufus . After Rufus ' death , the church was confiscated from Ranulf , and building work ceased . The crypts and transepts of the current church , however , date from Ranulf 's construction work . 
 = = Under Henry I = = 
 At the succession of King Henry I , the new king imprisoned Ranulf in the Tower of London on 15 August 1100 on charges of embezzlement . His custodian , William de Mandeville , allowed the bishop to escape on 3 February 1101 . Flambard was not only the first inmate of the prison , but also the first person to escape from it . A popular legend represents the bishop as descending from the window of his cell by a rope which friends had smuggled to him in a flagon of wine . Ranulf gave the wine to his guards , and after they were drunk and asleep , climbed down the rope to escape . His friends had arranged a ship to transport Ranulf , some of the bishop 's treasure , and the bishop 's elderly mother to Normandy . He took refuge across the English Channel with Henry 's brother Robert Curthose , where he became one of the duke 's principal advisors . King Henry dispossessed Ranulf of his lands at Whitsun in 1101 , and the new Archbishop of York Gerard deposed him from his bishopric . The Archbishop of Canterbury , Anselm arranged for Flambard 's trial in a papal court for simony , and a papal decree was issued against Ranulf . 
 As Robert 's advisor , he pressed the duke to dispute Henry 's claim to the crown of England . The historian David Crouch says that Ranulf " had to provide the strategic vision and energy that Duke Robert lacked " , and other historians have agreed that Ranulf 's arrival was the catalyst to Curthose 's ability to mount an invasion . Ranulf was in charge of organizing transport for the duke 's invasion of England , and also secured the defection of some of Henry 's ships , thus allowing the fleet to land safely . Robert invaded England in July 1101 along with Ranulf , but Robert agreed at the Treaty of Alton on 2 August 1101 to renounce his claim to the English throne . Although no chronicler mentions Ranulf being present at Alton , he probably was there . Ranulf was pardoned in the treaty and restored to his bishopric , but he chose to stay with Robert for five more years . Some historians , including C. W. Hollister , see the treaty as mainly Ranulf 's work , as mainly an attempt to salvage his ecclesiastical career in England , along with a displacement of Ranulf from being the chief councillor of Curthose to merely being one of many . 
 Robert rewarded Ranulf for his advice during the invasion by entrusting him with the administration of the see of Lisieux . After Robert 's defeat by Henry at Tinchebray in 1106 , the bishop was among the first to make his peace with Henry , and returned to Durham . He retired from political life . Henry had already replaced him with Roger of Salisbury an able financier who was infinitely more acceptable to the nation . Although some historians have theorized that Ranulf 's time in Normandy was as an agent of Henry , it appears that Ranulf was mainly looking out for his own interests and those of his family . 
 In 1108 , Ranulf was dragged into the middle of the ongoing dispute between Archbishop Anselm and the newly appointed Archbishop of York , Thomas over whether or not Thomas should profess obedience to Anselm . Because Anselm refused to consecrate Thomas without a profession , and Thomas refused to profess , Thomas was unable to consecrate bishops himself . Ranulf wrote to Anselm , asking that he might act as Thomas ' surrogate and consecrate Thurgot as Bishop of St Andrew 's . In September 1108 , Anselm wrote to Ranulf forbidding anyone but Thomas or Anselm himself to consecrate Thurgot or any other bishops . Later , Ranulf tried to bribe King Henry to take Thomas ' side . Thurgot had been prior of the cathedral chapter at Durham , but had disagreed with Ranulf , who arranged for him to be elected to St Andrew 's as a solution to the quarrel . 
 It was Ranulf who ordained Thurstan , the archbishop @-@ elect of York , as a priest in 1115 , although Thurstan had to wait for consecration as bishop for another four years . Ranulf attended the Council of Reims in 1119 held by Pope Callixtus II . In 1125 John of Crema , the papal legate to England , visited Durham to investigate charges against the bishop . Medieval chroniclers told the story that the legate was much taken with Ranulf 's niece , and after sleeping with the girl , took no action on the charges against Ranulf . The story is unlikely to be true . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Ranulf worked to complete the cathedral which his predecessor , William de St @-@ Calais , had begun ; fortified Durham with a wall around Durham Castle , built Norham Castle to help defend the Tweed River ; and endowed the collegiate church of Christchurch , Hampshire . He built or expanded other churches , including the one at Christchurch in Hampshire which he had endowed , and St. Martin 's in Dover . The first stone bridge at Durham was completed by his instruction in 1120 , the so @-@ called <unk> Bridge , a bridge described as " of wonderful workmanship . " He cleared and levelled the Palace Green in Durham between the castle and the cathedral . While the chroniclers mainly condemned Ranulf for his morals , his own cathedral chapter held him in high esteem because of his building activities and his defence of the rights of Durham . Although he usurped some of the income of the cathedral chapter , the money from those rights was used to complete the cathedral rebuilding , and later restored the income to the monks as well as increasing the endowment . At his death , the cathedral walls were complete up to " the covering " , which probably means the vault instead of the roof . 
 Flambard attracted scholars to his household , and reformed the administration of the diocese , by dividing it into archdeaconries . Ranulf oversaw the translation of Saint Cuthbert 's relics to a new tomb in a lavish ceremony . He was also a patron to the hermit Saint Godric , whom he befriended . 
 One of Ranulf 's brothers was Fulcher , who was Bishop of Lisieux in 1101 . Another brother was Osbern , who was a royal clerk for Rufus , and the last brother was Geoffrey . Fulcher may have been appointed bishop to enable Ranulf to exploit the see while Ranulf was in exile in Normandy . Ranulf had a son , Thomas , who also held the see of Lisieux , right after his uncle . Like his uncle , he may have been appointed as a placeholder to allow his father to appropriate the revenues of Lisieux . Ranulf 's mistress was an Englishwoman named Alveva or Ælfgifu , who was the mother of at least two of his sons . Alveva 's sons were Ranulf , who was an archdeacon , and Elias . When Ranulf became bishop , he married her to a burgess of Huntingdon , but remained on good terms with both Alveva and her spouse , often staying with them when he travelled away from Durham . Alveva was the aunt of Christina of Markyate , and Christina is said to have rebuffed the bishop 's attempts to seduce her in 1114 . Alveva and Ranulf 's son Elias held a prebend at London and was a royal clerk under Henry I. Ranulf 's son Ralf was parson of Middleham and held a prebend at London too . He was a member of Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury 's household after 1138 . Some of Ranulf 's sons were educated at Laon under William de Corbeil , who was one of Ranulf 's clerks . One of Ranulf 's nephews , Ralf , was archdeacon of Northumberland and during the reign of King Stephen helped to hold the diocese of Durham loyal to Stephen . Other nephews were Osbert , who was sheriff of Durham , and Robert , Richard , and William who held fiefs . Unrelated to Ranulf , William of Corbeil became one of Ranulf 's household clerks , and was eventually to be elected Archbishop of Canterbury in 1123 . 
 Ranulf died on 5 September 1128 . He was buried in his chapter house in Durham , where his tomb was opened in 1874 . His skeleton is still extant , and examination of it reveals that he would have been about 5 ft 9 in ( 1 @.@ 75 m ) tall . He was fond of clothes and was always richly dressed . While he was efficient in collecting the royal revenues , he was generous to his own men , and later in life gave liberally to the poor . His crozier and signet ring were found in his grave , and they were rather plain . An oddity of his grave was that he was buried on top of a layer of charcoal that was laid over alternating layers of lime and dirt . 
 Ranulf 's reputation has suffered because of the hostility of the monastic chroniclers to both himself and to Rufus . Many chroniclers decried his financial ruthlessness and his lax morals . Orderic described Ranulf 's career as " addicted to feasts and <unk> and lusts ; cruel and ambitious , prodigal to his own adherents , but rapacious in seizing the goods of other men " . Besides the chroniclers , Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury wrote to Pope Paschal II , while Ranulf was in exile , describing Ranulf as " a rent collector of the worst possible reputation . " William of Malmesbury said that Flambard was a " plunderer of the rich , destroyer of the poor " . Victorian historians , including E. A. Freeman , vilified Ranulf , and Freeman especially held that Ranulf was a " malignant genius " . Modern historians have embraced a more moderate view , starting with Richard Southern in 1933 . The historian David Bates felt that he , along with his successor Roger of Salisbury , " were essentially the chief managers of the king 's finance and justice " .

The band disbanded before the end of 1999 . After working on new material with drummer Geoff Reading , Loaded was reformed in 2001 , adding guitarist Mike Squires and Jeff Rouse to the line @-@ up , though both were briefly replaced by guitarist Dave Kushner ( Velvet Revolver , formerly of Wasted Youth and Electric Love Hogs ) and bassist George Stuart Dahlquist ( formerly of <unk> and Burning Witch ) in 2002 . 
 Following McKagan and Kushner 's involvement in " The Project " that later became Velvet Revolver , Loaded were put on hiatus , though they still played shows on occasion .

 Duff McKagan was previously a member of Guns N ' Roses from the mid @-@ 1980s to late 1990s . Guns N ' Roses achieved international success , going on to sell over 100 million albums worldwide , but the strain between singer Axl Rose and the rest of the band led to a number of members leaving or being fired , with McKagan departing in 1997 . 
 McKagan moved back to Seattle , reforming previous group 10 Minute Warning , releasing one self @-@ titled album on Sub Pop in 1998 , before recording his second solo album Beautiful Disease the same year . Featuring collaborations with former Faith No More drummer Mike Bordin , former Black Flag singer Dez Cadena and his former Guns N ' Roses band mates Slash and Izzy Stradlin , Beautiful Disease was scheduled to be released through Geffen in 1999 . McKagan formed Loaded , initially as The Gentlemen , to be his band for the tour supporting the album . With McKagan performing lead vocals and bass duties , Loaded 's line @-@ up consisted of guitarists Dez Cadena and Michael Barragan as well as drummer Taz Bentley . 
 McKagan began promoting the album ; however , following the merger between Geffen and Interscope Records , he was dropped from the label and lost all commercial rights to release the record with only a few promo copies being leaked . Loaded continued to tour and released a live album , Episode 1999 : Live , independently , which was recorded and mixed by Nick Raskulinecz . They re @-@ recorded half of Beautiful Disease and received offers from four labels . However , they disbanded before the end of the year , with McKagan and Bentley becoming part of Izzy Stradlin 's rhythm section for his tour of Japan supporting Ride On . 
 = = = Reformation and Dark Days ( 2000 – 2002 ) = = = 
 By early 2000 , McKagan had begun working on a new project with singer Mark Lanegan and drummer Geoff Reading . Though they recorded a number of songs , Lanegan left to join Queens of the Stone Age . After being convinced by Reading and Martin Feveyear to take over lead vocals , they continued to write and record new material at Jupiter Studios . With nearly an album 's worth of material recorded , they decided to re @-@ record some of the songs from Beautiful Disease to add to the material they already had . Though primarily recorded by McKagan and Reading , Dave <unk> , who joined the band as bassist , and Mike Squires recorded additional drums , while Feveyear , who also produced the album , recorded additional keyboards . 
 The resulting album , titled Dark Days , was released in the United States and Japan in July 2001 , through Artistdirect and EMI , while it was released in Europe , through Locomotive Music , a year later . Rather than releasing the album under his own name , McKagan readopted the Loaded moniker . They announced three dates at the House of Blues taking place in Anaheim , California , Las Vegas , Nevada , and West Hollywood , California ( where they were joined onstage by Slash ) in November 2001 , adding Mike Squires and Jeff Rouse , who replaced <unk> , to the lineup on lead and bass guitar , respectively , while Feveyear performed keyboards and percussion . Loaded played more shows in the US ( where they were joined on stage by Billy Duffy and Matt Sorum during a show in Los Angeles ) before going on to tour Japan . They toured Japan as part of Fire Wire , supporting J and Zilch , where McKagan first met guitarist Dave Kushner , who was , then , the Zilch guitarist . 
 Following the tour , Rouse and Squires departed the band when Alien Crime Syndicate signed with V2 Records for the re @-@ release of their latest album . Loaded enlisted Dave Kushner and George Stuart Dahlquist and announced a tour of Europe , playing shows in the Netherlands , Germany , France , Italy , and Spain , as well as shows in the UK .

 After performing at a benefit gig for Randy Castillo in 2002 , McKagan began collaborating with his former Guns N ' Roses band mates , Slash and Matt Sorum , on a new project . Because of this , Loaded 's tour of Europe was cancelled . Loaded played a show at Hollywood 's Viper Room , where afterwards , McKagan introduced Kushner to Slash , who were previously friends in junior high and high school . Kushner was invited to play with the group and soon after became a member of " The Project " which , after auditioning a number of singers , became known as Velvet Revolver following the addition of Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland to the line @-@ up . Loaded were effectively put on hiatus . However , they would still continue to play shows on occasion , though they did not play together again until December 2006 for the benefit show for Jerry Allen 's Cancer Fund , with both Squires and Rouse returning to the group . 
 During the hiatus , the Loaded members continued to work on various projects . Reading formed the group The Disciples ( that later became The Chelsea Smiles ) with Christian <unk> , Todd Youth , and Howie Pyro . Rouse would release another album with Alien Crime Syndicate , titled Ten Songs in the Key of Betrayal , who went on the perform as Tommy Stinson 's backing band in support of his solo album Village Gorilla Head . Following the tour , Rouse joined Vendetta Red , replacing previous bassist Michael Vermillion , on their tour in support of their latest album Sisters of the Red Death . However , they disbanded in March 2006 , with Rouse and former Vendetta Red members Zach Davidson and Leif Andersen , as well as local drummer Ben <unk> , forming the group Sirens Sister . They released one album in 2006 , before Rouse left the group in 2007 .

 While on tour with Velvet Revolver in 2008 , McKagan stated that Loaded were to release a new album in the summer and were to enter the studio in April . Soon after the end of their tour , Velvet Revolver announced the departure of Weiland , putting the group on hiatus until they find a new singer . Previously , the Loaded members worked on material by sending mp3 files to each other . 
 They rented a rehearsal space and began working on the new material before going on to record the album at Jupiter Studios with producer Martin Feveyear . They released a series of <unk> during this time , featuring footage from the recording sessions for the group 's new album . They booked a tour of the UK and Ireland and were added to the lineups of few European festivals . The album was completed in less than two weeks and cost only $ 20 @,@ 000 . 
 Loaded subsequently signed a deal with Century Media and , at the suggestion of the label , voted to change the name of the group to Duff McKagan 's Loaded , stating that " [ they could ] always just turn it back to Loaded once [ they ] get [ their ] foot in the door . " The album 's release was pushed back to 2009 . However , to coincide with their European Tour , an EP entitled Wasted Heart was released on September 22 , 2008 . They released a music video for the song " No More " for the EP release . 
 Loaded 's second album , Sick , was released on March 20 , 2009 in Europe and April 7 in the US , peaking at number 43 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart . Sick sold 1 @,@ 400 copies in the first week , while " Flatline " was chosen as the first single to go to radio . The album received generally positive reviews , with Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stating " Loaded is the sound of a working band working and an old rocker staying sober , kicking out some lead @-@ heavy grooves and sculptured pieces of sleaze . " 
 In support of Sick , Loaded played a number of shows in the United States , South America , and Europe , while also appearing at a number of festivals such as Download in the UK , Rock am Ring and Rock im Park in Germany , Rockfest in the United States , and the Sauna Open Air Festival in Finland . They also opened for Mötley Crüe and Black Stone Cherry on their tours of Europe . At a number of shows , Loaded were joined onstage by other musicians such as Ron " <unk> " Thal ( Guns N ' Roses ) , Corey Taylor ( Slipknot and Stone Sour ) , and Michael Monroe ( formerly of Hanoi Rocks ) . 
 In September 2009 , Reading departed the group and was replaced by Isaac Carpenter formerly of Gosling and The <unk> . In the middle of touring , McKagan posted an update on his Twitter stating that the group will " be writing new songs tonight and tomorrow . " He added , " Some great ideas and riffs have come on this latest <unk> excited , for sure ! " 
 In December , Loaded , along with Queensrÿche , were confirmed at the " KISW Salutes the Shield " benefit show that took place on December 19 at the Snoqualmie Casino in Snoqualmie , Washington where , during the show , they were joined on stage by Queensrÿche singer Geoff Tate .

 In February 2010 , Loaded parted ways with Century Media and began looking for a new label , having already written and demoed new material . The same month , both McKagan and Rouse performed at the Hootenanny For Haiti at the Showbox at the Market in Seattle with Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready and Fastbacks bassist Kim <unk> , as well as Truly and former Screaming Trees drummer Mark Pickerel , among others . 
 While Loaded were briefly inactive , guitarist Mike Squires performed with Green Apple Quick Step on a few occasions and McKagan began writing and recording with Jane 's Addiction . McKagan was confirmed as a permanent member of the group , in April , performing at shows in the United States and Europe . His tenure with the band only lasted five months , with his departure from the group announced on September 6 . In a statement , the band commented : " We wanted to thank Duff for helping us write songs for our new record . We love the songs we worked on with him — and the gigs were a blast — but musically we were all headed in different directions . From here Duff is off to work on his own stuff so we wish him all the best " . 
 During his time with Jane 's Addiction , McKagan stated that they were writing material for their new album , while he also stated that " Loaded will <unk> be something I do . It is more a way of life and a way to express music and have a fucking blast with those guys than anything else . " Loaded entered the studio in August with Terry Date , who had approached the band about producing their album , and they completed it by the beginning of September . 
 A new song by the band entitled " We Win " is being used by ESPN and Major League Baseball for their coverage of the American League Championship Series , the National League Championship Series , and the World Series . They also signed a deal with Eagle Rock Entertainment for the release of their new album , titled The Soundtrack , to be released on March 22 , 2011 , and the label is also re @-@ releasing their previous album , Sick , in April of the same year . It was later revealed in interviews with guitarist Mike Squires and filmmaker Jamie Burton Chamberlin that the album title was changed to The Taking and was to be released on April 19 . The band are also collaborating with filmmaker and documentarian Jamie Burton Chamberlin on a film based on the album . Chamberlin stated that the film would be more " about designing a fictitious story line which will be a part of the larger project , and will be a contemporary version of , say , Hard Days Night meets ( Led Zeppelin 's ) Song Remains the Same , with aspects of documentary , music video , and live performance , all interconnected by an underlying motivation " and that the " album will serve as the soundtrack . " Chamberlin filmed Loaded at the Seattle Seahawks Veterans Day half @-@ time show on November 7 . 
 The film is to feature a number of cameos from various musicians , including John Roderick of The Long Winters , Chris <unk> of The Presidents of the United States of America , Soundgarden members Ben Shepherd and Kim Thayil , and Lemmy of Motörhead . Shooting locations for the film include Seattle , with the band planning to perform unannounced acoustic shows for filming , and Los Angeles .

 The Taking was released on April 18 , 2011 in Europe and April 19 in the US , and charted at number 12 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart , selling over 2 @,@ 300 copies in the first week . They released a video for the song " Dead Skin , " directed by Chamberlin , and the album received positive reviews . Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars stating that McKagan " turns in his hardest record in recent memory " and that the album " does make a brute impression [ ... ] playing with a vitality that almost compensates for how they fetishize the past .

 = = History = = 
 Denver City was founded in November 1858 as a mining town during the Pike 's Peak Gold Rush in western Kansas Territory . That summer , a group of gold prospectors from Lawrence , Kansas , had arrived and established Montana City on the banks of the South Platte River . This was the first settlement in what was later to become the city of Denver . The site faded quickly , however , and by the summer of 1859 it was abandoned in favor of Auraria ( named after the gold mining town of Auraria , Georgia ) , and St. Charles City . 
 On November 22 , 1858 , General William Larimer , a land speculator from eastern Kansas Territory , placed cottonwood logs to stake a claim on the bluff overlooking the confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek , across the creek from the existing mining settlement of Auraria , and on the site of the existing townsite of St. Charles . Larimer named the town site Denver City to curry favor with Kansas Territorial Governor James W. Denver . Larimer hoped that the town 's name would help make it the county seat of Arapaho County , but unknown to him Governor Denver had already resigned from office . The location was accessible to existing trails and was across the South Platte River from the site of seasonal encampments of the Cheyenne and Arapaho . The site of these first towns is now the site of Confluence Park near downtown Denver . Larimer , along with associates in the St. Charles City Land Company , sold parcels in the town to merchants and miners , with the intention of creating a major city that would cater to new emigrants . Denver City was a frontier town , with an economy based on servicing local miners with gambling , saloons , livestock and goods trading . In the early years , land parcels were often traded for <unk> or gambled away by miners in Auraria . In May 1859 , Denver City residents donated 53 lots to the Leavenworth & Pike 's Peak Express in order to secure the region 's first overland wagon route . Offering daily service for " passengers , mail , freight , and gold , " the Express reached Denver on a trail that trimmed westward travel time from twelve days to six . In 1863 , Western Union furthered Denver 's dominance of the region by choosing the city for its regional terminus . 
 The Colorado Territory was created on February 28 , 1861 , Arapahoe County was formed on November 1 , 1861 , and Denver City was incorporated on November 7 , 1861 . Denver City served as the Arapahoe County Seat from 1861 until consolidation in 1902 . In 1867 , Denver City became the Territorial Capital . With its new @-@ found importance , Denver City shortened its name to Denver . On August 1 , 1876 , Colorado was admitted to the Union . 
 Although by the close of the 1860s , Denver residents could look with pride at their success establishing a vibrant supply and service center , the decision to route the nation 's first transcontinental railroad through Cheyenne , rather than Denver , threatened the prosperity of the young town . A daunting 100 miles away , citizens mobilized to build a railroad to connect Denver to the transcontinental railroad . Spearheaded by visionary leaders including Territorial Governor John Evans , David Moffat , and Walter Cheesman , fundraising began . Within three days , $ 300 @,@ 000 had been raised , and citizens were optimistic . Fundraising stalled before enough was raised , forcing these visionary leaders to take control of the debt @-@ ridden railroad . Despite challenges , on June 24 , 1870 , citizens cheered as the Denver Pacific completed the link to the transcontinental railroad , ushering in a new age of prosperity for Denver . 
 Finally linked to the rest of the nation by rail , Denver prospered as a service and supply center . The young city grew during these years , attracting millionaires with their mansions , as well as the poverty and crime of a rapidly growing city . Denver citizens were proud when the rich chose Denver and were thrilled that Horace Tabor , the Leadville mining millionaire , built an impressive business block at 16th and Larimer as well as the elegant Tabor Grand Opera House . Luxurious hotels , including the much @-@ loved Brown Palace Hotel , soon followed , as well as splendid homes for millionaires like the Croke , Patterson , Campbell Mansion at 11th and Pennsylvania and the now @-@ demolished Moffat Mansion at 8th and Grant . Intent on transforming Denver into one of the world 's great cities , leaders wooed industry and enticed laborers to work in these factories . Soon , in addition to the elite and a large middle class , Denver had a growing population of German , Italian , and Chinese laborers , soon followed by African @-@ Americans and Spanish @-@ surname workers . Unprepared for this influx , the Silver Crash of 1893 unsettled political , social , and economic balances , laying the foundation for ethnic bigotry , such as the Red Scare and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan , as well as corruption and crime . 
 Between 1880 and 1895 the city experienced a huge rise in corruption , as crime bosses , such as Soapy Smith , worked side by side with elected officials and the police to control elections , gambling , and the <unk> gangs . The city also experienced a depression in 1893 after the crash of silver prices . In 1887 , the precursor to the international charity United Way was formed in Denver by local religious leaders who raised funds and coordinated various charities to help Denver 's poor . By 1890 , Denver had grown to be the second @-@ largest city west of Omaha , Nebraska . In 1900 , whites represented 96 @.@ 8 % of Denver 's population . 
 Between the 1880s and 1930s , Denver 's floriculture industry developed and thrived . This period became known locally as the Carnation Gold Rush . 
 In 1901 , the Colorado General Assembly voted to split Arapahoe County into three parts : a new consolidated City and County of Denver , a new Adams County , and the remainder of the Arapahoe County to be renamed South Arapahoe County . A ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court , subsequent legislation , and a referendum delayed the creation of the City and County of Denver until November 15 , 1902 . 
 Denver has hosted the Democratic National Convention twice , during the years of 1908 , and again in 2008 , taking the opportunity to promote the city 's status on the national , political , and socioeconomic stage . 
 Early in the 20th century , Denver , like many other cities , was home to a pioneering Brass Era car company . The Colburn Automobile Company made cars copied from the contemporary Renault . 
 From 1953 to 1989 , the Rocky Flats Plant , a DOE nuclear weapon facility formerly located about 15 miles from Denver , produced fissile plutonium " pits " for nuclear warheads . A major fire at the facility in 1957 , as well as leakage from nuclear waste stored at the site between 1958 and 1968 , resulted in the contamination of some parts of Denver , to varying degrees , with plutonium @-@ 239 , a harmful radioactive substance with a half @-@ life of 24 @,@ 200 years . A study by the Jefferson County health director , Dr. Carl Johnson , in 1981 linked the contamination to an increase in birth defects and cancer incidence in central Denver and nearer Rocky Flats . Later studies confirmed many of his findings . Plutonium contamination was still present outside the former plant site as of August 2010 , and presents risks to building the envisioned Jefferson Parkway , which would complete Denver 's automotive beltway . 
 Denver was selected in 1970 to host the 1976 Winter Olympics to coincide with Colorado 's centennial celebration , but in November 1972 Colorado voters struck down ballot initiatives allocating public funds to pay for the high costs of the games , which were subsequently moved to Innsbruck , Austria . The notoriety of becoming the only city ever to decline to host an Olympiad after being selected has made subsequent bids difficult . The movement against hosting the games was based largely on environmental issues and was led by State Representative Richard Lamm , who was subsequently elected to three terms ( 1975 – 87 ) as Colorado governor . Denver explored a potential bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics , but no bid will be submitted . In 2010 , Denver adopted a comprehensive update of its zoning code . The new zoning was developed to guide development as envisioned in adopted plans such as Blueprint Denver , Transit Oriented Development Strategic Plan , <unk> Denver , and the Strategic Transportation Plan . 
 Denver has also been known historically as the Queen City of the Plains and the Queen City of the West , because of its important role in the agricultural industry of the high @-@ plains region in eastern Colorado and along the foothills of the Colorado Front Range . Several US Navy ships have been named USS Denver in honor of the city . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Denver is located in the center of the Front Range Urban Corridor , between the Rocky Mountains to the west and the High Plains to the east . Denver 's topography consists of plains in the city center with hilly areas to the north , west and south . According to the United States Census Bureau the city has a total area of 155 square miles ( 401 km2 ) , of which 153 square miles ( 396 km2 ) is land and 1 @.@ 6 square miles ( 4 @.@ 1 km2 ) ( 1 @.@ 1 % ) is water . The City and County of Denver is surrounded by only three other counties : Adams County to the north and east , Arapahoe County to the south and east , and Jefferson County to the west . 
 Although Denver 's nickname is the " Mile @-@ High City " because its official elevation is one mile above sea level , defined by the elevation of the spot of a benchmark on the steps of the State Capitol building , the elevation of the entire city ranges from 5 @,@ 130 to 5 @,@ 690 feet ( 1 @,@ 560 to 1 @,@ 730 m ) . According to Geographic Names Information System ( GNIS ) and the National Elevation <unk> , the city 's elevation is 5 @,@ 278 feet ( 1 @,@ 609 m ) , which is reflected on various websites such as that of the National Weather Service . 
 = = = Neighborhoods = = = 
 As of January 2013 , the City and County of Denver has defined 78 official neighborhoods that the city and community groups use for planning and administration . Although the city 's delineation of the neighborhood boundaries is somewhat arbitrary , it corresponds roughly to the definitions used by residents . These " neighborhoods " should not be confused with cities or suburbs , which may be separate entities within the metro area . 
 The character of the neighborhoods varies significantly from one to another and includes everything from large skyscrapers to houses from the late 19th century to modern , suburban style developments . Generally , the neighborhoods closest to the city center are denser , older and contain more brick building material . Many neighborhoods away from the city center were developed after World War II , and are built with more modern materials and style . Some of the neighborhoods even farther from the city center , or recently redeveloped parcels anywhere in the city have either very suburban characteristics or are new urbanist developments that attempt to recreate the feel of older neighborhoods . Most neighborhoods contain parks or other features that are the focal point for the neighborhood . 
 Denver does not have larger area designations , unlike the City of Chicago , which has larger areas that house the neighborhoods ( IE : Northwest Side ) . Denver residents use the terms " north " " south " " east " and " west " . 
 Denver also has a number of neighborhoods not reflected in the administrative boundaries . These neighborhoods may reflect the way people in an area identify themselves or they might reflect how others , such as real estate developers , have defined those areas . Well @-@ known non @-@ administrative neighborhoods include the historic and trendy LoDo ( short for " Lower Downtown " ) , part of the city 's Union Station neighborhood ; Uptown , straddling North Capitol Hill and City Park West ; Curtis Park , part of the Five Points neighborhood ; Alamo <unk> , the northern part of the Speer neighborhood ; Park Hill , a successful example of intentional racial integration ; and Golden Triangle , in the Civic Center .

 = = = Climate = = = 
 Denver lies within the semi @-@ arid , continental climate zone ( Köppen climate classification BSk ) . It has four distinct seasons and receives a modest amount of precipitation spread through the year . Due to its inland location on the High Plains , at the foot of the Rocky Mountains , Denver , like all cities along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains , is subject to sudden changes in weather . Denver can typically count on having about 115 clear days , 130 partly cloudy days and 120 cloudy days each year . July is the warmest month , with a daily average temperature of 74 @.@ 2 ° F ( 23 @.@ 4 ° C ) . Summers range from mild to hot with occasional afternoon thunderstorms and high temperatures reaching 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) on 38 days annually , and occasionally 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) . December , the coldest month of the year , has a daily average temperature of 29 @.@ 9 ° F ( − 1 @.@ 2 ° C ) . Winters range from mild to occasional bitter cold , consisting of periods of snow and very low temperatures alternating with periods of relatively milder weather . In winter , highs can reach up to 75 ° F ( 24 ° C ) , but can also sometimes be below 0 ° F ( − 18 ° C ) . Snowfall is common throughout the late fall , winter and early spring , averaging 53 @.@ 5 inches ( 136 cm ) for 1981 – 2010 . The average window for measurable ( ≥ 0 @.@ 1 in or 0 @.@ 25 cm ) snow is October 17 through April 27 although measurable snowfall has fallen in Denver as early as September 4 and as late as June 3 . Extremes in temperature range from − 29 ° F ( − 34 ° C ) on January 9 , 1875 up to 105 ° F ( 41 ° C ) as recently as June 25 and 26 , 2012 . Tornadoes are rare in Denver , though one notable exception was an F3 tornado that struck 4 @.@ 4 miles south of downtown on June 15 , 1988 . However , the eastern suburbs of Denver , and the city 's east @-@ northeastern extension which is the Denver International Airport , can see a few small tornadoes in the spring and summer months , especially during June in the Denver Convergence Vorticity Zone ( DCVZ ) . The DCVZ , also known as the Denver Cyclone , is a variable vortex of storm @-@ forming air flow usually found north and east of downtown , and which often includes the airport . Heavy weather from the DCVZ can disrupt airport operations . In a study looking at hail events in areas with a population of at least 50 @,@ 000 , Denver was found to be ranked 10th most prone to hail storms in the continental United States . 
 Based on 30 @-@ year averages obtained from NOAA 's National Climatic Data Center for the months of December , January and February , Weather Channel ranked Denver the 18th coldest major U.S. city as of 2014 .
