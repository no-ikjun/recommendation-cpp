 = Tropical Storm Patricia ( 2009 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Patricia was a short @-@ lived tropical cyclone that briefly affected parts of Baja California Sur before rapidly degenerating over water . Developing from a tropical wave that traversed the Atlantic Ocean during September 2009 , Patricia was first classified as a tropical depression on October 11 several hundred miles south of the Baja California Peninsula . The system quickly intensified into a tropical storm as it tracked in a general northward direction . By October 12 , Patricia attained its peak intensity with winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 996 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 41 inHg ) . The following day , increasing wind shear and unfavorable conditions caused the storm to rapidly weaken . By the morning of October 14 , Patricia had degenerated into a non @-@ convective remnant low pressure area near the southern coastline of Baja California Sur . The remnants of the storm persisted until October 15 , at which time they dissipated over open waters . 
 Although the center of Patricia did not impact land , the outer bands caused significant rainfall in portions of western Mexico . In Sonora , up to 240 mm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) of rain fell , leading to significant flooding that left 600 people homeless . Other Mexican states received similar impact . Overall , the effects of Patricia were minor and resulted in no loss of life . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Tropical Storm Patricia originated from a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on September 23 , 2009 . Two days later , Tropical Depression Eight developed from the wave over the eastern Atlantic Ocean . The depression tracked northwestward , while the wave continued a steady westward track . By October 6 , the system crossed Central America and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean . Gradual development took place over the following several days with widespread , scattered convection consolidating around a developing area of low pressure . On October 11 , a well @-@ defined circulation had formed and the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) estimated that it developed into a tropical depression roughly 405 mi ( 650 km ) south @-@ southeast of the southern tip of Baja California Sur . 
 Several hours later , the system further strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Patricia . The low @-@ level circulation became embedded within very deep convection and further intensification was anticipated . Patricia tracked north @-@ northwest in a region of low to moderate wind shear , under the steering currents of a strong ridge of high pressure to the east and a trough located northwest . Although over warm sea surface temperatures , relatively stable air prevented substantial intensification . By the late morning of October 12 , the overall extent of cloud cover had increased but the center became less defined , described as " sloppy " by NHC forecaster Todd <unk> . Later that day , Patricia attained its peak intensity as a moderately strong tropical storm with winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 996 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 41 inHg ) . 
 The storm maintained this intensity for several hours as its central dense overcast remained intact despite increasing wind shear . However , the NHC stated that there was a 20 % chance of the storm becoming a hurricane within 24 hours based on climatological factors and the average forecast intensity errors . However , this did not take place . The combination of moderate wind shear and a stable environment caused Patricia to rapidly weaken on October 13 . The storm 's cirrus outflow became weak in all directions and convection diminished . Later that day , convective developed ceased to occur as the storm neared the south tip of Baja California Sur . Early on October 14 , Patricia degenerated into a remnant low pressure area , bypassing tropical depression status , roughly 30 mi ( 50 km ) south of the Baja California Peninsula . The remnant low turned westward and tracked over open waters before dissipating on October 15 . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Several hours after Patricia was classified as a tropical storm on October 12 , the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch for areas along Baja California Sur between La Paz and Santa Fe . The following day , the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for areas between Buenavista and Agua Blanca . However , the storm 's rapid decay on October 14 allowed the watches and warnings to be discontinued . Officials in the threatened region began preparing by closing schools and opening 159 shelters on October 12 . The Civil Protection Department was prepared to evacuate residents in low @-@ lying area if necessary . Resorts and hotels cancelled all outdoor activities and brought all loose objects indoors . The city of Los Cabos was placed under a state of emergency as flooding rains were forecast to impact the area . Ports in the region were also shut down due to rough seas . 
 The storm 's quick deterioration led to significantly less impact than anticipated . High waves affected the coastlines of Baja California Sur , Sinaloa and Nayarit . Parts of Sinaloa also recorded heavy rainfall from Patricia , peaking at 184 @.@ 5 mm ( 7 @.@ 26 in ) in Higuera de Zaragoza . Subsequent flooding was reported in 12 municipalities in the state , resulting in the evacuation of 3 @,@ 000 people . Officials also closed elementary schools throughout the affected area due to the anticipation of flood waters . In southern Sonora , rainfall up to 240 mm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) led to widespread flooding . Officials reported that 181 people sought refuge in shelters . Additionally , relief agencies supplied 500 people with food during the storm . A total of 2 @,@ 272 hectares ( 5 @,@ 614 acres ) of agricultural land was inundated by flood waters . Roughly 815 people were left homeless in the wake of the storm , 600 of whom were in Sonora . 
 = Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary = 
 Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary is a comic @-@ book story by American cartoonist Justin Green , published in 1972 . Green takes the persona of Binky Brown to tell of the " compulsive neurosis " with which he struggled in his youth and which he blamed on his strict Roman Catholic upbringing . Green was later diagnosed with obsessive – compulsive disorder ( OCD ) and came to see his problems in that light . 
 In the story , sinful thoughts that he cannot control torment Binky Brown ; to his alarm , phallic objects become literal penises and project what he calls " pecker rays " at religious objects such as churches and statues of the Virgin Mary . He develops an internal set of rules to obey and punishments for breaking them . The torment does not subside , and he comes to reject the Catholic Church in defiance as the source of it . The work combines a wide variety of visual and narrative techniques in a style that echoes the torment of its protagonist . 
 Binky Brown had an immediate influence on contemporaries in underground comix : such cartoonists as Aline <unk> , Robert Crumb , and Art Spiegelman soon turned to producing similarly confessional works . Binky Brown has gained a reputation as the first major work of autobiography in English @-@ language comics , and many aspects of its approach have become widespread in underground and alternative comics . 
 = = Background = = 
 Justin Green ( b . 1945 ) was born to a Jewish father and Catholic mother and raised Catholic . As a child he at first attended a Catholic parochial school , and later transferred to a school where most students were Jews . He rejected the Catholic faith in 1958 as he believed it caused him " compulsive neurosis " that decades later was diagnosed as obsessive – compulsive disorder ( OCD ) . 
 Green was studying painting at the Rhode Island School of Design when in 1967 he discovered the work of Robert Crumb and turned to cartooning , attracted to what he called Crumb 's " harsh drawing stuffed into <unk> @-@ drawn panels " . He experimented with his artwork to find what he called an " inherent and automatic style as a conduit for the chimerical forms in [ his ] own psyche " . He dropped out of an MFA program at Syracuse University when in 1968 he felt a " call to arms " to move to San Francisco , where the nascent underground comix scene was blossoming amid the counterculture there . 
 At the time , comic books had a reputation in the US as low @-@ brow children 's entertainment , and the public often associated them with juvenile delinquency . Comics had little cultural capital and few American cartoonists had challenged the perception that the medium was inherently incapable of mature artistic expression . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Green takes the persona of Binky Brown , who opens the story writing a confession of the neurosis that has tortured him since puberty . In his childhood , he knocks over a statue of the Virgin Mary and feels intense guilt over this affront to his mother and to God . Binky is raised a Catholic and undergoes the religious indoctrination of nuns at a strict Catholic parochial school that commonly employs corporal punishment . He forms an image of a vengeful God , which fills him with feelings of fear and guilt . 
 Binky 's intrusive thoughts bring him to believe his body is trying to lead him to sin and eternal punishment . He develops an internal system of rules to cope with these thoughts and punishes himself for violations . He wards off thoughts and fantasies he cannot control and that give him guilt by silently repeating the word " <unk> " to himself , a contraction of the repentant " not a sin " . 
 As he approaches adolescence and becomes aware of his sexuality , he begins to see common objects as phalluses — phalluses that project unholy rays . These objects include his fingers , his toes , and his own penis , and he obsessively tries to deflect their " pecker rays " from reaching holy items such as churches or statues of Mary . Binky finds his anguish all @-@ consuming as he imagines the destruction he cannot avoid , and spends hours praying to God for forgiveness . As an adult , Binky confronts his faith and by smashing a set of statues of the Virgin Mary declares himself free of the Church and its influence on him . 
 = = Composition and publication = = 
 Green spent about a year working on the 44 @-@ page Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary . He took a few months making cards of what he called " factual incidents or neurotic habits " to incorporate . During the seven months he drew the work Green received a monthly stipend of $ 150 from Ron Turner , the founder of underground comix publisher Last Gasp Eco @-@ Funnies . Last Gasp published the story as a one @-@ shot comic book in 1972 — Green 's first solo title . It went through two print runs of 55 @,@ 000 copies each with a " Youngsters Prohibited " label on the cover . 
 In 1990 , Green had an essay published entitled " The Binky Brown Matter " in The Sun . In the essay , he describes the OCD with which he was diagnosed years after completing Binky Brown . Last Gasp reprinted the story in 1995 in The Binky Brown Sampler , a softcover anthology of Binky Brown strips with an introduction by Art Spiegelman and an expanded version of " The Binky Brown Matter " . 
 Green sold the original artwork to the strip in the 1970s ; McSweeney 's staff contacted the owner of the artwork , Christine Valenza , to make fresh scans for a standalone reprinting in 2009 , overseen by McSweeney 's editor Eli Horowitz . It had a print run of 5 @,@ 000 copies and reprints the artwork at the full size of the originals ; the page reproductions mimic the actual pages , including marks , smudges , and corrections . In 2011 , the publisher Stara published a French translation by Harry Morgan titled Binky Brown <unk> la Vierge Marie , and La <unk> published a Spanish translation by Francisco Pérez Navarro titled Binky Brown <unk> a la <unk> María .

 The story takes the form of a guilt @-@ ridden confession . In the opening , the adult Binky hangs over a sickle , bound from head to toe and listening to Ave Maria as he draws with a pen in his mouth . He declares his intention : " to purge myself of the compulsive neurosis which I have served since I officially left Catholicism on Halloween , 1958 . " He justifies the work to communicate with the " many others [ who ] are slaves to their neuroses " and who , despite believing themselves isolated , number so many that they " would entwine the globe many times over in a vast chain of common suffering " . 
 Though Green built Binky Brown on an autobiographical base he fabricated many scenes — such as one in which Binky is bullied by two third @-@ graders — " to suggest or convey a whole generalized idea about some subjective feeling , such as order or fear or guilt " . To critic Charles Hatfield Binky Brown displays a " radical subjectivity " that calls into question the notion of objectivity in autobiography . The presentation is insistently subjective and non @-@ literal in its visuals . 
 Despite the heavy tone , humor is prominent . The work is conscious of its own creation — Green 's drawing of it frames the narrative proper and there are constant reminders of it throughout . Green patterned the opening after those featuring the Crypt @-@ Keeper in EC Comics ' Tales from the Crypt series from the 1950s . Green used the adult Binky as the narrator of the captions and as a way to tie together the past and present timeframes . There is a disconnect in that the narrator refers to his younger self as " he " . Other references to comics include a <unk> 's Guidebook , which alludes to Dick Tracy 's <unk> 's Textbook and a cartoon by Robert Crumb in the background . 
 Green employs numerous Catholic symbols , such as a word balloon adorned with symbols of Christ 's martyrdom to represent the depth of Binky 's desperation . Catholic works such as a catechism and Treasure Chest parochial comics appear throughout the work . 
 Despite strict censorship in other media in the US , explicit sexuality was common in underground comix . Binky Brown was the first work of autobiographical comics to depict explicit sexuality : penises appear throughout , and Binky masturbates in one scene . The central symbol of the penis recurs sometimes subtly as in the images of pencils used to craft the work , and more often explicitly , as every phallic @-@ like object Green sees because a literal " pecker ray " <unk> penis in Binky 's mind . 
 Art Spiegelman described the artwork as " quirky and ungainly " . Though it appears awkward , Green put considerable effort into elements such as graphical perspective , and draws attention to his craft by depicting himself drawing and by placing the drawing manuals Perspective and Fun With a Pencil in the backgrounds . Green makes wide use of visual metaphors , in contrast to the mundane tales of Harvey Pekar , another prominent early practitioner of autobiographical comics . In Binky Brown symbols become literal , as when Binky imagines himself becoming a snowball hurtling into Hell or as a fish chased by a police officer who wears a crucifix . The work displays a wide array of visual techniques : diagrammatic arrows ; mock @-@ scholarly documentation ; a great variety in panel size , composition , and layout ; and a range of contrasting mechanical and organic rendering techniques , such as screentone alongside dense hand @-@ drawn hatching . The symbolic and technical collide where the Virgin Mary becomes the vanishing point of Binky 's converging " pecker rays " . 
 Critic Joseph Witek sees the shifting between different modes of traditional comics representation at times presents a literalist view through " <unk> panels " , and at others " representational , symbolic , allegorical , associative , and allusive " , an approach analogous to " Binky Brown 's massively and chaotically overdetermined subjectivity " . Witek finds roots for the fractured psychological landscape of Binky Brown in the comics of earlier eras : the unrestrained psyches in the dreams of Winsor McCay 's Dream of the Rarebit Fiend , the irrational , shifting landscapes of George Herriman 's Krazy Kat , and Superman 's obsessively contrarian nemesis Bizarro . 
 In Binky Brown Green blames the Catholic Church for his psychological troubles ; years later , he was diagnosed with OCD , and came to see these episodes in that light rather than as the fault of the Church . He nevertheless continued to blame the Church for contributing to his anxieties and maintained that religion has a magnifying influence on the condition . He said the abandoning of both religion and recreational drugs made it easier to cope with his condition . In 1990 a Catholic priest raised concerns that Binky Brown may be harmful to minors ; Green countered that he believed it was the Church that was harming minors . Green has likened his OCD to a " split vision " which made him " both the slave to the compulsion and the detached observer " . 
 Literary scholar Hillary Chute sees the work as addressing feminist concerns of " embodiment and representation " as it " delves into and forcefully pictures non @-@ normative sexuality " . Chute affirms that despite its brevity Binky Brown merits the label " graphic novel " as " the quality of work , its approach , parameters , and sensibility " mark a " seriousness of purpose " . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Green recounted " a strong energy " that Binky Brown drew from his readership , the first significant response he got from his work . The story has had a wide influence on underground and alternative comics , where its self @-@ mocking and confessional approach has inspired numerous cartoonists to expose intimate and embarrassing details of their lives . Under the influence of Binky Brown , in 1972 Aline <unk> published her first strip , the autobiographical " Goldie : A Neurotic Woman " in <unk> 's Comix # 1 . Other contemporary underground cartoonists were soon to incorporate confessional autobiography into their work . Robert Crumb followed the same year with " The Confessions of R. Crumb " and continued with numerous other such strips . Art Spiegelman , who had seen Binky Brown in mid @-@ creation in 1971 , went as far as to state that " without Binky Brown there would be no Maus " — Spiegelman 's most prominent work . The same year as Binky Brown 's publication , Green asked Spiegelman to contribute a three @-@ page strip to the first issue of Funny Aminals , which Green edited . Spiegelman delivered the three @-@ page " Maus " in which Nazi cats persecute Jewish mice , inspired by his father 's experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp ; years later he revisited the theme in the graphic novel of the same name . Comics critic Jared Gardner asserts that , while underground comix was associated with countercultural iconoclasm , the movement 's most enduring legacy was to be autobiography . 
 The strip went out of print for two decades after selling its initial print runs , during which time enthusiasts traded copies or photocopies . Rather than through cartooning , Green made his living painting signs , and contributed occasional cartoon strips to various publications . Aside from occasional one @-@ off strips , his more regular cartooning appeared in the ongoing strips The Sign Game in Signs of the Times magazine and Musical Legends in America in Pulse ! Such later work has attracted far less attention than Binky Brown . 
 Though autobiographical elements had appeared earlier in the work of underground cartoonists such as Crumb , Spain , and Kim Deitch , Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary has gained credit as the first important work of autobiographical comics in English . To Charles Hatfield Binky Brown " the ur @-@ example of confessional literature in comics " ; for Paul Gravett Green was " the first neurotic visionary to unburden his uncensored psychological troubles " ; Douglas Wolk declared Green and his work " ahead of the memoirist curve " ; Art Spiegelman declared : " What the Brontë sisters did for Gothic romance , what Tolkien did for sword @-@ and @-@ sorcery , Justin Green did for <unk> , autobiographical comix [ sic ] " ; and Publishers Weekly called the work the " Rosetta Stone of autobiographical comics " . Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary strip has appealed mostly to comics fans and cartoonists and has gained little recognition from mainstream audiences and arts critics . Spiegelman has speculated this neglect comes from the nature of the comics medium ; in contrast to explicit works such as Philip Roth 's Portnoy 's Complaint , the penises in Green 's work are visual . 
 According to underground comix historian Patrick <unk> , Green represents a break with past convention by being " the first to openly render his personal demons and emotional conflicts within the confines of a comic " . Green denied credit , calling confessional autobiography " a fait accompli , a low fruit ripe for the plucking " , examples of which abounded in literary works he had read by James Joyce , James T. Farrell , and Philip Roth . He has accepted credit for " <unk> [ ing ] the groundswell in literature about obsessive compulsive disorder by almost two decades " , for which he knew of no precedent . Green used the Binky Brown persona over the years in short strips and prose pieces that appeared in underground periodicals such as Arcade and Weirdo . " Sweet Void of Youth " in 1976 follows Binky from high school to age thirty @-@ one , torn between cartooning and more respected forms of art . 
 To cartoonist Jim Woodring , Green 's autobiographical work " has never been surpassed " . Woodring 's own autobiographical work in Jim draws from his dreams rather than his waking life . British @-@ American cartoonist Gabrielle Bell sympathized with Brown 's approach , which she described as " talking about his feelings or his emotional state when he was illustrating it with striking images that were sort of absurd or a weird juxtaposition " . Green 's influence extended overseas to cartoonists such as the Dutch Peter Pontiac , who drew inspiration from Binky Brown and Maus to produce Kraut ( 2000 ) , about his father who collaborated with the Nazis during World War II . Chute sees major themes of isolation and coping with OCD recurring in autobiographical works such as Howard Cruse 's Stuck Rubber Baby ( 1995 ) and Alison Bechdel 's Fun Home ( 2006 ) . Hatfield sees echoes of Green 's unrestrained approach to dealing with a mental condition in Madison <unk> 's Cuckoo ( 2002 ) — about <unk> 's dissociative identity disorder — and in David B. ' s Epileptic ( 2003 ) . 
 The story ranked No. 9 on The Comics Journal 's list of the best hundred English @-@ language comics of the 20th century , and featured as the cover artwork for the autobiographical comics issue of the journal Biography ( Vol . 31 , No. 1 ) . Artwork to Binky Brown appeared in an exhibition of Green 's work at Shake It Records in Cincinnati in 2009 .

 Kraków ( Polish pronunciation : [ <unk> ] listen ) , also Cracow or Krakow ( US English / <unk> / , UK English / <unk> / ) , is the second largest and one of the oldest cities in Poland . Situated on the Vistula River ( Polish : Wisła ) in the Lesser Poland region , the city dates back to the 7th century . Kraków has traditionally been one of the leading centres of Polish academic , cultural , and artistic life and is one of Poland 's most important economic hubs . It was the capital of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland from 1038 to 1569 ; the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1569 to 1795 ; the Free City of Kraków from 1815 to 1846 ; the Grand Duchy of Cracow from 1846 to 1918 ; and Kraków Voivodeship from the 14th century to 1998 . It has been the capital of Lesser Poland Voivodeship since 1999 . 
 The city has grown from a Stone Age settlement to Poland 's second most important city . It began as a hamlet on Wawel Hill and was already being reported as a busy trading centre of Slavonic Europe in 965 . With the establishment of new universities and cultural venues at the emergence of the Second Polish Republic in 1918 and throughout the 20th century , Kraków reaffirmed its role as a major national academic and artistic centre . The city has a population of approximately 760 @,@ 000 , with approximately 8 million additional people living within a 100 km ( 62 mi ) radius of its main square . 
 After the invasion of Poland at the start of World War II , Kraków became the capital of Germany 's General Government . The Jewish population of the city was forced into a walled zone known as the Kraków Ghetto , from which they were sent to German extermination camps such as the nearby Auschwitz never to return , and the Nazi concentration camps like Płaszów . 
 In 1978 , Karol Wojtyła , archbishop of Kraków , was elevated to the papacy as Pope John Paul II — the first Slavic pope ever , and the first non @-@ Italian pope in 455 years . Also that year , UNESCO approved the first ever sites for its new World Heritage List , including the entire Old Town in inscribing Cracow 's Historic Centre . Kraków is classified as a global city by GaWC , with the ranking of High sufficiency . Cited as one of Europe 's most beautiful cities , its extensive cultural heritage across the epochs of Gothic , Renaissance and Baroque architecture includes the Wawel Cathedral and the Royal Castle on the banks of the Vistula river , the St. Mary 's Basilica and the largest medieval market square in Europe , the Rynek Główny . Kraków is home to Jagiellonian University , one of the oldest universities in the world and traditionally Poland 's most reputable institution of higher learning . 
 In 2000 , Kraków was named European Capital of Culture . The city will also host the next World Youth Day in 2016 . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name of Kraków is traditionally derived from Krakus ( Krak , <unk> ) , the legendary founder of Kraków and a ruler of the tribe of <unk> . In Polish , Kraków is an archaic possessive form of Krak and essentially means " Krak 's ( town ) " . Krakus 's name may derive from " <unk> " , a Proto @-@ Slavic word meaning a judge 's staff , or a Proto @-@ Slavic word " <unk> " meaning an oak , once a sacred tree most often associated with the concept of genealogy . The first mention of Prince Krakus ( then written as <unk> ) dates back to 1190 , although the town existed as early as the 7th century , inhabited by the tribe of Vistulans . 
 The city 's full official name is <unk> <unk> Miasto Kraków , or " Royal Capital City of Kraków " . In English , a person born or living in Kraków is a <unk> ( Polish : <unk> ) .

 Kraków 's prehistory begins with evidence of a Stone Age settlement on the present site of the Wawel Hill . A legend attributes Kraków 's founding to the mythical ruler Krakus , who built it above a cave occupied by a dragon , <unk> <unk> . The first written record of the city 's name dates back to 965 , when Kraków was described as a notable commercial centre controlled first by Moravia ( 876 – 879 ) , but captured by a Bohemian duke Boleslaus I in 955 . The first acclaimed ruler of Poland , Mieszko I , took Kraków from the Bohemians and incorporated it into the holdings of the Piast dynasty towards the end of his reign . 
 In 1038 , Kraków became the seat of the Polish government . By the end of the 10th century , the city was a leading centre of trade . Brick buildings were constructed , including the Royal Wawel Castle with St. Felix and <unk> Rotunda , Romanesque churches such as St. Adalbert 's , a cathedral , and a basilica . The city was almost entirely destroyed during the Mongol invasion of 1241 . It was rebuilt practically identical , based on new location act and incorporated in 1257 by the high duke Bolesław V the Chaste who following the example of Wrocław , introduced city rights modelled on the Magdeburg law allowing for tax benefits and new trade privileges for the citizens . In 1259 , the city was again ravaged by the Mongols . A third attack in 1287 was repelled thanks in part to the new built fortifications . In 1335 , King Casimir III of Poland ( Kazimierz in Polish ) declared the two western suburbs to be a new city named after him , Kazimierz ( <unk> in Latin ) . The defensive walls were erected around the central section of Kazimierz in 1362 , and a plot was set aside for the Augustinian order next to <unk> . 
 The city rose to prominence in 1364 , when Casimir III of Poland founded the University of Kraków , the second oldest university in central Europe after the Charles University in Prague . King Casimir also began work on a campus for the Academy in Kazimierz , but he died in 1370 and the campus was never completed . The city continued to grow under the joint Lithuanian @-@ Polish Jagiellon dynasty . As the capital of the Kingdom of Poland and a member of the Hanseatic League , the city attracted many craftsmen , businesses , and guilds as science and the arts began to flourish . The royal chancery and the University ensured a first flourishing of Polish literary culture in the city . 
 = = = Poland 's ' Golden Age ' = = = 
 The 15th and 16th centuries were known as Poland 's <unk> Wiek or Golden Age . Many works of Polish Renaissance art and architecture were created , including ancient synagogues in Kraków 's Jewish quarter located in the north @-@ eastern part of Kazimierz , such as the Old Synagogue . During the reign of Casimir IV , various artists came to work and live in Kraków , and Johann Haller established a printing press in the city after Kasper Straube had printed the <unk> <unk> , the first work printed in Poland , in 1473 . 
 In 1520 , the most famous church bell in Poland , named Zygmunt after Sigismund I of Poland , was cast by Hans <unk> . At that time , Hans Dürer , a younger brother of artist and thinker Albrecht Dürer , was Sigismund 's court painter . Hans von <unk> made altarpieces for several churches . In 1553 , the Kazimierz district council gave the Jewish <unk> a licence for the right to build their own interior walls across the western section of the already existing defensive walls . The walls were expanded again in 1608 due to the growth of the community and influx of Jews from Bohemia . In 1572 , King Sigismund II , the last of the <unk> , died childless . The Polish throne passed to Henry III of France and then to other foreign @-@ based rulers in rapid succession , causing a decline in the city 's importance that was worsened by pillaging during the Swedish invasion and by an outbreak of bubonic plague that left 20 @,@ 000 of the city 's residents dead . In 1596 , Sigismund III of the Swedish House of Vasa moved the administrative capital of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth from Kraków to Warsaw . 
 = = = 18th to early 20th centuries = = = 
 Already weakened during the 18th century , by the mid @-@ 1790s the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth had twice been partitioned by its neighbors : Russia , the Habsburg empire , and Prussia . In 1791 , the Austrian Emperor Joseph II changed the status of Kazimierz as a separate city and made it into a district of Kraków . The richer Jewish families began to move out . However , because of the injunction against travel on the Sabbath , most Jewish families stayed relatively close to the historic synagogues . In 1794 , Tadeusz Kościuszko initiated an unsuccessful insurrection in the town 's Main Square which , in spite of his victorious Battle of Racławice against a numerically superior Russian army , resulted in the third and final partition of Poland . In 1809 , Napoleon Bonaparte captured former Polish territories from Austria and made the town part of the Duchy of Warsaw . Following Napoleon 's defeat , the 1815 Congress of Vienna restored the pre @-@ war boundaries but also created the partially independent Free City of Kraków . An insurrection in 1846 failed , resulting in the city being annexed by Austria under the name the Grand Duchy of Cracow ( Polish : Wielkie <unk> Krakowskie , German : <unk> Krakau ) . 
 In 1866 , Austria granted a degree of autonomy to Galicia after its own defeat in the Austro @-@ Prussian War . Politically freer Kraków became a Polish national symbol and a centre of culture and art , known frequently as the " Polish Athens " ( Polskie <unk> ) or " Polish Mecca " . Many leading Polish artists of the period resided in Kraków , among them the seminal painter Jan Matejko , laid to rest at <unk> Cemetery , and the founder of modern Polish drama , Stanisław Wyspiański . Fin de siècle Kraków evolved into a modern metropolis ; running water and electric streetcars were introduced in 1901 , and between 1910 and 1915 , Kraków and its surrounding suburban communities were gradually combined into a single administrative unit called Greater Kraków ( Wielki Kraków ) . 
 At the outbreak of World War I on 3 August 1914 , Józef Piłsudski formed a small cadre military unit , the First Cadre Company — the predecessor of the Polish Legions — which set out from Kraków to fight for the liberation of Poland . The city was briefly besieged by Russian troops in November 1914 . Austrian rule in Kraków ended in 1918 when the Polish Liquidation Committee assumed power .

 With the emergence of the Second Polish Republic , Kraków resumed its role as a major academic and cultural centre with the establishment of new universities such as the AGH University of Science and Technology and the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts , including a number of new and essential vocational schools . It became an important cultural centre for the Polish Jews with a Zionist youth movement relatively strong among the city 's Jewish population . Kraków was also an influential centre of Jewish spiritual life , with all its manifestations of religious observance from Orthodox , to <unk> and Reform flourishing side by side . 
 Following the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939 the city became part of the General Government , a separate administrative region of the Third Reich , and from 4 November 1939 its capital . The General Government was headed by Hans Frank who was based in the city 's Wawel Castle . The Nazis envisioned turning Kraków into a completely German city after removing all Jews and Poles , renamed locations and streets into German and sponsored propaganda attempting to portray it as a historically German city In an operation called " <unk> Krakau " , more than 180 university professors and academics were arrested and sent to Sachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps , though the survivors were later released on the request of prominent Italians . The Jewish population was first confined to a ghetto in which many died of illness or starvation . Those in the Ghetto were later murdered or sent to concentration camps , including Płaszów and Auschwitz . Roman Polanski , the film director , is a survivor of the Ghetto , while Oskar Schindler selected employees from the Ghetto to work in his enamelware plant , Deutsche <unk> Fabrik ( Emalia for short ) saving them from the camps . Although looted by occupational authorities , Kraków remained relatively undamaged at the end of World War II , sparing most of the city 's historical and architectural legacy . Soviet forces entered the city on 18 January 1945 and started arresting Poles loyal to the Polish government @-@ in @-@ exile or those who had served in the Home Army . 
 After the war , under the Polish People 's Republic , the intellectual and academic community of Kraków was put under total political control . The universities were soon deprived of printing rights and autonomy . The Stalinist government ordered the construction of the country 's largest steel mill in the newly created suburb of Nowa Huta . The creation of the giant Lenin Steelworks ( now <unk> Steelworks owned by Mittal ) sealed Kraków 's transformation from a university city to an industrial centre . The new working class , drawn by the industrialisation of Kraków , contributed to rapid population growth . 
 In an effort that spanned two decades , Karol Wojtyła , cardinal archbishop of Kraków , successfully lobbied for permission to build the first churches in the new industrial suburbs . In 1978 , Wojtyła was elevated to the papacy as John Paul II , the first non @-@ Italian pope in 455 years . In the same year , UNESCO placed Kraków Old Town on the first @-@ ever list of World Heritage Sites . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Kraków lies in the southern part of Poland , on the Vistula River ( Polish name : Wisła ) , in a valley at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains , 219 m ( 719 ft ) above sea level ; half way between the Jurassic Rock Upland ( Polish : Jura <unk> @-@ <unk> ) to the north , and the Tatra Mountains 100 km ( 62 mi ) to the south , constituting the natural border with Slovakia and the Czech Republic ; 230 km ( 143 mi ) west from the border with Ukraine . There are five nature reserves in Kraków , with a combined area of ca . 48 @.@ 6 hectares ( 120 acres ) . Due to their ecological value , these areas are legally protected . The western part of the city , along its northern and north @-@ western side , borders an area of international significance known as the Jurassic Bielany @-@ Tyniec refuge . The main motives for the protection of this area include plant and animal wildlife and the area 's geomorphological features and landscape . Another part of the city is located within the ecological ' corridor ' of the Vistula River valley . This corridor is also assessed as being of international significance as part of the Pan @-@ European ecological network . The city centre is situated on the left ( northern ) bank of the river .

 Kraków has an oceanic climate ( Cfb ) according to the Köppen climate classification system , one of the easternmost localities in Europe to do so . A mere 100 km ( 62 mi ) north @-@ east of Kraków ( east of Tarnów , and north of Kielce ) , the January mean dips below − 3 ° C ( 27 ° F ) and thus becomes continental ( Dfb ) in nature . The Kraków climate is also influenced by its far inland position , with significant temperature differences between seasons . Average temperatures in summer range from 18 to 19 @.@ 6 ° C ( 64 to 67 ° F ) and in winter from − 2 @.@ 0 to − 0 @.@ 6 ° C ( 28 to 31 ° F ) . The average annual temperature is 8 @.@ 7 ° C ( 48 ° F ) . In summer temperatures often exceed 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) , and even 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) , while winter drops to − 5 ° C ( 23 ° F ) at night and about 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) at day ; during very cold nights the temperature can drop to − 15 ° C ( 5 ° F ) . Since Kraków lies near the Tatra Mountains , there are often occurrences of <unk> blowing ( a foehn wind ) , causing temperatures to rise rapidly , and even in winter reach up to 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) . 
 The climate table below presents weather data from the years 2000 – 2012 although the official Köppen reference period was from 1981 – 2010 .

 Developed over many centuries , Kraków provides a showcase setting for many historic styles of architecture . As the city expanded , so too did the architectural achievements of its builders . It is for this reason that the variations in style and urban planning are so easily recognisable . 
 Built from its earliest nucleus outward , and having escaped much of the destruction endured by Poland during the 20th @-@ century wars , Kraków 's many architectural monuments can typically be seen in historical order by walking from the city centre out , towards its later districts . Kraków is one of the few medieval towns in Poland that does not have a historic <unk> town hall in its Main Square , because it has not survived the Partitions of Poland . 
 Kraków 's historic centre , which includes the Old Town , Kazimierz and the Wawel Castle , was included as the first of its kind on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1978 . The Stare Miasto is the most prominent example of an old town in the country . For many centuries Kraków was the royal capital of Poland , until Sigismund III Vasa relocated the court to Warsaw in 1596 . The whole district is bisected by the Royal Road , the coronation route traversed by the Kings of Poland . The Route begins at St. Florian 's Church outside the northern flank of the old city @-@ walls in the medieval suburb of <unk> ; passes the Barbican of Kraków ( <unk> ) built in 1499 , and enters Stare Miasto through the Florian Gate . It leads down Floriańska Street through the Main Square , and up <unk> to Wawel , the former seat of Polish royalty , overlooking the Vistula river . Old Town attracts visitors from all over the World . Kraków historic centre is one of the 13 places in Poland that are included in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites . The architectural design of the district had survived all cataclysms of the past and retained its original form coming from the medieval times . The Old Town of Kraków is home to about six thousand historic sites and more than two million works of art . Its rich variety of heritage architecture includes Gothic , Renaissance and Baroque buildings . Kraków 's palaces , churches , theatres and mansions display great variety of color , architectural details , stained glass , paintings , sculptures , and furnishings . 
 In addition to the old town , the city 's district of Kazimierz is particularly notable for its many renaissance buildings and picturesque streets , as well as the historic Jewish quarter located in the north @-@ eastern part of Kazimierz . Kazimierz was founded in the 14th century to the south @-@ east of the city centre and soon became a wealthy , well @-@ populated area where construction of imposing properties became commonplace . Perhaps the most important feature of medieval Kazimierz was the only major , permanent bridge ( Pons Regalis ) across the northern arm of the Vistula . This natural barrier used to separate Kazimierz from the Old Town for several centuries , while the bridge connected Kraków to the Wieliczka Salt Mine and the lucrative Hungarian trade route . The last structure at this location ( at the end of modern <unk> Street ) was dismantled in 1880 when the northern arm of the river was filled in with earth and rock , and subsequently built over . 
 By the 1930s , Kraków had 120 officially registered synagogues and prayer houses that spanned across the old city . Much of Jewish intellectual life had moved to new centres like Podgórze . This in turn , led to the redevelopment and renovation of much of Kazimierz and the development of new districts in Kraków . Most historic buildings in central Kazimierz today are preserved in their original form . Some old buildings however , were not repaired after the devastation brought by the Second World War , and have remained empty . Most recent efforts at restoring the historic neighborhoods gained new impetus around 1993 . Kazimierz is now a well @-@ visited area , seeing a booming growth in Jewish @-@ themed restaurants , bars , bookstores and souvenir shops . 
 As the city of Kraków began to expand further under the rule of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire , the new architectural styles also developed . Key buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries in Kraków include the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts , the directorate of the Polish State Railways as well as the original complex of Kraków Główny railway station and the city 's Academy of Economics . It was also at around that time that Kraków 's first radial boulevards began to appear , with the city undergoing a large @-@ scale program aimed at transforming the ancient Polish capital into a sophisticated regional centre of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire . New representative government buildings and multi @-@ story tenement houses were built at around that time . Much of the urban @-@ planning beyond the walls of the Old Town was done by Polish architects and engineers trained in Vienna . Some major projects of the era include the development of the Jagiellonian University 's new premises and the building of the Collegium Novum just west of the Old Town . The imperial style planning of the city 's further development continued until the return of Poland 's independence , following the First World War . Early modernist style in Kraków is represented by such masterpieces as the Palace of Art by Franciszek <unk> and the ' House under the Globe ' . Secession style architecture , which had arrived in Kraków from Vienna , became popular towards the end of the Partitions . 
 With Poland 's regained independence came the major change in the fortunes of Kraków — now the second most important city of a sovereign nation . The state began to make new plans for the city development and commissioned a number of representative buildings . The predominant style for new projects was modernism with various interpretations of the art @-@ deco style . Important buildings constructed in the style of Polish modernism include the Feniks ' LOT ' building on <unk> Street , the Feniks department store on the Main Square and the Municipal Savings Bank on <unk> Square . The Józef Piłsudski house is also of note as a particularly good example of interwar architecture in the city . 
 After the Second World War , new government turned toward Soviet influence and the Stalinist <unk> . The doctrine of Socialist realism in Poland , as in other countries of the People 's Republics , was enforced from 1949 to 1956 . It involved all domains of art , but its most spectacular achievements were made in the field of urban design . The guidelines for this new trend were spelled @-@ out in a 1949 resolution of the National Council of Party Architects . Architecture was to become a weapon in establishing the new social order by the communists . The ideological impact of urban design was valued more than aesthetics . It aimed at expressing persistence and power . This form of architecture was implemented in the new industrial district of Nowa Huta with apartment blocks constructed according to a Stalinist blueprint , with repetitious courtyards and wide , tree @-@ lined avenues . 
 Since the style of the Renaissance was generally regarded as the most revered in old Polish architecture , it was also used for augmenting Poland 's Socialist national format . However , in the course of incorporating the principles of Socialist realism , there were quite a few deviations introduced by the communists . One of these was to more closely reflect Soviet architecture , which resulted in the majority of works blending into one another . From 1953 , critical opinions in the Party were increasingly frequent , and the doctrine was given up in 1956 marking the end of Stalinism . Currently the soc @-@ realist centre of Nowa Huta is considered to be a meritorious monument of the times . This period in postwar architecture was followed by the mass @-@ construction of large Panel System apartment blocks , most of which were built outside the city centre and thus do not encroach upon the beauty of the old or new towns . Some examples of the new style ( e.g. , Hotel Cracovia ) recently listed as heritage monuments were built during the later half of the 20th century in Kraków . 
 After the Revolutions of 1989 and the birth of the Third Republic in the later half of the 20th century , a number of new architectural projects were completed , including the construction of large business parks and commercial facilities such as the <unk> Krakowska , or infrastructure investments like the Kraków Fast Tram , giving the city a great deal of quality solutions blending with its centuries @-@ old heritage . A good example of this would be the 2007 @-@ built <unk> Wyspiański 2000 , which is used as a multi @-@ purpose information and exhibition space , or the award @-@ winning <unk> Garden of Arts ( <unk> <unk> Sztuki ) , a multi @-@ purpose exhibition and theatre complex located in the historic Old Town . 
 = = = Parks and gardens = = = 
 There are about 40 parks in Kraków including dozens of gardens and forests . Several , like the Planty Park , Botanical Garden , Park Krakowski , Jordan Park and <unk> Park are located in the centre of the city ; with <unk> , <unk> Wolski forest , Strzelecki Park and Park <unk> ( among others ) in the surrounding districts . Parks cover about 318 @.@ 5 hectares ( 2002 ) of the city . 
 The Planty Park is the best @-@ known park in Kraków . It was established between 1822 and 1830 in place of the old city walls , forming a green belt around the Old Town . It consists of a chain of smaller gardens designed in various styles and adorned with monuments . The park has an area of 21 hectares ( 52 acres ) and a length of 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) , forming a scenic walkway popular with Cracovians . 
 The Jordan Park founded in 1889 by Dr Henryk Jordan , was the first public park of its kind in Europe . The park built on the banks of the <unk> river was equipped with running and exercise tracks , playgrounds , the swimming pool , amphitheatre , pavilions , and a pond for boat rowing and water bicycles . It is located on the grounds of a larger Kraków ’ s <unk> Park . The less prominent Park Krakowski was founded in 1885 by Stanisław Rehman but has since been greatly reduced in size because of rapid real estate development . It was a popular destination point with many Cracovians at the end of the 19th century . 
 = = = Environment = = = 
 There are five nature reserves in Kraków with a total area of 48 @.@ 6 ha .

Under its jurisdiction are : the Bielany @-@ Tyniec Landscape Park ( Park <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , <unk> Landscape Park ( Park <unk> ) and Kraków Valleys Landscape Park ( Park <unk> <unk> Krakowskie ) , with their watersheds . All natural reserves of the Polish Jura Chain are part of the <unk> biotopes programme due to their unique flora , fauna , geomorphology and landscape . The western part of Kraków constitute the so @-@ called <unk> Krakowski ecological network , including the ecological corridor of the Vistula river . The southern slopes of limestone hills provide conditions for the development of <unk> vegetation , grasslands and scrubs . 
 The city is spaced along an extended latitudinal transect of the Vistula River Valley with a network of tributaries including its right tributary <unk> , and left : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Sanka . The rivers and their valleys along with bodies of water are some of the most interesting natural wonders of Kraków . 
 = = Governance = = 
 The Kraków City Council has 43 elected members , one of whom is the mayor , or President of Kraków , elected every four years . The election of the City Council and of the local head of government , which takes place at the same time , is based on legislation introduced on 20 June 2002 . The current President of Kraków , re @-@ elected for his fourth term in 2014 , is Jacek <unk> . Several members of the Polish national Parliament ( Sejm ) are elected from the Kraków constituency . The city 's official symbols include a coat of arms , a flag , a seal , and a banner . 
 The responsibilities of Kraków 's president include drafting and implementing resolutions , enacting city bylaws , managing the city budget , employing city administrators , and preparing against floods and natural disasters . The president fulfills his duties with the help of the City Council , city managers and city inspectors . In the 1990s , the city government was reorganised to better differentiate between its political agenda and administrative functions . As a result , the Office of Public Information was created to handle inquiries and foster communication between city departments and citizens at large . 
 In 2000 , the city government introduced a new long @-@ term program called " Safer City " in cooperation with the Police , Traffic , Social Services , Fire , Public Safety , and the Youth Departments . Subsequently , the number of criminal offences went down by 3 percent between 2000 and 2001 , and the rate of detection increased by 1 @.@ 4 percent to a total of 30 @.@ 2 percent in the same period . The city is receiving help in carrying out the program from all educational institutions and the local media , including TV , radio and the press . 
 = = = Districts = = = 
 Kraków is divided into 18 administrative districts ( <unk> ) or boroughs , each with a degree of autonomy within its own municipal government . Prior to March 1991 , the city had been divided into four quarters which still give a sense of identity to Kraków – the towns of Podgórze , Nowa Huta , and <unk> which were absorbed by Kraków as it expanded , and the ancient town centre of Kraków itself . 
 The oldest neighborhoods of Kraków were incorporated into the city before the late 18th century . They include the Old Town ( Stare Miasto ) , once contained within the city defensive walls and now encircled by the Planty park ; the Wawel District , which is the site of the Royal Castle and the cathedral ; <unk> and Kazimierz , the latter originally divided into Christian and Jewish quarters ; as well as the ancient town of <unk> . 
 Major districts added in the 19th and 20th centuries include Podgórze , which until 1915 was a separate town on the southern bank of the Vistula , and Nowa Huta , east of the city centre , built after World War II . 
 Among the most notable historic districts of the city are : Wawel Hill , home to Wawel Castle and Wawel Cathedral , where many Polish kings are buried ; the medieval Old Town , with its Main Market Square ( 200 metres ( 660 ft ) square ) ; dozens of old churches and museums ; the 14th @-@ century buildings of the Jagiellonian University ; and Kazimierz , the historical centre of Kraków 's Jewish social and religious life . 
 The Old Town district of Kraków is home to about six thousand historic sites and more than two million works of art . Its rich variety of historic architecture includes Renaissance , Baroque and Gothic buildings . Kraków 's palaces , churches and mansions display great variety of color , architectural details , stained glass , paintings , sculptures , and furnishings . 
 In the Market Square stands the Gothic St. Mary 's Basilica ( <unk> <unk> ) . It was re @-@ built in the 14th century and features the famous wooden altar ( Altarpiece of Veit Stoss ) , the largest Gothic altarpiece in the World , carved by Veit Stoss . From the church 's main tower a trumpet call ( <unk> <unk> ) , is sounded every hour . The melody , which used to announce the opening and closing of city @-@ gates , ends unexpectedly in midstream . According to legend , the tune was played during the 13th @-@ century Tatar invasion by a guard warning citizens against the attack . He was shot by a Tatar archer while playing , the bugle @-@ call breaking off at the moment he died . The story was recounted in a book published in the late 1920s called The Trumpeter of Krakow , by Eric P. Kelly , which won a Newbery Award . 
 The current divisions were introduced by the Kraków City Hall on 19 April 1995 . Districts were assigned Roman numerals as well as the current name : Stare Miasto ( I ) , <unk> ( II ) , Prądnik <unk> ( III ) , Prądnik Biały ( IV ) , <unk> ( V ) , <unk> ( VI ) , <unk> ( VII ) , <unk> ( VIII ) , <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ( IX ) , <unk> ( X ) , Podgórze <unk> ( XI ) , <unk> @-@ <unk> ( XII ) , Podgórze ( XIII ) , <unk> ( XIV ) , <unk> ( XV ) , <unk> ( XVI ) , <unk> <unk> ( XVII ) , and Nowa Huta ( XVIII ) .

 = = = Religion = = = 
 The metropolitan city of Kraków is known as the city of churches . The abundance of landmark , historic temples along with the plenitude of monasteries and convents earned the city a countrywide reputation as the " Northern Rome " in the past . The churches of Kraków comprise over 120 places of worship ( 2007 ) of which over 65 were built in the 20th century . More are still being added . In addition to Roman Catholicism , other denominations present include Jehovah 's Witnesses , <unk> Church , Polish Catholic Church , Polish Orthodox Church , Protestantism and Latter @-@ Day Saints . 
 Kraków contains also an outstanding collection of monuments of Jewish sacred architecture unmatched anywhere in Poland . Kraków was an influential centre of Jewish spiritual life before the outbreak of World War II , with all its manifestations of religious observance from Orthodox to <unk> and Reform flourishing side by side . There were at least 90 synagogues in Kraków active before the Nazi German invasion of Poland , serving its burgeoning Jewish community of 60 @,@ 000 – 80 @,@ 000 ( out of the city 's total population of 237 @,@ 000 ) , established since the early 12th century . 
 Most synagogues of Kraków were ruined during World War II by the Nazis who despoiled them of all ceremonial objects , and used them as storehouses for ammunition , firefighting equipment , as general storage facilities and stables . The post @-@ Holocaust Jewish population of the city had dwindled to about 5 @,@ 900 before the end of the 1940s . Poland was the only Eastern Bloc country to allow free Jewish aliyah without visas or exit permits upon the conclusion of World War II . By contrast , Stalin forcibly kept Soviet Jews in the USSR , as agreed to in the Yalta Conference . In recent time , thanks to efforts of the local Jewish and Polish organisations including foreign financial aid from the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee , many synagogues underwent major restorations and serve religious and tourist purposes .

 BAE Systems plc is a British multinational defence , security and aerospace company . Its headquarters are in London in the United Kingdom and it has operations worldwide . It is among the world 's largest defence contractors ; it was ranked as the second @-@ largest based on applicable 2012 revenues . Its largest operations are in the United Kingdom and United States , where its BAE Systems Inc. subsidiary is one of the six largest suppliers to the US Department of Defense . Other major markets include Australia , India and Saudi Arabia . The company was formed on 30 November 1999 by the £ 7 @.@ 7 billion merger of two British companies : Marconi Electronic Systems ( MES ) – the defence electronics and naval shipbuilding subsidiary of the General Electric Company plc ( GEC ) – and British Aerospace ( BAe ) – an aircraft , munitions and naval systems manufacturer . 
 BAE Systems is the successor to various aircraft , shipbuilding , armoured vehicle , armaments and defence electronics companies , including the Marconi Company , the first commercial company devoted to the development and use of radio ; A.V. Roe and Company , one of the world 's first aircraft companies ; de Havilland , manufacturer of the Comet , the world 's first commercial jet airliner ; British Aircraft Corporation , co @-@ manufacturer of the Concorde supersonic transport ; Supermarine , manufacturer of the Spitfire ; Yarrow Shipbuilders , builder of the Royal Navy 's first destroyers ; Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company , pioneer of the triple @-@ expansion engine and builder of the world 's first battlecruiser ; and Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering , builder of the Royal Navy 's first submarines . Since its formation it has made a number of acquisitions , most notably of United Defense and Armor Holdings of the United States , and sold its shares in Airbus , Astrium , AMS and Atlas Elektronik . 
 BAE Systems is involved in several major defence projects , including the Lockheed Martin F @-@ 35 Lightning II , the Eurofighter Typhoon , the Astute @-@ class submarine and the Queen Elizabeth @-@ class aircraft carriers . BAE Systems is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index .

 BAE Systems was formed on 30 November 1999 by the £ 7 @.@ 7 billion merger of British Aerospace ( BAe ) and Marconi Electronic Systems ( MES ) . As a result , BAE Systems is the successor to many of the most famous British aircraft , defence electronics and warship manufacturers . Predecessor companies built the Comet , the world 's first commercial jet airliner ; the Harrier " jump jet " , the world 's first operational Vertical / Short Take @-@ Off and Landing ( VTOL ) aircraft ; the " groundbreaking " Blue Vixen radar carried by Sea Harrier FA2s and which formed the basis of the Eurofighter 's CAPTOR radar ; and co @-@ produced the iconic Concorde supersonic airliner with Aérospatiale . 
 British Aerospace was a civil and military aircraft manufacturer , as well as a provider of military land systems . The company had emerged from the massive consolidation of UK aircraft manufacturers since World War II . British Aerospace was formed on 29 April 1977 by the nationalisation and merger of The British Aircraft Corporation ( BAC ) , the Hawker Siddeley Group and Scottish Aviation . Both BAC and Hawker Siddeley were themselves the result of various mergers and acquisitions . 
 Marconi Electronic Systems was the defence subsidiary of British engineering firm The General Electric Company ( GEC ) , dealing largely in military systems integration , as well as naval and land systems . Marconi 's heritage dates back to Guglielmo Marconi 's Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company , founded in 1897 . GEC purchased English Electric ( which included Marconi ) in 1968 and thereafter used the Marconi brand for its defence businesses ( as GEC @-@ Marconi and later Marconi Electronic Systems ) . GEC 's own defence heritage dates back to World War I , when its contribution to the war effort included radios and bulbs . World War II consolidated this position , as the company was involved in important technological advances , notably the cavity magnetron for radar . Between 1945 and 1999 , GEC @-@ Marconi / Marconi Electronic Systems became one of the world 's most important defence contractors . GEC 's major defence related acquisitions included Associated Electrical Industries in 1967 , Yarrow Shipbuilders in 1985 , Plessey companies in 1989 , parts of Ferranti 's defence business in 1990 , the rump of Ferranti when it went into receivership in 1993 / 1994 , Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering in 1995 and Kværner Govan in 1999 . In June 1998 , MES acquired <unk> , a major American defence contractor , for £ 830 million ( approx . US $ 1 @.@ 4 billion c . 1998 ) . 
 = = = Formation = = = 
 The 1997 merger of American corporations Boeing and McDonnell Douglas , which followed the forming of Lockheed Martin , the world 's largest defence contractor in 1995 , increased the pressure on European defence companies to consolidate . In June 1997 British Aerospace Defence managing director John Weston commented " Europe ... is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the U.S. " . European governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity , a European Aerospace and Defence Company . 
 As early as 1995 British Aerospace and the German aerospace and defence company DaimlerChrysler Aerospace ( DASA ) were said to be keen to create a transnational aerospace and defence company . The two companies envisaged including Aérospatiale , the other major European aerospace company , but only after its privatisation . The first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of Airbus from a consortium of British Aerospace , DASA , Aérospatiale and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA into an integrated company ; in this aim British Aerospace and DASA were united against the various objections of Aérospatiale . As well as Airbus , British Aerospace and DASA were partners in the Panavia Tornado and Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft projects . Merger discussions began between British Aerospace and DASA in July 1998 , just as French participation became more likely with the announcement that Aérospatiale was to merge with Matra and emerge with a diluted French government shareholding . A merger was agreed between British Aerospace chairman Richard Evans and DASA CEO Jürgen Schrempp in December 1998 . 
 Meanwhile , GEC was also under pressure to participate in defence industry consolidation . Reporting the appointment of George Simpson as GEC managing director in 1996 , The Independent had said " some analysts believe that Mr Simpson 's inside knowledge of BAe , a long @-@ rumoured GEC bid target , was a key to his appointment . GEC favours forging a national ' champion ' defence group with BAe to compete with the giant US organisations . " When GEC put MES up for sale on 22 December 1998 , British Aerospace abandoned the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival . The merger of British Aerospace and MES was announced on 19 January 1999 . Evans stated that in 2004 that his fear was that an American defence contractor would acquire MES and challenge both British Aerospace and DASA . The merger created a vertically integrated company which The Scotsman described as " [ a combination of British Aerospace 's ] contracting and platform @-@ building skills with Marconi 's coveted electronics systems capability " , for example combining the manufacturer of the Eurofighter with the company that provided many of the aircraft 's electronic systems ; British Aerospace was MES ' largest customer . In contrast , DASA 's response to the breakdown of the merger discussion was to merge with Aérospatiale to create the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company ( EADS ) , a horizontal integration . EADS has since considered a merger with Thales to create a " fully rounded " company . 
 Seventeen undertakings were given by BAE Systems to the Department of Trade and Industry which prevented a reference of the merger to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission . These were largely to ensure that the integrated company would tender sub @-@ contracts to external companies on an equal basis with its subsidiaries . Another condition was the " <unk> " of former British Aerospace and MES teams on defence projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter ( JSF ) . In 2007 the government , on advice from the Office of Fair Trading , announced it had agreed to release BAE Systems from ten of the undertakings due to " a change in circumstances " . 
 BAE Systems inherited the UK government owned " golden " share that was established when British Aerospace was privatised . This unique share prevents amendments of certain parts of the company 's Articles of Association without the permission of the Secretary of State . These Articles require that no foreign person or persons acting together may hold more than 15 % of the company 's shares or control the majority of the board and that the CEO and the Chairman of BAE Systems must be British nationals . 
 British Aerospace 's head office was in Warwick House , Farnborough Aerospace Centre in Farnborough , Hampshire . BAE Systems retains this but the registered office , and base for the senior leadership team , is in the City of Westminster .

 BAE Systems ' first annual report identified Airbus , support services to militaries and integrated systems for air , land and naval applications as key areas of growth . It also stated the company 's desire to both expand in the US and participate in further consolidation in Europe . BAE Systems described 2001 as an " important year " for its European joint ventures , which were reorganised considerably . The company has described the rationale for expansion in the US ; " [ it ] is by far the largest defence market with spend running close to twice that of the Western European nations combined . Importantly , US investment in research and development is significantly higher than in Western Europe . " When Dick Olver was appointed chairman in July 2004 he ordered a review of the company 's businesses which ruled out further European acquisitions or joint ventures and confirmed a " strategic bias " for expansion and investment in the US . The review also confirmed the attractiveness of the land systems sector and , with two acquisitions in 2004 and 2005 , BAE moved from a limited land systems supplier to the second largest such company in the world . This shift in strategy was described as " remarkable " by the Financial Times . Between 2008 and early 2011 BAE acquired five cyber security companies in a shift in strategy to take account of reduced spending by governments on " traditional defence items such as warships and tanks " . 
 In 2000 Matra Marconi Space , a joint BAE Systems / Matra company , was merged with the space division of DASA to form Astrium . On 16 June 2003 BAE sold its 25 % share to EADS for £ 84 million , however due to the <unk> status of the company , BAE Systems invested an equal amount for " restructuring " . In January 2001 Airbus Industrie was transformed from an inherently inefficient consortium structure to a formal joint stock company . BAE Systems sold its 54 % majority share of BAE Systems Canada , an electronics company , in April for CA $ 310 ( approx . £ 197 million as of December 2010 ) . In November 2001 , the company announced the closure of the Avro Regional Jet ( Avro RJ ) production line at Woodford and the cancellation of the Avro RJX , an advanced series of the aircraft family , as the business was " no longer viable " . The final Avro RJ to be completed became the last British civil airliner . In November 2001 BAE sold its 49 @.@ 9 % share of Thomson Marconi Sonar to Thales for £ 85 million . A further step of European defence consolidation was the merger of BAE 's share of Matra BAe Dynamics and the missile division of Alenia Marconi Systems ( AMS ) into MBDA in December . MBDA thus became the world 's second largest missile manufacturer . Although EADS has been reported to be interested in acquiring full control of MBDA , BAE has said that , unlike Airbus , MBDA is a " core business " . 
 In June 2002 , BAE Systems confirmed it was in takeover discussions with TRW , an American aerospace , automotive and defence business . This was prompted by Northrop Grumman 's £ 4 @.@ 1 billion ( approx . US $ 6 billion c . 2002 ) hostile bid for TRW in February 2002 . A bidding war between BAE Systems , Northrop and General Dynamics ended on 1 June when Northrop 's increased bid of £ 5 @.@ 1 billion was accepted . On 11 December 2002 , the company issued a shock profit warning due to cost overruns of the Nimrod MRA4 maritime reconnaissance / attack aircraft and the Astute @-@ class submarine projects . On 19 February 2003 BAE took a charge of £ 750 million against these projects and the Ministry of Defence ( MOD ) agreed to pay a further £ 700 million of the cost . In 2000 the company had taken a £ 300 million " loss charge " on the Nimrod contract which was expected to cover " all the costs of completion of the current contract " . 
 The UK government , following a cabinet row described as " one of the most bitter Cabinet disputes over defence contracts since the Westland helicopter affair in 1985 " , ordered 20 BAE Hawk trainer aircraft with 24 options in July 2003 in a deal worth £ 800 million . The deal was significant because it was a factor in India 's decision to finalise a £ 1 billion order for 66 Hawks in March 2004 . Also in July 2003 BAE Systems and Finmeccanica announced their intention to set up three joint venture companies , to be collectively known as <unk> . These companies would have pooled the avionics , <unk> and communications businesses of the two companies . However the difficulties of integrating the companies in this way led to a re @-@ evaluation of the proposal ; BAE Systems ' 2004 Annual Report states that " recognising the complexity of the earlier proposed <unk> transaction with Finmeccanica we have moved to a simpler model " . The main part of this deal was the dissolution of AMS and the establishment of SELEX Sensors and Airborne Systems ; BAE Systems sold its 25 % share of the latter to Finmeccanica for € 400 million ( approx . £ 270 million c . 2007 ) in March 2007 . 
 In May 2004 , it was reported that the company was considering selling its shipbuilding divisions , BAE Systems Naval Ships and BAE Systems Submarines . It was understood that General Dynamics wished to acquire the submarine building facilities at Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness , while VT Group was said to be interested in the remaining yards on the Clyde . However , in 2008 BAE Systems merged its Surface Fleet arm with the shipbuilding operations of VT Group to form BVT Surface Fleet , an aim central to the British Government 's Defence Industrial Strategy . 
 On 4 June 2004 , BAE Systems outbid General Dynamics for Alvis Vickers , the UK 's main manufacturer of armoured vehicles . Alvis Vickers was merged with the company 's RO Defence unit to form BAE Systems Land Systems . Recognising the lack of scale of this business compared to General Dynamics , BAE Systems executives soon identified the US defence company United Defense Industries ( UDI ) , a major competitor to General Dynamics , as a main acquisition target . On 7 March 2005 BAE announced the £ 2 @.@ 25 billion ( approx . US $ 4 @.@ 2 billion c . 2005 ) acquisition of UDI . UDI , now BAE Systems Land and Armaments , manufactures combat vehicles , artillery systems , naval guns , missile launchers and precision guided munitions . 
 In December 2005 , BAE Systems announced the sale of its German naval systems subsidiary , Atlas Elektronik , to ThyssenKrupp and EADS . The sale was complicated by the requirement of the German government to approve any sale . The Financial Times described the sale as " cut price " because French company Thales bid € 300 million , but was blocked from purchasing Atlas on national security grounds . On 31 January 2006 the company announced the sale of BAE Systems <unk> to Spirit <unk> , Inc , having said as early as 2002 that it wished to dispose of what it did not regard as a " core business " . 
 On 18 August 2006 Saudi Arabia signed a contract worth £ 6 billion to £ 10 billion for 72 Eurofighter Typhoons , to be delivered by BAE Systems . On 10 September 2006 the company was awarded a £ 2 @.@ 5 billion contract for the upgrade of 80 Royal Saudi Air Force Tornado IDSs . One of BAE Systems ' major aims , as highlighted in the 2005 Annual Report , was the granting of increased technology transfer between the UK and the US . The F @-@ 35 ( JSF ) programme became the focus of this effort , with British government ministers such as Lord Drayson , Minister for Defence Procurement , suggesting the UK would withdraw from the project without the transfer of technology that would allow the UK to operate and maintain F @-@ 35s independently . However , on 12 December 2006 , Lord Drayson signed an agreement which allows " an unbroken British chain of command " for operation of the aircraft . On 22 December 2006 BAE received a £ 947 million contract to provide guaranteed availability of Royal Air Force ( RAF ) Tornados . 
 On 7 May 2007 the company announced its subsidiary BAE Systems Inc. was to purchase Armor Holdings for £ 2 @.@ 3 billion ( approx . US $ 4 @.@ 5 billion c . 2007 ) and completed the deal on 31 July 2007 . The company is a manufacturer of tactical wheeled vehicles and a provider of vehicle and individual armour systems and survivability technologies . BAE Systems ( and British Aerospace previously ) was a technology partner to the McLaren Formula One team from 1996 to December 2007 . The partnership originally focused on McLaren 's F1 car 's aerodynamics , eventually moving on to carbon fibre techniques , wireless systems and fuel management . BAE Systems ' main interest in the partnership was to learn about the high speed build and operations processes of McLaren . 
 The company announced the acquisition of Tenix Defence , a major Australian defence contractor on 18 January 2008 . The purchase was completed on 27 June for A $ 775 million ( £ 373 million ) making BAE Systems Australia that country 's largest defence contractor . The UK Ministry of Defence awarded BAE Systems a 15 @-@ year munitions contract in August 2008 worth up to £ 3 billion . The contract guarantees supply of 80 % of the UK Armed Forces ' ammunition and required BAE to modernise its munitions manufacturing facilities . BAE Systems expanded its intelligence and security business with the £ 531 million purchase of <unk> Group in July 2008 . It continued this strategy with purchases of Danish cyber and intelligence company <unk> for approximately $ 210 million in December 2010 , and <unk> Group PLC the following month for € 217 million . The latter provides counter fraud and anti @-@ money laundering solutions to the global financial services industry where its software assists institutions to comply with regulations on financial intelligence and monitoring . 
 = = = = Airbus shareholding = = = = 
 BAE Systems inherited British Aerospace 's share of Airbus Industrie , which consisted of two factories at Broughton and Filton . These facilities manufactured wings for the Airbus family of aircraft . In 2001 Airbus was incorporated as Airbus SAS , a joint stock company . In return for a 20 % share in the new company BAE Systems transferred ownership of its Airbus plants ( known as Airbus UK ) to the new company . 
 Despite repeated suggestions as early as 2000 that BAE Systems wished to sell its 20 % share of Airbus , the possibility was consistently denied by the company . However , on 6 April 2006 BBC News reported that it was indeed to sell its stake , then " conservatively valued " at £ 2 @.@ 4 billion . Due to the slow pace of informal negotiations , BAE Systems exercised its put option which saw investment bank Rothschild appointed to give an independent valuation . Six days after this process began , Airbus announced delays to the A380 with significant effects on the value of Airbus shares . On 2 June 2006 Rothschild valued the company 's share at £ 1 @.@ 87 billion , well below its own analysts ' and even EADS ' expectations . The BAE Systems board recommended that the company proceed with the sale . On 4 October 2006 shareholders voted in favour and the sale was completed on 13 October . BAE Systems ' sale of its Airbus share saw the end of UK owned involvement in civil airliner production . Airbus Operations Ltd ( the former Airbus UK ) continues to be the Airbus " Centre of Excellence " for wing production , employing over 9 @,@ 500 , but is entirely owned by the Airbus Group ( formerly EADS ) .

 In February 2010 BAE Systems announced a £ 592 million writedown of the former Armor Holdings business following the loss of the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles contract in 2009 . It was outbid by Oshkosh Corporation for the £ 2 @.@ 3 billion ( $ 3 @.@ 7 billion ) contract . Land and Armaments had been the " star performer " of BAE Systems ' subsidiaries , growing from sales of £ 482 million in 2004 to £ 6 @.@ 7 billion in 2009 . 
 BAE Systems inherited British Aerospace 's 35 % share of Saab AB , with which it produced and marketed the Gripen fighter aircraft . In 2005 it reduced this share to 20 @.@ 5 % and in March 2010 announced its intention to sell the remainder . The Times stated that the decision brought " to an end its controversial relationship with the Gripen fighter aircraft " . Several of the export campaigns for the aircraft were subject to allegations of bribery and corruption . Meanwhile , the company was increasing its presence in India with the formation of Defence Land Systems India in April , a joint venture with Mahindra & Mahindra Limited . BAE Systems holds just 26 % of the equity due to Indian foreign direct investment regulations . 
 The company continued its move into support services in May 2010 with the purchase of the marine support company Atlantic Marine for $ 352 million . In September 2010 BAE Systems announced plans to sell the Platform Solutions division of BAE Systems Inc . , which the Financial Times said could yield as much as £ 1 @.@ 3 billion . However , despite " considerable expressions of interest " , the sale was abandoned in January 2011 . On 19 October 2010 the British government cancelled the Nimrod project as part of its Strategic Defence and Security Review . The purchases of Queen Elizabeth @-@ class aircraft carrier , the Astute class submarines , and the Type 26 frigates were all confirmed . A new generation of nuclear missile submarines will be built , however the final decision will be delayed until after the next election . 
 BAE Systems sold the regional aircraft lease portfolio and asset management arm of its BAE Systems Regional Aircraft business in May 2011 . This unit leases the BAe 146 / Avro RJ family , BAe ATP , Jetstream and BAe 748 . The company retained the support and engineering activities of the business as part of the transaction . 
 In September 2011 , BAE Systems began consultation with unions and workers over plans to cut nearly 3 @,@ 000 jobs , mostly in the company 's military aircraft division . 
 In its 2012 half @-@ year report , the company revealed a 10 % decline in revenue in the six months up to 30 June due to falling demand for armaments . In May 2012 the governments of the UK and Saudi Arabia reached an agreement on an arms package which saw a £ 1 @.@ 6 billion contract awarded to BAE for the delivery of 55 Pilatus PC @-@ 21 and 22 BAE Systems Hawk aircraft . The Sultanate of Oman ordered Typhoon and Hawk aircraft worth £ 2 @.@ 5 billion in December 2012 . 
 On 13 September 2012 , it was reported that BAE Systems and EADS had entered possible merger talks . In case of a potential tie @-@ up , BAE shareholders would own 40 % and EADS ' 60 % of the new organisation . However , on 10 October 2012 , the companies said the merger talks had been called off . 
 In July 2014 it announced the acquisition of US intelligence capability , Signal Innovations Group Inc . , to augment imagery and data analysis technologies in its Intelligence & Security business . 
 In August 2014 , BAE was awarded a £ 248 million contract from the British government to build three new offshore patrol vessels . 
 In October 2014 , BAE Systems and Babcock International won contracts from the British Ministry of Defence worth a total of £ 3 @.@ 2 billion to maintain British warships , submarines and naval bases for the following five years . 
 On 9 October 2014 , the company announced the loss of 440 management jobs across the country , with 286 of the job cuts in Lancashire .

 BAE Systems plays a significant role in the production of military equipment . In 2008 , 95 % of BAE Systems ' total sales were military related . 
 It plays important roles in military aircraft production . The company 's Typhoon fighter and Tornado fighter @-@ bomber are both front line aircraft of the RAF . The company is a major partner in the F @-@ 35 Lightning II programme . Its Hawk advanced jet trainer aircraft has been widely exported . In July 2006 , the British government declassified the <unk> ( High Endurance Rapid Technology Insertion ) , an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ( UAV ) which can navigate autonomously .

 BAE Systems is the predominant supplier to the UK Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) ; in 2009 / 2010 BAE Systems companies in the list of Top 100 suppliers to the MoD received contracts totalling £ 3 @.@ 98 billion , with total revenue being higher when other subsidiary income is included . In comparison , the second largest supplier is Babcock International Group and its subsidiaries , with a revenue of £ 1 @.@ 1 billion from the MoD . Oxford Economic Forecasting states that in 2002 the company 's UK businesses employed 111 @,@ 578 people , achieved export sales of £ 3 billion and paid £ 2 @.@ 6 billion in taxes . These figures exclude the contribution of Airbus UK . 
 After its creation BAE Systems had a difficult relationship with the MoD . This was attributed to deficient project management by the company , but also in part to the deficiencies in the terms of " fixed price contracts " . CEO Mike Turner said in 2006 " We had entered into contracts under the old competition rules that frankly we shouldn 't have taken " . These competition rules were introduced by Lord Levene during the 1980s to shift the burden of risk to the contractor and were in contrast to " cost plus contracts " where a contractor was paid for the value of its product plus an agreed profit . 
 BAE Systems was operating in " the only truly open defence market " , which meant that it was competing with US and European companies for British defence projects , while they were protected in their home markets . The US defence market is competitive , however largely between American firms , while foreign companies are excluded . In December 2005 the MoD published the Defence Industrial Strategy ( DIS ) which has been widely acknowledged to recognise BAE Systems as the UK 's " national champion " . The DIS identifies key industrial capabilities which must be maintained within the UK through long @-@ term government commitments to support research spending and procurement . Of these capabilities , several are dominated by BAE Systems , including naval vessels and submarines , combat vehicles , fixed @-@ wing aircraft , general munitions ( with the exception of certain " niche capabilities abroad " ) and network @-@ enabled capability ( defined as <unk> in the DIS ) . The company maintains an interest in future UAV technologies through its collaborative <unk> research programme with <unk> . 
 After the publication of the DIS BAE Systems CEO Mike Turner said " If we didn 't have the DIS and our profitability and the terms of trade had stayed as they were ... then there had to be a question mark about our future in the UK " . Lord Levene said in the balance between value for money or maintaining a viable industrial base the DIS " tries as well as it can to steer a middle course and to achieve as much as it can in both directions . ... We will never have a perfect solution . " 
 In May 2012 , the MOD awarded BAE Systems a £ <unk> contract to design the UK 's next generation nuclear @-@ armed submarines . 
 On 6 November 2013 , BAE Systems announced that 1 @,@ 775 jobs are to go at its yards in England and Scotland .

 The attraction of MES to British Aerospace was largely its ownership of <unk> , a major American defence contractor . Since its creation the company has steadily increased its investment in and revenues from the US . 
 BAE Systems Inc. now sells more to the US Department of Defense ( DOD ) than the UK MoD . The company has been allowed to buy important defence contractors in the US , however its status as a UK company requires that its US subsidiaries are governed by American executives under Special Security Arrangements . The company faces fewer impediments in this sense than its European counterparts , as there is a high degree of integration between the US and UK defence establishments . BAE Systems ' purchase of Lockheed Martin Aerospace Electronic Systems in November 2000 was described by John Hamre , CEO of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former Deputy Secretary of Defense , as " precedent setting " given the advanced and classified nature of many of that company 's products . 
 The possibility of a merger between BAE Systems Inc. and major North American defence contractors has long been reported , including Boeing , General Dynamics , Lockheed Martin , and Raytheon .

 BAE Systems ' chairman is Sir Roger Carr . The executive directors are Ian King ( CEO ) , Jerry <unk> , and George Rose . The non @-@ executive directors are Harriet Green , Michael <unk> , Sir Peter Mason , Carl Symon , Roberto <unk> , Paul Anderson and Nick Rose . 
 The company 's first CEO , John Weston , was forced to resign in 2002 in a boardroom " coup " and was replaced by Mike Turner . The Business reported that Weston was ousted when non @-@ executive directors informed the chairman that they had lost confidence in him . Further , it was suggested that at least one non @-@ executive director was encouraged to make such a move by the MOD due to the increasingly fractious relationship between BAE Systems and the government . As well as the terms of the Nimrod contract , Weston had fought against the MOD 's insistence that one of the first three Type 45 destroyers should be built by VT Group . The Business said he considered this " competition @-@ policy gone mad " . 
 It is understood that Turner had a poor working relationship with senior MOD officials , ( for example with former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon ) Significantly the first meeting between Olver and Hoon was said to have gone well , a MOD official commented " He is a man we can do business with . We think it is good to be taking a fresh look at things . " It has been suggested that relations between Turner and Olver were tense . On 16 October 2007 the company announced that Mike Turner would retire in August 2008 . The Times called his departure plans " abrupt " and a " shock " , given previous statements that he wished to retire in 2013 at the age of 65 . Despite suggestions that BAE Systems would prefer an American CEO due to the increasing importance of the United States defence market to the company and the opportunity to make a clean break from corruption allegations and investigations related to the Al Yamamah contracts the company announced on 27 June 2008 that it had selected the company 's chief operating officer , Ian King , to succeed Turner with effect from 1 September 2008 ; The Financial Times noted that King 's career at Marconi distances him from the British Aerospace @-@ led Al Yamamah project . 
 In 2015 the company invested more than £ 11m in charities and not @-@ for @-@ profit organisations through company and employee donations to support its key areas of customer , education and heritage .

 BAE Systems has been under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office , into the use of political corruption to help sell arms to Chile , Czech Republic , Romania , Saudi Arabia , South Africa , Tanzania and Qatar . In response , BAE Systems ' 2006 Corporate Responsibility Report states " We continue to reject these allegations ... We take our obligations under the law extremely seriously and will continue to comply with all legal requirements around the world . In June 2007 Lord Woolf was selected to lead what the BBC described as an " independent review .... [ an ] ethics committee to look into how the defence giant conducts its arms deals . " The report , Ethical business conduct in BAE Systems plc – the way forward , made 23 recommendations , measures which the company has committed to implement . The finding stated that " in the past BAE did not pay sufficient attention to ethical standards in the way it conducted business , " and was described by the BBC as " an embarrassing admission . " 
 In September 2009 , the Serious Fraud Office announced that it intended to prosecute BAE Systems for offences relating to overseas corruption . The Guardian claimed that a penalty " possibly of more than £ 500m " might be an acceptable settlement package . On 5 February 2010 , BAE Systems agreed to pay £ <unk> criminal fines to the US and £ 30m to the UK . The UK had already massively benefited from £ 43 billion contract in tax receipts and jobs in the UK , and dropped an anti @-@ corruption investigation into the Al Yamamah contracts later taken up by US authorities . Crucially , under a plea bargain with the US Department of Justice , BAE Systems was convicted of felony conspiracy to defraud the United States government and sentenced in March 2010 by US District Court Judge John D. Bates to pay a $ 400 million fine , one of the largest fines in the history of the DOJ . Judge Bates said the company 's conduct involved " deception , duplicity and knowing violations of law , I think it 's fair to say , on an enormous scale " . BAE Systems did not directly admit to bribery , and is thus not internationally blacklisted from future contracts . Some of the £ 30m penalty the company will pay in fines to the UK will be paid ex gratia for the benefit of the people of Tanzania . On 2 March 2010 Campaign Against Arms Trade and The Corner House were successful in gaining a High Court injunction on the Serious Fraud Office 's settlement with BAE Systems . The High Court may order a full review of the settlement . 
 = = = Saudi Arabia = = = 
 BAE Systems ( and British Aerospace previously ) has long been the subject of allegations of bribery in relation to its business in Saudi Arabia . The UK National Audit Office ( NAO ) investigated the Al Yamamah contracts and has so far not published its conclusions , the only NAO report ever to be withheld . The MOD has stated " The report remains sensitive . Disclosure would harm both international relations and the UK 's commercial interests . " The company has been accused of maintaining a £ 60 million Saudi slush fund and was the subject of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office ( SFO ) . However , on 14 December 2006 it was announced that the SFO was " discontinuing " its investigation into the company . It stated that representations to its Director and the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith had led to the conclusion that the wider public interest " to safeguard national and international security " outweighed any potential benefits of further investigation . The termination of the investigation has been controversial . In June 2007 , the BBC 's Panorama alleged BAE Systems " paid hundreds of millions of pounds to the ex @-@ Saudi ambassador to the US , Prince Bandar bin Sultan " in return for his role in the Al Yamamah deals . In late June 2007 the United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) began a formal investigation into BAE 's compliance with anti @-@ corruption laws . On 19 May 2008 BAE Systems confirmed that its CEO Mike Turner and non @-@ executive director Nigel Rudd had been detained " for about 20 minutes " at two US airports the previous week and that the DOJ had issued " a number of additional subpoenas in the US to employees of BAE Systems plc and BAE Systems Inc as part of its ongoing investigation " . The Times suggested that such " humiliating behaviour by the DOJ " is unusual toward a company that is co @-@ operating fully . 
 A judicial review of the decision by the SFO to drop the investigation was granted on 9 November 2007 . On 10 April 2008 the High Court ruled that the SFO " acted unlawfully " by dropping its investigation . The Times described the ruling as " one of the most strongly worded judicial attacks on government action " which condemned how " ministers ' buckled ' to ' blatant threats ' that Saudi cooperation in the fight against terror would end unless the ... investigation was dropped . " On 24 April the SFO was granted leave to appeal to the House of Lords against the ruling . There was a two @-@ day hearing before the Lords on 7 and 8 July 2008 . On 30 July the House of Lords unanimously overturned the High Court ruling , stating that the decision to discontinue the investigation was lawful .

 In September 2005 The Guardian reported that banking records showed that BAE Systems paid £ 1 million to Augusto Pinochet , the former Chilean dictator . The Guardian has also reported that " clandestine arms deals " have been under investigation in Chile and the UK since 2003 and that British Aerospace and BAE Systems made a number of payments to Pinochet advisers . In 2003 , HMS Sheffield was sold to the Chilean Navy for £ 27 million , however the government 's profit from the sale was £ 3 million , after contracts worth £ 24 million were placed with BAE Systems for upgrade and refurbishment of the ship . 
 BAE Systems is alleged to have paid " secret offshore commissions " of over £ 7 million to secure the sale of HMS London and HMS Coventry to the Romanian Navy . The company received a £ 116 million contract for the refurbishment of the ships prior to delivery ; however the British taxpayer only received the scrap value of £ 100 @,@ 000 each from the sale . 
 BAE Systems ran into controversy in 2002 over the abnormally high cost of a radar system sold to Tanzania . The sale was criticised by several opposition MPs and the World Bank ; Secretary of State for International Development Clare Short declared that BAE Systems had " ripped off " developing nations . In December 2010 , leaked US diplomatic communications revealed that Edward <unk> , the Tanzanian prosecutor investigating misconduct by BAE Systems , had confided in US diplomats that " his life may be in danger " and was being routinely threatened . 
 In January 2007 , details of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into BAE Systems ' sales tactics in regard to South Africa were reported , highlighting the £ 2 @.@ 3 billion deal to supply Hawk trainers and Gripen fighters as suspect . In May 2011 , as allegations of bribery behind South Africa 's Gripen procurement continued , the company 's partner Saab AB issued strong denials of any illicit payments being made ; however in June 2011 Saab announced that BAE Systems had made unaccounted payments of roughly $ 3 @.@ 5 million to a consultant , this revelation prompted South African Opposition parties to call for a renewed inquiry .

 Imra ’ ul @-@ Qais bin Hujr al @-@ Kindi ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> / ALA @-@ LC : <unk> ’ al @-@ Qays ibn <unk> al @-@ <unk> ) was an Arabic poet in the 6th century AD , and also the son of one of the last Kindite kings . He is sometimes considered the father of Arabic poetry . His <unk> , or long poem , " Let us stop and weep " ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> ) is one of the seven Mu <unk> , poems prized as the best examples of pre @-@ Islamic Arabian verse . Imru ' al @-@ Qais was born in the Najd region of northern Arabia sometime in the early 6th century AD . His father was said to be Hujr bin al @-@ Harith ( حجر ابن الحارث / <unk> ibn al @-@ <unk> ) , the Kindah monarchy 's regent over the tribes of Asad and <unk> , and it is believed that Imru ' al @-@ Qais was born in the territory of Asad . His mother was said to be Fatimah bint Rabi 'ah al @-@ Taghlibi ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> / <unk> bint <unk> ‘ ah al @-@ <unk> ) . 
 Legend has it that Imru ' al @-@ Qais was the youngest of his father 's sons , and began composing poetry while he was still a child . His father strongly disapproved of this habit in his son , believing poetry to be an unseemly pastime for the son of a king . His father also disapproved of Imru ' al @-@ Qais ' scandalous lifestyle of drinking and chasing women , and eventually banished him from his kingdom , or so the legend goes . Later , when the tribe of Asad rebelled and assassinated his father , Imru ' al @-@ Qais was the only one of his brothers to take responsibility for avenging his death . <unk> wine and women , he fought the tribe of Asad until he had exacted revenge in blood , and spent the remainder of his life trying to regain his father 's kingdom . 
 Like many figures of early Arabia , which at that time lacked a formal writing system and relied on the oral transmission of stories , the details of the life of Imru ' al @-@ Qais are hard to determine with any certainty . Even so , historians have been able to compare the various stories written down by later biographers with clues from Imru ' al @-@ Qais ' own poems and information about major historical events in the Persian and Byzantine empires to reconstruct a probable account of the life and ancestry of this most famous of the <unk> ( pre @-@ Islamic ) poets . 
 According to one account , his full name and ancestry was Imru ' al @-@ Qais , son of Hujr , son of al @-@ Harith , son of ' Amr , son of Hujr the eater of bitter herbs , son of Mu <unk> , son of Thawr of the tribe of Kindah ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> ابن حجر ابن الحارث ابن <unk> ابن حجر <unk> <unk> ابن <unk> ابن <unk> <unk> ) . He was also referred to as " The Lost King " ( الملك <unk> / al @-@ Malik <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , because he was never able to recover his father 's throne . 
 = = Ancestry = = 
 The tribe of Kindah had its origins in Southern Arabia of and migrated north to Najd sometime in the 4th or 5th century AD . Sometime in the 5th century they asked the king of Yemen to select them a king , and Hujr the " eater of bitter herbs " became the first Kindite king . He was succeeded by his son ' Amr , who was succeeded by his son al @-@ Harith , who was the greatest of all the Kindite kings . One of al @-@ Harith 's sons was Hujr , and he made him regent over the tribes of Asad and <unk> , and Hujr was the father of Imru ' al @-@ Qais . 
 Of al @-@ Harith , it is told that when the Persian emperor Kavadh I adopted the teachings of the religious revolutionary Mazdak , al @-@ Harith converted to Mazdakism with him . This caused Kavadh to make al @-@ Harith king of the Hirah , a region in the south of modern @-@ day Iraq , and expel his previous Arab vassal al @-@ Mundhir . Kavadh 's son Khosrau I rejected Mazdakism and rebuked al @-@ Harith , restoring al @-@ Mundhir to the throne of the Hirah . It is not known for sure how al @-@ Harith died , but some reports indicate he was captured by al @-@ Mundhir as he fled al @-@ Hirah , and then killed along with two of his sons and more than forty of his kinsmen . Imru ' al @-@ Qais mourns this tragedy in one of the poems attributed to him : 
 Weep for me , my eyes ! Spill your tears 
 And mourn for me the vanished kings 
 Hujr ibn ' <unk> 's princely sons 
 Led away to slaughter at eventide ; 
 If only they had died in combat 
 Not in the lands of Banu Marina ! 
 No water was there to wash their fallen heads , 
 And their skulls lie spattered with blood 
 <unk> over by birds 
 Who tear out first the eyebrows , then the eyes . 
 ( Diwan , Poem 2 ) 
 In 525 AD Yemen was occupied by the Negus ( Emperor ) of Axum ( modern @-@ day Ethiopia ) . With their sponsor destroyed , the Kindah monarchy quickly fell apart . It is probably during this period that the tribe of Asad rebelled and killed Imru ' al @-@ Qais ' father , Hujr . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Historians are divided as to the year of Imru ' al @-@ Qais ' birth , but one estimate is that he was born sometime around 526 AD . He was said to be the youngest of the sons of Hujr , king over the tribes of Asad and <unk> . Some historians have pointed out that his father had other wives and concubines than his mother , in accordance with the custom of kings at this time , and it is possible that he received little fatherly attention . He began composing poetry from an early age , an activity that his father strongly disapproved of because it was not considered appropriate for the son of a king . Al @-@ Tahir Ahmad Makki comments that " among the northern tribes , likewise , each tribe had its chief and its poet , and the two were hardly ever the same . " 
 Another source of friction with his father was Imru ' al @-@ Qais ' excessive dedication to lewd drinking parties and his scandalous pursuit of women . One story says that , concerned with his son 's lack of responsibility , Hujr tried putting Imru ' al @-@ Qais in charge of the family 's camel herds , an experiment which ended in disaster . Another story says that Hujr finally disowned his son after Imru ' al @-@ Qais publicly courted his cousin ' <unk> , and after failing to win her hand in marriage , managed to enjoy her affections in secret , which caused a considerable scandal in the family . Yet other stories say that Imru ' al @-@ Qais may have written some lewd verses about his father 's wives or concubines , and that this was the cause of their falling out . Whatever the reason , most of the stories agree that Hujr became exasperated with his son 's behavior and expelled him from his kingdom . In his exile Imru ' al @-@ Qais wandered with his group of rebellious friends from oasis to oasis , stopping to drink wine , and recite poetry , and enjoy the performance of the singing @-@ girls , sometimes tarrying for days before packing up to wander again . 
 Imru ' al @-@ Qais ' adventures with women also formed an important part of his early life , consisting according to some records of dozens of marriages , divorces and affairs , all ending badly for one reason or another . Imru ' al @-@ Qais ' lovers feature large in his poetry , as he praises their graces , lambasts their cruelty , and laments their absence and the longing in his heart . 
 = = The death of his father = = 
 Some stories tell that Imru ' al @-@ Qais was in his father 's army fighting the tribe of Asad when his father was slain , but this is not agreed by all the biographers . The most popular story comes to us from ibn al @-@ Kalbi ( d . 826 AD ) . Ibn al @-@ Kalbi holds that Imru ' al @-@ Qais was still in exile at the time of his father 's death , and that the news reached him while he was in the midst of a party with his friends . Upon hearing the news , he said " May God be merciful to my father . He let me stray when I was small , and now that I am grown he has burdened me with his blood . There will be no alertness today , and no drunkenness tomorrow , " followed by perhaps his most famous quote : " Today is for drink , and tomorrow for serious matters . " ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) 
 It is told that of all his father 's sons , Imru ' al @-@ Qais was the only one to take responsibility for avenging his father . One story tells that the tribe of Asad sent him an emissary and offered him three options — either that he kill one of their nobles to equal the death of his father , or that he accept a payment of thousands of sheep and camels , or that he make war on them , in which case they asked for one month to make ready . Imru ' al @-@ Qais chose the third option . The tribes of Bakr and Taghlib agreed to support him and fought with him against Asad , killing many Asad tribesmen . Bakr and Taghlib withdrew their support once they judged that enough of Asad had been killed to satisfy the requirements of revenge . 
 = = Exile and death = = 
 After exacting his revenge upon the tribe of Asad and losing the support of Bakr and Taghlib , Imru ' al @-@ Qais travelled all over the Arabian peninsula and the Levant , taking refuge with different tribes , running from his enemies and seeking support to regain his father 's kingship . His last journey was to Constantinople , to seek support from Emperor Justinian I. The Ghassanid prince Al @-@ Harith ibn Jabalah , Justinian 's north Arabian vassal , sponsored Imru ' al @-@ Qais in his appeal , and most accounts indicate that he won some promise of support from the Byzantine emperor , and perhaps even a contingent of troops . Some reports indicate that Justinian pressed the Negus of Axum to support Imru ' al @-@ Qais ' bid , but that he refused due to the ongoing feud between the <unk> Empire and the tribe of Kindah . 
 After leaving Constantinople , Imru ' al @-@ Qais travelled until he fell ill near the city of Ankara in modern @-@ day Turkey . He remained there until he died . There is a story which says that Emperor Justinian became angry with Imru ' al @-@ Qais after he left , and sent a messenger with a poisoned jacket , and that Imru ' al @-@ Qais wore the jacket and the poison killed him . This story says that Justinian was angry because he discovered that Imru ' al @-@ Qais had an affair with a woman in his court . 
 However , most historians downplay the likelihood of this account , in favor of the story that Imru ' al @-@ Qais actually died from a chronic skin disease , a disease which he mentioned in one of his poems . 
 The best estimates of the years of Imru ' al @-@ Qais ' embassy to Justinian and death in Anatolia are from 561 to 565 AD . It has been said that after the death of Imru ' al @-@ Qais the Greeks made a statue of him on his tomb that was still seen in 1262 AD , and that his tomb is nowadays located in <unk> , Ankara . 
 = = Poetic influences = = 
 Makki summarizes the accounts of the biographers in identifying three older poets who Imru ' al @-@ Qais could have met and learned from . The first was <unk> bin Janab al @-@ Kalbi , a well @-@ known poet who was a friend and drinking companion of his fathers ' . It is also possible that Imru ' al @-@ Qais learned from Abu Du 'ah al @-@ <unk> , and some accounts say that the young Imru ' al @-@ Qais was his reciter ( a poet 's disciple who would memorize all of his poems ) . A third possible poetic influence was a ' Amr bin <unk> 'ah who was a member of his father 's retinue , and was said to have later joined Imru ' al @-@ Qais ' retinue and accompanied him until his death . 
 = = Religion = = 
 Most historians in the centuries since Imru ' al @-@ Qais ' death have been content with the assumption that , as an Arab before the advent of Islam , he was pagan . More recently some researchers have called this view into question , most notably Louis <unk> ( c . 1898 ) , a Jesuit missionary , who insisted that Imru ' al @-@ Qais was a Christian . The evidence that <unk> cites to support his claim consists mostly of a handful of references to Christian practices and symbols in Imru ' al @-@ Qais ' poems , as well as a few instances of the Arabic word for ( the one ) God ( Allah ) . Other historians have said that references to Christianity can be explained by the presence of monasteries and missionaries along the northern frontier of the Arabian peninsula , and the fact that many Arabs would have been impressed by these scenes without necessarily converting themselves . It can be explained by the fact that Arabs have been close to Jewish tribes since ancient times , too ( <unk> helped the Juda kingdom during the Battle of <unk> ) because of their ethnic similarity and geographic proximity . Others have pointed out that the word " Allah " was in use by the pagan Arabs long before the advent of Islam , and merely referred to the high God ( above all the many others ) . 
 Imru ' al @-@ Qais may have been a Hanif . Makki reports that some historians have suggested Imru ' al @-@ Qais could have been influenced by the purported Mazdakism of his grandfather , but also states that , in his opinion , there is little direct evidence to support this . 
 = = Cultural impact = = 
 To this day Imru ' al @-@ Qays remains the best @-@ known of the pre @-@ Islamic poets , and has been a source of literary and national inspiration for Arabic intellectuals all the way into the 20th century . Opening his entry in the Dictionary of Literary Biography , Al @-@ Tahir Ahmad Makki says this about Imru ' al @-@ Qais : 
 The Prince @-@ Poet Imru ' al @-@ Qais , of the tribe of Kindah , is the first major Arabic literary figure . Verses from his Mu <unk> ( Hanging Poems ) , one of seven poems prized above all others by pre @-@ Islamic Arabs , are still in the 20th century the most <unk> possibly the most <unk> in all of Arabic literature . The Mu <unk> is also an integral part of the linguistic , poetic and cultural education of all Arabic speakers . 
 Ibn Sallam al @-@ <unk> ( d . 846 AD ) said of Imru ' al @-@ Qais in his " Generations of the Stallion Poets " ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) : 
 Imru ' al @-@ Qais was the originator of a great many things the Arabs considered beautiful , and which were adopted by other poets . These things include calling up his companions to halt , weeping over the ruins of abandoned campsites , describing his beloved with refinement and delicacy , and using language that was easy to understand . He was the first to compare women to gazelles and eggs , and to liken horses to birds of prey and to staves . He ' hobbled like a fleeing beast ' [ a reference to his famous description of his horse ] and separated the erotic prelude from the body of his poem . In the coining of <unk> , he surpassed everybody in his generation . 
 Some historians have emphasized the historical significance of the Kindah monarchy as the first attempt to unite the central Arabian tribes before the success of Islam , and Imru ' al @-@ Qais ' tragic place as one of the last Kindite princes . Others have focused on his colorful and violent life , putting it forward as an example of the immorality and brutality which existed in pre @-@ Islamic Arabia . 
 Iraqi writer <unk> al @-@ Samarra 'i ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> ) in his 1993 book Imru ' al @-@ Qais : Poet and Lover ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , calls Imru ' al @-@ Qais the " poet of freedom " : 
 The poet Imru ' al @-@ Qais had a gentle heart and a sensitive soul . He wanted the best not only for himself but for all the people of his society . The freedom that he struggled for was not confined to the romantic and erotic relations between him and his beloved Fatimah , and was not limited to his demands to lift the restrictions on sexual relations between men and women , but exceeded all this , so that he was singing for the freedom of all <unk> and from this point we are able to name him , the Poet of Freedom .

 The effects of Hurricane Georges in Louisiana included $ 30 @.@ 1 million in damage and three deaths . Forming from a tropical wave over the Atlantic Ocean , Georges attained a peak intensity of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) on September 20 , 1998 . Over the following several days , the storm tracked through the Greater Antilles and later entered the Gulf of Mexico on September 28 , the Category 2 storm made landfall in Mississippi before dissipating on October 1 . Before landfall , about 500 @,@ 000 residents in Louisiana evacuated from low @-@ lying areas . The mayor of New Orleans declared a state of emergency to allow federal assistance into the state . After nearly 1 @.@ 5 million people were urged to evacuate coastal areas , officials described the evacuation as " probably the largest [ ... ] we have ever achieved " . 
 Numerous homes located outside the levee system were flooded by the storm surge , and 85 fishing camps on the banks of Lake Pontchartrain were destroyed . An estimated 160 @,@ 000 residences were left without power due to Georges and severe beach erosion took place due to the slow movement of the hurricane . Precipitation statewide peaked at 2 @.@ 98 in ( 75 @.@ 69 mm ) in Bogalusa , and wind gusts reached 82 mph ( 132 km / h ) . In the wake of the hurricane , the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) opened 67 shelters throughout the state , and covered insurance claims totalling $ 14 @,@ 150 @,@ 532 , including from Puerto Rico and Mississippi . The Clinton administration appropriated $ 56 million in disaster relief to regions in Louisiana for recovery from Tropical Storm Frances and Hurricane Georges .

 Hurricane Georges began as a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa during mid @-@ September 1998 . Tracking westward , the wave spawned an area of low pressure two days later , which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression . On September 16 , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges , and to Hurricane Georges the next day . The storm reached its peak intensity on September 20 with winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) , just below Category 5 status on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . 
 Over the following five days , the hurricane tracked through the Greater Antilles , causing over 600 fatalities , primarily in the Dominican Republic and Haiti . By September 25 , Georges entered the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane . The storm made landfall three days later near Biloxi , Mississippi , with winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . Upon landfall , the hurricane 's forward motion slowed to an eastward drift . Georges dissipated on October 1 near the Atlantic coast of Florida . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 At 9 : 00 am Central Daylight Time ( CDT ) on September 25 , the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for coastal regions of Louisiana east of Morgan City . The following day , the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning when the storm neared landfall . A hurricane watch was also issued for areas between Morgan City and Intracoastal City . When forecasts indicated a landfall east of the state , the hurricane watch was canceled and the hurricane warning amended to a tropical storm warning . By September 29 , all tropical cyclone warnings and watches were discontinued . 
 During September 25 – 26 , large @-@ scale evacuations took place in response to forecasts suggesting a landfall near New Orleans . More than 1 @.@ 5 million people in New Orleans were advised to leave the city . The nine shelters opened throughout the area were collectively capable of accommodating up to 450 @,@ 000 people . New Orleans mayor Marc Morial declared a State of Emergency to allow federal assistance into the affected areas during the immediate aftermath of the hurricane . A curfew was instituted for those who ignored evacuation orders or could not leave the city . 
 Approximately 500 @,@ 000 people evacuated from Jefferson and Orleans Parishes in advance of the hurricane . Elsewhere , about 31 @,@ 000 others took refuge in shelters set up throughout the state . In Jefferson Parish , roughly 3 @,@ 900 people evacuated to public shelters , while 20 @,@ 000 temporarily moved to Orleans Parish , 14 @,@ 000 of whom were located in the Louisiana Superdome . In Plaquemines Parish , about 15 @,@ 000 residents evacuated and 2 @,@ 300 took refuge in public shelters . Grand Isle 's 1 @,@ 500 residents were ordered to evacuate for the fourth time in a month . Due to the large @-@ scale evacuations , 175 off @-@ duty state troopers and 250 national guard troops were deployed to help speed up the process . Only two highways , U.S. Route 90 and Interstate 10 lead in and out of New Orleans ; however , heavy rains from previous storms flooded parts of US 90 , hindering preparation efforts . Lt. Col. Ronnie Jones of the Louisiana state police noted that the evacuation was " probably the largest [ ... ] we have ever achieved " .

 Compared to the record @-@ breaking rainfall in Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida , Hurricane Georges produced relatively little precipitation in Louisiana , peaking at 2 @.@ 98 in ( 75 @.@ 69 mm ) in Bogalusa . The worst damages were confined to the southeastern portion of the state , concentrated in the Plaquemines and St. Bernard Parishes . A storm surge of 8 @.@ 9 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) was recorded in <unk> Bay before power at the recording station failed . Gale @-@ force winds impacted most of the parish and gusts peaked at 82 mph ( 132 km / h ) . The combination of high winds and surge cut power to most of the area and flooded at least 50 homes , all of which were located outside the levee system . A lighthouse on one island was partially submerged in the Gulf of Mexico , nearly 1 @,@ 200 feet ( 370 m ) from land following severe beach erosion . Six @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) sand dunes on the islands were completely eroded by the storm , leaving boardwalks formerly situated atop the dunes suspended near the water 's surface . 
 In St. Tammany Parish , the storm 's effects were mainly limited to wind damage : gusts reached 48 mph ( 77 km / h ) , knocking down trees and power lines . A storm surge of 4 @.@ 3 ft ( 1 @.@ 3 m ) flooded 20 homes in the parish . Winds in Jefferson Parish gusted up to 55 mph ( 88 km / h ) , causing minor roof damage and power outages . In Orleans Parish , a storm surge of 5 @.@ 81 ft ( 1 @.@ 77 m ) destroyed 85 fishing camps constructed on wooden pilings .

 Before Hurricane Georges , FEMA issued disaster declarations for Ascension , Assumption , Jefferson , Lafourche , Livingston , Plaquemines , Orleans , St. Bernard , St. Charles , St. James , St. John the Baptist , St. Tammany , <unk> , Tangipahoa , and Washington Parishes . The declaration allowed residents to receive individual and public assistance .

The Clinton administration appropriated $ 56 million in post @-@ disaster funds for regions impacted Tropical Storm Frances and Hurricane Georges in Louisiana . 
 Throughout the state , officials opened 67 shelters and deployed 1 @,@ 200 FEMA personnel to Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , Florida and Georgia . The day after Georges made landfall , 4 @,@ 000 of the 14 @,@ 000 residents who evacuated to the Louisiana Superdome returned to their homes ; however , Mayor Marc Morial requested that the residents stay in the <unk> for their own safety . In attempts to prevent major flooding in the aftermath of Georges , the United States National Guard provided the Gulf Coast with 1 @.@ 25 million sandbags . Rescue teams flew nearly 50 missions in response to calls for help from stranded residents . The United Methodist Committee on Relief deployed its disaster response team on September 29 to the state to assess damages wrought by Georges . Thomas <unk> , a United States Geological Survey ecologist , surveyed the islands following the storm and stated that " the single most important line of defense standing between New Orleans and future hurricanes had all but disappeared " . 
 = Cyclone Fantala = 
 Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Fantala was the strongest tropical cyclone of the south @-@ west Indian Ocean in terms of sustained winds . Part of the 2015 – 16 cyclone season , Fantala formed on 11 April to the south of Diego Garcia , an island in the central Indian Ocean . With a ridge to the south , the storm moved westward for several days while gaining strength , aided by warm waters and decreasing wind shear . Late on 17 April , the Météo @-@ France office on Réunion ( MFR ) estimated peak 10 @-@ minute winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) , making Fantala the strongest tropical cyclone of the basin in terms of 10 @-@ minute sustained winds . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) estimated peak 1 @-@ minute winds of 280 km / h ( 175 mph ) , equivalent to Category 5 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale and tied only with Agnielle from November 1995 as the strongest on record in the south @-@ west Indian Ocean . 
 While near peak intensity , Fantala passed near the Farquhar Group of the Seychelles , damaging most of the buildings in the small archipelago . By 18 April , Fantala had weakened to an intense tropical cyclone and slowed its forward motion , eventually reversing its direction of movement . After fluctuating in strength , the disorganized system reversed direction again , making its closest approach to Madagascar . Fantala degenerated into a remnant low on 24 April , and the remnants continued toward Tanzania . There , heavy rainfall resulted in flooding that washed away roads and houses , killing 13 people . Rains extended further into Kenya , with similar effects . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 An area of disturbed weather persisted as of 9 April to the southeast of Diego Garcia . The system moved generally westwards , steered by a ridge , and a low @-@ level circulation gradually became more defined . Limiting factors to faster development included poor inflow and moderate wind shear , although associated convection became more organized . At 06 : 00 UTC on 11 April , the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center Météo @-@ France in La Réunion ( MFR ) classified the system as Tropical Disturbance 8 about 600 km ( 375 mi ) south of Diego Garcia . Six hours later , the agency upgraded the system to a tropical depression . At 13 : 00 UTC on 11 April , the American @-@ based Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert , noting the increased organization of the convection , circulation , and outflow . Later that day , the MFR upgraded the depression to Moderate Tropical Storm Fantala , and the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 19S . By that time , the convection was quickly consolidating around the center , organizing into a circular central dense overcast . 
 On 12 April , the previously detrimental wind shear began easing , allowing the structure to become more symmetric . On that day , an eye feature began developing in the center of Fantala , indicative of strengthening . At 12 : 00 UTC on 12 April , the MFR upgraded Fantala to severe tropical storm status , and six hours later , the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane , with 1 minute maximum sustained winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) ; rapid strengthening was prevented by the entrainment of nearby dry air , although the core of convection continued to contract . At 06 : 00 UTC on 13 April , the MFR upgraded Fantala to tropical cyclone status , with 10 minute winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . By that time , the eye feature persisted , consisting of a warm area within the deepest convection , although the dry air in the region prevented quicker strengthening . 
 By early on 14 April , the eye became better defined after an eyewall replacement cycle . The intensity fluctuated after outflow decreased to the north , although increasingly warm waters favored further intensification . Early on 15 April , the MFR upgraded Fantala to an intense tropical cyclone , while the storm was undergoing rapid deepening . The outflow was enhanced by a large upper @-@ level low well to the southeast , and shear had decreased to a minimum . After reaching an initial peak intensity with 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) at 12 : 00 UTC that day , Fantala 's intensity leveled off for the following 48 hours , with its 10 @-@ minute sustained winds fluctuating between 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) and 215 km / h ( 130 mph ) . Meanwhile , the JTWC estimated 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) for the first 6 hours of this time period , 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) for the following 24 hours , and 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) for the remaining 18 hours , all equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane , with the latter two wind estimates equivalent to a western Pacific super typhoon . 
 On 16 April , Fantala turned more to the west @-@ northward toward the southern islands of the Seychelles , steered by a strengthening ridge near Madagascar . Intensification resumed by 12 : 00 UTC the following day , with the JTWC estimating 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) , classifying Fantala as a Category 5 @-@ equivalent cyclone on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . Around 15 : 00 UTC , the cyclone moved through the Farquhar Group of the Seychelles , and its eyewall moved over several small islands . At 18 : 00 UTC on 17 April , the MFR upgraded Fantala to a very intense tropical cyclone ; based on a Dvorak rating of <unk> , the satellite @-@ derived wind estimate was 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) , along with an estimated barometric pressure of 910 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @.@ 87 inHg ) . However , in the best track for Fantala , the MFR concluded that Fantala had been a very intense tropical cyclone 6 hours earlier as well , with 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) , and that its minimum central pressure of 910 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @.@ 87 inHg ) had occurred 12 hours later , at 06 : 00 UTC the following day . The JTWC also estimated peak 1 minute winds of 280 km / h ( 175 mph ) . 
 While maintaining peak intensity , Fantala slowed its forward movement as the ridge to its south over Madagascar weakened . The cyclone turned back to the southeast due to the building influence of a ridge to the northeast , and the storm retraced its former path . Cooler waters along its path – the result of upwelling – as well as another eyewall replacement cycle , caused Fantala to weaken to an intense tropical cyclone by 19 April . Fantala had maintained at least Category 4 @-@ equivalent intensity for about 90 hours , and of those 90 hours , about 30 were at both very intense tropical cyclone status and Category 5 @-@ equivalent intensity . That day , the eye disappeared on satellite imagery and the storm deteriorated further to tropical cyclone status . The eye redeveloped on 20 April , with pronounced outflow assisting in the re @-@ intensification , although increased shear resulted in weakening again on 21 April . That day , the MFR downgraded Fantala to a severe tropical storm . The structure improved again on 22 April as the system stalled due to the building ridge to the south . At 00 : 00 UTC that day , the MFR upgraded Fantala to an intense tropical cyclone once the eye became more pronounced again , only to downgrade it to tropical cyclone status by 06 : 00 UTC , though this was pushed back to 12 : 00 UTC in the best track . A small area of convection persisted over the center , although dry air in the region continued to weaken the thunderstorms . 
 The MFR again downgraded Fantala to a severe tropical storm on 23 April as the storm began drifting to the northwest . Increasing wind shear weakened Fantala further to a moderate tropical storm that day , and on 24 April , both the JTWC and MFR issued their final advisories ; the latter agency had first downgraded it to a tropical depression . By that time , the circulation was exposed from the convection as Fantala moved over cooled waters where it traversed a few days prior . The circulation continued to the northwest , with occasional flares of convection . By 27 April , a circulation was no longer present as the convective remnants of Fantala approached the coastline of Tanzania .

 Cyclone Fantala first threatened Agaléga , part of the Outer Islands of Mauritius . Government officials forced all 72 residents on the South Island to evacuate to the North Island , and strongly advised fishermen to avoid sailing . 
 Fantala was the first tropical cyclone to threaten the Farquhar Group since Cyclone Bondo in 2006 . Most of the 34 residents on Farquhar Atoll evacuated ahead of the storm , and those that remained behind were uninjured . While moving through the Seychelles near peak intensity , Fantala had estimated 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) , and days later it moved through the region again with 10 @-@ minute sustained winds estimated at 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . Based on satellite imagery , it was estimated that of the 50 structures on Farquhar Atoll , 19 were destroyed and 27 sustained severe damage . Only four buildings , which were constructed to be cyclone @-@ proof after Bondo , withstood the estimated 350 km / h ( 220 mph ) gusts , even then suffering moderate damage . In addition , many of the island 's trees were knocked down . Due to the storm 's prolonged passage through the island group , the Seychelles government declared the Farquhar islands as a disaster area on 20 April . In a visit to the Seychelles , United Nations Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon stated that the country has become " highly vulnerable to storm surges , as we are reminded by the recent devastating effects of Cyclone Fantala . " A World Bank survey team found $ 4 @.@ 5 million in damage . The lodge on the island is not expected to be rebuilt until March 2017 , about 11 months after the storm . 
 The remnants of Fantala spurred warnings from the Tanzania Meteorological Agency after the storm produced heavy rainfall . In Kilimanjaro Region , the rains caused flooding that covered roads and entered houses , trapping hundreds of residents and killing eight . Officials required helicopters from nearby Kilimanjaro National Park to rescue residents . Five people were killed in the country 's <unk> Region , all drowning in flooded rivers . The overflowing Umba River isolated several villages . In the region , 13 @,@ 933 people were left homeless after 315 houses were washed away . Flooding also washed away 12 @,@ 073 ha ( 29 @,@ 830 acres ) of crop fields , prompting officials to purchase and distribute maize , beans , and cooking oil to affected residents . The storm also sent a plume of moisture northward to Kenya , where storm @-@ influenced rainfall reached 133 mm ( 5 @.@ 2 in ) in Kwale in just four hours . This resulted in flooding in coastal portions of Kenya that destroyed several houses . About 10 @,@ 000 ha ( 25 @,@ 000 acres ) of crop fields were flooded . The port and several roads were closed in the city of Mombasa , Kenya 's second @-@ largest city . 
 The MFR 's estimate of peak 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) made Fantala the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the south @-@ west Indian Ocean by that measure . According to estimates from the JTWC , Fantala attained peak 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 280 km / h ( 175 mph ) , tied only with Cyclone Agnielle from November 1995 as the strongest cyclone on record in the south @-@ west Indian Ocean . Reliable satellite @-@ based intensity estimates date back to 1990 . The storm was fueled by the powerful 2014 – 16 El Niño event , which also contributed to the record intensities of Hurricane Patricia in the northeastern Pacific Ocean and Cyclone Winston in the southern Pacific Ocean .

 K Dash ( <unk> ・ <unk> , Kei <unk> , commonly stylized as K ′ and also known as K Prime in certain English language materials ) , is a video game character from The King of Fighters fighting game series developed by SNK . He debuted as the leader of the Hero Team in The King of Fighters ' 99 , released in 1999 . He stars as the reluctant hero in the NESTS syndicate story arc of the series . He was created to be a " dark hero " in contrast to the series ' previous protagonist Kyo Kusanagi . 
 K ′ is a young man who lost all his memories when the NESTS syndicate captured him and injected the DNA of the powerful fighter Kyo into him to copy Kusanagi 's pyrokinetic abilities . Angered by what NESTS did to him , K ' betrays NESTS and decides to destroy them for using his body and deleting all his memories . Although he hates tournaments , K ' uses the King of Fighters tournaments to find NESTS members and defeat them . In his search , he meets allies who have the same goal and joins forces with them . Aside from the main series , K ' also appears in several other media series , such as spin @-@ offs and crossover video games , as well as printed adaptations of the series . 
 Since his introduction in the series , K ' has received both praise and criticism by video game publications . The character 's gameplay has been praised for its style and differences from previous known fighting styles . His absence in The King of Fighters XII was controversial and his return in the following game was due mainly to his popularity as a character . 
 = = Conception and creation = = 
 To contrast the previous protagonist of the series , Kyo Kusanagi , K ' was made to be the " dark hero " . During the early phases of the development of The King of Fighters ' 99 , the introduction of K ' to the series was meant to remove popular characters Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami from the roster — though this idea was scrapped before the game 's release . Eiji , one of the game 's designers , commented that he thought K ' would be more popular than he turned out to be , noting that K ' was too plain . Nevertheless , character designer Tatsuhiko <unk> , better known as " Falcoon " , said K ' was one of his favorite original King of Fighters characters . Music composer Sha @-@ V suggested that K ' should yell " Dora ! " or " Ora ! " to mirror Kyo and Iori 's shouts , " <unk> ! " and " <unk> ! " respectively . <unk> , another music composer , jokingly wondered if K ' is trying to say the word " dry " , since the first word of his yell was " <unk> ! " 
 It has been noted by several of the series ' designers that K ' is one of the most difficult characters to illustrate , since his look is very different when he is drawn by different illustrators . In the early development of the game , K ' had a slicked back hairstyle , but as it was nixed by his powers , the character 's hair was changed . They also jokingly mentioned that the reason for his hair being bushier than it needed to be may be a reflection of the conditions around him . The King of Fighters ' 99 was developed at the same time as Garou : Mark of the Wolves ; developers noted several similarities between K ' and Mark of the Wolves ' main character , Rock Howard , which caused K ' ' s designer to become very nervous . The producer of The King of Fighters 2002 : Unlimited Match , <unk> Hakase , advised advanced players to use K ' stating that once the player had learned how to control him , the character would become very strong during fights . 
 For The King of Fighters XIII , K ' ' s design was crafted so that he had a " cool " appearance . Developers liked the result as his moves , such as putting on his sunglasses , were carefully detailed . His gameplay mechanics were developed so that gamers who had used him before would not find his new gameplay mechanics strange . In contrast to Kyo 's flames , K ' ' s were designed with intention of making them look more violent . As a result of various The King of Fighters endings showing K ' removing his red glove , a special move was required to show him doing the same thing . After thinking of several methods that would show this , the staff was inspired by The King of Fighters HK Comics printed adaptations in which the character 's glove once broke after defeating his opponent , leading to his <unk> that happens only after he has used his strongest technique . Following various revisions of K ' ' s " Chain Drive " ( <unk> ) technique , in order to better follow the material that inspired the move , the staff decided to make K ' fight while wearing his sunglasses . 
 = = = Attributes = = = 
 K ' is a former subject of an experiment made by the NESTS organization . He stands <unk> ( 6 ' 0 " ) tall and weighs <unk> ( 143 lbs ) . In their attempt to create powerful soldiers , NESTS kidnapped K ′ and injected him with DNA from the fighter Kyo Kusanagi , giving him his pyrokinetic skills . Unlike Kyo , K ' is only able to create fire from his right hand , which he is sometimes unable to control . He wears a glove to protect his body from being burned accidentally . During the program , NESTS repressed K ′ ' s memories , and he was made to believe that he was Krizalid 's clone . While in NESTS , K ′ became enraged with how the organization played with human lives , and escaped to recover his memories . As he could not even remember his name , K ' decided to destroy NESTS in order to stop their experiments . K ' ' s fighting style is simply called Pure Violence which involves him using the fire from his right hand along with martial arts moves . 
 In the process of destroying NESTS , he becomes allied with Maxima , a cyborg whose best friend was killed by NESTS agents and is seeking to avenge the death . While Maxima sees K ' as a friend and his partner , K ' is stoic and cynical . He also meets Whip , who it is revealed is a clone of his sister , <unk> . Even though Whip reveals her identity to K ' , he ignores this , saying he will do what he pleases . Although he hates The King of Fighters tournaments , he commonly enters them , being asked by someone , or to find NESTS . The participants often criticize him for being antisocial . After destroying NESTS , K ' starts recovering his memories , but he suspects he could forget all the people he has met . He also becomes determined to prove he is better than Kyo , instead of being only a clone .

 The character K ' has been well received by fans ; in a 2005 poll by SNK Playmore USA , he was voted the fans ' fourth favorite character , with a total of 338 votes . His character has also been used as the mascot for The King of Fighters 's 15th anniversary . He has received praise and criticism from several video game publications and other media . Scott <unk> from <unk> labelled him a " lame " addition to the character roster in The King of Fighters ' 99 . Andres Rojas from Nintendo World Report referred to K ' as " a fighter not to be reckoned with " as well as a comical " Michael Jackson wannabe " . 1UP.com praised K ' as among the most inspired new character designs in The King of Fighters series since Iori Yagami in The King of Fighters ' 95 , noting his unique fighting style : merely " Violence " which contrasted with other known fighting styles . Additionally , 1UP.com noted that anything involving the character 's sunglasses qualified as the best pose from the game . Similarly , Josh Kramer of Thunderbolt praised K ' ' s design alongside Iori . In another review , Jeremy Dunham of IGN noted that <unk> had re @-@ voiced K ' in The King of Fighters 2001 for PlayStation 2 , listing the character among those that provided " plenty of old @-@ school enjoyment " . <unk> Games commented that K ' appears in a " fun to watch " CG movie in KOF : Maximum Impact 2 , even though " neither of these movies actually make any sense at all " . 
 Critics have also commented on the character 's role in the printed adaptations of the franchise . A. E. Sparrow , reviewing the graphic novel King of Fighters 2003 : Volume 4 for IGN , commented that K ' is " sufficiently heroic " with the comic allowing the exploration of his motivations . His duel against Kyo 's clone , Kusanagi , was referred by <unk> as " fan @-@ only territory " due to the lack of context . His relationship with his partner Maxima is described as : " hard to tell friend from rival in a story like this , especially for one who is unfamiliar with the game . " Reviewing volume five , Mania Entertainment 's Ben Leary said the K ' <unk> storyline makes " one of the wildest transitions I 've seen in a comic yet " with K ' involved in a conflict related to Japanese mythology for no apparent reason . However , he said that the way K ' receives new powers to defeat Mukai is " self @-@ contradictory " and that " nothing really happens as a result " of this event . 
 On the official SNK Playmore King of Fighters anniversary website , an image of K ' drawn in the style of the other The King of Fighters XII participants appeared , along with a similar image of Mai Shiranui , leading to speculation that they would appear in the game . UTV Ignition Entertainment 's business development director Shane Bettenhausen refused to answer these rumors , but noted fans asked more often about Mai 's absence . None of them made it into the game which caused discontent within gamers . In an official press releases by Atlus regarding The King of Fighters XIII , it was stated that K ' ' s return was because of popular demand . His return along with his two teammates , Maxima and Kula , as well as Mai , has been met with praise by video game publications . 
 Merchandising based on K ' has been released including action figures and clothing for cosplaying .

 Grand Theft Auto clone is a subgenre of open world action @-@ adventure video games , characterized by their likeness to the Grand Theft Auto series in either gameplay , or overall design . These types of open world games are games in which players may find and use a variety of vehicles and weapons while roaming freely in an open world setting . The objective of such games is to complete a sequence of core missions involving driving and shooting , but often side @-@ missions and minigames are added to improve replay value . The storylines of games in this subgenre typically have strong themes of crime and violence . 
 The subgenre has its origins in open @-@ world action adventure games popularized in Europe ( and particularly the United Kingdom ) throughout the 1980s and 1990s . The release of Grand Theft Auto ( 1997 ) marked a major commercial success for open @-@ ended game design in North America , and featured a more marketable crime theme . But it was the popularity of its 3D sequel Grand Theft Auto III in 2001 that led to the widespread propagation of a more specific set of gameplay conventions consistent with a subgenre . The subgenre now includes many games from different developers all over the world where the player can control wide ranges of vehicles and weapons . The subgenre has evolved with greater levels of environmental detail and more realistic behaviors . 
 Since calling a game a " clone " usually has a negative connotation , reviewers have come up with other names for the subgenre . Names such as " sandbox games " , however , are applied to a wider range of games that do not share key features of the Grand Theft Auto series . 
 = = Definition = = 
 A Grand Theft Auto clone is a video game that falls within the genre popularized by the 2001 title Grand Theft Auto III , where players are given the ability to drive any vehicle or fire any weapon as they explore an open world . These games are sometimes treated as a 3D action @-@ adventure game , or third @-@ person shooter . They are noted for frequently bearing strong violent or criminal themes , though exceptions like American McGee Presents : <unk> have copied its gameplay and structure with a Teen rating . 
 = = = Other terminology = = = 
 Calling a game a " Grand Theft Auto clone " is sometimes considered unfair or insulting . This is because reviewers sometimes use this term to suggest that the " clone " is a mere imitation , which commonly occurs in the video game industry , designed for the sole purpose of capitalizing on the success of the Grand Theft Auto series . However , this term can also be used as a neutral description of a game , which can range from good to bad . Reviewers have used " Grand Theft Auto clone " to describe games that rest on their own merits , and do not necessarily dismiss the entire class of games as mere imitators . 
 Games of this type are sometimes defined under the broader terminology " open world games " or " sandbox games " . However , many games that predate Grand Theft Auto III , such as Metroid from 1986 , are also called open world games . <unk> , games such as Grand Theft Auto III and Body Harvest are credited with inventing this genre more than a decade later . Furthermore , reviewers have stated that this genre does not include every game with a freely explorable world and that this genre is much more specific , thus excluding the free @-@ roaming titles Spider @-@ Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk : Ultimate Destruction from this class of games . The terminology is inconsistent , sometimes including any game with open level design , while other times focusing on a specific genre created at the turn of the century . 
 Without clear classifications to describe the genre popularized by Grand Theft Auto , reviewers have created a number of alternate names for this genre . Some reviewers have focused on the pervasive criminal themes and content in the genre , using terminology such as " crime games " , " crime @-@ based action games " , and what CNN called the " gangsta genre " . Other journalists have emphasized gameplay by describing the genre as " free roaming action adventure games " , " driving @-@ and @-@ shooting games " , and " driving action hybrids " . 
 = = Game design = = 
 = = = Driving and shooting = = = 
 Grand Theft Auto clones offer players the ability to steal and drive a number of vehicles . Games have included all kinds of vehicles , such as cars , helicopters , boats , jet @-@ skis , fixed @-@ wing aircraft , and military vehicles . Reviewers have compared these games based on the number of vehicles they offer , with greater choice resulting in better reviews . Players can also use vehicles as weapons , either by driving into enemies , or by damaging the vehicle until it explodes . Some games allow vehicles to perform stunts . Games in the genre thus incorporate elements of driving simulation games . Some games even allow players to customize their vehicles . 
 Players can engage in combat using range of weapons depending on the game setting , such as assault weapons , sniper rifles , explosives , rocket launchers , and close @-@ range melee weapons . As such , several reviewers have stated that games in this genre are partially third person shooters . Players can find weapons scattered throughout the game world , and may buy weapons in shops or take them from dead enemies . Virtually anyone in the game world can be attacked by the player . In many games , excessive violent behavior will provoke a reaction by police authorities , who the player may then choose to fight or evade . Players must also keep track of their health and ammunition in order to succeed in combat . 
 These games have employed a variety of aiming mechanisms , such as free look aiming or a " lock @-@ on " button . Several games have been criticized for difficult or burdensome controls when it comes to shooting , and thus video game designers have tried refine the aiming and shooting controls in these games . 
 = = = Open world and missions = = = 
 Grand Theft Auto clones allow players to freely explore the game world , which is typically on the scale of an entire city . Some games base their level design on real world cities , such as London , New York City , and Los Angeles . Players are usually able to navigate by vehicle or on foot . Some games put greater emphasis on leaping , climbing , and even swimming . Exploring the world is not just necessary to complete objectives , but also to gain valuable items , weapons , and vehicles . Different parts of the game world may be controlled by different enemy factions , who will attempt to stop the player in a variety of ways . However , more recent games in this genre allow players to acquire their own territory . The freedom of navigating a huge game world may be overwhelming or confusing for new players . Game designers have come up with a variety of navigational aids to solve this problem . A mini @-@ map feature is common , while Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto IV go so far as to offer a GPS service . Games without these navigation tools are sometimes criticized as confusing . 
 The player 's freedom to explore may be limited until they complete certain objectives and advance the game plot . Players must visit specific locations and complete specific missions in order to win the game , such as racing , tailing , couriering , robbing , stealing , shooting , assassinating , and driving to specific checkpoints . There may be multiple ways to complete these missions as the game environment is designed to facilitate shortcuts , experimentation , and creative ways to kill enemies . Completing a core mission will unlock further missions and advance the storyline , and if the player fails a mission they will be able to resume the game from before the mission began . In addition , these games usually offer optional side missions , which allow players to gain other rewards . These side missions improve the game 's replay value . These games are also known for incorporating numerous minigames into the game world , such as circuit races . Ultimately , this allows the player to follow or ignore the game 's storyline as they see fit .

 Open @-@ world , 3D action @-@ adventure games existed for years prior to the release of any similar game from the Scottish developer DMA Design . Mercenary ( 1985 ) has been described as a major ancestor to the Grand Theft Auto series , because it featured an open world which the player could explore freely . The Terminator , released in 1990 , was a free @-@ form , open @-@ world game that set its action in a modern @-@ day city that extended for miles , and included the ability to fire at civilians and steal cars . This game was also among the first American @-@ developed games to feature these elements . 
 Hunter ( 1991 ) has been described as the first sandbox game featuring full 3D , third @-@ person graphics , thus making it an important precursor to the Grand Theft Auto series . The game consisted of a large , open world in which there were numerous possibilities to complete different missions . The character could travel on foot , or steal different vehicles such as cars , tanks , or even bicycles , boats , helicopters and hovercrafts . Moreover , Hunter also had many unique features such as day and night lighting , fuel modelling , a log book , aerial observation units , tank traps , land mines and computer @-@ controlled rocket batteries and tracer guns . It was also possible to ride a bicycle , swim , <unk> or even make a parachute jump from a helicopter . 
 DMA Design began pursuing open @-@ world game design with the first Grand Theft Auto , which allowed players to commandeer various automobiles and shoot various weapons within a mission @-@ based structure . Unlike later games in the series , and indeed many earlier influences , the first two GTA games were 2D . In 1998 , DMA moved many of these design concepts into a 3D world , with Body Harvest , a Nintendo 64 game developed by DMA Design ( which eventually became Rockstar North when it was acquired by Rockstar Games ) . This title featured an open world with nonlinear missions and side @-@ quests , as well as the ability to commandeer and drive a variety of vehicles . As such , it has been retroactively called " GTA in space " ( despite the fact that the entire game takes place in various settings on earth ) , and is credited with making Grand Theft Auto III possible . Dan Houser has also cited the 3D Mario and Zelda games on the Nintendo 64 as major influences . Another important influence came from the Driver series , which was created in 1999 , with its open city environments and being cited as the first driving game to allow the player to go anywhere in the map . 
 Grand Theft Auto III took the gameplay foundation of the first two Grand Theft Auto games and expanded it into a 3D world , and offered an unprecedented variety of minigames and side @-@ missions . The title was a much greater commercial success than its direct precursors , and its influence was profound . As such , Grand Theft Auto III is credited with popularizing this genre , let alone inventing it . Its release is sometimes treated as a revolutionary event in the history of video games , much like the release of Doom nearly a decade earlier . GamePro called it the most important game of all time , and claimed that every genre was influenced to rethink their conventional level design . IGN similarly praised it as one of the top ten most influential games of all time . Subsequent games that follow this formula of driving and shooting in a free @-@ roaming level have been called Grand Theft Auto clones . 
 Other critics , however , likened Grand Theft Auto III to The Legend of Zelda and Metroid , as well as Shenmue in particular , and noted how GTA III had combined elements from previous games and fused them together into a new immersive experience . For instance , radio stations had been implemented earlier in games such as Sega 's Out Run ( 1986 ) and Maxis ' <unk> ( 1996 ) , open @-@ ended missions based on operating a taxi cab in a sandbox environment were the basis for Sega 's Crazy Taxi ( 1999 ) , the ability to kill non @-@ player characters dated back to action role @-@ playing games like <unk> II ( 1985 ) , and Final Fantasy Adventure ( 1991 ) , and the way in which players run over pedestrians and get chased by police has been compared to Pac @-@ Man ( 1980 ) .

 Rockstar North developed Grand Theft Auto : Vice City in 2002 , which expanded on the open world concept by letting players explore the interior of more than sixty buildings . The game featured an expanded soundtrack and the voice talent of several Hollywood actors , including Ray Liotta . This set a new standard for the genre , making studio talent a pre @-@ requisite for success . Other game developers entered the field that year , with releases such as The Getaway . The Simpsons : Hit & Run in 2003 applied the concept to a cartoon world , while True Crime : Streets of LA reversed the Grand Theft Auto formula by putting the player in the role of a police officer . Even the Driver series , which influenced Grand Theft Auto III , began to follow this formula by combining driving and shooting in <unk> . Some reviewers began warning parents of the growing number of games in this genre , due to the violent themes intended for mature audiences . 
 Ultimately , rival developers were unable to match the reception of the Grand Theft Auto series . Rockstar North released Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas in 2004 , which featured an open world on the scale of three distinct cities . The game also allowed players to customize the player @-@ character and vehicles , as well as compete for turf by fighting with rival gangs . The continued success of the Grand Theft Auto series led to successful spin @-@ offs , including Grand Theft Auto : Liberty City Stories in 2005 , Grand Theft Auto : Vice City Stories in 2006 , and the 2D Grand Theft Auto Advance for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console . A market analysis in early 2006 found that new games in this genre would have more difficulty than new first @-@ person shooters or racing games , and noted that that overall revenue for this genre declines during periods without a new Grand Theft Auto game . By 2006 , developers were producing fewer games in this space , estimated at half the number seen in 2005 . City Racing developed by EA Group and published by <unk> continues to be wildly popular GTA clone , despite the complete lack of storyline . 
 With the arrival of the seventh generation of video game consoles , the first " next @-@ gen " Grand Theft Auto clones were released in 2006 , beginning with Saints Row from 2006 and Crackdown from 2007 both introduced online multiplayer to the genre , a feature that had been requested by many fans . Crackdown attracted attention for being created by David Jones , the developer of the original Grand Theft Auto , and featured the ability to develop the player character 's superpowers in a semi @-@ futuristic setting . Meanwhile , The Godfather : The Game and Scarface : The World Is Yours entered the market in 2006 , and attempted to apply the Grand Theft Auto formula to popular movie franchises . Still , reviewers continued to measure these games against the standard set by the Grand Theft Auto series . Grand Theft Auto IV was released in April 2008 and featured a large , detailed environment , redefining gameplay and even adopted the GPS navigation system seen in Saints Row . The game broke numerous sales records , including the record for the fastest selling game in its first 24 hours . Since its inception , this genre has evolved to include larger settings , more missions , and a wider range of vehicles . In 2010 Rockstar Games published Red Dead Redemption , an open world Western themed game . On the day of Grand Theft Auto V ' s release on September 17 , 2013 , Volition released a free downloadable content pack for Saints Row IV titled " <unk> " , purposely playing the similarity in the abbreviated titles to promote their game due to the confusion raised on various social networks . 
 = HMS Cygnet ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Cygnet was a C @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s . The ship was initially assigned to the Home Fleet , although she was temporarily deployed in the Red Sea during the Abyssinia Crisis of 1935 – 36 . Cygnet was sold to the Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) in late 1937 and renamed HMCS St. Laurent . She was stationed on the west coast of Canada when World War II began in September 1939 , and had to be transferred to the Atlantic coast for convoy escort duties . She served as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic and participated in the sinking of two German submarines . The ship was on anti @-@ submarine patrols during the invasion of Normandy , and was employed as a troop transport after VE Day for returning Canadian servicemen . St. Laurent was decommissioned in late 1945 and scrapped in 1947 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Cygnet displaced 1 @,@ 375 long tons ( 1 @,@ 397 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 865 long tons ( 1 @,@ 895 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 329 feet ( 100 @.@ 3 m ) , a beam of 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 36 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 27 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers . Cygnet carried a maximum of 473 long tons ( 481 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 5 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 200 km ; 6 @,@ 300 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 145 officers and men . 
 The ship mounted four 45 @-@ calibre 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mk IX guns in single mounts , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' from front to rear . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Cygnet had a single QF 3 @-@ inch 20 cwt AA gun between her funnels , and two 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) QF 2 @-@ pounder Mk II AA guns mounted on the aft end of her forecastle deck . The 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) AA gun was removed in 1936 and the 2 @-@ pounders were relocated to between the funnels . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch torpedoes . Three depth @-@ charge chutes were fitted , each with a capacity of two depth charges . After World War II began this was increased to 33 depth charges , delivered by one or two rails and two throwers . 
 The ship was ordered on 15 July 1930 from Vickers @-@ Armstrongs , Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness under the 1929 Programme . Cygnet was laid down on 1 December 1930 , launched on 29 September 1931 , as the 14th ship to carry the name , and completed on 1 April 1932 . 
 = = Service history = = 
 After the ship commissioned on 9 April 1932 , she was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet . Cygnet spent a lot of time in dockyard hands during her first two years of service . She was repaired at Devonport in November 1932 – January 1933 , March – May , July – August and November 1933 – January 1934 before deploying to the West Indies with the Home Fleet between January and March 1934 . The ship required more repairs upon her return in April – May and then a refit from 25 July to 31 August 1934 . Cygnet was detached from the Home Fleet during the Abyssinian Crisis , and deployed in the Red Sea from September 1935 to April 1936 . The ship returned to the UK in April 1936 and refitted at Devonport between 20 April and 18 June before resuming duty with the Home Fleet . In July – August she was deployed for patrol duties off the Spanish coast in the Bay of Biscay to intercept shipping carrying contraband goods to Spain and to protect British @-@ flagged shipping during the first stages of the Spanish Civil War .

 Together with her sister HMS Crescent , Cygnet was sold to Canada on 20 October 1936 for a total price of £ 400 @,@ 000 . She was refitted again to meet Canadian standards , including the installation of Type 124 ASDIC , and handed over on 1 February 1937 . The ship was renamed as HMCS St. Laurent and commissioned into the RCN on 17 February . St. Laurent was assigned to Halifax , Nova Scotia and arrived there in May . She remained there for a year before she was transferred to Esquimalt in 1938 . The ship remained there until she was ordered to the East Coast on 31 August 1939 , arriving at Halifax on 18 September . St. Laurent escorted local convoys while based there , including the convoy carrying half of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to the UK on 10 December . The ship was ordered to Plymouth on 24 May 1940 and arrived there on 31 May . Upon arrival , the ship 's rear torpedo tube mount was removed and replaced by a 12 @-@ pounder AA gun and the 2 @-@ pounders were exchanged for quadruple Mark I mounts for the QF 0 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Vickers Mark III machine gun . 
 On 9 June , St. Laurent was ordered to Le Havre , France to evacuate British troops , but none were to be found and the ship evacuated a small group of French soldiers further up the coast on 11 June . The ship was taken under fire by a German artillery battery near Saint @-@ Valery @-@ en @-@ Caux , but she was not hit and Lieutenant Commander H.G. DeWolf , the ship 's captain , ordered her to return fire although no results were noted . After returning to England , St. Laurent escorted several troop convoys on the last legs of their journeys from Canada , Australia and New Zealand in mid @-@ June and was assigned to escort duties with Western Approaches Command afterwards . 
 On 2 July , whilst escorting the British battleship Nelson , St. Laurent received word that the unescorted British passenger ship SS Arandora Star had been torpedoed by U @-@ 47 , about 125 nautical miles ( 232 km ; 144 mi ) northeast of Malin Head , Ireland . Arriving some four and a half hours after the ocean liner sank , the ship rescued 857 survivors , including German and Italian prisoners of war . Together with the British sloop Sandwich , she badly damaged the German submarine U @-@ 52 whilst defending Convoy HX 60 on 4 August . On 2 December , St. Laurent rescued survivors from the armed merchant cruiser HMS Forfar that had been torpedoed and sunk by U @-@ 99 as well survivors from the British oil tanker Conch . 
 After refitting at Halifax from 3 March to 11 July 1941 , St. Laurent was assigned to the 14th Escort Group of the RCN 's Newfoundland Escort Force which covered convoys in the Mid @-@ Atlantic . Whilst escorting Convoy ON 33 in November in a gale , the ship was damaged severely enough by the weather that she was forced to return to Halifax for repairs . St. Laurent was transferred to the Mid @-@ Ocean Escort Force in December and remained until March 1943 . She was given a lengthy refit at Halifax in April – August 1942 . In early December 1942 , the ship 's director @-@ control tower and rangefinder were exchanged for a Type 271 target indication radar mounted above the bridge . By this time , she had been fitted with a high @-@ frequency direction finding system as well . Whilst assigned to Escort Group C1 defending Convoy ON 154 in late December 1942 , St. Laurent had her first victory on 27 December 1942 when she was credited with sinking U @-@ 356 while north of the Azores . 
 The ship was refitted in Dartmouth , Nova Scotia between 17 August and December 1943 . On 10 March 1944 , St. Laurent was credited with sinking U @-@ 845 in the North Atlantic , along with the destroyer HMS Forester , and frigates HMCS Owen Sound and HMCS Swansea . 
 The other changes made to the ship 's armament during the war ( exactly when these occurred is unknown ) included the replacement of ' B ' gun by a Hedgehog anti @-@ submarine spigot mortar , exchanging the two quadruple .50 @-@ calibre Vickers machine guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns , the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform and another pair were fitted on the wings of her bridge , and the removal of her 12 @-@ pounder AA gun . Type 286 short @-@ range surface search radar was also added . ' Y ' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to at least 60 depth charges . 
 In May 1944 she was transferred to the 11th Escort Group to support the Allied landings in Normandy . On D @-@ Day itself – 6 June 1944 – she was deployed with the Canadian destroyers Chaudière , Gatineau , Kootenay and Ottawa stationed in the entrance to the English Channel to prevent U @-@ boat attacks on the invasion convoys . Later she was deployed with her group in the Bay of Biscay for anti @-@ submarine operations . On 8 August she was unsuccessfully attacked by a glide bomb , and on the 13th she and Ottawa rescued survivors from U @-@ 270 which had been sunk with depth charges by a Sunderland aircraft . These duties continued into October , when she returned to Canada to refit . Conducted at Shelburne , Nova Scotia , the refit lasted from November 1944 to 20 March 1945 . St. Laurent returned to service in April 1945 , and was attached to the Halifax Escort Force for convoy defence off the east coast . After the German surrender on 6 May , she was employed as a troop transport , until paid off on 10 October 1945 . The ship was sold for scrap and broken up in 1947 .

 Entombed is an action @-@ adventure video game developed and published by Ultimate Play the Game for the Commodore 64 in 1985 . It is the second instalment of the Pendragon series and is a sequel to The Staff of Karnath . The game features series protagonist and aristocrat adventurer , Sir Arthur Pendragon , as he attempts to escape an ancient Egyptian tomb before all oxygen runs out . As with its predecessor , Entombed is presented in an isometric format . 
 The game was created and designed by brothers Dave and Bob Thomas , with Ultimate founders Tim and Chris Stamper otherwise being uninvolved in development . Entombed took considerably longer to develop due to the re @-@ programming of its game engine . It received positive reviews from critics upon release , with praise being directed at its playability and graphics . It was followed by a sequel , Blackwyche , which was released later in the year . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The game is presented in a isometric format and is set inside an ancient Egyptian tomb . Sir Arthur Pendragon 's main objective is to escape the tomb , the Great Sphinx , before all oxygen runs out . To achieve this end , the player must navigate a series of chambers linked by corridors , solve logic puzzles and deal with hostile enemies by either avoiding or fighting them . The tomb has seven floors . Pendragon 's only form of defence is his whip , which he can utilise to defend himself from enemies . The player also has access to a torch , which will allow them to see in certain pitch @-@ black areas of the tomb . 
 Unlike other games from the Pendragon series , Entombed features no collectable items required to finish the game . The player @-@ character has a life bar , which will deplete every time he makes contact with an enemy . To replenish life , the player must kill crows which will spawn in rooms at various times , and upon its death the crow will drop an Ankh symbol , the ancient Egyptian " Symbol of Life " . If the player completely runs out of life or if all the oxygen runs out from the tomb , then the game will end .

 Ashby Computers and Graphics was founded by brothers Tim and Chris Stamper , along with Tim 's wife , Carol , from their headquarters in Ashby @-@ de @-@ la @-@ Zouch in 1982 . Under the trading name of Ultimate Play the Game , they began producing multiple video games for the ZX Spectrum throughout the early 1980s . The company was known for their reluctance to reveal details about their operations and upcoming projects . Little was known about their development process except that they used to work in " separate teams " : one team would work on graphics while the other would concentrate on other aspects such as sound or programming . 
 The Pendragon series and The Staff of Karnath were materialised by brothers Dave and Robert " Bob " Thomas , rather than Ultimate founders Tim and Chris Stamper . Dave Thomas began his career in 1983 when he began producing games for the Atari 400 , including moderate @-@ sellers such as Warlok , which won him GB £ 5 @,@ 000 in a competition from Calisto Software . Although he later began working for the company in producing video games , he quit due to the strain of his daily 68 miles ( 109 km ) commute . Shortly after quitting Calisto Software , Dave Thomas started work on The Staff of Karnath . Bob Thomas was a trained technical illustrator for the Ministry of Defence and had experience with designing interiors for the Royal Navy , which later aided to the military @-@ themed visuals of the Pendragon series . As with all games in the Pendragon series , Entombed was programmed by Dave Thomas , whereas the graphics were designed by Bob Thomas . Dave Thomas admitted in a March 2008 interview that the name of the series protagonist , " Sir Arthur Pendragon " , was copied from the character of the Black Prince Pendragon from the Jack the Giant Killer stories . According to Dave Thomas , Entombed had the longest development cycle due to the expansion of the previous engine .

 The game received positive reviews upon release . John Cook of Popular Computing Weekly praised the graphics , heralding them as " colourful " and the detail of the stages as " beautiful " . Julian Rignall of Zzap ! 64 similarly praised the presentation of the game , expressing surprise on the size and graphical advancements from its predecessor . A reviewer of Computer and Video Games praised the graphics as " excellent " , whilst noting the resemblance to Indiana Jones . A reviewer of Computer Gamer similarly cited the graphics as " excellent " , stating that it was " what he expected from an Ultimate game " . However , they criticised the overall gameplay , stating it to be " very boring " and " slowly <unk> " . 
 Cook praised the game 's puzzle sections , comparing them more favourably than those of its predecessor , and summarised that the game was " definitely a must for any adventurer 's collection " . Rignall stated that the puzzles were " specular " and similarly praised them more favourably than those in The Staff of Karnath . However , Rignall criticised the sprites of the game , asserting that they were " large and crude " . 
 = HMS Iron Duke ( 1870 ) = 
 HMS Iron Duke was the last of four Audacious @-@ class central battery ironclads built for the Royal Navy in the late 1860s . Completed in 1871 , the ship was briefly assigned to the Reserve Fleet as a guardship in Ireland , before she was sent out to the China Station as its flagship . Iron Duke returned four years later and resumed her duties as a guardship . She accidentally rammed and sank her sister ship , Vanguard , in a heavy fog in mid @-@ 1875 and returned to the Far East in 1878 . The ship ran aground twice during this deployment and returned home in 1883 . After a lengthy refit , Iron Duke was assigned to the Channel Fleet in 1885 and remained there until she again became a guardship in 1890 . The ship was converted into a coal hulk a decade later and continued in that role until 1906 when she was sold for scrap and broken up . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Audacious class was designed as a second @-@ class ironclad intended for overseas service . They were 280 feet ( 85 @.@ 3 m ) long between perpendiculars and had a beam of 54 feet ( 16 @.@ 5 m ) . Iron Duke had a draught of 21 feet 7 inches ( 6 @.@ 6 m ) forward and 22 feet 7 inches ( 6 @.@ 9 m ) aft . The Audacious @-@ class ships displaced 6 @,@ 034 long tons ( 6 @,@ 131 t ) and had a tonnage of 3 @,@ 774 tons burthen . They had a complement of 450 officers and ratings . 
 Iron Duke had a pair of two @-@ cylinder , horizontal @-@ return , connecting @-@ rod steam engines , each driving a single 16 @-@ foot @-@ 6 @-@ inch ( 5 @.@ 03 m ) propeller , using steam provided by six rectangular boilers . The engines were designed to give the ships a speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) ; Iron Duke , however , reached a speed of 13 @.@ 64 knots ( 25 @.@ 26 km / h ; 15 @.@ 70 mph ) from 4 @,@ 268 indicated horsepower ( 3 @,@ 183 kW ) during her sea trials on 2 November 1870 . She carried a maximum of 450 long tons ( 460 t ) of coal . 
 The Audacious class was ship @-@ rigged with three masts and had a sail area of 25 @,@ 054 square feet ( 2 @,@ 327 @.@ 6 m2 ) . Around 1871 they were re @-@ rigged as barques with their sail area reduced to 23 @,@ 700 square feet ( 2 @,@ 200 m2 ) To reduce drag , the funnel was telescopic and could be lowered . Under sail alone , they could reach 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The main armament of the Audacious @-@ class ships consisted of 10 RML 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) rifled muzzle @-@ loading guns . Six of these were positioned on the main deck , three on each broadside , and the other four guns were mounted on the corners of the upper deck battery . The battery protruded over the sides of the ships to give the guns a certain amount of end @-@ on fire . The shell of the nine @-@ inch gun weighed 254 pounds ( 115 @.@ 2 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 12 long tons ( 12 t ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 420 ft / s ( 430 m / s ) and was rated with the ability to penetrate 11 @.@ 3 inches ( 287 mm ) of wrought @-@ iron armour at the muzzle . 
 The ships were equipped with four RML 6 in ( 152 mm ) 71 cwt guns as chase guns , two in the bow and another pair in the stern . They fired a 64 @-@ pound ( 29 @.@ 0 kg ) , 6 @.@ 3 @-@ inch ( 160 mm ) shell . They also had six RBL 20 pdr ( 3 @.@ 75 @-@ inch ( 95 mm ) ) rifled breech @-@ loading guns that were used as saluting guns . In 1878 , the ships received four 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) torpedo launchers on the main deck and the 6 @-@ inch guns were replaced by four breech @-@ loading BL 5 @-@ inch guns during the mid @-@ 1880s . 
 The wrought iron waterline armour belt of the Audacious class covered the entire length of the ships . It was eight inches ( 203 mm ) thick amidships , backed by eight – ten inches ( 203 – 254 mm ) of teak , and thinned to six inches towards the ends of the ships . It had a total height of 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) of which 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) was below water and 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) above at deep load . The main deck citadel 's ends were protected by a 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) forward bulkhead and a 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) one aft . The sides and embrasures of the upper battery were six inches thick , but its ends were unprotected . The ships also had a one @-@ man conning tower with walls 3 inches ( 76 mm ) thick . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Iron Duke , named after the nickname for Arthur Wellesley , 1st Duke of Wellington , was the first ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy . The ship was laid down at Pembroke Dockyard on 23 August 1868 , launched on 1 March 1870 and was completed on 1 January 1871 , at a cost of £ 208 @,@ 763 . She was initially assigned as a First Reserve <unk> at Plymouth , but was assigned as the flagship of the China Station in September . En route to the Far East , she became the first ironclad to use the Suez canal ; virtually all of her coal had to be unloaded to reduce her draught and she was towed by three tugboats through the canal in three days . Relieved by her sister ship , Audacious , Iron Duke returned to the UK in 1875 . To save money on the return ship , no tugboats were hired and the ship ran aground four times and frequently scraped the sides of the canal during her four @-@ day transit . Upon her arrival , she was paid off in May . 
 Iron Duke recommissioned two months later and was assigned as the guardship at Hull . During the First Reserve Squadron 's summer cruise on 1 September , she was en route with three other ironclads between Dublin and Queenstown ( now Cobh ) . In a thick fog , the ship accidentally rammed her sister , Vanguard , off Kish Bank , in Dublin Bay . Iron Duke had her bowsprit wrecked , but was otherwise little damaged . Her ram , however , had torn a 9 @-@ by @-@ 3 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 74 by 0 @.@ 91 m ) hole in Vanguard 's side . The ram also damaged the watertight bulkhead between Vanguard 's engine and boiler rooms which flooded both compartments and prevented her crew from using her steam @-@ powered pumps . The ship sunk in a little over an hour after all of the crew abandoned ship . 
 Following the loss , Iron Duke replaced Vanguard as the guardship at Kingstown ( now Dún Laoghaire ) , where she received the latter 's crew and remained until July 1877 when the ship began a lengthy refit that lasted until August 1878 . She was inspected by Admiral Thomas Symonds , Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , Plymouth , on 22 July . Iron Duke then departed Plymouth on 4 August , bound for the China Station ; en route , she pulled the P & O steamship SS Bengal off a reef in the Red Sea on 7 September after two days ' effort . Vice @-@ Admiral Robert Coote hoisted his flag aboard Iron Duke on 9 November . The ship ran aground herself on a sandbar entering the Huangpu River in May 1880 , after five days , she was pulled free by the American paddlewheel river gunboat Monocacy with little damage . Princes Arisugawa <unk> and Arisugawa Takehito visited Iron Duke on 22 July while she was visiting Yokohama , Japan . Several weeks later , Arisugawa Takehito came aboard to serve as a midshipman . The ship struck a rock off the coast of Hokkaido en route to <unk> Bay , Sakhalin Island , on 30 July 1880 . She floated off on 1 August after another ship had also grounded while trying to assist ; her repairs required a month in drydock in Hong Kong . On 28 January 1881 , Coote hauled down his flag and was relieved by Vice @-@ Admiral George Willes , the new Commander @-@ in @-@ chief , of the China Station . On 10 October , the ship was drydocked in Nagasaki , Japan and then sailed to Wusong District , Shanghai , China on 26 October . Iron Duke returned home in January 1883 and began a lengthy refit that included the replacement of her boilers . 
 On 16 April 1885 , the ship became a member of Admiral Geoffrey Hornby 's Particular Service Squadron until August , when she joined the Channel Squadron . After the ironclad Sultan broke loose from her anchors in Lisbon on 24 December 1886 during a gale and accidentally rammed and sank the French steamship SS Ville de Victoria , Iron Duke 's crew manned one boat in search for survivors , although it is uncertain how many they saved . The following year , Iron Duke participated in Queen Victoria 's Golden Jubilee Fleet review on 1 July 1887 at Spithead . She was reduced to reserve in 1890 and was converted to a coal hulk in 1900 , serving at Kyles of Bute . The ship was transferred from Fleet Reserve to Dockyard Reserve at Portsmouth in April 1902 , and eventually sold for scrap on 15 May 1906 to Galbraith of Glasgow . 
 = William McKinley = 
 William McKinley ( January 29 , 1843 – September 14 , 1901 ) was the 25th President of the United States , serving from March 4 , 1897 , until his assassination in September 1901 , six months into his second term . McKinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish – American War , raised protective tariffs to promote American industry , and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of inflationary proposals . 
 McKinley was the last president to have served in the American Civil War , beginning as a private in the Union Army and ending as a brevet major . After the war , he settled in Canton , Ohio , where he practiced law and married Ida Saxton . In 1876 , he was elected to Congress , where he became the Republican Party 's expert on the protective tariff , which he promised would bring prosperity . His 1890 McKinley Tariff was highly controversial ; which together with a Democratic redistricting aimed at gerrymandering him out of office , led to his defeat in the Democratic landslide of 1890 . He was elected Ohio 's governor in 1891 and 1893 , steering a moderate course between capital and labor interests . With the aid of his close adviser Mark Hanna , he secured the Republican nomination for president in 1896 , amid a deep economic depression . He defeated his Democratic rival , William Jennings Bryan , after a front @-@ porch campaign in which he advocated " sound money " ( the gold standard unless altered by international agreement ) and promised that high tariffs would restore prosperity . 
 Rapid economic growth marked McKinley 's presidency . He promoted the 1897 Dingley Tariff to protect manufacturers and factory workers from foreign competition , and in 1900 , he secured the passage of the Gold Standard Act . McKinley hoped to persuade Spain to grant independence to rebellious Cuba without conflict , but when negotiation failed , he led the nation in the Spanish – American War of 1898 ; the U.S. victory was quick and decisive . As part of the peace settlement , Spain turned over to the United States its main overseas colonies of Puerto Rico , Guam , and the Philippines ; Cuba was promised independence , but at that time remained under the control of the U.S. Army . The United States annexed the independent Republic of Hawaii in 1898 and it became a U.S. territory . 
 Historians regard McKinley 's 1896 victory as a realigning election , in which the political stalemate of the post @-@ Civil War era gave way to the Republican @-@ dominated Fourth Party System , which began with the Progressive Era . McKinley defeated Bryan again in the 1900 presidential election , in a campaign focused on imperialism , protectionism , and free silver . However , his legacy was quickly cut short when he was shot on September 6 , 1901 by Leon Czolgosz , a second @-@ generation Polish @-@ American with anarchist leanings ; McKinley died eight days later , and was succeeded by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt . As an innovator of American interventionism and pro @-@ business sentiment , McKinley 's presidency is generally considered above average , though his universally positive public perception was soon overshadowed by Roosevelt . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 William McKinley , Jr. was born in 1843 in Niles , Ohio , the seventh child of William and Nancy ( née Allison ) McKinley . The McKinleys were of English and Scots @-@ Irish descent and had settled in western Pennsylvania in the 18th century . There , the elder McKinley was born in Pine Township , Mercer County . 
 The family moved to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy , settling in New Lisbon ( now Lisbon ) . He met Nancy Allison there , and married her later . The Allison family was of mostly English descent and among Pennsylvania 's earliest settlers . The family trade on both sides was iron @-@ making , and McKinley senior operated foundries throughout Ohio , in New Lisbon , Niles , Poland , and finally Canton . The McKinley household was , like many from Ohio 's Western Reserve , steeped in Whiggish and abolitionist sentiment , the latter based on the family 's staunch Methodist beliefs . William followed in the Methodist tradition , becoming active in the local Methodist church at the age of sixteen . 
 He was a lifelong pious Methodist . In 1852 , the family moved from Niles to Poland , Ohio so that their children could attend the better school there . Graduating in 1859 , he enrolled the following year at Allegheny College in Meadville , Pennsylvania . He remained at Allegheny for only one year , returning home in 1860 after becoming ill and depressed . He also spent time at Mount Union College in Alliance , Ohio , where he joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon . He did not graduate from either university . Although his health recovered , family finances declined and McKinley was unable to return to Allegheny , first working as a postal clerk and later taking a job teaching at a school near Poland , Ohio .

 When the Southern states seceded from the Union and the American Civil War began , thousands of men in Ohio volunteered for service . Among them were McKinley and his cousin William McKinley Osbourne , who enlisted as privates in the newly formed Poland Guards in June 1861 . The men left for Columbus where they were consolidated with other small units to form the 23rd Ohio Infantry . The men were unhappy to learn that , unlike Ohio 's earlier volunteer regiments , they would not be permitted to elect their officers ; they would be designated by Ohio 's governor , William Dennison . Dennison appointed Colonel William Rosecrans as the commander of the regiment , and the men began training on the outskirts of Columbus . McKinley quickly took to the soldier 's life and wrote a series of letters to his hometown newspaper extolling the army and the Union cause . Delays in issuance of uniforms and weapons again brought the men into conflict with their officers , but Major Rutherford B. Hayes convinced them to accept what the government had issued them ; his style in dealing with the men impressed McKinley , beginning an association and friendship that would last until Hayes ' death in 1893 . 
 After a month of training , McKinley and the 23rd Ohio , now led by Colonel Eliakim P. Scammon , set out for western Virginia ( today part of West Virginia ) in July 1861 as a part of the Kanawha Division . McKinley initially thought Scammon was a martinet , but when the regiment finally saw battle , he came to appreciate the value of their relentless drilling . Their first contact with the enemy came in September when they drove back Confederate troops at Carnifex Ferry in present @-@ day West Virginia . Three days after the battle , McKinley was assigned to duty in the brigade quartermaster office , where he worked both to supply his regiment , and as a clerk . In November , the regiment established winter quarters near Fayetteville ( today in West Virginia ) . McKinley spent the winter substituting for a commissary sergeant who was ill , and in April 1862 he was promoted to that rank . The regiment resumed its advance that spring with Hayes in command ( Scammon by then led the brigade ) and fought several minor engagements against the rebel forces . 
 That September , McKinley 's regiment was called east to reinforce General John Pope 's Army of Virginia at the Second Battle of Bull Run . Delayed in passing through Washington , D.C. , the 23rd Ohio did not arrive in time for the battle , but joined the Army of the Potomac as it hurried north to cut off Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia as it advanced into Maryland . The 23rd was the first regiment to encounter the Confederates at the Battle of South Mountain on September 14 . After severe losses , Union forces drove back the Confederates and continued to Sharpsburg , Maryland , where they engaged Lee 's army at the Battle of Antietam , one of the bloodiest battles of the war . The 23rd was also in the thick of the fighting at Antietam , and McKinley himself came under heavy fire when bringing rations to the men on the line . McKinley 's regiment again suffered many casualties , but the Army of the Potomac was victorious and the Confederates retreated into Virginia . The regiment was then detached from the Army of the Potomac and returned by train to western Virginia . 
 = = = Shenandoah Valley and promotion = = = 
 While the regiment went into winter quarters near Charleston , Virginia ( present @-@ day West Virginia ) , McKinley was ordered back to Ohio with some other sergeants to recruit fresh troops . When they arrived in Columbus , Governor David Tod surprised McKinley with a commission as second lieutenant in recognition of his service at Antietam . McKinley and his comrades saw little action until July 1863 , when the division skirmished with John Hunt Morgan 's cavalry at the Battle of Buffington Island . Early in 1864 , the Army command structure in West Virginia was reorganized , and the division was assigned to George Crook 's Army of West Virginia . They soon resumed the offensive , marching into southwestern Virginia to destroy salt and lead mines used by the enemy . On May 9 , the army engaged Confederate troops at Cloyd 's Mountain , where the men charged the enemy entrenchments and drove the rebels from the field . McKinley later said the combat there was " as desperate as any witnessed during the war . " Following the rout , the Union forces destroyed Confederate supplies and skirmished with the enemy again successfully . 
 McKinley and his regiment moved to the Shenandoah Valley as the armies broke from winter quarters to resume hostilities . Crook 's corps was attached to Major General David Hunter 's Army of the Shenandoah and soon back in contact with Confederate forces , capturing Lexington , Virginia , on June 11 . They continued south toward Lynchburg , tearing up railroad track as they advanced . Hunter believed the troops at Lynchburg were too powerful , however , and the brigade returned to West Virginia . Before the army could make another attempt , Confederate General Jubal Early 's raid into Maryland forced their recall to the north . Early 's army surprised them at Kernstown on July 24 , where McKinley came under heavy fire and the army was defeated . Retreating into Maryland , the army was reorganized again : Major General Philip Sheridan replaced Hunter , and McKinley , who had been promoted to captain after the battle , was transferred to General Crook 's staff . By August , Early was retreating south in the valley , with Sheridan 's army in pursuit . They fended off a Confederate assault at <unk> , where McKinley had a horse shot out from under him , and advanced to Opequon Creek , where they broke the enemy lines and pursued them farther south . They followed up the victory with another at Fisher 's Hill on September 22 , and were engaged once more at Cedar Creek on October 19 . After initially falling back from the Confederate advance , McKinley helped to rally the troops and turn the tide of the battle . 
 After Cedar Creek , the army stayed in the vicinity through election day , when McKinley cast his first presidential ballot , for the incumbent Republican , Abraham Lincoln . The next day , they moved north up the valley into winter quarters near Kernstown . In February 1865 , Crook was captured by Confederate raiders . Crook 's capture added to the confusion as the army was reorganized for the spring campaign , and McKinley found himself serving on the staffs of four different generals over the next fifteen days — Crook , John D. Stevenson , Samuel S. Carroll , and Winfield S. Hancock . Finally assigned to Carroll 's staff again , McKinley acted as the general 's first and only adjutant . Lee and his army surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant a few days later , effectively ending the war . McKinley found time to join a Freemason lodge ( later renamed after him ) in Winchester , Virginia , before he and Carroll were transferred to Hancock 's First Veterans Corps in Washington . Just before the war 's end , McKinley received his final promotion , a brevet commission as major . In July , the Veterans Corps was mustered out of service , and McKinley and Carroll were relieved of their duties . Carroll and Hancock encouraged McKinley to apply for a place in the peacetime army , but he declined and returned to Ohio the following month . 
 = = Legal career and marriage = = 
 After the war ended in 1865 , McKinley decided on a career in the law and began studying in the office of an attorney in Poland , Ohio . The following year , he continued his studies by attending Albany Law School in New York . After studying there for less than a year , McKinley returned home and was admitted to the bar in Warren , Ohio , in March 1867 . That same year , he moved to Canton , the county seat of Stark County , and set up a small office . He soon formed a partnership with George W. Belden , an experienced lawyer and former judge . His practice was successful enough for him to buy a block of buildings on Main Street in Canton , which provided him with a small but consistent rental income for decades to come . When his Army friend Rutherford B. Hayes was nominated for governor in 1867 , McKinley made speeches on his behalf in Stark County , his first foray into politics . The county was closely divided between Democrats and Republicans , but Hayes carried it that year in his statewide victory . In 1869 , McKinley ran for the office of prosecuting attorney of Stark County , an office usually then held by Democrats , and was unexpectedly elected . When McKinley ran for re @-@ election in 1871 , the Democrats nominated William A. Lynch , a prominent local lawyer , and McKinley was defeated by 143 votes . 
 As McKinley 's professional career progressed , so too did his social life blossom as he wooed Ida Saxton , the daughter of a prominent Canton family . They were married on January 25 , 1871 , in the newly built First Presbyterian Church of Canton , although Ida soon joined her husband 's Methodist church . Their first child , Katherine , was born on Christmas Day 1871 . A second daughter , Ida , followed in 1873 , but died the same year . McKinley 's wife descended into a deep depression at her baby 's death and her health , never robust , grew worse . Two years later , in 1875 , Katherine died of typhoid fever . Ida never recovered from her daughters ' deaths ; the McKinleys had no more children . Ida McKinley developed epilepsy around the same time and thereafter disliked her husband 's leaving her side . He remained a devoted husband and tended to his wife 's medical and emotional needs for the rest of his life . 
 Ida insisted that McKinley continue his increasingly successful career in law and politics . He attended the state Republican convention that nominated Hayes for a third term as governor in 1875 , and campaigned again for his old friend in the election that fall . The next year , McKinley undertook a high @-@ profile case defending a group of coal miners arrested for rioting after a clash with strikebreakers . Lynch , McKinley 's opponent in the 1871 election , and his partner , William R. Day , were the opposing counsel , and the mine owners included Mark Hanna , a Cleveland businessman . Taking the case pro bono , he was successful in getting all but one of the miners acquitted . The case raised McKinley 's standing among laborers , a crucial part of the Stark County electorate , and also introduced him to Hanna , who would become his strongest backer in years to come . 
 McKinley 's good standing with labor became useful that year as he campaigned for the Republican nomination for Ohio 's 17th congressional district . Delegates to the county conventions thought he could attract blue @-@ collar voters , and in August 1876 , McKinley was nominated . By that time , Hayes had been nominated for president , and McKinley campaigned for him while running his own congressional campaign . Both were successful . McKinley , campaigning mostly on his support for a protective tariff , defeated the Democratic nominee , Levi L. Lamborn , by 3 @,@ 300 votes , while Hayes won a hotly disputed election to reach the presidency . McKinley 's victory came at a personal cost : his income as a congressman would be half of what he earned as a lawyer .

' And that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards . " 
 McKinley first took his congressional seat in October 1877 , when President Hayes summoned Congress into special session . With the Republicans in the minority , McKinley was given unimportant committee assignments , which he undertook conscientiously . McKinley 's friendship with Hayes did McKinley little good on Capitol Hill ; the President was not well @-@ regarded by many leaders there . The young congressman broke with Hayes on the question of the currency , but it did not affect their friendship . The United States had effectively been placed on the gold standard by the Coinage Act of 1873 ; when silver prices dropped significantly , many sought to make silver again a legal tender , equally with gold . Such a course would be inflationary , but advocates argued that the economic benefits of the increased money supply would be worth the inflation ; opponents warned that " free silver " would not bring the promised benefits and would harm the United States in international trade . McKinley voted for the Bland @-@ Allison Act of 1878 , which mandated large government purchases of silver for striking into money , and also joined the large majorities in each house that overrode Hayes ' veto of the legislation . In so doing , McKinley voted against the position of the House Republican leader , his fellow Ohioan and friend , James Garfield . 
 From his first term in Congress , McKinley was a strong advocate of protective tariffs . The primary purposes of such imposts was not to raise revenue , but to allow American manufacturing to develop by giving it a price advantage in the domestic market over foreign competitors . McKinley biographer Margaret Leech noted that Canton had become prosperous as a center for the manufacture of farm equipment because of protection , and that this may have helped form his political views . McKinley introduced and supported bills that raised protective tariffs , and opposed those that lowered them or imposed tariffs simply to raise revenue . Garfield 's election as president in 1880 created a vacancy on the House Ways and Means Committee ; McKinley was selected to fill it , placing him on the most powerful committee after only two terms . 
 McKinley increasingly became a significant figure in national politics . In 1880 , he served a brief term as Ohio 's representative on the Republican National Committee . In 1884 , he was elected a delegate to that year 's Republican convention , where he served as chair of the Committee on Resolutions and won plaudits for his handling of the convention when called upon to preside . By 1886 , McKinley , Senator John Sherman , and Governor Joseph B. Foraker were considered the leaders of the Republican party in Ohio . Sherman , who had helped to found the Republican Party , ran three times for the Republican nomination for president in the 1880s , each time failing , while Foraker began a meteoric rise in Ohio politics early in the decade . Hanna , once he entered public affairs as a political manager and generous contributor , supported Sherman 's ambitions , as well as those of Foraker . The latter relationship broke off at the 1888 Republican National Convention , where McKinley , Foraker , and Hanna were all delegates supporting Sherman . Convinced Sherman could not win , Foraker threw his support to the unsuccessful Republican 1884 presidential nominee , Maine Senator James G. Blaine . When Blaine stated he was not a candidate , Foraker returned to Sherman , but the nomination went to former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison , who was elected president . In the bitterness that followed the convention , Hanna abandoned Foraker , and for the rest of McKinley 's life , the Ohio Republican Party was divided into two factions , one aligned with McKinley , Sherman , and Hanna and the other with Foraker . Hanna came to admire McKinley and became a friend and close adviser to him . Although Hanna remained active in business and in promoting other Republicans , in the years after 1888 , he spent an increasing amount of time boosting McKinley 's political career . 
 In 1889 , with the Republicans in the majority , McKinley sought election as Speaker of the House . He failed to gain the post , which went to Thomas B. Reed of Maine ; however , Speaker Reed appointed McKinley chairman of the Ways and Means Committee . The Ohioan guided the McKinley Tariff of 1890 through Congress ; although McKinley 's work was altered through the influence of special interests in the Senate , it imposed a number of protective tariffs on foreign goods .

 Recognizing McKinley 's potential , the Democrats , whenever they controlled the Ohio legislature , sought to gerrymander or <unk> him out of office . In 1878 , McKinley faced election in a redrawn 17th district ; he won anyway , causing Hayes to <unk> , " Oh , the good luck of McKinley ! He was gerrymandered out and then beat the gerrymander ! We enjoyed it as much as he did . " After the 1882 election , McKinley was unseated on an election contest by a near party @-@ line House vote . Out of office , he was briefly depressed by the setback , but soon vowed to run again . The Democrats again redistricted Stark County for the 1884 election ; McKinley was returned to Congress anyway . 
 For 1890 , the Democrats gerrymandered McKinley one final time , placing Stark County in the same district as one of the strongest pro @-@ Democrat counties , Holmes , populated by solidly Democratic Pennsylvania Dutch . The new boundaries seemed good , based on past results , for a Democratic majority of 2000 to 3000 . The Republicans could not reverse the gerrymander as legislative elections would not be held until 1891 , but they could throw all their energies into the district , as the McKinley Tariff was a main theme of the Democratic campaign nationwide , and there was considerable attention paid to McKinley 's race . The Republican Party sent its leading orators to Canton , including Blaine ( then Secretary of State ) , Speaker Reed and President Harrison . The Democrats countered with their best spokesmen on tariff issues . McKinley tirelessly stumped his new district , reaching out to its 40 @,@ 000 voters to explain that his tariff 
 was framed for the people ... as a defense to their industries , as a protection to the labor of their hands , as a safeguard to the happy homes of American workingmen , and as a security to their education , their wages , and their investments ... It will bring to this country a prosperity unparalleled in our own history and unrivalled in the history of the world . " 
 Democrats ran a strong candidate in former lieutenant governor John G. Warwick . To drive their point home , they hired young partisans to pretend to be peddlers , who went door to door offering 25 @-@ cent <unk> to housewives for 50 cents , explaining the rise in prices was due to the McKinley Tariff . In the end , McKinley lost by 300 votes , but the Republicans won a statewide majority and claimed a moral victory . 
 = = = Governor of Ohio = = = 
 Even before McKinley completed his term in Congress , he met with a delegation of Ohioans urging him to run for governor . Governor James E. Campbell , a Democrat , who had defeated Foraker in 1889 , was to seek re @-@ election in 1891 . The Ohio Republican party remained divided , but McKinley quietly arranged for Foraker to nominate him at the 1891 state Republican convention , which chose McKinley by acclamation . The former congressman spent much of the second half of 1891 campaigning against Campbell , beginning in his birthplace of Niles . Hanna , however , was little seen in the campaign ; he spent much of his time raising funds for the election of legislators pledged to vote for Sherman in the 1892 senatorial election . McKinley won the 1891 election by some 20 @,@ 000 votes ; the following January , Sherman , with considerable assistance from Hanna , turned back a challenge by Foraker to win the legislature 's vote for another term in the Senate . 
 Ohio 's governor had relatively little power — for example , he could recommend legislation , but not veto it — but with Ohio a key swing state , its governor was a major figure in national politics . Although McKinley believed that the health of the nation depended on that of business , he was evenhanded in dealing with labor . He procured legislation that set up an arbitration board to settle work disputes and obtained passage of a law that fined employers who fired workers for belonging to a union . 
 President Harrison had proven unpopular ; there were divisions even within the Republican party as the year 1892 began and Harrison began his re @-@ election drive . Although no declared candidate opposed Harrison , many Republicans were ready to dump the President from the ticket if an alternative emerged . Among the possible candidates spoken of were McKinley , Reed , and the aging Blaine . Fearing that the Ohio governor would emerge as a candidate , Harrison 's managers arranged for McKinley to be permanent chairman of the convention in Minneapolis , requiring him to play a public , neutral role . Hanna established an unofficial McKinley headquarters near the convention hall , though no active effort was made to convert delegates to McKinley 's cause . McKinley objected to delegate votes being cast for him ; nevertheless he finished third , behind the renominated Harrison , and behind Blaine , who had sent word he did not want to be considered . Although McKinley campaigned loyally for the Republican ticket , Harrison was defeated by former President Cleveland in the November election . In the wake of Cleveland 's victory , McKinley was seen by some as the likely Republican candidate in 1896 . 
 Soon after Cleveland 's return to office , hard times struck the nation with the Panic of 1893 . A businessman in Youngstown , Robert Walker , had lent money to McKinley in their younger days ; in gratitude , McKinley had often guaranteed Walker 's borrowings for his business . The governor had never kept track of what he was signing ; he believed Walker a sound businessman . In fact , Walker had deceived McKinley , telling him that new notes were actually renewals of matured ones . Walker was ruined by the recession ; McKinley was called upon for repayment in February 1893 . The total owed was over $ 100 @,@ 000 and a despairing McKinley initially proposed to resign as governor and earn the money as an attorney . Instead , McKinley 's wealthy supporters , including Hanna and Chicago publisher H. H. Kohlsaat , became trustees of a fund from which the notes would be paid . Both William and Ida McKinley placed their property in the hands of the fund 's trustees ( who included Hanna and Kohlsaat ) , and the supporters raised and contributed a substantial sum of money . All of the couple 's property was returned to them by the end of 1893 , and when McKinley , who had promised eventual repayment , asked for the list of contributors , it was refused him . Many people who had suffered in the hard times sympathized with McKinley , whose popularity grew . He was easily re @-@ elected in November 1893 , receiving the largest percentage of the vote of any Ohio governor since the Civil War . 
 McKinley campaigned widely for Republicans in the 1894 midterm congressional elections ; many party candidates in districts where he spoke were successful . His political efforts in Ohio were rewarded with the election in November 1895 of a Republican successor as governor , Asa Bushnell , and a Republican legislature that elected Foraker to the Senate . McKinley supported Foraker for Senate and Bushnell ( who was of Foraker 's faction ) for governor ; in return , the new senator @-@ elect agreed to back McKinley 's presidential ambitions . With party peace in Ohio assured , McKinley turned to the national arena .

 = = = Obtaining the nomination = = = 
 It is unclear when William McKinley began to seriously prepare a run for president . As Phillips notes , " no documents , no diaries , no confidential letters to Mark Hanna ( or anyone else ) contain his secret hopes or veiled stratagems . " From the beginning , McKinley 's preparations had the participation of Hanna , whose biographer William T. Horner noted , " what is certainly true is that in 1888 the two men began to develop a close working relationship that helped put McKinley in the White House . " Sherman did not run for president again after 1888 , and so Hanna could support McKinley 's ambitions for that office wholeheartedly . 
 Backed by Hanna 's money and organizational skills , McKinley quietly built support for a presidential bid through 1895 and early 1896 . When other contenders such as Speaker Reed and Iowa Senator William B. Allison sent agents outside their states to organize Republicans in support of their candidacies , they found that Hanna 's agents had preceded them . According to historian Stanley Jones in his study of the 1896 election , 
 Another feature common to the Reed and Allison campaigns was their failure to make headway against the tide which was running toward McKinley . In fact , both campaigns from the moment they were launched were in retreat . The calm confidence with which each candidate claimed the support of his own section [ of the country ] soon gave way to ... bitter accusations that Hanna by winning support for McKinley in their sections had violated the rules of the game . 
 Hanna , on McKinley 's behalf , met with the eastern Republican political bosses , such as Senators Thomas Platt of New York and Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania , who were willing to guarantee McKinley 's nomination in exchange for promises regarding patronage and offices . McKinley , however , was determined to obtain the nomination without making deals , and Hanna accepted that decision . Many of their early efforts were focused on the South ; Hanna obtained a vacation home in southern Georgia where McKinley visited and met with Republican politicians from the region . McKinley needed 453 ½ delegate votes to gain the nomination ; he gained nearly half that number from the South and border states . Platt lamented in his memoirs , " [ Hanna ] had the South practically solid before some of us awakened . " 
 The bosses still hoped to deny McKinley a first @-@ ballot majority at the convention by boosting support for local favorite son candidates such as Quay , New York Governor ( and former vice president ) Levi P. Morton , and Illinois Senator Shelby Cullom . Delegate @-@ rich Illinois proved a crucial battleground , as McKinley supporters , such as Chicago businessman ( and future vice president ) Charles G. Dawes , sought to elect delegates pledged to vote for McKinley at the national convention in St. Louis . Cullom proved unable to stand against McKinley despite the support of local Republican machines ; at the state convention at the end of April , McKinley completed a near @-@ sweep of Illinois ' delegates . Former president Harrison had been deemed a possible contender if he entered the race ; when Harrison made it known he would not seek a third nomination , the McKinley organization took control of Indiana with a speed Harrison privately found unseemly . Morton operatives who journeyed to Indiana sent word back that they had found the state alive for McKinley . Wyoming Senator Francis Warren wrote , " The politicians are making a hard fight against him , but if the masses could speak , McKinley is the choice of at least 75 % of the entire [ body of ] Republican voters in the Union " . 
 By the time the national convention began in St. Louis on June 16 , 1896 , McKinley had an ample majority of delegates . The former governor , who remained in Canton , followed events at the convention closely by telephone , and was able to hear part of Foraker 's speech nominating him over the line . When Ohio was reached in the roll call of states , its votes gave McKinley the nomination , which he celebrated by hugging his wife and mother as his friends fled the house , anticipating the first of many crowds that gathered at the Republican candidate 's home . Thousands of partisans came from Canton and surrounding towns that evening to hear McKinley speak from his front porch . The convention nominated Republican National Committee vice chairman Garret Hobart of New Jersey for vice president , a choice actually made , by most accounts , by Hanna . Hobart , a wealthy lawyer , businessman , and former state legislator , was not widely known , but as Hanna biographer Herbert Croly pointed out , " if he did little to strengthen the ticket he did nothing to weaken it " .

 Before the Republican convention , McKinley had been a " straddle bug " on the currency question , favoring moderate positions on silver such as accomplishing bimetallism by international agreement . In the final days before the convention , McKinley decided , after hearing from politicians and businessmen , that the platform should endorse the gold standard , though it should allow for bimetallism by international agreement . Adoption of the platform caused some western delegates , led by Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller , to walk out of the convention . However , compared with the Democrats , Republican divisions on the issue were small , especially as McKinley promised future concessions to silver advocates . 
 The bad economic times had continued , and strengthened the hand of forces for free silver . The issue bitterly divided the Democratic Party ; President Cleveland firmly supported the gold standard , but an increasing number of rural Democrats wanted silver , especially in the South and West . The silverites took control of the 1896 Democratic National Convention and chose William Jennings Bryan for president ; he had electrified the delegates with his Cross of Gold speech . Bryan 's financial radicalism shocked bankers — they thought his inflationary program would bankrupt the railroads and ruin the economy . Hanna approached them for support for his strategy to win the election , and they gave $ 3 @.@ 5 million for speakers and over 200 million pamphlets advocating the Republican position on the money and tariff questions . 
 Bryan 's campaign had at most an estimated $ 500 @,@ 000 . With his eloquence and youthful energy his major assets in the race , Bryan decided on a whistle @-@ stop political tour by train on an unprecedented scale . Hanna urged McKinley to match Bryan 's tour with one of his own ; the candidate declined on the grounds that the Democrat was a better stump speaker : " I might just as well set up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete with some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan . I have to think when I speak . " Instead of going to the people , McKinley would remain at home in Canton and allow the people to come to him ; according to historian R. Hal Williams in his book on the 1896 election , " it was , as it turned out , a brilliant strategy . McKinley 's ' Front Porch Campaign ' became a legend in American political history . " 
 McKinley made himself available to the public every day except Sunday , receiving delegations from the front porch of his home . The railroads subsidized the visitors with low excursion rates — the pro @-@ silver Cleveland Plain Dealer <unk> stated that going to Canton had been made " cheaper than staying at home " . Delegations marched through the streets from the railroad station to McKinley 's home on North Market Street . Once there , they crowded close to the front porch — from which they surreptitiously whittled souvenirs — as their spokesman addressed McKinley . The candidate then responded , speaking on campaign issues in a speech molded to suit the interest of the delegation . The speeches were carefully scripted to avoid extemporaneous remarks ; even the spokesman 's remarks were approved by McKinley or a representative . This was done as the candidate feared an offhand comment by another that might rebound on him . 
 Most Democratic newspapers refused to support Bryan , the major exception being the New York Journal , controlled by William Randolph Hearst , whose fortune was based on silver mines . In biased reporting and through the sharp cartoons of Homer Davenport , Hanna was viciously characterized as a <unk> , trampling on labor . McKinley was drawn as a child , easily controlled by big business . Even today , these depictions still color the images of Hanna and McKinley : one as a heartless businessman , the other as a creature of Hanna and others of his ilk . 
 The Democrats had pamphlets too , though not as many . Jones analyzed how voters responded to the education campaigns of the two parties : 
 For the people it was a campaign of study and analysis , of exhortation and conviction — a campaign of search for economic and political truth . Pamphlets tumbled from the presses , to be read , reread , studied , debated , to become guides to economic thought and political action . They were printed and distributed by the million ... but the people hankered for more . Favorite pamphlets became dog @-@ eared , grimy , fell apart as their owners laboriously restudied their arguments and quoted from them in public and private debate . 
 The battleground proved to be the Midwest — the South and most of the West were conceded to Bryan — and the Democrat spent much of his time in those crucial states . The Northeast was considered most likely safe for McKinley after the early @-@ voting states of Maine and Vermont supported him in September . By then , it was clear that public support for silver had receded , and McKinley began to emphasize the tariff issue . By the end of September , the Republicans had discontinued printing material on the silver issue , and were entirely concentrating on the tariff question . On November 3 , 1896 , the voters had their say in most of the nation . McKinley won the entire Northeast and Midwest ; he won 51 % of the vote and an ample majority in the Electoral College . Bryan had concentrated entirely on the silver issue , and had not appealed to urban workers . Voters in cities supported McKinley ; the only city outside the South of more than 100 @,@ 000 population carried by Bryan was Denver , Colorado . 
 The 1896 presidential election is often seen as a realigning election , in which McKinley 's view of a stronger central government building American industry through protective tariffs and a dollar based on gold triumphed . The voting patterns established then displaced the near @-@ deadlock the major parties had seen since the Civil War ; the Republican dominance begun then would continue until 1932 , another realigning election with the ascent of Franklin Roosevelt . Phillips argues that , with the possible exception of Iowa Senator Allison , McKinley was the only Republican who could have defeated Bryan — he theorized that eastern candidates such as Morton or Reed would have done badly against the Illinois @-@ born Bryan in the crucial Midwest . According to the biographer , though Bryan was popular among rural voters , " McKinley appealed to a very different industrialized , urbanized America . " 
 = = Presidency ( 1897 – 1901 ) = = 
 = = = Inauguration and appointments = = = 
 McKinley was sworn in as president on March 4 , 1897 , as his wife and mother looked on . The new President gave a lengthy inaugural address ; he urged tariff reform , and stated that the currency issue would have to await tariff legislation . He warned against foreign interventions , " We want no wars of conquest . We must avoid the temptation of territorial aggression . " 
 McKinley 's most controversial Cabinet appointment was that of John Sherman as Secretary of State . Sherman was not McKinley 's first choice for the position ; he initially offered it to Senator Allison . One consideration in Senator Sherman 's appointment was to provide a place in the Senate for Hanna ( who had turned down a Cabinet position as Postmaster General ) . As Sherman had served as Secretary of the Treasury under Hayes , only the State position , the leading Cabinet post , was likely to entice him from the Senate . Sherman 's mental faculties were decaying even in 1896 ; this was widely spoken of in political circles , but McKinley did not believe the rumors . Nevertheless , McKinley sent his cousin , William McKinley Osborne , to have dinner with the 73 @-@ year @-@ old senator ; he reported back that Sherman seemed as lucid as ever . McKinley wrote once the appointment was announced , " the stories regarding Senator Sherman 's ' mental decay ' are without foundation ... When I saw him last I was convinced both of his perfect health , physically and mentally , and that the prospects of life were remarkably good . " 
 After some difficulties , Ohio Governor Bushnell appointed Hanna to the Senate . Once in Cabinet office , Sherman 's mental incapacity became increasingly apparent . He was often bypassed by his first assistant , McKinley 's Canton crony Judge William Day , and by the second secretary , Alvey A. Adee . Day , an Ohio lawyer unfamiliar with diplomacy , was often reticent in meetings ; Adee was somewhat deaf . One diplomat characterized the arrangement , " the head of the department knew nothing , the first assistant said nothing , and the second assistant heard nothing " . 
 Maine Congressman Nelson Dingley Jr. was McKinley 's choice for Secretary of the Treasury ; he declined it , preferring to remain as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee . Charles Dawes , who had been Hanna 's lieutenant in Chicago during the campaign , was considered for the Treasury post but by some accounts Dawes considered himself too young . Dawes eventually became Comptroller of the Currency ; he recorded in his published diary that he had strongly urged McKinley to appoint as secretary the successful candidate , Lyman J. Gage , president of the First National Bank of Chicago and a Gold Democrat . The Navy Department was offered to former Massachusetts Congressman John Davis Long , an old friend from the House , on January 30 , 1897 . Although McKinley was initially inclined to allow Long to choose his own assistant , there was considerable pressure on the President @-@ elect to appoint Theodore Roosevelt , head of the New York City Police Commission and a former state assemblyman . McKinley was reluctant , stating to one Roosevelt booster , " I want peace and I am told that your friend Theodore is always getting into rows with everybody . " Nevertheless , he made the appointment . 
 In addition to Sherman , McKinley made one other ill @-@ advised Cabinet appointment , that of Secretary of War , which fell to Russell A. Alger , former general and Michigan governor . Competent enough in peacetime , Alger proved inadequate once the conflict with Spain began . With the War Department plagued by scandal , Alger resigned at McKinley 's request in mid @-@ 1899 . Vice President Hobart , as was customary at the time , was not invited to Cabinet meetings . However , he proved a valuable adviser both for McKinley and for his Cabinet members . The wealthy Vice President leased a residence close to the White House ; the two families visited each other without formality , and the Vice President 's wife , Jennie Tuttle Hobart , sometimes substituted as Executive Mansion hostess when Ida McKinley was unwell . For most of McKinley 's administration , George B. Cortelyou served as his personal secretary . Cortelyou , who served in three Cabinet positions under Theodore Roosevelt , became a combination press secretary and chief of staff to McKinley . 
 = = = War with Spain = = = 
 For decades , rebels in Cuba had waged an intermittent campaign for freedom from Spanish colonial rule . By 1895 , the conflict had expanded to a war for Cuban independence . As war engulfed the island , Spanish reprisals against the rebels grew ever harsher . These included the removal of Cubans to internment camps near Spanish military bases , a strategy designed to make it hard for the rebels to receive support in the countryside . American opinion favored the rebels , and McKinley shared in their outrage against Spanish policies . As many of his countrymen called for war to liberate Cuba , McKinley favored a peaceful approach , hoping that through negotiation , Spain might be convinced to grant Cuba independence , or at least to allow the Cubans some measure of autonomy . The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897 , but it became clear that Spain would never concede Cuban independence , while the rebels ( and their American supporters ) would never settle for anything less . 
 In January 1898 , Spain promised some concessions to the rebels , but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana , McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property . On February 15 , the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed . Public opinion and the newspapers demanded war , but McKinley insisted that a court of inquiry first determine whether the explosion was accidental . Negotiations with Spain continued as the court considered the evidence , but on March 20 , the court ruled that the Maine was blown up by an underwater mine . As pressure for war mounted in Congress , McKinley continued to negotiate for Cuban independence . Spain refused McKinley 's proposals , and on April 11 , McKinley turned the matter over to Congress . He did not ask for war , but Congress declared war anyway on April 20 , with the addition of the Teller Amendment , which disavowed any intention of annexing Cuba . 
 The expansion of the telegraph and the development of the telephone gave McKinley a greater control over the day @-@ to @-@ day management of the war than previous presidents had enjoyed , and he used the new technologies to direct the army 's and navy 's movements as far as he was able . McKinley found Alger inadequate as Secretary of War , and did not get along with the Army 's commanding general , Nelson A. Miles . Bypassing them , he looked for strategic advice first from Miles 's predecessor , General John Schofield , and later from Adjutant General Henry Clarke Corbin . The war led to a change in McKinley 's cabinet , as the President accepted Sherman 's resignation as Secretary of State ; Day agreed to serve as Secretary until the war 's end . 
 Within a fortnight , the navy had its first victory when the Asiatic Squadron , led by Commodore George Dewey , engaged the Spanish navy at the Battle of Manila Bay in the Philippines , destroying the enemy force without the loss of a single American vessel . Dewey 's overwhelming victory expanded the scope of the war from one centered in the Caribbean to one that would determine the fate of all of Spain 's Pacific colonies . The next month , he increased the number of troops sent to the Philippines and granted the force 's commander , Major General Wesley Merritt , the power to set up legal systems and raise taxes — necessities for a long occupation . By the time the troops arrived in the Philippines at the end of June 1898 , McKinley had decided that Spain would be required to surrender the archipelago to the United States . He professed to be open to all views on the subject ; however , he believed that as the war progressed , the public would come to demand retention of the islands as a prize of war . 
 Meanwhile , in the Caribbean theater , a large force of regulars and volunteers gathered near Tampa , Florida , for an invasion of Cuba . The army faced difficulties in supplying the rapidly expanding force even before they departed for Cuba , but by June , Corbin had made progress in resolving the problems . After lengthy delays , the army , led by Major General William Rufus Shafter , sailed from Florida on June 20 , landing near Santiago de Cuba two days later . Following a skirmish at Las <unk> on June 24 , Shafter 's army engaged the Spanish forces on July 2 in the Battle of San Juan Hill . In an intense day @-@ long battle , the American force was victorious , although both sides suffered heavy casualties . The next day , the Spanish Caribbean squadron , which had been sheltering in Santiago 's harbor , broke for the open sea but was intercepted and destroyed by Rear Admiral William T. Sampson 's North Atlantic Squadron in the largest naval battle of the war . Shafter laid siege to the city of Santiago , which surrendered on July 17 , placing Cuba under effective American control . McKinley and Miles also ordered an invasion of Puerto Rico , which met little resistance when it landed in July . The distance from Spain and the destruction of the Spanish navy made resupply impossible , and the Spanish government began to look for a way to end the war . 
 = = = Peace and territorial gain = = = 
 On July 22 , the Spanish authorized Jules Cambon , the French Ambassador to the United States , to represent Spain in negotiating peace . The Spanish initially wished to restrict the discussion to Cuba , but were quickly forced to recognize that their other possessions would be claimed as spoils of war . McKinley 's cabinet agreed with him that Spain must leave Cuba and Puerto Rico , but they disagreed on the Philippines , with some wishing to annex the entire archipelago and some wishing only to retain a naval base in the area . Although public sentiment seemed to favor annexation of the Philippines , several prominent political leaders – including Bryan , ex @-@ President Grover Cleveland , and the newly formed American Anti @-@ Imperialist League – made their opposition known . 
 McKinley proposed to open negotiations with Spain on the basis of Cuban liberation and Puerto Rican annexation , with the final status of the Philippines subject to further discussion . He stood firmly in that demand even as the military situation on Cuba began to deteriorate when the American army was struck with yellow fever . Spain ultimately agreed to a ceasefire on those terms on August 12 , and treaty negotiations began in Paris in September 1898 . The talks continued until December 18 , when the Treaty of Paris was signed . The United States acquired Puerto Rico and the Philippines as well as the island of Guam , and Spain relinquished its claims to Cuba ; in exchange , the United States agreed to pay Spain $ 20 million . McKinley had difficulty convincing the Senate to approve the treaty by the requisite two @-@ thirds vote , but his lobbying , and that of Vice President Hobart , eventually saw success , as the Senate voted in favor on February 6 , 1899 , 57 to 27 . 
 During the war , McKinley also pursued the annexation of the Republic of Hawaii . The new republic , dominated by American interests , had seized power from the royal government in 1893 . The lame @-@ duck Harrison administration had submitted a treaty of annexation to the Senate ; Cleveland , once he returned to office , had sent a special commission to the islands . After receiving the report , Cleveland withdrew the treaty , stating that the revolution did not reflect the will of Hawaiian citizens . Nevertheless , many Americans favored annexation , and the cause gained momentum as the United States became embroiled in war with Spain . McKinley came to office as a supporter of annexation , and lobbied Congress to adopt his opinion , believing that to do nothing would invite a royalist counter @-@ revolution or a Japanese takeover . Foreseeing difficulty in getting two @-@ thirds of the Senate to approve a treaty of annexation , McKinley instead supported the effort of Democratic Representative Francis G. Newlands of Nevada to accomplish the result by joint resolution of both houses of Congress . The resulting Newlands Resolution passed both houses by wide margins , and McKinley signed it into law on July 8 , 1898 . McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan notes , " McKinley was the guiding spirit behind the annexation of Hawaii , showing ... a firmness in pursuing it " ; the President told Cortelyou , " We need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did California . It is manifest destiny . " Wake Island , an uninhabited atoll between Hawaii and Guam , was claimed for the United States on July 12 , 1898 . 
 = = = Expanding influence overseas = = = 
 In acquiring Pacific possessions for the United States , McKinley expanded the nation 's ability to compete for trade in China . Even before peace negotiations began with Spain , McKinley asked Congress to set up a commission to examine trade opportunities in the region and espoused an " Open Door Policy " , in which all nations would freely trade with China and none would seek to violate that nation 's territorial integrity . When John Hay replaced Day as Secretary of State at the end of the war , he circulated notes to that effect to the European powers . Great Britain favored the idea , but Russia opposed it ; France , Germany , Italy and Japan agreed in principle , but only if all the other nations signed on . 
 Trade with China became imperiled shortly thereafter as the Boxer Rebellion menaced foreigners and their property in China . Americans and other westerners in Peking were besieged and , in cooperation with other western powers , McKinley ordered 5000 troops to the city in June 1900 in the China Relief Expedition . The westerners were rescued the next month , but several Congressional Democrats objected to McKinley dispatching troops without consulting the legislature . McKinley 's actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control over the military . After the rebellion ended , the United States reaffirmed its commitment to the Open Door policy , which became the basis of American policy toward China . 
 Closer to home , McKinley and Hay engaged in negotiations with Britain over the possible construction of a canal across Central America . The Clayton – Bulwer Treaty , which the two nations signed in 1850 , prohibited either from establishing exclusive control over a canal there . The war had exposed the difficulty of maintaining a two @-@ ocean navy without a connection closer than Cape Horn . Now , with American business and military interests even more involved in Asia , a canal seemed more essential than ever , and McKinley pressed for a renegotiation of the treaty . Hay and the British ambassador , Julian Pauncefote , agreed that the United States could control a future canal , provided that it was open to all shipping and not fortified . McKinley was satisfied with the terms , but the Senate rejected them , demanding that the United States be allowed to fortify the canal . Hay was embarrassed by the rebuff and offered his resignation , but McKinley refused it and ordered him to continue negotiations to achieve the Senate 's demands . He was successful , and a new treaty was drafted and approved , but not before McKinley 's assassination in 1901 . 
 = = = Tariffs and bimetallism = = = 
 Two of the great issues of the day , tariff reform and free silver , became intertwined in 1897 . Ways and Means chairman Dingley introduced a new tariff bill ( later called the Dingley Act ) to revise the Wilson – Gorman Tariff Act of 1894 . McKinley supported the bill , which increased tariffs on wool , sugar , and luxury goods , but the proposed new rates alarmed the French , who exported many luxury items to the United States . The Dingley Act passed the House easily , but was delayed in the Senate as they assessed the French objections . French representatives offered to cooperate with the United States in developing an international agreement on bimetallism if the new tariff rates were reduced ; this pleased silverite Republicans in the Senate , whose votes were necessary for passage . The Senate amended the bill to allow limited reciprocity ( giving France some possibility of relief ) , but did not reduce the rates on luxury goods . McKinley signed the bill into law and agreed to begin negotiations on an international bimetallism standard . 
 American negotiators soon concluded a reciprocity treaty with France , and the two nations approached Britain to gauge British enthusiasm for bimetallism . The Prime Minister , Lord Salisbury , and his government showed some interest in the idea and told the American envoy , Edward O. Wolcott , that he would be amenable to reopening the mints in India to silver coinage if the Viceroy 's Executive Council there agreed . News of a possible departure from the gold standard stirred up immediate opposition from its partisans , and misgivings by the Indian administration led Britain to reject the proposal . With the international effort a failure , McKinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced the gold standard . Even without the agreement , agitation for free silver eased as prosperity began to return to the United States and gold from recent strikes in the Yukon and Australia increased the monetary supply even without silver coinage . In the absence of international agreement , McKinley favored legislation to formally affirm the gold standard , but was initially deterred by the silver strength in the Senate . By 1900 , with another campaign ahead and good economic conditions , McKinley urged Congress to pass such a law , and was able to sign the Gold Standard Act on March 14 , 1900 , using a gold pen to do so .

 In the wake of McKinley 's election in 1896 , African Americans were hopeful of progress towards equality . McKinley had spoken out against lynching while governor , and most African Americans who could vote supported him in 1896 . McKinley 's priority , however , was in ending sectionalism , and they were disappointed by his policies and appointments . Although McKinley made some appointments of African Americans to low @-@ level government posts , and received some praise for that , the appointments were less than they had received under previous Republican administrations . Blanche K. Bruce , an African American who during Reconstruction had served as senator from Mississippi , received the post of register at the Treasury Department ; this post was traditionally given to an African American by Republican presidents . McKinley appointed several black postmasters ; however , when whites protested the appointment of Justin W. Lyons as postmaster of Augusta , Georgia , McKinley asked Lyons to withdraw ( he was subsequently given the post of Treasury register after Bruce 's death in 1898 ) . The President did appoint George B. Jackson , a former slave , to the post of customs collector in Presidio , Texas . However , African Americans in northern states felt that their contributions to McKinley 's victory were overlooked ; few were appointed to office . 
 The administration 's response to racial violence was minimal , causing him to lose black support . When black postmasters at <unk> , Georgia in 1897 , and at Lake City , South Carolina the following year , were assaulted , McKinley issued no statement of condemnation . Although black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction , supporters responded by saying there was little the president could do to intervene . Critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn such events , as Harrison had done . 
 According to historian <unk> A. <unk> , " Before the Spanish – American War , the Negroes , in spite of some mistakes , regarded McKinley as the best friend they ever had . " African Americans saw the onset of war in 1898 as an opportunity to display their patriotism ; and black soldiers fought bravely at El Caney and San Juan Hill . African Americans in the peacetime Army had formed elite units ; nevertheless they were harassed by whites as they traveled from the West to Tampa for embarkation to the war . Under pressure from black leaders , McKinley required the War Department to commission black officers above the rank of lieutenant . The heroism of the black troops did not still racial tensions in the South , as the second half of 1898 saw several outbreaks of racial violence ; 11 African Americans were killed in riots in Wilmington , North Carolina . McKinley toured the South in late 1898 , hoping for sectional reconciliation . In addition to visiting Tuskegee Institute and black educator Booker T. Washington , he addressed the Georgia legislature , wearing a badge of gray , and visited Confederate memorials . In his tour of the South , McKinley did not mention the racial tensions or violence . Although the President received a rapturous reception from Southern whites , many African Americans , excluded from official welcoming committees , felt alienated by the President 's words and actions . 
 According to Gould and later biographer Phillips , given the political climate in the South , with white legislatures passing segregationist laws such as that upheld in Plessy v. Ferguson , there was little McKinley could have done to improve race relations , and he did better than later presidents Theodore Roosevelt , who doubted racial equality , and Woodrow Wilson , who supported segregation . However , Gould concluded , " McKinley lacked the vision to transcend the biases of his day and to point toward a better future for all Americans " . 
 = = = Judicial appointments = = = 
 After the retirement of Justice Stephen Johnson Field , McKinley appointed Attorney General Joseph McKenna to the Supreme Court of the United States in December 1897 . The appointment aroused some controversy as McKenna 's critics in the Senate said he was too closely associated with railroad interests and lacked the qualifications of a Supreme Court justice . Despite the objections , McKenna 's nomination was approved unanimously . McKenna responded to the criticism of his legal education by taking some courses at Columbia Law School for several months before taking his seat . Along with his Supreme Court appointment , McKinley appointed six judges to the United States Courts of Appeals , and 28 judges to the United States district courts . 
 = = = 1900 election = = = 
 Republicans were generally successful in state and local elections around the country in 1899 , and McKinley was optimistic about his chances at re @-@ election in 1900 . McKinley 's popularity in his first term assured him of renomination for a second . The only question about the Republican ticket concerned the vice presidential nomination ; McKinley needed a new running mate as Hobart had died in late 1899 . McKinley initially favored Elihu Root , who had succeeded Alger as Secretary of War , but McKinley decided that Root was doing too good a job at the War Department to move him . He considered other prominent candidates , including Allison and Cornelius N. Bliss , but none were as popular as the Republican party 's rising star , Theodore Roosevelt . After a stint as Assistant Secretary of the Navy , Roosevelt had resigned and raised a cavalry regiment ; they fought bravely in Cuba , and Roosevelt returned home covered in glory . Elected governor of New York on a reform platform in 1898 , Roosevelt had his eye on the presidency . Many supporters recommended him to McKinley for the second spot on the ticket , and Roosevelt believed it would be an excellent stepping stone to the presidency in 1904 . McKinley remained uncommitted in public , but Hanna was firmly opposed to the New York governor . The Ohio senator considered the New Yorker overly impulsive ; his stance was undermined by the efforts of political boss and New York Senator Thomas Platt , who , disliking Roosevelt 's reform agenda , sought to sideline the governor by making him vice president . 
 When the Republican convention began in Philadelphia that June , no vice presidential candidate had overwhelming support , but Roosevelt had the broadest range of support from around the country . McKinley affirmed that the choice belonged to the convention , not to him . On June 21 , McKinley was unanimously renominated and , with Hanna 's reluctant acquiescence , Roosevelt was nominated for vice president on the first ballot . The Democratic convention convened the next month in Kansas City and nominated William Jennings Bryan , setting up a rematch of the 1896 contest . 
 The candidates were the same , but the issues of the campaign had shifted : free silver was still a question that animated many voters , but the Republicans focused on victory in war and prosperity at home as issues they believed favored their party . Democrats knew the war had been popular , even if the imperialism issue was less sure , so they focused on the issue of trusts and corporate power , painting McKinley as the servant of capital and big business . As in 1896 , Bryan embarked on a speaking tour around the country while McKinley stayed at home , this time making only one speech , to accept his nomination . Roosevelt emerged as the campaign 's primary speaker and Hanna helped the cause working to settle a coal miners strike in Pennsylvania . Bryan 's campaigning failed to excite the voters as it had in 1896 , and McKinley never doubted that he would be re @-@ elected . On November 6 , 1900 , he was proven correct , winning the largest victory for any Republican since 1872 . Bryan carried only four states outside the solid South , and McKinley even won Bryan 's home state of Nebraska . 
 = = = Second term = = = 
 Soon after his second inauguration on March 4 , 1901 , William and Ida McKinley undertook a six @-@ week tour of the nation . Traveling mostly by rail , the McKinleys were to travel through the South to the Southwest , and then up the Pacific coast and east again , to conclude with a visit on June 13 , 1901 , to the Pan @-@ American Exposition in Buffalo , New York . However , the First Lady fell ill in California , causing her husband to limit his public events and cancel a series of speeches he had planned to give urging trade reciprocity . He also postponed the visit to the fair until September , planning a month in Washington and two in Canton before the Buffalo visit . 
 = = = Assassination and death throes = = = 
 Although McKinley enjoyed meeting the public , Cortelyou was concerned with his security due to recent assassinations by anarchists in Europe , such as the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy the previous year , and twice tried to remove a public reception from the President 's rescheduled visit to the Exposition . McKinley refused , and Cortelyou arranged for additional security for the trip . On September 5 , the President delivered his address at the fairgrounds , before a crowd of some 50 @,@ 000 people . In his final speech , McKinley urged reciprocity treaties with other nations to assure American manufacturers access to foreign markets . He intended the speech as a keynote to his plans for a second term . 
 One man in the crowd , Leon Czolgosz , hoped to assassinate McKinley . He had managed to get close to the presidential podium , but did not fire , uncertain of hitting his target . Czolgosz , since hearing a speech by anarchist Emma Goldman in Cleveland , had decided to do something heroic ( in his own mind ) for the cause . After his failure to get close enough on the fifth , Czolgosz waited the next day at the Temple of Music on the Exposition grounds , where the President was to meet the public . Czolgosz concealed his gun in a handkerchief , and , when he reached the head of the line , shot McKinley twice in the abdomen . 
 McKinley urged his aides to break the news gently to Ida , and to call off the mob that had set on Czolgosz — a request that may have saved his assassin 's life . McKinley was taken to the Exposition aid station , where the doctor was unable to locate the second bullet . Although a primitive X @-@ ray machine was being exhibited on the Exposition grounds , it was not used . McKinley was taken to the Milburn House . 
 In the days after the shooting McKinley appeared to improve . Doctors issued increasingly optimistic bulletins . Members of the Cabinet , who had rushed to Buffalo on hearing the news , dispersed ; Vice President Roosevelt departed on a camping trip to the Adirondacks . Leech wrote , 
 It is difficult to interpret the optimism with which the President 's physicians looked for his recovery . There was obviously the most serious danger that his wounds would become septic . In that case , he would almost certainly die , since drugs to control infection did not exist ... [ Prominent New York City physician ] Dr. McBurney was by far the worst offender in showering sanguine assurances on the correspondents . As the only big @-@ city surgeon on the case , he was eagerly questioned and quoted , and his rosy prognostications largely contributed to the delusion of the American public . 
 Unknown to the doctors , the gangrene that would kill him was growing on the walls of his stomach , slowly poisoning his blood . On the morning of September 13 , McKinley took a turn for the worse . Relatives and friends gathered around the death bed . At 2 : 15 a.m. on September 14 , President McKinley died . Theodore Roosevelt had rushed back and took the oath of office as president in Buffalo . Czolgosz , put on trial for murder nine days after McKinley 's death , was found guilty , sentenced to death on September 26 , and executed by electric chair on October 29 , 1901 . 
 = = Funeral , memorials , and legacy = = 
 = = = Funeral and resting place = = = 
 According to Gould , " The nation experienced a wave of genuine grief at the news of McKinley 's passing . " The stock market , faced with sudden uncertainty , suffered a steep decline — almost unnoticed in the mourning . The nation focused its attention on the casket that made its way by train , first to Washington , where it first lay in the East Room of the Executive Mansion , and then in state in the Capitol , and then was taken to Canton . A hundred thousand people passed by the open casket in the Capitol Rotunda , many having waited hours in the rain ; in Canton , an equal number did the same at the Stark County Courthouse on September 18 . The following day , a funeral service was held at the First Methodist Church ; the casket was then sealed and taken to the McKinley house , where relatives paid their final respects . It was then transported to the receiving vault at West Lawn Cemetery in Canton , to await the construction of the memorial to McKinley already being planned . 
 There was a widespread expectation that Ida McKinley would not long survive her husband ; one family friend stated , as William McKinley lay dying , that they should be prepared for a double funeral . This did not occur ; the former first lady accompanied her husband on the funeral train . Leech noted " the circuitous journey was a cruel ordeal for the woman who huddled in a compartment of the funeral train , praying that the Lord would take her with her Dearest Love " . She was thought too weak to attend the services in Washington or Canton , although she listened at the door to the service for her husband in her house on North Market Street . She remained in Canton for the remainder of her life , setting up a shrine in her house , and often visiting the receiving vault , until her death at age 59 on May 26 , 1907 . She died only months before the completion of the large marble monument to her husband in Canton , which was dedicated by President Roosevelt on September 30 , 1907 . William and Ida McKinley are interred there with their daughters , atop a hillside overlooking the city of Canton . 
 = = = Other memorials = = = 
 In addition to the Canton site there are many memorials to McKinley . There is a monument at his birthplace in Niles ; 20 Ohio schools bear his name . There are several schools in the United States named McKinley School . Nearly a million dollars was pledged by contributors or allocated from public funds for the construction of McKinley memorials in the year after his death . Phillips suggests the significant number of major memorials to McKinley in Ohio reflected the expectation among Ohioans in the years after McKinley 's death that he would be ranked among the great presidents . Statues to him may be found in more than a dozen states ; his name has been bestowed on streets , civic organizations , and libraries . McKinley 's name is also used in the large inner @-@ city Honolulu , Hawaii high school , President William McKinley High School . 
 Denali , in central Alaska , was named Mount McKinley in support of the then newly minted Republican nominee for President until The Alaska Board of Geographic Names changed the name of the mountain to Denali in 1975 , which is how it was called by locals . The mountain 's name was changed to Denali on the federal level by the Department of the Interior as a part of a visit to Alaska by President Barack Obama in August 2015 ; its summit , at 20 @,@ 310 feet ( 6 @,@ 190 m ) , is the highest point in North America . Similarly , until its name was changed to Denali National Park on December 2 , 1980 , under congressional legislation signed by President Jimmy Carter , the park in which it is located was known as Mount McKinley National Park . 
 = = = Legacy and historical image = = = 
 McKinley 's biographer , H. Wayne Morgan remarks that McKinley died the most beloved president in history . However , the young , enthusiastic Roosevelt quickly captured public attention after his predecessor 's death . The new president made little effort to secure the trade reciprocity McKinley had intended to negotiate with other nations . Controversy and public interest surrounded Roosevelt throughout the seven and a half years of his presidency as memories of McKinley faded ; by 1920 , according to Gould , McKinley 's administration was deemed no more than " a mediocre prelude to the vigor and energy of Theodore Roosevelt 's " . Beginning in the 1950s , McKinley received more favorable evaluations ; nevertheless , in surveys ranking American presidents , he has generally been placed near the middle , often trailing contemporaries such as Hayes and Cleveland . Morgan suggests that this relatively low ranking is due to a perception among historians that while many decisions during McKinley 's presidency profoundly affected the nation 's future , he more followed public opinion than led it , and that McKinley 's standing has suffered from altered public expectations of the presidency . 
 There has been broad agreement among historians that McKinley 's election was at the time of a transition between two political eras , dubbed the Third and Fourth Party Systems . Kenneth F. Warren emphasizes the national commitment to a pro @-@ business , industrial , and modernizing program , represented by McKinley . Historian Daniel P. <unk> argued that McKinley 's personal control of the 1896 campaign gave him the opportunity to reshape the presidency — rather than simply follow the party platform — by representing himself as the voice of the people . However , more recently , as Republican political official Karl Rove exalted McKinley as the agent of sweeping political realignment in the 2000s , some scholars , such as David Mayhew , questioned whether the 1896 election truly represented a realignment , thereby placing in issue whether McKinley deserves credit for it . Historian Michael J. <unk> argued in 2005 that while it is tempting to see McKinley as the key figure in the transition from congressional domination of government to the modern , powerful president , this change was an incremental process through the late 19th and early 20th centuries . 
 Phillips writes that McKinley 's low rating is undeserved , and that he should be ranked just after the great presidents such as Washington and Lincoln . He pointed to McKinley 's success at building an electoral coalition that kept the Republicans mostly in power for a generation . Phillips believes that part of McKinley 's legacy is the men he included in his administration , who dominated the Republican Party for a quarter century after his death . These officials included Cortelyou , who served in three Cabinet positions under Roosevelt , and Dawes , who became vice president under Coolidge . Other McKinley appointees who later became major figures include Day , who Roosevelt elevated to the Supreme Court where he remained nearly twenty years , and William Howard Taft , whom McKinley had made Governor @-@ General of the Philippines and who succeeded Roosevelt as president . 
 A controversial aspect of McKinley 's presidency is territorial expansion and the question of imperialism — with the exception of the Philippines , granted independence in 1946 , the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley . The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of American empire . Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of America as a world power ; he expects the debate over McKinley 's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution , and notes that however one judges McKinley 's actions in American expansion , one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better . 
 Morgan alludes to the rise of interest in McKinley as part of the debate over the more assertive American foreign policy of recent decades : 
 McKinley was a major actor in some of the most important events in American history . His decisions shaped future policies and public attitudes . He usually rises in the estimation of scholars who study his life in detail . Even those who disagree with his policies and decisions see him as an active , responsible , informed participant in charge of decision making . His dignified demeanor and subtle operations keep him somewhat remote from public perception . But he is once again at the center of events , where he started .

 The Bog People : Iron @-@ Age Man Preserved is an archaeological study of the bog bodies of Northern Europe written by the Danish archaeologist P.V. Glob . First published in 1965 by Gyldendal under the Danish title of <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> i 2000 <unk> , it was translated into English by the English archaeologist Rupert Bruce @-@ Mitford and published by Faber and Faber in 1969 . In 1966 it was translated into German by Thyra <unk> and published by Winkler <unk> Munich under the title Die <unk> im Moor ( English : The Sleepers in the Bog ) . 
 The Bog People is divided into six chapters . The first is devoted to Tollund Man , and the second to Grauballe Man , two of the best known Iron Age bog bodies to have been discovered in Jutland , Denmark . The third and fourth chapters are devoted to the wider context of bog bodies first in Denmark and then in other parts of Europe . The final two chapters are devoted to a wider exposition of life and death in Iron Age Denmark . 
 Glob 's book received positive reviews from both Barry Cunliffe in Nature and Ralph M. Rowlett in American Anthropologist . They praised Glob 's arguments as well as his writing style and use of illustrations , alongside Bruce @-@ Mitford 's translation . In subsequent decades , it has received both praise and criticism from specialists in the field , who have lauded the publicity which it brought to the subject , but rejected many of Glob 's conclusions as being based on insufficient evidence . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Chapter one , " The Tollund Man " , is devoted to the bog body of the same name that was discovered in 1950 in Tollund Fell , <unk> Dal in Jutland , Denmark . Glob discusses the excavation of the corpse , and his own personal involvement with the operation . Outlining the find 's removal to the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen , he then outlines the manner in which the head was conserved for public display at the Silkeborg Museum . Alongside this he also discusses the archaeological context of Tollund Man , examining the manner in which he was executed , his clothing , and the contents of his last meal . The second chapter , entitled " The Grauballe Man " , deals with the eponymous bog body found in 1952 at <unk> Fen , located 11 miles ( 18 km ) east of Tolland . Like with the previous chapter , Glob discusses his own personal investigation into the body , outlining its discovery and conservation , as well as the context of his death and burial . 
 In the third chapter , " Bog People in Denmark " , Glob notes that there have been over 150 bog bodies found in Denmark , and proceeds to provide a number of examples including Haraldskær Woman and the <unk> bodies , in doing so highlighting the similarities that exist between them . Noting that many of these were discovered in the 19th and early 20th centuries , he explains that little can be known for most of them because methods of archaeological investigation and conservation were unavailable at the time . Chapter four , " Bog People in Other Countries " , explores similar bog bodies which have been discovered in neighbouring Germany and the Netherlands , such as <unk> I , making reference to the cataloging project undertaken by the German archaeologist Alfred <unk> . 
 " How They Lived " is the title of the fifth chapter , and explores the wider context of life in Iron Age Denmark , dealing with such issues as class divisions , houses and garments . The final chapter , " When Death Came " , looks at the place of death in Iron Age Denmark , outlining ordinary funerary remains , which include both cremation and inhumation . Contrasting these methods of dealing with the dead to the corpses left in the bogs , he argues that the latter must represent evidence for a widespread tradition of human sacrifice devoted to a fertility goddess , citing the writings of Tacitus as evidence . 
 = = Reception = = 
 = = = Academic reviews = = = 
 The Nature journal published a review provided by the English archaeologist Barry Cunliffe of the University of Southampton . He expresses only one disappointment with Glob 's work , that there is what he sees as a lack of information on the daily life and social structure of Iron Age Denmark . He nevertheless feels compensated by the final chapter , which he describes as representing Glob " at his best , building @-@ up , in detective @-@ style fashion " , a picture of ritual behavior in the Iron Age . Praising the use of photographs as " brilliant " , he refers to the " attractive " translation of Bruce @-@ Mitford , and considers the overall effect to be " stimulating and provocative " . Summarizing The Bog People , he labels it a " splendid book , full of detail and fascination " for both specialists and a wider readership interested in archaeology . 
 Ralph M. Rowlett of the University of Missouri wrote a review of The Bog People for the journal American Anthropologist . He began his review by describing his background interest in bog bodies , and highlighting that he had married one of Glob 's graduate students . He proceeds to note that there is much in the book that would be of interest to anthropologists , and he hoped that they would not be put off by its use of " gossip and anecdote " and its " intensely personal and culturally ultra @-@ Danish tone " , which he attributes to Glob 's attempts to reach a wider , non @-@ academic audience . Praising Glob 's use of ethnohistory and epic literature to illuminate the Early Iron Age , he claims that The Bog People represents " one of the best modern ethnographic descriptions of the North <unk> of that era " and that it furthermore provides evidence in support of Tacitus ' claims . Rowlett goes on to praise Bruce @-@ Mitford 's translation , but believes that he has a " slight tendency to over @-@ translate " with place names , and also disagrees with his decision to convert centimeters into inches . Ending his review , Rowlett notes that along with Alfred <unk> 's catalog of bog bodies , The Bog People represented " a starter for a by no means exhausted field . " 
 = = = Wider reception = = = 
 In an academic paper discussing the bog bodies which was published in 1995 , C.S. Briggs criticised Glob for jumping to conclusions that were not supported by the evidence , exclaiming " Can Glob 's book today actually pass muster as responsible popular scholarship ? " . In particular , they highlighted that he ascribed many bodies to the Iron Age when they had not been securely carbon dated and that he <unk> proclaimed the <unk> Lady from Medieval Ireland to be a Danish Viking despite a lack of supporting evidence . 
 In his 1996 book on bog bodies , Wijnand Van der <unk> paid homage to Glob 's The Bog Bodies , describing it as a " highly accessible work " which had done more than any other to bring publicity to the bog cadavers . <unk> that he was filled with admiration for the work , he noted that he wished that he himself had written it 30 years before . In their 2007 edited volume on the reinvestigation of Grauballe Man , Pauline <unk> and Niels <unk> stated that Glob 's book had represented a " major contribution " to the study of bog bodies which " awoke many people 's interest in prehistory " . 
 In her 2009 study of the cultural and artistic reception of the bog bodies , Karin Sanders noted that she had first become interested in archaeology through reading a copy of <unk> in her primary school 's library , near to Copenhagen . Proceeding to describe the book as " a classic " , she noted that even in the 21st century , it continued to offer the " source book " for artistic expressions of bog bodies . Proceeding to explore the influence of Glob 's tome , she noted that many artists and writers had used it as a basis for learning more about the bog bodies , to whom their works were dedicated , and that Glob himself had successfully blended an engaging narrative with archaeological information , and that he was " profoundly influenced by the potentiality of interaction between fact and fiction . " 
 = Trespass in English law = 
 Trespass in English law is an area of tort law broadly divided into three groups : trespass to the person , trespass to goods and trespass to land . 
 Trespass to the person comes in three variants : assault , which is " to act in such a way that the claimant believes he is about to be attacked " ; battery , " the intentional and direct application of force to another person " ; and false imprisonment , " depriving the claimant of freedom of movement , without a lawful justification for doing so " . All three require that the act be a direct and intentional act , with indirect or unintentional acts falling under the tort of negligence . Battery and assault require the claimant to establish that the defendant intended to act , while false imprisonment is a tort of strict liability . The guiding principle behind all three is based on the statement of Goff , LJ , who stated in Collins v Wilcock that " any person 's body is inviolate " , excepting normal , day @-@ to @-@ day physical contact . 
 Trespass to goods is defined as " wrongful physical interference with goods that are in the possession of another " , and is covered not only by the common law , but also by the Torts ( Interference with Goods ) Act 1977 . The " trespass " can be as little as touching or moving the goods , given the right circumstances . It is unknown whether intention is required for a claim under trespass to goods , as the matter has never gone to court ; the courts have confirmed that for damages to be awarded for harm suffered , the harm must have been reasonably foreseeable . 
 Trespass to land involves the " unjustifiable interference with land which is in the immediate and exclusive possession of another " ; it is both a tort and , in certain circumstances , a crime under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 . It is not necessary to prove that harm was suffered to bring a claim , and is instead actionable per se . While most trespasses to land are intentional , the courts have decided that it could also be committed negligently . Accidental trespass also incurs liability . 
 = = Trespass to the person = = 
 The general principle is that a trespass to the person must be a direct and intentional act , while if it was indirect or unintentional the tort of negligence is more appropriate , as established in Letang v Cooper . The tort of trespass to the person contains three possible types ; assault , battery and false imprisonment . 
 = = = Assault = = = 
 In English law , an assault means to act in such a way that the claimant or victim apprehends the application of immediate unlawful force upon themselves . The key elements of the tort are therefore that the defendant acts , and does so in such a way that the claimant is put in fear of " immediate physical violence " . There is no requirement that actual damage be caused . In R v Costanza , the courts held that threats made by a stalker could be assault , while in R v Ireland , the House of Lords said that in the right situation ( specifically , harassing phone calls ) silence could be enough . In some situations an act which would otherwise be assault can be mitigated by the language used . In Tuberville v Savage , the defendant reached for his sword and told the claimant that " if it were not [ court ] time , I would not take such language from you " ; it was held that despite the threatening gesture , this meant the claimant was not in immediate danger . The actions must give the claimant reasonable expectation that the defendant is going to use violence ; if a fist was raised in front of the claimant , it could be enough . If the fist was raised from inside a police van following arrest , it would not . 
 = = = Battery = = = 
 Battery is defined as " the intentional and direct application of force to another person " , and has three elements ; force , direct application and intent . The courts have also added a requirement of " hostility " or lack of consent in many cases . As with assault , there is no need to show that damage was caused . Any application of physical contact , regardless of harm caused , can constitute force . In Collins v Wilcock , a female police officer took hold of a woman 's arm , intending to talk to her on suspicion of soliciting contrary to the Street Offences Act 1959 . The woman scratched the female police officer 's arm . As the female police officer had gone beyond her duties in grabbing the woman ( since she did not intend to charge her with an offence , but was still using force ) it was held that this constituted " force " . Goff LJ wrote that the fundamental principle is that any person 's body is inviolate , except in situations where the bodily contact " [ falls ] within a general exception embracing all physical contact which is generally acceptable in the ordinary conduct of daily life " . 
 The defendant must intend to carry out the act which constitutes trespass for it to be valid . This does not require the defendant to intend harm ; in Nash v Sheen , a hairdresser who put a tone rinse on the claimant ( when the claimant had given permission for a perm ) was found liable in battery after it caused a rash . In Livingstone v Ministry of Defence , the defendant , a soldier , had intended to shoot someone with a baton round , which went wide and hit the claimant . Even though he had not intended to hit the claimant , it was held that because he had intended to fire the baton round in the first place , he was liable . The final element occasionally added to the tort is the hostility of the action ; in Wilson v Pringle , it was decided that the onus is on the claimant to show that the force was hostile , except in such situations where it is self @-@ evident . This was undermined by R v F , in which Goff wrote that he " respectfully doubts whether [ the requirement to show hostility ] is correct " , in line with his comment in Collins . 
 An extension to battery was given in Wilkinson v Downton , where emotional distress was considered a possible battery despite no physical force being used . The defendant told the claimant ( as a practical joke ) that her husband had been seriously injured . As a result the claimant suffered a nervous disorder and was thought to be suicidal for a time . It was held that such an action will be valid under battery where it is calculated to cause physical damage and does so . The principle was extended by <unk> v Bush , in 1993 , where there was a risk that the defendant 's actions would cause physical or psychiatric damage . The tort set down in Wilkinson is normally considered a separate tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress . 
 = = = False imprisonment = = = 
 False imprisonment is defined as " depriving the claimant of freedom of movement , without a lawful justification for doing so " . Unlike assault and battery , false imprisonment is a tort of strict liability : no intention on the behalf of the defendant is needed , but the imprisonment must be caused by a deliberate act ( as decided in Sayers v Harlow Urban District Council , where a faulty lock , not a deliberate act from another party , caused a woman to become trapped in a public toilet ) and must be unlawful . The imprisonment of a lawfully convicted criminal is not false , nor is the arrest of a suspect if done in line with the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 and Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 . 
 Imprisonment is considered any restraint on the freedom of movement , for however short a time . In Austin and another v Metropolitan Police Commissioner , seven hours was considered a sufficient period of time to constitute false imprisonment ( although the claim was ultimately rejected due to the circumstances of a potentially hostile crowd of demonstrators ) . The requirement is complete restraint ; in Bird v Jones , the defendant fenced off part of a footpath for use as a viewing point for a boat race . The claimant , accustomed to walking across it , climbed into the enclosure ; the defendants refused to let him pass . They were found not liable for false imprisonment , as another way across existed . There is on the other hand no requirement that the claimant actually attempt to leave , as in Grainger v Hill , or even that he knows he is being prevented from leaving , as in <unk> v Graham @-@ White Aviation Co Ltd . 
 = = = Defences = = = 
 There are many defences to trespasses against the person ; the stranger are the right of parents to commit assault and battery against their children for " chastisement " under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 , and the right of the captain of a ship to discipline his crew , as in Hook v Cunard Steamship Co Ltd . There is also a right to eject a trespasser to land using reasonable force , and a defendant is also not liable for " inevitable accidents " , as in Stanley v Powell , where a ricocheting pellet was ruled to be accidental . Individuals and bodies will not be liable for imprisonment , battery or assault if doing so in line with statutory authorities , such as the Criminal Law Act 1967 . 
 A commonly used defence for the torts of trespass against the person is that of <unk> non fit injuria , or consent . If a claimant participates in a sporting activity in which physical contact is ordinary conduct , such as rugby , they are considered to have consented . This is not the case if the physical contact went beyond what could be expected , as in R v <unk> , or where the injuries were suffered not from the claimant 's participation in the sport but inadequate safety measures taken , as in Watson v British Boxing Board of Control . The same general rule applies to people who voluntarily take part in fights , although only if the injuries caused are proportionate , as in Lane v Holloway . If the claimant is informed by a doctor of the broad risks of a medical procedure , there will be no claim under trespass against the person for resulting harm caused ; the claimant 's agreement constitutes " real consent " , as in Chatterton v Gerson . Consent for medical procedures is different in cases where the claimant does not have the mental capacity to consent . In F v West Berkshire Health Authority , it was held that in such situations the requirements are that there " must be a necessity to act when it is not practical to communicate with the assisted person ... [ and ] the action taken must be such as a reasonable person would in all the circumstances take , acting in the best interests of the assisted person " . 
 Self @-@ defence is also a valid defence to trespasses against the person , assuming that it constituted the use of " reasonable force which they honestly and reasonably believe is necessary to protect themselves or someone else , or property " . The force used must be proportionate to the threat , as ruled in Cockroft v Smith . If the action is undertaken to prevent a crime , Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 permits it assuming that it is " reasonable under the circumstances " . 
 = = Trespass to goods = = 
 Trespass to goods is defined as " wrongful physical interference with goods that are in the possession of another " . It is covered not only by the common law , but also by the Torts ( Interference with Goods ) Act 1977 , which was written to clear up the confusing rules on trespass to goods which had evolved over the centuries . It is similar to the tort of conversion , which covers the interference with goods in a way which is inconsistent with the rights of the owner . " Physical interference " is usually the taking or destroying of goods , but can be as minor as touching or moving them in the right circumstances . In Kirk v Gregory , the defendant moved jewellery from one room to another , where it was stolen . The deceased owner 's executor successfully sued her for trespass to goods . Goods cover almost any physical object , including animals , as in Slater v Swann , but not organs , as in AB & Ors v Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust . " Possession " has the standard legal meaning , referring to the claimant 's right to use , control or deal with the item . This can include owners , but also <unk> . 
 It is unknown what mental element is expected in cases of trespass to goods ; while trespass to the person requires intent , the requirements for trespass to goods have never been tested in court . The common remedy is damages , which may be awarded regardless of if any actual harm is suffered ; where there is damage , the defendant will only be liable if he could have reasonably foreseen it , as in Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co ( No 5 ) . Valid defences are those of statutory authority , consent , where it is necessary to interfere with the goods , or jus tertii . 
 = = Trespass to land = = 
 In English law , trespass to land involves the " unjustifiable interference with land which is in the immediate and exclusive possession of another " . It is not necessary to prove that harm was suffered to bring a claim , and is instead actionable per se . While most trespasses to land are intentional , in League Against Cruel Sports v Scott , the courts decided that it could also be committed negligently . Accidental trespass also incurs liability , with an exception for entering land adjoining a road unintentionally ( such as in a car accident ) , as in River Wear Commissioners v Adamson . Although previously a pure tort , the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 created some circumstances in which trespass to land can also be a crime . 
 Land is defined as the surface , subsoil , airspace and anything permanently attached to the land , such as houses . The rights of landowners over airspace are not unlimited ; in Bernstein of Leigh v <unk> & General Ltd , the action for trespass failed because the violation of airspace took place several hundred metres above the land . This was backed up by the Civil Aviation Act 1982 , which provides that it is not trespass if the aircraft is flying at a reasonable height . An overhanging crane can constitute trespass , as in <unk> v Costain , as can an advertising sign , as in <unk> v Imperial Tobacco Co . Possession does not necessarily mean the ownership of land , but the right to eject or exclude others from it . 
 = = = Interference = = = 
 The main element of the tort is " interference " . This must be both direct and physical , with indirect interference instead being covered by negligence or nuisance . " Interference " covers any physical entry to land , as well as the abuse of a right of entry . If the person has the right to enter the land but remains after this right expires , this is also trespass . It is also a trespass to throw anything on the land . For the purposes of trespass , the person who owns the land on which a road rests is treated as the owner ; it is not , however , a trespass to use that road if public . In Hickman v <unk> , it was established that any use of a road that went beyond using it for its normal purpose could constitute a trespass , but this was altered by DPP v Jones . Lord Irvine , giving the leading judgment , said that " the public highway is a public place which the public may enjoy for any reasonable purpose , providing that the activity in question does not amount to a public or private nuisance and does not obstruct the highway by reasonably impeding the primary right of the public to pass and <unk> ; within these qualifications there is a public right of peaceful assembly on the highway " . 
 = = = Defences = = = 
 There are several defences to trespass to land ; licence , justification by law , necessity and jus tertii . Licence is express or implied permission , given by the possessor of land , to be on that land . If a licence is lawfully revoked , a licence @-@ holder becomes a trespasser if they remain on the land . Justification by law refers to those situations in which there is statutory authority permitting a person to go onto land , such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 , which allows the police to enter land for the purposes of carrying out an arrest . Jus tertii is where the defendant can prove that the land is not possessed by the claimant , but by a third party , as in Doe d Carter v Barnard . The exception to this defence is if the claimant is a tenant and the defendant a landlord who had no right to give the claimant his lease . Necessity is the situation in which it is vital to commit the trespass ; in Esso Petroleum Co v Southport Corporation , the captain of a ship committed trespass by allowing oil to flood a shoreline . This was necessary to protect his ship and crew , however , and the defence of necessity was accepted . 
 = Tales of Wonder ( magazine ) = 
 Tales of Wonder was a British science fiction magazine which was launched in 1937 with Walter Gillings as editor . It was published by The World 's Work , a subsidiary of William Heinemann , as part of a series of genre titles that included Tales of Mystery and Detection and Tales of the Uncanny . <unk> was able to attract some good material , despite the low payment rates he was able to offer ; he also included many reprints from U.S. science fiction magazines . The magazine was apparently more successful than the other genre titles issued by The World 's Work , since Tales of Wonder was the only one to publish more than a single issue . 
 Arthur C. Clarke made his first professional sale to Tales of Wonder , with two science articles . Gillings also published William F. Temple 's first story , some early material by John Wyndham , and " The <unk> @-@ r @-@ <unk> " by Eric Frank Russell . American writers who appeared in the magazine included Murray Leinster and Jack Williamson ; these were both reprints , but some new material from the U.S. did appear , including Lloyd A. Eshbach 's " Out of the Past " , and S.P. Meek 's " The Mentality Machine " . With the advent of World War II , paper shortages and Gillings ' call up into the army made it increasingly difficult to continue , and the sixteenth issue , dated Spring 1942 , was the last . Tales of Wonder was not the first British science fiction magazine , but it was the first one aimed at an adult market , and its success made it apparent that a science fiction magazine could survive in the U.K. 
 = = Publication history = = 
 The first U.S. science fiction ( sf ) magazine , Amazing Stories , was imported into the U.K. from its launch in 1926 , and other magazines from the U.S. market were also available from an early date . However , no British sf magazine appeared until 1934 , when Pearson 's launched Scoops , a weekly in tabloid format aimed at the juvenile market . Soon Haydn Dimmock , Scoops ' editor , began to receive more sophisticated stories , targeted at an adult audience ; he tried to change the magazine 's focus to include more mature fiction but within twenty issues falling sales led Pearson 's to kill the magazine . The failure of Scoops gave British publishers the impression that Britain could not support a science fiction publication . 
 Despite this failure , only a year later , George Newnes , Ltd . , the publisher of The Strand magazine , decided to launch a group of four genre pulp magazines , and to include a science fiction title . The editor , T. Stanhope Sprigg , had help from Walter Gillings , a British science fiction reader who had been active in fan circles since the early 1930s , in searching for good submissions , but the project was placed on hold after fifteen months . Gillings next approached The World 's Work , a subsidiary of William Heinemann , who were already publishing titles such as Tales of Mystery and Detection and Tales of the Uncanny , as part of their Master Thriller series . Gillings had heard that The World 's Work were planning a science fiction magazine ; as it turned out this was not the case , but Gillings was quickly able to persuade them to add science fiction to their list . He was asked to prepare a single issue of 80 @,@ 000 words to test the market . The World 's Work reprinted a good deal of American fiction and since they were only paying for reprint rights their rates were lower than was usual for new fiction . Gillings was given a budget of 10 / 6 ( ten shillings and sixpence ) per thousand words : the low rate discouraged those writers who could sell to the better @-@ paying American magazines . Newer writers were glad of the chance to develop a British market for their work , though most American writers were unimpressed . 
 The first issue of Tales of Wonder appeared in June 1937 . Sales were good enough for The World 's Work to continue publication , and from Spring 1938 the magazine appeared on a quarterly schedule , with occasional omissions . None of the other titles in the Master Thriller series ever turned into a separate magazine , so it was evidently selling well . The success of Tales of Wonder led Newnes to believe that they had been wrong to turn down Gillings , and in 1938 they launched Fantasy as a competitor . 
 The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 did not immediately lead to paper shortages , but paper began to be rationed in April 1940 , and the page count , which had already dropped from 128 to 96 , fell to 72 by 1941 . Gillings was called up for military service , and for a while he was able to edit the magazine from his army camp , but the magazine eventually ceased publication with the Spring 1942 issue . 
 = = Contents and reception = = 
 American science fiction magazines had by the mid @-@ 1930s begun to publish some more sophisticated stories than the straightforward adventure fiction that was a staple of the earliest years of the genre . Gillings decided that many British science fiction readers would not be familiar with most of the developments in American sf , and so he did not make a point of seeking innovative and original material . The first issue contained " The Perfect Creature " , an early story by John Wyndham , under the name " John Beynon " , as well as " The <unk> @-@ r @-@ <unk> " , by Eric Frank Russell . The second issue included Wyndham 's novel Sleepers of Mars , and William F. Temple 's " Lunar Lilliput " , which was Temple 's first science fiction sale . " <unk> 's Hands " , a story by David H. Keller , also appeared in the second issue , reprinted from a U.S. magazine ; Gillings claimed that this was to introduce British science fiction readers to American developments in sf , but in fact it was because he was having trouble obtaining good quality material from British writers . 
 Other reprints acquired by Gillings included Murray Leinster 's " The Mad Planet " and its sequel , " The Red Dust " , and two stories by Jack Williamson : his first sale , " The Metal Man " , along with " The Moon Era " ; these were both by American writers though Gillings tried to reprint stories from the U.S. markets by British writers when he could . Reprints were not restricted to American and British authors , or the U.S. pulp market , however : Gillings also ran " The Planet Wrecker " by R. Coutts Armour , an Australian writer who used the pseudonym " Coutts Brisbane " ; the story had originally appeared in The Red Magazine in 1914 . Some new stories from American writers did appear , including Lloyd A. Eshbach 's " Out of the Past " , and S.P. Meek 's " The Mentality Machine " . Gillings ran competitions for reader essays , one of which was won by Ken Bulmer , later a well @-@ known British science fiction writer , and he encouraged fans to contribute , with articles and fillers . The most significant writer introduced by Gillings was undoubtedly Arthur C. Clarke , whose first sales were to Gillings , for the science articles " Man 's Empire of Tomorrow " and " We Can Rocket to the Moon — Now ! " , which were published in the Winter 1938 and Summer 1939 issues . 
 Science fiction historian Mike Ashley regards Tales of Wonder as " a lively , entertaining and enjoyable magazine " . Its success demonstrated that there was a market in Britain for a magazine aimed at adult science fiction readers , despite the earlier failure of Scoops , and in 1938 George Newnes , Ltd. went ahead with their much @-@ delayed plans for an sf magazine , Fantasy , having seen the success of Tales of Wonder . 
 = = Bibliographic details = = 
 Tales of Wonder was published in pulp format for all 16 issues . It began at 128 pages ; this was cut to 96 pages with the Winter 1939 issue ; then to 80 pages with the Autumn 1940 issue ; and finally to 72 pages for the last three issues . It was edited throughout by Walter Gillings , and was priced at 1 / - . There was no volume numbering ; each issue was numbered consecutively .
