 = You Are the One ( Argentine TV series ) = 
 You Are the One ( Spanish : Sos mi vida , lit . : " You Are My Life " ) is a 2006 Argentine romantic comedy television series , directed by Rodolfo Antúnez and Jorge Bechara and broadcast by El Trece between January 16 , 2006 and January 9 , 2007 . It is the second telenovela starring Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro as lead actors . The production included many location shootings , even during the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany , and many guest stars . 
 The plot follows the love story of Martín Quesada , an affluent businessman , and Esperanza Muñoz , a struggling female boxer who becomes his personal assistant . During its broadcast its overall rating averaged 26 @.@ 9 points . It was critically acclaimed , and won four Martín Fierro Awards and three Clarín Awards . It was sold to more than 40 countries and had remakes in Mexico , Poland and Portugal . 
 = = Premise = = 
 The telenovela was produced by Pol @-@ ka based on a premise by Adrián <unk> , which he formulated nearly six months before the show 's premiere , after discussion with his partner Javier Blanco y <unk> . The premise involves a rich businessman and former Formula 1 racing driver who falls in love with a poor woman looking for work in his emporium . <unk> requested scripts from Ernesto <unk> and Sebastian <unk> , the authors of <unk> and El <unk> de mi vida , and Hombres de honor and Padre <unk> respectively . The program was directed by Daniel De <unk> and Rodolfo Antúnez and produced by César Markus González . Most of the filming was done in the Pol @-@ ka studio at the <unk> neighborhood , using outdoor scenes unconventional for the genre . 
 The telenovela features Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro , who both appeared in the successful telenovela Muñeca Brava , as lead actors . The relationship between the two was more than professional ; Facundo Arana had spontaneously been offered a guest appearance on the Russian series A <unk> de tango starring Oreiro . Both actors agreed to appear in You Are the One on the condition that they worked together . As a result , the program design was decided only after both were confirmed in the leading roles . Oreiro delayed filming proposals in Israel , Spain , and Uruguay , and the recording of her fourth music album to join the project . As in Muñeca Brava , the narrative of You Are the One revolves around a wealthy suitor and a poor woman , but unlike the former program it does not concentrate all the characters on a single narrative context . You Are the One organizes two contexts for both the rich and the poor , each one with its own characteristic locations and supporting characters . 
 Natalia Oreiro plays Esperanza Muñoz , a female boxer nicknamed " La Monita " . Oreiro was inspired by the singer Gilda to outline the character 's personality . The main location is a tenement in the neighborhood of La Boca where Esperanza lives with other characters . Her adoptive mother Nieves lives with Enrique " Quique " <unk> , her natural son and Esperanza 's childhood boyfriend . The writers drafted Quique 's general outlines ; Belloso defined most of his personality , including the relationship with Esperanza — which is halfway between engagement and brotherhood — and his Oedipus complex with his mother . Esperanza trains as a boxer in a neighbourhood gymnasium with Quique , who has a wrestling gimmick as " Commander Ray " . Other main characters in the series are actress <unk> <unk> , known as " The Turk " , and Paraguayan janitor Kimberly . 
 The character of Martín Quesada establishes a context of wealthy characters . Quesada is a businessman and Formula 1 driver , but is not presented as selfish or greedy as is the archetype of entrepreneurs in soap operas . The two locations associated with him are the Quesada Group office , presided over by him , and his home . The office has the characters of Quesada 's chief adviser Alfredo Uribe , the secretary Mercedes , and his cousin Miguel Quesada , who serves as vice @-@ president , and the lawyer Felix Perez Garmendia . His girlfriend Constanza <unk> and his cousin Debbie are also included . Martín lives with his housekeeper Rosa , Rosa 's grandson Tony , and three adopted orphan siblings , José , Laura , and <unk> . Another recurring site is the apartment of Miguel and Debbie , which would be also used as the house of Constanza or Garmendia if needed . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The story begins during a boxing match of Esperanza Muñoz — nicknamed " Monita " — who has sustained a hand injury . Her manager , Enrique " Quique " <unk> , is pressuring her to continue fighting , despite her pain . This injury complicates her economic situation , as her boxing provides the only income for her adoptive family , namely Quique and his mother , Maria de las Nieves . Nieves loves Esperanza like her own daughter , and pressures her to marry Quique . Her neighbor Kimberly suggests that Esperanza apply for a job in the Quesada Group , where she works as a <unk> . The secretary Mercedes rejects Esperanza due to her violent manners and her dressing style . Martín Quesada , the president of the company , sees Esperanza crying in the street and hires her as his personal assistant . 
 Martín also meets three orphan siblings , José , Laura , and <unk> , who resisted being adopted by different families . He takes them to his home , and starts the legal proceedings to adopt them . Martín begins to like Esperanza , but his girlfriend Constanza , a cold , manipulative , and malicious woman , is wary of her . Esperanza does not tell Martín about her relations with Quique , instead pretending to be his sister . She also does not tell Martín that she is a boxer . Quique and Constanza begin their own relationship , unknown by most other characters . Martín breaks off his relationship with Esperanza when he sees her goodbye kiss with Quique , as he realizes that she was lying to him . 
 After the breakup with Esperanza , Martín resumes his romance with Constanza and eventually proposes marriage to her , in order to improve his chances of winning custody of the three siblings . The judge , who thought that Esperanza was a bad influence on the children , gives the adoption to Constanza instead of Martín , forcing him to marry her . Their marriage proves difficult ; Constanza is demanding and possessive , and despises the adopted siblings , who hate her as well . Martín finally breaks with Constanza when she pretends to be blind to keep him with her . The children 's custody battle delays the divorce , as Martín wants to keep them . 
 Due to the efforts of Martín 's cousin Miguel , the unscrupulous lawyer " <unk> " , and Constanza , Martin gradually loses his fortune , his business , and his house . He moves to the <unk> and works as a taxi driver . Eventually , he recovers everything . A new character , Bárbara , temporarily joins the love triangle of Martín , Esperanza , and Constanza . Constanza gets pregnant by Quique and tries to pass off her son as Martín 's , but fails . Martín finally marries Esperanza and has a family with her and the adopted children . Constanza moves in with Quique . 
 = = Production = = 
 The program was directed by Daniel De <unk> and Rodolfo Antúnez , and produced by César Markus González . Most of the filming occurred at the headquarters of Pol @-@ ka in the <unk> neighborhood . The telenovela took several risks in the creative and production fields , which were mostly successful . The choice of Martín Quesada 's background as a Formula 1 driver required an area with a large infrastructure to represent realistic races . For realism , plot scenes set outside Buenos Aires were actually filmed outside the city . There was significant press coverage during the location shooting in Germany , which took place during the 2006 FIFA World Cup . Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro played their characters in the <unk> @-@ Arena stadium during the Argentina @-@ Serbia and Montenegro match . The result of the match — a 6 – 0 Argentine victory — benefited the filming , and the episode received 31 @.@ 5 rating points . Location shooting also occurred in the tourist ski resort Las <unk> in the Andes . A simulated aircraft crash that left the characters in a jungle was filmed at the Pereyra Iraola park and an Argentine Air Force park in Morón . 
 To make her performances as a female boxer look realistic , Oreiro trained regularly with the renowned boxer Marcela Acuña and her coach Ramón <unk> . They taught Oreiro how to stand and move in the ring and how to make various types of strokes , and she underwent cardiovascular and weight training . Acuña commented that Oreiro mastered the basic techniques more quickly than most beginner boxers . For this training , Oreiro temporarily gave up her vegetarian diet . Another plot required the characters to fly a Piper Tomahawk airplane and make an emergency landing . This was risky filming , and Arana and Oreiro did not use stunt doubles for it . The scene , which was the first of its kind in a daily Argentine telenovela , required four professional pilots , five special effects experts , and two additional aircraft used for filming the main aircraft from the outside . Arana was advised by the pilot Alberto Di Giorgio . 
 The program 's opening theme is Gilda 's " Corazón Valiente " ( Spanish : Braveheart ) , sung by Oreiro . It was produced by <unk> Gimenez , widower and producer of the late Gilda . Oreiro is a fan of Gilda and chose this song as a homage to mark the 10th anniversary of her death . She considered including it in her next music CD , but did not record anything afterwards . 
 = = = Guest actors = = = 
 The program featured several guest stars , who appeared in secondary or support roles in several episodes . Some guest stars — such as the singers Chayanne , Ricky Martin and Julieta Venegas — played themselves within the fiction of the program . Venegas ' song " Tu Nombre " is used as a background song in romantic settings . Marcela Acuña appeared twice , playing herself in a match against Oreiro 's character . The appearance of actress Leticia <unk> was nominated for the " best cameo in fiction " category at the Martín Fierro Awards ; the prize was given to Nora <unk> . Actress Reina <unk> delayed other projects to take part in the program . 
 = = = Narration = = = 
 The program expanded the usual conventions of the genre by using several types of metafiction , referencing the actors themselves or the nature of the program . An example within the plot is Sos mi <unk> , a program within the program whose characters were based on the show 's main characters . The actors ' former characters are occasionally referenced in plots that place them in similar contexts than those of older fictions . Martín infiltrated a convent using a habit similar to the one Arana 's character in Padre <unk> wore , and Esperanza wore clothes similar to those Oreiro 's character in Muñeca Brava wore when they had to get into a slum . 
 Many actors played minor characters as well as their main roles . Pablo <unk> played a Paraguayan brother of his character <unk> ; both characters were involved in a love triangle with Kimberly . Carlos Belloso was cast as Quique 's lost sister , dressed as a woman . Natalia Oreiro , who speaks Russian fluently , took the role of a Russian princess . Facundo Arana played a criminal , a role unlike Martín . Those scenes did not use special effects ; each character was filmed separately without the two characters sharing the screen . The hero of the telenovela marries the villain , contrary to the genre 's usual convention in which such a wedding is interrupted or canceled at the last moment .

 The program was first broadcast in January , a month of low television activity in Argentina because of the summer vacations . Nevertheless , it was highly successful . The competitor channel Telefe aired the teen comedy Alma Pirata , which was rescheduled because of its low ratings , and replaced it with the second season of Casados con Hijos . Both programs had similar ratings until the end of Casados con Hijos in August . With an average rating of 26 @.@ 8 points , Sos mi vida ended as the most watched Argentine television fiction so far ; it was displaced by the 2009 telenovela <unk> , which received 27 @.@ 3 rating points . 
 = = = Awards = = = 
 The program was awarded the best TV comedy at the 2006 ceremony of the Martín Fierro Awards , prevailing over Casados con hijos and ¿ Quién es el Jefe ? . Facundo Arana received the award for best lead actor in comedy , prevailing over Guillermo <unk> , Humberto Tortonese , and Nicolás Vázquez . Natalia Oreiro won the award for the best lead actress in comedy , prevailing over Florencia Peña , Nancy <unk> , Carmen Barbieri , and Andrea Bonelli . Alejandro <unk> , Marcelo <unk> , and Carlos Belloso received nominations for supporting comedy actor awards , which was won by Belloso . Similarly , three of five nominations for supporting comedy actress went to Carla Peterson , Mónica <unk> and Claudia Fontán , but the award went to Érika Rivas of Casados con hijos . The program was unsuccessfully nominated for best theme song and best guest appearance for Leticia <unk> . 
 Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro were nominated again at the 2007 Martín Fierro Awards . These nominations proved controversial because the program only lasted for a week in 2007 and had no second season , and both actors took a recess from work after it . Neither of them received an award for those nominations . Oreiro won the newly created award for the best dressed actress of the night , which is not part of the official awards . 
 At the Clarín Awards ceremony in late 2006 , the program was awarded for the best comedy , prevailing over Casados con hijos and Alma Pirata . Elías <unk> won the award for best actor , Ornella Fazio was nominated for best female actor ; the award was given to María Abadi of Montecristo . Unlike the Martín Fierro , the Clarín awards do not distinguish between lead and supporting actors . Belloso was awarded as best comedy actor ; Oreiro was nominated and the award was given to Érika Rivas . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The Clarín newspaper attributes the success of the program to the actors ' performances , the subplots , production initiatives , and the original treatment of stories . The work of the supporting cast was also praised , including Carla Peterson , <unk> Garcia Lago , and Marcelo <unk> . The newspaper La Nación praised the show 's mix of sitcom humor and telenovela drama , and equated the dramatic episodes to the works of renowned telenovela authors Abel Santa Cruz , Alberto <unk> , and Delia <unk> . 
 The program was criticized for the length of time — nearly three months — before the lead couple 's first kiss . Clarín also criticized a badly @-@ performed striptease act by Facundo Arana . As Carlos Belloso could not go with Arana and Oreiro to the filming at the World Cup , he was filmed in the Plaza San Martín , pretending that he was in Germany as well . 
 The program 's scheduled broadcast time was 21 : 00 , but the channel often delayed its broadcast by up to 40 minutes . This led to conflicts with other channels and <unk> , the institution that regulates Argentine television . The last episode lasted for half an hour and was followed by the premiere of the new telenovela Son de Fierro ; La Nación said that the final episode should have lasted a full hour .

 The program was initially aired in Argentina in 2006 on El Trece at prime time . Following the success of the initial run , El Trece and Volver reran the show . It is sold internationally by the Dori Media Group under the English name " You Are The One " to more than 40 countries . 
 The concept of the program was sold as well , and some countries remade the telenovela with local actors . The Mexican version , Un <unk> al corazón , starred Danna Garcia , Sebastián <unk> , <unk> Wilkins , and Raul <unk> . The characters were renamed , but Garcia 's character retained the sobriquet " La Monita " . The Polish version , <unk> w <unk> , starred Anna Mucha , Filip <unk> , and Małgorzata Socha . The Portuguese version , <unk> @-@ me <unk> , starred Paulo Pires and Paula Lobo Antunes .

 Devourment is an American death metal band from Dallas , Texas . Formed in 1995 , the band has split up and reformed three times and Brad Fincher is the only original member . The current lineup is Ruben Rosas , Chris Andrews , Dave Spencer and Brad Fincher . The band is currently signed to Relapse Records , and was previously signed to Brutal Bands , United Guttural and Corpse Gristle Records . Devourment has also had albums re @-@ released by other labels . 
 Since the band 's foundation , Devourment released a demo , Impaled , and an album , Molesting the Decapitated , before disbanding due to the jailing of vocalist Ruben Rosas . There was a brief reformation of the band during his incarceration , which saw the initial release of the compilation album 1 @.@ 3 @.@ 8 . , and a brief reformation upon his release in 2002 . The band reformed for a third time in 2005 , and has since released two reissues of 1 @.@ 3 @.@ 8 . , two DVDs , and three full @-@ length albums : Butcher the Weak , Unleash the Carnivore , and Conceived in Sewage . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Formation and early history ( 1995 – 1999 ) = = = 
 Devourment was formed in 1995 following the breakup of Dallas death metal band <unk> . <unk> 's drummer , Brad Fincher , and guitarist , Braxton Henry , met up with former <unk> vocalist Wayne Knupp to play brutal death metal . However , the newly formed band achieved little — Knupp moved back to his hometown of Chicago , and Fincher moved to San Antonio for educational reasons . Months later , when the two of them had moved back to Dallas , Henry had formed his own band — Dead Industry . Knupp got in contact with someone he had known years earlier , Brian " Brain " Wynn , and they reformed the band . This lineup is often cited as the " original " . The band then developed its first promo , featuring two songs , " Shroud of Encryption " and " <unk> <unk> Mass " , which was produced by former and future guitarist Braxton Henry . 
 Over the next few months , Kevin Clark ( formerly of <unk> ) joined the band as a secondary guitarist , and Mike Majewski joined on bass . Majewski had previously worked publicizing the band and providing artwork . He had first seen Devourment when the band 's only song was " Shroud of Encryption " . The band recorded " <unk> on Bile " which they added to their original demo . This was released in 1997 by Corpse Gristle Records under the name of Impaled . Knupp later left the band " due to some internal problems " . He was replaced by Ruben Rosas , who played guitars and provided vocals in a local band called <unk> . 
 = = = Molesting the Decapitated ( 1999 – 2002 ) = = = 
 In 1999 , Devourment signed a record deal with United Guttural and started developing its first album , Molesting the Decapitated , again produced by Braxton . The album was released later that year . Reviews were positive , with Blas , of Global Domination , who praised the album for being so brutal , claiming that " if you look up the word ' Brutal ' in the dictionary right now , you 'd see Devourment 's logo right next to the definition " . He praised the vocals , but said that the drums , in places , let the album down due to them being too fast . Dan <unk> , of Metal Review , said that the instruments were " remarkably balanced and crisp " , and his only criticism was that the " ultra heavy breakdowns " " may sound a little monotonous " , but that " you will still bang your head " . 
 The band had a release show for the album in Colorado . Although Majewski claimed that this was in 1998 , the album was apparently released in 1999 , so he was probably mistaken . This show was alongside Macabre and Cephalic Carnage , among others . Shortly afterwards , Rosas was arrested and jailed for two and a half years , meaning the members of the band went their separate ways . Rosas 's arrest was described by Majewski as the " last straw " , as the band was becoming more and more business @-@ like , with Wynn and his wife arranging concerts without consulting the rest of the band . 
 Devourment reformed during Rosas 's incarceration , with Knupp taking Rosas 's place on vocals , and Braxton Henry rejoining the band in the place of Brian Wynn . The band recorded a single song , named " <unk> " , which was featured on a compilation album named Southern Uprising . The song was also featured on the band 's own compilation album , 1 @.@ 3 @.@ 8 . , the title of which represents the one song , " <unk> " , with the three songs from Impaled , and the eight songs from Molesting the Decapitated . The compilation was released four times — once on Corpse Gristle Records while Rosas was in jail , once on Unmatched Brutality in 2004 , once after Rosas 's release while the band was working on new material , including the band 's first DVD , on Displeased Records , and finally as a limited edition record by the label Night of the Vinyl Dead . Upon Rosas 's release in 2002 , he reformed the band with new members , featuring himself on vocals , guitarists Robert Moore and Kevin Clark , Jeremy Peterson on drums and Joseph Fontenot ( later of Jacknife ) on bass . Clark was then replaced by Chris Hutto of <unk> . Rosas 's new lineup played a few shows , but then split up again . Majewski later referred to the time between the band 's two full @-@ length albums , explaining that " Ruben and I both made attempts to get the band going again but both failed " . 
 = = = Butcher the Weak ( 2005 – 2007 ) = = = 
 A few years later , Knupp , Rosas , and Majewski finally properly reformed Devourment . Eric Park , formerly of Suture , filled out the lineup which would record the second Devourment album . The band entered the studio in August 2005 to begin recording Butcher the Weak , and the completed album was released in November 2005 . For this album , Majewski performed vocals , Rosas provided guitars and bass , and Park was on drums . According to Josh Thorne of fourteen g , the " production is a lot better " than it was on Molesting the Decapitated , but Majewski explained that both albums had been recorded in the same studio . The album contained artwork by Majewski , who works for a special effects company . 
 Felix <unk> of Vampire Magazine said it was odd that the album was self @-@ released by the band , asking , " why should a band like Devourment release their own album ... every week countless useless releases are thrown on the market by bands that nobody will ever care for and Devourment is somehow forced to release its own album . " In 2006 , the band signed a two album deal with label Brutal Bands , and proceeded to re @-@ record and re @-@ release Butcher the Weak . The new release 's cover was yellow , while the self @-@ released version sported a green cover , though they bore the same design . 
 On September 15 , 2007 , Wayne Knupp died of multiple organ failure due to alcohol abuse . Despite no longer being with Devourment , his links with the band were widely reported , including his guest appearance with Devourment at the Central Illinois Metalfest earlier in the year . Knupp 's girlfriend posted a message on his Myspace profile confirming his death and thanking people for their support and messages . In an interview with <unk> , Majewski spoke of the impact of the death on the band , saying , 
 It had a big impact . He was a founding member and really created the vocal style we are known for . Just felt like part of the band died too . Like when he died , it was just weird to think about doing shows or recording without him around , even if he was no longer in the band . He was a good person and definitely deserves to be remembered . 
 Since Butcher the Weak , Devourment recorded new material for compilation albums and continued to tour . The band appeared at various festivals , including Central Illinois Metalfest , The <unk> 's Ball and Germany 's Fuck the Commerce . Devourment also released its second DVD in January 2007 . In an interview with <unk> in October 2007 , Majewski said that the band aimed to complete a third studio album by mid @-@ 2008 , performing less in 2008 . 
 = = = Unleash the Carnivore ( 2009 – 2010 ) = = = 
 Devourment 's third full @-@ length studio album , Unleash the Carnivore , was released in 2009 through Brutal Bands . The cover features artwork by acclaimed death metal artists Dan Seagrave and Pär Olofsson . Unleash the Carnivore was followed in 2010 with the " Unleash the Carnivore tour " . On July 14 , 2010 , Devourment announced that the band had signed with Relapse . 
 = = = Conceived in Sewage ( 2011 – present ) = = = 
 Devourment began writing new material in 2011 , and travelled to St. Petersburg , Florida in June 2012 to record its fourth album . In January 2013 , Devourment released a single for the song " Fifty Ton War Machine " . The new album , titled Conceived in Sewage , was recorded with Erik Rutan , and was released on February 19 , 2013 . 
 The band intended to play a 2013 fall US tour headlined by Dying Fetus and supported by Exhumed , Waking the Cadaver and Abiotic , but dropped off the tour roughly three months in advance . This caused speculation that the band had broken up or would be breaking up due to it being Devourment 's second planned line of concert appearances that year that went abandoned . The rumors that the band had broke up were later dispelled by Majewski , with the statement , " Just to squash rumors , Your ol pals Devo are not broken up ! " 
 On May 19 , 2014 , Devourment announced that vocalist Mike Majewski and drummer Eric Park quit the band . Ruben Rosas moved from his position from guitar to vocals while bassist Chris Andrews moved to playing guitar . Brad Fincher ( who quit Devourment in 2001 ) rejoined the band on drums , and <unk> bass player Dave Spencer joined on bass .

 = James Walker ( Royal Navy officer ) = 
 James Walker CB , <unk> ( 1764 – 13 July 1831 ) was an officer of the Royal Navy . He served during the American War of Independence , and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars , rising to the rank of Rear @-@ Admiral . 
 Walker spent his early years in the navy at first in British waters during the invasion scares of 1779 , and then in North American waters where he saw action at most of the decisive naval battles of the war , particularly at the Chesapeake , St. Kitts and the Saintes . He reached the rank of lieutenant before the end of hostilities and spent the interwar years travelling on the continent . Returning to service with the outbreak of war with the French , he again participated in many of the key naval actions of the period , with his service at the Glorious First of June securing his promotion to his own commands . His career was almost ended with an accusation of disobeying orders , which led to his dismissal from the navy , but he was reinstated in time to develop a plan to subdue the mutinies at Spithead and the Nore . He commanded a ship at the Battle of Camperdown , and another at the Battle of Copenhagen , earning Nelson 's praise for his actions . 
 The early part of the Napoleonic Wars were spent in the Caribbean , where Walker played an important role in the Haitian Revolution , and took the surrender of a French garrison . After time spent escorting convoys , Walker joined the ships covering the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil , and struck up a friendship with the Prince Regent . His association with royalty continued with his services in transporting the Duke of Clarence , Tsar Alexander I of Russia and King Frederick William III of Prussia , and he was duly invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath and a Knight of the Order of the Tower and Sword . His later years were spent managing a fleet off the American coast during the War of 1812 , and he commanded several ships after the end of the wars , retiring with the rank of rear @-@ admiral . 
 = = Family and early life = = 
 James Walker was born in 1764 , the son of James Walker of <unk> , Fife and his wife the novelist , Mary Leslie , the third daughter of Alexander Melville , 5th Earl of Leven . He entered the navy as a midshipman aboard the 32 @-@ gun HMS Southampton on 18 December 1776 , serving under Captain William Garnier . He went out to Jamaica in January 1777 , but returned to British waters for service in the North Sea and then the English Channel with Sir Charles Hardy 's fleet during the invasion crisis in 1779 . While serving in the Channel in 1780 , Southampton captured an 18 @-@ gun French privateer off Portland , with 80 men aboard her . Walker was sent to assist in removing the prisoners , and after doing so remained on board to help with the baling and pumping , as the privateer was in danger of sinking . Despite his efforts the privateer suddenly sank , nearly taking Walker down with her . He was in the water for ten minutes before being rescued . 
 William Garnier was succeeded by Philip Affleck in command of Southampton in August , and the ship returned to Jamaica . Walker continued to serve on her until June 1781 , when he was transferred to the 98 @-@ gun HMS Princess Royal , the flagship of Rear @-@ Admiral Joshua Rowley . Walker was appointed to act as lieutenant on 18 June 1781 and was assigned to HMS Torbay , part of Sir Samuel Hood 's squadron despatched to North America . Under Hood Walker saw action at the Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September 1781 , the Battle of St. Kitts on 26 July 1782 , and the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April 1782 . During the Battle of the Saintes Torbay had ten men killed and 25 wounded . Walker was then on the verge of being promoted again , due to the intimate friendship between his father and Admiral Sir George Rodney , but before this could be carried out Rodney was superseded by Admiral Hugh Pigot , and Walker remained at his previous rank . He continued on aboard Torbay , and was present at the Action of 18 October 1782 , when Torbay and HMS London encountered the French 74 @-@ gun Scipion . The British ships chased her into Samana Bay , Haiti , where she ran aground and was wrecked . Walker received his lieutenant 's commission on 8 May 1783 . 
 = = Years of peace = = 
 After the end of the American War of Independence in 1783 Walker visited the continent , touring through France , Germany and Italy . While in Vienna in 1787 , news reached him of political troubles with the Dutch , and he began to journey back to England in hope of a commission . While travelling through the forest near Aschaffenburg , the diligence he was in was attacked by ten armed men , who fired into the coach and demanded the passengers ' money . Walker attempted to resist them , but was left unsupported by his fellow passengers , and was knocked down , robbed , and thrown into a ditch . The robbers took <unk> of money and rode off , believing Walker to be dead . He came to , suffering from a sabre cut to the head , and was carried into Aschaffenburg . There his wounds were treated free of charge by the local surgeons and authorities , and on recovering sufficiently he was brought to Frankfurt . There the local lodge of freemasons offered him financial assistance , and on his arrival at Mainz he was presented to the Prince @-@ Bishop , Friedrich Karl Joseph von <unk> . The Archbishop gave him a letter detailing his adventure in the forest near Aschaffenburg , and commending his bravery . Despite this assistance Walker was unable to reach England until after the Dutch crisis had abated , and so returned to his travels in Germany . 
 The outbreak of the Russo @-@ Turkish War created a new opportunity for Walker , when in 1788 the Russians offered him command of a ship . The Admiralty refused to grant him permission to accept however , and Walker was obliged to turn it down . Despite this , Walker returned to service in the Royal Navy in 1789 , with an appointment on 11 September to the 24 @-@ gun HMS Champion , based at Leith under Captain Sampson Edwards . He transferred to the 32 @-@ gun HMS Winchelsea on 24 January 1790 , serving in the English Channel under Captain Richard Fisher . He left the ship in February 1792 and spent nearly a year at home . He was back on active service from 2 December with an appointment to the 98 @-@ gun HMS Boyne , intended as the flagship of Walker 's old commander , now Rear @-@ Admiral Philip Affleck . Boyne escorted a convoy of ships of the East India Company to the Tropic of Capricorn , and Walker remained with her until shortly after the outbreak of war with Revolutionary France . On 24 June 1793 he transferred to the 32 @-@ gun HMS Niger , which was then under Captain the Honourable Arthur Kaye Legge , as first @-@ lieutenant .

 Niger was attached to the Channel Fleet , and took part of the Atlantic campaign of May 1794 with Lord Howe . She was one of the repeating ships at the Glorious First of June , though she did not take part in the fighting herself . Walker 's role as signal lieutenant secured him promotion to commander on 6 July 1794 . He went as a volunteer with Legge to HMS Latona , had a stint as acting commander of HMS Gibraltar and in April 1795 he was in temporary command of the bomb vessel HMS Terror . He received an appointment on 15 July 1795 to the temporary command of the 50 @-@ gun HMS Trusty , and was ordered to escort five East Indiamen to a safe latitude , and then to return to Spithead . Having escorted the merchants to the designated point he received news that a fleet of 36 English merchants were assembled at Cadiz , in need of an escort . 
 = = = Dismissal and reinstatement = = = 
 Disobeying his orders to return to Spithead , Walker made for Cadiz , gathered the convoy , and escorted them to Britain . It was a controversial action . The merchants claimed the cargoes were worth £ 1 million , and would have been at considerable risk from enemy vessels were it not for Walker 's escort . However the Spanish authorities were greatly incensed , arresting five of Trusty 's officers while she was at Cadiz on charges of having smuggled the merchant 's money out of the port , and demanding Walker be court @-@ martialled . Walker justified himself by pointing to the imminent alliance between France and Spain , but despite the Lords of the Admiralty being sympathetic to his cause , he was found guilty of disobeying orders , and was dismissed from the navy . The Lords advised him to join the fleet despatched to the West Indies under Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian , but it was dispersed by gales and the ship Walker was travelling on returned to port . There it was suggested that he wait in Britain , and with the Spanish declaration of war , Walker was reinstated on the navy list in March 1797 by an order in council . 
 = = = Mutiny and Camperdown = = = 
 Shortly afterwards mutiny broke out at Spithead and at the Nore . Walker proposed an attack on the mutinous ships at the Nore using heavily armed gunboats , fitted with carronades , and was commissioned by the Admiralty on 10 June to carry this out . Walker set out down the Thames but only got as far as Gravesend before news reached him that the mutineers had submitted and his operation was no longer necessary . He was appointed acting @-@ captain of HMS Garland on 16 July 1797 and conveyed a Baltic @-@ bound convoy of merchants as far as Elsinore . 
 On his return he was appointed captain of the 64 @-@ gun HMS Monmouth on 20 August , still in an acting capacity . Monmouth had been one of the most mutinous ships of the whole fleet , and was heavily involved in the Nore mutiny . Walker took her to join Admiral Adam Duncan 's fleet in the North Sea . Within a short time he was able to restore good order aboard her , and was able to play a significant role in the Battle of Camperdown on 11 October . As she approached the Dutch fleet Walker gathered the crew and addressed them saying ' My lads , you see your enemy ; I shall lay you close aboard and give you an opportunity of washing the stain off your characters in the blood of your foes . Now , go to your quarters and do your duty . ' During the battle Monmouth engaged the Dutch ships Delft and Alkmaar for an hour and a half , forcing both of them to surrender . Monmouth , which had lost five men killed and 22 wounded , took Alkmaar in tow , and despite sailing through a strong gale , reached the shelter of Yarmouth roads five days later . The battle was a decisive victory for the British over the Dutch , and Walker was among those captains rewarded , having his post rank confirmed on 17 October , and receiving the Naval Gold Medal and the thanks of parliament . He attended the service of thanksgiving at St Paul 's Cathedral on 19 December , and assisted in depositing the captured enemy colours .

 Walker took command of the 64 @-@ gun HMS Veteran on 8 February 1798 , before transferring in quick succession to the 56 @-@ gun HMS <unk> , the 98 @-@ gun HMS Prince George , the 90 @-@ gun HMS Prince and lastly the 50 @-@ gun HMS Isis on 7 October 1800 . He commanded Isis in the North Sea , the Skagerrak and in the Baltic Sea , as well as with the Channel Fleet . Isis was assigned to the Baltic expedition under Admiral Sir Hyde Parker , and joined Rear @-@ Admiral Horatio Nelson 's squadron for the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801 . The plan of attack had to be improvised at the last minute , after several ships ran aground while trying to enter the harbour , including Nelson 's flagship , HMS Elephant . Walker took Isis in to engage both his own target as well as Elephant 's , and ended up fighting two Danish blockships and a 14 @-@ gun battery . When eventually Nelson was able to work his way down the line he left Walker at his task and took another position . As he passed , Nelson took off his hat , waved it , and cried , ' Well done , brave Walker ! Go on as you have begun ; nothing can be better ' . After four and a half hours of intense fighting Isis silenced her opponents , at the heavy cost of nine officers and 103 men killed or wounded . Nelson came aboard Isis the following morning and thanked Walker and his men for their brave efforts .

 Walker received an appointment to command the new 32 @-@ gun HMS Tartar on 1 July 1801 and took a convoy of merchants to Jamaica . He continued to be employed , despite the drawdown of the navy following the Peace of Amiens , and received command of the 74 @-@ gun HMS Vanguard on 27 January 1802 . With the resumption of hostilities in 1803 he was assigned to the Blockade of Saint @-@ Domingue , and captured the 44 @-@ gun French frigate Créole , bound for Port au Prince with 530 troops under General Morgan . On 25 July he captured the French 74 @-@ gun Duquesne . After taking his prize to Jamaica Walker returned to his station and on 1 October demanded the surrender of the French garrison at Saint @-@ Marc . The garrison of 1100 men was besieged by the forces of generals Jean @-@ Jacques Dessalines and Henri Christophe , and were short of food . They agreed to surrender to Walker and were taken off in order to save them from the vengeance of the besieging forces . In doing so he saved their lives , but as his provisions were rapidly exhausted he was forced to return to port to resupply at the point at which Cape François was about to fall , and so missed out on a considerable sum of prize money . 
 = = = Convoys = = = 
 Walker was then given command of his prize , the Duquesne , on 2 March 1804 , and sailed her from Jamaica to Chatham with only 160 men . Also embarked on the Duquesne were an almost equal number of French prisoners , which had to be closely watched during the passage , in case they made an attempt to take the ship . Duquesne arrived in England without incident , and Walker paid her off for repairs . He then received command of the 36 @-@ gun HMS Thalia on 1 March 1805 and escorted convoys to the East Indies and Quebec . The voyage to the East Indies was made with two ships laden with treasure was made safely and quickly , with Walker arriving back at Spithead ten months to the day of his departure . The voyage to Quebec was made in company with two frigates , which delivered the convoy , but were delayed in port by gales until 1 December 1806 . After setting sail Thalia became caught in a gale off the Newfoundland Banks and ran for 1250 miles for five days under bare poles . After returning to Spithead Walker was assigned to the Guernsey station under Sir Edmund Nagle , where he was given command of a squadron of three frigates and a brig to watch the enemy at St Malo . 
 = = = Portuguese service = = = 
 In October 1807 Walker was transferred to the 74 @-@ gun HMS Bedford and was sent to Lisbon with Sir Sidney Smith . While there the decision was made to evacuate the Portuguese Royal Family to Brazil , just prior to the capture of the Portuguese capital , Lisbon , by Napoleonic forces . HMS Bedford joined HMS Monarch , HMS London and HMS Marlborough as an escort for the Portuguese ships , with the British squadron being commanded by Commodore Graham Moore . The fleet was dispersed by heavy gales off Madeira , though Bedford was able to rejoin the ships carrying the royals two days later , and was the only British ship to escort them for the rest of the thirteen week voyage . Walker struck up a friendship with the Prince Regent , who wanted to create him a member of the Order of Aviz , but owing to Walker 's religion , he instead recreated the military Order of the Tower and Sword . The Prince Regent invested himself with the honour , and then immediately created Walker a Knight Commander of the order on 30 April 1816 , making him the senior Knight Commander of the order . Walker spent two years with the court at Rio de Janeiro , and in addition to the honour , received the Prince Regent 's portrait set in brilliants , a valuable diamond ring , and several letters testifying to Walker 's good service .

 On Walker 's return to Britain he asked for , and received , orders to join the fleet in the North Sea . Still in command of Bedford , he took part in the blockade of Flushing under Admiral John Ferrier , narrowly avoiding being wrecked in a gale on 14 January 1814 . After being repaired she joined Admiral William Young , and then Admiral Scott to go into Flushing . In the summer of 1814 Walker was selected to accompany the Duke of Clarence on his journey to Boulogne to collect Tsar Alexander I of Russia and King Frederick William III of Prussia . Bedford then formed part of the fleet assembled for a Royal review . He then made two trips to bring army units back from the continent . In September 1814 he took command of a squadron carrying the advance guard of an invasion force to occupy New Orleans under Major @-@ General John Keane . During the campaign the senior naval officers , Sir Alexander Cochrane and Rear @-@ Admirals Pulteney Malcolm and Edward Codrington , went ashore , leaving Walker to manage the fleet , which owing to the shoal water , had to be kept a hundred miles offshore . 
 = = Later years = = 
 Walker continued to receive employment despite the end of the wars with France and America , commanding in turn the 74 @-@ gun ships HMS Albion , HMS Queen and HMS Northumberland , paying off Northumberland on 10 September 1818 . He was nominated a Companion of the Bath on 4 June 1815 , and was promoted to rear @-@ admiral on 19 July 1821 . Walker was reportedly a cheerful and friendly officer , who won respect through his leniency and good nature . His commanding officer , William Young , once complimented him for keeping Bedford in a state of high discipline without once resorting to a flogging over a period of five months and three weeks . While in command of the Northumberland he was praised for his actions when he and his crew fought a fire that had broken out in Sheerness Dockyard , and which had threatened to destroy the entire yard . James Walker was twice married , at first to a daughter of General Sir John Irwin , Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , Ireland . The marriage did not produce any children and after her death Walker married Priscilla Sarah , the fourth daughter of the MP <unk> Jones @-@ Skelton . The couple had three sons ; the eldest , Melville , entered the army , while the two younger sons , Leven Charles Frederick and Thomas , followed their father into the navy . Rear @-@ Admiral James Walker died at Blatchington , near Seaford , Sussex on 13 July 1831 at the age of 67 , after a short illness . 
 = As I Lay Dying ( band ) = 
 As I Lay Dying is an American metalcore band from San Diego , California . Founded in 2000 by vocalist Tim Lambesis , the establishment of the band 's first full lineup , which included drummer Jordan Mancino , occurred in 2001 . As I Lay Dying has released six albums , one split album , and two compilation albums . 
 As I Lay Dying 's fourth studio album An Ocean Between Us peaked at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 , and No. 1 on the Top Rock chart . The band has performed at events such as Wacken Open Air , With Full Force , Soundwave Festival , Sounds of the Underground , Warped Tour , Bloodstock Open Air and Taste of Chaos . In 2007 , As I Lay Dying won the " Ultimate Metal God " award from MTV2 at the first annual " All That Rocks " special ; was named " Artist of the Year " at the San Diego Music Awards in 2005 , 2007 and 2008 ; and was nominated for a 2008 Grammy Award for the song " Nothing Left . " Their fifth studio album The Powerless Rise was written over a three @-@ year period , and was released in May 2010 to widespread critical acclaim . Their most recent album , Awakened , was released on September 25 , 2012 . 
 The band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2014 when Lambesis was incarcerated and sentenced to six years in prison . The remaining members formed <unk> with Oh , Sleeper vocalist and guitarist Shane Blay .

 = = = Formation and first releases ( 2000 – 04 ) = = = 
 After leaving the band Society 's Finest , in which he played guitar , vocalist Lambesis formed As I Lay Dying in 2000 . Starting out as a duet with drummer Mancino , they first met as a band in February 2001 . They both were in the hardcore punk band Point of Recognition . The band 's name came from the novel of the same name by William Faulkner that was published in 1930 ; although the band 's lyrics and music are not directly inspired by the novel . 
 Shortly after the band 's formation , Pluto Records offered As I Lay Dying a recording contract and , after accepting the offer , the band entered the studio one month later to record their first album Beneath the Encasing of Ashes , released in June 2001 . The band then recorded five songs for a split album , again through Pluto Records , with San Diego post @-@ hardcore band American Tragedy . 
 As I Lay Dying realized it needed to expand to a five @-@ piece band to include another guitarist and a bassist . Mancino commented " we started going on tour and we needed obviously more people than that . " As Lambesis and Mancino were the only permanent members , the band recruited friends to perform with them and subsequently underwent several lineup changes : bassist Noah Chase departed in 2001 , while Brandon Hays , and his subsequent replacement Aaron Kennedy , departed in 2003 . During early 2003 , when As I Lay Dying 's Pluto Records contract expired , the band pursued deals with other record labels . After extensive touring and an increase in popularity , As I Lay Dying was offered a record deal with Metal Blade Records in March 2003 . 
 In July 2003 , the band 's second studio album Frail Words Collapse was released . Produced by Lambesis , the album peaked at No. 30 on Billboard 's Independent Albums chart and No. 41 on the Top Heatseekers chart . William York of Allmusic thought the band " doesn 't really add anything new to the mix from a musical standpoint " with the release , while also praising it for being " solid enough and well executed " with " adequate " production . Sherwin Frias of Jesus Freak Hideout had similar sentiments and commented " As I Lay Dying didn 't exactly break many boundaries in making this record " , but praised that each song is " executed so well ( and with such precision ) that nary a song misses its target . " Touring then occurred to promote the album , with support from bands Himsa , Shadows Fall , The Black Dahlia Murder , Killswitch Engage , In Flames , Sworn Enemy , and Hatebreed . Music videos for the songs " 94 Hours " and " Forever " received rotation on networks such as Fuse and MTV2 's Headbanger 's Ball .

 As I Lay Dying entered Big Fish recording studio in Encinitas , California , US in January 2005 to record their third studio album . Shadows Are Security was released in June of the same year and debuted at No. 1 on the Independent Albums chart . It was also the band 's first release to enter the Billboard 200 — at No. 35 — and sold about 275 @,@ 000 copies . Wade <unk> of Allmusic called it " one of the strongest releases of 2005 , " and commented that new guitarists Phil Sgrosso and Nick Hipa make the band " stronger . " Rod Smith of Decibel Magazine commented : " Tim Lambesis 's finely honed roar in bittersweet instrumental matrices augmented by occasional clean vocals by bassist Clint Norris . Guitarists Phil Sgrosso and Nick Hipa whip up a melodic cyclone on ' The Darkest Nights ' . " By this time , guitarist Evan White had quit the band for personal reasons after his mother died . All the singing was done by Dave Arthur of Kings to You , because it sounded more powerful in the studio in comparison to Clint Norris 's singing . 
 As I Lay Dying began touring to promote the new record by making appearances at Hell on Earth , Winter Headline Tour , and Ozzfest , as well as a tour with Slipknot and Unearth . The band was on the second stage alongside Rob Zombie , Killswitch Engage , Mastodon , The Haunted , and It Dies Today . The band raised its profile in 2006 through its support slot on the Taste of Chaos tour in the US , alongside bands such as Deftones , Thrice , <unk> , Funeral for a Friend , and Story of the Year . In May 2006 , Beneath the Encasing of Ashes and the songs from the split album were re @-@ released through Metal Blade Records as A Long March : The First Recordings . The album contained the original and re @-@ recorded versions of the songs from the split album — the band preferred to re @-@ release the material , as they didn 't want their fans paying large sums of money to listen to early releases . The re @-@ release peaked at No. 3 on the Independent Albums chart and No. 129 on the Billboard 200 chart . In mid @-@ 2006 , As I Lay Dying was the headline act at the Sounds of the Underground Festival . 
 Norris left the band on good terms in November 2006 with a desire to focus on his marriage . The band auditioned ten bassists , but none proved successful . Lambesis received demo tapes from a band called This Endearing , of which bassist Josh Gilbert was a member ; however , Lambesis chose to " sit on it " and waited for the band to record more material . This Endearing subsequently disbanded and Gilbert was recruited as As I Lay Dying 's new bassist . 
 In 2007 As I Lay Dying started recording a new album titled An Ocean Between Us , which was released on August 21 , 2007 . Debuting at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Top Rock chart , with first @-@ week sales of 39 @,@ 000 units , the album was the highest charting release for the band . 
 Co @-@ produced by Killswitch Engage guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz and As I Lay Dying , and mixed by Colin Richardson , the album received generally positive reviews . Christa L. Titus of Billboard commented : " Whatever the differences between As I Lay Dying 's personal desires and what its fans demand , this album surely acts as a bridge , " praising the song " Comfort <unk> " for its guitar solo . Scott Alisoglu of Blabbermouth.net described the album as " a well @-@ rounded and often thrashy metalcore album , as the band has struck an effective balance between aggression and accessible melodies . " Thom Jurek of Allmusic praised the band for expanding its musical range by including melodic singing and choruses , as they had previously done on " Confined " from Shadows Are Security . It was the first time that bassist Gilbert recorded a studio album with the band . 
 To promote the album , As I Lay Dying performed at the Warped Tour 2007 in August , and toured through Europe in September with Darkest Hour , Himsa , and Maroon . The band was awarded the title " Ultimate Metal God " by MTV2 's " All That Rocks " special , and was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of " Best Metal Performance " for the song " Nothing Left " . The other Grammy Award nominees included winner Slayer , King Diamond , Machine Head , and Shadows Fall . The band played a portion of the 2008 Warped Tour , as well as the Taste of Chaos UK 2008 Tour with headliners Atreyu . 
 On April 9 , 2009 , the DVD This Is Who We Are was released in Europe , and was released in the US on April 14 , 2009 . The DVD was certified Gold in the US almost a month after its release .

The album was officially released on May 11 , 2010 and received generally positive critical acclaim , with one critic saying : " Fans of metalcore in general , and As I Lay Dying in particular , will be more than satisfied with The Powerless Rise , as the band 's gradual progression and consistency makes this their best album . " 
 In 2010 the band toured in support of The Powerless Rise , headlining the majority of their shows . In the first half of the year , the band embarked on a US tour with Demon Hunter , <unk> , and War of Ages . This was followed by a mid @-@ 2010 headlining tour titled " The Cool Tour " across the US , and a headlining tour across US / Canada that also featured All That Remains , Unearth , and Carnifex . The band 's final headline tour of the year was in Europe , with Heaven Shall Burn , Suicide Silence , and <unk> . 
 In February 2011 , the band headlined a US tour with support from Winds of Plague and After the Burial . The band then toured in late April / early May with Trivium , in support of Disturbed , on the " Music as a Weapon " tour in Australia and New Zealand . Then at the end of May and beginning of June , the band headlined a few performances with Heaven Shall Burn . 
 On November 8 , 2011 , As I Lay Dying released a compilation , <unk> , in honor of the band 's ten @-@ year anniversary . The album featured three new , original songs ; four cover versions of songs by bands such as Slayer , Judas Priest and Descendents ; a re @-@ recorded medley that uses parts of several songs taken from Beneath the Encasing of Ashes ; and four remixes , consisting of one song from each of their albums since Frail Words Collapse . The album 's first track " Paralyzed " was released as a lyric video on September 13 , 2011 , and as a free download on iTunes on November 7 , the day before the album 's release .

The band announced in April 2012 that Bill Stevenson , who had previously worked with NOFX and Rise Against , would be the producer for their sixth album . 
 On June 22 , 2012 , the band announced that their sixth album would be titled Awakened and the first single " <unk> " was released on June 25 , 2012 . On September 12 , 2012 , As I Lay Dying released their second single " A Greater Foundation " with a corresponding music video .

As I Lay Dying won the " Metal Band of the Year " award from Loudwire in 2012 , beating other well @-@ known bands , including Anthrax and Lamb of God . Subsequently , prior to his criminal charges , Lambesis started a new band entitled <unk> with guitarist Ryan <unk> , formerly of <unk> . They released one EP as a band . 
 On May 7 , 2013 , Lambesis was arrested in Oceanside , California , US after allegedly hiring an undercover detective to kill his estranged wife . The report was made by the San Diego County Sheriff 's Department , leaving the future of the band uncertain . On the following day , the band released a statement in which they said : " The legal process is taking its course and we have no more information than you do . There are many unanswered questions , and the situation will become clearer in the coming days and weeks . We 'll keep you informed as best we can . " They also stated that their thoughts were " with Tim , his family , and with everyone else affected by this terrible situation . " Eight days later , the band cancelled their mid @-@ 2013 tour with Killswitch Engage , stating that " we feel that it is best for the band to be off the road while the current situation gets sorted " . During the month of his initial arrest , Lambesis pleaded " not guilty " and his lawyer stated : " His thought processes were devastatingly affected by his steroid use . " On February 25 , 2014 Lambesis changed his plea from " not guilty " to " guilty " and consequently faced a potential sentence of nine years in prison . 
 Rather than continue on without Lambesis , Mancino , along with ex @-@ members Phil Sgrosso , Nick Hipa , and Josh Gilbert , decided to focus on a different style of music under a different band name , <unk> , with Shane Blay as the vocalist , This project took shape long before Lambesis ' <unk> although Mancino still remains a member of As I Lay Dying . During this period of time Lambesis was also working on music and found time to release the third full length from Austrian Death Machine called Triple Brutal . 
 On May 16 , 2014 , Lambesis was sentenced to six years in prison , with 48 days credit for time served . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 As I lay Dying 's musical style is primarily described as metalcore and melodic metalcore . The band also has been referred to as thrash metal . Their music often mixes melodic death metal and hardcore punk together . In a review of Beneath the Encasing of Ashes , Bradley Torreano of Allmusic described the band 's sound as a blend of heavy metal , hardcore , and grindcore . <unk> described An Ocean Between Us and The Powerless Rise as incorporating classic metal into the <unk> sound . Heavy metal writer Garry Sharpe @-@ Young described the band as a " Christian Hardcore act employing the Grind edged vocals of singer Tim Lambesis and a distinct hint of Scandinavian guitar chug . " 
 = = Christianity = = 
 Although As I Lay Dying has stated on numerous occasions that all of the members of the group are practicing Christians , the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre , not Christian metal . This is largely because the band 's lyrics do not directly focus on pro @-@ Christian themes the way many praise music bands do nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts . For example , not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song , nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible . Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality . 
 Lyricist and lead singer Tim Lambesis has given mixed commentary on the subject : when asked in 2008 if the members were " a Christian band " or " Christians in a band " , Lambesis stated on the band 's FAQ , " I 'm not sure what the difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band , If you truly believe something , then it should affect every area of your life . All five of us are Christians . I believe that change should start with me first , and as a result , our lyrics do not come across very ' preachy . ' Many of our songs are about life , struggles , mistakes , relationships and other issues that don 't fit entirely in the spiritual category . However , all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian . " Furthermore , during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast , Lambesis stated " I can only really write about what I 'm passionate about in life , so naturally my faith , my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics . " 
 However , in later years , Lambesis showed an increasing philosophical skepticism towards Christianity and religion in general : Court documents stated Lambesis emailed his wife <unk> in August 2012 , while on tour with As I Lay Dying , asking for a divorce and stating he " no longer believed in God " . In explaining some of the lyrics from Awakened , Lambesis stated that his studies of theology had led him to the conclusion that " tradition and truth are often at odds with each other " , and while he " didn 't hate all religious belief " , he was finding it " very difficult for to outline exactly who it is that 's worth siding with . " He also quoted the book Pagan Christianity by George Barna and Frank Viola , noting that both " Protestant and Catholic denominations have poisonous roots " . 
 While on house arrest in July 2013 , after being charged with soliciting his wife 's murder , Lambesis published a blog post in which he obliquely confirmed his previous loss of faith in Christianity . However , since his arrest it has been reported that Lambesis " has spent much of the last year reevaluating what originally convinced him to abandon belief in God . After much brokenness and repentance he sees things differently , considers himself a follower of Jesus , someone submitted to the will of God . " 
 In 2014 , Lambesis said that although they were marketed as a Christian band , the members privately considered themselves atheists . Former guitarist Nick Hipa calls these claims slanderous and defamatory .

 The music video for " Unbroken " was shot in Melbourne and Sydney , Australia on 8 April 2010 and was directed by Matthew Chuang . It features Walker singing in various locations in Melbourne including <unk> Street and Flinders Lane . Walker said to MTV 's <unk> ' that shooting the video in public made him feel embarrassed and he found it difficult not to laugh during its filming . 
 The video opens with the camera rotating around Walker at an intersection as he slowly raises his head , before he is shown walking down a shop @-@ lined street . As the song begins , Walker starts singing in an empty narrow alleyway . Examples of broken people are shown , such as a girl being pushed around and teased before she plugs headphones into her ears , a man watching over a hospital patient , and individuals waiting for others to show up . Walker passes a bench of people reading newspapers with the respective headlines , " Attacked " , " War " , " When Will It End ? " and " Act of Hate " , while the final newspaper headline reads " Hope " . At the end of the video the now " unbroken " characters shot in Martin Place are shown to be content , and Walker makes his way down a darkened alley .

 = To the Stars ( novel ) = 
 To the Stars is a science fiction novel by L. Ron Hubbard . The novel 's story is set in a dystopian future , and chronicles the experiences of protagonist Alan Corday aboard a starship called the Hound of Heaven as he copes with the travails of time dilation from traveling at near light speed . Corday is kidnapped by the ship 's captain and forced to become a member of their crew , and when he next returns to Earth his fiancee has aged and barely remembers him . He becomes accustomed to life aboard the ship , and when the captain dies Corday assumes command . 
 Hubbard 's story was first published by John W. Campbell in two parts in a serialized format in 1950 in Astounding Science Fiction . It was first published in book format in 1954 under the title Return to Tomorrow , and was published in hardcover in 1975 under the same title . In 1997 , film producers were in the process of developing the work as a movie for Touchstone Pictures . Jazz musician Chick Corea released a 2004 album of the same name with music inspired by the story , and Galaxy Press reissued a hardcover edition of Hubbard 's novel the same year as a form of cross marketing . 
 The book was generally positively received , and garnered a 2001 nomination for a " Retro " Hugo Award for Best Novella . Publishers Weekly gave the book a positive review , calling it one of Hubbard 's " finest works " , and Alan Cheuse highlighted the work on National Public Radio 's program All Things Considered as a top literature holiday pick . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Protagonist Alan Corday is a young engineer , and is kidnapped from a spaceport called " New Chicago " and taken aboard the interstellar trading starship Hound of Heaven . The ship is commanded by a charismatic leader named Captain Jocelyn , who tells Corday to use his skills to help the Hound of Heaven in its travels between Earth and space colonies in other star systems . On the first page of the book 's prologue Hubbard cites " the basic equation of mass and time .... AS <unk> <unk> <unk> , TIME <unk> ZERO " , meaning that interstellar travelers at near light speed experience time relative to their environment , and when they return to their home star will find that decades or centuries may have passed . Six weeks of time aboard the ship amounts to roughly nine years experienced by those on Earth . Corday resists mingling with the culture aboard the starship , but when he returns home after travels with the Hound of Heaven he finds that his fiancee has aged and has trouble with her memory . Corday realizes his only home has become that of the starship . Captain Jocelyn is killed in an ambush on a dystopian Earth , and Corday takes command of the ship . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 To the Stars was first published in two parts in February and March 1950 in a serialized format by John W. Campbell in Astounding Science Fiction . Hubbard had previously written the story Ole Doc Methuselah for Astounding Science Fiction in 1947 , later published as a book in 1992 . In 1954 the story was published in book format by Ace Books in a paperback first edition , under the title Return to Tomorrow . Garland Publishing released a hardcover edition of Return to Tomorrow in 1975 . 
 In 1997 Hollywood producers were working on developing a film version of To the Stars . Producers Barbara Boyle and Michael Taylor were preparing to bring the book to the film screen for Touchstone Pictures , a division of Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group . Boyle and Taylor had previously worked with actor John Travolta on the film Phenomenon , and the project was planned to be part of Travolta 's vision to make films out of L. Ron Hubbard 's science fiction novels . Hubbard 's novel Battlefield Earth was first on his list , and Travolta starred in and helped fund the film version of the book which was released in 2000 . A film version of To the Stars had not yet begun production as of 2008 . 
 The jazz musician Chick Corea released a CD of the same name with music inspired by the story in 2004 , and Galaxy Press reissued a hardcover edition of Hubbard 's novel the same year as a form of cross marketing . According to Publishers Weekly , Corea 's soundtrack to the novel was issued by Galaxy Press to give the company 's " enormous marketing muscle " the ability to " tap into the vast Hubbard fan base " . Corea explains at his website how he was motivated to work on music inspired by the book . He comments that he was inspired by a scene from the book where Hubbard describes the Captain of the Hound of Heaven spaceship playing a melody on a piano .

 To the Stars was nominated by the World Science Fiction Society for a " Retro " Hugo Award for Best Novella in 2001 , losing to The Man Who Sold the Moon by Robert A. Heinlein . The " To the Stars " science @-@ fiction magazine was published by Bridge Publications . 
 The book generally received positive reception from literature critics . Publishers Weekly described it as " golden SF from the Golden Age " , and The Harvard Crimson called it " one of the great classics " of the Golden Age of Science Fiction . A reviewer writing in Publishers Weekly commented : " Hubbard brilliantly evokes the vastness of space and the tragedy of those who would conquer it " , and called the book " one of his [ Hubbard 's ] finest works " . Alan Cheuse reviewed the book in the San Francisco Chronicle , writing : " As in a number of groundbreaking -- or time @-@ breaking , I suppose we ought to say -- works of science fiction , the science behind the story is more interesting than the fiction itself . Hubbard is a thinker who writes , rather than a writer who thinks , as most masters are . " Cheuse highlighted the book among his 2004 literature holiday picks in a piece for National Public Radio 's program All Things Considered : " Before he began founding new religions , Hubbard was one of the country 's most prolific pulp science fiction writers , and this book is one of his best . " Georges T. Dodds , columnist for WARP , newsletter / fanzine of the Montreal Science Fiction and Fantasy association writes " besides being among the earliest hard science fiction works to consider time @-@ dilation effects in long distance near @-@ light @-@ speed space travel , ( To The Stars ) is a pretty entertaining story . " 
 Barnes & Noble 's Explorations editor , Paul Goat Allen , put the book at number eight on his list of the top ten science fiction / fantasy novels for 2004 , writing : " After more than half a century , ' To the Stars ' is just as timely , just as awe @-@ inspiring , just as profoundly moving as it was in 1950 . " In a review of the book for the website SF Site , Georges T. Dodds writes : " To the Stars , besides being among the earliest hard science fiction works to consider time @-@ dilation effects in long @-@ distance near @-@ light @-@ speed space travel , is a pretty entertaining story . " Writing in the Marburg Journal of Religion , Marco Frenschkowski of the University of Mainz described the book as a " melancholy tale about interplanetary travel and the effects of time dilation " . University of California , Irvine physics professor and science fiction author Gregory Benford wrote positively of the book in an article for the science fiction website " Crows Nest " : " Writers had used Einstein 's special relativity theory before in stories , but Hubbard brought to his novel the compressed story telling and pulp skills that had stood him in over a decade of professional writing . " 
 Galaxy reviewer Groff Conklin described the 1954 edition as " a fast @-@ paced and grim adventure . . . just short of absurdity , but interesting nevertheless . " Anthony Boucher panned the novel , calling it " a surprisingly routine and plotless space opera . " 
 In addition to Chick Corea 's album , which is directly based on the novel , it was also referenced in the 1996 album Fantastic Planet by the band Failure , the cover art of which is based on the book cover of the first edition of Return to Tomorrow . 
 = Gregory of Nyssa = 
 Gregory of Nyssa , also known as Gregory Nyssen ( Greek : <unk> <unk> ; c . 335 – c . 395 ) , was bishop of Nyssa from 372 to 376 and from 378 until his death . He is venerated as a saint in Roman Catholicism , Eastern Orthodoxy , Oriental Orthodoxy , Lutheranism , and Anglicanism . Gregory , his elder brother Basil of Caesarea , and their friend Gregory of Nazianzus are collectively known as the Cappadocian Fathers . 
 Gregory lacked the administrative ability of his brother Basil or the contemporary influence of Gregory of Nazianzus , but he was an erudite theologian who made significant contributions to the doctrine of the Trinity and the Nicene Creed . Gregory 's philosophical writings were influenced by Origen . Since the mid @-@ twentieth century , there has been a significant increase in interest in Gregory 's works from the academic community , particularly involving universal salvation , which has resulted in challenges to many traditional interpretations of his theology . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the book of Acts , it depicts that at on the Day of Pentecost , that there were visiting Jews who were " residents of ... Cappadocia " in attendance . In the First Epistle of Peter , written after AD 65 , the author greets Christians who are " exiles scattered throughout … <unk> . " There is no further reference to Cappadocia in the rest of the New Testament . 
 Christianity arose in Cappadocia relatively late with no evidence of a Christian community before the late second century AD . Alexander of Jerusalem was the first bishop of the province in the early to mid third century , a period in which Christians suffered persecution from the local Roman authorities . The community remained very small throughout the third century : when Gregory Thaumaturgus acceded to the bishopric in c . 250 , according to his namesake , the Nyssen , there were only seventeen members of the Church in Caesarea . 
 Cappadocian bishops were among those at the Council of Nicaea . Because of the broad distribution of the population , rural bishops [ <unk> ] were appointed to support the Bishop of Caesarea . During the late fourth century there were around fifty of them . In Gregory 's lifetime , the Christians of Cappadocia were devout , with the cults of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste and Saint George being particularly significant and represented by a considerable monastic presence . There were some adherents of heretical branches of Christianity , most notably Arians , <unk> and <unk> . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life and education = = = 
 Gregory was born around 335 , probably in or near the city of <unk> , Pontus . His family was aristocratic and Christian - according to Gregory of Nazianzus , his mother was <unk> of Caesarea , and his father , a rhetorician , has been identified either as Basil the Elder or as a Gregory . Among his eight siblings were St. Macrina the Younger , St. <unk> , St. Peter of Sebaste and St. Basil of Caesarea . The precise number of children in the family was historically contentious : the commentary on 30 May in the Acta Sanctorum , for example , initially states that they were nine , before describing Peter as the tenth child . It has been established that this confusion occurred due to the death of one son in infancy , leading to ambiguities in Gregory 's own writings . Gregory 's parents had suffered persecution for their faith : he writes that they " had their goods confiscated for confessing Christ . " Gregory 's maternal grandmother , Macrina the Elder is also revered as a saint and his maternal grandfather was a martyr as Gregory put it " killed by Imperial wrath " under the persecution of the Roman Emperor Maximinus II . Between the 320 's to the early 340 's the family rebuilt its fortunes , with Gregory 's father working in the city of <unk> as an advocate and rhetorician . 
 Gregory 's temperament is said to be quiet and meek , in contrast to his brother Basil who was known to be much more outspoken . 
 Gregory was first educated at home , by his mother <unk> and sister Macrina . Little is known of what further education he received . Apocryphal hagiographies depict him studying at Athens , but this is speculation probably based on the life of his brother Basil . It seems more likely that he continued his studies in Caesarea , where he read classical literature , philosophy and perhaps medicine . Gregory himself claimed that his only teachers were Basil , " Paul , John and the rest of the Apostles and prophets " . 
 While his brothers Basil and <unk> lived as hermits from c . 355 , Gregory initially pursued a non @-@ ecclesiastical career as a rhetorician . He did however , act as a lector . He is known to have married a woman named Theosebia during this period , who is sometimes identified with Theosebia the Deaconess , venerated as a saint by Orthodox Christianity . This is controversial , however , and other commentators suggest that Theosebia the Deaconess was one of Gregory 's sisters . 
 = = = Episcopate = = = 
 In 371 , the Emperor Valens split Cappadocia into two new provinces , Cappadocia Prima and Cappadocia Secunda . This resulted in complex changes in ecclesiastical boundaries , during which several new bishoprics were created . Gregory was elected bishop of the new see of Nyssa in 372 , presumably with the support of his brother Basil , who was metropolitan of Caesarea . Gregory 's early policies as bishop often went against those of Basil : for instance , while his brother condemned the <unk> followers of Marcellus of Ancyra as heretics , Gregory may have tried to reconcile them with the church . 
 Gregory faced opposition to his reign in Nyssa , and , in 373 <unk> , bishop of Iconium had to visit the city to quell discontent . In 375 <unk> of Pontus convened a synod at Ancyra to try Gregory on charges of embezzlement of church funds and irregular ordination of bishops . He was arrested by imperial troops in the winter of the same year , but escaped to an unknown location . The synod of Nyssa , which was convened in the spring of 376 , deposed him . However , Gregory regained his see in 378 , perhaps due to an amnesty promulgated by the new emperor Gratian . In the same year Basil died , and despite the relative unimportance of Nyssa , Gregory took over many of his brother 's former responsibilities in Pontus . 
 He was present at the Synod of Antioch in April 379 , where he unsuccessfully attempted to reconcile the followers of Meletius of Antioch with those of Paulinus . After visiting the village of <unk> to see his dying sister Macrina , he returned to Nyssa in August . In 380 he travelled to Sebaste , in the province of Armenia Prima , to support a pro @-@ Nicene candidate for the election to the bishopric . To his surprise , he himself was elected to the seat , perhaps due to the population 's association of him with his brother . However , Gregory deeply disliked the relatively <unk> society of Armenia , and he was confronted by an investigation into his orthodoxy by local opponents of the Nicene theology . After a stay of several months , a substitute was found - possibly Gregory 's brother Peter , who was bishop of Sebaste from 381 - and Gregory returned home to Nyssa to write books I and II of Against Eunomius . 
 Gregory participated in the First Council of Constantinople ( 381 ) , and perhaps gave there his famous sermon In <unk> <unk> . He was chosen to eulogise at the funeral of <unk> , which occurred during the council . The council sent Gregory on a mission to Arabia , perhaps to ameliorate the situation in Bostra , where two men , Agapius and <unk> , claimed to be bishop . If this is the case , Gregory was unsuccessful , as the see was still contested in 394 . He then travelled to Jerusalem , where Cyril of Jerusalem faced opposition from local clergy due to the fact that he had been ordained by Acacius of Caesarea , an Arian heretic . Gregory 's attempted mediation of the dispute was unsuccessful , and he himself was accused of holding unorthodox views on the nature of Christ . His later reign in Nyssa was marked by conflict with his Metropolitan , <unk> . Gregory was present at a 394 synod convened at Constantinople to discuss the continued problems in Bostra . The year of his death is unknown . 
 = = Theology = = 
 The traditional view of Gregory is that he was an orthodox Trinitarian theologian , who was influenced by the neoplatonism of Plotinus and believed in universal salvation following Origen . However , as a highly original and sophisticated thinker , Gregory is difficult to classify , and many aspects of his theology are contentious among both conservative Eastern Orthodox theologians and Western academic scholarship . This is often due to the lack of systematic structure and the presence of terminological inconsistencies in Gregory 's work . 
 = = = Conception of the Trinity = = = 
 Gregory , following Basil , defined the Trinity as " one essence [ <unk> ] in three persons [ <unk> ] " , the formula adopted by the Council of Constantinople in 381 . Like the other Cappadocian Fathers , he was a <unk> , and Against Eunomius affirms the truth of the <unk> of the trinity over Eunomius ' Aristotelian belief that the Father 's substance is <unk> , whereas the Son 's is engendered . According to Gregory , the differences between the three persons of the Trinity reside in their relationships with each other , and the triune nature of God is revealed through divine action ( despite the unity of God in His action ) . The Son is therefore defined as begotten of the Father , the Holy Spirit as proceeding from the Father and the Son , and the Father by his role as progenitor . However , this doctrine would seem to subordinate the Son to the Father , and the Holy Spirit to the Son . Robert Jenson suggests that Gregory implies that each member of the Godhead has an individual priority : the Son has epistemological priority , the Father has <unk> priority and the Spirit has metaphysical priority . Other commentators disagree : Morwenna Ludlow , for instance , argues that epistemic priority resides primarily in the Spirit in Gregory 's theology . 
 Modern proponents of social Trinitarianism often claim to have been influenced by the Cappadocians ' dynamic picture of the Trinity . However , it would be fundamentally incorrect to identify Gregory as a social Trinitarian , as his theology emphasises the unity of God 's will , and he clearly believes that the identities of the Trinity are the three persons , not the relations between them . 
 = = = <unk> of God = = = 
 Gregory was one of the first theologians to argue , in opposition to Origen , that God is infinite . His main argument for the infinity of God , which can be found in Against Eunomius , is that God 's goodness is limitless , and as God 's goodness is essential , God is also limitless . 
 An important consequence of Gregory 's belief in the infinity of God is his belief that God , as limitless , is essentially incomprehensible to the limited minds of created beings . In Life of Moses , Gregory writes : " ... every concept that comes from some comprehensible image , by an approximate understanding and by guessing at the Divine nature , constitutes a idol of God and does not proclaim God . " Gregory 's theology was thus apophatic : he proposed that God should be defined in terms of what we know He is not rather than what we might speculate Him to be . 
 Accordingly , the Nyssen taught that due to God 's <unk> , a created being can never reach an understanding of God , and thus for man in both life and the afterlife there is a constant progression [ <unk> ] towards the unreachable knowledge of God , as the individual continually transcends all which has been reached before . In the Life of Moses , Gregory speaks of three stages of this spiritual growth : initial darkness of ignorance , then spiritual illumination , and finally a darkness of the mind in mystic contemplation of the God who cannot be comprehended . 
 = = = Universalism = = = 
 Gregory seems to have believed in the universal salvation of all human beings . Gregory argues that when Paul says that God will be " all in all " ( 1 Cor . 15 : 28 ) , this means that though some may need long time of purification , eventually " no being will remain outside the number of the saved " and that " no being created by God will fall outside the Kingdom of God " . Gregory also described God 's work this way : " His [ God 's ] end is one , and one only ; it is this : when the complete whole of our race shall have been perfected from the first man to the last — some having at once in this life been cleansed from evil , others having afterwards in the necessary periods been healed by the Fire , others having in their life here been unconscious equally of good and of evil — to offer to every one of us participation in the blessings which are in Him , which , the Scripture tells us , ' eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , ' nor thought ever reached . " That this is what Gregory believed and taught is affirmed by most scholars . A minority of scholars have argued that Gregory only affirmed the universal resurrection . 
 In the Life of Moses , Gregory writes that just as the darkness left the Egyptians after three days , perhaps redemption [ <unk> ] will be extended to those suffering in hell [ <unk> ] . This salvation may not only extend to humans ; following Origen , there are passages where he seems to suggest ( albeit through the voice of Macrina ) that even the demons will have a place in Christ 's " world of goodness " . Gregory 's interpretations of 1 Corinthians 15 : 28 ( " And when all things shall be subdued unto him ... " ) and Philippians 2 : 10 ( " That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of things in heaven , and things in earth , and things under the earth " ) support this understanding of his theology . 
 However , in the Great Catechism , Gregory suggests that while every human will be resurrected , salvation will only be accorded to the baptised , although he also states that others driven by their passions can be saved after being purified by fire . While he believes that there will be no more evil in the hereafter , it is arguable that this does not preclude a belief that God might justly damn sinners for eternity . Thus , the main difference between Gregory 's conception of <unk> and that of Origen would be that Gregory believes that mankind will be collectively returned to <unk> , whereas Origen believes that personal salvation will be universal . This interpretation of Gregory has been criticized recently , however . 
 Attempting to reconcile these disparate positions , Orthodox theologian Mario <unk> notes that " when taken at face value the saint seems to be contradicting himself in these passages ; on the one hand he asserted the salvation of all and the complete eradication of evil , and , on the other , that the fire needed to purge evil is ‘ sleepless ’ , i.e. everlasting . The only solution to this inconsistency is to view any allusion to universal salvation in St Gregory as an expression of God ’ s intention for humanity , which is in fact attested to when his holy sister states that God has “ one goal [ … ] some straightway even in this life purified from evil , others healed hereafter through fire for the appropriate length of time . ” That we can choose either to accept or ignore this purification is confirmed by the saint ’ s many exhortations that we freely undertake the virtuous path . " Dr. <unk> Ramelli has made the observation that for Gregory free will was compatible with universal salvation , since every person would eventually accept the good having gone through purification . 
 = = = Anthropology = = = 
 Gregory 's anthropology is founded on the ontological distinction between the created and uncreated . Man is a material creation , and thus limited , but infinite in that his immortal soul has an indefinite capacity to grow closer to the divine . Gregory believed that the soul is created simultaneous to the creation of the body ( in opposition to Origen , who believed in <unk> ) , and that embryos were thus persons . To Gregory , the human being is exceptional , being created in the image of God . Humanity is <unk> both in having self @-@ awareness and free will , the latter which gives each individual existential power , because to Gregory , in disregarding God one negates one 's own existence . In the Song of Songs , Gregory metaphorically describes human lives as paintings created by apprentices to a master : the apprentices ( the human wills ) imitate their master 's work ( the life of Christ ) with beautiful colors ( virtues ) , and thus man strives to be a reflection of Christ . Gregory , in stark contrast to most thinkers of his age , saw great beauty in the Fall : from Adam 's sin from two perfect humans would eventually arise myriad . 
 Gregory was also one of the first Christian voices to say that slavery as an institution was inherently sinful . He believed that slavery violated mankind 's inherent worth , and the nature of humanity to be free ; a departure from classical , and Judeo @-@ Christian precedent which he rooted in Genesis , arguing that man was given mastery of animals but not of mankind . Although aspects of the slave system had been criticized by Stoics such as Seneca , this was the first and only sustained critique of the institution of slavery itself made in the ancient world . 
 In Homilies on Ecclesiastes , he wrote : " ' I got me slave @-@ girls and slaves . ' For what price , tell me ? What did you find in existence worth as much as this human nature ? What price did you put on rationality ? How many obols did you reckon the equivalent of the likeness of God ? How many staters did you get for selling that being shaped by God ? God said , Let us make man in our own image and likeness . If he is in the likeness of God , and rules the whole earth , and has been granted authority over everything on earth from God , who is his buyer , tell me ? Who is his seller ? To God alone belongs this power ; or , rather , not even to God himself . For his gracious gifts , it says , are irrevocable . God would not therefore reduce the human race to slavery , since he himself , when we had been enslaved to sin , spontaneously recalled us to freedom . But if God does not enslave what is free , who is he that sets his own power above God 's ? " 
 = = = Neoplatonism = = = 
 There are many similarities between Gregory 's theology and <unk> philosophy , especially that of Plotinus . Specifically , they share the idea that the reality of God is completely inaccessible to human beings and that man can only come to see God through a spiritual journey in which knowledge [ γνῶσις ] is rejected in favour of meditation . Gregory does not refer to any <unk> philosophers in his work , and there is only one disputed passage which may directly quote Plotinus . Considering this , it seems possible that Gregory was familiar with Plotinus and perhaps other figures in neoplatonism . However , some significant differences between neoplatonism and Gregory 's thought exist , such as Gregory 's statement that beauty and goodness are equivalent , which contrasts with Plotinus ' view that they are two different qualities . 
 Eastern Orthodox theologians are generally critical of the theory that Gregory was influenced by neoplatonism . For example , Metropolitan Hierotheos of <unk> argues in Life After Death that Gregory opposed all philosophical ( as opposed to theological ) endeavour as tainted with worldliness . This view is supported by Against <unk> , where Gregory denounces <unk> for placing the results of his systematic <unk> philosophy above the traditional teachings of the Church .

 Gregory is revered as a saint . However , unlike the other Cappadocian fathers , he is not a Doctor of the Church . He is venerated chiefly in the East . His relics were held by the Vatican until 2000 , when they were translated to the Greek Orthodox church of St. Gregory of Nyssa , San Diego , California . 
 Gregory 's work received little scholarly attention in the West until the mid @-@ twentieth century , and he was historically treated as a minor figure in comparison to Basil the Great or Gregory of Nazianzus . As late as 1942 , Hans Urs von Balthasar wrote that his work was virtually unknown . In part due to the scholarship of Balthasar and Jean Daniélou , by the 1950s Gregory became the subject of much serious theological research , with a critical edition of his work published ( <unk> <unk> Opera ) , and the founding of the International Colloquium on Gregory of Nyssa . This attention has continued to the present day . Modern studies have mainly focused on Gregory 's eschatology rather than his more dogmatic writings , and he has gained a reputation as an unconventional thinker whose thought arguably prefigures postmodernism . Major figures in contemporary research include Sarah Coakley , John <unk> and Robert Jenson . 
 = = Commentary on Gregory = = 
 In 787 AD , the Seventh Ecumenical Council of the Church , ( also known as the Second Council of Nicea ) honored Gregory of Nyssa : 
 " Let us then , consider who were the venerable doctors and indomitable champions of the Church ... [ including ] Gregory Primate of Nyssa , who all have called the father of fathers . " 
 Henry Fairfield Osborn wrote in his work on the history of evolutionary thought , From the Greeks to Darwin ( 1894 ) : 
 Among the Christian Fathers the movement towards a partly naturalistic interpretation of the order of Creation was made by Gregory of Nyssa in the fourth century , and was completed by Augustine in the fourth and fifth centuries . ... [ Gregory ] taught that Creation was potential . God imparted to matter its fundamental properties and laws . The objects and completed forms of the Universe developed gradually out of chaotic material . 
 Anthony Meredith writes of Gregory 's mystical and apophatic writings in his book Gregory of Nyssa ( The Early Church Fathers ) ( 1999 ) : 
 " Gregory has often been credited with the discovery of mystical theology , or rather with the perception that darkness is an appropriate symbol under which God can be discussed . There is much truth in this .... Gregory seems to have been the first Christian writer to have made this important point ... " 
 J. Kameron Carter writes about Gregory 's stance on slavery , in the book Race a Theological Account ( 2008 ) : 
 " What interests me is the defining features of Gregory 's vision of the just society : his unequivocal stance against ' the peculiar institution of slavery ' and his call for the manumission of all slaves . I am interested in reading Gregory as a fourth century abolitionist intellectual .... His outlook surpassed not only St. Paul 's more moderate ( but to be fair to Paul , in his moment , revolutionary ) stance on the subject but also those of all ancient intellectuals -- Pagan , Jewish and Christian - from Aristotle to Cicero and from Augustine in the Christian West to his contemporary , the golden mouthed preacher himself , John <unk> in the East . Indeed , the world would have to wait another fifteen centuries -- until the nineteenth century , late into the modern abolitionist movement -- before such an unequivocal stance against slavery would appear again .

 Odwalla Inc . / <unk> / is an American food product company that sells fruit juice , smoothies and food bars . It was founded in Santa Cruz , California , in 1980 and is headquartered in Half Moon Bay , California . 
 The company experienced strong growth after its incorporation in 1985 , expanding its distribution network from California to most of North America , and went public in 1993 . A period of decline occurred as a result of a fatal outbreak of E.coli @-@ H7 in 1996 that was caused by using bruised fruit that had been contaminated . Odwalla originally sold unpasteurized juices , claiming that the process of pasteurization altered the flavor of the juice . Following the E.coli outbreak , Odwalla adopted flash pasteurization and other sanitization procedures . Odwalla recalled its juices and experienced a ninety @-@ percent reduction in sales following the event . The company gradually recovered and the following year became profitable again . 
 In 2001 , Odwalla was acquired by The Coca @-@ Cola Company for US $ 181 million and became a wholly owned subsidiary . 
 Odwalla 's range of products includes juices , smoothies , soy milk , bottled water , organic beverages , and several types of energy bars , known as " food bars " .

 Odwalla was founded in Santa Cruz , California , in 1980 by Greg Steltenpohl , Gerry Percy , and Bonnie Bassett . Odwalla 's production facility is in <unk> , California . The trio took the idea of selling fruit juices from a business guidebook , and they began by squeezing orange juice with a secondhand <unk> in a shed in Steltenpohl 's backyard . They sold their product from the back of a Volkswagen van to local restaurants , employing slogans such as " soil to soul , people to planet and nourishing the body whole " . 
 The name for their start @-@ up , " Odwalla " , was taken from that of a character who guided " the people of the sun " out of the " gray haze " in the song @-@ poem " <unk> " , a favorite of the founders , which was composed by Roscoe Mitchell and performed by the Art Ensemble of Chicago jazz group , of which Mitchell was a member . Steltenpohl , Percy , and Bassett related this to their products , which they believe " help humans break free from the dull mass of over @-@ processed foods so prevalent today " . 
 = = = Incorporation – 1996 = = = 
 Odwalla was incorporated in September 1985 after five years of growth and expanded to sell products in San Francisco in 1988 . <unk> & Quist Inc . , a venture capital firm in San Francisco , was one of Odwalla 's main investors at the time , investing several million dollars in the company . By 1992 , the company employed 80 people at its company headquarters in Davenport , California , and sold around 20 different flavors of juice for between $ 1 @.@ 50 and $ 2 @.@ 00 a pint . Odwalla went public in December 1993 ( NASDAQ : <unk> ) ; the company had 35 delivery trucks , almost 200 employees , and made about $ 13 million a year . Soon afterwards , Odwalla expanded into new markets when it bought two companies in the Pacific Northwest and Colorado . 
 Odwalla built a new production facility located in <unk> , California , in 1994 in order to better meet production demands . The following year , the company moved its headquarters to Half Moon Bay , California . 
 Continual growth and outside investments during these years allowed the company to expand and grow : Odwalla 's revenue tripled from 1994 to 1995 , and in 1996 they made more than $ 59 million in sales , their highest ever . This constant growth made Odwalla one of the largest fresh @-@ juice companies in America by 1996 , when the company was selling its products to stores in seven states and parts of Canada . It was estimated that they would reach $ 100 million in sales by 1999 . Much of this growth resulted from the perception that Odwalla 's products were healthier than regular juice because of <unk> . 
 = = = From 1996 = = = 
 On October 7 , 1996 , Odwalla made a batch of apple juice using blemished fruit , resulting in one death and 66 sickened customers . Odwalla made and marketed unpasteurized fruit juices for the health segment of the juice market . This batch was contaminated with E. coli . 
 Despite a net loss for most of 1997 , Odwalla worked to rehabilitate its brand name . In addition to advertising its new safety procedures , Odwalla released its line of food bars ( its first solid food product line ) and entered the $ 900 million fruit bar market . Another new product was the Future Shake , a " liquid lunch " aimed at younger consumers . Because of these efforts , Odwalla was again profitable by the end of 1997 , reporting a profit of $ 140 @,@ 000 for the third quarter . 
 Having recovered , the company worked to expand geographically into markets like Philadelphia and Washington , D.C. , and by the end of 1998 reported that revenue had surpassed pre @-@ crisis levels . Growth continued over subsequent years , in part through the $ 29 million acquisition of Fresh Samantha , a large juice company based in Saco , Maine , in 2000 . This allowed Odwalla to expand into additional East Coast markets , but incurred high transportation costs as products had to be shipped across the United States from California . To address this problem the company announced plans to build a second production facility in Palm Beach County , Florida . However , facing difficulties in obtaining building permits and allocating sufficient funds , the project was first delayed and eventually cancelled . Odwalla produced and sold products under both its own and the Fresh Samantha brand names for a few years ; however , in 2003 , the company decided to stop selling juice under the Fresh Samantha name and to only sell Odwalla @-@ brand juice . 
 Odwalla was purchased by The Coca @-@ Cola Company in 2001 for $ 15 @.@ 25 a share , a deal which totalled $ 181 million and was unanimously approved by the Odwalla board of directors . Under the terms of the merger , Odwalla 's management stayed on as heads of the company , and it was " folded " into Coca @-@ Cola 's Minute Maid department . The acquisition was one of several similar mergers which were aimed at expanding Coca @-@ Cola 's product line to include non @-@ carbonated drinks . Odwalla benefited by obtaining up to a 124 @.@ 3 percent premium on shares of the company , as well as from the stability and strength that ownership by The Coca @-@ Cola Company offered . Odwalla also was able to expand into new markets because of Coca @-@ Cola 's well @-@ established distribution network . 
 Odwalla continued to grow following the acquisition . This growth resulted in part from new product releases , which included a line of <unk> pomegranate juice ( released at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival ) , two flavors of energy drinks , and three flavors of " Soy Smart " drinks , which contain soy protein , omega @-@ 3 fatty acids , and calcium . 
 Coca @-@ Cola promoted Odwalla products in 2006 when the company aimed at removing carbonated soda products in schools . Odwalla continued to have good growth in 2007 , when Coca @-@ Cola , squeezed by poor growth in its North American markets , issued a company @-@ wide hiring freeze ; Odwalla , because of its good performance , was one of the few exceptions to the rule . 
 = = Production = = 
 Odwalla uses what it characterizes as " fresh @-@ sourced " produce ( fruits and vegetables that have recently been harvested ) to make many of its products , as well as organic oats for food bars and certain tropical fruits in a frozen purée form , purchased from an outside source and blended with fruit juice . Because Odwalla uses fresh produce , some juices are seasonal . Fruit availability and price is also affected by adverse weather , disease , and natural disasters . Throughout the year , Odwalla juice colors and flavors change slightly because different types of fruit are used . 
 After the E. coli outbreak , Odwalla improved the safety of several of its production processes . Before the fruit enters the factory , it is washed , sorted and sanitized . Once it has reached the plant , the apples , carrots , and citrus fruits are separated and washed again . The fruit is pressed to get the juice , which is then flash pasteurized and bottled . A sample undergoes quality testing , and , if it passes , the batch is shipped in refrigerated trucks to various distribution centers in the United States . Odwalla juice has a relatively short shelf life compared to other beverages and thus must be refrigerated . However , after the introduction of flash pasteurization in 1996 and a new plastic bottle in 2001 , the shelf life has been considerably extended . Generally , Odwalla products are sold in special Odwalla @-@ brand displays at grocery and convenience stores , instead of being intermixed with other products .

 Odwalla Inc. produces many flavors of fruit and vegetable drinks , as well as dairy @-@ free soy milk ( marketed under the " Soy Smart " name ) , " <unk> " pomegranate juice , " Serious Energy " caffeinated fruit juice , bottled spring water , and Odwalla 's Superfood smoothie line of products ( see green smoothie ) , which are viewed as the core products of the company and are made of various fruit <unk> , wheat grass , and barley grass . These products accounted for roughly 95 percent of Odwalla 's revenue in 2001 . Odwalla juice is sold in individual 12 fl oz ( formerly 450 millilitre or 15 @.@ 4 US fl oz ) bottles made of plant @-@ based recyclable HDPE plastic , as well as larger 64 US fluid ounce ( 1 @.@ 9 litre ) containers . Odwalla 's juice , because of production costs , is " typically sold at prices higher than most other juice products " , and the price of the juice can vary over time because of weather or disease affecting the supply of fruit and vegetables . 
 Throughout its history , Odwalla has produced and subsequently withdrawn various juice flavors due to their lower popularity , including the Odwalla Superfood Amazing Purple , Soy Vanilla , and Pomegranate Mango drinks . 
 = = = Food bars = = = 
 In September 1998 , Odwalla began to sell energy bars made with fruit and grains , named food bars , as an alternative to its drinks in an attempt to raise revenue following the 1996 E. coli outbreak . The first three flavors released were Cranberry Citrus , Organic Carrot & Raisin , and Peach Crunch , all three of which are now discontinued . Within eight weeks of their release , the Odwalla Bar was one of the top @-@ selling energy bar brands in the market . The bars come in a variety of flavors , and weigh 2 ounces ( 56 grams ) per bar . As of 2001 , before Odwalla was acquired by Coca @-@ Cola , food bars accounted for less than five percent of Odwalla 's revenue . 
 = Thou Shalt Not Kill ( Spooks ) = 
 " Thou Shalt Not Kill " is the premiere episode of the British television series Spooks . It first aired on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 13 May 2002 . The episode was written by series creator David Wolstencroft and directed by Bharat Nalluri . " Thou Shalt Not Kill " focuses on MI5 's activities in stopping a pro @-@ life movement who have smuggled 20 explosive devices to be used against family planning doctors . The episode title is a reference to the sixth Commandment . 
 The pilot went through 30 rewrites and four separate story changes before the BBC were satisfied with the plot . It would be rewritten again following the September 11 attacks , with the purpose of acknowledging the series premise as battling terrorism . Filming took place mostly in London , England using a long lens camera . The idea of using split screen , regularly used by the series , came from Nalluri after filming wrapped up for the episode , and was not inspired by the American television series 24 . 
 Following its broadcast , the pilot was seen by over nine million viewers , easily winning its time slot , having nearly doubled viewership from ITV1 at the same time ; the ratings went beyond the producers ' expectations . However , critics gave varied responses towards the episode . 
 = = Plot = = 
 When a car bomb detonates in Liverpool , killing family planning doctor Karen Lynott ( Karen Westwood ) and severely injuring her young daughter Sarah , Section D of MI5 is on the case . Danny Hunter ( David Oyelowo ) learns from one of his assets , " Osprey " ( Kelly Rolfe ) , that the group responsible have smuggled 20 bombs into the country . After following her , the team learn that the terrorist responsible for smuggling the bombs and killing Lynott is Mary Kane ( Lisa Eichhorn ) , an American pro @-@ life extremist ; she smuggled herself into the country under an assumed name and has been setting up cells across the UK . Section D also learn that Kane may be setting up the attacks in tribute of her husband , who is on death row in Florida following a series of attacks in abortion clinics . Upon tracking the movements of one cell , the Central Intelligence Agency pressure MI5 to extradite Kane back to the United States ; such an action will seriously hinder their efforts to find the cells and a put a stop to them . By the time Harry Pearce ( Peter Firth ) signs the extradition forms , Kane evades MI5 . 
 In the meantime , Zoe Reynolds ( Keeley Hawes ) goes undercover to pose as a sympathizer to the cell . She lures a member , Rachel ( Rachel Power ) to the same hospital Sarah Lynott is being treated ; Sarah would later die from the extent of her injuries . Senior case officer and team leader Tom Quinn ( Matthew Macfadyen ) attempts to persuade her to stop Kane , believing she has little regard for any life . Rachel leaves in haste , but unbeknownst to her , MI5 bug her mobile phone , and record a phone conversation she makes to the cell regarding their next target , Diane Sullivan , a doctor living in London . Tom 's team are able to take Sullivan to safety whilst Zoe poses as the target . The team see Kane deliver a bomb to Zoe 's car , and prepares to detonate it via mobile phone . To counter the attack , a Bomb Squad jams the signal long enough for Tom to arrest her . During the interrogation , Tom promises to send her to a state in the US where the death penalty does not apply in exchange for the locations of every cell she runs in the UK . After she cooperates , Tom goes back on the deal and delivers Kane to CIA liaison Christine Dale ( Megan Dodds ) , who returns her to Florida to be executed . 
 Meanwhile , over the course of the episode , Tom enters a relationship with civilian Ellie Simm ( Esther Hall ) following an unrelated operation before the events of the episode , going by the pseudonym of civil servant in IT " Matthew Archer " . 
 = = Production = = 
 The script for the episode went through 30 drafts , and four separate stories before the BBC were satisfied and ordered the series . Writing the pilot was completed before the September 11 terrorist attacks ; after the attacks took place , the producers decided to add mention of the events into the episode in order to acknowledge the fact that the series is about fighting terrorism . 
 Writer David Wolstencroft decided that Tom Quinn would use IT as his cover story for Ellie Simm , because IT has , according to Wolstencroft , " something that has an enormous amount of thought and technical fact behind it that nobody would really understand , " and according to series producer Jane Featherstone , has people reluctant to be asking questions about . A scene where a cat escaped during Zoe 's operation to bug Kane 's cottage , and the ensuing search in the rain mirrored an experience during Wolstencroft 's early career . It was also intended that the episode established that although spies plan heavily before operations , things can go wrong . Among the main cast , Peter Firth was attracted to appearing on Spooks after hearing of Howard Brenton 's involvement in the series . The cast were advised by ex @-@ MI5 officers in order to help give insight into how the characters operate in the spy world and how their personal lives would be affected by it . The character Maisie Simm ( Heather Cave ) , Ellie 's daughter , was created because Featherstone believed that " children are the best spies of all " ; Maisie is often seen " spying " on Tom throughout the episode and first series . Megan Dodds guest starred as Christine Dale ; the producers were sufficiently impressed with her performance that she would later return as Dale in the second series . 
 Principal photography took place in November and December 2001 . The majority of filming was done with a long lens , which proved difficult as many filming location were short on space . 40 to 50 cuts were made in the first 10 minutes of the episode to quickly introduce the main characters . Filming took part almost entirely in London ; some London locations doubled as Liverpool locations , including the hospital , which was filmed in Covent Garden . The hospital scenes were first in the episode to be shot . The scenes set in a cottage in The Wirral were filmed in Surrey ; the cottage was dubbed the " cottage from hell " according to director Bharat Nalluri because of its small size . The Freemasons ' Hall in London served as the filming location for Thames House , the headquarters for MI5 . The Hall was chosen as the producers felt that both buildings were similar in architecture . The Grid set was filmed in a Kensington medical school . Borough Market was located to film the scenes where Kane is arrested ; filming proved to be difficult as they had to reset the scene several times . 
 The idea for split screening came to Nalluri after visiting a pub one night after filming wrapped up . In the audio commentary for the episode , Nalluri stated he was not inspired by the American series 24 , which also uses split screen , as he was not yet aware of the show . The news report covering Mary and Paul Kane 's past activities were snippets of real @-@ life news from the United States , which were edited together . The music was composed by Jennie Muskett , who spent just two to three hours putting several pieces of background music together . One part of the episode centred on Zoe posing as target Diane Sullivan . Some publicity shots of Keeley Hawes in the series were shots of her with long brunette hair , though in fact she has short blonde hair . 
 = = Broadcast and reception = = 
 The pilot was first broadcast on Monday 13 May 2002 , during the 9 to 10 pm time slot . The Spooks producers were hoping the ratings for the pilot would achieve at least six million viewers , with a 30 per cent audience share ; at the time this would be considered acceptable ratings by the BBC , as it would allow them to further consider Spooks ' future . The episode ended up with an overnight rating of 9 @.@ 2 million viewers , with a 41 per cent audience share , easily winning its time slot , and nearly doubling the numbers of ITV1 's Helen West , which was viewed by 4 @.@ 8 million with 22 per cent share in the same slot . The final numbers posted on the Broadcasters ' Audience Research Board website was up slightly to 9 @.@ 6 million viewers , making the Spooks pilot the seventh most viewed BBC One broadcast , and the tenth most viewed broadcast in total the week it aired . 
 Nancy Banks @-@ Smith of The Guardian called it " one of those shiny and <unk> series , " adding that " all that leaping out of bed at dawn on the pretext that you have to go and sell a house tends to wear thin . " Banks @-@ Smith also called the story " slightly unexpected . " She also stated " Spooks appears to plume itself on its authenticity , and there are moments , well one moment , so stupid it has to be true . " Thomas <unk> of The Independent felt it was a " different kind of spy drama " with " a literal description , derived from the sort of rueful story you could imagine being told at an MI5 staff social , " and " a lot of bullshit too , naturally . This is one of those dramas where colleagues never make small talk but instead launch straight into an urgent purposive shorthand . " Joe Joseph of The Times stated that it " bears a closer resemblance [ ... ] 24 , " which " shaded the pleasure of this opening episode , " but felt that by the end of the episode , Spooks had " established a voice of its own . " Gerard O 'Donovan of The Telegraph thought that the episode " proved thoroughly entertaining , " and praised Wolstencroft 's writing , which O 'Donovan felt was " confident enough to be playful with its subject - especially regarding Britain 's poor @-@ relation relationship with America . " Alison Graham of the Radio Times said that after the episode , the series " looks like it 's going to be great fun , " but " it 's presumably not meant to be taken too seriously , because surely life in MI5 can 't be this exciting ?

 = Battle of Lipantitlán = 
 The Battle of Lipantitlán , also known as the Battle of Nueces Crossing , was fought along the Nueces River on November 4 , 1835 between the Mexican Army and Texian insurgents , as part of the Texas Revolution . After the Texian victory at the Battle of Goliad , only two Mexican garrisons remained in Texas , Fort Lipantitlán near San Patricio and the Alamo Mission at San Antonio de Béxar ( modern @-@ day San Antonio in the U.S. state of Texas ) . Fearing that Lipantitlán could be used as a base for the Mexican army to retake Goliad and angry that two of his men were imprisoned there , Texian commander Philip Dimmitt ordered his adjutant , Captain Ira Westover , to capture the fort . 
 The commander of Fort Lipantitlán , Nicolás Rodríguez , had been ordered to harass the Texian troops at Goliad . Rodríguez took the bulk of his men on an expedition ; while they were gone , Westover 's force arrived in San Patricio . On November 3 , a local man persuaded the Mexican garrison to surrender , and the following day the Texians dismantled the fort . Rodríguez returned as the Texians were crossing the swollen Nueces River to return to Goliad . The Mexican soldiers attacked , but the longer range of the Texians rifles soon forced them to retreat . One Texian was injured , 3 – 5 Mexican soldiers were killed , and 14 – 17 were wounded . 
 The injured Mexican troops were allowed to seek medical treatment in San Patricio , and the remaining Mexican soldiers retreated to Matamoros . The Texians now had full control of the Texas Gulf Coast , which meant that the troops stationed at San Antonio de Béxar could only receive reinforcements and supplies overland . Historian Bill Groneman believes that this contributed to the eventual Mexican defeat at the siege of Béxar , which expelled all Mexican troops from Texas . The former site of the fort is now a Texas historic site . 
 = = Background = = 
 Fort Lipantitlán was built on the grounds of an old campsite along the west bank of the Nueces River on the Gulf coast of Texas . The site was first occupied by a nomadic Lipan Apache tribe during their periodic visits . After the Apaches abandoned the area , the campground was often used by missionaries , military units , and traders making their way between Mexico and the Texas settlements . In 1825 or 1826 , Mexican officials constructed a makeshift fort , named Lipantitlán after the Lipan Apaches , at the campsite . According to Texian John J. Linn , the fort " was a single embankment of earth , lined within by fence rails to hold the dirt in place , and would have answered tolerably well , perhaps , for a second @-@ rate hog pen " . The embankment was surrounded by a large ditch ; just outside the ditch lay adobe and wooden huts for the officers and their families . 
 Between 80 and 125 soldiers from the 2nd Active ( Cavalry ) Company of Tamaulipas were garrisoned at the fort . They collected customs duties and provided protection to San Patricio , a small settlement of Irish and Mexican colonists approximately 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) south . Smaller garrisons were located at Copano Bay and Refugio , with a larger force stationed at Presidio La Bahía in Goliad . 
 In 1835 , federalists in several interior Mexican states revolted against the increasingly centralist reign of Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna . The Texians staged a minor revolt against customs duties in June , and wary colonists soon began forming militias , ostensibly to protect themselves . Fearing that strong measures were needed to quell the unrest , Santa Anna ordered General Martín Perfecto de Cos to lead a large force into Texas ; Cos arrived in Texas on September 20 . 
 The Texas Revolution officially began on October 2 at the Battle of Gonzales . Within days , Texian insurgents seized Presidio La Bahía , located at Goliad . Twenty Mexican soldiers escaped and briefly took refuge at Copano and Refugio ; those garrisons soon abandoned their posts and joined the larger force at Fort Lipantitlán . The Mexican soldiers at Lipantitlán began improving the defenses of their small fort . As the only remaining garrison on the Texas coast , Fort Lipantitlán was a vital link between the Mexican interior and Béxar , the political center of Texas which housed Cos and the only other force of Mexican troops in Texas . 
 Captain Philip Dimmitt assumed command of the Texians at Presidio La Bahía . In a letter to General Stephen F. Austin dated October 15 , Dimmitt proposed an attack on Fort Lipantitlán , whose capture would " secure the frontier , provide a vital station for defense , create instability among the centralists , and encourage Mexican federalists " . Most of the federalists in San Patricio were afraid of retaliation if they openly defied Santa Anna 's centralist policies . They were also reluctant to hold elections for delegates to the Consultation , which would decide whether Texians were fighting for reinstatement of the Constitution of 1824 or for independence from Mexico . Soldiers at Lipantitlán had also imprisoned two of Dimmitt 's men , John Williams and John Toole , as they tried to deliver missives to the federalist leaders in San Patricio on October 10 and 11 . Dimmitt hoped to free the men after capturing Fort Lipantitlán . 
 On October 20 , James Power , one of the Irish empresarios who had helped to found San Patricio , learned that the Lipantitlán soldiers had been ordered to retake Presidio La Bahia . Two hundred cavalry were expected to reinforce the Lipantitlán garrison before the attack , with an additional 200 – 300 soldiers expected later . Although Dimmitt forwarded the intelligence to Austin , he was not given authorization to attack . The delay proved costly to Williams and Toole , who were marched to the Mexican interior , beyond the reach of the Texians . According to Dimmitt 's angry letter to Austin , Toole begged his captors to kill him outright rather than send him on the march , which he believed would still result in his death . Dimmitt concluded , " this news , after the leniency shown to the prisoners taken here , could not fail to create a lively , and a strong excitement . The men under my command are clamorous for retaliation " . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 The furor over the removal of Williams and Toole likely led Dimmitt to take matters into his own hands . On October 31 he sent a member of his staff , Adjutant Ira Westover , to take 35 men to attack Fort Lipantitlán . A self @-@ appointed advisory committee — John J. Linn , Major James Kerr and Power — rode along . The three advisors had been elected to the Consultation but delayed their departure so that they could participate in the fighting . 
 Rather than riding directly southwest to the fort , Westover travelled southeast to Refugio . This alternative route was likely intended to suggest that the expedition was headed for Copano Bay . An unknown number of men joined the expedition in Refugio ; historian Craig <unk> believes that the expedition grew by at least 20 men , and historian Bill Groneman estimated that Westover 's force numbered 60 – 70 men when it reached San Patricio . 
 Meanwhile , the commander of the garrison at Fort Lipantitlán , Captain Nicolás Rodríguez , received orders to harass the Texians at Presidio La Bahía . On October 31 , as Rodríguez and his men neared Goliad , they learned that a Texian force had left the fort earlier that day . The Mexican soldiers immediately retraced their route . They did not encounter any Texian soldiers during their march and arrived on November 1 to find the fort unmolested . Uncertain as to what the Texians intended to do , Rodríguez and the bulk of his garrison ( almost 80 men ) turned back towards Goliad to attempt to intercept the Texians . Between 21 and 27 soldiers , armed with two cannon , remained to defend the fort . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Rodríguez expected the Texians to take a direct <unk> his men patrolled the northern approaches to the fort . Westover 's men instead approached from the east , eluding the Mexican patrols . Five miles ( 8 km ) from San Patricio , Westover received word that Rodríguez was searching for the Texians . He forced the men to increase their pace , and they arrived at San Patricio 30 minutes after sundown on November 3 . Westover positioned two small groups of men to guard the Nueces River crossings , about 70 yards ( 64 m ) from the fort . As the rest of the Texians prepared for a dawn assault , two San Patricio residents wandered into their camp . Westover arrested one of them , James O 'Riley , for " aiding and assisting the enemy " . In exchange for his liberty , O 'Riley offered to persuade the Mexican garrison to surrender . Historians have no records of what methods O 'Riley used , but by 11 pm the Mexican soldiers had surrendered , without a shot fired . They were released immediately as long as they promised not to fight again during the Texas Revolution . The Texians captured the two 4 @-@ lb ( 1 @.@ 8 @-@ kg ) cannons , 18 muskets , and 3 – 4 pounds ( 1 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 8 kg ) of powder . They also released several Texians who had been held prisoner in the fort . 
 The following day , Texians burned the wooden huts adjacent to the fort and dismantled the embankments . By 3 pm they had rounded up 14 horses and were preparing to bring the cannons back to Goliad . In the meantime , Rodriguez had travelled almost all the way to Goliad . Before he reached Presidio La Bahía , one of his spies arrived with news that the Texians had taken Fort Lipantitlán . Rodriguez and his men — including 10 colonists from San Patricio — marched back toward the fort , arriving at about 4 pm . 
 The Texians used a small canoe to transport men across the Nueces River , and when the Mexican soldiers were sighted only half of the Texian force had crossed to the east bank of the river . As the Mexican soldiers attacked , the Texians took cover in a grove of trees . The trees prevented the cavalry from approaching , so Rodriguez 's men dismounted and attempted to attack from both sides . The Texian rifles had a much longer range than the Mexican Brown Bess muskets — 200 yards ( 180 m ) compared to 70 yards ( 64 m ) . After 30 minutes of fighting , the Mexicans withdrew , leaving behind 8 horses and several wounded men . The only Texian injured was Lieutenant William Bracken , who lost three fingers . Texian rifleman A. J. Jones later wrote to Fannin that 3 Mexicans had died with 14 wounded , though historian Stephen Hardin believes that 5 Mexicans died with 17 wounded . Jones 's letter mentioned that three of the wounded were the alcalde , judge , and sheriff of San Patricio . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Without draft animals , the Texians had no easy way to transport the artillery . As night approached , a cold rain began to fall , and the men became discouraged . Westover , Kerr , Linn , and Power agreed to throw the artillery in the river rather than continue to struggle with it . The Texians also deposited their cache of captured ammunition and muskets in the river ; in their opinion , the supplies were useless . 
 Most Texians spent the night in San Patricio , housed by sympathetic locals . The Mexican troops camped outdoors near the battle site . At dawn , Westover agreed to allow the wounded Mexican soldiers to be transported to San Patricio for treatment . The following day one of the wounded soldiers , Mexican Lieutenant Marcellino Garcia , died . Garcia was a personal friend of Linn , and the Texians gave him a full burial with honors . 
 Westover sent a messenger to Rodríguez to request " another pleasant meeting " . Rodríguez declined the offer and retreated with his remaining men to Matamoros . Their departure left only one remaining group of Mexican soldiers in Texas , those under General Cos at Béxar . The Texians now controlled the Gulf Coast , and so all communication between Cos and the Mexican interior must be transferred overland . The long distance involved severely slowed the delivery of messages and receipt of supplies and reinforcements . According to Groneman , this likely contributed to Cos 's defeat in the siege of Béxar , which expelled the remaining Mexican soldiers from Texas . 
 On their return to Goliad , Westover 's group encountered Agustín Viesca , the recently deposed governor of Coahuila y Tejas . Several months before , Viesca had been imprisoned by the Mexican army for defying attempts by Santa Anna to disband the state legislature . He and members of his cabinet had been liberated by sympathetic soldiers and immediately travelled to Texas to recreate the state government . Westover and his men provided a military escort to Goliad , arriving on November 12 . Dimmitt welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize his authority as governor . This caused an uproar in the garrison ; many supported the governor , while others believed that Texas should be an independent country and should therefore not recognize the Mexican governor . 
 Dimmitt later chastised Westover for not following orders during the expedition . Westover refused to make an official report to Dimmitt . Instead , he sent a written report to Sam Houston , the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the regular army . In Westover 's opinion , " The men all fought bravely and those on the opposite bank of the river were enabled to operate on the flanks of the enemy above and below the crossing which they did with fine effect . " Houston lauded " the conduct and bravery of the officers and men who have so handsomely acquitted themselves in the affair and so deservedly won [ a ] reputation for themselves and Glory for their Country " . This was the first armed skirmish fought since the Battle of Goliad , according to historian Hobart Huson , the victory " renewed the morale of the people " . News of the battle spread throughout the United States , and the Texians were widely praised in American newspapers . 
 The removal of Mexican army oversight encouraged federalists in San Patricio . These men soon gained control of the municipal government , formed a militia , and elected delegates to represent them at the Consultation . However , the town remained divided ; many still supported the centralist Mexican government . After reaching Matamoros , Rodríguez sent a letter to the town leaders . The letter warned that the Mexican army would return and encouraged the people of San Patricio to repudiate the rebellion . One of the San Patricio federalists later wrote Dimmitt , " We have neither men nor means to withstand any force that may be sent against us . " The Texians chose not to garrison men in or near San Patricio . In 1836 , as part of Santa Anna 's invasion of Texas , General José de Urrea led Mexican forces along the Texas coastline and retook San Patricio on February 27 . 
 In 1937 , the land comprising the former site of Fort Lipantitlán was donated to the state of Texas . The Texas State Parks Board gained control over the site in 1949 . Now named the <unk> State Historic Site , the park covers 5 acres ( 2 @.@ 0 ha ) in Nueces County . A stone marker indicates the location of the former fort . 
 = Elizabeth Needham = 
 Elizabeth Needham ( died 3 May 1731 ) , also known as Mother Needham , was an English <unk> and brothel @-@ keeper of 18th @-@ century London , who has been identified as the bawd greeting Moll Hackabout in the first plate of William Hogarth 's series of satirical etchings , A Harlot 's Progress . Although Needham was notorious in London at the time , little is recorded of her life , and no genuine portraits of her survive . Her house was the most exclusive in London and her customers came from the highest strata of fashionable society , but she eventually ran afoul of the moral reformers of the day and died as a result of the severe treatment she received after being sentenced to stand in the pillory . 
 = = Character = = 
 Nothing is known of Needham 's early life , but by the time she was middle @-@ aged she was renowned in London as the keeper of a brothel in Park Place , St. James . Her house was regarded as the most exclusive in London , superior to those of Covent Garden , even to that of the other notorious bawd of the time , Mother <unk> . She was said to still be attractive in middle @-@ age ; Hogarth described her as a " handsome old Procuress ... well dressed in silk " , but mentions " patches on her face " and in his picture her face is seen to be pock @-@ marked . She went by a number of aliases : Bird , Howard , Blewitt and Trent are among those ascribed to her , although Mother Bird was also the name of another brothel @-@ keeper who was committed to Newgate Prison with Needham in 1724 . Needham was apparently ruthless with the girls and women who worked for her . They were forced to hire their dresses from her , and , if they were unable to pay the exorbitant rentals , she would force them to take more customers or have them committed to debtors ' prison until they met her demands ( a scheme John Cleland 's heroine falls prey to in Fanny Hill ( 1748 ) ) . Once they were too old or too ill to attract customers , she would throw them out . 
 Needham procured her prostitutes from many sources including the houses of other brothel @-@ keepers , the " <unk> " in Covent Garden where homeless girls would sleep rough , Tom King 's Coffee House , and , it appears , from auctions , but , as depicted in Hogarth 's picture , she particularly targeted girls and women fresh from the country . The essayist Richard Steele found her pitching to a newly arrived girl when he went to meet a wagon bringing him items from the countryside . He described her as " artful " , and it seems that she was friendly and engaging with her potential employees , revealing her vicious character only when they were under her roof ; in The Dunciad , Alexander Pope warns not to " ... lard your words with Mother Needham 's style " . Pope mentions her once more at the end of The Dunciad ( 1728 ) , making reference to her foul mouth , and again , alongside other notorious madams of the day , in the last verses of his Coronation Epistle ( which were suppressed in editions of the poem from 1769 until 1954 ) : 
 For Want of you , we spend our random Wit on 
 The first we find with Needham , Brooks , or Briton . 
 Henry Fielding refers to her in his Pasquin ( 1736 ) and used Hogarth 's representation of her as the model for Mother Punchbowl in The Covent Garden Tragedy ( 1732 ) . Mary Davys 's bawd in the Accomplish 'd Rake of 1727 is called " Mother N @-@ d @-@ m " and targets young girls fresh from the countryside , just as Needham did . 
 = = Customers = = 
 Chief among her customers were Colonel Francis Charteris and his cousin the Duke of Wharton — Charteris is lounging in the doorway behind Needham in Hogarth 's picture . Ronald Paulson suggests that the model for Moll Hackabout in Hogarth 's first scene is Ann Bond , who was lured by Needham and raped by Charteris . Charteris , already known as the " Rape @-@ Master General " , was convicted and sentenced to death as a result of the Bond rape , although he was later pardoned . Needham 's name was not mentioned during the legal proceedings . 
 Needham may have introduced Charteris to Sally Salisbury around 1708 . Salisbury was the pre @-@ eminent prostitute of the day and was kept by Charteris for a short time as mistress at the beginning of her career . When her previous bawd , Mother <unk> , died in 1719 , she became a member of Needham 's household and brought with her a clientele from the highest ranks of society . Salisbury brought further fame to Needham 's house by involving another of her girls in the theft of the Earl of Cardigan 's clothes . The two women accompanied him to Newmarket where he became drunk , and after putting him to bed at an inn they stole his clothes and jewellery and returned to London . The Earl treated the matter as a joke . 
 Some idea of the reputation of Needham 's house can be gathered from one of Joe Miller 's <unk> , which involves her asking her landlord to wait for his money until Parliament and the Convocation sit , at which point she will be able to pay him ten times over , and by a satirical premature obituary , which appeared in the London Journal . The latter describes a will in which she distributes appropriate gifts to her famous clients : " a picture of Sodom and Gomorrah to <unk> D ― n ; an ounce of <unk> <unk> to Beau C ― e , of St. Martin 's Lane ; her estate to the Duke of Wharton ; her library to Ned C ― ; and a receipt to cure a clap to little <unk> " . At the time , the figures mentioned would not have been spared their blushes by the omission of their full names , but identifying them now is guesswork . 
 Her well @-@ connected clientele may have allowed her to escape arrest . Despite the popular notion that Sally Salisbury 's 1723 stabbing of John Finch , the son of the Duchess of Winchelsea , had taken place in her house ( it had actually occurred at the Three Tuns Tavern in Covent Garden ) , the first time Needham was raided was in 1724 : 
 Yesterday morning the celebrated Mother Needham and Mother Bird , two eminent conservators of the Game of the Kingdom , were committed to Newgate ; their houses being disturb 'd the night before by the Constables , who disengaged the Gentlemen and Ladies to a great number , and carried them to the Round @-@ House . This being the first time Mrs Needham ever received publick correction , since her being at the head of venal affairs in this town , ' tis thought will be the ruin of her household . Daily Journal , Tuesday 21 July 1724 . 
 The constables had found " two women in bed with two men of distinction " . The men were bound over , but the women were sent to Tothill Fields Bridewell to do hard labour . Needham 's punishment on this occasion is not recorded , but it appears that she was still incarcerated in September when her house burned down , killing one of the inhabitants , Captain <unk> , a French officer . In 1728 , several of her girls were arrested , but she appears to have escaped punishment . 
 = = Arrest , conviction and death = = 
 In late 1730 , Sir John Gonson , a Justice of the Peace and fervent supporter of the Society for the Reformation of Manners , spurred on by the furore surrounding the Charteris rape case , began conducting raids on brothels all over London . By early 1731 he had arrived at St James , where some residents of Park Place reported " a Notorious Disorderly House in that Neighbourhood " . In truth , Needham 's house was hardly unknown , having served the upper echelons of society for years , but she was arrested by Gonson and committed to the Gatehouse by Justice Railton . 
 On 29 April 1731 , Needham was convicted of keeping a disorderly house , fined one shilling , and sentenced to stand twice in the pillory , and " to find sureties for her good behaviour for 3 years " . On 30 April she was taken to the pillory near Park Place to stand for the first time . Perhaps because of her connections , she was allowed to lie face down in front of the pillory and a number of guards were paid to protect her . Despite this she received such a pelting that it was thought likely she would die before her punishment was completed . The crowds that had gathered to see her pilloried were so large that one boy fell on an iron fencing rail while trying to get a better look and was killed . 
 Needham was taken from the pillory alive , but died on 3 May 1731 , the day before she was due to stand in the pillory ( this time at New Palace Yard ) for the second time . With her last words she apparently expressed great fear at having to stand in the pillory again after the severe punishment she had received the first time . The Grub Street Journal , the satirical journal allied with Alexander Pope and others of Hogarth 's friends , sardonically reported that the populace " acted very <unk> , considering how much she had done to oblige them " . Her demise was celebrated in a mocking rhyme : 
 Ye Ladies of Drury , now weep 
 Your voices in howling now raise 
 For Old Mother Needham 's laid deep 
 And bitter will be all your Days . 
 She who drest you in <unk> so fine 
 Who trained you up for the Game 
 Who Bail , on occasion would find 
 And keep you from Dolly and Shame 
 Now is laid low in her Grave ... 
 Hogarth was still at work on A Harlot 's Progress when she died , so she never saw herself immortalised . There were other madams ready to step into her shoes , but it was not until Mother Douglas took over the King 's Head in Covent Garden in 1741 that a brothel reappeared with a reputation to match that of Needham . 
 = Maurice Clemmons = 
 Maurice Clemmons ( February 6 , 1972 – December 1 , 2009 ) was an American who was responsible for the November 29 , 2009 , murder of four police officers in Parkland , Washington . After evading police for two days following the shooting , Clemmons was shot and killed by a police officer in Seattle . 
 Prior to his involvement in the shooting , Clemmons had at least five felony convictions in Arkansas and at least eight felony charges in Washington . His first incarceration began in 1989 , at age 17 . Facing sentences totaling 108 years in prison , the burglary sentences were reduced in 2000 by Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee to 47 years , which made him immediately eligible for parole . The Arkansas Parole Board unanimously moved to release him in 2000 . Clemmons was subsequently arrested on other charges and was jailed several times . In the months prior to the Parkland shooting , he was in jail on charges of assaulting a police officer and raping a child . One week prior to the Parkland shooting , he was released from jail after posting a $ 150 @,@ 000 bail bond . 
 Clemmons ' murder of four police officers represented the largest number of law enforcement officers killed by one man in a single incident in U.S. history until July 7 , 2016 . The Dallas , Texas shootings resulted in the deaths of five police officers . 
 = = Early life and crimes = = 
 Maurice Clemmons 's father made frames for automobile seats at a Chrysler factory , and his mother , Dorothy Mae Clemmons , worked in a nursing home . He had five siblings . Clemmons lived in Marianna , Arkansas in his early youth , and moved to Little Rock as a teen . He was arrested when he was a junior at Hall High School for carrying a .25 @-@ caliber pistol on school property . He claimed to be carrying the gun because he was " beaten by dopers " , and said he had " something for them " if they attacked him again . Clemmons did not return to school , and finished his education at eleventh grade . In 1989 , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Clemmons and two other accomplices robbed a woman at midnight in the parking lot of a Little Rock hotel bar . Clemmons pretended to have a gun in his pocket and threatened to shoot her if she did not give him her purse . When she responded , " Well , why don 't you just shoot ? " , he punched her in the head and ran off with the purse , which contained $ 16 and a credit card . 
 Clemmons was accused multiple times of displaying violent behavior during court appearances . In one incident , he dismantled a metal door stop and hid it in his sock to use as a weapon . It was discovered and confiscated by a court bailiff . In another incident , he took a lock from his holding cell and threw it at a bailiff , but missed and accidentally hit his mother instead . Clemmons was once accused of reaching for a guard 's pistol while being transported to court . During one trial , he was shackled in leg irons and seated next to a uniformed officer because the presiding judge ordered extra security , claiming Clemmons had threatened him . At age 16 , Clemmons ' charges were committed from juvenile court to adult court due to the extremely violent nature of his crimes and demeanor . 
 By 1990 , Clemmons was sentenced to 108 years in prison for eight felony charges from his teenage years in Arkansas . The total prison term stemmed from multiple sentences , some of which were concurrent to others and some were consecutive . The largest sentencing came in 1990 , when he was given a 60 @-@ year prison term for breaking into an Arkansas state trooper 's home and stealing about $ 6 @,@ 700 @-@ worth of items , including a gun . 
 During his sentencing on the charges , a circuit judge told Clemmons that he had broken his mother 's heart , to which he responded , " I have broken my own heart . " Clemmons was sentenced in 1989 to 35 years in prison for robbing the woman in front of the Little Rock hotel bar . Among his other sentences were six years for weapon possession based on his high school arrest ; and eight years for burglary , theft and probation in Pulaski County on September 9 , 1989 . He was ineligible for parole until 2015 or later . He was originally held at the Tucker Correctional Facility in Tucker , Arkansas , but was eventually transferred to the Cummins Unit near Grady . 
 = = Clemency = = 
 In 1999 , after having served 10 years of his sentence , Clemmons filed a clemency appeal with Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee . 
 In his petition to Huckabee , Clemmons wrote he came from " a very good Christian family " and was " raised much better than my actions speak " . Clemmons claimed he had just moved from Seattle , Washington , to Arkansas as a teenager , and because he had no friends he gave in to peer pressure and " fell in with the wrong crowd " to be accepted by his young peers , which led him to commit his crimes . Although he apologized for his actions , Clemmons also complained that he received overly harsh sentences . He also claimed to have changed and expressed regret that his mother had recently died without seeing him turn his life around . Clemmons ' clemency application was supported by Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Marion Humphrey , who argued the cumulative sentence was excessive and cited Clemmons ' young age at the time he committed the crimes . 
 The decision was made over the objections of some victims and prosecutors involved in Clemmons ' previous cases but was supported by the bipartisan parole board and the trial court judge in Clemmons ' case . Mark Fraiser , an attorney who prosecuted early cases against Clemmons in Pulaski County , argued Clemmons was extremely likely to commit further acts of violence in the future , and said for a teen to receive such a lengthy prison sentence without committing a murder , " you 've got to be a bad little dude " . On May 3 , 2000 , Huckabee commuted Clemmons ' 108 @-@ year sentence to 47 years , 5 months and 19 days , which made him eligible for parole that day . As a factor in his decision , Huckabee cited the unusually long sentence for Clemmons ' age at the time the crimes were committed . The Arkansas Parole Board unanimously approved Clemmons ' release on July 13 , 2000 , and he was set free on August 1 , 2000 . 
 = = Later crimes = = 
 In March 2001 , Clemmons violated parole by committing aggravated robbery and theft again in Ouachita County . He was convicted on July 13 , 2001 and sentenced to 10 years in prison . He faced charges of parole violations , but due to problems with the case , he was not served with the charges until 2004 . His attorney argued the parole violation charges should be dropped because so much time had passed , and they were subsequently dismissed . Clemmons was granted parole on the robbery charges in 2004 . He told the parole board he was " not ready " the first time he was released , but that he " doesn 't want to die in prison " and will " try to do the right thing " . Clemmons moved to Washington in 2004 while still on parole , which was approved by Arkansas authorities . That year , he married a woman named Nicole Smith , although The Seattle Times later reported the relationship had " been tumultuous " . He was placed under the supervision of the Washington State Department of Corrections and classified as " high risk to <unk> " . His supervision was to continue until October 2015 . He lived in Tacoma , where he ran a landscaping and power @-@ washing business out of his house . Over the next five years , Clemmons bought six houses , including one in Arkansas and five in Washington . 
 Following his parole in 2004 , Clemmons had no arrests or problems with the law until May 2009 . The Seattle Times referred to four days in May 2009 as the time when " Maurice Clemmons ' behavior and mental state deteriorated " . On May 9 , a Pierce County sheriff 's deputy responded to Clemmons ' home after reports he was throwing rocks at houses , cars and people . When the deputy tried to enter the house , one of Clemmons ' cousins grabbed his wrist . After a struggle , Clemmons emerged from the house and punched the deputy in the face , and assaulted a second deputy who arrived to help . Clemmons was placed under arrest and taken to Pierce County Jail , where he continued to struggle and told jail workers , " I 'll kill all you bitches . " He was charged with two felony assault charges and two felony malicious mischief charges , and released from jail the next day after posting a $ 40 @,@ 000 bail bond without seeing a judge . 
 On May 11 , around 1 a.m. , Clemmons appeared naked in his living room and ordered two female relatives , ages 11 and 12 , to fondle him . The two reportedly complied out of fear , and the 11 @-@ year @-@ old fled the house afterward . Clemmons took the 12 @-@ year @-@ old into his bedroom along with Clemmons ' wife . Clemmons repeatedly referred to himself as Jesus , and said his wife was Eve . He released the 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl after his wife begged him to let her go . However , around 4 a.m. that same morning , he gathered his family back into the living room and demanded they strip naked together . He later left the house , claiming the world was coming to an end and that he was " going to fly to heaven " . A family member called 911 and police found Clemmons at a nearby second house he was building , but Clemmons fled on foot and escaped . He failed to appear the next day for an arraignment on his May 9 charges . Child Protective Services investigated and substantiated the sexual abuse complaint . <unk> Clemmons , Clemmons 's sister , told authorities he had undergone a change and was " not in his right mind " . 
 Clemmons was arrested on July 1 , 2009 , after he appeared in a Pierce County court trying to have his bench warrant thrown out . He was charged with second @-@ degree rape of a child , as well as being a fugitive from Arkansas . At the time of his arrest , Clemmons made religiously themed comments and referred to himself as " the beast " . He also told a police officer that President Barack Obama and LeBron James were his brothers , and Oprah Winfrey was his sister . Pierce County prosecutors asserted that Clemmons ' recent crimes amounted to a violation of Clemmons ' parole in Arkansas , and that he faced years in prison if he was returned to the state . However , the Arkansas Department of Community Correction notified Pierce County on July 22 that they did not intend to ask for his extradition and that he should be adjudicated on his Washington charges . Stephen Penner , a deputy prosecuting attorney in Pierce County , said of the Arkansas decision , " There 's a built @-@ in incentive to not following through . In a way , the more violent they are , the less you want them in your community . " 
 During a court @-@ ordered mental health evaluation , Clemmons told psychologists he had experienced hallucinations in May 2009 of " people drinking blood and people eating babies , and lawless on the streets , like people were cannibals " . He claimed the visions had since passed . He also claimed to have no faith in the American justice system and thought he was being " maliciously persecuted because I 'm black and they believe the police " . The evaluation , completed by two psychologists from the Western State Hospital on October 19 , concluded Clemmons was dangerous and presented an increased risk of future criminal acts . Pierce County Judge John McCarthy set bail for Clemmons ' assault charges at $ 40 @,@ 000 , considerably below the $ 100 @,@ 000 prosecutors sought based on Clemmons ' history of violence . Pierce County Judge Thomas <unk> set bail for the child @-@ rape charges at $ 150 @,@ 000 , lower than the $ 200 @,@ 000 sought by prosecutors , but higher than usual for the charges . 
 After a mental evaluation , a psychologist concluded Clemmons was competent to stand trial on the charges , which eliminated him as a candidate for involuntary commitment . An attorney for Clemmons notified the court he planned to pursue an insanity or diminished @-@ capacity defense . On November 23 , 2009 , Clemmons paid $ 15 @,@ 000 for a $ 190 @,@ 000 bail bond from Jail Sucks Bail Bonds , a Chehalis @-@ based company , to secure his release . Two other bail bond agencies had rejected Clemmons based on his history of failing to appear in court . 
 = = 2009 police officer shooting = = 
 Clemmons failed to check in with his community corrections officer within 24 hours of his release as required , but nothing was done in response . On November 26 , 2009 , less than one week after Clemmons posted his bail bond , during a Thanksgiving gathering at the home of Clemmons ' aunt , Clemmons told several people he was angry about his Pierce County legal problems and that he planned to use a gun to murder police officers and others , including school children . He showed a gun to the people in the room and told them he had two others in his car and home . Clemmons said he planned to activate an alarm by removing a court @-@ ordered ankle monitor , then he would shoot the police officers who responded to his house . In describing the planned murder , Clemmons said , " Knock , knock , knock , boom ! " 
 Darcus Allen , a convicted murderer who previously served in a Arkansas prison with Clemmons , was allegedly present for the conversation . Also on Thanksgiving , Clemmons cut off a GPS monitor Jail Sucks Bail Bonds had secured onto his ankle . On November 28 , Clemmons showed two handguns to friends Eddie and Douglas Davis and told them he planned to shoot police officers with them ; the exchange was witnessed by Clemmons ' half @-@ brother Rickey Hinton , with whom he shared a house . During the exchange , Clemmons danced around with the guns in his hands , claiming to be Lucifer . He told the men he had twice tried to go to a Tacoma police station , where he planned to walk in and start shooting . The first time the station was closed , and the second time he got a flat tire on the way there , Clemmons claimed . He talked about stopping at a crowded intersection or a school and shooting people there . 
 On the morning of November 29 , Clemmons drove a white pickup truck to Allen 's home , then Allen drove him past the Forza Coffee Co. coffee shop in Parkland , Washington , a suburb of Tacoma . After they saw marked police patrol cars in the parking lot , Allen drove back past the coffee shop and parked nearby . Some reports from witnesses said Clemmons parked his truck in a car wash north of the coffee shop and pretended to clean the vehicle , but never turned the hose on . Around 8 a.m , Clemmons walked into the Forza Coffee Co. coffee shop , where four police officers were working on laptops before their shift . Clemmons opened fire on the officers , shooting them to death . 
 Investigators said the murders were a targeted , execution @-@ style attack and not associated with a robbery ; Clemmons did not aim at any other customers or the two <unk> working at the time . The four slain officers were Mark <unk> , 39 ( killed with a shot to the head ) ; Ronald Owens , 37 ( shot in the neck ) ; Tina Griswold , 40 ( shot in the head ) ; and Greg Richards , 42 ( shot in the head ) . 
 As Clemmons fled , Officer Richards struggled with him in the restaurant 's doorway , then shot Clemmons in the back before the officer succumbed to a bullet wound to his head . The shooter stole Richards ' Glock pistols before escaping . Clemmons returned to the truck and Allen drove him away . Allen later told detectives he stopped at an intersection and abandoned Clemmons and the truck , claiming he " wants of no part of this " . Authorities however , later disputed this claim and said there was no evidence Allen abandoned the vehicle . Clemmons was identified later that day as a " person of interest " in the murders , but soon after was identified as a wanted suspect . Police identified no motive for the murders , and Detective Ed Troyer , Pierce County Sheriff ’ s Office spokesman , said , " We 're going to be surprised if there is a motive worth mentioning . " Police initially believed the suspect might have died from his injuries shortly after the shooting . 
 Clemmons went back to his house and told Hinton he had been shot by police , and Hinton allegedly gave Eddie and Douglas Davis a car to " get Clemmons out of here " . As they drove , Clemmons told the brothers he " had taken care of his business " . The Davis brothers took Clemmons to other friends , who bandaged his wounds . Later that day , police received a tip that Clemmons was seeking shelter from friends in Seattle . Police pulled over a white car they believed to have been transporting him , and the female driver admitted Clemmons was a friend and she had brought him to Seattle after he told her " he had killed a police officer or officers " . 
 Coffee shop employees who witnessed the shooting identified Clemmons as the shooter from a series of photos . Authorities sought him in what was considered one of the biggest manhunts the Seattle @-@ Tacoma area had ever seen , and Clemmons was considered the most wanted man in the Pacific Northwest . Authorities also surrounded the homes of Clemmons ' friends and family in order to prevent him from finding shelter , and to determine who was helping him . A Clemmons relative learned that Clemmons was coming to her home in the Leschi neighborhood in Seattle , informed the police and fled . Police locked down the house for 11 hours in the early morning of November 30 , believing Clemmons to be holed up inside . After several attempts to coax or force him out of the house , including use of a robot and <unk> grenades , police entered and discovered Clemmons was not inside . Later that day , police searched multiple locations in the Seattle and Tacoma areas , including a park where they found a handgun carried by Clemmons and his pickup truck , which had blood stains inside . 
 = = Death = = 
 On December 1 , 2009 , Clemmons was shot and killed by Seattle police officer Benjamin L. Kelly . Around 2 : 45 a.m. , Kelly was on patrol and stopped to investigate a broken @-@ down car on the side of the road , which was idling with its hood up . Kelly recognized the vehicle as having been reported stolen . While sitting in his patrol car and writing a report , Kelly noticed Clemmons approaching him and recognized him as the suspect in the Lakewood shooting . Kelly ordered him to stop and show his hands , but he instead began to flee around the disabled vehicle . Police claim that Clemmons reached into his waist area for a gun . Kelly fired several rounds at Clemmons and hit him at least twice , killing him . Clemmons was carrying a handgun that had belonged to Lakewood Officer Greg Richards . Kelly was placed on routine administrative leave following the shooting . Police later said Clemmons would have eventually died from the gunshot wound he sustained at the Lakewood shooting . 
 Since his death , multiple people have been arrested for helping Clemmons during and after the Lakewood shooting . Authorities claim the accomplices misled police about his whereabouts , gave him cell phones and money , applied first aid to his gunshot wounds and tried to help him leave the state . Among those arrested were Clemmons ' sister , who bandaged his wounds and provided him transportation . Authorities arrested five other people for assisting Clemmons : <unk> Nelson , Quiana Williams , Douglas Davis , Eddie Davis , and Ricky Hinton . Darcus Allen was arrested and charged with aggravated first @-@ degree murder for his alleged role as Clemmons ' getaway driver . Allen claims he did not know Clemmons ' plans when he drove him to the coffee shop , but authorities argued he had known for days that Clemmons planned to murder police officers . 
 A cell phone photograph taken of Clemmons ' shirtless dead body quickly spread among city residents and government employees , prompting questions over who took it and how it became circulated . If the photo was leaked by an employee of the city or emergency responder , the action may possibly violate their employment contract . Funeral arrangements were kept private by the family due to the circumstances of his crime . 
 = Hurricane Juan ( 1985 ) = 
 Hurricane Juan was a large and erratic tropical cyclone that looped twice near the Louisiana coast , causing widespread flooding . It was the tenth named storm of the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season , forming in the central Gulf of Mexico in late October . Juan moved northward after its formation , and was subtropical in nature with its large size . On October 27 , the storm became a hurricane , reaching maximum sustained winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . Due to the influence of an upper @-@ level low , Juan looped just off southern Louisiana before making landfall near Morgan City on October 29 . Weakening to tropical storm status over land , Juan turned back to the southeast over open waters , crossing the Mississippi River Delta . After turning to the northeast , the storm made its final landfall just west of Pensacola , Florida , late on October 31 . Juan continued quickly to the north and was absorbed by an approaching cold front , although its moisture contributed to a deadly flood event in the Mid @-@ Atlantic states . 
 Juan was the last of three hurricanes to move over Louisiana during the season , after Danny in August and Elena in early September . It formed rapidly in the northern Gulf of Mexico , allowing little time for thorough preparations or the evacuation of offshore oil rigs . As a result , nine people died in maritime accidents off Louisiana . Onshore , the hurricane dropped torrential rain totaling 17 @.@ 78 in ( 452 mm ) in Galliano , Louisiana . The combination of the rainfall and a high storm surge flooded 50 @,@ 000 houses and many communities in southern Louisiana , causing extensive agriculture losses . Damage in Louisiana alone approached $ 1 billion ( 1985 USD ) . Elsewhere , flooding in Texas forced the closure of roadways , while heavy rains damaged crops and houses in southern Mississippi . The outer rainbands of Juan spawned 15 tornadoes along the Florida Panhandle , causing over $ 1 million in damage . Overall , Juan directly inflicted about $ 1 @.@ 5 billion in damage , making it among the costliest United States hurricanes , and there were 12 deaths . This excludes the effects from the subsequent flooding in the Mid @-@ Atlantic . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The interaction between a tropical wave and a upper @-@ level low moving southeastward from Texas spawned a broad trough over the central Gulf of Mexico on October 24 . That day , there was a marked increase in convection , or thunderstorms . At the same time , the pressure gradient between the trough and a high pressure area over the southeastern United States produced winds of near gale force across the northern Gulf of Mexico . Early on October 26 , a tropical depression developed about 380 mi ( 610 km ) south @-@ southwest of New Orleans . Within 12 hours , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Juan , based on satellite imagery and reports from the Hurricane Hunters . Initially , the structure was akin to that of a subtropical cyclone , with light winds near the center . Juan moved erratically at first , eventually tracking more steadily to the north @-@ northeast on October 27 . After turning to the northwest late on October 27 , Juan intensified into a hurricane , with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) , based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters . 
 Under the effects of a larger upper @-@ level low , Juan slowed on October 28 while approaching the Louisiana coastline . At 1200 UTC that day , the hurricane attained peak winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . After executing a loop just offshore southern Louisiana , Juan turned back to the east , making landfall at peak intensity near Morgan City at 1100 UTC on October 29 . Subsequently , Juan turned sharply to the northwest , executing another loop over southern Louisiana near Lafayette . Late on October 29 , the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status , emerging into Vermilion Bay early the next day with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) . Juan turned to the east , moving along the southern Louisiana coast and re @-@ organizing slightly . 
 On October 31 , the storm moved across the Mississippi Delta near Burrwood , Louisiana , and accelerated to the northeast , influenced by an approaching upper @-@ level trough . At 1200 UTC that day , Juan attained a secondary peak of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . In the subsequent six hours , the storm weakened slightly , making its final landfall just west of Pensacola , Florida with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) late on October 31 . After striking Florida , Juan turned to the north and weakened over land . After moving through Alabama , the storm became extratropical over Tennessee on November 1 . Although the Atlantic hurricane best track ceased tracking the circulation at 1800 UTC that day , Juan continued generally northward through the Ohio Valley , and the center eventually crossed into Canada . The energy from Juan helped spawn an occluded low in the Tennessee Valley , which produced more rainfall throughout the region . An approaching cold front absorbed the remnants of Juan on November 3 .

 Before Juan made landfall , about 100 people evacuated around Port Arthur , Texas . In Louisiana , about 6 @,@ 550 people evacuated , including only 700 of the 1 @,@ 900 residents on Grand Isle ; many of those who stayed behind there were trapped after the onslaught of the storm surge . About 6 @,@ 000 people evacuated in Mississippi due to the threat for flooding . Many schools were closed along the coast in Louisiana and Mississippi , and two beaches were closed both sides of the Brownsville , Texas shipping channel . On October 28 , governor Edwin Edwards declared a state of emergency for 13 Louisiana parishes , while officials issued flash flood watches for 42 of Louisiana 's 64 parishes . Governor George Wallace also declared a state of emergency for Alabama , and shelters were opened along the coast . 
 Due to the erratic motion and large size of Juan , tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for large portions of the northern Gulf Coast . Around the time of landfall , hurricane warnings were issued from Port Arthur , Texas to Mobile , Alabama , with gale warnings farther to the east to Apalachicola , Florida and extending to the west to Port O 'Connor , Texas . The storm 's quick development left people generally unprepared . National Hurricane Center forecaster Neil Frank likened Juan to " a spinning top [ that ] will spin around unpredictably and do whatever it wants . " 
 = = Impact = = 
 While on its erratic path off the northern Gulf Coast , Juan killed 12 people , nine of whom offshore due to overturned oil rigs or boats . The hurricane directly caused about $ 1 @.@ 5 billion in damage , making it the fourth costliest United States hurricane at the time without adjusting for inflation ; it was behind only Hurricane Frederic of 1979 , Hurricane Agnes of 1972 , and Hurricane Alicia of 1983 . The damage total included losses to the oil industry , wrecked crops , and overall flooding damage , mostly in Louisiana . According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , Juan injured 1 @,@ 357 people , mostly to a minor extent . Juan struck less than two months after Hurricane Elena hit the northern Gulf Coast , resulting in further damage to already ravaged areas . 
 For about five days , Juan and its precursor produced gale force winds along the northern Gulf of Mexico . The strongest winds in relation to Juan were on offshore oil rigs , with one rig recording peak sustained winds of 92 mph ( 148 km / h ) and gusts to 110 mph ( 176 km / h ) . Juan also produced high waves waves that damaged several rigs , of which two were overturned . One of the rigs collapsed and fell onto an adjacent rig about 35 mi ( 56 km ) south of <unk> , Louisiana amid hurricane @-@ force winds and high seas . The collapsed rigs , built in 1956 and 1961 , were designed to withstand 45 ft ( 14 m ) waves that would accompany a 25 year storm at the time , though Juan produced waves approaching 70 ft ( 21 m ) . The combination of the waves and strong winds in advance of the storm prevented early evacuation of the oil rigs . A boat of evacuees overturned in the midst of the storm , killing one and hospitalizing two others ; the remaining workers were rescued by the United States Coast Guard , and overall the agency rescued at least 160 people . While conducting a search and rescue mission , a boat named Miss Agnes capsized about 60 mi ( 97 km ) south of Grand Isle , Louisiana ; two members of the crew went missing and were presumed killed , and two other occupants were rescued . A <unk> rig capsized near the mouth of the Mississippi River , killing three . A rescue helicopter off the coast of Louisiana caused three severe injuries when the rescue basket blew onto the evacuated oil rig amid strong winds . 
 Because it looped twice near the coastline , Hurricane Juan brought extensive rainfall from eastern Texas to the western Florida Panhandle . In Texas , the highest precipitation total was 12 @.@ 84 in ( 326 mm ) at a station southwest of Alto . The highest rainfall related to Juan in the United States was 17 @.@ 78 in ( 452 mm ) , recorded in Galliano , Louisiana . Farther east , there were more reports of high rainfall , measured at 10 @.@ 52 in ( 267 mm ) and 12 @.@ 23 in ( 311 mm ) in Biloxi , Mississippi and Fairhope , Alabama , respectively . In Florida , the highest rainfall was 11 @.@ 71 in ( 297 mm ) near Pensacola . As well as the heavy rainfall , Juan produced heightened tides along the Gulf Coast , peaking at 8 @.@ 2 ft ( 2 @.@ 5 m ) in Bayou Bienvenue in Louisiana . Tides peaked at around 3 @.@ 3 ft ( 1 m ) in the other coastal states , although offshore winds caused below @-@ normal tides in western Louisiana and Texas after Juan exited the area . The storm also spawned a few tornadoes , most of them weak . Two were in Mississippi , each damaging a mobile home and downing several trees , and at least three occurred in Alabama , causing isolated building and tree damage . 
 Hurricane Juan was one of the latest tropical cyclones in the year to affect Texas . The heavy rainfall from the storm caused flooding in the southeastern portion of the state , primarily in low @-@ lying areas and along bayous . The flooding forced several roads to close , but there was minimal housing damage . Tides reached about 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) above normal near Galveston , causing coastal flooding and closing a portion of Texas State Highway 87 , but little beach erosion . Due to Juan 's structure being closer to a subtropical cyclone than a typical hurricane , it produced strong winds well away from its center , with gusts of 58 mph ( 93 km / h ) reported along the Texas coast . The winds were strong enough to knock down trees and power lines , causing power outages . One person drowned in a boating accident off the Texas coast . 
 In Mississippi , heavy rain from Juan flooded about 340 homes and businesses , mainly in the southern portion of the state . High winds and waves damaged ports in Pass Christian and Long Beach . Several boats were damaged along the coast , and the seafood industry suffered losses . Beach erosion damaged coastal roads , leaving debris and marsh grass behind when the storm passed . The total storm cost in the state was estimated at $ 776 @,@ 000 . In neighboring Alabama , Juan only produced wind gusts of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) , which caused little damage , but the storm 's rainfall contributed to Mobile recording its wettest October on record . The rains caused flooding along streets and low @-@ lying areas , but property generally escaped unscathed . The flooding did cause locally heavy crop damage ; some farmers lost 50 % of their soybean crop , and the pecan crop was damaged after earlier being affected by Hurricane Elena . Damage in the state was minor , estimated at over $ 65 @,@ 000 . 
 Farther east in Florida , high waves caused flooding , beach erosion , and the loss of seawalls previously damaged by Elena . The rough surf washed away a house on Captiva Island . The outskirts of Juan also spawned 15 tornadoes along the Florida Panhandle , causing $ 1 million in damage . The tornadoes injured six people , destroyed 19 buildings , and damaged about 40 others . One of the tornadoes struck Okaloosa Island and Fort Walton Beach , killing a dog and damaging two hotels along U.S. Route 98 .

 Due to the cyclone 's slow movement over Louisiana , it dropped over 10 in ( 250 mm ) of rainfall across much of the southern portion of the state . The intense rainfall increased levels along rivers in southwestern Louisiana . High waves and a storm surge of 5 to 8 ft ( 1 @.@ 5 to 2 @.@ 4 m ) flooded low @-@ lying and coastal areas of southeastern Louisiana . The hurricane 's erratic path prevented farmers from harvesting crops for three days . The combination of flooding from rainfall and storm surge covered widespread areas of crop fields , mostly affecting soybean and sugar . Other crops in the state had previously been harvested . About 200 cattle drowned in Terrebonne Parish , and thousands were stranded . Crop damage was estimated at over $ 304 million , including $ 100 million to the soybean industry , with overall damage near $ 1 billion across the state . As well as its impact on crops , Juan severely affected the shrimp industry by washing many shrimp offshore and killing others . The storm left about $ 2 @.@ 9 million in damage to oil facilities in the state , including the cost of damaged pipelines . Overall , Juan flooded about 50 @,@ 000 houses in Louisiana , causing $ 250 million in property damage . 
 Near Port Fourchon in Lafourche Parish , the storm surge damaged portions of Louisiana Highways 1 and <unk> and flooded about 1 @,@ 200 homes , some to their roofs . Two levees in the parish were washed out and one was overtopped , inundating 100 houses near Lockport . In Terrebonne Parish , the powerful storm surge swept away parked cars , knocked a home off its foundation , and damaged a 300 ft ( 91 m ) portion of a levee . In the parish , 800 homes were flooded , and 15 @,@ 000 people were left homeless . The storm surge also washed out a 6 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) portion of the levee protecting Grand Isle , and damaged another 14 @,@ 000 ft ( 4 @,@ 300 m ) . The levee , built in 1984 , sustained $ 500 @,@ 000 in damages , which flooded the island with 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) of ocean water . Most of the island lost power , and the city hall and high school , set up as shelters , utilized generators during the storm . In Jefferson Parish , which contains Grand Isle , the storm surge entered 2 @,@ 233 homes and inundated about 3 @,@ 100 cars . In Violet , a man drowned when he fell from his boat into a flooded canal , and another fisherman drowned in Atchafalaya Bay . The surge flooded a 3 mi ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) section of Louisiana Route 23 in Plaquemines Parish , entering several homes , as well as a portion of Route 22 . Between Livingston and Ascension parishes , about 800 homes were flooded , and another 53 homes were flooded in Tangipahoa Parish . Waters from Lake Pontchartrain swept over Airline Highway and portions of a 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) high levee , flooding 250 nearby homes . The storm surge washed out three bridges and flooded 800 homes in St. Tammany Paris , while high waters killed a man in Slidell . One man was electrocuted and killed in <unk> when stepping on a downed wire . 
 While approaching its final landfall as a weak tropical storm , Juan created a storm surge of 6 @.@ 5 ft ( 2 @.@ 0 m ) along the Chandeleur Islands to its west , resulting in extensive beach erosion . The island chain is an important buffer to parts of mainland Louisiana against storms , but is frequently physically manipulated by intense hurricanes . Hurricanes Danny and Elena also impacted the islands in 1985 . Large portions of the Louisiana coastline lost 40 to 100 ft ( 12 to 30 m ) of beach due to the storm , with several new temporary inlets created along barrier islands . 
 = = = Inland and Mid @-@ Atlantic = = = 
 In the states inland from the Gulf Coast , Juan produced lighter rainfall than where its track moved across , but there were totals as high as 6 @.@ 65 in ( 169 mm ) in Arkansas . Rains directly from Juan extended into the southeastern United States , reaching 11 @.@ 17 in ( 284 mm ) on Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina , and through the Mid @-@ Atlantic with totals as high as 2 @.@ 82 in ( 72 mm ) in <unk> , Pennsylvania . Through the Midwestern United States , Juan dropped over 4 in ( 100 mm ) of rainfall in portions of Kentucky , Michigan , and Wisconsin . 
 The rains from Juan and the low it spawned in the Mid @-@ Atlantic moistened grounds across the region . The hurricane 's track helped bring a plume of moisture into the Mid @-@ Atlantic , which set the stage for a major flooding event when a low pressure area stalled on November 5 west of Washington , D.C. Major flooding occurred in Virginia and West Virginia , causing $ 1 @.@ 4 billion in damage and 62 deaths .

 On October 29 , Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards requested that the state 's congressional delegation ask President Ronald Reagan for a disaster declaration . President Reagan responded and issued a disaster declaration on November 1 , which included the parishes of Ascension , Jefferson , Lafourche , Livingston , Plaquemines , Saint Bernard , Saint Charles , Saint John the Baptist , Saint Tammany , Tangipahoa , and Terrebonne , as well as the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans . The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development estimated that highways in the state would require $ 3 million in repairs from damage wrought by the hurricane . 
 Oil companies lost two to three days of production due to being closed by the hurricane . The Louisiana National Guard assisted farmers by dropping hay to stranded cattle over a two @-@ week period . The American Red Cross ran out of funds while responding to the effects of Juan and the mid @-@ Atlantic flooding , following the previous responses to hurricanes Elena and Gloria , as well as flooding in Puerto Rico ; this prompted an emergency fundraising appeal . The agency had provided about $ 8 million worth of assistance to families in southern Louisiana . Along the Apalachicola Bay , the series of hurricane strikes severely damaged the local oyster industry , leaving hundreds of oystermen out of work . The high waves caused by Juan prompted the United States Minerals Management Service to recommend increased inspections on older rigs and improve evacuation plans . Hurricane Juan was one in a series of hurricanes that struck Louisiana coast over many years that contributed to the loss of the coastal wetlands . 
 = LNER Gresley Classes A1 and A3 = 
 The London and North Eastern Railway LNER Gresley Classes A1 and A3 locomotives represented two distinct stages in the history of the British 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 2 " Pacific " steam locomotives designed by Nigel Gresley . They were designed for main line passenger services , initially on the Great Northern Railway ( GNR ) , a constituent company of the London and North Eastern Railway after the amalgamation of 1923 , for which they became a standard design . The change in class designation to A3 reflected the fitting to the same chassis of a higher pressure boiler with a greater superheating surface and a small reduction in cylinder diameter , leading to an increase in locomotive weight . Eventually all of the A1 locomotives were rebuilt , most to A3 specifications , but no . <unk> was completely rebuilt as Class A1 / 1 . 
 The names for the locomotives came from a variety of sources . The first , Great Northern , was named after its parent company . Others were given the names of high @-@ ranking railway officials , but most were given the names of famous racehorses . One was named after the company 's most famous long @-@ distance passenger train , the Flying Scotsman . Flying Scotsman is the sole survivor of the class to be preserved . 
 = = Class A1 : Great Northern genesis = = 
 The new Pacific locomotives were built at the Doncaster " Plant " in 1922 to the design of Nigel Gresley , who had become Chief Mechanical Engineer of the GNR in 1911 . The intention was to produce an engine able to handle , without assistance , mainline express services that were reaching the limits of the capacity of the Ivatt large @-@ boilered Atlantics . 
 Gresley 's initial Pacific project of 1915 was for an elongated version of the Ivatt Atlantic design with four cylinders . Finally realising that he was in a design impasse , he took as a model the new American Pennsylvania Railroad class K4 Pacific of 1914 . This in turn had been updated from a series of prototypes scientifically developed in 1910 under Francis J. Cole , Alco 's Chief Consulting Engineer at Schenectady and the Pennsylvania 's <unk> Alco prototype of 1911 , also designed by Cole . Descriptions of those locomotives appeared in the British technical press at the time and gave Gresley the elements necessary to design a thoroughly up @-@ to @-@ date locomotive . 
 = = Design features and construction history = = 
 The first two GNR Pacifics , 1470 Great Northern and 1471 Sir Frederick Banbury were introduced in 1922 . The Great Northern board ordered a further ten ' 1470 @-@ class ' locomotives , which were under construction at Doncaster at the time of the formation of the LNER in 1923 . 
 In line with the philosophy behind Cole 's Alco prototypes , the Gresley Pacifics were built to the maximum limits of the LNER loading gauge with a large boiler and wide firebox giving a large grate area . The firebox was set low and rested on the trailing carrying axle . However , unlike the Pennsylvania K4 , the firebox was not of the flat @-@ topped Belpaire variety , but a round @-@ topped one that was in line with Great Northern tradition . Features in common with the American types were the downward profile towards the back of the firebox and the boiler tapering towards the front . Heat transfer and the flow of gases were helped by use of a combustion chamber extending forward from the firebox space into the boiler barrel , along with a boiler tube length limited to 19 feet ( 5 @.@ 8 m ) , features inherited from the K4 type but not present on the earlier Cole Prototypes . The boiler pressure was rated at 180 pounds per square inch ( 1 @.@ 24 MPa ) . 
 The 1470 @-@ class Pacific was the third Great Northern locomotive type to incorporate Gresley 's universal 3 @-@ cylinder layout . All three cylinders drove the middle coupled axle . The outside cranks were set at 120 ° , with the inside crank displaced by about 7 degrees to allow for the 1 : 8 inclination of the inside cylinder . Gresley conjugated valve gear derived the motion of the inside valve spindle from the two outside valve spindles : this eliminated an inaccessible middle set of valve gear between the frames . A feature of the K4 that had soon been abandoned by the Pennsylvania Railroad was an unusual three @-@ bar version of the Laird slide @-@ bar . However , Gresley adopted this type of slide @-@ bar for all his locomotives and it was later taken up by Bulleid for his Pacifics and by Riddles for the British Railways standard designs . 
 = = = LNER period = = = 
 The Great Northern Railway was incorporated into the newly formed LNER as a result of the 1923 Grouping . Gresley was appointed Chief Mechanical Engineer of the new company , which was the second largest of the " Big Four " railway companies in Britain . Realising the need for standardisation , Gresley adopted his GNR Pacific design as the standard express passenger locomotive for the LNER main line , designating it ' A1 ' within the LNER locomotive classification system . The choice was made after comparative trials with an equivalent North Eastern Railway Pacific , classified ' A2 ' . Between 1923 and 1925 , 51 A1 locomotives were built ; twenty by the North British Locomotive Company , and the remainder by Doncaster Works . However , Gresley 's Pacifics had been designed to work within the bounds of the Great Northern Railway , meaning maximum distances of less than 200 miles ( 322 km ) . After the grouping , the locomotives were required to have a far greater operating range . 
 = = = Early improvements = = = 
 In 1924 , number 4472 Flying Scotsman , renumbered and named for the occasion , was displayed at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley along with the first member of the Great Western Railway ( GWR ) Castle Class , number 4073 Caerphilly Castle . The latter weighed 19 @.@ 6 long tons ( 19 @.@ 9 t ; 22 @.@ 0 short tons ) less than the Pacific , but was claimed to be the most powerful locomotive in Britain with a tractive effort rated at 31 @,@ 825 lbf ( 141 @.@ 56 kN ) . 
 In the following months , the two railway companies ran comparative exchange trials between the two types from which the Great Western emerged triumphant with <unk> Pendennis Castle . The LNER learned valuable lessons from the trials which resulted in a series of modifications carried out from 1926 on number <unk> Gay Crusader . Changes to the valve gear included increased lap and longer travel , in accordance with Great Western practice ; this allowed fuller exploitation of the expansive properties of steam and reduced back pressure from the exhaust , transforming performance and economy ; the economies in coal and water consumption achieved were such that the 180 psi Pacifics could undertake long @-@ distance non @-@ stop runs that had previously been impossible . There followed a complete redesign of the valve gear , which was applied to <unk> Centenary in 1927 , with the rest of the class being modified in due course . Locomotives with modified valve gear had a slightly raised running plate over the cylinders in order to give room for the longer combination lever necessary for the longer valve travel . Another modification was made in 1927 when number <unk> Enterprise was fitted with a 220 psi ( 1 @.@ 52 MPa ) boiler . This was closely followed by two other locomotives which also incorporated variations in the cylinder diameter and superheater size for comparative purposes . This led Gresley to make a radical departure from Churchward practice by increasing the number of large tubes containing superheating elements , hence increasing the superheater surface area in contact with the hot gases , thus raising steam temperature . The presence of the larger superheater could be recognised from the square covers on either side of the smokebox , a feature that the locomotives retained throughout the rest of their existence . 
 At the 1925 British Empire Exhibition , Flying Scotsman was again exhibited ; but this time , the GWR sent Pendennis Castle . 
 = = Class A3 = = 
 The outcome of the various experiments and modifications made to the A1s in the late 1920s was a new Class A3 " Super Pacific " , the first example of which was number <unk> Felstead . This locomotive appeared in August 1928 with 220 psi ( 1 @.@ 52 MPa ) boiler , 19 @-@ inch ( 483 mm ) cylinders , increased superheat , long @-@ travel valves , improved lubrication and modified weight distribution . Another new development was the changeover from right- to left @-@ hand drive , less convenient for a right @-@ handed fireman , but more so for sighting signals , resulting in the modification of all earlier locomotives . 
 Twenty @-@ seven A3s were built from new , until 1935 , with little variation except for a new type of boiler with a " banjo dome " , an oval steam collector that was placed on top of the rear boiler ring . The first banjo dome was hidden beneath the casing of Cock o ' the North of 1934 ; it was subsequently used in the A4 streamliners . The last nine A3 Pacifics were constructed with the device in 1935 , and it became a standard fitting on all LNER large , wide @-@ firebox boilers that were applied to new locomotives until 1949 . It was also applied to replacement boilers on the A3s . 
 Although all of the original Class A1 locomotives were eventually rebuilt to Class A3 specifications , it was a drawn @-@ out process that lasted until 1949 ; <unk> Sir Visto was the last locomotive to be converted . The changeover to left @-@ hand drive took longer , and continued into the Fifties . 
 = = = Further experiments = = = 
 Despite having settled on a new standard type , Gresley continued to experiment on individual locomotives , in one of which experiments <unk> feedwater heaters were installed in A1 2576 The White Knight and A3 <unk> Shotover . However , on the Pacifics the increase in efficiency was deemed insufficient and the apparatus was eventually removed . In 1935 , number <unk> Lemberg received <unk> piston valves of an ingenious design with automatically varying steam passages . 
 A3s <unk> <unk> and <unk> Humorist were subjected to smoke deflection trials following an accident on the London , Midland and Scottish Railway ( LMS ) due to poor visibility ; this included the modification of the upper smokebox area surrounding the chimney . Originally the whole smokebox wrapper was retained in order to form an air duct , with the exit behind the chimney , but this was found ineffective . The next stage , at least with <unk> , was to cut off the top part of the wrapper , but retaining the sloping plate that directed air flow upwards , and therefore lifting the smoke above the locomotive . The original chimney was replaced by a double stove @-@ pipe variety , and miniature deflector plates were added on either side , angled to concentrate the air flow when the locomotive was on the move . 
 Smoke @-@ lifting devices were not a priority with the normal single @-@ chimney Pacifics . However , with its double chimney and subsequent fitting of a double Kylchap exhaust in 1937 , Humorist continued to pose a problem in this regard and always had small wings on either side of the chimney . Finally , in the 1950s , it acquired the Peppercorn @-@ type of deflector plates . 
 = = = Tenders = = = 
 The original A1s were coupled to a traditional Great Northern type of tender with coal rails of a design that can be traced back to Stirling days . The A1 @-@ variant was a much @-@ enlarged eight @-@ wheel version carrying 8 long tons ( 8 @.@ 13 t ; 8 @.@ 96 short tons ) of coal and 5 @,@ 000 imperial gallons ( 23 @,@ 000 l ; 6 @,@ 000 US gal ) of water . In 1928 , a new special type of tender body was built for the new non @-@ stop Flying Scotsman train . This tender had a corridor connection and an access tunnel through the water tank . It was of a more modern design with high side sheets curved in at the top and had a coal capacity of 9 long tons ( 9 @.@ 14 t ; 10 @.@ 08 short tons ) . In order to be able to pack an extra ton of coal , a single coal rail was provided on this particular series , but was later deemed unnecessary . Ten of these corridor tenders were built , and a non @-@ corridor version of similar design followed with 8 @-@ ton coal capacity and no coal rail . Further series of both types had disc wheels instead of the previous spoked variety .

 = = = Pre @-@ war performance = = = 
 The early A1 Pacifics were a match for the performances demanded of them in the early 1920s . They were certainly able to take loads single @-@ handed that were beyond the capacity of their Atlantic predecessors as was shown in a test run made by 1471 when it took a 20 @-@ coach train weighing 600 long tons ( 610 t ; 670 short tons ) over the 105 miles ( 169 km ) from London to Grantham at an average speed of 51 @.@ 8 miles per hour ( 83 @.@ 4 km / h ) . However this was at the cost of heavy coal consumption , and general performance was well below the ultimate potential of the design . This was largely due to a regression from the earlier 3 @-@ cylinder 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 design , which was the first to have the standard Gresley conjugated motion combined with long valve travel . However , practical problems were experienced with components quickly suffering from premature wear , especially in the main bearing of the large 2 : 1 lever which had not yet been fitted with the very necessary ball race ; excessive ' play ' led to so much over @-@ travel of the middle valve , that it began to hit the end @-@ covers . In order to prevent this , when applying the gear to the Pacifics , Gresley fell back on the expedient of shortening valve travel even though that choked the exhaust at speed , was responsible for the heavy coal consumption , and negated most of the advantages gained by the locomotive 's revolutionary design . However , by incorporating the Great Western @-@ inspired valve modifications , the economies in coal and water consumption achieved were such that the 180 psi Pacifics could undertake long @-@ distance non @-@ stop runs that were previously impossible . 
 The first and most spectacular outcome occurred in 1928 , when the Pacifics were called upon daily to work the Flying Scotsman train non @-@ stop over the 392 miles ( 631 km ) between London and Edinburgh . Initially three A1s and two A3s took turns on this service . The modifications also gave the A1 locomotives greater speed potential , and the proof of this came in 1933 when a high @-@ speed 3 @-@ car diesel railcar service had been mooted . As this would have provided limited accommodation for passengers , it was proposed to use steam traction at similar service speeds with six carriages . A trial return run between London and Leeds was made with modified A1 locomotive number 4472 , Flying Scotsman ; on the return trip with 6 coaches weighing 208 long tons ( 211 @.@ 3 t ; 233 @.@ 0 short tons ) it attained 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) ( 160 km / h ) just outside Little <unk> in Lincolnshire for just over 600 yards ( 549 m ) . There were earlier claims to this speed , notably by the Great Western locomotive <unk> City of Truro , but this 1933 run is generally considered to be the first reliably recorded instance . On a later trial run to Newcastle upon Tyne and back in 1935 , A3 number 2750 Papyrus reached 108 miles per hour ( 174 km / h ) hauling 217 long tons ( 220 t ; 243 short tons ) at the same spot , maintaining a speed above 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) for 12 @.@ 5 consecutive miles ( 20 @.@ 1 km ) , the world record for a non @-@ streamlined locomotive , shared with a French <unk> Pacific . 
 = = = Wartime service = = = 
 Along with all the Gresley 3 @-@ cylinder types , the Pacifics suffered from low wartime maintenance standards , conditions for which they had not been designed . Gresley 's sudden death in 1941 and an unsympathetic successor , Edward Thompson , did not help matters in this respect . In 1945 Thompson took the opportunity to rebuild the first of Gresley 's A1 Pacifics , Great Northern , to the LNER Class A1 / 1 specification with divided drive and separate valve gear for the inside cylinder . Thompson intended to rebuild to this configuration all the Gresley A1s that had not been converted to A3 standard ; in the meantime the remaining Gresley A1s were reclassified as <unk> . The rebuilding of these locomotives as A1 / 1 never happened . Instead , the conversion to A3 standard continued . The A1 / 1 was at first classified as A1 , and reclassified as A1 / 1 when Arthur Peppercorn designed and constructed his own Class A1s in 1947 . 
 = = = Post @-@ war recovery and nationalisation = = = 
 The Gresley 3 @-@ cylinder drive arrangement continued to bring a number of practical problems , the root of which was probably the need for the inside cylinder to be steeply inclined in order to give space for the inside connecting rod to clear the leading coupled axle ; at the same time , the inside valve spindle had to be parallel with the outside ones from which it derived its motion . This problem had been overcome by what Holcroft called a " twist in the ports " ( the passages that carried steam in and out of the cylinders ) . A consequence was that the length of these passages was greater than that generally recommended , increasing " dead space " , and this was combined with a shorter exhaust passage . The net result would be rather different working conditions in the middle cylinder from those on the outside . A contributing problem was that any elongation of the outside valve spindles was multiplied by the conjugated valve gear . Although this had been anticipated at the design stage , the overall consequence was that the inside cylinder had a tendency to give more power than the other two as speed increased , leading to the overloading of the inside connecting rod bearings , especially the big @-@ end which was liable to overheat and fail . Various experiments were tried over the years to cure this chronic ailment , and it was only towards the end of the steam era that a real solution was found in Great Western methods of lubrication and manufacture for the big @-@ end bearing . Other problems persisted , such as a stiff , insensitive regulator and overall design flaws that hampered maintenance . 
 In spite of all this and the introduction of more recent Pacifics , in the middle of the 1950s Gresley types continued to have a quasi @-@ monopoly of East Coast Main Line express passenger services , and as the Sixties approached they went through yet another series of improvements comparable to those of the 1920s . The most significant of these was the fitting of the French double Kylchap exhaust system , which was entirely due to the persistence from 1956 of P. N. Townend , Assistant District Motive Power Superintendent at King 's Cross locomotive shed . These modifications greatly reduced exhaust back pressure , making the locomotives more economical and free @-@ running , and also kept the <unk> clean , reducing turn @-@ around time , so much so that they were able to fit into the more intensive diesel locomotive workings . The Kylchap arrangement was already being universally applied to the A4 streamlined Pacifics , though with the non @-@ streamlined A3 locomotives , the soft exhaust gave rise to smoke drift obscuring the driver 's forward vision . The solution came in the form of narrow German @-@ style smoke deflectors , which somewhat changed the appearance of the A3 locomotives in their latter days . 
 The prototype locomotive , number <unk> Great Northern , had been rebuilt by Edward Thompson into a virtually new design . The first to be withdrawn was <unk> <unk> in 1959 , followed by <unk> Flamingo and <unk> <unk> in 1961 .

 The sole surviving member of the A3s and A1s is 4472 ( 60103 ) Flying Scotsman . The locomotive was withdrawn from service with British Railways in 1963 and was sold for preservation to Alan Pegler .

 In The Railway Series children 's books by the Rev. W. Awdry , the character Gordon the Big Engine is loosely based on an A1 . According to the Rev.

Built in 1922 , Gordon was sold to the Fat Controller in 1923 , once testing was complete .

 Donald Paul Black ( July 20 , 1917 – April 21 , 1959 ) was an American right @-@ handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for six seasons in the American League with the Philadelphia Athletics and Cleveland Indians . In 154 career games , Black pitched 797 innings and posted a win @-@ loss record of 34 – 55 , with 37 complete games , four shutouts , and a 4 @.@ 35 earned run average ( ERA ) . 
 Born in Salix , Iowa , he played minor league baseball in Fairbury , Nebraska , and Petersburg , Virginia , before signing with the Philadelphia Athletics . He played with them for three seasons before being released . Black signed with the Cleveland Indians at the end of 1945 , and after a season with them joined Alcoholics Anonymous . After completing the program , he played two more seasons with Cleveland , pitching a no @-@ hitter on July 10 , 1947 . On September 13 , 1948 , Black suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on the field , which marked the end of his professional career . After a comeback attempt , Black went on to become a sports announcer and salesman . He died in 1959 . 
 = = Early life and minor leagues = = 
 Black was born in Salix , Iowa . He had his first taste of professional baseball in 1937 , when he was signed by the Fairbury Jeffs of the Nebraska State League . The Jeffs were the rookie @-@ level minor league team of the St. Louis Browns farm system . He played alongside two others who would later make the major leagues , George Bradley and Johnny <unk> . Black pitched in 26 games for the Jeffs , posting a 5 @-@ 11 record , 154 innings pitched , and a 4 @.@ 85 ERA . He spent the next three years out of professional baseball , then signed a contract with the Petersburg Rebels of the Virginia League . 
 Black spent the 1941 and 1942 seasons with the Rebels . In 1941 , he pitched in 19 games , starting 16 of them . He won 11 games , lost five , and had an ERA of 2 @.@ 35 . He also threw the first no @-@ hitter of his career that season . The following season , Black pitched in 34 games for the rebels , tying for the team lead with Lou <unk> . He pitched 235 innings , winning 18 games , losing 11 , and finishing with an ERA of 2 @.@ 49 . Black was selected for the 1942 Virginia League all @-@ star game , but did not attend . Instead , he was at the hospital where his wife gave birth to his second child , a daughter . He also threw the second no @-@ hitter of his career , which led to a tryout with the Philadelphia Athletics . 
 = = Philadelphia Athletics = = 
 When he was called up by the Athletics , Black worked to earn a spot on the roster in spring training . After performances which included a 2 – 0 victory over the University of Delaware baseball team where he struck out three in an inning , he was awarded a spot on the Athletics ’ roster for the 1943 Philadelphia Athletics season . That pitching rotation featured many other rookie pitchers including Jesse Flores . Black made his major league debut on April 24 , 1943 and was in the Athletics ’ starting rotation most of the season . He had some early success in his career , pitching a one @-@ hitter on May 30 against the St. Louis Browns in a 3 – 0 victory . Black finished the season with a 6 – 16 record , a 4 @.@ 20 ERA , and 208 innings pitched . He also pitched 110 bases on balls , and hit six batters with pitches ; both numbers were second highest in the American League . Black remained in the starting rotation at the beginning of the 1944 Philadelphia Athletics season , despite possibility of him being drafted into the United States Army for World War II . He was rejected for military service after a physical examination on June 22 , and remained with the team throughout the season . His win total improved from last season ; however , he went a span of about a month , from June 28 until late July , without a victory . He finished the season with a 10 – 12 record , a 4 @.@ 06 ERA , and 27 games started , second highest on the team behind Bobo Newsom . At the end of the season , there were rumors that manager Connie Mack was planning to trade Black and Frankie Hayes to Cleveland for Jim Bagby , Jr. and Jeff Heath , though Mack stated that there was no substance to the rumors . 
 The following season , Black was part of an optimistic Athletics team , so much so that coach Earle Mack felt that Black , Newsom , Flores , and Russ Christopher were the best quartet of starting pitchers in the league . He started the season being considered the ace of the staff , as the others in the rotation were either battling injury or not yet conditioned . His third season in the majors , however , ended with little success . Early on in the season , Black missed some playing time as a result of a badly bruised finger . He was later suspended for a month for violation of team rules . Upon his return , Connie Mack noted that it would be Black 's " last chance " to avoid trouble . He finished the season with a 5 – 11 record and a 5 @.@ 17 ERA . This was Black 's final season on the Athletics . At the conclusion of the season , he was sold to the Cleveland Indians for an undisclosed amount . Connie Mack later stated that he regretfully fired him due to his alcohol use , leading to him not being dependable as a pitcher . 
 = = Cleveland Indians = = 
 Black began the 1946 Cleveland Indians season as a member of the roster , looking to get playing time in an established starting rotation . His season began inauspiciously when he was hit on the chin with a ball , causing him to miss a week during spring training . The 1946 season marked the first time that Black did not finish on the major league roster . After pitching in 18 games for the Indians , he was sent to the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association . While with the Brewers , Black failed to win any games , and at one point was suspended after he disappeared during a road trip . At the conclusion of the season , Indians owner Bill Veeck had a talk with Black , who admitted he had a problem with drunkenness . He agreed to spend the winter with Alcoholics Anonymous with <unk> 's help , and by the time the 1947 Cleveland Indians season began , Black was sober . 
 The year 1947 became a career year for the now @-@ sober Black . There was optimism in the Indians clubhouse regarding his talent , with manager Lou Boudreau saying that Black was " a leading candidate for one of our starting jobs . " In his first pitching appearance of the season against the Detroit Tigers , a tough 5 – 3 victory , someone in the press box said , " I wonder what he ’ d give for a slug of bourbon " , to which he replied , " All I wanted in that situation was a fresh stick of chewing gum . Bourbon doesn ’ t even tempt me . " He followed this with a 1 – 0 shutout win against the Chicago White Sox . A game against his former team , the Philadelphia Athletics , became the highlight of his career . On July 10 , 1947 , Black no @-@ hit the Athletics 3 @-@ 0 at Cleveland Stadium , allowing six walks and five strikeouts in besting Bill <unk> — himself a no @-@ hit pitcher on September 3 of that 1947 season . Only Eddie Joost came close to getting a hit on Black , hitting a ball in the eighth inning that just barely went foul . On top of his no @-@ hit performance , Black had two singles and a squeeze bunt that day . He was modest about his performance afterwards , saying " My control was pretty bad . I got behind on a lot of hitters , but they didn 't seem to hit me . " Black finished the season with ten wins , 12 losses , a 3 @.@ 92 ERA , eight complete games , and three shutouts . At the end of the season , he was planning to play in the Cuban Winter League along with fellow Indians Bob Feller and Al Lopez , though this did not eventuate . During the off @-@ season , Black returned to his hometown of Salix , where he was given a key to the city and made honorary mayor for a day . 
 The 1948 Cleveland Indians season began with Black maintaining a spot in the starting rotation . He had spent the off @-@ season selling tickets for the Indians in Hot Springs , Arkansas . After signing a new contract , Black earned his first victory of 1948 on May 23 in a doubleheader against the New York Yankees , winning 5 – 1 in the second game . Early on in the season , due to the Indians ' pitching depth , Black , along with Al <unk> and Bob <unk> , lost their starting jobs and were moved to the bullpen , though there were plans to still use Black occasionally as a starter . He missed some playing time in June as the result of a bone chip in his left big toe , suffered during batting practice . He pitched for the Indians for most of the rest of the season , making ten starts in 18 total appearances , finishing the season with two wins and losses , a 5 @.@ 37 ERA , and 52 innings pitched . 
 About a month before the end of the season , Black pitched his final professional baseball game . During the height of the 1948 pennant race , on September 13 in Cleveland , Black suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while batting in the second inning during a home game against the St. Louis Browns . He had fouled off a pitch into the upper deck of the stadium , and then collapsed holding onto his neck . He was able to walk to the dugout under his own power , but had lost consciousness by the time an ambulance arrived . Black was taken to St. Vincent Charity Hospital and was conscious for a time , but lapsed into a coma . His doctor noted that he was likely to make a full recovery , though he was " through with baseball for this year and possibly for good . " After a few days in critical condition , he had begun to recover and his condition was reported to have improved greatly . 
 In response to Black 's injury , the Indians hosted a " Don Black Night " on September 23 in a game against the Boston Red Sox to help raise money for his medical bills . In a game watched by 76 @,@ 772 fans , the Indians raised $ 40 @,@ 370 for Black as they won the game , 5 – 2 . The Indians went on to defeat the Red Sox in a one @-@ game playoff for the American League pennant and the Boston Braves in six games in the 1948 World Series as Black recovered in the hospital . After the Indians won the World Series , Lou Boudreau said that the Indians won the title in his honor . 
 = = Later life = = 
 After a stay of six weeks , Black was released from the hospital in late October 1948 . He continued to suffer from headaches , however , and had to have further surgery done in December to remove a weak spot in an artery near his head . He was released from the hospital shortly afterward , but by the start of 1949 his time with the Indians was over , as Bill Veeck stated he would not accept the responsibility of allowing Black to pitch again , though said " If Black is determined to try it again , I won 't stand in his way . " This statement , however , did not keep Black away , as he signed a contract in late January with the Indians for the same amount as the previous season . After pitching with the Indians in Florida for spring training , he returned to Cleveland and decided to retire temporarily , citing that he felt too weak to be effective . He made one final pitching appearance before retiring in an exhibition game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 13 , pitching two innings for the Indians in a 1 – 0 loss . 
 After his retirement from baseball , Black went on to become a sportscaster , automobile salesman , and insurance salesman . He lived with his wife , Joyce , and his two daughters , Stevie and Donna , in Cuyahoga Falls , Ohio . In December 1957 , Black was injured in a car accident in Virginia , leaving him in critical condition . He recovered and spent the following summer teaching for the city recreation department . The following year , on April 21 , 1959 , Black died in Cuyahoga Falls while watching an Indians game at his home . 
 = Saw Mill River = 
 The Saw Mill River is a 23 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 37 @.@ 8 km ) tributary of the Hudson River in Westchester County , New York , United States . It flows from an unnamed pond north of Chappaqua to Getty Square in Yonkers , where it empties into the Hudson as that river 's southernmost tributary . It is the only major stream in southern Westchester County to drain into the Hudson instead of Long Island Sound . It drains an area of 26 @.@ 5 square miles ( 69 km2 ) , most of it heavily developed suburbia . For 16 miles ( 26 km ) , it flows parallel to the Saw Mill River Parkway , a commuter artery , an association that has been said to give the river an " identity crisis . " 
 The watershed was first settled by the Dutch and was the site of Philipse Manor Hall , seat of Philipsburg Manor . The land was owned by Frederick Philipse I and subsequent generations until the family lost it at the end of the American Revolution . The land along the river was later divided into multiple towns . Industry in Yonkers developed along the Saw Mill , so polluting the river by the end of the 19th century that a local poet called it a " snake @-@ like yellow scrawl of scum " . In the 1920s , the last half @-@ mile ( 800 m ) of the stream was routed into tunnels and culverts under downtown Yonkers , a process partially reversed in the early 21st century when it became the first major New York waterway to be daylighted . 
 Today , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) rates the river 's last 2 @.@ 9 miles ( 4 @.@ 7 km ) as an impaired water body . Plastics are commonly found along the riverbank , and metals from industrial factories are found in the water in high concentrations . Nonetheless , the river is home to species such as the American eel , which swim upstream to mature and swim back into the Hudson and the ocean in order to breed . 
 = = Course = = 
 The Saw Mill River rises from a 1 @.@ 75 @-@ acre ( 7 @,@ 100 m2 ) pond in a wooded area of the town of New Castle roughly 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) north of Chappaqua , a half @-@ mile ( 800 m ) west of Quaker Road State Route 120 ( NY 120 ) and just south of Stony Hollow Road , at an elevation of 490 feet ( 150 m ) above sea level . It <unk> and meanders past a cemetery , between hills , through a residential area of houses on large wooded lots in a generally southward direction . Just north of <unk> Drive , its first crossing , it is impounded to create another small pond . In this area it is frequently channelized and impounded as part of the landscaping on the area 's large residential land lots . After crossing under Kipp Street , it bends eastward to cross under Quaker Road . 
 A short channelized portion runs through the front yard of a large house on Quaker southeast of the intersection , after which the river flows back under Quaker and behind the houses on the west side into another impoundment , Chappaqua 's Duck Pond . From its outlet it continues southeast between Quaker on its east and Douglas and Mill River roads on the west to the Saw Mill River Parkway . Just west of the Chappaqua train station , it turns southwest to parallel both the parkway and Metro @-@ North Railroad 's Harlem Line as both cross into the town of Mount Pleasant . At this point the river is at 340 feet ( 100 m ) in elevation , a loss of 150 feet ( 46 m ) from its source . Just south of the town line , it receives Tertia Brook , its first named tributary , from the east . 
 A mile past the town line , the river and its eponymous parkway pass the village of Pleasantville to the east . There the river crosses under the parkway to flow on its west , then crosses and <unk> at the Pleasantville Road ( State Route 117 ) exit . Both make a long turn to the southeast and then back to the southwest around Graham Hills County Park , where it receives Nanny Hagen Brook from the east , before crossing back to the parkway 's west in the flood plain around the base of the hills as road , river and rail pass the unincorporated hamlets of Thornwood , and Hawthorne , where the Harlem Line turns to the south . 
 Just east of the Taconic State Parkway , the river again crosses under the Saw Mill Parkway , then the Taconic . Shortly after that exit it crosses under Saw Mill River Road ( State Routes 9A and 100 ) and some ramps to them from the interchange , then under the Saw Mill Parkway . Both turn south again , then southeast , following the eastern edge of the Pocantico Hills , joined on the west by the North County Trailway bike path , on the right @-@ of @-@ way of the former New York and Putnam Railroad , known as the " Old Put " . 
 The river crosses under the parkway again to form the eastern edge of a plant nursery on Saw Mill River Road , then <unk> as the river , bike path , parkway and Saw Mill River Road all bend around the northwest corner of Eastview , where the Saw Mill drops below 200 feet ( 61 m ) in elevation , a loss of 100 feet ( 30 m ) since Chappaqua . A turn back to the southwest around Tarrytown Lakes County Park puts the river at the outskirts of Elmsford . There it receives Mine Brook from the east . 
 Here the bike path ends amidst the dense urban development , but the parkway continues , and the two again draw close as they enter the town of Greenburgh and intersect the Cross Westchester Expressway ( Interstate 287 ) . A new bike path , the South County Trailway , begins here just south of the West Main Street ( State Route 119 ) bridge north of the Rum Brook confluence . Past that the parkway , trailway and the Saw Mill River all turn southwest , where they intersect the New York State Thruway ( Interstate 87 ) at an oblique angle . For the next mile the Thruway remains close to the river , and Saw Mill River Road , now just carrying NY 9A , returns to the corridor just east of the Thruway as well . 
 The river then runs along the west of V. Everit Macy Park . As part of the park facilities , the Saw Mill River is impounded into Woodlands Lake , the largest impoundment on the Saw Mill River , used as a water supply by the local communities of Ardsley and Dobbs Ferry , whose northern village line is just to the south . The river runs close to the boundary between the two , as the Thruway gradually veers away to the southeast just past the Ashford Avenue bridge . 
 Continuing south @-@ southwest , the river along with the parkway and trailway enter Hastings @-@ on @-@ Hudson , its greenbelt the only major break in the village 's dense suburban development . It slowly veers toward a more southerly heading , and enters the <unk> Park neighborhood of Yonkers after one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) , just south of Farragut Parkway . Once in the neighborhood , the Saw Mill River flows through a Yonkers sewage treatment plant , the other impoundment of the river . After leaving the plant , 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 km ) to the south of where the river entered Yonkers , the parkway and trailway diverge from the river after 16 miles ( 26 km ) , to climb over the watershed divide to Tibbetts Brook . Saw Mill River Road continues to parallel its namesake . 
 Bending to the southwest again , the Saw Mill flows in a narrow channel through an industrial and commercial area . A mile south of the parkway , it flows through the middle of the former Smith Carpet Mills site , where it finally drops to 100 feet ( 30 m ) in elevation . After crossing Ashburton Avenue , the river bends around to flow briefly to the northwest under Nepperhan Avenue after crossing the Old Croton Aqueduct . It circles around War Memorial Field , giving up its remaining elevation as the Hudson River nears . 
 The Saw Mill River turns south again past the park . After passing the towers of a large housing project to its west , it is routed into an underground tunnel at Chicken Island , the triangle between Nepperhan and Palisade avenues and School Street . At Van der Donck Park in downtown Yonkers , it resurfaces as it flows past the post office . For its final hundred feet ( 30 m ) , it re @-@ enters a tunnel under the train station and the tracks of the Hudson Line , after which culverts empty it into the Hudson south of Dock Street . 
 = = Watershed = = 
 The Saw Mill 's 26 @.@ 5 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 69 km2 ) watershed is limited by the hilly topography of central Westchester County to a valley that averages 1 @.@ 4 miles ( 2 @.@ 3 km ) wide ; the only wider spots are the Mine Brook and Tarrytown Lakes subwatersheds and the river 's mouth in downtown Yonkers . The highest elevation in the watershed is 710 feet ( 220 m ) , reached in two locations : the summit of Sarles Hill north of Pleasantville , and an unnamed height of land about 1 @,@ 200 feet ( 370 m ) southwest of Buttermilk Hill , west of Hawthorne . 
 From source to mouth , 10 % of the watershed is in New Castle , 42 % in the town of Mount Pleasant , 33 % in Greenburgh , and 14 % in Yonkers . 63 % of the watershed consists of dense urban or less dense suburban land development , 34 % forest , and 1 % agricultural . The woodlands buffering the river and the South County Trailway is one of the few significant areas of open space in the county south of I @-@ 287 . 
 Some 110 @,@ 000 people live in the Saw Mill River 's watershed , in communities varying from small villages to Yonkers , New York 's fourth @-@ largest city . This is 12 % of the county 's total , on 6 % of its area . The watershed 's population density varies from 1 @,@ 000 per square mile around the headwaters at Chappaqua to 10 @,@ 000 around the mouth . It averages to 4 @,@ 151 per square mile , twice that of the county and ten times the density for the state . 
 On the north , the Saw Mill watershed is bordered by the watersheds of Gedney Brook and the Kisco River , both of which drain into New Croton Reservoir on the Croton River , one of several large reservoirs in that watershed that are part of New York City 's water supply system . On the northeast , the adjacent watersheds drain into Kensico Reservoir , another that supplies the city . Moving south , the next watersheds are tributaries of the Bronx River , then Yonkers ' Grassy Sprain Reservoir and finally Tibbetts Brook . To its west in the narrow strip between the Saw Mill and the Hudson are the Pocantico River and Sheldon Brook watersheds at the north end of the watershed , and those of unnamed shorter streams at the south . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Pre @-@ colonial = = = 
 The Saw Mill River , then known as the Nepperhan River , acted as a boundary between the Manhattan Indians and the Weckquaesgeeks , members of the Algonquian family who fished the region 's streams and lakes with rods and nets . The Manhattans occupied present @-@ day New York City north to the river , while the Weckquaesgeeks occupied the land from the river north to the Pocantico River . The Manhattans ' principal village , <unk> , was on the site of present @-@ day Yonkers where the Saw Mill River discharges into the Hudson River . The Weckquaesgeeks settled the site of today 's Dobbs Ferry , and on the river 's banks west of White Plains . 
 = = = Colonial period = = = 
 In 1639 , the Dutch West India Company acquired from the Manhattans the area that would become Yonkers . Seven years later , Dutch settler Adriaen van der Donck was granted part of this land , including the southern section of the Saw Mill River . His estate was called Colen @-@ Donck , for " Donck 's colony " , and the Nepperhan became known as Colen @-@ Donck 's Kill , after the Dutch word for " stream " . He built a sawmill and a gristmill on his land . After his death , his widow gradually sold the land . 
 In the 1670s , part of Donck 's land passed to Frederick Philipse , who was rewarded with 90 @,@ 000 acres ( 360 km2 ) , including the lower river , for declaring his loyalty to the new British rulers of New Netherlands . Philipse named the manor <unk> and ran it as a quasi @-@ feudal farm , hiring tenants to work the land . Around 1682 , he built Philipse Manor Hall , a mansion along the Saw Mill River that is today a National Historic Landmark . When Philipse died around 1702 , the manor was divided between his son Adolph and grandson Frederick II . In 1750 , his great @-@ grandson Frederick III inherited the whole property and moved from his New York City townhouse to the manor hall , previously used as the family 's summer home . Frederick sat in the Colonial Assembly , where he was a strong supporter of the British government that had given his family everything it owned , but he was primarily interested in managing the land . He improved the manor hall and worked to attract tenant farmers to the land . The family was known for its relaxed approach to its tenants , and the farm was very profitable . 
 Commercially navigable only at its mouth , the Saw Mill River itself was useless as a way to bring crops to market , limiting settlement further upriver . Nevertheless , the roots of present @-@ day communities along the river were established during the colonial era . In 1695 , a land agent named Isaac See settled at the north bound of Philipse Manor , in the flat land between a bend in the river . Other farmers came to the area , and the settlement ultimately became today 's village of Pleasantville . 
 By 1704 , the area that is today Elmsford was known as Storm 's Bridge , after Abraham Storm , who established a tavern at the junction of the Saw Mill River and Tarrytown roads ( today routes 9A and 119 ) that is the center of that village today . In 1719 , one of the Philipse tenant farmers , William Hammond , built his house on land he leased in what is today Eastview , where his house still stands . Along the river to the north , his brother Staats Hammond built two mills along the river ; the small settlement of Hammond 's Mill became today 's Hawthorne . 
 Other settlers came to the Saw Mill River 's headwaters from a different direction . Quakers had been immigrating to Long Island since the previous century to escape religious persecution in England ; in the 1700s , " <unk> " , north of the present hamlet of Chappaqua , was established . In the middle of the century , the community built its meeting house ; it and other buildings of the era are today part of the Old Chappaqua Historic District , listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 . 
 = = = = Revolutionary War = = = = 
 As tensions rose between the colonists and Britain in the early 1770s , Philipse remained loyal to the crown . He was arrested in August 1776 and held in Connecticut until a parole grant at the end of the year allowed him to return home as long as he did nothing to support the British war effort . He broke that promise the next spring : he attempted , perhaps at the behest of his wife , to inform the British that a passing column of Continental Army troops was headed south to attack a British camp at Morrisania , now in the Bronx . Shortly afterwards he fled to British @-@ occupied New York ; he would never return to his home along the Saw Mill . 
 Communities along the Saw Mill played minor parts in the Revolutionary War , especially after the Battle of White Plains in October 1776 . The defeated Continentals retreated to the vicinity of Peekskill while the victorious British withdrew to Kingsbridge in what is now the Bronx . Neither side wanted to cede control of the Hudson Valley , which divided New England from the other colonies . This left most of Westchester unoccupied neutral ground . However , Westchester was not demilitarized . Local militias and raiding parties affiliated with both sides fought each other and terrorized the other 's sympathizers and supporters . Many residents of southern Westchester abandoned their farms and drove their herds up the valley to Buttermilk Hill to protect them from Loyalist raids . The Continentals built forts near Hawthorne , where a minor tributary named <unk> Creek drained into the Saw Mill ( roughly at the junction of today 's Saw Mill and Taconic parkways ) , and built Yankee Dam to create a lake wide enough to slow any British progress up the river . At Chappaqua , the pacifist Quakers opened their meetinghouse as a hospital for injured Continental Army soldiers . Storm 's tavern was a gathering place for Continental officers and , later , their French colleagues . 
 As one of the few routes into hilly central Westchester , the river and its associated roads saw frequent skirmishes . In November 1777 , three young men with Patriot sympathies were walking near the river crossing on the Dobbs Ferry Road ( now Ashford Avenue ) when they came upon a group of horsemen affiliated with Kipp 's Regiment , one of the county 's most @-@ feared Loyalist militias . The young men taunted their rivals , who beat them so severely that two later died . The survivor was awarded a pension , believed to be the first in U.S. history , by the Continental Congress . 
 Later that month , Emmerich 's Chasseurs , an elite unit of Loyalist militia and Hessian mercenaries , staged a midnight raid on Storm 's Bridge . Hoping to capture Storm and his cousins the Van Tassels , all active in the local Patriot militia , the Chasseurs settled for burning and looting Storm 's house and tavern . Proceeding on to the Van Tassel houses , they trapped Cornelius Van Tassel Jr . , one of the cousins ' teenage sons . As the Chasseurs set fire to the houses , he hid on a roof , then jumped off , fended off some putative captors , and fled into the cold waters of the nearby Saw Mill . He got away , but soon died of hypothermia . 
 The Saw Mill River and its adjacent terrain conferred some tactical advantages to those who knew it . One skirmish began when a Patriot militiaman , Jake Acker , was hunting in a bushy area of the eastern flood plain at Elmsford . Spying a large group of British soldiers and Loyalist supporters on the road to Storm 's tavern , Acker began sniping at them from his concealment . He fatally wounded one , changed his position amid the distraction , reloaded his musket , and killed another . Hearing the shots , other local Patriots came to Acker 's aid , and eventually all but one of the larger force were killed or captured . 
 Some senior Continental Army officers spent time in the Saw Mill River valley . George Washington is said to have mentioned the " ford over the Nepperhan at the elm tree " , referring to a wide tree no longer extant ; a century later , residents named their hamlet after the remark . He left a meeting at the Hammond House in Eastview moments before Loyalists converged on it ; his host , Col , James Hammond , the commander of the Westchester militia , was captured and imprisoned for the rest of the war . On the British side , Major John André spent his last night before his capture , with documents exposing Benedict Arnold 's betrayal , at the Rookery inn in Hawthorne . 
 Later in the war , Young 's farmhouse and Four Corners were the site of the largest military engagement near the river . By 1780 , the Continentals were operating much more freely around northern Westchester , although they had to stay on the move to avoid attack . In January , one company of about 250 troops from Massachusetts lingered long enough at Four Corners for local Loyalists to inform the British , who raised a force of about 100 cavalry and 400 to 500 infantry at Fort Washington , today on the northern tip of Manhattan . The force marched to Yonkers and up the Saw Mill overnight , arriving at Four Corners the next morning . The outnumbered Continentals put up stiff resistance , aided by the cold , heavy snow cover and their opponents ' fatigue , but most were ultimately killed or taken prisoner . The British and their Loyalist and Hessian allies celebrated by burning down the Young house ; the Continentals retreated to the north of the Croton River for the rest of the war . 
 In 1779 , the New York State Legislature passed a bill of attainder confiscating the property of British officials and prominent Loyalists , Philipse included . The land , including land in the Saw Mill River watershed , was then distributed to the tenant farmers . In 1788 , the state divided into three the town of Greenburgh , in which the entire eastern half of the tract had been located . The towns of Yonkers and Mount Pleasant joined Greenburgh , all approximately within their present boundaries . In 1790 , a group of settlers organized the Greenburgh Presbyterian Church , and three years later built a church at Storm 's Bridge . ( Today , it is the National Register @-@ listed Elmsford Reformed Church , the oldest building in the village , the oldest church in continuous use in Westchester County . )

 Most of Yonkers ' economy in the early 19th century was derived from the Saw Mill River . As of 1813 , there was a small wharf slightly upstream from the mouth where the sloops that carried river trade put in . Five small mills existed along the river above the village , all with their own dams , small mill ponds , and nearby tenements for the workers . The stagecoach route up the Post Road stopped at an inn near the bridge ; a few stores existed to supply the workers there and at the mills . Some pastures and orchards existed , but the rocky soil deterred most attempts at farming . ( A historian later wrote that it was said at the time that " the succession of boulders was so continuous that one might have stepped from Getty Square to the present Glenwood without setting his foot upon the ground " . ) Between the rocky soil and Wells ' general refusal to sell or lease most of his land , there were so few settlers in Yonkers that two schoolhouses built during the Revolution fell into severe neglect due to the lack of students . 
 The manor house and the surrounding land at the river 's mouth that is today downtown passed through several owners until 1813 , when New York merchant Lemuel Wells bought the 320 acres ( 130 ha ) around the manor house . Wells neither subdivided nor developed the property , although he did extensively landscape the manor house grounds . In 1831 , Wells built a long wharf into the Hudson just above the mouth of the Saw Mill for the steamboat service which had been established between New York and Albany . Otherwise , the property remained largely unchanged until his death in 1842 . 
 Maps of the property from the time of Wells ' purchase and his death show the Saw Mill 's mouth widening into a small estuary before reaching the Hudson . The south bank of the river at the mouth had a 40 @-@ foot @-@ high ( 12 m ) bluff . The only construction directly affecting the river was the bridge that carried the Albany Post Road , today Riverdale and Warburton avenues , part of U.S. Route 9 and Route 9A , over the river . 
 Wells had survived the death of his first wife and all four of his brothers ; he also had no children , leaving him without a clear heir . His estate was further complicated by his lack of a will . Accordingly , under New York law at the time , his holdings were divided among his widow , fifteen nephews and one grand nephew . They decided to subdivide and sell the property , and within a few years more buildings had gone up , just in time for the construction of the Hudson River Railroad in 1848 , which laid its track on a causeway right across the river 's mouth . Over the next several decades , as Yonkers ' population grew rapidly , leading it to incorporate as a village and then , in 1872 , a city , the rest of the estuary was filled in and narrowed and the bluffs on its south side graded out of existence . 
 By the later decades of the 19th century , industry had grown up along the river 's lower portion . So much pollution was dumped into the river from the factories alongside it that a local poet lamented the Saw Mill 's decline in an 1891 quatrain : 
 'Tis now , at Yonkers 's spreading feet , A flow with odorous sins replete ; Its <unk> bosom has <unk> snake @-@ like yellow scrawl of scum . 
 To let the river replenish itself , most of the dams that had been built were removed in 1893 . Ten years later it had somewhat recovered , and people were again using it for drinking water and swimming . 
 In the late 19th century , the New York and Putnam Railroad was built along the Saw Mill River from Putnam County to central Yonkers , and thence to Tibbets Creek and the Harlem River . Various parts of the line operated until the 1940s and the 1980s . The main line of the railroad is now devoted to bicycle and pedestrian paths . They are the South County Trailway on the parts south of Route 119 , and the North County Trailway north of 119 . 
 To <unk> the thirst of its ever @-@ growing population , which had reached almost 100 @,@ 000 by 1915 , Yonkers tapped the Saw Mill . Water from an impoundment two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) north of downtown was held in two reservoirs and two water towers . It was purified by slow filtration through sand and then chlorinated . By 1919 the city was drawing an average of 10 @.@ 6 million gallons ( 40 @,@ 000 m3 ) a day from the river through this system . 
 Despite this , the pollution of the river continued unabated , reversing its earlier recovery . In a 1920 report on the condition of public water supplies around the state , New York 's Health Department said " sanitary conditions upon the Saw Mill watershed are very unsatisfactory " , despite the considerable rules and regulations it had promulgated to protect the river in Yonkers . The city 's own public works department had noted dozens of violations for the previous year , most of them continued from the years before that . " A great many privies and cesspools are located on the edge of the Saw Mill and its tributaries and there is also drainage from poultry yards , <unk> and house drains , " the department noted 
 Rather than enforce the violated regulations more strictly and clean up the river , the city chose to cover it up entirely . Between 1917 and 1922 , the last 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) of river , including a small gorge , was buried in a flume under the Getty Square neighborhood , an effort to halt the river 's frequent floods and quarantine its unsanitary water , and open up some space for further development . That same decade , the county parks commission proposed to build the Saw Mill River Parkway along the river , just as the 1922 Bronx River Parkway follows the Bronx River , and to add a sewer line along the river to prevent contamination of Yonkers ' water supply . Construction began in 1929 and continued throughout the Great Depression . By 1940 , the parkway had reached the river 's headwaters at Chappaqua , where World War II temporarily halted construction . In 1954 , it was complete . The parkway 's construction , along with that of the New York State Thruway later in the decade , required some adjustment of the river 's course in some areas . 
 Westchester 's postwar development led to more stormwater runoff , which often flooded and closed the parkway . By 1958 , engineers were urging that the river be cleaned up to reduce flooding . Still , illegal dumping and overflows continued . For example , storm runoff gave the Yonkers section the river 's highest concentrations of heavy metals , PCBs , and other chemicals , according to a study of the river in 1983 , the year the city stopped using the Saw Mill as its primary water source . A decade later , the sediment in the Saw Mill had the highest concentration of metals in the United States Geological Survey 's entire water @-@ quality assessment program .

 A new kind of pollution entered the lower Saw Mill in 2003 when a Yonkers sugar refinery spilled hydrochloric acid into the river . Westchester District Attorney Jeanine Pirro brought criminal environmental charges against American Sugar Refining , the plant owner , which was forced to pay a $ 20 @,@ 000 fine ; make a $ 100 @,@ 000 donation to Riverkeeper , a regional environmental organization that focuses on the Hudson and its tributaries ; and give one ton ( 800 kg ) of sugar to Westchester Food @-@ <unk> , a local nonprofit that supplies food to other nonprofits . Riverkeeper passed the money it received along to the Saw Mill River Coalition for local projects in Yonkers . 
 In 2008 , Groundwork Hudson Valley , the coordinator of the Saw Mill River Coalition , received a three @-@ year , $ 889 @,@ 183 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Targeted Watershed Grant . One of 15 recipients from a nationwide pool of more than 100 applicants , the group cleans up garbage , removes invasive species , and plants native trees along the river . The group also marks storm drains that drain to the river . On September 25 – 26 , 2009 , the Saw Mill River Coalition organized a BioBlitz to catalog species of plant life , animal life , insects , fungi , and bacteria in the river and its watershed . The Coalition is also looking to restore the wetlands along the river in order to reduce flooding . 
 Raising of the Saw Mill Parkway continues ; in 2013 , a 900 @-@ foot ( 270 m ) stretch in Pleasantville was raised by three inches to reduce flooding from the river .

 The City of Yonkers is currently working on a $ 48 million daylighting project that will remove the flume that the river flows through under Yonkers and bring the river to the surface . The project will uncover the river for six blocks in Downtown Yonkers . The newly surfaced river will be part of an urban park in Getty Square , Downtown Yonkers . 
 The first phase of the project removed a parking lot that covered a two @-@ block section of the river in the Getty Square neighborhood of downtown Yonkers . Ground was broken on December 15 , 2010 , and the work was completed in December 2011 . Work on the second phase , which aims to expose the river in the Mill Street Courtyard , began on March 19 , 2014 . The project has stimulated real estate investment in the area .

 The river affords some of the few remaining open spaces in Westchester County . Near Ardsley and Dobbs Ferry , the river passes through V. E. Macy Park , popular for picnicking and fishing in Woodlands Lake . Butternut Ridge Park contains Tarrytown Lakes and a hiking trail . 
 Two bicycle trails run along parts of the river : the North County Trailway and the South County Trailway , which run from Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx to Putnam County . 
 The Saw Mill was also known as the closest trout fishing river to New York City . In the early 2000s , it was stocked with a few hundred trout each year . The lower river specifically is a good trout river . 
 = = Hydrology = = 
 The USGS maintains a stream gauge on the Saw Mill just above the river 's mouth in Yonkers . Mean discharge since 1944 has been 32 cubic feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m3 ) per second , with extremes of 1 @,@ 840 cubic feet ( 52 m3 ) during the April 2007 nor 'easter and 0 @.@ 11 cubic feet ( 3 @,@ 100 cm3 ) . Average annual precipitation in the watershed is 46 @.@ 2 inches ( 1 @,@ 170 mm ) . 
 The Saw Mill River 's water quality varies , reflecting its history and surroundings . Its headwaters in the town of New Castle are considered " relatively healthy " . There the river is less disturbed , and its ecosystem supports a diversity of organisms . In Yonkers , where it flows through a concrete @-@ lined channel , there is less life in the water and it is considered to be environmentally impaired . A 1983 United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) study found that concentrations of heavy metals in the water increased further downstream , a phenomenon observed with many other pollutants in the river and correlated with the urbanization around and above its mouth . DDT was detected in the streambed sediments throughout the river . In its final 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) , more than 50 micrograms of PCBs were found per kilogram of water . In the 1990s , the USGS found that of the 35 Hudson tributaries it tested , the Saw Mill had the worst levels of cadmium , copper , mercury , nickel and zinc in the sediments near its mouth , and among the worst nationwide ( however , only the river 's manganese levels were found to exceed federal standards ) . It is believed to add more pollution to the Hudson than any other single tributary . 
 Unusually for a river , the Saw Mill 's waters have consistently had a slightly alkaline pH , suggesting it has not been as affected by acid rain as other Hudson tributaries . In 1951 , a state Department of Health survey reported pH between 7 @.@ 25 and 9 @.@ 1 . Four decades later , another study found pH readings rising steadily from 7 @.@ 59 in Chappaqua to 8 @.@ 24 in Yonkers . Similarly , a 2007 Manhattan College study done for the New York State Water Resources Institute found a median low of 7 @.@ 36 in Chappaqua and a median high of 7 @.@ 81 near Torre Road in Yonkers , with a drop to 7 @.@ 67 at the tunnel , for a total median for the river of 7 @.@ 59 . The lowest recorded pH in the year @-@ long study was 7 @.@ 1 at Chappaqua with the highest reading , 8 @.@ 17 , at Torre Road . All results were between 6 @.@ 5 and 8 @.@ 5 , the range required by state regulations . 
 The 1983 USGS study also classified the water quality of the entire river . The first 14 @.@ 5 miles ( 23 @.@ 3 km ) from the river 's source in Chappaqua was classified as suitable for any purpose besides drinking . The next 6 @.@ 0 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) was classified as being safe to drink . The last 3 @.@ 0 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) of the river from the sewage treatment plant to the Hudson was determined to be unsafe to drink , bathe in or fish in . The water was only safe for agricultural and industrial use . 
 In regulations adopted in 1985 and amended in 2008 , New York 's Department of Environmental Conservation ( DEC ) divides the river into four water @-@ quality regions similar to those in the 1983 USGS study . The first 1 @,@ 100 feet ( 340 m ) from the Saw Mill 's mouth is affected by the Hudson 's tides and thus is often salty like the river at that point . It is considered Saline Class B surface water , to be kept suitable for primary and secondary contact recreation such as swimming , boating and fishing , and capable of supporting " fish , shellfish and wildlife propagation and survival . " The next section extends to the <unk> at the Yonkers sewage plant impoundment , and is Class C fresh water , with the same purposes , to the extent that " other factors " do not limit them . From there to the Woodlands Lake inlet is the third section , designated as Class A fresh water , to be kept clean enough for drinking . The remainder to the source is the fourth section , designated Class B , or fresh water kept to the same standards as the salt water above the river 's mouth . Tributaries , named and unnamed , and subtributaries are generally held to the same standards as the section into which they drain . 
 A 1991 study by Irene Gruenfeld , a Williams College undergraduate , measured various pollutants at eight points along the river , from just below the duck pond in Chappaqua to inside the tunnel in Yonkers . The levels increased as the river flowed along , suggesting that most pollutants , especially dissolved salts , came from urban runoff instead of any single point source . The exception was PCBs , which rose drastically south of Elmsford ( a finding that concurred with an earlier study ) and then doubled in Yonkers . The study noted that this suggested a point source , perhaps a known burial site for used capacitors in the Elmsford area , yet Gruenfeld argued that cleaning up this and other possible point sources would not eliminate PCBs in the river . While the PCBs in the river were found somewhat <unk> , chlordane levels are high enough that DEC recommends eating no more than a half @-@ pound ( 230 g ) of fish or eel from the Saw Mill per month . 
 A 2004 @-@ 05 EPA study of the river rated the water quality 6 out of 100 . The study also discovered that dissolved oxygen levels in the water were low because there were few organisms , poor sediment , and little plant life in the river . Although storm water from residential neighborhoods added dissolved oxygen , it also brought ammonia from fertilizer . The Army Corps of Engineers found that the channeling prevented aquatic life from sustaining itself ; few fish naturally spawn in the river because of the cement casing and flume at its mouth . 
 Two years later , a joint study by Manhattan College and the New York State Water Resources Institute found high levels of human fecal bacteria in the water , likely due to municipal wastewater . All 12 sites exceeded the state maximum of a monthly median of 200 organisms per 100 milliliters ( ml ) over five months . Levels were , as with most of the river 's other pollutants , generally the highest near the mouth . However , the uppermost sampling site in the study , at the Chappaqua Metro @-@ North station recorded the greatest single reading of any site , 1 @.@ 2 × 105 organisms per 100 ml , as well as the second @-@ highest ; the researchers speculated that this was due to sewer overflow in the area at the times of those readings . Most of the high coliform readings came after rainfall except at the two sites furthest downstream ; the study theorized that some older buildings in this area of Yonkers may still discharge sewage directly to the river . Since most of the Saw Mill River flows under the shade of a forest canopy , the bacteria may be less likely to be inactivated by sunlight than in other streams . 
 The riverbanks in Yonkers are often lined with tires , shopping carts , plastic bottles , and other trash . In 2008 , DEC found trash and pollution from the river 's mouth to the end of the tunnel . " Urban refuse ( tires , bottles , cans , etc . ) lines much of the lower river , " it reported . " Oil / gasoline slicks are regularly observed along this segment . " 
 The stretches further upriver were slightly better . Between the end of the tunnel and Woodlands Lake , the river was still found to be impaired for recreation , drinking and aquatic life , but less strewn with litter , and as a whole the habitat was merely stressed . Above that point , the Saw Mill 's waters were merely stressed for aquatic life and recreation , with only fish consumption considered to be impaired . DEC did not know the sources of pollutants in this stretch and called for further research . "

 The Saw Mill 's basin is part of the Manhattan Hills in the New England Uplands physiographic region . It is primarily underlain by metamorphic rock such as gneiss , schist and marble . They can be seen in some bedrock outcrops in and around the river . 
 Soils in the river and its basin reflect past glaciation in the area . Glacial till covers much of the river bottom in its headwaters . Further downstream there is stratified drift and alluvium in the sediments .

 The American eel lives in the Saw Mill River and its tributaries . Commonly born in the Atlantic Ocean , the eels maneuver through the river 's tunnel under Yonkers before reaching the more natural parts of the river farther upstream . The eels also scale a 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) dam before reaching Woodlands Lake . Growing up to 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) in length upstream , the eels return to the ocean via the Hudson River to spawn . The planned installation of trash @-@ catching nets along the daylighted portion of the river would prevent the eels from leaving the river to reproduce . 
 More fish have been discovered in the newly daylighted section of the river . Baby blacknose dace and tessellated darter have been spotted in the river in addition to trout . In addition , wood frogs , eastern painted turtles , and redbreast sunfish live in the river too . All of these species have been hurt by the industrialization of the river . 
 About 10 to 20 white @-@ tailed deer per square mile ( 26 to 52 deer per square kilometer ) live along the river and the parkway , more than the ecosystem can carry . They eat low @-@ lying plants , shrubs , and tree saplings , reducing the food supply for smaller animals . The deer also collide with cars — in Hastings , about 1 @.@ 6 times per month . 
 Beavers can also be found along the river , building small dams along the river . Night herons , ducks , and other birds are also present along the river . 
 Numerous invasive plants live along the Saw Mill River . Porcelain berry is a vine with white berries that wraps around native trees and strangles them . Oriental bittersweet is also present along the river , and it is slowly displacing the native American bittersweet . Oriental <unk> can also form hybrids with the native bittersweet and making identification harder . Japanese honeysuckle and Japanese knotweed are two other invasive vines native to Asia . In addition , purple loosestrife , a perennial herb with magenta flower stalks , is also present along the river . 
 Native trees on the river include the pin oak and staghorn sumac . These trees were found along Woodlands Lake , but can be found throughout the entire Hudson Valley . Other native plants include evening primrose , an invasive species in Europe , and wild lettuce . 
 = Ottoman battleship Abdül Kadir = 
 Abdül Kadir was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship laid down in 1892 at the Constantinople imperial dockyard for the Ottoman Navy , the first vessel of this type to be ordered by the Ottoman Empire . The ship was the first capital ship to be laid down by the Ottomans in more than a decade . She was to have a main armament of four 28 @-@ centimetre ( 11 in ) guns , with an armoured belt that was 230 mm ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) thick . Work proceeded on the ship very slowly , primarily the result of a lack of funds ; after two years , only the frames for the hull had been erected , and by the time work stopped in 1906 , the hull had been only partially plated . The unfinished ship was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1909 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Abdül Kadir was to have been the Ottoman Navy 's first pre @-@ dreadnought battleship . She followed a series of ironclad warships built in the 1860s and 1870s . In 1876 , Sultan Murad V was deposed ; the Ottoman Navy had played a role in the coup , which installed Abdul Hamid II on the throne . The new sultan was as a result suspicious of the navy , and attempted to reduce its power by withholding funding and ordering no new capital ships over the course of the following decade . By the late 1880s , however , the ships built by his predecessors were rapidly becoming obsolescent , especially compared to foreign designs like the British Royal Sovereign @-@ class battleships . 
 More importantly , the Greek Navy — a major rival of the Ottoman fleet — had ordered three Hydra class ironclad battleships in 1885 . These ships , though smaller than the older Ottoman ironclads , were kept in a much better state of readiness than the Ottoman vessels , which were left idle in the Sea of Marmara , with little maintenance done . In 1890 , the Ottoman government authorized a large construction program that included two battleships based on the 12 @,@ 500 @-@ metric @-@ ton ( 12 @,@ 300 @-@ long @-@ ton ; 13 @,@ 800 @-@ short @-@ ton ) French Hoche , along with several cruisers and smaller vessels . The two Hoche @-@ class battleships were not built ; instead , a smaller design , to be named Abdül Kadir , was ordered that year . Along with the elderly central battery ironclad Mesudiye , she would have been one of the largest ships in the Ottoman Navy .

 Abdül Kadir was 103 @.@ 63 m ( 340 @.@ 0 ft ) long , and had a beam of 19 @.@ 81 m ( 65 @.@ 0 ft ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 16 m ( 23 @.@ 5 ft ) . As designed , she would have displaced 8 @,@ 100 metric tons ( 8 @,@ 000 long tons ; 8 @,@ 900 short tons ) . She would have been powered by a pair of vertical triple expansion engines each driving a screw propeller , with steam provided by six coal @-@ fired boilers . Both the engines and the boilers would have been manufactured by Tersane @-@ i <unk> . The engines were estimated to have been rated at 12 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 8 @,@ 900 kW ) , which should have provided a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . The ship would have had a capacity of 600 metric tons ( 590 long tons ; 660 short tons ) of coal . 
 Abdül Kadir was to have had an armoured belt that was 230 mm ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) thick , and was to have been 2 m ( 6 ft 7 in ) wide . The upper decks above the main belt would not have had any armor protection . The transverse bulkheads connecting the ends of the belt were to have been 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) thick .

 The German firm Krupp had secured the contract to supply the ship 's armament .

The secondary battery was to have comprised six 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns in casemates . Close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats was to have been provided by a battery of eight 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns and eight 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) QF guns , all in single mounts . Her armament suite was rounded out with six 53 @.@ 3 cm ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes in above water mounts . By 1904 , her planned armament had been revised , with the 28 cm guns replaced with four 20 @.@ 3 cm ( 8 @.@ 0 in ) guns in single turrets , and the number of 15 cm guns increased to ten . The 8 @.@ 8 cm guns were replaced with 7 @.@ 62 cm ( 3 @.@ 00 in ) guns , and the number of 3 @.@ 7 cm guns was increased to ten . Two of the torpedo tubes were removed .

 Abdül Kadir was laid down at the Imperial Arsenal in Constantinople in October 1892 . By 1895 , the steel frames for her hull had been erected , but work proceeded very slowly and frequently stopped , primarily due to the chronically tight Ottoman budget . In 1897 , for instance , work had been halted for some time , and the contemporary journal Navy and Army Illustrated predicted that the ship would not be finished . Similar large @-@ scale building projects during this period also fell apart due to lack of funds ; a major construction program launched in the aftermath of the Ottoman Navy 's poor performance in the Greco @-@ Turkish War of 1897 stalled after funds could not be appropriated for the new ships . By 1906 , when work on Abdül Kadir stopped for the last time , the hull had been only partially plated . By this time , the blocks that supported the hull during construction had shifted , which destroyed the keel . As a result , the unfinished ship was broken up on the slipway in 1909 . 
 = Siege of Fort St. Jean = 
 The Siege of Fort St. Jean ( also called St. John , St. Johns , or St. John 's ) was conducted by American Brigadier General Richard Montgomery on the town and fort of Saint @-@ Jean in the British province of Quebec during the American Revolutionary War . The siege lasted from September 17 to November 3 , 1775 . 
 After several false starts in early September , the Continental Army established a siege around Fort St. Jean . Beset by illness , bad weather , and logistical problems , they established mortar batteries that were able to penetrate into the interior the fort , but the defenders , who were well @-@ supplied with munitions , but not food and other supplies , persisted in their defence , believing the siege would be broken by forces from Montreal under General Guy Carleton . On October 18 , the nearby Fort Chambly fell , and on October 30 , an attempt at relief by Carleton was thwarted . When word of this made its way to St. Jean 's defenders , combined with a new battery opening fire on the fort , the fort 's defenders capitulated , surrendering on November 3 . 
 The fall of Fort St. Jean opened the way for the American army to march on Montreal , which fell without battle on November 13 . General Carleton escaped from Montreal , and made his way to Quebec City to prepare its defences against an anticipated attack . 
 = = Background = = 
 Fort Saint @-@ Jean guarded the entry to the province of Quebec on the Richelieu River at the northern end of Lake Champlain . When Benedict Arnold and Ethan Allen captured Fort Ticonderoga and raided Fort St. Jean in May 1775 , Quebec was garrisoned by about 600 regular troops , some of which were widely distributed throughout Quebec 's large territory .

 The invasion of Quebec began when about 1500 men , then under the command of General Philip Schuyler , arrived at the undefended Île @-@ aux @-@ Noix in the Richelieu River on September 4 , 1775 . On September 6 , the Americans began making forays toward Fort St. Jean , only 10 mi ( 16 km ) away . The army was initially composed of militia forces from New York and Connecticut , with most of its operation directed by Brigadier General Richard Montgomery , who took over complete command from Schuyler on September 16 , when Schuyler became too ill to continue leading the invasion . 
 = = = British defensive preparations = = = 
 Fort St. Jean had been under preparations for an attack from the south ever since Arnold 's raid on Fort St. Jean on May 18 , in which he captured its small garrison and Lake Champlain 's only large military ship . When news of that raid reached Montreal , 140 men under the command of Major Charles Preston were immediately dispatched to hold the fort . Another 50 Canadian militia were raised in Montreal on May 19 , and were also sent to the fort . 
 When Moses Hazen , the messenger bearing news of Arnold 's raid , reached Quebec City and notified British Governor and General Guy Carleton of the raid , Carleton immediately dispatched additional troops from there and Trois @-@ Rivières to St. Jean . Carleton himself went to Montreal on May 26 to oversee arrangements for the defense of the province , which he decided to concentrate on St. Jean , as it was the most likely invasion route . 
 By the time the Americans arrived at Île @-@ aux @-@ Noix , Fort St. Jean was defended by about 750 men under the command of Major Charles Preston . The majority of these were regular troops from the 7th and 26th Regiments of Foot and the Royal Artillery . There were 90 locally @-@ raised militia , and 20 members of Colonel Allen Maclean 's Royal Highland Emigrants , men who were veterans of the French and Indian War . A detachment of Indians ( probably Caughnawaga from a nearby village ) patrolled outside the fort under the direction of Claude de Lorimier and Gilbert Tice . The Richelieu River was patrolled by an armed schooner , the Royal Savage , under the command of Lieutenant William Hunter , with other boats under construction . 
 The fort itself , sited on the west bank of the Richelieu River , consisted of two earthen redoubts about 600 feet ( 180 m ) apart , surrounded by a ditch 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) wide and 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) deep that was lined with chevaux de frise . The southern redoubt was roughly 250 by 200 feet ( 80 by 65 metres ) , and it contained 6 buildings , including a bake house , the fort 's magazine , and storage houses . The northern redoubt was slightly larger , enclosing a two @-@ storey stone house that was used as a barracks . The defenders had cleared brush for several hundred yards around the fort to ensure a clear field of fire . They had put up a wooden palisade to the west of the redoubts , and dug a trench connecting the two redoubts , for ease of communications . The eastern side of the fort faced the river , where there was a shipyard and anchorage for the Royal Savage .

 On September 6 , Generals Schuyler and Montgomery led a force of men in bateaux to a landing point about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) upriver from Fort St. Jean . Schuyler remained with the boats while Montgomery led some men into the swampy lands above the fort . There they were surprised by about 100 Indians led by Tice and Lorimier . In the ensuing skirmish , the Americans suffered 8 dead and 9 wounded , while the Indians suffered 4 dead and 5 wounded , with Tice among the wounded . The American troops , which were relatively untried militia forces , retreated to the boats , where they erected a breastwork for protection . The fort 's defenders , seeing this , fired their cannon at the breastwork , prompting the Americans to retreat about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) upriver , where they set up a second breastwork and camped for the night . The Indians , resentful that neither the British forces in the fort nor the habitants had come to their support in the engagement , returned to their homes . 
 At this camp , Schuyler was visited by a local man , believed by some historians to be Moses Hazen . Hazen , a Massachusetts @-@ born retired officer who lived near the fort , painted a bleak portrait of the American situation . He said that the fort was defended by the entire 26th regiment and 100 Indians , that it was well @-@ stocked and ready for a siege . He also said that the habitants , while friendly to the American cause , were unlikely to help the Americans unless the prospects for victory looked good . Schuyler held a war council on September 7 , in which the command decided to retreat back to Île @-@ aux @-@ Noix . However , on September 8 , reinforcements arrived : another 800 men including Connecticut militia under David Wooster and New Yorkers with artillery , joined them . Heartened by this arrival , they decided instead to proceed with a nighttime attempt on the fort . Schuyler , whose illness was getting more severe ( he was so ill " as not to be able to hold the pen " ) , turned command of the army over to Montgomery . 
 Reports of this first contact between opposing forces outside St. Jean were often wildly exaggerated , with many local reports claiming it as some kind of victory . The Quebec Gazette , for example , reported that 60 Indians had driven off 1 @,@ 500 Americans , killing 30 and wounding 40 . Following this news , General Carleton issued orders for all of the nearby parishes to call up ten percent of their militia . Officers of the militia reported to Montreal , but many militia men stayed home . By September 7 , a troop of about 120 men was raised , which was sent to Fort St. Jean .

 On September 8 , Schuyler sent Ethan Allen ( acting as a volunteer since he had been deposed as head of the Green Mountain Boys by Seth Warner ) and John Brown to circulate a proclamation announcing the Americans ' arrival , and their desire to free the Canadians from the bondage of British rule . Allen and Brown traveled through the parishes between St. Jean and Montreal , where they were well @-@ received , and even provided with local guards . James Livingston , a local grain merchant ( and a relative of Montgomery 's wife ) , began raising a local militia near Chambly , eventually gathering nearly 300 men . 
 Allen also visited the village of the Caughnawaga , from whom he received assurances of their neutrality . The Caughnawaga had been the subject of a propaganda war , with Guy Johnson , the British Indian agent , trying to convince them ( as well as other tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy ) to take up arms against the Americans . However , Schuyler had successfully negotiated an agreement in August with most of the Iroquois to remain neutral . Word of this agreement reached the Caughnawaga on September 10 ; when Carleton and Johnson learned of it , Johnson sent Daniel Claus and Joseph Brant in an attempt to change the minds of the Caughnawaga ; their entreaties were refused .

 On the night of September 10 , Montgomery led 1000 men out again , returning to the first landing site by boat . In the confusion of the darkness and the swamp , some of the troops were separated from the rest . When they encountered one another again , there was panic , as the each mistook the other for the enemy . After just 30 minutes in the swamp , they returned to the landing . Montgomery , who had stayed with the boats , sent the troops out again . This time , the vanguard encountered a few Indians and habitants , and again panicked . Two of the " enemy " were killed , but the troops again made a disorderly retreat to the landing , which their commander , Colonel <unk> <unk> , was apparently unable to stop . 
 While the command staff met to discuss the next move , word came in that the British warship Royal Savage was approaching . This started a disorganized retreat up the river back to Ile @-@ aux @-@ Noix , in which the command staff was nearly left behind . 
 A third attempt was planned for September 13 ; bad weather delayed attempts until September 16 . However , General Schuyler was by this time so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga . He left that day , turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery . Schuyler was not the only one falling ill ; the bad weather , and the swampy , malaria @-@ infested terrain of Île @-@ aux @-@ Noix was also taking a toll on the troops , as more of them became ill as well . The bad news was tempered by good ; an additional 250 troops , in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner , and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel , arrived at Île @-@ aux @-@ Noix .

 On September 17 , Montgomery 's army disembarked from their makeshift fleet just south of St. Jean , and sent out John Brown with a detachment to block the road going north from the fort to Montreal . A small flotilla of armed boats guarded the river against the possibility of Royal Savage attacking the army as it landed . 
 Brown and his men made their first interdiction that day , capturing a wagon @-@ train of supplies destined for the fort . Preston , seeing that this had happened , sent out a sortie to recover the goods . Brown 's men , who had had time to hide the supplies in the woods , retreated until the sounds of the conflict reached the main body of the army . Montgomery , along with Bedel and his company , rushed to Brown 's aid , and succeeded in driving the British back into the fort without recovering the supplies . During this encounter , Moses Hazen was first captured and questioned by Brown , and then arrested again by the British , and brought into the fort . That night , Hazen and Lorimier , the Indian agent , sneaked out of the fort and went to Montreal , to report the situation to Carleton . 
 Montgomery began entrenching his troops around the fort on September 18 , and constructing a mortar battery south of the fort . He ordered Brown to establish a position at La Prairie , one of the sites where there was a crossing of the Saint Lawrence River to Montreal . Ethan Allen went with a small company of Americans to collect Canadiens that Livingston had been recruiting , and take them to monitor Longueuil , the other major crossing point . Livingston had established a base at Point @-@ Olivier , below Fort Chambly , another aging fort at the base of some rapids in the Richelieu River , and was urging his compatriots to join him there . Some Loyalists attempted to dissuade others from joining with Livingston ; Livingston 's supporters sometimes violently opposed attempts by Loyalists to organize , and Carleton did nothing at the time to assist the Loyalists outside the city . 
 Allen , who was already renowned for his bravado in the action at Fort Ticonderoga , decided , when he reached Longueuil on September 24 , to attempt the capture of Montreal . In the Battle of Longue @-@ Pointe , this effort failed on the next day , with Allen and a number of men captured by the British . The alarm raised by Allen 's proximity to Montreal resulted in the mustering of about 1 @,@ 200 men from rural districts outside Montreal . Carleton failed to capitalize on this upwelling of Loyalist support by using them for a relief expedition against the besieging Americans . After several weeks of inaction by Carleton , the rural men drifted away , called by the demands of home and harvest . ( Carleton did take advantage of the moment to order the arrest of Thomas Walker , a Montreal merchant who was openly pro @-@ American and had been reporting to the Americans . ) 
 The conditions for the Americans constructing the siege works were difficult . The ground was swampy , and the trenches quickly became filled knee @-@ deep in water . Montgomery described his army as " half @-@ drowned rats crawling through a swamp " . To make matters even worse , food and ammunition supplies were running out , and the British showed no sign of giving in despite the American bombardment . Disease also worked to reduce the effectiveness of the Americans ; by mid @-@ October , more than 900 men had been sent back to Ticonderoga due to illness . In the early days of the siege , the fort 's defenders took advantage of the land they had cleared around the fort to make life as difficult as possible for the besiegers erecting batteries . Major Preston wrote in his journal on September 23 that " a deserter [ tells us where ] the enemy are erecting their battery and we distress them as much as we can with shells . " Until large guns arrived from Ticonderoga , the fort 's defenders enjoyed a significant advantage in firepower .
