 Despite the controversy , some in France admired " naughty girls who decorate our sun @-@ drenched beaches " . Brigitte Bardot , photographed wearing similar garments on beaches during the Cannes Film Festival ( 1953 ) helped popularize the bikini in Europe in the 1950s and created a market in the US . Photographs of Bardot in a bikini , according to The Guardian , turned Saint @-@ Tropez into the bikini capital of the world . Cannes played a crucial role in the career of Brigitte Bardot , who in turn played a crucial role in promoting the Festival , largely by starting the trend of being photographed in a bikini at her first appearance at the festival , with Bardot identified as the original Cannes bathing beauty . In 1952 , she wore a bikini in Manina , the Girl in the Bikini ( 1952 ) ( released in France as Manina , la fille sans voiles ) , a film which drew considerable attention due to her scanty swimsuit . During the 1953 Cannes Film Festival , she worked with her husband and agent Roger Vadim , and garnered a lot of attention when she was photographed wearing a bikini on every beach in the south of France . 
 Like Esther Williams did a decade earlier , Betty Grable , Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot all used revealing <unk> as career props to enhance their sex appeal , and it became more accepted in parts of Europe when worn by fifties " love goddess " actresses such as Bardot , Anita Ekberg and Sophia Loren . British actress Diana Dors had a mink bikini made for her during the 1955 Venice Film Festival and wore it riding in a gondola down Venice 's Grand Canal past St. Mark 's Square . 
 In Spain , Benidorm played a similar role as Cannes . Shortly after the bikini was banned in Spain , Pedro Zaragoza , the mayor of Benidorm convinced dictator Francisco Franco that his town needed to legalize the bikini to draw tourists . In 1959 , General Franco agreed and the town became a popular tourist destination . Interestingly , in less than four years since Franco 's death in 1979 , Spanish beaches and women had gone topless .

 The swimsuit was declared sinful by the Vatican and was banned in Spain , Portugal and Italy , three countries neighboring France , as well as Belgium and Australia , and it remained prohibited in many US states . As late as in 1959 , Anne Cole , a US swimsuit designer and daughter of Fred Cole , said about a Bardot bikini , " It 's nothing more than a G @-@ string . It 's at the razor 's edge of decency . " In July that year the New York Post searched for bikinis around New York City and found only a couple . Writer Meredith Hall wrote in her memoir that till 1965 one could get a citation for wearing a bikini in Hampton Beach , New Hampshire . 
 In 1951 , the first Miss World contest , originally the Festival Bikini Contest , was organized by Eric Morley as a mid @-@ century advertisement for swimwear at the Festival of Britain . The press welcomed the spectacle and referred to it as Miss World , and Morley registered the name as a trademark . When , the winner Kiki Håkansson from Sweden , was crowned in a bikini , countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates . The bikinis were outlawed and evening gowns introduced instead . Håkansson remains the only Miss World crowned in a bikini , a crowning that was condemned by the Pope . Bikini was banned from beauty pageants around the world after the controversy . Catholic @-@ majority countries like Belgium , Italy , Spain and Australia also banned the swimsuit that same year . 
 The National Legion of Decency pressured Hollywood to keep bikinis from being featured in Hollywood movies . The Hays production code for US movies , introduced in 1930 but not strictly enforced till 1934 , allowed two @-@ piece gowns but prohibited navels on screen . But between the introduction and enforcement of the code two Tarzan movies , Tarzan , the Ape Man ( 1932 ) and Tarzan and His Mate ( 1934 ) , were released in which actress Maureen O 'Sullivan wore skimpy bikini @-@ like leather outfits . Film historian Bruce Goldstein described her clothes in the first film as " It 's a loincloth open up the side . You can see loin . " All at sea was allowed in the USA in 1957 after all bikini @-@ type clothes were removed from the film . The girl in the bikini was allowed in Kansas after all the bikini close ups were removed from the film in 1959 . 
 In reaction to the introduction of the bikini in Paris , American swimwear manufacturers compromised cautiously by producing their own similar design that included a halter and a midriff @-@ bottom variation . Though size makes all the difference in a bikini , early bikinis often covered the navel . When the navel showed in pictures , it was airbrushed out by magazines like Seventeen . Navel @-@ less women ensured the early dominance of European bikini makers over their American counterparts . By the end of the decade a vogue for strapless styles developed , wired or bound for firmness and fit , along with a taste for bare @-@ shouldered two @-@ pieces called Little Sinners . But , it was the <unk> bikini that caused the most moral controversy because of its degree of exposure . So much so as bikini designs called " Huba Huba " and " <unk> " were withdrawn from fashion parades in Sydney as immodest .

 In 1962 , Bond Girl Ursula Andress emerged from the sea wearing a white bikini in Dr. No . The scene has been named one of the most memorable of the series . Channel 4 declared it the top bikini moment in film history , Virgin Media puts it ninth in its top ten , and top in the Bond girls . The Herald ( Glasgow ) put the scene as best ever on the basis of a poll . It also helped shape the career of Ursula Andress , and the look of the quintessential Bond movie . Andress said that she owed her career to that white bikini , remarking , " This bikini made me into a success . As a result of starring in Dr. No as the first Bond girl , I was given the freedom to take my pick of future roles and to become financially independent . " In 2001 , the Dr. No bikini worn by Andress in the film sold at auction for US $ 61 @,@ 500 . That white bikini has been described as a " defining moment in the sixties liberalization of screen eroticism " . Because of the shocking effect from how revealing it was at the time , she got referred to by the joke nickname " Ursula Undress " . According to the British Broadcasting Corporation , " So iconic was the look that it was repeated 40 years later by Halle Berry in the Bond movie Die Another Day . " 
 The appearance of bikinis kept increasing both on screen and off . The sex appeal prompted film and television productions , including Dr. Strangelove . They include the surf movies of the early 1960s . In 1960 , Brian Hyland 's song " Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini " inspired a bikini @-@ buying spree . By 1963 , the movie Beach Party , starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon , followed by Muscle Beach Party ( 1964 ) , Bikini Beach ( 1964 ) , and Beach Blanket Bingo ( 1965 ) that depicted teenage girls wearing bikinis , frolicking in the sand with boys , and having a great time . 
 The beach films led a wave of films that made the bikini pop @-@ culture symbol . In the sexual revolution in 1960s America , bikinis became quickly popular . Hollywood stars like Marilyn Monroe , Jayne Mansfield , Gina Lollobrigida , and Jane Russell helped further the growing popularity of bikinis . Pin @-@ up posters of Monroe , Mansfield , Hayworth , Bardot and Raquel Welch also contributed significantly to its increasing popularity . In 1962 , Playboy featured a bikini on its cover for the first time . Two years later , Sports Illustrated featured Berlin @-@ born fashion model Babette March on the cover wearing a white bikini . The issue was the first Swimsuit Issue . It gave the bikini legitimacy , became an annual publication and an American pop @-@ culture staple , and sells millions of copies each year . In 1965 , a woman told Time it was " almost square " not to wear one . In 1967 the magazine wrote that 65 % of " the young set " were wearing bikinis . 
 When Jayne Mansfield and her husband Miklós Hargitay toured for stage shows , newspapers wrote that Mansfield convinced the rural population that she owned more bikinis than anyone . She showed a fair amount of her 40 @-@ inch ( 1 @,@ 000 mm ) bust , as well as her midriff and legs , in the leopard @-@ spot bikini she wore for her stage shows . Kathryn Wexler of The Miami Herald wrote , " In the beginning as we know it , there was Jayne Mansfield . Here she preens in leopard @-@ print or striped bikinis , sucking in air to showcase her well noted physical assets . " Her leopard @-@ skin bikini remains one of the earlier specimens of the fashion . 
 Raquel Welch wore a deer skin bikini in One Million Years B.C. ( 1966 ) that made her an instant pin @-@ up girl . Welch was featured in the studio 's advertising as " wearing mankind 's first bikini " and the bikini was later described as a " definitive look of the 1960s " . Her role wearing the leather bikini raised Welch to a fashion icon and the photo of her in the bikini became a best @-@ selling pinup poster . One author said , " although she had only three lines in the film , her luscious figure in a fur bikini made her a star and the dream girl of millions of young moviegoers " . In 2011 , Time listed Welch 's B.C. bikini in the " Top Ten Bikinis in Pop Culture " . 
 In the 1983 film Return of the Jedi , Star Wars ' Princess Leia Organa was captured by Jabba the Hutt and forced to wear a metal bikini complete with shackles . The costume was made of brass and was so uncomfortable that actress Carrie Fisher described it as " what supermodels will eventually wear in the seventh ring of hell . " The " slave Leia " look is often imitated by female fans at Star Wars conventions . In 1997 , 51 years after the bikini 's debut , and 77 years after the Miss America Pageant was founded , contestants were allowed wear two @-@ piece swimsuits , not just the swimsuits ( nicknamed " bulletproof vests " ) traditionally issued by the pageant . Two of the 17 swimsuit finalists wore two @-@ piece swimsuits , and Erika Kauffman , representing Hawaii , wore the briefest bikini of all and won the swimsuit competition . In 2010 , the International Federation of <unk> recognized Bikini as a new competitive category .

 Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore appeared in a bikini in An Evening in Paris ( 1967 ) , a film mostly remembered for the first bikini appearance of an Indian actress . She also posed in a bikini for the glossy Filmfare magazine . The costume shocked the conservative Indian audience , but it also set a trend of bikini @-@ clad actresses carried forward by Parveen Babi ( in Yeh <unk> , 1982 ) , Zeenat Aman ( in Heera Panna 1973 ; <unk> , 1980 ) and Dimple Kapadia ( in Bobby , 1973 ) in the early 1970s . Wearing a bikini put her name in the Indian press as one of Bollywood 's ten hottest actresses of all time , and was a transgression of female identity through a reversal of the state of modesty , which functions as a signifier of femininity in Bombay films . By 2005 , it became usual for actors in Indian films to change outfits a dozen times in a single song — starting with a chiffon sari and ending up wearing a bikini . But , when Tagore was the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification in 2005 , she expressed concerns about the rise of the bikini in Indian films .

 In France , Réard 's company folded in 1988 , four years after his death . By that year the bikini made up nearly 20 % of swimsuit sales , more than any other model in the US . As skin cancer awareness grew and a simpler aesthetic defined fashion in the 1990s , sales of the skimpy bikini decreased dramatically . The new swimwear code was epitomized by surf star Malia Jones , who appeared on the June 1997 cover of Shape Magazine wearing a halter top two @-@ piece for rough water . After the 90s , however , the bikini came back again . US market research company NPD Group reported that sales of two @-@ piece swimsuits nationwide jumped 80 % in two years . On one hand the one @-@ piece made a big comeback in the 1980s and early 1990s , on the other bikinis became briefer with the string bikini in the 1970s and 80s . 
 The " <unk> family " ( as dubbed by author William Safire ) , including the " <unk> sisters " ( as dubbed by designer Anne Cole ) has grown to include a large number of subsequent variations , often with a hilarious lexicon — string bikini , monokini or <unk> ( top part missing ) , <unk> ( transparent bikini ) , tankini ( tank top , bikini bottom ) , <unk> ( camisole top and bikini bottom ) , <unk> , thong , slingshot , <unk> , teardrop , and micro . In just one major fashion show in 1985 , there were two @-@ piece suits with cropped tank tops instead of the usual skimpy <unk> , suits that are bikinis in front and one @-@ piece behind , suspender straps , ruffles , and daring , navel @-@ baring cutouts . To meet the fast changing tastes , some of the manufacturers have made a business out of making made @-@ to @-@ order bikinis in around seven minutes . The world 's most expensive bikini , made up of over 150 carats ( 30 g ) of flawless diamonds and worth a massive £ 20 million , was designed in February 2006 by Susan Rosen . 
 Actresses in action films like Charlie 's Angels : Full Throttle ( 2003 ) and Blue Crush ( 2002 ) have made the two @-@ piece " the millennial equivalent of the power suit " , according to Gina Bellafonte of The New York Times , On September 9 , 1997 , Miss Maryland Jamie Fox was the first contestant in 50 years to compete in a two @-@ piece swimsuit to compete in the Preliminary Swimsuit Competition at the Miss America Pageant . PETA used celebrities like Pamela Anderson , Traci Bingham and Alicia Mayer wearing a bikini made of iceberg @-@ lettuce for an advertisement campaign to promote vegetarianism . A protester from Columbia University used a bikini as a message board against a New York City visit by Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . 
 By the end of the century , the bikini went on to become the most popular beachwear around the globe , according to French fashion historian Olivier Saillard due to " the power of women , and not the power of fashion " . As he explains , " The emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women " , though one survey tells 85 % of all bikinis never touch the water . According to Beth <unk> Charleston , research associate at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , " The bikini represents a social leap involving body consciousness , moral concerns , and sexual attitudes . " By the early 2000s , bikinis had become a US $ 811 million business annually , according to the NPD Group , a consumer and retail information company . The bikini has boosted spin @-@ off services like bikini waxing and the sun tanning industries .

 The bikini remained a hot topic for the news media . In May 2011 , Barcelona , Spain made it illegal to wear bikinis in public except in areas near the beaches . Violators face fines of between 120 and 300 euros . In 2012 , two students of St. Theresa 's College in Cebu , the Philippines were barred from attending their graduation ceremony for " ample body exposure " because their bikini pictures were posted on Facebook . The students sued the college and won a temporary stay in a regional court . 
 In May 2013 , Cambridge University banned the <unk> Club of Magdalene College from arranging its annual bikini jelly wrestling . In June 2013 , actress Gwyneth Paltrow , who also is interested in fashion , produced a bikini for her clothing line that is designed to be worn by girls 4 to 8 years old . She was criticized for sexualizing young children by Claude Knight of Kidscape , a British foundation that strives to prevent child abuse . He commented , " We remain very opposed to the <unk> of children and of childhood ... is a great pity that such trends continue and that they carry celebrity endorsement . " 
 Four women were arrested over the 2013 Memorial Day weekend in Myrtle Beach , South Carolina for indecent exposure when they wore thong bikinis that exposed their buttocks . In June 2013 , the British watchdog agency Advertising Standards Authority banned a commercial that showed men in an office fantasizing about their colleague , played by Pamela Anderson , in a bikini for degrading women . 
 = HIP 13044 = 
 HIP 13044 is a red horizontal @-@ branch star about 2 @,@ 300 light years ( 700 pc ) from Earth in the constellation Fornax . The star is part of the <unk> stream , a former dwarf galaxy that merged with the Milky Way between six and nine billion years ago . As a result , HIP 13044 circles the galactic center at a highly irregular orbit with respect to the galactic plane . HIP 13044 is slightly less massive than the Sun , but is approximately seven times its size . The star , which is estimated to be at least nine billion years old , has passed the red @-@ giant phase . The relatively fast rotation of the star may be due to having engulfed one or more planets during the red @-@ giant phase . 
 = = Observational history = = 
 A science team from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy first observed HIP 13044 using Fiber @-@ fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph ( <unk> ) at the European Southern Observatory 's La Silla Observatory in Chile . The first follow @-@ up led to the collection of 36 radial velocity measurements taken between September 2009 and July 2010 . 
 The team also used photometric data that had been passively collected by and publicly released into the archive of the SuperWASP collaboration , which had been observing the region where the star was located . In this data , HIP 13044 was found to oscillate ; the signal was blocked roughly every sixteen days . Analysis of the SuperWASP and <unk> data led to the supposed discovery of the planet HIP 13044 b , although this claim was later refuted .

 HIP 13044 is an F @-@ type star located approximately 701 parsecs ( 2 @,@ 286 light years ) away from Earth in the <unk> stream — a group of low @-@ metallicity stars moving with large velocities relative to the Sun . The star follows an eccentric galactic orbit , with a distance from the galactic center ranging from 7 to 16 kiloparsecs . The orbit does not lie in the galactic plane , and can reach distances as high as 13 kpc above it . This indicates that it once was part of a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way that was disrupted 6 – 9 billion years ago . The star itself is estimated to be at least nine billion years old . 
 HIP 13044 is fairly evolved star fusing helium in its core , and has therefore already passed the red @-@ giant phase of its evolution . It lies near the blue end of the red horizontal branch bordering the instability strip . Its surface temperature is about 6025 K and its radius is approximately 6 @.@ 7 solar radii . HIP 13044 's mass is estimated to be 0 @.@ 8 solar masses . Having a rotation period of 5 – 6 days , HIP 13044 is a fast @-@ rotating star for its type . It is possible that this is because it has swallowed planets during its red @-@ giant phase . 
 HIP 13044 has an apparent magnitude of 9 @.@ 94 and cannot be seen with the unaided eye .

 In 2010 , it was announced that a giant planet in a 16 @.@ 2 @-@ day orbit had been discovered by the radial velocity measurements .

Subsequent analysis of the data revealed problems with the detection : for example an erroneous barycentric correction had been applied ( the same error had also led to claims of planets around HIP <unk> that were subsequently refuted ) . After applying the corrections , there is no evidence for a planet orbiting the star .

 Frederic Middlebrook Richards ( August 19 , 1925 – January 11 , 2009 ) , commonly referred to as Fred Richards , was an American biochemist and biophysicist known for solving the pioneering crystal structure of the ribonuclease S enzyme in 1967 and for defining the concept of solvent @-@ accessible surface . He contributed many key experimental and theoretical results and developed new methods , garnering over 20 @,@ 000 journal citations in several quite distinct research areas . In addition to the protein crystallography and biochemistry of ribonuclease S , these included solvent accessibility and internal packing of proteins , the first side @-@ chain rotamer library , high @-@ pressure crystallography , new types of chemical tags such as biotin / avidin , the nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) chemical shift index , and structural and biophysical characterization of the effects of mutations . 
 Richards spent his entire academic research career at Yale University , where he became Sterling Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry in the department that he created and chaired , " one of the major centers in the world for the study of biophysics and structural biology " . He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences USA and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , and received many other scientific awards . He served as head of the Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research and was elected as president both of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology ( <unk> ) and of the Biophysical Society . 
 = = Personal biography = = 
 Richards was born on August 19 , 1925 in New York City to George H. Richards and Marianna Middlebrook Richards . Both parents were from old New England families who had settled in Fairfield and New London , Connecticut in the 1600s . The family usually spent summers in Connecticut , giving Richards an early affinity for the area which continued through his career at Yale University . He had two older sisters , Marianna and Sarah . Marianna became a biochemist , and was a significant role model for Fred , who delighted in the smells and explosions produced by chemistry sets in that era . He attended high school at Phillips Exeter Academy , and later recalled that " the excellent science department even permitted certain students the unsupervised run of the laboratories outside of class hours . This attitude played a strong role ... in cementing our commitment to scientific careers . " He learned glassblowing and electronics there , and tried to measure the universal gravitational constant using 100 @-@ pound cannonballs . 
 With strong science interests , Richards thwarted his family 's expectations by choosing MIT ( Massachusetts Institute of Technology ) rather than Yale for college in 1943 , majoring in chemistry . His undergraduate time was interrupted by two years in the army , which he described as " uneventful " . He then joined the Biochemistry department at Harvard Medical School and the lab of Barbara Low . She had worked with Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin to solve the x @-@ ray crystal structure of penicillin , and was later active in protein crystallography . The phase problem had not yet been solved to allow determination of protein structure , so his Ph.D. thesis ( completed in 1952 ) studied the density and solvent content in crystals to help determine very accurate molecular weights for proteins . In 1954 he went to the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen to do postdoctoral research with Kaj Linderstrøm @-@ Lang , where he started his classic work on the ribonuclease enzyme . He also absorbed the scientific and mentorship style of Lang , who Richards called " a delightful individual , full of fun and jokes as well as science " exemplifying " simple , inexpensive , ingenious , and insightful experiments " . In 1955 Richards joined the faculty at Yale University , where he stayed for the rest of his career . 
 Richards was an avid and enthusiastic sailor . In addition to sailing on Long Island Sound , he voyaged north along the Canadian coast , south to Bermuda , and even across the Atlantic several times with a small crew of family and friends . He and his wife had sailboats ( Hekla 1 and 2 ) and an outboard @-@ motor utility boat known as " Sally 's <unk> " ( the spelling presumably a comment on her Maine accent ) , which he had built himself . Chris Anfinsen , Richards 's friend and his colleague as editors of Advances in Protein Chemistry and who recommended the Carlsberg Lab to him , was also an avid sailor , and they sometimes joined forces . Wendell Lim wrote that , " a dedicated sailor since childhood , Fred almost always took a month off each summer to captain a major sailing excursion , returning to lab afterwards refreshed and ready to work . His sailing adventures included several transatlantic voyages . He was also an avid ice hockey player . " 
 Richards lived in Guilford , Connecticut , a coastal town about 10 miles east of New Haven , situated between the Metacomet Ridge and Long Island Sound . Fred was married twice , to Heidi Clark Richards , daughter of biochemist Hans Clarke , and in 1959 to Sarah ( Sally ) Wheatland Richards , a marine biologist . He had three children – Sarah , Ruth , and George – and four grandchildren . His daughter Sarah described him as " a lifelong scientist and sailor .... His main loves were his scientific work which he finished at Yale University , sailing , working in his shop , and helping in the community . " Fred and Sally were a major presence in local land conservation efforts , both on committees and in working projects out on the land and water . He donated a 41 @-@ acre shoreline property to the Yale Peabody Museum Natural Areas , which they described as " one of the few natural forest areas left in the state . " The property now has long @-@ term protection for use in biological and geological research .

 = = = Two @-@ component ribonuclease S system = = = 
 On December 2 , 1957 , at Yale University , Richards performed a simple experiment on the protein <unk> A ( RNase A ) that helped change the scientific community 's view of the physical nature of protein molecules . Using a particular protease ( <unk> ) , RNase A was converted into a split protein ( RNase S ) , which is composed of two parts called S @-@ peptide and S @-@ protein ( Richards & <unk> 1959 ) . Richards had developed that cleavage system as a <unk> at the Carlsberg Laboratory in Sweden , using purified ribonuclease protein that had been donated to Christian Anfinsen by the Armour Company and that Anfinsen shared with Richards and other researchers . Richards found that , when separated , S @-@ protein and S @-@ peptide had no RNase activity , but that the RNase enzymatic activity was restored when the parts were recombined in the test tube . In an autobiographical piece , Richards wrote that " this discovery came as a surprise to the scientific community at that time .... In retrospect , this may have been the high point of my career in terms of excitement . " This experiment showed that proteins maintain 3 @-@ dimensional order and tight binding between their interacting parts and that the structural information is inherent in the protein itself , foreshadowing both Anfinsen 's later work showing that sequence determines structure and also the idea that hormones or other small molecules can bind tightly and specifically to proteins , a concept basic to how pharmaceutical companies design drugs today . Two years later , the protein structure of myoglobin confirmed such specific 3D relationships . Later , with Marilyn Doscher and Flo <unk> , Richards demonstrated that ribonuclease S as well as carboxypeptidase were enzymatically active in the crystals , important evidence to silence doubts that the conformations of proteins in crystals are directly relevant to their biological activity in cells . 
 = = = <unk> crystal structure = = = 
 Along with colleague Harold W. Wyckoff , who had worked on early research toward the myoglobin structure , the effort to solve the RNase S 3 @-@ dimensional structure was spearheaded by Richards . Done in 1966 and published in 1967 , the analyses of RNase S and RNase A jointly made ribonuclease the third distinct protein structure to be determined by X @-@ ray diffraction of crystals , after myoglobin / hemoglobin and hen @-@ egg lysozyme , and the first to be done in the United States . Later , the Yale group collected more diffraction data , and in 1970 published the RNase S structure in full detail at 2 @.@ 0 Å resolution ( Wyckoff et al . , 1970 ) . Coordinates for ribonuclease S were deposited into the international Protein Data Bank in 1973 as PDB : <unk> ​ , among the first small set of macromolecular structures . 
 The black @-@ and @-@ white ribbon drawing above shows the large , twisted beta sheet ( arrows ) of ribonuclease , flanked by several alpha @-@ helices ( spirals ) . The shorter S @-@ peptide piece is behind , starting at upper left with a helix and ending with the chain break ( between residues 20 @-@ 21 ) at lower right . The active site for RNA cleavage ( in the groove at center front in this drawing ) involves one histidine side chain from the S @-@ peptide fragment and another from the S @-@ protein part . The computer image shows superimposed structures of ribonuclease S and A , with the S @-@ peptide in gold and the active site <unk> in hot pink . The close match of the 3D structures shows that the 2 @-@ fragment S system does indeed fold to the active form ( Wyckoff et al . , 1970 ) . 
 = = = " Richards ' box " = = = 
 In 1968 , while on sabbatical with David Phillips at Oxford , Richards developed a large optical comparator device called a " Richards ' box " ( or " Fred 's Folly " ) which enabled crystallographers to build physical models of protein structures by viewing the stacked sheets of electron density through a half @-@ silvered mirror ( see photo ) . Once the Folly had been constructed , he built an all @-@ atom brass model of RNase S quite rapidly . This was the method of choice for building protein crystallographic models into electron density until the late 1970s , when it was superseded by molecular computer graphics programs such as Grip @-@ 75 and then Frodo . 
 Richards showed his sense of humor in a later review of developments in the use and construction of Richards boxes . He provided a " correction to the Original Bibliographic Citations , " complete with diagrams , for a theatrical stage technique that used selective illumination and a sheet of plate glass inclined at 45 ° to give an illusion of the nymph Amphitrite rising from the sea and floating in air , or of an audience volunteer dissolving to a skeleton and back again . Richards ended that section by noting that " had this reference been known to the author in 1968 no further description of the ' folly ' would have been required . " 
 = = = Solvent @-@ accessible surface and molecular packing = = = 
 Richards ' most enduring long @-@ term scientific interest was in protein folding and packing , studied both experimentally and theoretically , and mostly from a geometrical perspective . As summarized by George Rose , " protein folders can be divided into ' <unk> ' and ' packers ' . The former seek to minimize the interaction energy among atoms or groups of atoms , whereas the latter concentrate on probable geometry , guided by both excluded volume limitations and structural motifs seen in proteins of known structure . " Fred was a founding influence for the packers , who built on his observations about packing density , areas , and volumes . 
 In 1971 , with <unk> Lee , Richards introduced the concept and a quantitative measure for the solvent @-@ accessible surface ( SAS ) of amino acid residues in folded protein structures ( Lee & Richards 1971 ) . The surface is constructed by tracing the center of an imaginary ball , its radius that of a water molecule ( taken as 1 @.@ 4 Å ) , as it rolls over the van der Waals surfaces of the proteins . Thus defined , the surface is continuous and each point on it is unambiguously associated with a specific protein atom ( the nearest ) . The Lee & Richards definition has been widely adopted as the standard measure for solvent accessibility , for instance to evaluate exposure per residue as a percentage of accessible vs total surface area , and as the basis of the buried @-@ surface @-@ area method for estimating the energetics of protein / protein contacts . 
 Richards 1974 introduced the Voronoi polyhedra construction to protein chemistry , a contribution reviewed more recently by Gerstein and Richards . This approach has been adopted by many others and has been put on a firm mathematical footing by the work of Herbert <unk> . With Jay Ponder in 1987 , as part of an exploration of using internal packing of sidechains to enumerate the possible sequences compatible with a given protein backbone structure ( a foreshadowing of protein engineering and design ) , Richards developed the first side @-@ chain rotamer library . ( Ponder & Richards 1987 ) Increasingly detailed rotamer libraries have been made since then by other research groups , with some used primarily for structure validation and others for homology modeling or protein design . With Craig <unk> , Richards investigated the effects of high pressure ( 1000 atmospheres ) on protein structure , using hen @-@ egg lysozyme crystals , finding that the structure was robust to such pressures apart from a quite modest compaction in size . In the 1990s , Richards and collaborators used a combination of theory and experiment to investigate how the well @-@ packed interior of proteins can nevertheless accommodate mutations . 
 = = = Other research areas = = = 
 In the 1970s , with a succession of students and <unk> , the lab developed a series of chemical , photochemical , and cross @-@ link labels for determining the position and relationships of proteins in biological membranes ( Peters & Richards 1977 ) , including <unk> and what was one of the two first general uses of the exceptionally tight interaction of biotin with avidin , anchored to ferritin for use in electron microscopy . The biotin – avidin system quickly became a central method in cell biology , immunology , and protein engineering , as well as electron microscopy . 
 With David Wishart and Brian Sykes , he developed the chemical shift index for NMR assignment of protein secondary structure ( Wishart , Sykes & Richards 1991 & Wishart , Sykes & Richards 1992 ) . This is still considered a standard tool in the NMR field . Separately , around 1990 , Homme <unk> , with Richards , developed computational tools to design metal @-@ binding sites into proteins , and used them to build a new metal site into thioredoxin .

 The Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry ( " MB & B " ) that Richards founded and chaired at Yale , which amalgamated the medical school Biochemistry and the university Molecular Biophysics departments , was considered to have " quickly gained pre @-@ eminent stature . " Many of those faculty became members of the National Academy of Sciences , and Tom <unk> shared the Nobel Prize in 2009 for crystal structures of the ribosome . Richards was known as a highly valued mentor and friend to students , faculty , and colleagues , including a very supportive approach to women and African – Americans , according to Jim Staros . His colleague George D. Rose wrote that Richards ' lectures were insightful , delivered with clarity and humor , and often deliberately provocative , and that Richards worked to improve the scientific community in general . For instance , in the late 1980s , he was the primary author , and the first of many signers , of a widely circulated letter that successfully urged a policy of depositing 3D atomic coordinates on scientific journals , on the NIH , and on individual crystallographers . He also lobbied , less successfully , for a let @-@ up in overall publication pressure but an increased emphasis on a few first @-@ class papers , by having promotion committees only consider a list of 12 key papers .

 = Fantasy ( 1938 magazine ) = 
 Fantasy was a British pulp science fiction magazine which published three issues in 1938 and 1939 . The editor was T. Stanhope Sprigg ; when the war started , he enlisted in the RAF and the magazine was closed down . The publisher , George Newnes Ltd , paid respectable rates , and as a result Sprigg was able to obtain some good quality material , including stories by John Wyndham , Eric Frank Russell , and John Russell Fearn . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 The first U.S. science fiction ( sf ) magazine , Amazing Stories , was imported into the U.K. from its launch in 1926 , and other magazines from the U.S. market were also available in the U.K. from an early date . However , no British sf magazine was launched until 1934 , when Pearson 's launched Scoops , a weekly in tabloid format aimed at the juvenile market . Soon Haydn Dimmock , Scoops ' editor , began to receive more sophisticated stories , targeted at an adult audience ; he tried to change the magazine 's focus to include more mature fiction but within twenty issues falling sales led Pearson 's to kill the magazine . The failure of Scoops gave British publishers the impression that Britain could not support a science fiction publication . 
 Despite this failure , only a year later , Newnes . , the publisher of The Strand magazine , decided to launch a group of four genre pulp magazines , and to include a science fiction title in the group . The plan was the idea of T. Stanhope Sprigg , a young editor who had <unk> Newnes in 1934 . Sprigg had help from Walter Gillings , a British science fiction reader who had been active in fan circles since the early 1930s , in searching for good submissions , and was able to obtain stories from Eric Frank Russell and John Russell Fearn , but although the other three titles — Air Stories , War Stories , and Western Stories — were launched in 1935 and 1936 , the science fiction title was much delayed . Sprigg recalled later that Newnes issued a memo specifying the requirements for the stories ; it was " so restricting that it threw would @-@ be contributors into a complete tizzy " . The project was placed on hold after fifteen months . 
 Gillings subsequently persuaded The World 's Work , a subsidiary of William Heinemann , to launch a science fiction pulp magazine titled Tales of Wonder in 1937 . This was successful enough to convince Newnes to go ahead with the original plan , and Fantasy was launched in July 1938 , with an issue dated only with the year . Another issue appeared six months later and a third and final issue in June 1939 , again dated only with the year ; Sprigg enlisted as a pilot when World War II started , and although a fourth issue had been prepared , it was clear that paper rationing was coming , and Newnes decided to close down the magazine . 
 = = Contents and reception = = 
 The lead story for the first issue was " Menace of the Metal Men " , by A. <unk> ; this was a 1933 reprint from the British edition of Argosy , but the other stories in the issue were all new . Contributors included John Wyndham , Eric Frank Russell , and John Russell Fearn , and a couple of writers who were not known in the science fiction world but who had contributed to Newnes ' other magazines : J.E. Gurdon and Francis H. <unk> . There was an article on interplanetary travel by P.E. Cleator , which continued a series of articles he had published in Scoops . Newnes paid competitive rates for fiction , so they were able to attract good quality submissions , many of which were subsequently reprinted in the U.S. These included Wyndham 's " Beyond the Screen " ( described by sf historian and critic Sam Moskowitz as " an engrossing story " ) ; Halliday Sutherland 's " Valley of Doom " ; and Eric Frank Russell 's " Vampire from the Void " , which was reprinted in Fantastic in 1972 , having been submitted there by Russell 's agent as if it were a new story . When the editor , Ted White , was told that the story was over thirty years old , he initially denied that it was possible , but ultimately accepted that it was a reprint : science fiction historian Mike Ashley comments that this indicated Russell 's fiction " stood well the test of time " . 
 The main artist for Fantasy was Serge <unk> , a Russian @-@ born artist who worked for Pearson 's and had been responsible for all the covers for Scoops ; <unk> did interior artwork and all three covers . Though his work has been described as " crude " and " mediocre " , science fiction art historian Robert Weinberg regards the cover for the second issue , illustrating " Winged Terror " by G.R. Malloch , as " highly effective and easily the best thing he ever did " .

 Fantasy was printed in pulp format , 128 pages , and priced at 1 / - . All three issues were edited by T. Stanhope Sprigg and published by Newnes . There was no volume numeration ; each issue was dated only with the year . 
 = Common eland = 
 The common eland ( Taurotragus oryx ) , also known as the southern eland or eland antelope , is a savannah and plains antelope found in East and Southern Africa . It is a species of the family Bovidae and genus Taurotragus . It was first described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1766 . An adult male is around 1 @.@ 6 metres ( 5 ' ) tall at the shoulder ( females are 20 centimetres ( 8 " ) shorter ) and can weigh up to 942 kg ( 2077 lbs ) with an average of 500 – 600 kilograms ( 1 @,@ 100 – 1 @,@ 300 lb , 340 – 445 kilograms ( 750 – 980 lb ) for females ) . It is the second largest antelope in the world , being slightly smaller on average than the giant eland . 
 Mainly a herbivore , its diet is primarily grasses and leaves . Common elands form herds of up to 500 animals , but are not territorial . The common eland prefers habitats with a wide variety of flowering plants such as savannah , woodlands , and open and montane grasslands ; it avoids dense forests . It uses loud barks , visual and postural movements and the flehmen response to communicate and warn others of danger . The common eland is used by humans for leather , meat , and rich , nutritious milk , and has been domesticated in many areas . 
 It is native to Botswana , Burundi , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Ethiopia , Kenya , Lesotho , Malawi , Mozambique , Namibia , Rwanda , South Africa , South Sudan , Swaziland , Tanzania , Uganda , Zambia and Zimbabwe but is no longer present in Burundi and Angola . While the common eland 's population is decreasing , it is classified as " Least Concern " by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The scientific name of the common eland is Taurotragus oryx , composed of three words : tauros , tragos and oryx . <unk> is Greek for a bull or bullock , meaning the same as the Latin taurus . Tragos is Greek for a male goat , referring to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland 's ear and its resemblance to a goat 's beard . Oryx is Latin and Greek ( generally <unk> ) for pickaxe , referring to the pointed horns of North African antelopes like the common eland and scimitar @-@ horned oryx . 
 The name ' eland ' is Dutch for " elk " or " moose " . It has a Baltic source similar to the Lithuanian <unk> , which means " deer " . It was borrowed earlier as <unk> ( French ) in the 1610s or <unk> ( German ) . When Dutch settlers came to the Cape Province , they named it after the large , herbivorous moose . In Dutch the animal is called " Eland antelope " to distinguish it from the moose , which is found in the northern boreal forests . 
 = = Physical description = = 
 Common elands are spiral @-@ horned antelopes . They are sexually dimorphic , with females being smaller than the males . Females weigh 300 – 600 kg ( 660 – 1 @,@ 320 lb ) , measure 200 – 280 cm ( 79 – 110 in ) from the snout to the base of the tail and stand 125 – 153 cm ( 49 – 60 in ) at the shoulder . Bulls weigh 400 – 942 kg ( 882 – 2 @,@ 077 lb ) , are 240 – 345 cm ( 94 – 136 in ) from the snout to the base of the tail and stand 150 – 183 cm ( 59 – 72 in ) at the shoulder . The tail is 50 – 90 cm ( 20 – 35 in ) long . Male elands can weigh up to 1 @,@ 000 kg ( 2 @,@ 200 lb ) . 
 Their coat differs geographically , with elands in north Africa having distinctive markings ( torso stripes , markings on legs , dark garters and a spinal crest ) that are absent in the south . Apart from a rough mane , the coat is smooth . Females have a tan coat , while the coats of males are darker , with a bluish @-@ grey tinge . Bulls may also have a series of vertical white stripes on their sides ( mainly in parts of the Karoo in South Africa ) . As males age , their coat becomes more grey . Males also have dense fur on their foreheads and a large dewlap on their throats . 
 Both sexes have horns with a steady spiral ridge ( resembling that of the bushbuck ) . The horns are visible as small buds in newborns and grow rapidly during the first seven months . The horns of males are thicker and shorter than those of females ( males ' horns are 43 – 66 centimetres ( 17 – 26 in ) long and females ' are 51 – 69 centimetres ( 20 – 27 in ) long ) , and have a tighter spiral . Males use their horns during rutting season to wrestle and butt heads with rivals , while females use their horns to protect their young from predators . 
 The common eland is the slowest antelope , with a peak speed of 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) per hour that tires them quickly . However , they can maintain a 22 kilometres ( 14 mi ) per hour trot indefinitely . Elands are capable of jumping up to 2 @.@ 5 metres ( 8 ft 2 in ) from a standing start when startled ( up to 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) for young elands ) . The common eland 's life expectancy is generally between 15 and 20 years ; in captivity some live up to 25 years . 
 Eland herds are accompanied by a loud clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation . It is believed that the weight of the animal causes the two halves of its hooves to splay apart , and the clicking is the result of the hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg . The sound carries some distance from a herd , and may be a form of communication . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The common eland was first described in 1766 by the German zoologist and botanist Peter Simon Pallas . It belongs to the order Artiodactyla , family Bovidae and subfamily Bovinae . Common elands are sometimes considered part of the genus Tragelaphus on the basis of molecular phylogenetics , but are usually categorized as Taurotragus , along with the giant eland ( T. derbianus ) . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 Three subspecies of common eland have been recognized , though their validity has been in dispute . 
 T. o. <unk> ( Sclater , 1864 ; Livingstone 's eland ) : also called <unk> , <unk> , selousi and <unk> . It is found in the Central <unk> <unk> woodlands . Livingstone 's eland has a brown pelt with up to twelve stripes . 
 T. o. oryx ( Pallas , 1766 ; Cape eland ) : also called alces , barbatus , canna and oreas . It is found in south and southwest Africa . The fur is tawny , and adults lose their stripes . 
 T. o. <unk> ( Lydekker , 1906 ; East African eland or Patterson 's eland ) : also called <unk> . It is found in east Africa , hence its common name . Its coat can have up to 12 stripes . 
 = = Diseases and parasites = = 
 Common elands are resistant to trypanosomiasis , a protozoan infection that has the tsetse fly as a vector , but not to the Rhipicephalus @-@ transmitted disease <unk> . The disease @-@ causing bacteria Theileria <unk> has caused many eland deaths . Clostridium <unk> , another bacterium , can be harmful as well . Eland are also hosts to several kinds of ticks . In one study an eland was found to be host to the Amblyomma species A. gemma and A. variegatum , and Rhipicephalus species R. decoloratus , R. appendiculatus , R. evertsi , R. pulchellus and R. <unk> . Elands produce antibodies for Brucella bacteria , but none for Mycobacterium paratuberculosis or various types of pneumonia like contagious bovine pneumonia and contagious <unk> pneumonia , normally infectious in cows or antelopes . 
 = = Genetics and evolution = = 
 Male elands have 31 diploid chromosomes and females have 32 . The male ( Y ) chromosome has been translocated to the short arm of an autosome . Both the X and Y replicate late ; they do not match well and are variable . The chromosomes resemble those of the greater kudu ( Tragelaphus strepsiceros ) . 
 Male elands and female greater kudus can produce a viable male hybrid , though it is not known if it is sterile . An accidental crossing of an east African common eland ( T. o. <unk> ' ) with an east African kudu ( T. s. bea ) occurred in the San Diego Zoo Safari Park . This was believed to be due to the absence of male kudus in the herd . The hybrid produced was sterile , which was unexpected before the study . The study conformed the chromosome numbers of both the eland and the kudu and the strangeness of their attached Y chromosomes . Reports state that repeated matings of male elands with domestic ( Bos primigenius ) and zebu cows ( Bos indicus ) have also produced sterile hybrids . Female elands can also act as surrogates for bongos . 
 The Bovidae family ancestors of the common eland evolved approximately 20 million years ago in Africa ; fossils are found throughout Africa and France but the best record appears in sub @-@ Saharan Africa . The first members of the tribe Tragelaphini appear 6 million years in the past during the late Miocene . An extinct ancestor of the common eland ( Taurotragus <unk> ) appears in the Pleistocene in northern Tanzania and the first T. oryx fossil appears in the Holocene in Algeria . 
 In 2010 , a genetic study was made basing on the evolutionary history of common elands . Located in the sub @-@ Saharan savanna biome of east and southern Africa , the study used methods like analysis of mitochondrial DNA control @-@ region fragments from 122 individuals to learn more about various topics , such as the phylogeography , genetic diversity , demographic history of the species . The conclusions strongly supported the presence of a longer @-@ standing population in the south and a mosaic of Pleistocene refugia in the east . It is believed that today their extinction from these parts could be due to colonization . The similarity of dates obtained from more studies indicates a significant event c . 200 ka , which had brought a great change in the genetic history of the species . 
 = = Ecology and behavior = = 
 Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular . They eat in the morning and evening , rest in shade when hot and remain in sunlight when cold . They are commonly found in herds of up to 500 , with individual members remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months . Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds , while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually . During estrus , mainly in the rainy season , groups tend to form more regularly . In southern Africa common elands will often associate with herds of zebras , roan antelopes and <unk> . 
 Common elands communicate via gestures , vocalizations , scent cues and display behaviors . The flehmen response also occurs , primarily in males in response to contact with female urine or genitals . Females will urinate to indicate fertility during the appropriate phase of their estrous cycle , as well as to indicate their lack of fertility when harassed by males . If eland bulls find any of their predators nearby , they will bark and attempt to attract the attention of others by trotting back and forth until the entire herd is conscious of the danger . Some of their main predators include lions , African wild dogs , cheetahs and spotted hyenas . Juvenile elands are more vulnerable than adults to their predators . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Common elands live on the open plains of southern Africa and along the foothills of the great southern African plateau . The species extends north into Ethiopia and most arid zones of South Sudan , east into western Angola and Namibia , and south to South Africa . However , there is a low density of elands in Africa due to poaching and human settlement . 
 Elands prefer to live in semi @-@ arid areas that contain many shrub @-@ like bushes , and often inhabit grasslands , woodlands , sub @-@ desert , bush , and mountaintops with altitudes of about 15 @,@ 000 ft ( 4600 m ) . Elands do , however , avoid forests , swamps and deserts . The places inhabited by elands generally contain Acacia , Combretum , Commiphora , Diospyros , Grewia , Rhus and Ziziphus trees and shrubs ; some of these also serve as their food . 
 Eland can be found in many National Parks and reserves today , including Nairobi and Tsavo East National Park , Tsavo West National Park , Masai Mara NR , Kenya ; Serengeti , Ruaha and Tarangire National Park , Ngorongoro Crater , Tanzania ; Kagera National Park , Rwanda ; Nyika National Park , Malawi ; Luangwa Valley and Kafue National Park , Zambia ; Hwange National Park , Matobo National Park , Tuli Safari Area and Chimanimani Eland Sanctuary , Zimbabwe ; Kruger National Park , Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park , Giant 's Castle and <unk> NR , South Africa . 
 They live on home ranges that can be 200 – 400 km2 for females and juveniles and 50 km2 for males . 
 = = Diet = = 
 Common elands are herbivores that browse during drier winter months but have also adapted to grazing during the rainy season when grasses are more common . They require a high @-@ protein diet of succulent leaves from flowering plants but will consume lower quality plant material if available including forbs , trees , shrubs , grasses , seeds and tubers . The eland can conserve water by increasing its body temperature . Grasses the eland eats include Setaria and Themeda and fruits from <unk> and Strychnos . Large antelope can survive on lower quality food in times of little rain . Elands feed during the night in hot weather and sleep for long periods during the day . 
 Most of their water is obtained from their food , though they will drink water when available . As they quickly adjust to the surroundings due to seasonal changes and other causes , they also change their feeding habits . They also use their horns to break off branches that are hard to reach . 
 = = Sociability and reproduction = = 
 Females are sexually mature at 15 – 36 months and males at 4 – 5 years . Mating may occur anytime after reaching sexual maturity , but is mostly seen in the rainy season . In Zambia , young are born in July and August , while elsewhere it is the mating season . Mating begins when elands gather to feed on lush green plains with plentiful grass , and some males and females start mating with each other in separate pairs . Males chase the females to find out if they are in estrus . They also test the female 's urine . Usually , a female chooses the most dominant and fit male to mate with . Sometimes she runs away from males trying to mate , causing more attraction . This results in fights between males , in which their hard horns are used . It is 2 – 4 hours before a female allows a male to mount . Males usually keep close contact with females in the mating period . The dominant male can mate with more than one female . Females have a gestation period of 9 months , and give birth to only one calf each time . 
 Males , females and juveniles each form separate social groups . The male groups are the smallest ; the members stay together and search for food or water sources . The female group is much larger and covers greater areas . They travel the grassy plains in wet periods and prefer bushy areas in dry periods . Females have a complex linear hierarchy . The nursery and juvenile group is naturally formed when females give birth to calves . After about 24 hours of the delivery , the mother and calf join this group . The calves start befriending each other and stay back in the nursery group while the mother returns to the female group . The calves leave the nursery group when they are at least two years old and join a male or female group . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Currently , common elands are not endangered . They are conserved by the U.S. Endangered Species Act , and regulated in international trade by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species . Using ground counts and aerial surveys , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) calculates the population density of the common eland to be between 0 @.@ 05 and 1 per square kilometre with a total population estimate of 136 @,@ 000 . Populations are considered stable or increasing in the countries of Namibia , Botswana , Zimbabwe , South Africa , Malawi and possibly Tanzania . 
 The population is , however , gradually decreasing due to habitat loss , caused by expanding human settlements and poaching for its superior meat . As they are docile and inactive most of the time , they can easily be killed . The species became extinct in Swaziland and Zimbabwe , but has been reintroduced . 
 The IUCN states that about half of the estimated total population lives in protected areas and 30 % on private land . Protected areas that support major populations include Omo ( Ethiopia ) , Serengeti , Katavi , Ruaha and Selous @-@ <unk> ( Tanzania ) , Kafue and North Luangwa ( Zambia ) , Nyika ( Malawi ) , Etosha ( Namibia ) , Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park ( Botswana / South Africa ) and <unk> Drakensberg Park ( South Africa ) . Most of these populations appear to be stable . Relatively large numbers of common eland now live on private land , particularly in Namibia , Zimbabwe and South Africa , reflecting its value as a trophy animal . Common elands have also been widely domesticated in Zimbabwe , South Africa and Kenya , as well as in Russia , Ukraine and England . 
 = = Uses = = 
 The common eland is sometimes farmed and hunted for its meat , and in some cases can be better used than cattle because it is more suited to African climates . This has led to some Southern African farmers switching from cattle to eland . Common elands are also pictured as supporters in the coat of arms of Grootfontein , Namibia . 
 = = = Husbandry = = = 
 Common elands have a mild temperament and have been successfully domesticated for meat and milk production in South Africa and Russia . Their need for water is quite low because they produce urine with a high @-@ urea content , but they require a substantial grazing area , along with salt licks and large amounts of supplementary foods like maize , sorghum , melons and beans which can be expensive . A female can produce up to 7 kilograms ( 15 lb ) of milk per day that is richer in <unk> than cow milk . The pleasant @-@ tasting milk has a butterfat content of 11 @-@ 17 % and can be stored for up to eight months if properly prepared , versus several days for cow milk . 
 Housing common elands is difficult due to their ability to jump over fences as high as 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) or simply break through using their substantial mass . Sometimes , wild eland will break through enclosures to mix with domesticated ones . Common elands can reproduce in captivity , but calf survival is low and the young may need to be separated from their mothers to ensure health and adequate feeding . Husbandry requires care because the generally placid animals startle easily and require large amounts of space . 
 = Myst V : End of Ages = 
 Myst V : End of Ages is a 2005 adventure video game , and the fifth and final installment in the Myst series . The game was developed by Cyan Worlds , published by Ubisoft , and released for Macintosh and Windows PC platforms on September 20 , 2005 . As in previous games in the series , End of Ages 's gameplay consists of navigating worlds known as " Ages " via the use of special books and items which act as portals . On each Age , the player solves puzzles and discovers story clues hidden in the Ages or written down in diaries and journals . The player 's actions in the game decide the fate of the ancient D 'ni civilization . 
 In a departure from previous titles in the Myst series , End of Ages replaces pre @-@ rendered environments with worlds rendered in real @-@ time 3D graphics , allowing players to freely navigate the Ages . The faces of actors were digitally mapped onto three @-@ dimensional character models to preserve realism . Cyan paid attention to making the game more accessible to new players by the addition of multiple methods of navigation and an in @-@ game camera . Myst creator Rand Miller decided to give players the ability to decide the fates of the game 's characters as a gift to Myst fans . 
 End of Ages was positively received upon release . Despite complaints such as lessened interactivity compared to previous games and poorer graphics , publications including Macworld , Computer Gaming World , and The Washington Post judged the game a fitting end to the series . After End of Ages 's release , Cyan abruptly announced the end of software development and the layoff of most of its staff , but was able to rehire much of the development team a few weeks later . Including End of Ages 's sales , the Myst franchise had sold more than 12 million copies by November 2007 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Myst V : End of Ages is an adventure game taking place in the first person . Players travel across several worlds known as " Ages " , solving puzzles and gathering story clues by reading books or observing the environment . End of Ages offers players three navigation modes to explore . The first , " Classic mode " , uses the same controls used in Myst and Riven ; Ages are divided into locations of interest , or nodes , and the player 's view is fixed at every node . Players advance to other nodes by clicking on portions of the screen . The " Classic Plus " mode uses the control scheme of Myst III : Exile and Myst IV : Revelation ; movement is still node @-@ based but players can rotate their view 360 degrees in any direction . The final navigation mode , known as " Free Look " or " Advanced " mode , allows players to navigate and observe the Ages freely like Uru : Ages Beyond Myst . The WASD keyboard keys are used for walking forward , backward , and sideways , while the mouse changes the player 's point of view . 
 A new game mechanic to the series is the use of a slate found on all the Ages . These slates can be carved using the mouse to create shapes and symbols . The use of the slate is necessary to communicate with a shadowy race of creatures known as the Bahro . The Bahro understand certain symbols drawn on the slate and will respond to them ; the creatures also retrieve the slate and return it to its original space if the player drops it . Slate symbols can cause environmental changes such as rain or increased wind , which may be necessary for solving puzzles . The slate cannot be carried everywhere due to its size . For example , the player will have to leave the slate behind if he or she wants to climb a ladder . 
 End of Ages has several features designed to help players complete puzzles . To recall clues or important items , players can use a camera feature to take screenshots , which are then placed in a journal the player can access at any time . Player interactions with other characters are similarly recalled via another journal ; everything a character tells the player is stored and can be viewed at any time . Journal pages are narrated by the voice of the character , and missing pages of the journal appear translucent in menus . 
 = = Plot = = 
 End of Ages takes place in the present day , sometime after the events of Uru : Ages Beyond Myst , and begins as the player responds to a letter from Atrus . Atrus is a writer of special volumes called linking books , which serve as portals or links to worlds known as Ages . A linking book to the Age of Myst , the setting of the original game , lies sealed in the ruins of the ancient D 'ni civilization . The D 'ni had the ability to craft linking books , but their society crumbled from within ; Atrus and his family have been trying to restore the D 'ni people and created an Age for the survivors to live on , known as Releeshahn ( introduced in Exile ) . Atrus by this period is an old man , mourning the deaths of his sons Sirrus and Achenar in Revelation , and the death of his wife Catherine in the period after . In his letter , Atrus expresses concern that his daughter , Yeesha , may be lost as well . 
 The player starts in Atrus ' old study on K 'veer , an island near the ruins of the main D 'ni city ; in the antechamber outside the study , there is a strange tablet locked in place on an altar . Yeesha links in and explains that legends state that in order to fully restore D 'ni , someone known as the Grower must utilize the tablet . The artifact has the ability to fully control a mysterious enslaved race known as the Bahro . As Yeesha made the wrong decision upon unlocking the tablet , she can no longer use it ; Yeesha instead charges the player with uncovering the tablet 's power . After leaving Yeesha , the player meets a man named Esher near " the Great Shaft " , connecting D 'ni to the surface ( as detailed in Myst : The Book of Ti 'ana ) . Esher is a survivor of the fall of D 'ni and tells the player that Yeesha cannot be trusted , warning the player not to give her the Tablet . Throughout the Great Shaft , the player collects twelve fragments of Yeesha 's journal . The writings appear to confirm Esher 's warnings , as the narration seemingly indicates that Yeesha has descended into madness , believing herself to be the Grower . 
 At the urging of both Yeesha and Esher , the player travels across four Ages , collecting four slates that unlock the tablet 's power . Esher occasionally appears in the Ages to offer his counsel , or reveal the histories of his people and the worlds the player explores . Once all four slates are collected , Esher requests that the player bring the tablet to him in the now @-@ unlocked Age of Myst . The player is then returned to K 'veer , where they have four possible choices . Travelling to Myst without the tablet will cause Esher to angrily abandon the player with no way out . If Esher is given the tablet , he will explain he wishes to use the tablet for domination , and will also leave the player trapped . If the player gives the tablet to Yeesha , the tablet simply slips through her hands and disappears into the ground ; she walks away , disappointed , leaving the player trapped in D 'ni . The only good ending involves giving the Bahro the tablet , ending their enslavement . Arriving at Releeshahn , the new home Age of the D 'ni , Yeesha and Atrus thank the player and speak of a new chapter for the D 'ni people ; Esher is handed over to the Bahro to be punished for his crimes . The game ends on a visit to Releeshahn .

 Robyn and Rand Miller , Myst 's creators , had initially decided against creating sequels to 1997 's Riven . However , the publishing rights to the series later transferred to Ubisoft , who commissioned two sequels : Myst III : Exile and Myst IV : Revelation . Myst V : End of Ages was officially announced at the 2005 MacWorld Expo by Myst and Riven 's developer , Cyan Worlds . In the announcement , Cyan stated that the game would be the final installment in the series . 
 Whereas most previous Myst titles had forgone 3D graphics rendered in real @-@ time in favor of interactive prerendered environments , Rand Miller decided that technology had advanced to the point that End of Ages could use real @-@ time graphics without sacrificing player immersion . " Over the years the Myst games have become increasingly sophisticated , culminating in Myst V , where we offer striking graphics that players can walk smoothly through , " Miller stated in an interview . Miller emphasized that the goal of the game remained for players to become immersed in Myst 's alternate worlds . 
 A focus in development was to make End of Ages more accessible than previous Myst games , which had often stymied uninitiated players with their puzzles . Learning from the control scheme used in another real @-@ time Myst game ( a remake of the original entitled realMyst ) , Cyan decided to develop multiple control methods to allow new players to quickly learn the controls , as well as provide a familiar interface for franchise veterans . Esher 's experiences with the player 's quest allowed a hint system to be built into the story . Miller wanted to make a significant change from previous games in the series , in that the player 's actions decide the fate of the characters . When asked about the ending , Miller explained , " The future of civilization is down to this point , and the choices you make determine where it goes . " 
 Myst games had typically used chroma key to insert footage of actors into digital backgrounds . The models of End of Ages 's characters were instead computer @-@ generated , but Cyan did not want to lose the warmth and feeling provided by using a live actor . Instead Cyan created a contraption mounted to the actor 's faces that captured video of the actor 's faces while they spoke their lines . The video was then manipulated and used as a facial texture which was mapped onto the 3D characters , and the facial movement was also tracked and used to animate the faces of the characters in @-@ game . Motion capture of the body was also used to ensure lifelike movement . Cyan staff were worried that the audio synching for animation would not be finished in time for the E3 unveiling of the game , but were happy with the end results . Critical reaction to game previews and impressions at E3 was highly positive . Miller was relieved , stating that when the mostly shooter game @-@ dominated showcase declared that End of Ages might be the best game in the series , " That feels good " . 
 = = = Audio = = = 
 Composer Tim Larkin , a sound designer and audio director at Cyan who had previously worked on realMyst and Uru : Ages Beyond Myst , was given the task of developing Myst V 's musical score . Larkin stated that whereas earlier Myst games had been constrained by technological limitations , the available technology allowed End of Ages to have a more dynamic environment , with the music changing with various timings of different sound effects . Surround sound provided a more realistic and immersive gameplay experience . A major challenge in writing the music was that the score had to be flexible enough to match the non @-@ linear gameplay events . " Games are totally interactive experiences , " Larkin explained . " You don 't guide a player through , since you can 't count on being at a certain place at a certain time . I can 't write cue music to get the player to do this , this and then this . One player might hear the cue and run the other way ! " Larkin had to step away from what he had learned as a jazz composer and musician writing pieces with a definite beginning and end , instead creating music with " less arc " and structure . Larkin admitted that some Myst fans would have preferred a musical style similar to Robyn Miller 's scores for Myst and Riven , but replied by saying that change happens and players would find something to like in the new music if they kept an open mind . 
 Due to a tight budget , Larkin was unable to hire an orchestra to perform the music ; all the instruments in the soundtrack aside from Larkin 's own trumpet playing are sampled instruments . Larkin used a variety of synthesizers , samplers , and computers to create the score , working at his home studio and Cyan 's offices . Larkin found that the biggest challenge with the score was finishing it on time for the game to ship . The soundtrack was released in CD format on October 25 , 2005 . 
 = = = Release = = = 
 End of Ages was packaged in two different retail versions for release in September 2005 , to coincide with the 12th anniversary of the franchise 's debut . A standard edition , containing only the game , was released for Windows @-@ based PCs in a CD @-@ ROM format . The limited edition contained the original soundtrack , a collector 's lithograph , strategy guide , and a bonus DVD with a " making of " retrospective on the Myst franchise . The video was made by GameTap , a subsidiary of Turner Broadcasting System ; the behind @-@ the @-@ scenes feature was the first game @-@ related documentary developed by Turner . The limited edition was shipped on hybrid Mac OS X / Windows DVDs , with Macintosh conversion provided by Quebec @-@ based developer Beenox ; this was the only commercial option for Macintosh players . 
 Shortly before End of Ages was released , Cyan announced the layoff of most of the staff and that the company would be ceasing software development . The reason for the sudden closure was a failure to gain financial backing for a new project after End of Ages 's development . Part of the blame for the company 's financial troubles were placed on the commercial disappointment of Uru : Ages Beyond Myst . The company was , according to Rand Miller , " able to pull a rabbit out of a hat " and rehire " almost all " the employees a few weeks later after backing for a new project was secured . With the release of End of Ages , Cyan stated that their next game would have nothing to do with the Myst series . While pitching an unnamed online game to publishers , Cyan produced Cosmic Osmo 's : Hex Isle with online content site <unk> . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Overall , End of Ages was well received by critics . The game was judged a fitting end to the series , and in combination with the other games in the series sold more than 12 million copies by November 2007 . 
 As with previous games , the visuals of End of Ages were widely praised . The switch to real @-@ time rendering was generally seen as a positive step . The game 's music was lauded ; GameSpot 's review noted the use of music in End of Ages was sparse , but the little audio present set the proper tone for different Ages . A few reviewers , such as Charles Herold of the New York Times , felt that the graphics fell short of what was possible , especially compared to the prerendered visuals of Myst IV : Revelation . While Greg Kasavin of GameSpot felt that though the visuals were on par with previous games , End of Ages was missing several elements which made Myst IV more immersive ; only important , story @-@ driving items could be interacted with , for example , and the player makes no sounds or footsteps in the game . 
 The characters of Myst , occasionally ridiculed in previous games , were well received in End of Ages . Publications such as GameSpot and IGN praised the voice acting and the switch to character models ; <unk> Castro of IGN stated that though the player could not interact directly with the characters , the rendered characters wound up " feeling more genuine and real " than in previous games , speaking with genuine conviction and animation . Special praise was given to David Ogden Stiers for bringing Esher to life . A dissenting opinion was presented by reviewer Mark Saltzman , who thought that players might become bored by the " overly dramatic " character dialogue . 
 Critics warmly received the addition of the slate and its related puzzles . Oliver Clare of Eurogamer called the slate system a welcome addition to the Myst formula , although he felt that the recognition of symbols was occasionally too precise . Paul Presley of Computer and Video Games felt that the slate concept could have been explored further , while GameSpot enjoyed the environmental effects created by the slates . End of Ages won several awards upon release , including IGN 's " editor 's choice " . Larkin 's music was nominated under the " Best Interactive Score " category at the 2006 Game Audio Network Guild Awards , and won the 2006 Game Industry News award for best soundtrack .

 Mark Trammell of TV Equals was very pleased with the episode and wrote that " Rainn Wilson [ was ] clearly in his element " . Damon Houx of <unk> felt that the entry was rushed , which resulted in " most characters [ getting ] 2 @-@ 3 minute storylines , or — in most cases — a joke or line or two . " He called it " one of the better episodes of this last season " , but noted that " the show 's going to end with more of a whimper than a bang " . Cindy White of IGN awarded the episode a 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 , denoting a " good " episode . White complimented Dwight and Pam 's situation , as well Angela and Oscar 's development . However , she noted that it " wasn 't hard to imagine Michael in [ Dwight 's ] situation " . Furthermore , she compared the episode to the third season episode " Women 's Appreciation " . 
 Erik Adams of The A.V.

Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five . While enjoying the story 's main plots — specifically citing Angela and Oscar 's " sneak around " , and Dwight 's endeavor — he was critical of Jim 's subplot , writing that " I couldn 't care less about the issues he was facing with teleconferencing . " 
 Melora Hardin 's return garnered critical attention . Forcella wrote that " Jan was definitely a welcome appearance " . Furthermore , he praised her " all @-@ around meanness " and the " hilarity of her singing " . Houx wrote that " the return of Jan Levinson and the final solution to get her business was pretty good . " Adams , on the other hand , was critical of the return of Hardin , noting that " there ’ s little reason to justify Melora Hardin ’ s presence in ' The Whale ' " other than " an obligation [ for ] The Office ’ s final @-@ season victory lap . " White noted that it " was nice to see Melora Hardin in the role one last time " , but wrote that " it 's a shame that the show is sticking with the crazy version of the character rather than mellowing her out a bit " .

 On the first pitch thrown by Harvey , Alcides Escobar hit an inside @-@ the @-@ park home run , the first in a World Series game since Mule Haas in the 1929 World Series , and the first hit by a leadoff batter since Patsy Dougherty did it for the Boston Americans in the 1903 World Series .

The Royals made a few uncharacteristic mistakes in this game , the first coming in the fourth inning when pitcher Yordano Ventura forgot to cover the base on a ground ball to the first baseman , and the second in the sixth inning when Royals pitcher Franklin Morales triple @-@ clutched Granderson 's ground ball , allowing all runners to be safe , which led to a 2 @-@ run single by Wright . 
 In the fifth inning , Royals player Raúl A. Mondesí made his Major League Baseball debut , pinch hitting for Danny Duffy . Mondesí became the first player ever to make his MLB debut in the World Series . 
 = = = Game 4 = = = 
 The ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by country singer Tim McGraw , son of the late Mets relief pitcher Tug McGraw . The starting pitchers for Game 4 were Chris Young of the Royals and Steven Matz of the Mets . Conforto scored the game 's first run with a home run in the third inning , and Flores scored later in the inning on a Granderson sacrifice fly , where right @-@ fielder Ríos didn 't make an immediate throw home thinking that was the third out , even though it was just the second out of the inning . The Royals cut the deficit to 2 – 1 in the top of the fifth when Pérez doubled and was then driven in by Gordon . However , in the bottom of the fifth , Conforto hit another home run , becoming the first rookie to hit two home runs in a World Series game since Andruw Jones in the 1996 World Series . In the sixth inning , Zobrist hit his eighth double of the postseason , tying a postseason record previously set by Albert Pujols and David Freese of the 2011 St. Louis Cardinals . Lorenzo Cain drove in Zobrist in to make it a 3 – 2 game . 
 In the eighth inning , after recording the first out , Tyler Clippard walked two consecutive batters to force Terry Collins to bring in Familia . A key fielding error by Daniel Murphy allowed the tying run to score . The Royals took the lead on an RBI single from Moustakas , and then Pérez added an insurance run with another RBI base hit to give Kansas City the 5 – 3 lead . For Familia , it was his second blown save of the series , and second out of seven opportunities this postseason , though this one could be partly attributed to Murphy 's error . Wade Davis converted a two @-@ inning save for the Royals , his fourth overall this postseason . Davis pitched a perfect eighth , but got into some trouble with one out in the ninth when Murphy hit a hard grounder that Moustakas couldn 't field cleanly , and then Céspedes got a base hit to bring the winning run to the plate in Duda . However , Duda hit a soft line drive that was caught by Moustakas , who then doubled off Céspedes at first base to end the game . Céspedes had started running thinking that the ball would hit the ground .

 Vólquez returned to the Dominican Republic for his father 's funeral the day after Game 1 , but returned to the Royals in time to start Game 5 . Harvey started for the Mets . Tony Bennett performed " America the Beautiful " , and the first pitch was thrown by Cleon Jones , Mookie Wilson , and Darryl Strawberry . 
 Granderson led off the first inning with a home run for the Mets , and scored the Mets ' second run in the sixth inning . The Mets had a chance to break the game open in that sixth inning as they loaded the bases with no outs , but had to settle for one run after Céspedes lined a foul ball off his leg and was injured , leaving the game after popping up for the first out of the inning . Duda hit a sacrifice fly before d 'Arnaud grounded out to end the inning . Harvey pitched eight shutout innings for the Mets , and convinced Collins to keep him in the game for the ninth . He then gave up a leadoff walk to Cain in the ninth inning , and the Royals got a run when Hosmer drove Cain in with a double , prompting Collins to call upon Familia to relieve Harvey . After a groundout by Moustakas advanced Hosmer to third base with one out , Pérez hit a ground ball to third baseman Wright , who after checking Hosmer at third , threw to first base for the second out ; however , Hosmer broke for home as soon as the ball was thrown , and Duda , who fielded the out at first , threw wide at home attempting to throw Hosmer out , and the latter scored the tying run , resulting in Familia blowing his third save of the postseason and the series ; his eight save opportunities tied the postseason record set in 2002 by Robb Nen . 
 In the top of the 12th inning , with Addison Reed pitching for the Mets , Pérez hit a single for the Royals . Pinch running for Pérez , Dyson stole a base and scored on a single by pinch hitter Christian Colón . Colón scored on a hit by Escobar . The Royals loaded the bases , and Cain drove home three more runs with a double off of Bartolo Colón . Davis pitched a shutout inning for the Royals to complete the series and win the championship . He struck out Flores looking to end the game , series , and baseball season . 
 Pérez , who batted 8 @-@ for @-@ 22 ( .364 ) in the series , and caught every inning for the Royals with the exception of the final inning of the series , won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award . He became the first catcher to win the award since Pat Borders won it in the 1992 World Series , and the second Venezuelan player , following Pablo Sandoval , who won it in the 2012 World Series .

 This was the first World Series in which both teams were expansion teams , which are teams that were formed after the 1960 season ; the Mets began play in 1962 , while the Royals began play in 1969 . Additionally , they have been the most successful expansion teams in the major leagues : the Mets and Royals were the first expansion teams in their respective leagues to not only win a league championship pennant ( 1969 for the Mets and 1980 for the Royals ) but the World Series as well ( the Mets in 1969 and the Royals in 1985 ) ; with five and four pennants respectively , they are the only expansion franchises with more than two league titles . Each team was also seeking to end a long championship drought ; the Royals ' previous championship was in 1985 , with the Mets ' last title coming one year later in 1986 . The Mets and Royals met on Opening Day of the 2016 season , on April 3 , 2016 , for a Sunday night game of the 2016 season in Kansas City .

 = Mycena multiplicata = 
 Mycena multiplicata is a species of mushroom in the Mycenaceae family . First described as a new species in 2007 , the mushroom is known only from Kanagawa , Japan , where it grows on dead fallen twigs in lowland forests dominated by oak . The mushroom has a whitish cap that reaches up to 13 mm ( 0 @.@ 51 in ) in diameter atop a slender stem 15 to 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 to 0 @.@ 79 in ) long by 1 to 1 @.@ 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 039 to 0 @.@ 051 in ) thick . On the underside of the cap are whitish , distantly spaced gills that are narrowly attached to the stem . Microscopic characteristics of the mushroom include the amyloid spores ( turning bluish @-@ black to black in the presence of Melzer 's reagent ) , the pear @-@ shaped to broadly club @-@ shaped cheilocystidia ( cystidia found on the gill edge ) covered with a few to numerous , unevenly spaced , cylindrical protuberances , the lack of pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the gill face ) , and the diverticulate hyphae in the outer layer of the cap and stem . The edibility of the mushroom is unknown . 
 = = Taxonomy , naming , and classification = = 
 The mushroom was first collected by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi in 1999 , and reported as a new species in a 2007 , along with seven other Japanese Mycenas . The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word multiplicata , meaning " multiplicative " . Its Japanese name is <unk> @-@ <unk> ( <unk> ) . 
 Takahashi suggests that the mushroom is best classified in the section Mycena of the genus Mycena , as defined by Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of M. multiplicata is conical to convex to bell @-@ shaped , reaching 7 to 13 mm ( 0 @.@ 28 to 0 @.@ 51 in ) in diameter . It is often shallowly grooved toward the margin , dry , and somewhat hygrophanous ( changing color when it loses or absorbs water ) . The cap surface is initially pruinose ( appearing as if covered with a fine white powder ) , but soon becomes smooth . The cap color is whitish , sometimes pale brownish at the center . The white flesh is up to 0 @.@ 3 mm thick , and does not have any distinctive taste or odor . The slender stem is 15 to 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 to 0 @.@ 79 in ) long by 1 to 1 @.@ 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 039 to 0 @.@ 051 in ) thick , cylindrical , centrally attached to the cap , and hollow . Its surface is dry , pruinose near the top , and covered with fine , soft hairs toward the base . It is whitish to grayish @-@ violet near the top , gradually becoming dark violet below . The stem base is covered with long , fairly coarse , whitish fibrils . The gills are narrowly attached to the stem , distantly spaced ( between 13 and 16 gills reach the stem ) , up to 1 @.@ 7 mm broad , thin , and whitish , with the gill edges the same color as the gill faces . The edibility of the mushroom has not been determined .

The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are 24 – 31 by 6 @.@ 5 – 7 @.@ 5 µm , club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored , and have clamps at the basal septa . The cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge ) are abundant , pear @-@ shaped to broadly club @-@ shaped , and measure 17 – 28 by 11 – 20 µm . They are covered with a few to numerous excrescences ( outgrowths ) that are 2 – 18 by 1 – 3 µm , colorless , and thin @-@ walled . The excrescences are unevenly spaced , simple to somewhat branched , cylindrical , and straight or curved . There are no pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the gill face ) in this species . The hymenophoral ( gill @-@ producing ) tissue is made of thin @-@ walled hyphae that are 7 – 20 µm wide , cylindrical ( but often inflated ) , smooth , hyaline ( translucent ) , and dextrinoid ( staining reddish to reddish @-@ brown in Melzer 's reagent ) . The cap cuticle is made of parallel , bent @-@ over hyphae that are 3 – 5 µm wide , cylindrical , and covered with simple to highly branched colorless diverticulae that have thin walls .

 = Chetco River = 
 The Chetco River is a 56 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 90 km ) stream located in the southwestern portion of the U.S. state of Oregon . It drains approximately 352 square miles ( 912 km2 ) of Curry County . Flowing through a rugged and isolated coastal region , it descends rapidly from about 3 @,@ 200 feet ( 975 m ) to sea level at the Pacific Ocean . Except for the lowermost 5 miles ( 8 km ) , the river is located entirely within the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest . The river rises in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness , northwest of Chetco Peak at the junction of the Oregon Coast Range and the Klamath Mountains . It flows generally north , west , and then southwest , before emptying into the ocean between Brookings and Harbor , approximately 6 miles ( 10 km ) north of the California state line . The Chetco River 's watershed remains largely undeveloped , protected by the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest and the Kalmiopsis Wilderness . The upper 45 miles ( 72 km ) of the river have been designated Wild and Scenic since 1988 . 
 Native Americans have lived in the Chetco River 's watershed for the last one to three thousand years . Several explorers , including Sir Francis Drake , George Vancouver , and Jedediah Smith , visited the region between the 16th and 19th centuries , and found the Chetco people inhabiting the area . Non @-@ indigenous settlers arrived soon after gold and other precious metals were discovered in the 1840s and 1850s . The town of Brookings was founded in the early 20th century , and incorporated in 1951 . Fourteen thousand residents of Brookings and Harbor rely on the Chetco for drinking water . 
 Supporting a large population of salmon and trout , the Chetco 's water is of very high quality . The watershed is home to many other species , including several that are endemic to the Siskiyou Mountains area . The northernmost grove of Redwoods — the tallest trees on Earth — grow in the southern region of the Chetco 's drainage basin . In total , the river is home to over 200 species of animals , and 97 percent of the watershed is forested . 
 = = Course = = 
 The Chetco River begins about 4 miles ( 6 km ) east of Chetco Peak , approximately 3 @,@ 201 feet ( 975 @.@ 7 m ) above sea level . It flows north , gathering small tributaries such as the Little Chetco River and <unk> Creek . The river turns west near the 5 @,@ 098 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 1 @,@ 554 m ) <unk> Peak , the highest point in the watershed . It receives Box Canyon Creek on the left bank , <unk> Creek on the right bank , and Boulder Creek on the left . It then flows south , gathering the South Fork Chetco River . A few miles farther south , the river passes through a Redwood grove . It flows between Bosley Butte to the north and Mount Emily to the south ; the latter is the impact site of one of only four bombs known to have been dropped in the continental United States by an enemy aircraft . This occurred during the Lookout Air Raids of 1942 . 
 Turning southwest , the river flows through Alfred A. Loeb State Park and collects the North Fork Chetco River on the right at river mile ( RM ) 5 ( or river kilometer ( RK ) 8 ) . The Chetco becomes an estuary about 1 @.@ 7 miles ( 2 @.@ 7 km ) from its mouth . It passes through the communities of Brookings to the north and Harbor to the south , and discharges into the Pacific Ocean .

 The United States Geological Survey monitors the flow of the Chetco River at a stream gauge at RM 10 @.@ 7 ( RK 17 @.@ 2 ) , which is 6 @.@ 8 miles ( 11 km ) northeast of Brookings . It opened in 1969 , and continues to operate . The average flow was 2 @,@ 263 cubic feet per second ( 64 @.@ 08 m3 / s ) from a drainage area of 271 square miles ( 702 km2 ) , about 77 percent of the Chetco 's total drainage basin . The maximum recorded flow was 85 @,@ 400 cubic feet per second ( 2 @,@ 420 m3 / s ) on December 22 , 1964 , during the Pacific Northwest flood of 1964 . The minimum flow was 42 cubic feet per second ( 1 @.@ 2 m3 / s ) on October 14 , 1987 .

 The Chetco River drains 352 square miles ( 912 km2 ) of the southern Oregon Coast . About 78 percent is owned by the United States Forest Service , and another 5 percent is owned by the Bureau of Land Management . Sixteen percent is privately owned , while the remaining one percent is managed by the cities of Brookings and Harbor , Curry County , and the state of Oregon . Approximately 97 percent of the land is used for forestry , 2 percent for agriculture and rural areas , and 1 percent is urban . Gravel and minerals are mined from the lower and upper regions of the watershed , respectively . 
 The region is mostly mountainous , characterized by steep river valleys . Elevations in the Chetco River watershed range from sea level to 5 @,@ 098 feet ( 1 @,@ 554 m ) at the summit of <unk> Peak . Precipitation averages between 45 and 140 inches ( 1 @,@ 143 and 3 @,@ 556 mm ) per year , with October through June being the wettest months . Seventy percent of surface runoff is collected from rain , and 30 percent from rain on snow . Twenty @-@ five separate wetlands totaling 93 acres ( 38 ha ) have been identified in the watershed . Temperatures average between 32 and 82 ° F ( 0 and 28 ° C ) , although the Brookings effect ( or Chetco effect ; similar to a foehn wind ) often brings localized hot weather to the Brookings area . The increase in temperature is caused by the geography of the region ; cool air funnels down the Chetco River valley from the Siskiyou and Coast ranges , gradually heating up before eventually reaching Brookings as a warm wind . The mountains also shield the area from cool marine layers . Partially as a result of this phenomenon , Brookings recorded its highest temperature ever , 108 ° F ( 42 ° C ) , on July 8 , 2008 . 
 Earthquakes are common , and large @-@ scale ones occur around every 300 years . The Cascadia earthquake of 1700 — estimated at 8 @.@ 7 – 9 @.@ 2 on the moment magnitude scale — caused a tsunami to sweep across California , Oregon , Washington , and British Columbia , reaching Japan the next day . It was produced when the entire Cascadia subduction zone , about 680 miles ( 1 @,@ 100 km ) long , slipped approximately 66 feet ( 20 m ) in a megathrust event . Another major earthquake occurred in 1873 near present @-@ day Brookings . With a magnitude of 7 @.@ 3 , the quake was felt from Seattle to San Francisco . Wind is also a factor in the region ; storms can sometimes reach over 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) . The Columbus Day Storm of 1962 brought devastating winds to nearly all of Oregon ; nearby Port Orford recorded gusts exceeding 190 miles per hour ( 310 km / h ) . The storm killed 38 people across the state and caused over $ 200 million worth of damage . The watershed often experiences wildfires , some of them major . The Biscuit Fire of 2002 burned over 500 @,@ 000 acres ( 200 @,@ 000 ha ) of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness and surrounding regions . 
 As of the 2010 census , the city of Brookings had a population of 6 @,@ 336 , while nearby Harbor had 2 @,@ 391 . In total , over 14 @,@ 000 residents of the Brookings – Harbor area depend on the Chetco River for drinking water . Nearby watersheds include the <unk> and Smith rivers to the south , the Pistol River to the north , and the Illinois River , a tributary of the Rogue River , to the north and east . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 The Chetco River watershed is covered primarily by temperate coniferous forest , which includes species such as Douglas fir , western hemlock , white fir , Port Orford cedar , California incense cedar , and Sitka spruce . Jeffrey pine , knobcone pine , and golden chinquapin have also been identified . <unk> including tanoak , bigleaf maple , red alder , and Pacific madrone are common . Manzanita , hazelnut , vine maple , western skunk cabbage , and multiple species of berries and grasses make up the understory . Kalmiopsis , a flowering evergreen shrub and the namesake of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness , only grows in the Siskiyou Mountains . Several noxious weeds have also been identified , including gorse , Scotch broom , blackberries , and thistles . 
 The most prevalent species of the extreme southern portion of the watershed is the coastal redwood , one of the tallest types of trees on Earth . The world 's northernmost redwood grove is located near the south bank of the Chetco at RM 15 ( RK 24 ) , about 8 miles ( 10 km ) north of the California border . Trees here are around 300 to 800 years old , 5 to 13 feet ( 2 to 4 m ) in diameter , and some exceed 300 feet ( 91 m ) tall . The redwoods were heavily logged in the early 20th century . Prior to logging , the massive trees created their own microclimate by capturing moisture from fog , and also by the immense amount of shade they produced . The redwoods region is less mountainous than the rest of the watershed , and meandering streams are much more common . 
 Over 200 species of animals inhabit the river and its tributaries . Birds such as loons , grebes , ducks , kingfishers , and bald eagles are known to live around streams and other regions of the watershed . <unk> , gulls , and terns have been spotted around the river 's mouth , and black @-@ legged kittiwakes nest in the area during the winter . The wildlife in the Kalmiopsis region of the Chetco watershed is more diverse than that of any other region in Oregon . Mammals such as American black bears , black @-@ tailed deer , bobcats , ring @-@ tailed cats , and gray foxes are common inhabitants of this region . The rare Siskiyou chipmunk is endemic to the Klamath Mountains . Steelhead and chinook and coho salmon are the most common anadromous fish that inhabit the Chetco River . Steelhead are abundant and have been spotted in most major and minor streams . Chinook salmon usually travel as far as Boulder Creek , about halfway between the Chetco 's headwaters and its mouth . Coho also generally stay in this area , but some have been found in the Granite and Carter Creek area , about 12 miles ( 19 km ) above Boulder Creek . Coastal cutthroat trout can be found all around the watershed ; some migrate to the ocean , while others live in the river and its tributaries year round . Pacific lamprey , three @-@ spined stickleback , and various sculpins have also been observed . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The Chetco River flows through the ancient Klamath Mountain terrane , which is between 400 and 100 million years old , the oldest rocks in Oregon . The Klamath microcontinent was originally located beneath the ocean near southern California before separating hundreds of millions of years ago . Plate tectonics pushed the microcontinent north , and bits of granite , sea floor sediment , subduction zones , and coral reefs gradually accreted into small islands . Between 212 and 170 million years ago , a massive volcanic arc erupted on the Klamath microcontinent , binding the islands together in a single block . The Klamath microcontinent went through a period of intense tectonic activity known as the Siskiyou orogeny roughly 170 to 165 million years ago . The process was strong enough to force sedimentary rocks deep into the Earth 's crust , melting them into large plutons of granite , which rose slowly to the surface . Shortly after , a large portion of sea floor was thrust over the older Klamath terranes ; much of it is still visible atop Vulcan and Chetco peaks . This region is known as the Josephine <unk> , and contains a rare type of rock called peridotite , originating from the Earth 's mantle . 
 The mountainous terrain of the Chetco River watershed was created approximately 130 million years ago when the microcontinent collided with the much larger North American continent . The process uplifted the complex and exotic terranes of the microcontinent to form the Klamath Mountains . Many glaciers carved U @-@ shaped valleys and cirques during the last ice age , and several alpine lakes still exist today . 
 Today , sandstone , shale , granite , and serpentine are the primary rock types in the Chetco region . Various forms of loam comprise its soil . Erosion levels are high due to a combination of high precipitation , steep slopes , and landslides , which can result in earthflows . 
 = = History = = 
 Humans have lived in the Chetco River watershed since approximately 1 @,@ 000 to 3 @,@ 000 years ago . The first inhabitants were perhaps ancestors of the Chetco Indians and other Native American tribes , themselves descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land bridge from Siberia over 10 @,@ 000 years ago . At least nine separate villages were constructed along the Chetco River , including two on either side of its mouth . The Native Americans named the river " chit <unk> @-@ <unk> ~ -li ~ ’ " . 
 The first European American to visit the area may have been Sir Francis Drake on June 5 , 1579 , during his circumnavigation of the world . The Vancouver Expedition also explored the area in 1792 . In June 1828 Jedediah Smith and his company of fur traders camped on the south bank of the river near a Native American village . Between 1853 and 1855 , many Native Americans were killed and their villages destroyed in skirmishes occurring around the same time as the nearby Rogue River Wars . On July 9 , 1856 , the remaining Chetco were marched north to the Siletz Reservation . 
 Oregon — and therefore the Chetco watershed — was jointly occupied by the United Kingdom and the United States after the Treaty of 1818 was signed . The Oregon Treaty was ratified in 1846 , giving the United States ownership of Oregon . Soon after , the Oregon Territory was established , and Oregon became a U.S. state on February 14 , 1859 . 
 The discovery of gold and other precious metals in the watershed brought settlers to the region in the 1840s and 1850s . Nickel , cobalt , and chromium were also mined . The town of Harbor was founded on the south bank of the Chetco River in 1891 , and a ferry service across the river opened in 1904 . It was shut down in 1915 when the Chetco Bridge opened . In 1912 , the Brookings Lumber & Box Company moved north from the San Bernardino Mountains in southern California to the southern Oregon coast region . The company constructed a sawmill in 1914 , and founded the town of Brookings . Brookings was not incorporated until 1951 . The region remained relatively isolated due to its mountainous terrain until 1924 , when Highway 101 was extended from Crescent City , California , to Brookings . In 1932 , the Isaac Lee Patterson Bridge was completed over the Rogue River to the north , connecting the region to the rest of the Oregon coast . In 1917 , a 1 @,@ 200 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 366 m ) wharf was built at the mouth of the river . Jetties were constructed on either side of its mouth by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1957 . 
 The Siskiyou National Forest was created on October 5 , 1906 , protecting the entire upper portion of the Chetco watershed . The nearby Rogue River National Forest was combined with it in 2004 , creating the nearly 1 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 728 @,@ 000 ha ) Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest . In 1964 , the United States Congress set aside over 80 @,@ 000 acres ( 32 @,@ 000 ha ) of the eastern Chetco River watershed and surrounding regions to create the Kalmiopsis Wilderness . The wilderness was expanded several times in the 1970s , and now encompasses over 180 @,@ 000 acres ( 72 @,@ 800 ha ) . 
 On October 28 , 1988 , a 44 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 71 @.@ 6 km ) stretch of the Chetco River was designated a National Wild and Scenic River , from its headwaters to the boundary of the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest . In a court case in 1994 , the Chetco was determined to be navigable . In 2002 , over 500 @,@ 000 acres ( 202 @,@ 000 ha ) of the eastern portion of the watershed and surrounding regions were destroyed in the Biscuit Fire . Originally five separate fires , it was caused by several lightning strikes between July 12 and 15 . By August 17 , all five had burned together , creating one massive fire . It burned for over five months and was not fully extinguished until December 31 . 
 In 2002 , 45 acres ( 18 ha ) of land on the Little Chetco River were sold to Washington real estate developer David Rutan , only several months after the Biscuit Fire tore through the region . He opened a gold mining camp on the site in 2007 , flying in customers by helicopter . Curry County officials soon stated that the camp violated zoning and sanitation laws , but inspections were stymied because of the area 's inaccessibility . Rutan bought several more claims in the Wild and Scenic section of the Chetco River in the following years , beginning 6 miles ( 10 km ) inside the Kalmiopsis Wilderness , and ending 24 miles ( 39 km ) downstream . Despite environmentalists ' concerns , he proposed mining the Chetco riverbed for gold and minerals via commercial suction dredges , permitted by the General Mining Act of 1872 . In 2010 , the Chetco River was identified as the seventh most endangered river in America by advocacy organization American Rivers , facing a threat of " motorized instream mining " . Oregon 's governor , Ted Kulongoski , two senators , Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley , and congressman Peter <unk> all asked the United States Department of Agriculture to withdraw the Chetco River from the 1872 Mining Act , thus preventing mineral mining on the river . However , Rutan forfeited his claims by not paying his annual filing fees to the Bureau of Land Management in 2011 .

 The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality ( DEQ ) has monitored the Chetco River for eight different parameters that affect water quality : temperature , oxygen saturation , pH , nutrients , bacteria , chemical contaminants such as pesticides and metals , turbidity , and alkalinity . Streams that exceed the standard level are then placed on the DEQ 303d list in accordance with the Clean Water Act . The Chetco from Box Canyon Creek to its mouth exceeded the standard level for temperature and turbidity . The North Fork , South Fork , and other tributaries were also listed for temperature and turbidity . All tributaries of the Chetco usually exceed the 64 ° F ( 18 ° C ) temperature standard . Water temperatures range from 62 @.@ 6 ° F ( 17 @.@ 0 ° C ) at Bosley Creek to 76 ° F ( 24 ° C ) at Willow Bar . High turbidity levels in the Chetco River watershed are usually caused by landslides , various forms of erosion , and plugged road culverts . 
 On the Oregon Water Quality Index ( OWQI ) used by DEQ , water quality scores can vary from 10 ( worst ) to 100 ( ideal ) . The average for the Chetco River at RM 10 @.@ 8 ( RK 17 @.@ 4 ) between 1998 and 2007 was 95 ( excellent ) in the summer and 90 in the fall , winter , and spring . These scores are comparable to the 1986 to 1995 results of 94 and 93 . Despite the excellent ratings , the Chetco River actually ranks as the second most polluted stream in Curry County , after nearby Floras Creek , a tributary of the New River . 
 = = Recreation = = 
 Fishing , four @-@ wheel driving , swimming , boating , camping , sightseeing , and picnicking are the primary recreational activities in the watershed . Whitewater kayaking is also popular in the winter months when water levels are high . Several trails are maintained throughout the Kalmiopsis Wilderness , as well as other regions in the watershed . Eight boat launches are located on the river between its confluence with the south fork and its mouth . Alfred A. Loeb State Park , located on the banks of the Chetco , has three cabins and 48 camping sites . 
 Several large parks are located in Brookings . The 33 @-@ acre ( 13 ha ) Azalea Park in Brookings features five species of wild azaleas . The park was designated an Oregon State Park in 1939 , but was given to Brookings in 1993 . It hosts the American Music Festival from June until September . The Nature 's Coastal Holiday light show is displayed in Azalea Park every December . Chetco Point Park , located near the wharf , has several fire rings and picnic tables , as well as views of the river , the Pacific Ocean , and the Port of Brookings Harbor . It is home to the rare Wolf 's Evening Primrose . 
 = Ken Livingstone = 
 Kenneth Robert " Ken " Livingstone ( born 17 June 1945 ) is an English politician who served as the Leader of the Greater London Council ( GLC ) from 1981 until the council was abolished in 1986 , and as Mayor of London from the creation of the office in 2000 until 2008 . He also served as the Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Brent East from 1987 to 2001 . A suspended member of the Labour Party , he was on the party 's hard left , ideologically identifying as a democratic socialist . 
 Born in Lambeth , South London , to a working @-@ class family , Livingstone joined Labour in 1968 and was elected to represent Norwood at the GLC in 1973 , Hackney North and Stoke Newington in 1977 , and Paddington in 1981 , when he was elected leader of the GLC by Labour members . Attempting to reduce London Underground fares , his plans were challenged in court and declared unlawful ; more successful were his schemes to benefit women and underprivileged minorities , despite stiff opposition . Livingstone was heavily criticised in the mainstream media for supporting controversial issues like republicanism , LGBT rights , and a United Ireland , and given the moniker " Red Ken " . Livingstone was a vocal opponent of the Conservative Party government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , which in 1986 abolished the GLC . Elected as MP for Brent East in 1987 , he became closely associated with anti @-@ racist campaigns . He unsuccessfully stood for Labour Party leader on a leftist platform in 1992 and 1994 , and became a vocal critic of Tony Blair 's New Labour project that pushed the party to the centre . 
 After failing to become Labour 's candidate in the 2000 London mayoral election , Livingstone successfully contested the election as an independent candidate . In his first term as Mayor of London , he introduced the congestion charge , Oyster card , and articulated buses , and unsuccessfully opposed the government 's privatisation of London Underground . Despite his opposition to Blair 's government on issues like the Iraq War , Livingstone was invited to stand for re @-@ election as Labour 's candidate and was re @-@ elected in 2004 , expanding his transport policies , introducing new environmental regulations , and enacting civil rights policies . Initiating and overseeing London 's winning bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics and ushering in a major redevelopment of the city 's East End , his leadership after the 7 July 2005 London bombings was widely praised . He stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate in London 's mayoral elections of 2008 and 2012 , losing both to the Conservative candidate Boris Johnson . 
 Characterised as " the only truly successful Left @-@ wing British politician of modern times " , Livingstone is a highly controversial figure in British politics . Supporters lauded his efforts to improve rights for women , LGBT people , and ethnic minorities in London , but critics accused him of cronyism and antisemitism and lambasted his connections to Islamists , Marxists , and Irish republicans .

 = = = Childhood and young adulthood : 1945 – 1967 = = = 
 Livingstone was born in his grandmother 's house in Lambeth , south London , on 17 June 1945 . His family was working class ; his mother , Ethel Ada ( née Kennard , 1915 – 1997 ) , had been born in Southwark before training as an acrobatic dancer and working on the music hall circuit prior to the Second World War . Ken 's Scottish father , Robert " Bob " Moffat Livingstone ( 1915 – 1971 ) , had been born in Dunoon before joining the Merchant Navy in 1932 and becoming ship 's master . 
 Having first met in April 1940 at a music hall in Workington , they married within three months . After the war the couple moved in with Ethel 's aggressive mother , Zona Ann ( Williams ) , whom Livingstone considered " tyrannical " . Livingstone 's sister Lin was born 21 ⁄ 2 years later . Robert and Ethel went through various jobs in the post @-@ war years , with the former working on fishing trawlers and English Channel ferries , while the latter worked in a bakers , at Freemans catalogue dispatch and as a cinema usherette . Livingstone 's parents were " working class Tories " , and unlike many Conservative voters at the time did not hold to socially conservative views on race and sexuality , opposing racism and homophobia . The family was nominally Anglican , although Livingstone abandoned Christianity when he was 11 , becoming an atheist . 
 Moving to a Tulse Hill council housing estate , Livingstone attended St. Leonard 's Primary School , and after failing his eleven plus exam , in 1956 began secondary education at Tulse Hill Comprehensive School . In 1957 , his family purchased their own property at 66 Wolfington Road , West Norwood . Rather shy at school , he was bullied , and got into trouble for truancy . One year , his form master was Philip <unk> , who encouraged his pupils to debate current events , first interesting Livingstone in politics . He related that he became " an argumentative cocky little brat " at home , bringing up topics at the dinner table to enrage his father . His interest in politics was furthered by the 1958 Papal election of Pope John XXIII – a man who had " a strong impact " on Livingstone – and the United States presidential election , 1960 . At Tulse Hill Comprehensive he gained his interest in amphibians and reptiles , keeping several as pets ; his mother worried that rather than focusing on school work all he cared about was " his pet lizard and friends " . At school he attained four O @-@ levels in English Literature , English Language , Geography and Art , subjects he later described as " the easy ones " . He started work rather than stay on for the non @-@ compulsory sixth form , which required six O @-@ levels . 
 From 1962 @-@ 70 , he worked as a technician at the Chester Beatty cancer research laboratory in Fulham , looking after animals used in experimentation . Most of the technicians were socialists , and Livingstone helped found a branch of the Association of Scientific , Technical and Managerial Staffs to fight redundancies imposed by company bosses . Livingstone 's leftist views solidified upon the election of Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson in 1964 . With a friend from Chester Beatty , Livingstone toured West Africa in 1966 , visiting Algeria , Niger , Nigeria , Lagos , Ghana and Togo . Interested in the region 's wildlife , Livingstone rescued an infant ostrich from being eaten , donating it to Lagos children 's zoo . Returning home , he took part in several protest marches as a part of the anti @-@ Vietnam War movement , becoming increasingly interested in politics and briefly subscribing to the publication of a libertarian socialist group , Solidarity . 
 = = = Political activism : 1968 – 1970 = = = 
 Livingstone joined the Labour Party in March 1968 , when he was 23 years old , later describing it as " one of the few recorded instances of a rat climbing aboard a sinking ship " . At the time , many leftists were leaving in disgust at the Labour government 's support for the U.S. in the Vietnam War , cuts to the National Health Service budget , and restrictions on trade unions ; many went on to join far @-@ left parties like the International Socialists and the Socialist Labour League , or single @-@ issue groups like the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Child Poverty Action Group . Suffering mass electoral defeat at the local elections , in London , Labour lost 15 boroughs , including Livingstone 's London Borough of Lambeth , which came under Conservative control . Contrastingly , Livingstone believed that grassroots campaigning – such as the 1968 student protests – were ineffective , joining Labour because he considered it the best chance for implementing progressive political change in the UK . 
 Joining his local Labour branch in Norwood , he involved himself in their operations , within a month becoming chair and secretary of the Norwood Young Socialists , gaining a place on the constituency 's General Management and Executive Committees , and sitting on the Local Government Committee who prepared Labour 's manifesto for the next borough election . Hoping for better qualifications , he attended night school , gaining O @-@ levels in Human Anatomy , Physiology and Hygiene , and an A @-@ level in Zoology . Leaving his job at Chester Beatty , in September 1970 he began a 3 @-@ year course at the Philippa Fawcett Teacher Training College ( <unk> ) in Streatham ; his attendance was poor , and he considered it " a complete waste " of time . Beginning a romantic relationship with Christine Chapman , president of the <unk> student 's union , the couple married in 1973 . 
 Realising the Conservative governance of Lambeth Borough council was hard to unseat , Livingstone aided Eddie Lopez in reaching out to members of the local populace disenfranchised from the traditional Labour leadership . Associating with the leftist Schools ' Action Union ( <unk> ) founded in the wake of the 1968 student protests , he encouraged members of the Brixton branch of the Black Panther Party to join Labour . His involvement in the <unk> led to his dismissal from the <unk> student 's union , who disagreed with politicising secondary school pupils . 
 = = = Lambeth Housing Committee : 1971 – 1973 = = = 
 In 1971 , Livingstone and his comrades developed a new strategy for obtaining political power in Lambeth borough . Focusing on campaigning for the marginal seats in the south of the borough , the safe Labour seats in the north were left to established party members . Public dissatisfaction with the Conservative government of Prime Minister Edward Heath led to Labour 's best local government results since the 1940s ; Labour leftists gained every marginal seat in Lambeth , and the borough returned to Labour control . In October 1971 , Livingstone 's father died of a heart attack ; his mother soon moved to Lincoln . That year , Labour members voted Livingstone Vice @-@ Chairman of the Housing Committee on the Lambeth London Borough Council , his first job in local government . Reforming the housing system , Livingstone and Committee Chairman Ewan Carr cancelled the proposed rent increase for council housing , temporarily halting the construction of Europe 's largest tower blocks , and founded a Family <unk> Group to ensure that homeless families would be immediately rehoused through squatting in empty houses . He increased the number of compulsory purchase orders for private @-@ rented properties , converting them to council housing . They faced opposition to their reforms , which were cancelled by central government . 
 Livingstone and the leftists became embroiled in factional in @-@ fighting within Labour , vying for powerful positions with centrist members . Although never adopting Marxism , Livingstone became involved with a number of Trotskyist groups active within Labour ; viewing them as potential allies , he became friends with Chris Knight , Graham Bash and Keith Veness , members of the Socialist Charter , a Trotskyist cell affiliated with the Revolutionary Communist League that had infiltrated the Labour party . In his struggle against Labour centrists , Livingstone was influenced by Trotskyist Ted Knight , who convinced him to oppose the use of British troops in Northern Ireland , believing they would simply be used to quash nationalist protests against British rule . Livingstone stood as the leftist candidate for the Chair of the Lambeth Housing Committee in April 1973 , but was defeated by David Stimpson , who undid many of Livingston and Carr 's reforms . 
 = = = Early years on the Greater London Council : 1973 – 1977 = = = 
 In June 1972 , after a campaign orchestrated by Eddie Lopez , Livingstone was selected as the Labour candidate for Norwood in the Greater London Council ( GLC ) . In the 1973 GLC elections , he won the seat with 11 @,@ 622 votes , a firm lead over his Conservative rival . Led by Reg Goodwin , the GLC was dominated by Labour , who controlled 57 seats , compared to 33 controlled by the Conservatives and 2 by the Liberal Party . Of the Labour GLC members , around 16 , including Livingstone , were staunch leftists . Representing Norwood in the GLC , Livingstone continued as a Lambeth councillor and Vice Chairman of the Lambeth Housing Committee , criticising Lambeth council 's dealings with the borough 's homeless . Learning that the council had pursued a racist policy of allocating the best housing to white working @-@ class families , Livingstone went public with the evidence , which was published in the South London Press . In August 1973 , he publicly threatened to resign from the Lambeth Housing Committee if the council failed " to honour longstanding promises " to rehouse 76 homeless families then staying in dilapidated and overcrowded halfway accommodation . Frustrated at the council 's failure to achieve this , he resigned from the Housing Committee in December 1973 . 
 Considered a radical troublemaker by the GLC 's Labour management , Livingstone was allocated the relatively unimportant position of Vice Chairman of the Film Viewing Board , monitoring the release of soft pornography . Like most Board members , Livingstone opposed cinematic censorship , a view he changed with the increasing availability of violent pornography . With growing support from Labour leftists , in March 1974 he was elected onto the executive of the Greater London Labour Party ( <unk> ) , responsible for drawing up the manifesto for the GLC Labour group and the lists of candidates for council and parliamentary seats . Turning his attention once more to housing , he became Vice Chairman of the GLC 's Housing Management Committee , however was sacked in April 1975 for his vocal opposition to the Goodwin administration 's decision to cut £ 50 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 from the GLC 's house @-@ building budget . Coming up to the 1977 GLC elections , Livingstone recognised the difficulty of retaining his Norwood seat , instead being selected for Hackney North and Stoke Newington , a Labour safe seat , following the retirement of David Pitt . Accused of being a " carpetbagger " , it ensured he was one of the few leftist Labour councillors to remain on the GLC , which fell into Conservative hands under Horace Cutler . 
 = = = Hampstead : 1977 – 1980 = = = 
 Turning towards the Houses of Parliament , Livingstone and Christine moved to West Hampstead , north London ; in June 1977 he was selected by local party members as the Labour parliamentary candidate for the Hampstead constituency , beating Vince Cable . He gained notoriety in the Hampstead and Highgate Express for publicly reaffirming his support for the controversial issue of LGBT rights , declaring he supported the reduction of the age of consent for male same @-@ sex activity from 21 to 16 , in line with the different @-@ sex age of consent . Becoming active in the politics of the London Borough of Camden , Livingstone was elected Chair of Camden 's Housing Committee ; putting forward radical reforms , he democratized council housing meetings by welcoming local people , froze rents for a year , reformed the rate collection system , changed rent arrears procedures and implemented further compulsory purchase orders to increase council housing . Criticised by some senior colleagues as incompetent and excessively ambitious , some accused him of encouraging leftists to move into the borough 's council housing to increase his local support base . 
 In 1979 , internal crisis rocked Labour as activist group , the Campaign for Labour Democracy , struggled with the Parliamentary Labour Party for a greater say in party management . Livingstone joined the activists , on 15 July 1978 helping unify small hard left groups as the Socialist Campaign for a Labour Victory ( <unk> ) . Producing a sporadically published paper , Socialist Organiser , as a mouthpiece for Livingstone 's views , it criticised Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan as " anti @-@ working class " . In January 1979 , Britain was hit by a series of public sector worker strikes that came to be known as the " Winter of Discontent . " In Camden Borough , council employees <unk> under the National Union of Public Employees ( <unk> ) went on strike , demanding a 35 @-@ hour limit to their working week and a weekly wage increase to £ 60 . Livingstone backed the strikers , urging Camden Council to grant their demands , eventually getting his way . District auditor Ian <unk> , a government @-@ appointed accountant who monitored council finances , claimed that this move was reckless and illegal , taking Camden Council to court . If found guilty , Livingstone would have been held personally responsible for the measure , forced to pay the massive surcharge , and been disqualified for public office for five years ; ultimately the judge threw out the case . 
 In May 1979 , a general election was held in the United Kingdom . Standing as Labour candidate for Hampstead , Livingstone was defeated by the incumbent Conservative , Geoffrey <unk> . Weakened by the Winter of Discontent , Callaghan 's government lost to the Conservatives , whose leader , Margaret Thatcher , became Prime Minister . A staunch right winger and free market advocate , she became a bitter opponent of the labour movement and Livingstone . Following the electoral defeat , Livingstone told Socialist Organiser that the blame lay solely with the " Labour government 's policies " and the anti @-@ democratic attitude of Callaghan and the Parliamentary Labour Party , calling for greater party democracy and a turn towards a socialist platform . This was a popular message among many Labour activists amassed under the <unk> . The primary figurehead for this leftist trend was Tony Benn , who narrowly missed being elected deputy leader of Labour in September 1981 , under new party leader Michael Foot . The head of the " Bennite left " , Benn became " an inspiration and a prophet " to Livingstone ; the two became the best known left @-@ wingers in Labour .

 Inspired by the <unk> , Livingstone planned a GLC take @-@ over ; on 18 October 1979 , he called a meeting of Labour leftists entitled " Taking over the GLC " , beginning publication of monthly newsletter the London Labour Briefing . Focused on increasing leftist power in the London Labour Party , he urged socialists to stand as candidates in the upcoming GLC election . When the time came to choose who would lead London Labour in that election , Livingstone put his name down , but was challenged by the moderate Andrew McIntosh ; in the April 1980 vote , McIntosh beat Livingstone by 14 votes to 13 . In September 1980 , Livingstone separated from his wife Christine , though they remained amicable . Moving into a small flat at 195 Randolph Avenue , Maida Vale with his pet reptiles and amphibians , he divorced in October 1982 and began a relationship with Kate Allen , chair of Camden Council Women 's Committee . 
 Livingstone turned his attention to achieving a GLC Labour victory , exchanging his safe @-@ seat in Hackney North for the marginal Inner London seat at Paddington ; in May 1981 he won the seat by 2 @,@ 397 votes . Cutler and the Conservatives learned of Livingstone 's plans , proclaiming that a GLC Labour victory would lead to a Marxist takeover of London and then Britain ; the rightist press picked up the story , with the Daily Express using the headline of " Why We Must Stop These Red Wreckers " . Such scaremongering was ineffective , and the GLC election of May 1981 was a Labour victory , with McIntosh installed as Head of the GLC ; within 24 hours he would be deposed by members of his own party , replaced by Livingstone . 
 On 7 May , Livingstone called a caucus of his supporters ; announcing his intent to challenge McIntosh 's leadership , he invited those assembled to stand for other GLC posts . The meeting ended at 4 : 45pm having agreed on a full slate of candidates . At 5 o 'clock , McIntosh held a GLC Labour meeting ; the attendees called an immediate leadership election , in which Livingstone defeated him by 30 votes to 20 . The entire left caucus slate was then elected . The next day , a leftist coup deposed Sir Ashley Bramall on the Inner London Education Authority ( ILEA ) , replacing him with Bryn Davies ; the left group now controlled both the GLC and the ILEA . 
 McIntosh proclaimed the GLC coup illegitimate , asserting that Labour was in danger from a leftist take @-@ over . The mainstream right @-@ wing press criticised the coup ; the Daily Mail called Livingstone a " left wing extremist " , and The Sun nicknamed him " Red Ken " , stating his victory meant " full @-@ steam @-@ ahead red @-@ blooded Socialism for London . " The Financial Times issued a " warning " that leftists could use such tactics to take control of the government , when " the erosion of our democracy will surely begin . " Thatcher joined the rallying call , proclaiming that leftists like Livingstone had " no time for parliamentary democracy " , but were plotting " To impose upon this nation a tyranny which the peoples of Eastern Europe yearn to cast aside . " 
 = = = Leader of the GLC : 1981 – 1983 = = = 
 Entering County Hall as GLC leader on 8 May 1981 , Livingstone initiated changes , converting the building 's <unk> temple into a meeting room and removing many of the privileges enjoyed by GLC members and senior officers . He initiated an open @-@ door policy allowing citizens to hold meetings in the committee rooms free of charge , with County Hall gaining the nickname of " the People 's Palace " . Livingstone took great pleasure watching the disgust expressed by some Conservative GLC members when non @-@ members began using the building 's restaurant . In the London Labour Briefing , Livingstone announced " London 's ours ! After the most vicious GLC election of all time , the Labour Party has won a working majority on a radical socialist programme . " He stated that their job was to " sustain a holding operation until such time as the Tory [ Conservative ] government can be brought down and replaced by a left @-@ wing Labour government . " There was a perception among Livingstone 's allies that they constituted the genuine opposition to Thatcher 's government , with Foot 's Labour leadership dismissed as ineffectual ; they hoped Benn would soon replace him . 
 There was a widespread public perception that Livingstone 's GLC leadership was illegitimate , while the mainstream British media remained resolutely hostile to the hard left . Livingstone received the levels of national press attention normally reserved for senior Members of Parliament . A press interview was arranged with Max Hastings for the Evening Standard , in which Livingstone was portrayed as affable but ruthless . The Sun 's editor Kelvin MacKenzie took a particular interest in Livingstone , establishing a reporting team to ' dig up the dirt ' on him ; they were unable to uncover any scandalous information , focusing on his love of amphibians , a personality trait mocked by other media sources . The satirical journal Private Eye referred to him as " Ken <unk> " after Vladimir Lenin , proceeding to erroneously claim that Livingstone received funding from the Libyan Jamahiriya ; suing them for libel , in November 1983 the journal apologised , awarding Livingstone £ 15 @,@ 000 in damages in an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement . 
 During 1982 , Livingstone made new appointments to the GLC governance , with John McDonnell appointed key chair of finance and Valerie Wise chair of the new Women 's Committee , while Sir Ashley Bramall became GLC chairman and Tony <unk> was appointed chair of housing . Others stayed in their former positions , including Dave Wetzel as transport chair and Mike Ward as chair of industry ; thus was created what biographer John Carvel described as " the second Livingstone administration " , leading to a " more calm and supportive environment " . Turning his attention once more to Parliament , Livingstone attempted to get selected as the Labour candidate for the constituency of Brent East , a place which he felt an " affinity " for and where several friends lived . At the time , the Brent East Labour Party was in strife as competing factions battled for control , with Livingstone attempting to gain the support of both the hard and soft left . Securing a significant level of support from local party members , he nonetheless failed to apply for candidacy in time , and so the incumbent centrist Reg Freeson was once more selected as Labour candidate for Brent East . A subsequent vote at the council meeting revealed that 52 local Labour members would have voted for Livingstone , with only 2 for Freeson and 3 abstentions . Nevertheless , in the United Kingdom general election , 1983 , Freeson went on to win the Brent East constituency for Labour . In 1983 , Livingstone began co @-@ presenting a late night television chat show with Janet Street @-@ Porter for London Weekend Television . 
 = = = = Fares Fair and transport policy = = = = 
 The Greater London Labour Manifesto for the 1981 elections , although written under McIntosh 's leadership , had been determined by a special conference of the London Labour Party in October 1980 in which Livingstone 's speech had been decisive on transport policy . The manifesto focused on job creation schemes and cutting London Transport fares , and it was to these issues that Livingstone 's administration turned . One primary manifesto focus had been a pledge known as Fares Fair , which focused on reducing London Underground fares and freezing them at that lower rate . Based on a fare freeze implemented by the South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council in 1975 , it was widely considered to be a moderate and mainstream policy by Labour , which it was hoped would get more Londoners using public transport , thereby reducing congestion . In October 1981 , the GLC implemented their policy , cutting London Transport fares by 32 % ; to fund the move , the GLC planned to increase the London rates . 
 The legality of the Fares Fair policy was challenged by Dennis <unk> , Conservative leader of the London Borough of Bromley council , who complained that his constituents were having to pay for cheaper fares on the London Underground when it did not operate in their borough . Although the Divisional Court initially found in favour of the GLC , Bromley Borough took the issue to a court of appeal , where three judges – Lord Denning , Lord Justice Oliver and Lord Justice Watkins – reversed the previous decision , finding in favour of Bromley Borough on 10 November . They proclaimed that the Fares Fair policy was illegal because the GLC was expressly forbidden from choosing to run London Transport at a deficit , even if this was in the perceived interest of Londoners . The GLC appealed this decision , taking the case to the House of Lords ; on 17 December five Law Lords unanimously ruled in favour of Bromley Borough Council , putting a permanent end to the Fares Fair policy . GLC transport chairman Dave Wetzel labelled the judges " Vandals in Ermine " while Livingstone maintained his belief that the judicial decision was politically motivated . 
 Initially presenting a motion to the GLC Labour groups that they refuse to comply with the judicial decision and continue with the policy regardless , but was out @-@ voted by 32 – 22 ; many commentators claimed that Livingstone had only been bluffing in order to save face among the Labour Left . Instead , Livingstone got on board with a campaign known as " Keep Fares Fair " in order to bring about a change in the law that would make the Fares Fair policy legal ; an alternate movement , " Can 't Pay , Won 't Pay " , accused Livingstone of being a sell @-@ out and insisted that the GLC proceed with its policies regardless of their legality . One aspect of the London Transport reforms was however maintained ; the new system of flat fares within ticket zones , and the inter @-@ modal Travelcard ticket continues as the basis of the ticketing system . The GLC then put together new measures in the hope of reducing London Transport fares by the more modest amount of 25 % , taking them back to roughly the price that they were when Livingstone 's administration took office ; it was ruled legal in January 1983 , and subsequently implemented . 
 = = = = GLEB and nuclear disarmament = = = = 
 Livingstone 's administration founded the Greater London Enterprise Board ( GLEB ) to create employment by investing in the industrial regeneration of London , with the funds provided by the council , its workers ' pension fund and the financial markets . Livingstone later claimed that GLC bureaucrats obstructed much of what GLEB tried to achieve . Other policies implemented by the Labour Left also foundered . Attempts to prevent the sale @-@ off of GLC council housing largely failed , in part due to the strong opposition from the Conservative government . ILEA attempted to carry through with its promise to cut the price of school meals in the capital from <unk> to 25p , but was forced to abandon its plans following legal advice that the councillors could be made to pay the surcharge and disqualified from public office . 
 The Livingstone administration took a strong stance on the issue of nuclear disarmament , proclaiming London a " nuclear @-@ free zone " . On 20 May 1981 , the GLC halted its annual spending of £ 1 million on nuclear war defence plans , with Livingstone 's deputy , Illtyd Harrington , proclaiming that " we are challenging ... the absurd cosmetic approach to Armageddon . " They published the names of the 3000 politicians and administrators who had been earmarked for survival in underground bunkers in the event of a nuclear strike on London . Thatcher 's government remained highly critical of these moves , putting out a propaganda campaign explaining their argument for the necessity of Britain 's nuclear deterrent to counter the Soviet Union . 
 = = = = Egalitarian policies = = = = 
 Livingstone 's administration advocated measures to improve the lives of minorities within London , who together made up a sizeable percentage of the city 's population ; what Reg Race called " the Rainbow Coalition " . The GLC allocated a small percentage of its expenditure on funding minority community groups , including the London Gay Teenage Group , English Collective of Prostitutes , Women Against Rape , Lesbian Line , A Woman 's Place , and Rights of Women . Believing these groups could initiate social change , the GLC increased its annual funding of voluntary organisations from £ 6 million in 1980 to £ 50 million in 1984 . They provided loans to such groups , coming under a barrage of press criticism for awarding a loan to the Sheba Feminist Publishers , whose works were widely labelled pornographic . In July 1981 , Livingstone founded the Ethnic Minorities Committee , the Police Committee , and the Gay and Lesbian Working Party , and in June 1982 , a Women 's Committee was also established . Believing the Metropolitan Police to be a racist organisation , he appointed Paul Boateng to head the Police Committee and monitor the force 's activities . Considering the police a highly political organisation , he publicly remarked that " When you canvas police flats at election time , you find that they are either Conservatives who think of Thatcher as a bit of a pinko or they are National Front . " 
 The Conservatives and mainstream rightist press were largely critical of these measures , considering them symptomatic of what they <unk> termed the " loony left " . Claiming that these only served " fringe " interests , their criticisms often exhibited racist , homophobic and sexist sentiment . A number of journalists fabricated stories designed to discredit Livingstone and the " loony left " , for instance claiming that the GLC made its workers drink only Nicaraguan coffee in solidarity with the country 's socialist government , and that Haringey Council leader Bernie Grant had banned the use of the term " black bin liner " and the rhyme " Baa Baa Black Sheep " because they were perceived as racially insensitive . Writing in 2008 , BBC reporter Andrew Hosken noted that although most of Livingstone 's GLC administration 's policies were ultimately a failure , its role in helping change social attitudes towards women and minorities in London remained its " enduring legacy " . 
 = = = = Republicanism and Ireland = = = = 
 Invited to the Wedding of Charles , Prince of Wales , and Lady Diana Spencer at St Paul 's Cathedral in July 1981 , Livingstone – a republican critical of the monarchy – wished the couple well but turned down the offer . He also permitted Irish republican protesters to hold a vigil on the steps of County Hall throughout the wedding celebrations , both actions that enraged the press . His administration supported the People 's March for Jobs , a demonstration of 500 anti @-@ unemployment protesters who marched to London from Northern England , allowing them to sleep in County Hall and catering for them . Costing £ 19 @,@ 000 , critics argued that Livingstone was illegally using public money for his own political causes . The GLC orchestrated a propaganda campaign against Thatcher 's government , in January 1982 erecting a sign on the top of County Hall – clearly visible from the Houses of Parliament – stating the number of unemployed in London . 
 In September 1981 , Livingstone began production of weekly newspaper , the Labour Herald , co @-@ edited with Ted Knight and Matthew Warburton . It was published by a press owned by the Trotskyist Workers Revolutionary Party ( WRP ) , who had financed it with funding from Libya and Iraq . Livingstone 's commercial relationship with WRP leader Gerry Healy was controversial among British socialists , many of whom disapproved of Healy 's violent nature . The Labour Herald folded in 1985 , when Healy was exposed as a sex offender and ousted from the WRP 's leadership . 
 A supporter of Irish reunification , Livingstone had connections with the left @-@ wing Irish republican party Sinn Féin and in July , met with the mother of an imprisoned Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) militant Thomas McElwee , then taking part in the 1981 Irish hunger strike . That day , Livingstone publicly proclaimed his support for those prisoners on hunger strike , claiming that the British government 's fight against the IRA was not " some sort of campaign against terrorism " but was " the last colonial war . " He was heavily criticised for this meeting and his statements in the mainstream press , while Prime Minister Thatcher claimed that his comments constituted " the most disgraceful statement I have ever heard . " Soon after , he also met with the children of Yvonne Dunlop , an Irish Protestant who had been killed in McElwee 's bomb attack . 
 On 10 October , the IRA bombed London 's Chelsea Barracks , killing 2 and injuring 40 . Denouncing the attack , Livingstone informed members of the Cambridge University Tory Reform Group that it was a misunderstanding to view the IRA as " criminals or lunatics " because of their strong political motives and that " violence will recur again and again as long as we are in Ireland . " Mainstream press criticised him for these comments , with The Sun labeling him " the most odious man in Britain " . In response , Livingstone proclaimed that the press coverage had been " ill @-@ founded , utterly out of context and distorted " , reiterating his opposition both to IRA attacks and British rule in Northern Ireland . Anti @-@ Livingstone pressure mounted and on 15 October he was publicly attacked in the street by members of unionist militia , The Friends of Ulster . In a second incident , Livingstone was attacked by far right skinheads shouting " <unk> bastard " at the Three Horseshoes Pub in Hampstead . Known as " Green Ken " among Ulster Unionists , Unionist paramilitary Michael Stone of the Ulster Defence Association plotted to kill Livingstone , only abandoning the plan when he became convinced that the security services were onto him . 
 Livingstone agreed to meet Gerry Adams , Sinn Féin President and IRA @-@ supporter , after Adams was invited to London by Labour members of the Troops Out campaign in December 1982 . The same day as the invitation was made , the Irish National Liberation Army ( INLA ) bombed The <unk> Well bar in Ballykelly , County Londonderry , killing 11 soldiers and 6 civilians ; in the aftermath , Livingstone was pressured to cancel the meeting . Expressing his horror at the bombing , Livingstone insisted that the meeting proceed , for Adams had no connection with the INLA , but Conservative Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw banned Adams ' entry to Britain with the 1976 Prevention of Terrorism ( Temporary Provisions ) Act . In February 1983 , Livingstone visited Adams in his constituency of West Belfast , receiving a hero 's welcome from local republicans . In July 1983 , Adams finally came to London on the invite of Livingstone and MP Jeremy Corbyn , allowing him to present his views to a mainstream British audience through televised interviews . In August , Livingstone was interviewed on Irish state radio , proclaiming that Britain 's 800 @-@ year occupation of Ireland was more destructive than the Holocaust ; he was publicly criticised by Labour members and the press . He also controversially expressed solidarity with the Marxist – Leninist government of Fidel Castro in Cuba against the U.S. economic embargo , in turn receiving an annual Christmas gift of Cuban rum from the Cuban embassy . 
 Courting further controversy , in the Falklands War of 1982 , during which the United Kingdom battled Argentina for control of the Falkland Islands , Livingstone stated his belief that the islands rightfully belonged to the Argentinian people , but not the military junta then ruling the country . Upon British victory , he sarcastically remarked that " Britain had finally been able to beat the hell out of a country smaller , weaker and even worse governed than we were . " Challenging the Conservative government 's militarism , the GLC proclaimed 1983 to be " Peace Year " , solidifying ties with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ( CND ) in order to advocate international nuclear disarmament , a measure opposed by the Thatcher government . In keeping with this pacifistic outlook , they banned the Territorial Army from marching past County Hall that year . The GLC then proclaimed 1984 to be " Anti @-@ Racism Year " . In July 1985 , the GLC twinned London with the Nicaraguan city of Managua , then under the control of the socialist Sandinista National Liberation Front . The press also continued to criticise the Livingstone administration 's funding of volunteer groups that they perceived represented only " fringe interests " . As Livingstone biographer Andrew Hosken remarked , " by far the most contentious grant " was given in February 1983 to a group called Babies Against the Bomb , founded by a group of mothers who had united to campaign against nuclear weapons . 
 Members of the London Labour groups chastised Livingstone for his controversial statements , believing them detrimental to the party , leading Labour members and supporters to defect to the Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) . Many highlighted Labour 's failure to secure the seat in the Croydon North West by @-@ election , 1981 as a sign of Labour 's prospects under Livingstone . Some called for Livingstone 's removal , but Michael Foot 's Trotskyist assistant Una Cooze defended Livingstone 's position to her boss . Television and radio outlets welcomed Livingstone on for interviews ; described by biographer John Carvel as having " one of the best television styles of any contemporary politician " , Livingstone used this medium to speak to a wider audience , gaining widespread public support , something <unk> attributed to his " directness , self @-@ deprecation , colourful language , complete <unk> under fire and lack of pomposity " , coupled with popular policies like Fares Fair . 
 = = = Abolition of the GLC : 1983 – 1986 = = = 
 The 1983 general election proved disastrous for Labour , as much of their support went to the Social Democrat @-@ Liberal Alliance , and Thatcher entered her second term in office . Foot was replaced by Neil Kinnock , a man Livingstone considered " repellent " . Livingstone publicly attributed Labour 's electoral failure to the leading role that the party 's capitalist wing had played , arguing that the party should promote a socialist program of " national reconstruction " , overseeing the nationalisation of banks and major industry and allowing for the investment in new development . 
 Considering it a waste of rate payer 's money , Thatcher 's government was keen to abolish the GLC and devolve control to the Greater London boroughs , stating its intention to do so in its 1983 electoral manifesto . Secretary of State for Employment Norman Tebbit lambasted the GLC as " Labour @-@ dominated , high @-@ spending and at odds with the government 's view of the world " ; Livingstone commented that there was " a huge gulf between the cultural values of the GLC Labour group and everything that Mrs Thatcher considered right and proper . " The government felt confident that there was sufficient opposition to Livingstone 's administration that they could abolish the GLC : according to a MORI poll in April 1983 , 58 % of Londoners were dissatisfied and 26 % satisfied with Livingstone . 
 Attempting to fight the proposals , the GLC devoted £ 11 million to a campaign led by Reg Race focusing on press campaigning , advertising , and parliamentary lobbying . The campaign sent Livingstone on a party roadshow conference in which he convinced the Liberal and Social Democratic parties to oppose abolition . Using the slogan " say no to no say " , they publicly highlighted that without the GLC , London would be the only capital city in Western Europe without a directly elected body . The campaign was successful , with polls indicating majority support among Londoners for retaining the Council , and in March 1984 , 20 @,@ 000 public servants held a 24 @-@ hour strike in support . The government nevertheless remained committed to abolition , and in June 1984 the House of Commons passed the Local Government Act 1985 with 237 votes in favour and 217 against . Livingstone and three senior GLC members resigned their seats in August 1984 , to force <unk> on the issue of abolition , but the Conservatives declined to contest them and all four were comfortably re @-@ elected on a low turnout . 
 The GLC was formally abolished at midnight on 31 March 1986 , with Livingstone marking the occasion by holding a free concert at Festival Hall . In his capacity as former leader of the GLC , Livingstone was invited to visit Australia , Israel , and Zimbabwe in the following months by leftist groups in those countries , before he and Allen undertook a 5 @-@ week Himalayan trek to the base camp of Mount Everest . 
 = = Member of Parliament = = 
 Livingstone defeated Reg Freeson to represent Labour for the north @-@ west London constituency of Brent East in the 1987 general election . When the election came , he narrowly defeated Conservative candidate Harriet Crawley to become Brent East 's MP , while Thatcher retained the Premiership for a third term . Livingstone found the atmosphere of the Houses of Parliament uncomfortable , labeling it " absolutely tribal " , and asserting that " It 's like working in the Natural History Museum , except not all the exhibits are stuffed . " There was much hostility between him and the Parliamentary Labour Party , who allocated him a windowless office with fellow leftist MP Harry Barnes . He took on Maureen Charleson as his personal secretary , who would remain with him for the next 20 years . 
 In his maiden speech to Parliament in July 1987 , Livingstone used parliamentary privilege to raise a number of allegations made by Fred Holroyd , a former Special Intelligence Service operative in Northern Ireland . Despite the convention of maiden speeches being non @-@ controversial , Livingstone alleged that Holroyd had been mistreated when he tried to expose MI5 collusion with Ulster loyalist paramilitaries in the 1970s . Thatcher denounced his claims as " utterly contemptible " . In September 1987 Livingstone was elected to Labour 's National Executive Committee ( NEC ) , although was voted off in October 1989 , to be replaced by John Prescott . As Kinnock tried to pull Labour to the centre , Livingstone worked to strengthen socialist elements in the party . He continued to make his opinions known , refusing to pay the controversial poll tax until it was revoked , and being one of the 55 Labour MPs to oppose British involvement in the Gulf War in January 1991 . Conversely , he supported NATO intervention in the Balkans , and the bombing of Serbia . 
 In the 1992 general election , John Major led the Conservatives to a narrow victory , resulting in Kinnock 's resignation as head of Labour . Livingstone put his name forward as a proposed replacement , with Bernie Grant as his deputy , although they were not selected , with John Smith and Margaret Beckett taking the positions instead . After Smith died in May 1994 , Livingstone again put his name down as a potential leader , although withdrew it due to a lack of support . Instead , Tony Blair was selected , with Livingstone predicting that he would be " the most right @-@ wing leader " in Labour history . Blair and his supporters sought to reform the party by further expunging leftist elements and taking it to the centre ground , thus creating " New Labour " , with Blairite Peter Mandelson asserting that hard left figures like Livingstone represented " the enemy " of reform . Throughout 1995 , Livingstone unsuccessfully fought Blair 's attempts to remove Clause Four ( promoting nationalised industry ) from the Labour constitution , which he saw as a betrayal of the party 's socialist roots . In 1996 , he warned of the growing influence of spin doctors in the party , and called for Blair to sack Alastair Campbell after a High Court judge criticised him in a libel trial . Nevertheless , Blair 's reforms led Labour to a landslide victory in the 1997 general election , resulting in the formation of the first Labour government since 1979 . In December 1997 , Livingstone joined a Labour revolt against Blair 's attempts to cut benefits to single mothers , and in March 1998 publicly criticised Gordon Brown for advocating " an awful lot of Thatcherite nonsense " and attempting to privatise the London Underground through the PPP scheme . However , in 1997 he was re @-@ elected to the NEC , beating Mandelson to the position . 
 Livingstone continued his association with members of Trotskyite group Socialist Action , with the group 's leader John Ross became his most important adviser , teaching him about economics . Investing in an advanced £ 25 @,@ 000 computer , he and Ross used the machine to undertake complex economic analysis , on the basis of which they began publishing the Socialist Economic Bulletin in 1990 . Two other members of the group , Redmond O 'Neill and Simon Fletcher , also became trusted advisers . When Socialist Action founded a campaign group , the Anti @-@ Racist Alliance , Livingstone came to be closely associated with it . They campaigned around the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence and the rise of the far right British National Party , but were disadvantaged by an ongoing rivalry with the Anti @-@ Nazi League . 
 As his political significance waned , Livingstone gained more work in the media , commenting that the press " started to use me only once they thought I was harmless " . To receive these outside earnings , he founded a company known as <unk> Ltd . In 1987 he authored an autobiography for HarperCollins , If Voting Changed Anything They 'd Abolish It , conducted journalism for the London Daily News , stood in for BBC Radio 2 disk @-@ jockey Jimmy Young , and served as a judge for that year 's Whitbread Prize . In 1989 , Unwin Hyman published his second book , Livingstone 's Labour : A Programme for the 90s , in which he expressed his views on a variety of issues , while that same year he was employed to promote Red Leicester cheese in adverts for the National Dairy Council and to appear in adverts for British Coal alongside Edwina Currie . In October 1991 Livingstone began writing a column for Rupert Murdoch 's right @-@ wing tabloid The Sun , a controversial move among British socialists . In his column he often discussed his love of amphibians and campaigned for the protection of the great crested newt , on the basis of which he was appointed vice president of the London Zoological Society in 1996 – 97 . He subsequently began to write a food column for Esquire and then The Evening Standard , also making regular appearances on the BBC quiz show Have I Got News For You ? . In 1995 , Livingstone was invited to appear on the track " <unk> Same " by the band Blur . 
 = = Mayor of London = = 
 = = = Mayoral election : 2000 = = = 
 By 1996 , various prominent public figures were arguing for the implementation of directly @-@ elected mayors for large UK cities like London . The idea of a London mayor of a Greater London Authority had been included in Labour 's 1997 election manifesto , and after their election a referendum was scheduled for May 1998 , in which there was a 72 % yes vote with a 34 % turnout . With the first mayoral election scheduled for May 2000 , in March 1998 Livingstone stated his intention to stand as a potential Labour candidate for the position . 
 Blair did not want Livingstone as London Mayor , claiming the latter was one of those who " almost knocked [ the party ] over the edge of the cliff into extinction " during the 1980s . He and the Labour spin doctors organised a campaign against Livingstone to ensure that he was not selected , with Campbell and Sally Morgan unsuccessfully attempting to get Oona King to denounce Livingstone . They failed to convince Mo Mowlam to stand for the mayorship , and instead encouraged the reluctant Frank Dobson to stand . Recognising that a ' one member , one vote ' election within the London Labour Party would probably see Livingstone selected over Dobson , Blair ensured that a third of the votes would come from the rank @-@ and @-@ file members , a third from the trade unions , and a third from Labour MPs and MEPs , the latter two of which he could pressure into voting for his own preferred candidate , something that Dobson was deeply uncomfortable with . Information on the Blairite campaign against Livingstone became public , costing Dobson much support ; nevertheless , due to the impact of the MPs and MEPs , Dobson won the candidacy with 51 % to Livingstone 's 48 % . 
 Livingstone proclaimed Dobson to be " a tainted candidate " and stated his intention to run for the Mayoralty as an independent candidate . Aware that this would result in his expulsion from Labour , he publicly stated that " I have been forced to choose between the party I love and upholding the democratic rights of Londoners . " The polls indicated clear support for Livingstone among the London electorate , with his campaign being run by his Socialist Action associates . He gained the support of a wide range of celebrities , from musicians like Fatboy Slim , Pink Floyd , the Chemical Brothers , and Blur , artists like Damian Hirst and Tracey Emin , and those from other fields , among them Ken Loach , Jo Brand , and Chris Evans , the latter of whom donated £ 200 @,@ 000 to the campaign ; half of what Livingstone required . In March 2000 , Livingstone agreed to make a public apology to the House of Commons , after he was criticised over his failure to properly register outside interests worth more than £ 150 @,@ 000 . The election took place in May 2000 , at which Livingstone came first with 58 % of first and second @-@ preference votes ; Conservative candidate Steven Norris came second and Dobson third . Livingstone started his acceptance speech with " As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted 14 years ago ... " 
 = = = First mayoral term : 2000 – 04 = = = 
 Livingstone now had " the largest and most direct mandate of any politician in British history " , receiving an annual salary of £ 87 @,@ 000 . It was the Mayor 's job to oversee a number of subordinate bodies , including the Metropolitan Police , Transport for London ( TfL ) , the London Development Agency , and the London Fire Brigade , and in doing so he was granted a number of executive powers . He would be scrutinised by the elected London Assembly , whose first chairman was Trevor Phillips , a Labour politician who had a reciprocated dislike of Livingstone . Livingstone was permitted twelve principal advisers , many of whom were members of Socialist Action or people whom he had worked with on the GLC . Ross and Fletcher became two of his closest confidants , with Livingstone commenting that " They aren 't just my closest political advisers ... they 're also mostly my best friends . " In 2002 , he promoted six of his senior aides , resulting in allegations of cronyism from Assembly members . The Mayoral office was initially based in temporary headquarters at Romney House in Marsham Street , Westminster , while a purpose @-@ built building was constructed in Southwark ; termed City Hall , it was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in July 2002 , with Livingstone commenting that it resembled a " glass testicle . " 
 Much of Livingstone 's first two years were devoted to setting up the Mayoral system and administration . He also devoted much time to battling New Labour 's plans to upgrade the London Underground system through a public – private partnership ( PPP ) program , believing it to be too expensive and tantamount to the privatisation of a state @-@ owned service . He furthermore had strong concerns about safety ; PPP would divide different parts of the Underground among various companies , something that he argued threatened a holistic safety and maintenance program . These concerns were shared by the National Union of Rail , Maritime and Transport Workers ( RMT ) and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen ( ASLEF ) trade union , who went on strike over the issue , being joined on the picket line by Livingstone . <unk> Bob Kiley as transport commissioner , the duo argued that the upgrade should be carried out in state hands through a public bond issue , as had been done in the case of the New York City Subway . They launched court cases against the government over PPP in 2001 – 02 , but were ultimately unsuccessful , and the project went ahead , with the Underground being privatised in January 2003 . 
 Although he had initially stated that he would not do so , Livingstone 's administration sought to phase out use of the Routemaster buses , the design for which dated to the 1950s . Although iconic , they were deemed hazardous and responsible for a high number of deaths and serious injuries as passengers climbed onto them , also being non @-@ wheelchair accessible and thus not meeting the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 . The process was gradual , with the last Routemaster being decommissioned in December 2005 . The Routemasters were replaced by a new fleet of 103 articulated buses , known colloquially as " <unk> buses " , which were launched in June 2002 . While the Routemasters fitted 80 people on at one time , the articulated buses fitted up to 140 passengers , however they were deemed dangerous for cyclists . Attempting to reduce London 's environmental impact , Livingstone created the London Hydrogen Partnership and the London Energy Partnership in his first term as Mayor of London . The Mayor 's Energy Strategy , " green light to clean power , " committed London to reducing its emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 % , relative to the 1990 level , by 2010 . 
 Livingstone sought to remove the pigeons from Trafalgar Square ; he tried to evict seed sellers and introduced hawks to scare the pigeons off . He pedestrianised the north side of the Square , transforming it into a public space with a cafe , public toilets , and a lift for the disabled . He introduced an annual Saint Patrick 's Day festival to celebrate the contributions of the Irish to London , and revived London 's free anti @-@ racism music festival , now called Rise : London United , later attributing London 's 35 % decrease in racist attacks to this and other anti @-@ racist policies . Continuing his support for LGBT rights , in 2001 he set up Britain 's first register for same @-@ sex couples ; while falling short of legal marriage rights , the register was seen as a step towards the Civil Partnership Act 2004 . 
 Livingstone 's relationship with Kate Allen ended in November 2001 , although they remained friends . He then started a relationship with Emma Beal , together having two children , Thomas ( born December 2002 ) and Mia ( born March 2004 ) . At a May 2002 party in Tufnell Park , Livingstone got into an argument with Beal 's friend Robin Hedges , a reporter for The Evening Standard . Beal subsequently fell off of a wall and bruised his ribs ; the press claimed that Livingstone had pushed him , although he insisted that he did not . Liberal Democrats on the London Assembly referred the matter to the Standards Board for England , who ruled that there was no evidence for any wrongdoing on Livingstone 's behalf . 
 As proposed in their election manifesto , in February 2003 Livingstone 's administration introduced a congestion charge covering 8 square miles in central London , charging motorists £ 5 a day for driving through the area . It was introduced in an attempt to deter traffic and reduce congestion ; Livingstone himself took the London Underground to work , and tried to inspire more Londoners to use public transport rather than cars . The policy was highly controversial , and strongly opposed by businesses , resident groups , the roads lobby , and the Labour government ; many commentators recognised that if opposition resulted in the policy being abandoned then it could lead to the end of Livingstone 's political career . That year , the Political Studies Association named Livingstone ' Politician of the Year ' due to his implementation of the ' bold and imaginative ' scheme . The scheme resulted in a marked reduction on traffic in central London , resulting in improved bus services , and by 2007 , TfL could claim that the charge had reduced congestion by 20 % . To further encourage the use of public transport , in June 2003 , the Oyster card system was introduced , while bus and Underground journeys were made free for people aged 11 to 18 . 
 In 2002 , Livingstone came out in support of a proposal for the 2012 Olympic Games to be held in London . He insisted however that the Games must be held in the East End , and result in an urban regeneration program centred on the Lee Valley . He gained the support of Labour 's culture secretary Tessa Jowell , who convinced the government to back the plans in May 2003 . In May 2004 , the International Olympic Commission put London on the shortlist of potential locations for the Games , alongside Paris , Madrid , Moscow , and New York City ; although Paris was widely expected to be the eventual victor , London would prove successful in its nomination . Another major development project was launched in February 2004 as the London Plan , in which Livingstone 's administration laid out their intentions to deal with the city 's major housing shortage by ensuring the construction of 30 @,@ 000 new homes a year . It stressed that 50 % of these should be deemed " affordable housing " although later critics would highlight that in actuality , the amount of " affordable housing " in these new constructions did not exceed 30 % . 
 Livingstone had no control over government policy regarding immigration , which had resulted in a significant growth in foreign arrivals coming to London during his administration ; from 2000 to 2005 London 's population grew by 200 @,@ 000 to reach 7 @.@ 5 million . He didn 't oppose this , encouraging racial equality and celebrating the city 's multiculturalism . Livingstone condemned the UK 's involvement in the Iraq War and involved himself in the Stop the War campaign . In November 2003 , he made headlines for referring to US President George W. Bush as " the greatest threat to life on this planet , " just before Bush 's official visit to the UK . Livingstone also organised an alternative " Peace Reception " at City Hall " for everybody who is not George Bush , " with anti @-@ war Vietnam veteran Ron <unk> as the guest of honour . 
 Livingstone 's success with the congestion charge and rejuvenation of Trafalgar Square led the Labour leadership to reconsider their position on him , with Blair re @-@ admitting him to the party and asking that he stand as their Mayoral candidate for the 2004 election . Livingstone eagerly agreed , and Labour Mayoral candidate Nicky Gavron volunteered to take a subordinate position as his deputy . In campaigning for the election , Livingstone highlighted his record : the congestion charge , free bus travel for under 11s , 1000 extra buses , and 5000 extra police officers , whereas his main competitor , the Conservative Steve Norris , campaigned primarily on a policy of abolishing the congestion charge . Livingstone continued to court controversy throughout the campaign ; in June 2004 he was quoted on The Guardian 's website as saying : " I just long for the day I wake up and find that the Saudi Royal Family are swinging from lamp @-@ posts and they 've got a proper government that represents the people of Saudi Arabia " , for which he was widely criticised . That same month he came under criticism from sectors of the left for urging RMT members to cross picket lines in a proposed Underground strike because the latest offer had been " extremely generous " , leading RMT general secretary Bob Crow to step down as a TfL board member . In the London mayoral election , 2004 , Livingstone was announced as the winner on 10 June 2004 . He won 36 % of first preference votes to Norris 's 28 % and Liberal Democrat Simon Hughes 's 15 % . When all the candidates except Livingstone and Norris were eliminated and the second preferences of those voters who had picked neither Livingstone or Norris as their first choice were counted , Livingstone won with 55 % to Norris 's 45 % . 
 = = = Second mayoral term : 2004 – 08 = = = 
 Amid the War on Terror and threat from Al Qaeda , Livingstone sought to build closer ties to the London 's Muslim community , controversially agreeing to meet with Islamist groups like the Muslim Association of Britain alongside moderate organisations . In July 2004 , he attended a conference discussing France 's ban on the burka at which he talked alongside Islamist cleric Yusuf al @-@ Qaradawi . Livingstone described al @-@ Qaradawi as " one of the most authoritative Muslim scholars in the world today " and argued that his influence could help stop the radicalisation of young British Muslims . The move was controversial , with Jewish and LGBT organisations criticising Livingstone , citing al @-@ Qaradawi 's record of anti @-@ Semitic and homophobic remarks , with the meeting leading to a publicised argument between Livingstone and his former supporter Peter Tatchell . Livingstone continued to champion the Palestinian cause in the Israel @-@ Palestine conflict , in March 2005 accusing Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of being a " war criminal " responsible for the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre . 
 During his second term , Livingstone continued his support for London 's bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games , playing a crucial role in securing vital Russian support for the bid . On 6 July 2005 , in a ceremony held in Singapore attended by Livingstone , London was announced as the victor , resulting in widespread celebration . The following day , British @-@ born Islamist suicide bombers undertook three attacks on the Underground and another on a bus , killing 52 civilians . Livingstone gave a speech from Singapore denouncing the attackers as terrorists , before immediately returning to London . Informing the BBC that Western foreign policy was largely to blame for the attacks , his response to the situation was widely praised , even by opponents . Fearing an Islamophobic backlash against the city 's Muslim minority , he initiated an advertising campaign to counter this , holding a rally for inter @-@ community unity in Trafalgar Square . A second , failed suicide bombing attack took place on 21 July , and in the aftermath police officers shot dead a Brazilian tourist , Jean Charles de Menezes , whom they mistook for a bomber . Police initially lied about the killing , resulting in widespread condemnation , although Livingstone defended the actions of Metropolitan Police commissioner Ian Blair . 
 After Livingstone left a party in February 2005 , Oliver Finegold , a reporter for the Evening Standard , attempted to ask Livingstone a question in the street . Aware that Finegold was Jewish , Livingstone accused him of acting " just like a concentration camp guard " and asserting that he worked for the " reactionary bigots ... who supported fascism " at the Daily Mail . Although the Evening Standard initially did not deem the comments newsworthy , they were leaked to The Guardian , resulting in accusations of anti @-@ Semitism against Livingstone from the Board of Deputies of British Jews . There were many calls for Livingstone to apologise , including from Tony Blair , the London Assembly , a Holocaust survivors group and his deputy Gavron ( the daughter of a Holocaust survivor ) , but Livingstone refused . The Standards Board for England asked the <unk> Panel for England to deal with Livingstone on the issue , who in February 2006 found him guilty of bringing his office into disrepute and suspended him from office for a month . The decision was controversial , with Livingstone and many others arguing that an unelected board should not have the power to suspend an elected official . In October 2006 at the High Court of Justice , Justice Collins overturned the decision to suspend Livingstone . 
 Although he had alienated much of London 's Jewish community , Livingstone denied charges of anti @-@ Semitism , holding regular meetings with the city 's Jewish groups and introducing public Hanukkah celebrations in Trafalgar Square in December 2005 . He came under further accusations of anti @-@ semitism in March 2006 for asserting that the businessmen David and Simon Reuben should return to Iran if they did not like Britain ; he claimed he had mistakenly believed them to be Iranian Muslims , whereas in reality they were Indian Jews . He refused to apologise to the Reubens , instead offering " a complete apology to the people of Iran for the suggestion that they may be linked in any way to the Reuben brothers " . 
 In March 2006 , Livingstone publicly criticised foreign embassies in London who refused to pay the congestion charge under the conditions of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations . His criticism focused on US diplomat Robert Tuttle , condemning him as a " chiselling little crook " whose embassy was refusing to pay the £ 1 @.@ 5 million he believed it owed . In February 2007 , Livingstone 's administration doubled the congestion charge zone by extending it westwards into Kensington and Chelsea , despite opposition from resident groups . In October 2007 , the government agreed to go ahead with Crossrail , a £ 16 billion project to construct a train line under central London , linking Berkshire to Essex . Meanwhile , Livingstone felt vindicated in his former opposition to public private partnership when one of the companies who now controlled part of the Underground , Metronet , collapsed in July 2007 , with the state having to intervene to protect the service . Livingstone had also welcomed the construction of skyscrapers in London , giving the go ahead for 15 to be constructed during his Mayoralty , including 30 St Mary Axe and The Shard . He considered it necessary to fill the demand for office space , but was criticised by groups and individuals , most notably Charles , Prince of Wales , concerned about the preservation of historic skylines . 
 In May 2006 , Livingstone welcomed Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez to London , hosting an event for him at City Hall . This was condemned by various Conservatives claiming that Chávez 's democratic socialist government had undermined pluralistic democracy . Livingstone proceeded to accept the presidency of the pro @-@ Chávez Venezuelan Information Centre . In November 2006 , Livingstone travelled to Latin America to visit Chávez , during which he and his entourage stayed in Cuba at a cost of £ 29 @,@ 000 ; many British sources condemned the visit as a waste of tax @-@ payer 's money . In August 2007 , it was announced that Livingstone had come to an agreement with oil @-@ rich Venezuela ; Chávez 's government would supply £ 16 million a year worth of free oil to TfL , who would use it to subsidise half priced bus fares for 250 @,@ 000 Londoners on benefits . In return , London would provide expertise in running transport , as well as other services such as CCTV and waste management . 
 Livingstone helped organise the first " Eid in the Square " event at Trafalgar Square in commemoration of the Islamic Eid ul @-@ Fitr festival in October 2006 . In May 2007 , Livingstone travelled to New York City to attend the <unk> conference of major world cities to deal with environmentalist issues . One of the leading figures of the conference , he called for other cities to adopt congestion charging as an environmental measure . In August 2007 , he issued a public apology on behalf of London for its role in the transatlantic slave trade . He selected the anniversary of the Haitian Revolution on which to do it , and in his tearful speech asserted that it was the resistance of enslaved persons rather than the philanthropy of wealthy whites that led to the trade 's end . 
 A week later he attended the unveiling of the statue of Nelson Mandela in Parliament Square , where he met with Nelson Mandela . In June 2007 , he criticised the planned £ 200 million Thames Water Desalination Plant at Beckton , which will be the United Kingdom 's first , calling it " misguided and a retrograde step in UK environmental policy " , and that " we should be encouraging people to use less water , not more . " In October 2007 , London Councils stated Livingstone had gone back on his promise to chair the developing London Waste and Recycling Board , and to provide £ 6 million of funding for the project , because " the government had failed to provide him with absolute control of the Board . " 
 Livingstone intended to stand again as Labour candidate in the London Mayoral election , 2008 , this time against Conservative candidate Boris Johnson . At the start of the campaign Livingstone took Johnson more seriously than many others were doing , referring to him as " the most formidable opponent I will face in my political career . " Much of Labour 's campaign revolved around criticising Johnson for perceived racist and homophobic comments that he had made in the past , although Johnson strenuously denied that he was bigoted . Livingstone also proposed that if he were to win a third term he would increase the congestion charge fee to £ 25 for the most polluting vehicles , while removing it for the least , and that he would also introduce a cycling scheme based on the <unk> ' system in Paris . As part of his campaign , Livingstone highlighted that by 2008 , the Metropolitan Police had 35 @,@ 000 officers , 10 @,@ 000 more than it had had in 2000 , also highlighting statistics to indicate falling crime rates across the city during his Mayorship . Nevertheless , there had been a recent rise in gang killing among young people , with 27 teenagers having been killed in gang warfare during 2007 , a statistic used by Johnson 's campaign who emphasised the idea that a Johnson administration would be far tougher on youth crime and anti @-@ social behaviour . 
 Further controversy rocked Livingstone 's campaign in December 2007 when Evening Standard journalist Andrew Gilligan alleged that one of Livingstone 's close advisers , Lee Jasper , had siphoned off at least £ 2 @.@ 5 million from the London Development Agency to fund black community groups with which he was closely associated . Livingstone stood by Jasper and claimed that the Evening Standard campaign was racist , but ultimately agreed to suspend Jasper while a full investigation took place . An independent report into the affair by District auditor Michael Haworth @-@ Maden in July 2009 found no evidence of " misappropriation of funds " but noted " significant " gaps in financial paperwork . The election took place in May 2008 , and witnessed a turnout of approximately 45 % of eligible voters , with Johnson receiving 43 @.@ 2 % and Livingstone 37 % of first @-@ preference votes ; when second @-@ preference votes were added , Johnson proved victorious with 53 @.@ 2 % to Livingstone 's 46 @.@ 8 % .

 Newly elected , Mayor Johnson paid tribute to Livingstone and his " very considerable achievements " , hoping that the new administration could " discover a way in which the mayoralty can continue to benefit from your transparent love of London " . Johnson 's administration nevertheless reversed a number of Livingstone 's policies , for instance overturning the deal for Venezuelan oil . Intent on giving Venezuela the " advice that we promised " , in August 2008 Livingstone announced that he would be advising urban planning in Caracas . Livingstone predicted that in twenty years it could become a " first @-@ world city " , and hoped to help with his " very extensive network of contacts both domestically and internationally " . 
 In January 2009 , Livingstone responded to the Gaza War by calling for the European Union and the UK to bring home their ambassadors to Israel to express disapproval for the " slaughter and systematic murder of innocent Arabs " . From September 2009 to March 2011 , Livingstone presented the book review programme Epilogue for the Iranian state @-@ sponsored international news channel Press TV , for which he came under criticism from Iranian exile groups . In July 2010 , he spoke at the Durham Miners ' Gala , praising working class culture . He also used the speech to attack spending cuts by the new coalition government , claiming they were not necessary . 
 In September 2010 , Livingstone criticised public spending cuts announced by the recently elected Conservative @-@ Liberal Democrat coalition government , which he stated amounted to £ 45 billion a year for London alone , and were " beyond Margaret Thatcher 's wildest dreams " as well as threatening to result in widespread division and poverty across the capital . In May 2011 , Livingstone said he was " appalled " that Osama bin Laden had been shot dead by US Special forces " in his pyjamas " and " in front of his kid , " and that the values of a western democracy would have been best demonstrated if Bin Laden had been put on trial and his words challenged . 
 Livingstone stood for the Labour candidacy as 2012 Mayoral candidate . His campaign attracted criticism when he joked that the election was " a simple choice between good and evil " , and when he was accused of anti @-@ semitism by Jewish Labour supporters for suggesting that being largely wealthy , the Jewish community would not vote for him . He denied making the comments , but nevertheless apologised . 
 Johnson 's campaign emphasised the accusation that Livingstone was guilty of tax evasion , for which Livingstone called Johnson a " bare @-@ faced liar " . The political scientist Andrew <unk> believed that Livingstone 's campaign suffered from its focus on criticising Johnson rather than presenting an alternate and progressive vision of London 's future , also suggesting that after decades in the public eye , Livingstone had come to be seen as an over @-@ familiar and politically tired figure by the London electorate . On 4 May 2012 Livingstone was defeated in the London 2012 Mayoral Elections by the incumbent Mayor , Boris Johnson . There was only a difference of 62 @,@ 538 votes between the 2 candidates with Livingstone receiving 992 @,@ 273 votes and Johnson receiving 1 @,@ 054 @,@ 811 votes . Livingstone criticised bias in the media and declared that he would be bowing out of politics . 
 He remained publicly critical of Johnson over the coming years ; in April 2014 , he admitted that while he had once feared Johnson as " the most hardline right @-@ wing ideologue since Thatcher " , over the course of Johnson 's mayoralty , he had instead concluded that he was " a fairly lazy <unk> who just wants to be there " but who does very little work . 
 = = = Under Corbyn 's leadership : 2015 – = = = 
 In May 2015 , Livingstone endorsed Sadiq Khan to be the Labour candidate for the 2016 London mayoral election , and in July then endorsed Jeremy Corbyn in the 2015 Labour Party leadership election . After Corbyn was elected Labour leader , Livingstone was one of his most prominent allies ; in November 2015 Corbyn appointed Livingstone to co @-@ convene Labour 's defence review alongside Maria Eagle . This appointment was criticised by shadow defence minister Kevan Jones , who expressed the view that Livingstone knew little about defence and that it would damage the party 's reputation . Livingstone responded by claiming that Jones – who has spoken about his own clinical depression – needed " psychiatric help " . Jones took offense , and while Livingstone initially refused to apologise , he subsequently did so at Corbyn 's urging . 
 Livingstone faced further criticism following a television appearance in which he stated that the perpetrators of the 2005 London bombings carried out their actions as retribution for UK involvement in the Iraq War . In March 2016 , Livingstone again courted controversy by comparing a hedge fund 's donation to Labour MP Dan Jarvis to " Jimmy Savile funding a children 's group " ; it subsequently emerged that Livingstone himself had received £ 8 @,@ 000 from a hedge fund , leading to accusations of hypocrisy . 
 = = = = Suspension from the Labour Party = = = = 
 In April 2016 , Livingstone commented publicly on the suspension of Labour MP Naz Shah ; she had been removed from the party after it was revealed that she had made comments on Facebook suggesting that Israeli Jews should be relocated to the United States . Livingstone stated that Shah 's postings , which were made before she became an MP at the 2015 general election , were " completely over the top " and " rude " , although he did not deem them antisemitic . He asserted that there is a " well @-@ orchestrated campaign by the Israel lobby to smear anybody who criticises Israeli policy as antisemitic " , and also stated that Adolf Hitler " was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews " . 
 He defended his claims by reference to Lenni Brenner 's Zionism in the Age of the Dictators , and many commentators suggested that Livingstone was referring to the Haavara Agreement between Nazi Germany and the Zionist Federation of Germany . Livingstone 's statements were criticised by historians , among them Roger Moorhouse , who said that they were historically inaccurate . He also became involved in a public argument on the subject with the Labour MP John Mann . 
 Livingstone was subsequently suspended from Labour Party membership " for bringing the party into disrepute " . Over 20 Labour MPs called for Livingstone 's suspension , while Jon <unk> , founder of the pro @-@ Corbyn Momentum group , called for Livingstone to leave politics altogether , and Khan called for his expulsion from the party . In a subsequent interview , Livingstone expressed regret both for mentioning Hitler and for offending Jews but added that " I 'm not going to apologise for telling the truth . " Corbyn announced that the decision to expel Livingstone would be made by a National Executive Committee internal inquiry , whilst Livingstone insisted that he would be exonerated on the basis of Brenner 's book , saying " how can the truth be an offence ? " Following this controversy , Livingstone has questioned whether or not he has Jewish ancestry on his mother 's side stating that Greville <unk> used to speculate whether or not he was Jewish because " my grandmother ’ s name was Zona . " 
 Livingstone was sacked in Spring 2016 by LBC . He was quoted by The Daily Telegraph as saying this was because of his comments about Hitler . With the former Conservative minister David Mellor , Livingstone had co @-@ hosted a Saturday morning current affairs programme on LBC for 8 years . 
 = = Political views = = 
 Within the Labour Party , Livingstone was aligned with the hard left . Historian Alwyn W. Turner noted that Livingstone 's entire approach to politics revolved not simply around providing public services , but in trying to change society itself ; in his words , he wanted to get away from the concept of " old white men coming along to general management committees and talking about rubbish collection . " Biographer John Carvel , a journalist from The Guardian , remarked that Livingstone 's political motivation was a " fundamental desire ... for a more <unk> , cooperative society " , leading him to oppose " concentrations of power and ... exploitation in all its forms – economic , racial and sexual . " However , Livingstone has also described his approach to fiscal policy as " monetarist " : " I was a monetarist right from the beginning when I was leader of the GLC . We paid down debt every year . We had an absolutely firm rule . " 
 Livingstone describes himself as a socialist . In 1987 , he stated that " politics is my religion . It 's my moral framework . I believe a socialist society is inherently the best thing , and that 's like an act of faith . " In 2007 , he stated that " I still believe one day that the idea that the main means of production are owned by private individuals ... will be considered as anti @-@ democratic as the idea serfs could be tied to the land . But I will not be alive when that day comes . " Livingstone had always worked towards a unified socialist front on the British left , and disliked the tendency towards splintering and forming rival factions , usually over issues of political theory , among the socialist community . Although rejecting Marxism , throughout his political career he has worked alongside Marxist far @-@ left groups and has become involved with the " politics of the street " . He has not worked with those Marxist groups , such as the Socialist Workers Party and the Revolutionary Communist Party , who advocate the destruction of the Labour Party as the way forward for socialism , seeing their beliefs as incompatible with his own . Livingstone has consistently opposed the actions of the Israeli government . In a 2005 interview he said that he was not against the existence of Israel , but rather Ariel Sharon 's government ; he recalled that on his 1986 visit to the country he got on well with its left @-@ wing politicians . 
 Livingstone has consistently rejected being defined under any particular ideological current of socialism . Recognising this , in 2000 , the former Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock asserted that Livingstone could only be defined as a " <unk> " . Livingstone 's understanding of politics arises from his studies of animal behaviour and anthropology ; rejecting the idea that the human species is naturally progressing ( a view advocated by socialists like the Fabian Society ) , Livingstone instead took the view that human society is still coming to terms with the massive socio @-@ economic changes that it experienced upon the development of agriculture during the Neolithic . Highlighting that a hunter @-@ gatherer mode of subsistence is more natural to the human species , he believes that modern society has to adopt many hunter @-@ gatherer values – namely mutual co @-@ operation and emphasis on human relationships rather than consumerism – in order to survive . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Historian Alwyn W. Turner noted that Livingstone was a " gifted communicator and self @-@ publicist " who was able to stump his opponents using his " mischievous sense of humour " . Biographer John Carvel echoed these comments , highlighting that Livingstone had a " talent for public speaking " . Biographer Andrew Hosken noted that many of those who had worked with Livingstone had commented on him being an excellent boss , who was " a good <unk> , decisive and supportive " as well as being " a friendly and modest colleague . " Jenny McCartney , a reporter from The Spectator , expressed the view that " in person he is hard to dislike . There 's a notable absence of pomposity in his manner , a propensity to laughter , and his love of an ideological scrap is allied to a calm , sometimes wry style of delivery : it looks fiercer on paper . " In The Guardian , the journalist Hugh Muir described Livingstone as a man who is " happiest in the limelight , discomforted by the periphery " and who also " hates to apologise ... especially when called upon [ to do so ] ... by media or political opponents for whom he has no respect " . 
 On the issue of nationality , Livingstone has expressed the view that he identifies as English rather than British , although his father was Scottish and he supports the continued existence of the United Kingdom . Although raised into a nominally Christian family , Livingstone renounced religious belief when he was eleven , becoming an atheist . In a 2005 interview he commented that in doing so he had rejected " mumbo @-@ jumbo in favour of rational science . " He is known for his enthusiasm for gardening and keeping and breeding newts . He was the first person to breed the Western Dwarf Clawed Frog Hymenochirus <unk> in captivity . Livingstone is a big fan of The Godfather film franchise , stating that the actions of the criminal organisations within the movies are very much akin to the world of politics . 
 = = = Family = = = 
 Livingstone repeatedly attempted to keep his family life private , commenting that " I expect that my private life is not in the public domain and I 'm rude to any journalist who turns up ... at home " . It is known that he has five children . Livingstone married Christine Pamela Chapman in 1973 ; the marriage ended in divorce in 1982 . Around that time he became involved with Kate Allen , now director of Amnesty International in the UK ; the couple separated in November 2001 . He then entered a relationship with his office manager , Emma Beal ; they have a son and a daughter together . Livingstone and Beal married on 26 September 2009 in the Mappin Pavilion of London Zoo . They live in North London . 
 Livingstone had also fathered three children prior to 2000 ; a boy by one mother and two girls by another . The children were born to two different women while Livingstone was involved with Kate Allen , according to an article by Decca <unk> : 
 In his memoir , he describes how one was an old friend who was keen to have children but feared she was running out of time . " We had never been involved romantically but I knew her well enough to know she would be a wonderful mother and so I said I would like to be the father of her children . " A daughter was born in 1990 , and another in 1992 . Then another friend said she 'd like to have children : " And we agreed to have a baby . " Their son was born within weeks of his daughter in 1992 . 
 = = Legacy and influence = = 
 Throughout his career , Livingstone has polarised public opinion , and was widely recognised as a risk @-@ taker . Supporters described him as the " People 's Ken " and an " anti @-@ politician politician " , opining that he had the common touch with working @-@ class Londoners that most British politicians lacked . He was widely recognised for having improved the status of minority groups in London . He was also deemed a " formidable operator " at City Hall , with an " intimate knowledge " of London . He was also criticised during his career . During his Mayorship , he faced repeated accusations of cronyism for favouring his chosen aides over other staff . One of his supporters , Atma Singh , commented that under Livingstone 's leadership , a culture of bullying pervaded at City Hall , although this was denied by many other staff there .

 During the 1980s , Spitting Image featured a fictionalised version of Livingstone voiced by Harry Enfield . In 1990 , BBC show The Comic Strip produced an episode entitled " GLC : The Carnage Continues ...

 = U.S. Route 13 Business ( Wilmington , Delaware ) = 
 U.S. Route 13 Business ( US 13 Bus . ) is an 8 @.@ 19 @-@ mile ( 13 @.@ 18 km ) business route of US 13 that runs through the heart of Wilmington in New Castle County , Delaware , where US 13 bypasses downtown Wilmington to the east , running near Interstate 495 ( I @-@ 495 ) and the Delaware River . US 13 Bus. begins at US 13 at the southern border of Wilmington and heads north toward the downtown area , where it splits into a one @-@ way pair . Past downtown , the business route heads through the northeastern part of the city on North Market Street before continuing through suburban Brandywine Hundred on Philadelphia Pike . US 13 Bus. reaches its northern terminus at US 13 in Claymont . US 13 Bus. is a four @-@ lane road for much of its length . 
 The Philadelphia Pike was built in the 1820s and improved to a state highway by 1920 . US 13 was designated to run through downtown Wilmington and along Philadelphia Pike in 1926 . During the 1930s , US 13 was shifted from Market Street to a one @-@ way pair on Market and French streets before both directions were moved onto French Street through downtown Wilmington . In the 1950s , the route was shifted to Walnut and French streets in the downtown area . The Walnut Street extension south of downtown , which included a new bridge over the Christina River , opened in 1957 . US 13 Bus. was designated in 1970 when US 13 was routed to bypass Wilmington along the former US 13 Alternate ( US 13 Alt . ) The business route was moved to its current one @-@ way pairing on Walnut and King street in the 1970s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 US 13 Bus. branches off of US 13 at the southern edge of Wilmington , just north of I @-@ 495 . From here , the business route heads north on four @-@ lane divided South Walnut Street . Immediately after beginning , the route has a southbound ramp to southbound I @-@ 495 and intersects Rogers Road . US 13 Bus. heads through commercial areas , becoming undivided as it comes to a bridge over Norfolk Southern 's Shellpot Branch railroad line . The route splits into a one @-@ way pair , with the northbound direction following South Walnut Street and the southbound direction following South Market Street , with three northbound lanes and four southbound lanes . The road passes businesses and a few homes and a high @-@ rise apartment complex before the business route crosses the Christina River on the Walnut Street Bridge northbound and the South Market Street Bridge southbound , both of which are drawbridges . 
 US 13 Bus. heads into downtown Wilmington and crosses under Amtrak 's Northeast Corridor railroad line at the Wilmington Station that serves Amtrak and SEPTA 's Wilmington / Newark Line . Immediately after , the business route intersects the eastern terminus of DE 48 , which follows Front Street eastbound and 2nd Street westbound . At this point , US 13 Bus. continues north to follow North Walnut Street northbound and North King Street southbound , with four northbound lanes and three southbound lanes . The road passes downtown businesses and intersects DE 9 ( 4th Street ) near the New Castle County Court House . Continuing through the downtown , the business route carries three lanes in each direction and continues near high @-@ rise buildings , with the southbound direction passing to the east of the Delaware College of Art and Design north of 6th Street . Further north , the route comes to a junction with the southern terminus of DE 52 , which follows 11th Street eastbound and 12th Street westbound , near Rodney Square . At the north end of downtown , northbound US 13 Bus. turns west on 16th Street to rejoin the southbound direction . 
 From here , US 13 Bus. heads north of four @-@ lane undivided North Market Street and crosses the Brandywine Creek . After the bridge , the road curves northeast and becomes a three @-@ lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes , passing urban residential and commercial development as it comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of DE 202 ( Concord Avenue ) . The route becomes a two @-@ lane road and passes more urban areas along with a couple cemeteries . 
 US 13 Bus. widens to four lanes again as it heads out of Wilmington and heads into suburban Brandywine Hundred , with the name of the road changing to Philadelphia Pike . Here , the business route intersects DE 3 near Bellefonte and forms a concurrency with that route . The two routes pass suburban homes and businesses , crossing Marsh Road before DE 3 splits from US 13 Bus. by heading to the northwest . US 13 Bus. passes to the southeast of Bellevue State Park and continues northeast through residential neighborhoods with scattered businesses , heading through Holly Oak before it reaches Claymont . At Harvey Road , the road narrows to two travel lanes and a center turn lane until the business route intersects US 13 and reaches its northern terminus , with Philadelphia Pike continuing northeast as part of US 13 . 
 The portion of the route between A Street and DE 9 ( 4th Street ) in Wilmington is part of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway , a Delaware Byway . US 13 Bus. has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 30 @,@ 948 vehicles at A Street in Wilmington to a low of 8 @,@ 384 vehicles at the DE 3 intersection near Bellefonte . US 13 Bus. is a part of the National Highway System between the southern terminus and DE 202 in Wilmington . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1813 , the Wilmington and Philadelphia Turnpike Company was chartered to build a turnpike running from the Brandywine Bridge in Wilmington northeast to the Pennsylvania border , where the roadway would continue to Philadelphia . A 3 @.@ 75 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 04 km ) long portion of the road near Wilmington was finished in 1816 with the remainder completed in 1823 . With the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 , the Philadelphia Pike was to be improved by the state . The Philadelphia Pike was upgraded to a state highway by 1920 . 
 In 1925 , recommendations were made to improve the South Market Street Causeway over the Christina River in Wilmington , which included a new bridge over the river . Construction on the drawbridge began in May 1926 . In 1927 , the new drawbridge , the four @-@ lane South Market Street Bridge , opened over the Christina River on South Market Street in Wilmington , replacing a previous drawbridge that was only two lanes wide . 
 With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926 , US 13 was routed to head through Wilmington along Market Street and to the northeast of Wilmington along Philadelphia Pike . In 1926 , the Delaware State Highway Department suggested the Philadelphia Pike be widened . US 13 was widened along the Philadelphia Pike between Shellpot Park and Bellevue Quarry in 1927 . In 1928 , the widening of Philadelphia Pike was completed . 
 By 1932 , US 13 was split into the one @-@ way pair of French Street northbound and Market Street southbound in the downtown area . Both directions of the route was shifted to use French Street by 1936 . On July 18 , 1938 , the grade crossing with the Reading Railroad ( now abandoned ) and the Pennsylvania Railroad ( now Norfolk Southern 's Shellpot Branch ) on South Market Street in Wilmington was eliminated with the opening of a bridge over the railroad tracks . 
 In 1952 , a new bridge over the Christina River , the Walnut Street Bridge , was proposed to link Walnut Street in the downtown area with the Dupont Parkway section of US 13 south of the city . Under this plan , the Walnut Street Bridge would be used for northbound traffic while the South Market Street Bridge would be used for southbound traffic . By this time , US 13 was routed on a one @-@ way pair in the downtown area , using Walnut Street northbound and French Street southbound . A year later , the Walnut Street Bridge project was under contract . Construction on the project began in 1955 . Construction of the Walnut Street Extension , which included the drawbridge , approach roads , and a new bridge under the Pennsylvania Railroad ( now Amtrak 's Northeast Corridor ) , was completed in 1957 . As a result , US 13 was split into the one @-@ way pair of South Walnut Street northbound and South Market Street southbound between the south end of the city and downtown . 
 Plans were made to widen the Philadelphia Pike to a four @-@ lane road between Bellevue Road and Claymont in 1954 . The widening project was completed in 1956 . US 13 Bus. was established in 1970 , replacing the former alignment of US 13 through Wilmington that was shifted to bypass the city along the former US 13 Alt . By 1976 , southbound US 13 Bus. was shifted to use King Street instead of French Street through downtown Wilmington .

 = Most Wanted ( Hilary Duff album ) = 
 Most Wanted is the first compilation album of American singer Hilary Duff . It was released on August 10 , 2005 , by Hollywood Records . The album comprises ten previously released tracks ( three of which are in a remixed form ) , and three new recordings : " Wake Up " , " Beat of My Heart " , and " Break My Heart " . A deluxe edition of the album , subtitled The Collector 's Signature Edition , was also released , containing additional remixes and another new recording " Supergirl " . At first , Duff was concerned about the reaction of fans to the new songs , since they carry a " totally different sound " and are more dance @-@ oriented than her previous music . 
 Following its release , Most Wanted received mostly negative reviews from critics , who deemed the release as premature , stating that Duff did not have enough material to warrant a compilation . However , the Dead Executives @-@ produced tracks received favorable comments ; critics wrote that they stood out from the rest of the album . In the United States , the album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart , becoming Duff 's second number one album there . It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . Elsewhere , it debuted at number one in Canada , and reached the top ten in Australia , Ireland , Italy , Japan and New Zealand . 
 Four singles were released from the album . The lead single , " Wake Up " , was released in August 2005 , and peaked within the top ten in countries including Italy , Norway and the United Kingdom . In the United States , the song reached number 29 and was certified Gold by the RIAA . The accompanying music video features Duff portraying styles from cities over the world like London and Tokyo . The second single , " Beat of My Heart " , peaked in the top 20 in countries such as Australia , Italy and Spain . " Supergirl " was released in February 2006 exclusively to the iTunes Store as the album 's third single and " Fly " , originally released as the lead single from Hilary Duff , was released throughout Europe as the fourth and final single from Most Wanted . Duff embarked on the worldwide Still Most Wanted Tour in support of the album ; the tour ran from July 2005 through September 2006 . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 Following Hollywood 's reported disappointment in the lack of sales longevity of the Hilary Duff album and the chart performance of " Fly " , all further single releases from Hilary Duff in the United States were cancelled and the Most Wanted project was quickly conceived . On May 20 , 2005 , MTV News reported that Duff would be releasing a new album in August , comprising previously released tracks and four new recordings . It was also announced that preceding the album 's release , Duff would begin a 32 @-@ date summer concert tour in support of the album . Four days later , on May 24 , the album 's title was revealed to be Most Wanted , and the album 's release date was announced to be August 16 , 2005 . The following month , in an interview with MTV News , Duff said that she had been working with brothers Joel and Benji Madden , of the American rock band Good Charlotte , and Jason Epperson ( together known under the production name the Dead Executives ) to write and produce new songs for the compilation . She said that " ... they 're three of my favorite songs I 've ever done . ... It was really fun being in the studio with them . " Described by Duff as the first time when " all the responsibility was on [ her ] " , she went into the recording studio without the guidance of her record label or management . According to Duff , she did not tell anyone at her record label that she was working with the Dead Executives . Joel , whom Duff had been dating at the time , was aware that she needed new material for a compilation album , and knew that she wanted a " totally different sound " . Together , the Dead Executives went into the recording studio and worked on new music for Duff , before bringing her into the studio to collectively work on them . 
 Duff described working with them as pleasant , and the music as a new milestone in her career , stating that working with " people you 're close with makes a world of difference when you 're recording and being creative . " At the same time , Duff was also nervous about how her fans would react to the new music . Duff recorded four tracks for the album , three of which appear on the standard edition of the album — " Wake Up " , " Beat of My Heart " and " Break My Heart " — while the fourth appears only on the deluxe edition : " Supergirl " . The song was penned by Duff alongside Kara DioGuardi and Greg Wells . The track listing for Most Wanted was revealed on July 12 , 2005 , and the album was released on August 16 , 2005 in the United States and Canada . The Japanese standard edition of the album features the same track listing as The Collector 's Signature Edition , with additional remixes of " Wake Up " by DJ Kaya , and was released on August 10 , 2005 . Another version with a bonus DVD including music videos to selected songs and " making of " clips was also released in the same region . In the US , the iTunes digital version includes an interview with Duff . A deluxe edition of the album , subtitled The Collector 's Signature Edition , was also released , containing an acoustic version of " Who 's That Girl ? " , an alternate version of " Jericho " and a remix of " Party Up " along with " Supergirl " . The pressing features a different album art and was packed with four autographed photo cards and a wristband . Most Wanted also contains 10 previously released tracks from Metamorphosis ( 2003 ) and Hilary Duff ( 2004 ) , as well as songs from soundtracks of Duff 's films : The Lizzie McGuire Movie ( 2003 ) and A Cinderella Story ( 2004 ) , three of which — " Come Clean " , " Rock This World " and " Why Not " — are in a remixed form . 
 = = New material = = 
 " Wake Up " , the opening track , is a mid @-@ tempo number backed by dance , pop and electronic beats , and has " a more mature pop @-@ techno sound " than Duff 's previous work . Its instrumentation includes a guitar , bass and drums . Kelefa <unk> of The New York Times noted that the song contains musical influences of The Go @-@ Go 's . The lyrics of the song speak about having fun . Duff initially sings about the consequences of her fame and how people think they know " everything about [ me ] " ( " There 's people talking / They talk about me / They know my name / They think they know everything / But they don 't know anything about me " ) . As the chorus draws near , the song takes on a " party anthem " approach , where Duff discusses the " struggle " for joy and self @-@ confidence : " I know I make mistakes / I 'm living life day to day / It 's never really easy but it 's OK ... " According to Duff , the song " makes you want to forget about all the pressure of dealing with your boss , or your teacher , or your mom , or [ whoever ] , " and lyrically discusses " getting out and not forgetting to have some fun . " Duff has also said the song also " talks about being in all [ my ] favorite places in the world , which is Tokyo and Paris and London and New York . " " Beat of My Heart " , the third track on the album , is inspired by the new wave genre . The song also draws influences from the bubblegum pop and dance genres . It carries a " soft electronic pop " sound and has the heart beat sound as its base . According to Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine , the word ' beat of my heart ' is repeated forty @-@ four times in the song . 
 The next new track and the ninth track on the album , " Break My Heart " is another dance @-@ inspired number incorporating pop punk elements , and was described as a " highly produced four @-@ on @-@ the @-@ floor rocker . " The song interpolates " slick and clean ' punk ' guitars and a chugging rhythm " . " Break My Heart " leans more towards the rock genre and was compared to the works of Good Charlotte . The lyrics describe the feelings faced by the protagonist , following her heartbreak . Bill Lamb of About.com observed that " Beat of My Heart " and " Break My Heart " were " cookie cutter copies " of Avril Lavigne 's " Sk8er Boi " ( 2002 ) . " Come Clean " , " Why Not " and " Rock This World " are featured as club remixes in Most Wanted . According to Spence D. of IGN , " Come Clean " , remixed by Chris Cox exhibits elements of house music , while " Rock This World " displays " Kid Rock @-@ meets @-@ Aerosmith rock blitz " . He classified the remix of " Why Not " as a " hyperkinetic pop " sped @-@ up to a " level of sugar high bounce " . Another remix , of the Diane Warren @-@ penned " I Am " , is included as a hidden track , with added synths to give it a ' 80s indie feel . The version of " Girl Can Rock " featured on the album , according to Anthony Miccio of Baltimore City Paper has a chord progression similar to the song " Cherry Pie " by American band Warrant . The song displays elements of country music and the lyrics are a " statement of purpose " . Duff sings the chorus , backed by a guitar : " It ain 't no shock / The girl can rock " .

 Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave a mixed review of Most Wanted , stating that " hardcore fans will be hard @-@ pressed for a reason to add this to their collection " and that the new songs — " Wake Up " , " Beat of My Heart " and " Break My Heart " — " sound a bit like leftovers " . Although he wrote that Most Wanted " isn 't a terrible album by any means , it 's not particularly a good one , since Duff 's two pop albums [ Metamorphosis ( 2003 ) and Hilary Duff ( 2004 ) ] have distinctive personalities that don 't necessarily mesh together [ ... ] , and are both more fun than this . " Bill Lamb of About.com noted that the three new songs " seem to be marking time instead of finding a new direction " but said that " [ the ] remaining bulk of this collection is strong . " Anthony Miccio , from the Baltimore City Paper , wrote that the album " doesn 't signify the closure of a brief career " but is " meant to satisfy an audience that won 't be offended by the opportunity to buy their favorite songs again and again . " He noted that Duff 's voice was not strong enough and stated that the " rock tracks are surprisingly sluggish . " Talia Kraines of BBC Music commented that " ... there isn 't enough here to warrant a purchase if you 're already the owner of her back catalogue . But if you 're after your first taste of Duff @-@ flavoured pop to listen to in the background as you do your homework , then this album can do no harm . " 
 Spence D. of IGN stated that " the only draw for this album are the three new tracks and the three remixes . " He further commented that Most Wanted is a " filler album " and that " [ T ] he new songs that are served up still show Duff chasing trends rather than setting them and actively searching for her own voice and image . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine was critical of the album writing he " literally laughed out loud when I heard the <unk> was releasing a best @-@ of album titled Most Wanted . " He praised the Dead Executives produced tracks and concluded the review by writing that " apparently there aren 't even enough bearable moments in Duff 's recording career to fill one CD " . Gabriel Leong of MTV Southeast Asia started the review by writing " A greatest hits album seems a tad flagrant when you 've only had two albums so far . So let 's call this one a compilation album instead . " Leong noted that the title fitted the album perfectly and that it proves " its innocuous appeal of infectious bubblegum pop . " David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer commented that it was " a little early in the career " to release a greatest hits album and that it showcased that " Duff is more product than talent . " Aidin Vaziri of San Francisco Chronicle also commented that it was premature as it was too early in Duff 's career to release a greatest hits compilation . He commended the new tracks produced by the Dead Executives writing that they " help alleviate the feeling that this is a total cash grab . " In 2006 , Rolling Stone included the album in their <unk> Greatest Hits Albums Ever list .

 " Wake Up " was released as the lead single from Most Wanted . It was serviced to US mainstream radio on July 12 , 2005 , and was physically released on August 26 , 2005 . The song was met with generally mixed reviews from critics ; a few noted that the Madden @-@ produced track was a standout on the album . Chuck Taylor of Billboard called the song " an easy ace " and deemed it " a summer beach staple " . He also commended Duff 's vocal style in the song and remarked that it would " put her singing career on par with her hyperactive acting endeavors . " Stephen Thomas <unk> of Allmusic commented that it sounded like " leftovers " Commercially , " Wake Up " peaked within the top 10 in Italy , Ireland , Norway , Spain and the United Kingdom . In the United States , the song reached number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 , becoming Duff 's highest peak at the time . The accompanying music video for the song , directed by Marc Webb , portrays Duff in several different looks , representing styles from Tokyo , London , Paris and New York City . 
 " Beat of My Heart " was released as the second single from Most Wanted on December 12 , 2005 . The song received generally negative reviews from critics , who labelled it repetitive . Chuck Taylor of Billboard wrote : " Pop music is always appreciated , but this is a kiddie anthem , plain and simple , so repetitive and childlike [ ... ] that is hardly a contender for contemporary radio . " The song failed to chart in the US , but was a moderate success elsewhere , peaking within the top 10 in Italy , and the top @-@ twenty in Australia and Spain . The song 's accompanying music video , directed by Phil Harder , was influenced by the opening title sequences of James Bond films , and Duff sports different looks inspired by the different eras of the Bond films . In a few European countries , " Fly " was released as the second single from Most Wanted on March 13 , 2006 . It charted and peaked at number 20 on the UK Singles Chart and number 13 on the Italian Singles Chart . A third single from the album was planned to be released , but due to Duff 's busy schedule and exhaustion from touring , it did not materialize . Instead , " Supergirl " was released as a download @-@ only single on February 28 , 2006 . " Wake Up " and " Supergirl " were also used in an advertisement campaign to promote Candie 's ' clothing line for young women in 2005 – 06 .

 = STRAT @-@ X = 
 STRAT @-@ X , or Strategic @-@ Experimental , was a U.S. government @-@ sponsored study conducted during 1966 and 1967 that comprehensively analyzed the potential future of the U.S. nuclear deterrent force . At the time , the Soviet Union was making significant strides in nuclear weapons delivery , and also constructing anti @-@ ballistic missile defenses to protect strategic facilities . To address a potential technological gap between the two superpowers , U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara entrusted the classified STRAT @-@ X study to the Institute for Defense Analyses , which compiled a twenty @-@ volume report in nine months . The report looked into more than one hundred different weapons systems , ultimately resulting in the MGM @-@ 134 Midgetman and LGM @-@ 118 Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles , the Ohio @-@ class submarines , and the Trident submarine @-@ launched ballistic missiles , among others . Journalists have regarded STRAT @-@ X as a major influence on the course of U.S. nuclear policy . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the mid @-@ 1960s , reports received by U.S. intelligence agencies indicated that the Soviets were planning to deploy large numbers of highly accurate and powerful intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) . Later , the R @-@ 36 ICBM entered service . Possessing the greatest throw weight of any ICBM ever at 8 @.@ 8 tonnes ( 19 @,@ 000 lb ) , the R @-@ 36 was larger than the most modern ICBMs in the U.S. arsenal at the time . Due to its size , it was able to carry high @-@ yield warheads capable of destroying Minuteman hardened silos ( see <unk> ) . This was considered a significant risk to American ICBMs and , as a result , to the United States ' nuclear defense strategy by reducing the United States ' ability to retaliate with nuclear weapons if attacked . 
 At the same time , the Soviets were designing and constructing increasingly sophisticated anti @-@ ballistic missile defense systems to protect strategically important facilities around Moscow , reducing the threat posed by American ICBMs . These developments compelled the U.S. Secretary of Defense , Robert McNamara , to commission a study to look into ways of improving the survivability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal . 
 According to Graham Spinardi in his book From Polaris to Trident ( 1994 ) , STRAT @-@ X was a response by the U.S. Department of Defense 's Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering , Lloyd Wilson , to the U.S. Air Force ; the service was demanding a large ICBM called the WS @-@ 120A . Spinardi suggests that STRAT @-@ X was allowed to proceed so it could terminate the study for such a missile . Funding for the WS @-@ 120A would not be released by Secretary McNamara , and plans for such a missile were canceled in 1967 . 
 = = Study = = 
 The study was named " STRAT @-@ X " in order not to reveal its intentions , and also to eliminate partiality towards sea- , air- or land @-@ based systems . It was conducted by the Research and Engineering Support Division of the independent and non @-@ profit Institute for Defense Analyses ( IDA ) , which had conducted a study in early 1966 titled " Pen @-@ X " , upon which STRAT @-@ X was based . STRAT @-@ X was chaired by President of the IDA , General Maxwell D. Taylor , while the institution 's Fred Payne presided over STRAT @-@ X 's " working " panel . The panel also included executives from major independent corporations and defense contractors such as Boeing , Booz Allen Hamilton , Thiokol and TRW . The Advisory Committee members were mostly military officers , including U.S. Navy Rear Admirals George H. Miller and Levering Smith . 
 On 1 November 1966 , McNamara signed an order authorizing STRAT @-@ X , officially initiating the study . During STRAT @-@ X , the working panel was " encouraged to examine system concepts unrestrained by considerations of potential management problems or political influences . " The Secretary wanted new ideas about " path @-@ breaking " weapons systems that were either offensive or defensive in nature , unhindered by defense bureaucracy , which had the potential to stifle innovation . <unk> , land- and air @-@ based missile systems were investigated , but manned bombers and orbital systems were not . The group was also asked to consider the cost effectiveness of all systems , as well to predict possible Soviet responses . To meet this requirement , a series of documents were written from the perspective of the Soviet Minister of Defense General Andrei Grechko , complete with anti @-@ capitalistic statements and a prediction of the eventual triumph of socialism . In the end , a twenty @-@ volume report covered no fewer than 125 different ideas for missile systems , nine of which were reviewed in great detail . 
 = = = Findings and consequences = = = 
 Of the nine prospective weapons systems , five were land @-@ based . These were : " Rock Silo " — a system where missiles would be stored in hardened silos of granite bedrock in the Western and Northern United States ; " Soft Silo " — a similar system but with easily and cheaply constructed silos ; " Rock Tunnel " — a system where missiles would be transported around in deep underground networks before emerging at launch points ; " Soft Tunnel " — a similar tunnel but built more cheaply and easily ; and " Land Mobile " — a truck @-@ based system where road @-@ transporters traveled at speeds up to 35 miles per hour ( 56 km / h ) constantly around a dedicated and winding road system in 65 @,@ 000 square miles ( 170 @,@ 000 km2 ) of public land . 
 Of the remaining four , three were sea @-@ based . These were : " Canal @-@ Based " — a systems where missiles would be sailed in canals to confuse Soviet military planners ; " Ship @-@ Based " — a system where ships carrying missile canisters would travel around the world , hiding among other traffic ; and " Submarine @-@ Based " — a system where ballistic missile submarines would roam the oceans while carrying missile canisters outside their pressure hulls . The single air @-@ based based consideration was the " Air Launched ICBM " , which required large aircraft carrying standoff ballistic missiles to launch their payloads at the Soviet Union . 
 Despite the numerous options investigated during the study , none were fully implemented . Although the STRAT @-@ X " Land Mobile " option resulted in the MGM @-@ 134 Midgetman and LGM @-@ 118 Peacekeeper missiles , the fall of communism throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s resulted in the Midgetman being canceled while still a prototype , while only 50 out of the original 100 Peacekeeper missiles were ever fielded . Nevertheless , the study did inspire a number of developments in nuclear weapons delivery systems . In October 1974 , the U.S. Air Force successfully conducted an air launch of a Minuteman missile from a C @-@ 5 Galaxy , demonstrating the credibility of the " Air Launched ICBM " option of STRAT @-@ X. 
 Although the U.S. Navy then had several classes of ballistic missile submarines and submarine @-@ launched ballistic missile ( SLBM ) in service , the study placed a significant emphasis on the survivability of SLBMs . This resulted in the enormous Ohio @-@ class submarine and the Trident SLBMs which the Ohio class carried . The study originally called for dedicated slow @-@ moving missile @-@ carrying submarines ( instead of converted attack submarines ) to embark missiles outside their hulls and rely primarily on stealth for survivability . However , Admiral Hyman Rickover , director of the Naval Reactors office , wanted a boat capable of a burst of high speed in order to affect a safe " getaway " after launching the boat 's payload . As a result , the Ohio class was designed to accommodate enormous nuclear reactors to produce the required speed . Ohio @-@ class submarines carry their missiles inside of their hulls , despite STRAT @-@ X 's recommendation . Ohio @-@ class submarines and Trident missiles are still in service as of 2016 .

 = = Legacy = = 
 STRAT @-@ X had far @-@ reaching effects on the development and deployment of U.S. nuclear forces . It was the first time that the strategic requirements of the U.S. Armed Forces were addressed in a detailed and analytical manner . In a 2002 report by the RAND Corporation , STRAT @-@ X was described as " one of the most influential analyses ever conducted " for the U.S. Department of Defense . Journalist Peter Grier , in his Air Force magazine article " STRAT @-@ X " , described the study as " a wide @-@ ranging look at the future of U.S. weapons that shaped the nuclear triad for decades , and remains a model for such efforts today " . In 2006 , the Defense Science Board ( DFS ) noted STRAT @-@ X 's introduction of ideas and concepts that resulted in the Ohio @-@ class submarines and small and mobile ICBMs . The DFS also attributed the use of air @-@ launched cruise missiles , particularly those carried by the B @-@ 52 Stratofortress , to STRAT @-@ X despite their lack of references in the study .

 Ronald Arthur Saggers ( 15 May 1917 – 17 March 1987 ) was an Australian cricketer who played for New South Wales . He played briefly for the Australian team , playing six Tests between 1948 and 1950 . In his Test cricket career he made 24 dismissals ( 16 catches and 8 stumpings ) and scored 30 runs at an average of 10 @.@ 00 . 
 As a wicket @-@ keeper , Saggers was " tidy and unobtrusive " , and the understudy to Don Tallon on the 1948 Australian tour of England . The touring party , led by Donald Bradman in his last season , was nicknamed The Invincibles and was widely regarded as one of the strongest ever . Saggers played in the Test match at Headingley , where he took three catches , and his only other experience of Test cricket was on the tour to South Africa in 1949 – 50 , in which Tallon did not take part . Saggers played in all five Tests and took 21 dismissals , but Tallon replaced him for the home Ashes series against England the following season . 
 In domestic cricket , Saggers twice captained New South Wales in 1948 when the regular captain , Arthur Morris , was playing for Australia , and overall played domestic cricket from 1939 until 1951 .

 Saggers was born in the Sydney suburb of Marrickville in 1917 . He married Margaret Heather ( née Rankin ) in Annandale in 1941 . Outside cricket , Saggers worked in the insurance industry . 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 Saggers played twice for the New South Wales Colts team against Queensland Colts in 1937 , before making his first @-@ class debut against South Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground half way through the season in January 1940 . Selected as a specialist batsman — future Services player Stan Sismey kept wicket — Saggers made 45 and 57 batting at number six in his debut match , and went on to make two more first @-@ class appearances before the end of the season , ending with 208 runs at an average of 34 @.@ 66 and three catches behind the stumps . 
 His first full season from 1940 – 1941 saw him play in eight matches , scoring 413 runs with the bat at 29 @.@ 50 and passing fifty runs in an innings twice . His first match was away against Queensland where he scored 22 and 45 , making three stumpings , taking one catch and performing one run out , followed by scores of one and 33 in the home match , together with two stumpings . He scored 35 and four at home against Victoria , and then 45 in the second innings of the away match . On 22 November 1940 , barely a year into Saggers ' career , New South Wales faced a combined Queensland @-@ Victoria team at Brisbane . Saggers scored 58 as his team reached 429 in response to the oppositions 202 all out . In the Queensland @-@ Victoria team 's second innings , where they reached 416 , Saggers equalled the world record for most dismissals in an innings , taking seven catches . Saggers then went on to score 47 against South Australia , and 68 against Queensland on 1 January 1941 . In his final match before the outbreak of World War II , Saggers scored 63 runs against South Australia . He ended the season with 18 catches with the gloves and 13 stumpings . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 Between 1941 and 1942 , Saggers ' career was interrupted when he enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) on 6 December 1941 at Sydney . He served at the Elementary Flight School as Leading Aircraftman RA Saggers <unk> , until his discharge on 29 July 1942 , Saggers did not return to domestic cricket in Australia until 1945 , however . In the 1945 – 1946 season , he played in seven matches , scoring 168 runs at 21 @.@ 00 and taking 12 catches and five stumpings . He then suffered a drop in form with the bat ; in 1946 – 1947 he scored only 176 runs at 17 @.@ 60 from eight matches . However , he remained effective as a wicket @-@ keeper with 16 catches and seven stumpings . His batting form returned in 1947 – 1948 , scoring 298 runs from 10 matches at 27 @.@ 09 , reaching the 90s for the first time . He also enjoyed a very successful season with the gloves , a career high of 21 catches and four stumpings . 
 = = = Return = = = 
 Saggers was in stronger form following his tour to England . On 10 December 1948 , Saggers , included in AL Hassett 's XI for Test trial matches and benefits , as well as continuing his career at New South Wales , scored 38 for the latter against Queensland . At the same time , he aided Jack Moroney in his own comeback to cricket at New South Wales by suggesting he subtract three years from his age when he submitted his registration form . Overall in the 1948 – 1949 season he scored 300 runs from nine matches , his highest season total , at 25 @.@ 00 , and taking 21 catches and six stumpings . Following the South Africa tour of 1949 – 1950 he returned to Australia again for one final season from 1950 – 1951 , however played only one match , scoring five runs and taking two catches . Through his entire first @-@ class career of 77 appearances from 1939 until 1951 , he was to make one century in a tour match against Essex and eight half @-@ centuries for New South Wales , ending with 1 @,@ 888 runs at an average of 23 @.@ 89 , together with 146 catches and 75 stumpings .

 Saggers accompanied the 1948 Ashes tour to England as the reserve wicket @-@ keeper behind the first choice , Tallon . In the first County match against Leicestershire he scored six and took two catches , and against Cambridge University he made two stumpings and took one catch . He then played in the match against Essex where Australia reached 721 runs . Saggers made his highest first @-@ class score , 104 not out — the only first @-@ class century of his career — in a partnership of 166 runs in 65 minutes with Sam Loxton . Loxton , along with Bill Brown and Donald Bradman , also scored centuries . He then faced Oxford University , scoring six runs and taking one catch , followed by 22 and a stumping at Lancashire , 17 and another stumping at Hampshire , 22 against Yorkshire , 12 and four stumpings against Surrey , and three more stumpings against Gloucestershire . 
 Saggers ' Test debut took place at Headingley on 22 July 1948 during the Fourth Test of the Invincibles Ashes tour of England . England made 496 runs in their first innings , with Saggers taking catches to remove Denis Compton for 23 and Jim Laker for four . Australia replied with 458 , however Saggers was stumped by England 's wicket @-@ keeper Godfrey Evans off the bowling of Laker for only five runs . England 's second innings reached 365 with Saggers taking one catch to secure the wicket of Ken Cranston . However , an innings of 182 runs from Arthur Morris and 173 not out from Bradman meant that Saggers was not required to bat again in the second innings ; Australia defeating England by seven wickets . Saggers did not play in the remaining international matches of the 1948 Ashes series , and he ended the tour with 209 runs at an average of 23 @.@ 22 , including a career high score of 104 not out against Essex , 23 catches and 20 stumpings , also career records . In his book , Farewell to cricket , Bradman said of Saggers following the tour , " [ he ] had not quite the speed or agility of Tallon but could always be relied on for a solid performance . A most polished and unostentatious player . " 
 = = = South Africa = = = 
 Saggers ' next Test came in the 1949 tour of South Africa , where he was Australia 's first choice wicket @-@ keeper for all five Test matches . In light of the successful 1948 tour of England , Saggers commented " give me South Africa now , but I wouldn 't care to insure her future at double the rate I 'd insure Australia 's . " In the first warm up match against Natal Saggers scored 17 and took four catches , and in the second against North Eastern Transvaal he took one catch and made two stumpings , but was not needed to bat in either innings . He made 32 runs with three stumpings and three catches against the South African XI , made two stumpings but did not bat against the Orange Free State , and then scored one and nought not out against the Transvaal . 
 The first Test match of the tour , on 24 December 1949 at Johannesburg , saw him score 14 runs in the first innings before falling leg before wicket ( LBW ) to <unk> McCarthy , and taking three catches as South Africa were forced to follow on , Australia winning by an innings and 85 runs . In the Second Test at Cape Town , Saggers did get a chance to bat , with Australia declaring for 526 before he had the opportunity in the first innings . South Africa were forced to follow @-@ on ( bat twice in a row ) and were defeated by eight wickets . He did , however , complete three stumpings in South Africa 's first innings off the bowling of Colin McCool , along with four catches in the match . He also took two catches and completed one stumping in the Third Test , and made two runs in the first innings , though he did not bat in the second as Australia won by five wickets . The Fourth Test , again in Johannesburg , saw Saggers score five not out in the first innings and , though not being required to bat in the second innings as the match ended in a draw , taking two catches . 
 The Fifth Test was played at the Crusaders Ground at St. George 's Park in Port Elizabeth on 3 March to 6 March 1950 . Scoring four not out in the first innings , Saggers took two catches and completed four stumpings as South Africa were bowled out for 158 and 132 chasing Australia 's first innings 549 . With this innings and 259 run victory , Australia won the test series 4 – 0 , however Saggers would not play for his national team again upon the return of Tallon . Saggers was caught once , stumped once and out leg before wicket once but was never bowled in his international career . He ended his final year as an international player with 111 runs in first @-@ class cricket overall at 13 @.@ 87 , taking 30 catches and 20 stumpings , both of which were the highest he attained in one calendar year . He was replaced again by Tallon , however his form in turn declined and he was replaced by Gil Langley for the 1952 series against the West Indies . He retired from first class cricket in 1951 , and died in Harbord , New South Wales in 1987 .

 Mir ( Russian : Мир , IPA : [ <unk> ] ; lit. peace or world ) was a space station that operated in low Earth orbit from 1986 to 2001 , run by the Soviet Union and later by Russia . Mir was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996 . It had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft . At the time it was the largest artificial satellite in orbit , succeeded by the International Space Station after Mir 's orbit decayed . The station served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology , human biology , physics , astronomy , meteorology and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of space . 
 Mir was the first continuously inhabited long @-@ term research station in orbit and held the record for the longest continuous human presence in space at 3 @,@ 644 days until 23 October 2010 when it was surpassed by the ISS . It holds the record for the longest single human spaceflight , with Valeri Polyakov spending 437 days and 18 hours on the station between 1994 and 1995 . Mir was occupied for a total of twelve and a half years out of its fifteen @-@ year lifespan , having the capacity to support a resident crew of three , or larger crews for short visits . 
 Following the success of the Salyut programme , Mir represented the next stage in the Soviet Union 's space station programme . The first module of the station , known as the core module or base block , was launched in 1986 and followed by six further modules . Proton rockets were used to launch all of its components except for the docking module , which was installed by space shuttle mission STS @-@ 74 in 1995 . When complete , the station consisted of seven pressurised modules and several unpressurised components . Power was provided by several photovoltaic arrays attached directly to the modules . The station was maintained at an orbit between 296 km ( 184 mi ) and 421 km ( 262 mi ) altitude and traveled at an average speed of 27 @,@ 700 km / h ( 17 @,@ 200 mph ) , completing 15 @.@ 7 orbits per day . 
 The station was launched as part of the Soviet Union 's manned spaceflight programme effort to maintain a long @-@ term research outpost in space , and following the collapse of the USSR , was operated by the new Russian Federal Space Agency ( RKA ) . As a result , most of the station ' occupants were Soviet ; however , through international collaborations such as the Intercosmos , Euromir and Shuttle @-@ Mir programmes , the station was made accessible to space travelers from several Asian , European and North American nations . Mir was deorbited in March 2001 after funding was cut off . The cost of the Mir programme was estimated by former RKA General Director Yuri Koptev in 2001 as $ 4 @.@ 2 billion over its lifetime ( including development , assembly and orbital operation ) . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Mir was authorized on a 17 February 1976 decree , to design an improved model of the Salyut DOS @-@ 17K space stations . Four Salyut space stations had been launched since 1971 , with three more being launched during Mir 's development . It was planned that the station 's core module ( DOS @-@ 7 and the backup DOS @-@ 8 ) would be equipped with a total of four docking ports ; two at either end of the station as with the Salyut stations , and an additional two ports on either side of a docking sphere at the front of the station to enable further modules to expand the station 's capabilities . By August 1978 , this had evolved to the final configuration of one aft port and five ports in a spherical compartment at the forward end of the station . 
 It was originally planned that the ports would connect to 7 @.@ 5 @-@ tonne ( 8 @.@ 3 @-@ short @-@ ton ) modules derived from the Soyuz spacecraft . These modules would have used a Soyuz propulsion module , as in Soyuz and Progress , and the descent and orbital modules would have been replaced with a long laboratory module . However , following a February 1979 governmental resolution , the programme was consolidated with Vladimir <unk> 's manned Almaz military space station programme . The docking ports were reinforced to accommodate 20 @-@ tonne ( 22 @-@ short @-@ ton ) space station modules based on the TKS spacecraft . NPO Energia was responsible for the overall space station , with work subcontracted to KB Salyut , due to ongoing work on the Energia rocket and Salyut 7 , Soyuz @-@ T , and Progress spacecraft . KB Salyut began work in 1979 , and drawings were released in 1982 and 1983 . New systems incorporated into the station included the Salyut 5B digital flight control computer and <unk> flywheels ( taken from Almaz ) , Kurs automatic rendezvous system , <unk> satellite communications system , Elektron oxygen generators , and <unk> carbon dioxide scrubbers . 
 By early 1984 , work on Mir had halted while all resources were being put into the Buran programme in order to prepare the Buran spacecraft for flight testing . Funding resumed in early 1984 when Valentin <unk> was ordered by the Central Committee 's Secretary for Space and Defence to orbit Mir by early 1986 , in time for the 27th Communist Party Congress . 
 It was clear that the planned processing flow could not be followed and still meet the 1986 launch date . It was decided on Cosmonaut 's Day ( 12 April ) 1985 to ship the flight model of the base block to the Baikonur cosmodrome and conduct the systems testing and integration there . The module arrived at the launch site on 6 May , with 1100 of 2500 cables requiring rework based on the results of tests to the ground test model at <unk> . In October , the base block was rolled outside its <unk> to carry out communications tests . The first launch attempt on 16 February 1986 was scrubbed when the spacecraft communications failed , but the second launch attempt , on 19 February 1986 at 21 : 28 : 23 UTC , was successful , meeting the political deadline . 
 = = Station structure = = 
 = = = Assembly = = = 
 The orbital assembly of Mir began on February 19 , 1986 with the launch of the Proton @-@ K rocket . Four of the six modules which were later added ( Kvant @-@ 2 in 1989 , Kristall in 1990 , Spektr in 1995 and Priroda in 1996 ) followed the same sequence to be added to the main Mir complex . Firstly , the module would be launched independently on its own Proton @-@ K and chase the station automatically . It would then dock to the forward docking port on the core module 's docking node , then extend its Lyappa arm to mate with a fixture on the node 's exterior . The arm would then lift the module away from the forward docking port and rotate it on to the radial port where it was to mate , before lowering it to dock . The node was equipped with only two <unk> <unk> , however , which were required for dockings . This meant that , prior to the arrival of each new module , the node would have to be <unk> to allow spacewalking cosmonauts to manually relocate the drogue to the next port to be occupied . 
 The other two expansion modules , Kvant @-@ 1 in 1987 and the docking module in 1995 , followed different procedures . Kvant @-@ 1 , having , unlike the four modules mentioned above , no engines of its own , was launched attached to a tug based on the TKS spacecraft which delivered the module to the aft end of the core module instead of the docking node . Once hard docking had been achieved , the tug undocked and deorbited itself . The docking module , meanwhile , was launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis during STS @-@ 74 and mated to the orbiter 's Orbiter Docking System . Atlantis then docked , via the module , to Kristall , then left the module behind when it undocked later in the mission . Various other external components , including three truss structures , several experiments and other unpressurised elements were also mounted to the exterior of the station by cosmonauts conducting a total of eighty spacewalks over the course of the station 's history . 
 The station 's assembly marked the beginning of the third generation of space station design , being the first to consist of more than one primary spacecraft ( thus opening a new era in space architecture ) . First generation stations such as Salyut 1 and Skylab had monolithic designs , consisting of one module with no resupply capability , whilst the second generation stations Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 comprised a monolithic station with two ports to allow consumables to be replenished by cargo spacecraft such as Progress . The capability of Mir to be expanded with add @-@ on modules meant that each could be designed with a specific purpose in mind ( for instance , the core module functioned largely as living quarters ) , thus eliminating the need to install all the station 's equipment in one module . 
 = = = <unk> modules = = = 
 In its completed configuration , the space station consisted of seven different modules , each launched into orbit separately over a period of ten years by either Proton @-@ K rockets or Space Shuttle Atlantis . 
 = = = <unk> elements = = = 
 In addition to the pressurised modules , Mir featured several external components . The largest component was the Sofora girder , a large scaffolding @-@ like structure consisting of 20 segments which , when assembled , projected 14 metres from its mount on Kvant @-@ 1 . A self @-@ contained thruster block , the VDU , was mounted on the end of Sofora and was used to augment the roll @-@ control thrusters on the core module . The VDU 's increased distance from Mir 's axis allowed an 85 % decrease in fuel consumption , reducing the amount of propellant required to orient the station . A second girder , <unk> , was mounted aft of Sofora on Kvant @-@ 1 . This girder , a small prototype of a structure intended to be used on Mir @-@ 2 to hold large parabolic dishes away from the main station structure , was 5 metres long and used as a mounting point for externally mounted exposure experiments . 
 To assist in moving objects around the exterior of the station during EVAs , Mir featured two Strela cargo cranes mounted to the sides of the core module , used for moving spacewalking cosmonauts and parts . The cranes consisted of telescopic poles assembled in sections which measured around 1 @.@ 8 metres ( 6 ft ) when collapsed , but when extended using a hand crank were 14 metres ( 46 ft ) long , meaning that all of the station 's modules could easily be accessed during spacewalks . 
 Each module was fitted with a number of external components specific to the experiments that were carried out within that module , the most obvious being the Travers antenna mounted to Priroda . This synthetic aperture radar consisted of a large dish @-@ like framework mounted outside the module , with associated equipment within , used for Earth observations experiments , as was most of the other equipment on Priroda , including various radiometers and scan platforms . Kvant @-@ 2 also featured a number of scan platforms and was fitted with a mounting bracket to which the cosmonaut manoeuvring unit , or Ikar , was mated . This backpack was designed to assist cosmonauts in moving around the station and the planned Buran in a manner similar to the U.S. Manned Maneuvering Unit , but it was only used once , during EO @-@ 5 . 
 In addition to module @-@ specific equipment , Kvant @-@ 2 , Kristall , Spektr and Priroda were each equipped with one Lyappa arm , a robotic arm which , after the module had docked to the core module 's forward port , grappled one of two fixtures positioned on the core module 's docking node . The arriving module 's docking probe was then retracted , and the arm raised the module so that it could be pivoted 90 ° for docking to one of the four radial docking ports . 
 = = = Power supply = = = 
 Photovoltaic ( PV ) arrays powered Mir . The station used a 28 volt DC supply which provided 5- , 10- , 20- and 50 @-@ amp taps . When the station was illuminated by sunlight , several solar arrays mounted on the pressurised modules provided power to Mir 's systems and charged the nickel @-@ cadmium storage batteries installed throughout the station . The arrays rotated in only one degree of freedom over a 180 ° arc , and tracked the sun using sun sensors and motors installed in the array mounts . The station itself also had to be oriented to ensure optimum illumination of the arrays . When the station 's all @-@ sky sensor detected that Mir had entered Earth 's shadow , the arrays were rotated to the optimum angle predicted for reacquiring the sun once the station passed out of the shadow . The batteries , each of 60 Ah capacity , were then used to power the station until the arrays recovered their maximum output on the day side of Earth . 
 The solar arrays themselves were launched and installed over a period of eleven years , more slowly than originally planned , with the station continually suffering from a shortage of power as a result . The first two arrays , each 38 m2 ( 409 ft2 ) in area , were launched on the core module , and together provided a total of 9 kW of power . A third , dorsal panel was launched on Kvant @-@ 1 and mounted on the core module in 1987 , providing a further 2 kW from a 22 m2 ( 237 ft2 ) area . Kvant @-@ 2 , launched in 1989 , provided two 10 m ( 32 @.@ 8 ft ) long panels which supplied 3 @.@ 5 kW each , whilst Kristall was launched with two collapsible , 15 m ( 49 @.@ 2 ft ) long arrays ( providing 4 kW each ) which were intended to be moved to Kvant @-@ 1 and installed on mounts which were attached during a spacewalk by the EO @-@ 8 crew in 1991 . 
 This relocation was not begun , however , until 1995 , when the panels were retracted and the left panel installed on Kvant @-@ 1 . By this time all the arrays had degraded and were supplying much less power . To rectify this , Spektr ( launched in 1995 ) , which had initially been designed to carry two arrays , was modified to hold four , providing a total of 126 m2 ( 1360 ft2 ) of array with a 16 kW supply . Two further arrays were flown to the station on board the Space Shuttle Atlantis during STS @-@ 74 , carried on the docking module . The first of these , the Mir cooperative solar array , consisted of American photovoltaic cells mounted on a Russian frame . It was installed on the unoccupied mount on Kvant @-@ 1 in May 1996 and was connected to the socket that had previously been occupied by the core module 's dorsal panel , which was by this point barely supplying 1 kW . The other panel , originally intended to be launched on Priroda , replaced the Kristall panel on Kvant @-@ 1 in November 1997 , completing the station 's electrical system . 
 Total power supply by solar arrays , had the older ones not been degraded , would have been 42 kW by 1997 . 
 = = = Orbit control = = = 
 Mir was maintained in a near circular orbit with an average perigee of 354 km ( 220 mi ) and an average apogee of 374 km ( 232 mi ) , travelling at an average speed of 27 @,@ 700 km / h ( 17 @,@ 200 mph ) and completing 15 @.@ 7 orbits per day . As the station constantly lost altitude because of a slight atmospheric drag , it needed to be boosted to a higher altitude several times each year . This boost was generally performed by Progress resupply vessels , although during the Shuttle @-@ Mir programme the task was performed by U.S. Space Shuttles , and , prior to the arrival of Kvant @-@ 1 , the engines on the core module could also accomplish the task . 
 The attitude ( orientation ) of the station was independently determined by a set of externally mounted sun , star and horizon sensors . Attitude information was conveyed between updates by rate sensors . Attitude control was maintained by a combination of two mechanisms ; in order to hold a set attitude , a system of twelve control moment gyroscopes ( CMGs , or " gyrodynes " ) rotating at 10 @,@ 000 rpm kept the station oriented , six CMGs being located in each of the Kvant @-@ 1 and Kvant @-@ 2 modules . When the attitude of the station needed to be changed , the gyrodynes were disengaged , thrusters ( including those mounted directly to the modules , and the VDU thruster used for roll control mounted to the Sofora girder ) were used to attain the new attitude and the CMGs were <unk> . This was done fairly regularly depending on experimental needs ; for instance , Earth or astronomical observations required that the instrument recording images be continuously aimed at the target , and so the station was oriented to make this possible . Conversely , materials processing experiments required the minimisation of movement on board the station , and so Mir would be oriented in a gravity gradient attitude for stability . Prior to the arrival of the modules containing these gyrodynes , the station 's attitude was controlled using thrusters located on the core module alone , and , in an emergency , the thrusters on docked Soyuz spacecraft could be used to maintain the station 's orientation . 
 = = = Communications = = = 
 Radio communications provided telemetry and scientific data links between Mir and the RKA Mission Control Centre ( TsUP ) . Radio links were also used during rendezvous and docking procedures and for audio and video communication between crew members , flight controllers and family members . As a result , Mir was equipped with a number of communication systems used for different purposes . The station communicated directly with the ground via the Lira antenna mounted to the core module . The Lira antenna also had the capability to use the <unk> data relay satellite system ( which fell into disrepair in the 1990s ) and the network of Soviet tracking ships deployed in various locations around the world ( which also became unavailable in the 1990s ) . UHF radio was used by cosmonauts conducting EVAs . UHF was also employed by other spacecraft that docked to or undocked from the station , such as Soyuz , Progress , and the Space Shuttle , in order to receive commands from the TsUP and Mir crew members via the TORU system .

 At Mir 's orbital altitude , the force of Earth 's gravity was 88 % of sea level gravity . While the constant free fall of the station offered a perceived sensation of weightlessness , the onboard environment was not one of weightlessness or zero gravity . The environment was , however , often described as microgravity . This state of perceived weightlessness was not perfect , however , being disturbed by five separate effects : 
 The drag resulting from the residual atmosphere ; 
 <unk> acceleration caused by mechanical systems and the crew on the station ; 
 Orbital corrections by the on @-@ board gyroscopes ( which spun at 10 @,@ 000 rpm , producing vibrations of 166 @.@ 67 Hz ) or thrusters ; 
 Tidal forces . Any parts of Mir not at exactly the same distance from Earth tended to follow separate orbits . However , as each point was physically part of the station , this was impossible , and so each component was subject to small accelerations from tidal forces ; 
 The differences in orbital plane between different locations on the station . 
 = = = Life support = = = 
 Mir 's Environmental Control and Life Support System ( ECLSS ) provided or controlled atmospheric pressure , fire detection , oxygen levels , waste management and water supply . The highest priority for the ECLSS was the station 's atmosphere , but the system also collected , processed , and stored waste and water produced and used by the crew — a process that recycles fluid from the sink , toilet , and condensation from the air . The Elektron system generated oxygen . Bottled oxygen and Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation ( SFOG ) canisters , a system known as Vika , provided backup . Carbon dioxide was removed from the air by the <unk> system . Other byproducts of human metabolism , such as methane from the intestines and ammonia from sweat , were removed by activated charcoal filters . Similar systems are presently used on the International Space Station . 
 The atmosphere on Mir was similar to Earth 's . Normal air pressure on the station was 101 @.@ 3 kPa ( 14 @.@ 7 psi ) ; the same as at sea level on Earth . An Earth @-@ like atmosphere offers benefits for crew comfort , and is much safer than the alternative , a pure oxygen atmosphere , because of increased fire risk such as occurred with Apollo 1 .

 In the early 1980s , NASA planned to launch a modular space station called Freedom as a counterpart to Mir , while the Soviets were planning to construct Mir @-@ 2 in the 1990s as a replacement for the station . Because of budget and design constraints , Freedom never progressed past mock @-@ ups and minor component tests and , with the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Space Race , the project was nearly cancelled entirely by the United States House of Representatives . The post @-@ Soviet economic chaos in Russia also led to the cancellation of Mir @-@ 2 , though only after its base block , DOS @-@ 8 , had been constructed . Similar budgetary difficulties were faced by other nations with space station projects , which prompted the U.S. government to negotiate with European states , Russia , Japan , and Canada in the early 1990s to begin a collaborative project . In June 1992 , American president George H. W. Bush and Russian president Boris Yeltsin agreed to cooperate on space exploration . The resulting Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes called for a short joint space programme with one American astronaut deployed to the Russian space station Mir and two Russian cosmonauts deployed to a Space Shuttle . 
 In September 1993 , U.S. Vice President Al Gore , Jr . , and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin announced plans for a new space station , which eventually became the International Space Station . They also agreed , in preparation of this new project , that the United States would be heavily involved in the Mir programme as part of an international project known as the Shuttle – Mir Programme . The project , sometimes called " Phase One " , was intended to allow the United States to learn from Russian experience in long @-@ duration spaceflight and to foster a spirit of cooperation between the two nations and their space agencies , the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) and the Russian Federal Space Agency ( Roskosmos ) . The project prepared the way for further cooperative space ventures , specifically , " Phase Two " of the joint project , the construction of the International Space Station ( ISS ) . The programme was announced in 1993 ; the first mission started in 1994 , and the project continued until its scheduled completion in 1998 . Eleven Space Shuttle missions , a joint Soyuz flight , and almost 1000 cumulative days in space for U.S. astronauts occurred over the course of seven long @-@ duration expeditions .

 Inside , the 130 @-@ tonne ( 140 @-@ short @-@ ton ) Mir resembled a cramped labyrinth , crowded with hoses , cables and scientific instruments — as well as articles of everyday life , such as photos , children 's drawings , books and a guitar . It commonly housed three crew members , but was capable of supporting as many as six for up to a month . The station was designed to remain in orbit for around five years , but ended up remaining in orbit for fifteen . As a result , NASA astronaut John Blaha reported that , with the exception of Priroda and Spektr , which were added later into the station 's life , Mir did look used , which is to be expected given it had been lived in for ten to eleven years without being brought home and cleaned . 
 = = = Crew schedule = = = 
 The time zone used on board Mir was Moscow Time ( UTC + 03 ) . The windows were covered during night hours to give the impression of darkness because the station experienced 16 sunrises and sunsets a day . A typical day for the crew began with a wake @-@ up at 08 : 00 , followed by two hours of personal hygiene and breakfast . Work was conducted from 10 : 00 until 13 : 00 , followed by an hour of exercise and an hour 's lunch break . Three more hours of work and another hour of exercise followed lunch , and the crews began preparing for their evening meal at about 19 : 00 . The cosmonauts were free to do as they wished in the evening , and largely worked to their own pace during the day . 
 In their spare time , crews were able to catch up with work , observe the Earth below , respond to letters , drawings and other items brought from Earth ( and give them an official stamp to show they had been aboard Mir ) , or make use of the station 's ham radio . Two amateur radio call signs , <unk> and <unk> , were assigned to Mir in the late 1980s , allowing amateur radio operators on Earth to communicate with the cosmonauts . The station was also equipped with a supply of books and films for the crew to read and watch . 
 NASA astronaut Jerry Linenger related how life on board Mir was structured and lived according to the detailed itineraries provided by ground control . Every second on board was accounted for and all activities were timetabled . After working some time on Mir , Linenger came to feel that the order in which his activities were allocated did not represent the most logical or efficient order possible for these activities . He decided to perform his tasks in an order that he felt enabled him to work more efficiently , be less fatigued , and suffer less from stress . Linenger noted that his comrades on Mir did not " improvise " in this way , and as a medical doctor he observed the effects of stress on his comrades that he believed was the outcome of following an itinerary without making modifications to it . Despite this , however , he commented that his comrades performed all their tasks in a supremely professional manner . 
 Astronaut Shannon Lucid , who set the record for longest stay in space by a woman while aboard Mir ( surpassed by Sunita Williams 11 years later on the ISS ) , also commented about working aboard Mir saying " I think going to work on a daily basis on Mir is very similar to going to work on a daily basis on an outstation in Antarctica . The big difference with going to work here is the isolation , because you really are isolated . You don 't have a lot of support from the ground . You really are on your own . " 
 = = = Exercise = = = 
 The most significant adverse effects of long @-@ term weightlessness are muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton , or spaceflight osteopenia . Other significant effects include fluid redistribution , a slowing of the cardiovascular system , decreased production of red blood cells , balance disorders , and a weakening of the immune system . Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass , nasal congestion , sleep disturbance , excess flatulence , and <unk> of the face . These effects begin to reverse quickly upon return to the Earth . 
 To prevent some of these effects , the station was equipped with two treadmills ( in the core module and Kvant @-@ 2 ) and a stationary bicycle ( in the core module ) ; each cosmonaut was to cycle the equivalent of 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) and run the equivalent of 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) per day . Cosmonauts used bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill . Researchers believe that exercise is a good countermeasure for the bone and muscle density loss that occurs in low @-@ gravity situations . 
 = = = Hygiene = = = 
 There were two space toilets ( <unk> ) on Mir , located in the core module and Kvant @-@ 2 . They used a fan @-@ driven suction system similar to the Space Shuttle Waste Collection System . The user is first fastened to the toilet seat , which was equipped with spring @-@ loaded restraining bars to ensure a good seal . A lever operated a powerful fan and a suction hole slid open : the air stream carried the waste away . Solid waste was collected in individual bags which were stored in an aluminium container . Full containers were transferred to Progress spacecraft for disposal . Liquid waste was evacuated by a hose connected to the front of the toilet , with anatomically appropriate " urine funnel adapters " attached to the tube so both men and women could use the same toilet . Waste was collected and transferred to the Water Recovery System , where it was recycled back into drinking water , although this was usually used to produce oxygen via the Elektron system . 
 Mir featured a shower , the <unk> , located in Kvant @-@ 2 . It was an improvement on the units installed in previous Salyut stations , but proved difficult to use due to the time required to set up , use , and stow . The shower , which featured a plastic curtain and fan to collect water via an airflow , was later converted into a steam room , eventually having its plumbing removed and the space was reused . When the shower was unavailable , crew members washed using wet wipes , with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube @-@ like container , or using a washbasin equipped with a plastic hood , located in the core module . Crews were also provided with rinse @-@ less shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water . 
 On a 1998 visit to Mir , bacteria and larger organisms were found to have proliferated in water globules formed from moisture that had condensed behind service panels . 
 = = = Sleeping in space = = = 
 The station provided two permanent crew quarters , the <unk> , <unk> @-@ sized booths set towards the rear of the core module , each featuring a tethered sleeping bag , a fold @-@ out desk , a porthole , and storage for personal effects . Visiting crews had no allocated sleep module , instead attaching a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall ; U.S. astronauts installed themselves within Spektr until a collision with a Progress spacecraft caused the depressurization of that module . It was important that crew accommodations be well ventilated ; otherwise , astronauts could wake up oxygen @-@ deprived and gasping for air , because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide had formed around their heads . 
 = = = Food and drink = = = 
 Most of the food eaten by station crews was frozen , refrigerated or canned . Menus were prepared by the cosmonauts , with the help of a dietitian , before their flight to the station . The diet was designed to provide around 100 g of protein , 130 g of fat and 330 g of carbohydrates per day , in addition to appropriate mineral and vitamin supplements . Meals were spaced out through the day to aid assimilation . Canned food such as jellied beef tongue was placed into a niche in the core module 's table , where it could be warmed in 5 – 10 minutes . Usually , crews drank tea , coffee and fruit juices , but , unlike the ISS , the station also had a supply of cognac and vodka for special occasions . 
 = = = Microbiological environmental hazards = = = 
 In the 1990s samples of extremophile molds were taken from Mir . Ninety species of micro @-@ organisms were found in 1990 , four years after the station 's launch . By the time of its decommission in 2001 , the number of known different micro @-@ organisms had grown to 140 . As space stations get older , the problems with contamination get worse . Molds that develop aboard space stations can produce acids that degrade metal , glass and rubber . The molds in Mir were found growing behind panels and inside air @-@ conditioning equipment . The molds also caused bad smell , which was often cited as visitors ' strongest impressions . 
 Some biologists were concerned about the mutant fungi being a major microbiological hazard for humans , and reaching Earth in the splashdown , after having been in an isolated environment for 15 years .

 Mir was visited by a total of 28 long @-@ duration or " principal " crews , each of which was given a sequential expedition number formatted as EO @-@ X. Expeditions varied in length ( from the 72 @-@ day flight of the crew of EO @-@ 28 to the 437 @-@ day flight of Valeri Polyakov ) , but generally lasted around six months . Principal expedition crews consisted of two or three crew members , who often launched as part of one expedition but returned with another ( Polyakov launched with EO @-@ 14 and landed with EO @-@ 17 ) . The principal expeditions were often supplemented with visiting crews who remained on the station during the week @-@ long handover period between one crew and the next before returning with the departing crew , the station 's life support system being able to support a crew of up to six for short periods . The station was occupied for a total of four distinct periods ; 12 March – 16 July 1986 ( EO @-@ 1 ) , 5 February 1987 – 27 April 1989 ( EO @-@ 2 – EO @-@ 4 ) , the record @-@ breaking run from 5 September 1989 – 28 August 1999 ( EO @-@ 5 – EO @-@ 27 ) , and 4 April – 16 June 2000 ( EO @-@ 28 ) . By the end , it had been visited by 104 different people from twelve different nations , making it the most visited spacecraft in history ( a record later surpassed by the International Space Station ) . 
 = = = = Early existence = = = = 
 Due to the pressure to launch the station on schedule , mission planners were left without Soyuz spacecraft or modules to launch to the station at first . It was decided to launch Soyuz T @-@ 15 on a dual mission to both Mir and Salyut 7 . 
 Leonid <unk> and Vladimir Solovyov first docked with Mir on 15 March 1986 . During their nearly 51 @-@ day stay on Mir , they brought the station online and checked its systems . They unloaded two Progress spacecraft launched after their arrival , Progress 25 and Progress 26 . 
 On 5 May 1986 , they undocked from Mir for a day @-@ long journey to Salyut 7 . They spent 51 days there and gathered 400 kg of scientific material from Salyut 7 for return to Mir . While Soyuz T @-@ 15 was at Salyut 7 , the unmanned Soyuz TM @-@ 1 arrived at the unoccupied Mir and remained for 9 days , testing the new Soyuz TM model . Soyuz T @-@ 15 <unk> with Mir on 26 June and delivered the experiments and 20 instruments , including a multichannel spectrometer . The EO @-@ 1 crew spent their last 20 days on Mir conducting Earth observations before returning to Earth on 16 July 1986 , leaving the new station unoccupied . 
 The second expedition to Mir , EO @-@ 2 , launched on Soyuz TM @-@ 2 on 5 February 1987 . During their stay , the Kvant @-@ 1 module , launched on 30 March 1987 , arrived . It was the first experimental version of a planned series of ' <unk> ' modules scheduled to be launched to Mir on Buran . Kvant @-@ 1 was originally planned to dock with Salyut 7 ; however , due to technical problems during its development , it was reassigned to Mir . The module carried the first set of six gyroscopes for attitude control . The module also carried instruments for X @-@ ray and ultraviolet astrophysical observations . 
 The initial rendezvous of the Kvant @-@ 1 module with Mir on 5 April 1987 was troubled by the failure of the onboard control system . After the failure of the second attempt to dock , the resident cosmonauts , Yuri Romanenko and Aleksandr <unk> , conducted an EVA to fix the problem . They found a trash bag which had been left in orbit after the departure of one of the previous cargo ships and was now located between the module and the station , which prevented the docking . After removing the bag , docking was completed on 12 April . 
 The Soyuz TM @-@ 2 launch was the beginning of a string of 6 Soyuz launches and three long @-@ duration crews between 5 February 1987 and 27 April 1989 . This period also saw the first international visitors , Muhammed Faris ( Syria ) , Abdul Ahad Mohmand ( Afghanistan ) and Jean @-@ Loup Chrétien ( France ) . With the departure of EO @-@ 4 on Soyuz TM @-@ 7 on 27 April 1989 the station was again left unoccupied .

 The launch of Soyuz TM @-@ 8 on 5 September 1989 marked the beginning of the longest human presence in space , until 23 October 2010 , when this record was surpassed by the ISS . It also marked the beginning of Mir 's second expansion . The Kvant @-@ 2 and Kristall modules were now ready for launch . Alexander <unk> and Aleksandr <unk> docked with Mir and brought the station out of its five @-@ month hibernation . On 29 September the cosmonauts installed equipment in the docking system in preparation for the arrival of Kvant @-@ 2 , the first of the 20 tonne add @-@ on modules based on the TKS spacecraft from the Almaz programme . 
 After a 40 @-@ day delay caused by faulty computer chips , Kvant @-@ 2 was launched on 26 November 1989 . After problems deploying the craft 's solar array and with the automated docking systems on both Kvant @-@ 2 and Mir , the new module was docked manually on 6 December . Kvant @-@ 2 added a second set of <unk> to Mir , and brought the new life support systems for recycling water and generating oxygen , reducing dependence on ground resupply . The module featured a large airlock with a one @-@ metre hatch . A special backpack unit ( known as Ikar ) , an equivalent of the U.S. Manned Maneuvering Unit , was located inside Kvant @-@ 2 's airlock . 
 Soyuz TM @-@ 9 launched EO @-@ 6 crew members Anatoly Solovyev and Aleksandr <unk> on 11 February 1990 . While docking , the EO @-@ 5 crew noted that three thermal blankets on the ferry were loose , potentially creating problems on reentry , but it was decided that they would be manageable . Their stay on board Mir saw the addition of the Kristall module , launched 31 May 1990 . The first docking attempt on 6 June was aborted due to an attitude control thruster failure . Kristall arrived at the front port on 10 June and was relocated to the lateral port opposite Kvant @-@ 2 the next day , restoring the equilibrium of the complex . Due to the delay in the docking of Kristall , EO @-@ 6 was extended by 10 days to permit the activation of the module ’ s systems and to accommodate an EVA to repair the loose thermal blankets on Soyuz TM @-@ 9 . 
 Kristall contained furnaces for use in producing crystals under microgravity conditions ( hence the choice of name for the module ) . The module was also equipped with biotechnology research equipment , including a small greenhouse for plant cultivation experiments which was equipped with a source of light and a feeding system , in addition to equipment for astronomical observations . The most obvious features of the module , however , were the two Androgynous Peripheral Attach System ( APAS @-@ 89 ) docking ports designed to be compatible with the Buran spacecraft . Although they were never used in a Buran docking , they were useful later during the Shuttle @-@ Mir programme , providing a berthing location for U.S Space Shuttles . 
 The EO @-@ 7 relief crew arrived aboard Soyuz TM @-@ 10 on 3 August 1990 . The new crew arrived at Mir with quail for Kvant @-@ 2 's cages , one of which laid an egg en route to the station . It was returned to Earth , along with 130 kg of experiment results and industrial products , in Soyuz TM @-@ 9 . Two more expeditions , EO @-@ 8 and EO @-@ 9 , continued the work of their predecessors whilst tensions grew back on Earth .

 The EO @-@ 10 crew , launched aboard Soyuz TM @-@ 13 on 2 October 1991 , was the last crew to launch from the USSR and continued the occupation of Mir through the fall of the Soviet Union . The crew is notable for having launched as Soviet citizens and returning to earth as Russians . The newly formed Russian Federal Space Agency ( Roskosmos ) was unable to finance the <unk> Spektr and Priroda modules , instead putting them into storage and ending Mir 's second expansion . 
 The first manned mission flown from an independent Kazakhstan was Soyuz TM @-@ 14 , launched on 17 March 1992 , which carried the EO @-@ 11 crew to Mir , docking on 19 March before the departure of Soyuz TM @-@ 13 . On 17 June , Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President George H. W. Bush announced what would later become the Shuttle @-@ Mir programme , a cooperative venture which proved useful to the cash @-@ strapped Roskosmos ( and led to the eventual completion and launch of Spektr and Priroda ) . EO @-@ 12 followed in July , alongside a brief visit by French astronaut Michel <unk> . The following crew , EO @-@ 13 , began preparations for the Shuttle @-@ Mir programme by flying to the station in a modified spacecraft , Soyuz TM @-@ 16 ( launched on 26 January 1993 ) , which was equipped with an APAS @-@ 89 docking system rather than the usual probe @-@ and @-@ drogue , enabling it to dock to Kristall and test the port which would later be used by U.S. space shuttles . The spacecraft also enabled controllers to obtain data on the dynamics of docking a spacecraft to a space station off the station 's longitudinal axis , in addition to data on the structural integrity of this configuration via a test called <unk> conducted on 28 January . Soyuz TM @-@ 15 , meanwhile , departed with the EO @-@ 12 crew on 1 February . 
 Throughout the period following the collapse of the USSR , crews on Mir experienced occasional reminders of the economic chaos occurring in Russia . The initial cancellation of Spektr and Priroda was the first such sign , followed by the reduction in communications as a result of the fleet of tracking ships being withdrawn from service by Ukraine . The new Ukrainian government also vastly raised the price of the Kurs docking systems , manufactured in Kiev – the Russians ' attempts to reduce their dependence on Kurs would later lead to accidents during TORU tests in 1997 . Various Progress spacecraft had parts of their cargoes missing , either because the consumable in question had been unavailable , or because the ground crews at Baikonur had , in desperation , looted them . The problems became particularly obvious during the launch of the EO @-@ 14 crew aboard Soyuz TM @-@ 17 in July ; shortly before launch there was a black @-@ out at the pad , and the entire power supply to the nearby city of <unk> failed an hour after launch . Nevertheless , the spacecraft launched on time and arrived at the station two days later . All of Mir 's ports , however , were occupied , and so Soyuz TM @-@ 17 had to station @-@ keep 200 metres away from the station for half an hour before docking whilst Progress M @-@ 18 vacated the core module 's front port and departed . 
 The EO @-@ 13 crew departed on 22 July , and soon after Mir passed through the annual <unk> meteor shower , during which the station was hit by several particles . A spacewalk was conducted on 28 September to inspect the station 's hull , but no serious damage was reported . Soyuz TM @-@ 18 arrived on 10 January 1994 carrying the EO @-@ 15 crew ( including Valeri Polyakov , who was to remain on Mir for 14 months ) , and Soyuz TM @-@ 17 left on 14 January . The undocking was unusual , however , in that the spacecraft was to pass along Kristall in order to obtain photographs of the APAS to assist in the training of space shuttle pilots . Due to an error in setting up the control system , the spacecraft struck the station a glancing blow during the manoeuvre , scratching the exterior of Kristall . 
 On 3 February 1994 , Mir veteran Sergei Krikalev became the first Russian cosmonaut to launch on a U.S. spacecraft , flying on Space Shuttle Discovery during STS @-@ 60 . 
 The launch of Soyuz TM @-@ 19 , carrying the EO @-@ 16 crew , was delayed due to the unavailability of a payload fairing for the booster that was to carry it , but the spacecraft eventually left Earth on 1 July 1994 and docked two days later . They stayed only four months to allow the Soyuz schedule to line up with the planned space shuttle manifest , and so Polyakov greeted a second resident crew in October , prior to the undocking of Soyuz TM @-@ 19 , when the EO @-@ 17 crew arrived in Soyuz TM @-@ 20 .

 The 3 February launch of Space Shuttle Discovery , flying STS @-@ 63 , opened operations on Mir for 1995 . Referred to as the " near @-@ Mir " mission , the mission saw the first rendezvous of a space shuttle with Mir as the orbiter approached within 37 feet ( 11 m ) of the station as a dress rehearsal for later docking missions and for equipment testing . Five weeks after Discovery 's departure , the EO @-@ 18 crew , including the first U.S. cosmonaut Norman Thagard , arrived in Soyuz TM @-@ 21 . The EO @-@ 17 crew left a few days later , with Polyakov completing his record @-@ breaking 437 @-@ day spaceflight . During EO @-@ 18 , the Spektr science module ( which served as living and working space for American astronauts ) was launched aboard a Proton rocket and docked to the station , carrying research equipment from America and other nations . The expedition 's crew returned to Earth aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis following the first Shuttle – Mir docking mission , STS @-@ 71 . Atlantis , launched on 27 June 1995 , successfully docked with Mir on 29 June becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to dock with a Russian spacecraft since the ASTP in 1975 . The orbiter delivered the EO @-@ 19 crew and returned the EO @-@ 18 crew to Earth . The EO @-@ 20 crew were launched on 3 September , followed in November by the arrival of the docking module during STS @-@ 74 .
