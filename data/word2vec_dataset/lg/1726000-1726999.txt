 After making the playoffs in 1984 and 1985 , the Giants entered the 1986 season as one of the favorites to win the Super Bowl . They began the season with 31 – 28 loss to the Dallas Cowboys , before winning five consecutive games . After losing 17 – 12 to the Seattle Seahawks in week seven , the Giants won their final nine regular season games . Following the regular season , coach Bill Parcells won the NFL Coach of the Year Award , and eight Giants were named to the Pro Bowl . The Giants ' defense , nicknamed the Big Blue Wrecking Crew , finished second in the league in points and yards allowed . 
 The 1986 Giants had been ranked as one of the greatest NFL teams of all time by fans , and members of the media . It was this Giants team that popularized the practice of the " Gatorade shower " , which entailed the players dousing members of the coaching staff with Gatorade near the end of a victorious game .

 ( John <unk> voice ) It was these 1986 Giants that popularized the football tradition of dousing the head coach with a cooler of Gatorade near the end of a victorious game . This originated in 1984 when Jim Burt , incensed by what he thought was mistreatment he received during practice , exacted revenge on Bill Parcells by dumping a cooler of Gatorade on him . Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson later picked up on the ploy and would often sneak up on Coach Parcells near the end of games to dump the remaining Gatorade over his head . The dousing was a big hit with fans , and the Gatorade dumping continued throughout the season after each win , with Taylor , Carson , and several other players ( Burt had since ceased doing it ) concocting increasingly elaborate , sneaky , and playful ruses , so as to at least attempt to keep the inevitable dousing a surprise .

 A rainband is a cloud and precipitation structure associated with an area of rainfall which is significantly elongated . Rainbands can be stratiform or convective , and are generated by differences in temperature . When noted on weather radar imagery , this precipitation elongation is referred to as banded structure . Rainbands within tropical cyclones are curved in orientation . Tropical cyclone rainbands contain showers and thunderstorms that , together with the eyewall and the eye , constitute a hurricane or tropical storm . The extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclone 's intensity . 
 Rainbands spawned near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which are able to produce tornadoes . Rainbands associated with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front 's orientation due to the formation of a low @-@ level barrier jet . Bands of thunderstorms can form with sea breeze and land breeze boundaries , if enough moisture is present . If sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front , they can mask the location of the cold front itself . Banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an extratropical cyclone can yield significant amounts of rain or snow . Behind extratropical cyclones , rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the Great Lakes . If the atmosphere is cold enough , these rainbands can yield heavy snow . 
 = = Extratropical cyclones = = 
 Rainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion , and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature . In an atmosphere with rich low level moisture and vertical wind shear , narrow , convective rainbands known as squall lines generally in the cyclone 's warm sector , ahead of strong cold fronts associated with extratropical cyclones . Wider rain bands can occur behind cold fronts , which tend to have more stratiform , and less convective , precipitation . Within the cold sector north to northwest of a cyclone center , in colder cyclones , small scale , or mesoscale , bands of heavy snow can occur within a cyclone 's comma head precipitation pattern with a width of 32 kilometres ( 20 mi ) to 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) . These bands in the comma head are associated with areas of <unk> , or zones of strengthening temperature contrast . Southwest of extratropical cyclones , curved flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm Great Lakes can lead to narrow lake effect snow bands which bring significant localized snowfall . 
 = = Tropical cyclones = = 
 Rainbands exist in the periphery of tropical cyclones , which point towards the cyclone 's center of low pressure . Rainbands within tropical cyclones require ample moisture and a low level pool of cooler air . Bands located 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) to 150 kilometres ( 93 mi ) from a cyclone 's center migrate outward . They are capable of producing heavy rains and squalls of wind , as well as tornadoes , particularly in the storm 's right @-@ front quadrant . 
 Some rainbands move closer to the center , forming a secondary , or outer , eyewall within intense hurricanes . Spiral rainbands are such a basic structure to a tropical cyclone that in most tropical cyclone basins , use of the satellite @-@ based Dvorak technique is the primary method used to determine a tropical cyclone 's maximum sustained winds . Within this method , the extent of spiral banding and difference in temperature between the eye and eyewall is used to assign a maximum sustained wind and a central pressure . Central pressure values for their centers of low pressure derived from this technique are approximate . 
 Different programs have been studying these rainbands , including <unk> . 
 = = Forced by geography = = 
 Convective rainbands can form parallel to terrain on its windward side , due to lee waves triggered by hills just upstream of the cloud 's formation . Their spacing is normally 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) to 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) apart . When bands of precipitation near frontal zones approach steep topography , a low @-@ level barrier jet stream forms parallel to and just prior to the mountain ridge , which slows down the frontal rainband just prior to the mountain barrier . If enough moisture is present , sea breeze and land breeze fronts can form convective rainbands . Sea breeze front thunderstorm lines can become strong enough to mask the location of an approaching cold front by evening . The edge of ocean currents can lead to the development of thunderstorm bands due to heat differential at this interface . Downwind of islands , bands of showers and thunderstorms can develop due to low level wind convergence downwind of the island edges . Offshore California , this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts . 
 = Statue of James II , Trafalgar Square = 
 The statue of James II is an outdoor bronze sculpture located in the front garden of the National Gallery at Trafalgar Square in London , United Kingdom . Probably inspired by French statues of the same period , it depicts James II of England as a Roman emperor , wearing Roman armour and a laurel wreath ( traditionally awarded to a victorious Roman commander ) . It originally also depicted him holding a baton . It was produced by the workshop of Grinling Gibbons , though probably not by Gibbons himself . The statue has been relocated several times since it was first erected in the grounds of the old Palace of Whitehall in 1686 , only two years before James II was deposed . 
 = = Description = = 
 The statue is executed in bronze and depicts James II as a Roman emperor . He is shown standing in a <unk> pose and pointing downwards in " great ease of attitude and a certain serenity of air " , as Allan Cunningham described it . It formerly held a baton in its right hand , though this is now missing . The face is said to be an excellent depiction of the king . Unusually for the time , Gibbons sought a degree of fidelity to original classical styles ; James is depicted wearing a laurel wreath on top of short hair , whereas other imperial @-@ style statues of both Charles II and James II depicted the two kings with an anachronistic combination of Roman armour and a 17th @-@ century <unk> . The statue was probably inspired by similar imperial portrayals of Louis XIV of France . One in particular , a colossal statue by Martin Desjardins of Louis XIV wearing Roman armour with a laurel wreath and baton , is so similar in type to the figures of Charles II and James II that it may have been their direct inspiration . 
 The plinth is inscribed with the legend <unk> <unk> / DEI <unk> / <unk> <unk> / <unk> ET / <unk> / REX / <unk> <unk> / ANNO <unk> , which translates to : " James II , by the grace of God , King of England , Scotland , France and Ireland . Defender of the Faith . 1686 . "

 The statue of James II is one of three of the Stuart monarchs commissioned by the royal servant Tobias <unk> from Grinling Gibbons 's workshop in the 1670s and ' 80s , the others being of James 's brother and predecessor Charles II : an equestrian statue in Windsor Castle and a standing figure at the Royal Hospital in Chelsea . The statue of James II was commissioned for the Palace of Whitehall , apparently at the same time as the standing Charles II , and the two works might have been intended as pendent pieces . It was produced in the workshop of Grinling Gibbons at a reported cost of £ 300 ( equivalent to about £ 42 @,@ 000 at 2014 prices ) . Although long attributed to Gibbons himself , large @-@ scale sculptures were not his <unk> and it is probable that the statue 's principal originator was the Dutch sculptor <unk> <unk> III ( also known as Arnold <unk> ) , who was working at Gibbons ' workshop at the time . 
 The James II was erected at the Palace of Whitehall on 24 March 1686 , as recorded by a contemporary , Sir John Bramston the Younger . George Vertue , who found an agreement and a receipt of payment for the work , wrote that it was " modelled & made by Lawrence [ <unk> ] ( of Brussels ) ... & <unk> [ i.e. Peter Van <unk> ] ( of Mechlin ) who was <unk> by ... Gibbons " , and that Thomas <unk> was involved in the casting . A series of five drawings in the British Museum , which might be for either the standing Charles II or the James II , is attributed variously to Gibbons or to Peter Van <unk> . Its artistic qualities were praised by J.P. Malcolm in his 1803 history , London <unk> , in which he wrote : 
 There is but one fault in the figure , and that is the attitude . The King seems to point with a baton at the earth , to which his eyes are directed ; but why ? Surely this is an egregious error . However , perhaps the artist may have been commanded to model the statue thus ; and if not , his mistake is more than counter @-@ balanced by the beautiful turns of the muscles , the excellence of the features , and the true folds of the drapery . 
 James II 's statue has stood in several locations since it was first erected . It originally stood in the Palace of Whitehall 's Pebble Court , where it was installed on New Year 's Day , 1686 . It was situated behind the Banqueting House and faced the river , a position which attracted much satirical comment after James ' flight from London during the Glorious Revolution of 1688 ; it was said that the statue 's location indicated his method of escape . 
 It was taken down after the Glorious Revolution but was replaced by order of William III . In 1898 it was moved to a location in the garden of <unk> House but was taken down four years later to make room for the stands for the coronation of Edward VII . It lay on its back amid grass and weeds in a state of total neglect until it was re @-@ erected in 1903 outside the New Admiralty building , but was displaced again when the Admiralty Citadel was built in 1940 . During the Second World War it was put into storage at Aldwych tube station . It was relocated to its present site in 1947 . The statue is listed by Historic England as a Grade I listed building , a status which it was granted in 1970 . 
 = Bumblebee = 
 A bumblebee , also written bumble bee , is a member of the bee genus Bombus , in the family Apidae . The brood parasitic or cuckoo bumblebees have sometimes been classified as a subgenus or genus , Psithyrus , but are now usually treated as members of Bombus . This genus is the only extant group in the tribe Bombini , though a few extinct related genera ( e.g. , <unk> ) are known from fossils . Over 250 species of bumblebee are known . They are found primarily in higher altitudes or latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere , although they are also found in South America where a few lowland tropical species have been identified . European bumblebees have also been introduced to New Zealand and Tasmania . 
 Bumblebees are social insects which form colonies with a single queen . Colonies are smaller than those of honeybees , growing to as few as 50 individuals in a nest . Female bumblebees can sting repeatedly , but generally ignore humans and other animals . Cuckoo bumblebees do not make nests ; their queens aggressively invade the nests of other bumblebee species , kill the resident queens and then lay their own eggs which are cared for by the resident workers . 
 Bumblebees have round bodies covered in soft hair ( long , branched setae ) , called pile , making them appear and feel fuzzy . They have aposematic ( warning ) coloration , often consisting of contrasting bands of colour , and different species of bumblebee in a region often resemble each other in mutually protective Müllerian mimicry . Harmless insects such as hoverflies often derive protection from resembling bumblebees , in Batesian mimicry , and may be confused with them . Nest @-@ making bumblebees can be distinguished from similarly large , fuzzy cuckoo bees by the form of the female hind leg . In nesting bumblebees , it is modified to form a pollen basket , a bare shiny area surrounded by a fringe of hairs used to transport pollen , whereas in cuckoo bees , the hind leg is hairy all round , and pollen grains are wedged among the hairs for transport . 
 Like their relatives the honeybees , bumblebees feed on nectar , using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid ; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight . Bumblebees gather nectar to add to the stores in the nest , and pollen to feed their young . They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from . Some bumblebees rob nectar , making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer . Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators , so their decline in Europe , North America , and Asia is a cause for concern . The decline has been caused by habitat loss , the mechanisation of agriculture , and pesticides . 
 = = Etymology and common names = = 
 The word " bumblebee " is a compound of " bumble " + " bee " — " bumble " meaning to hum , buzz , drone , or move ineptly or <unk> . The generic name Bombus , assigned by Pierre André Latreille in 1802 , is derived from the Latin word for a buzzing or humming sound . 
 According to the Oxford English Dictionary ( OED ) , the term " bumblebee " was first recorded as having been used in the English language in the 1530 work <unk> by John <unk> , " I <unk> , as a <unk> bee <unk> . " However the OED also states that the term " <unk> " predates it , having first been used in 1450 in <unk> wyth Angle , " In <unk> the <unk> & the <unk> in the <unk> . " The latter term was used in A Midsummer Night 's Dream ( circa 1600 ) by William Shakespeare , " The <unk> @-@ bags <unk> from the humble Bees . " An old provincial name , " <unk> " , also denoted a buzzing insect such as a bumblebee or <unk> , " <unk> " probably imitating the sound of these insects , while " dor " meant " beetle " . In On the Origin of Species ( 1859 ) , Charles Darwin speculated about " humble @-@ bees " and their interactions with other species : 
 I have [ ... ] reason to believe that humble @-@ bees are indispensable to the fertilisation of the <unk> ( Viola tricolor ) , for other bees do not visit this flower . From experiments which I have tried , I have found that the visits of bees , if not indispensable , are at least highly beneficial to the fertilisation of our clovers ; but humble @-@ bees alone visit the common red clover ( Trifolium <unk> ) , as other bees cannot reach the nectar . 
 However , " bumblebee " remained in use , for example in The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse ( 1910 ) by Beatrix Potter , " Suddenly round a corner , she met Babbitty <unk> " Zizz , Bizz , <unk> ! " said the bumble bee . " Since World War II " <unk> " has fallen into near @-@ total disuse . 
 = = Phylogeny = = 
 The bumblebee tribe Bombini is one of four groups of corbiculate bees ( those with pollen baskets ) in the Apidae , the others being the Apini ( honeybees ) , <unk> ( orchid bees ) , and Meliponini ( stingless bees ) . The corbiculate bees are a monophyletic group . Advanced eusocial behaviour appears to have evolved twice in the group , giving rise to controversy , now largely settled , as to the phylogenetic origins of the four tribes ; it had been supposed that eusocial behaviour had evolved only once , requiring the Apini to be close to the Meliponini , which they do not resemble . It is now thought that the Apini ( with advanced societies ) and <unk> are closely related , while the primitively eusocial Bombini are close to the Meliponini , which have somewhat more advanced eusocial behaviour . Sophie Cardinal and Bryan Danforth comment that " While remarkable , a hypothesis of dual origins of advanced eusociality is congruent with early studies on corbiculate morphology and social behavior . " Their analysis , combining molecular , morphological and behavioural data , gives the following cladogram : 
 On this hypothesis , the molecular data suggest that the Bombini are 25 to 40 million years old , while the Meliponini ( and thus the clade that includes the Bombini and Meliponini ) are 81 to 96 million years old , about the same age as the corbiculate group . 
 The fossil record for bees is very incomplete , but by 2012 some 11 specimens that might possibly be Bombini , some poorly documented , had been described ; some ( such as <unk> <unk> from Florissant , USA , and <unk> <unk> from <unk> , Turkey ) dated from the Oligocene . In 2012 a fossil bumblebee , Bombus ( Bombus ) <unk> was found in the Miocene rocks of the <unk> Maar in southwestern Germany and confidently placed in the subgenus Bombus . In 2014 , a new bumblebee , Bombus <unk> , was described from Late Miocene lacustrine beds of La <unk> , Spain , while another , <unk> cuspidatus was described from the late Eocene Bembridge <unk> of the Isle of Wight . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The genus Bombus , the only one extant in the tribe Bombini , comprises over 250 species ; for an overview of the differences between bumblebees and other bees and wasps , see characteristics of common wasps and bees . The genus has been divided variously into up to 49 subgenera , a degree of complexity criticised by Williams ( 2008 ) . The cuckoo bumblebees Psithyrus have sometimes been treated as a separate genus but are now considered to be part of Bombus , in one or more subgenera . Williams identifies 15 subgenera that are seen to be monophyletic , fewer in number , diagnosable from morphology , and at least roughly correspond to behavioural and ecological groupings : Examples of Bombus species include Bombus atratus , Bombus <unk> , Bombus <unk> , Bombus <unk> , Bombus <unk> , and Bombus rupestris . 
 = = General description = = 
 Bumblebees are varied in appearance , but are generally plump and densely furry . Compared to honeybees they are larger and stouter @-@ bodied . Many species have broad bands of colour , the patterns helping to distinguish different species . Whereas honeybees have short tongues and therefore mainly pollinate open flowers , some bumblebee species have long tongues and collect nectar from flowers that are closed into a tube . Compared to a honeybee , a bumblebee has a broader body and a more rounded tip to the abdomen . Bumblebees have fewer stripes ( or none ) , and usually have part of the body covered in black fur , while honeybees have many stripes including several grey stripes on the abdomen . Sizes are very variable even within species ; the largest British species , B. terrestris , has queens up to 22 mm long , males up to 16 mm long , and workers between 11 and 17 mm long . The largest bumblebee species in the world is B. <unk> of Chile , up to about 40 mm long , and described as " flying mice " and " a monstrous fluffy ginger beast " . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Bumblebees are typically found in temperate climates , and are often found at higher latitudes and altitudes than other bees , although a few lowland tropical species exist . A few species ( B. <unk> and B. alpinus ) range into very cold climates where other bees might not be found ; B. <unk> occurs in northern Ellesmere Island in the high Arctic , along with another bumblebee B. hyperboreus , which parasitises its nest . This is the most northernmost occurrence of any eusocial insect . One reason for their presence in cold places is that bumblebees can regulate their body temperature , via solar radiation , internal mechanisms of " shivering " and radiative cooling from the abdomen ( called <unk> ) . Other bees have similar physiology , but the mechanisms seem best developed and have been most studied in bumblebees . They adapt to higher elevations by extending their wing stroke amplitude . Bumblebees have a largely cosmopolitan distribution but are absent from Australia ( apart from Tasmania where they have been introduced ) and are found in Africa only north of the Sahara . 
 = = Biology = = 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The bumblebee tongue ( the proboscis ) is a long , hairy structure that extends from a sheath @-@ like modified maxilla . The primary action of the tongue is lapping , that is , repeated dipping of the tongue into liquid . The tip of the tongue probably acts as a suction cup and during lapping , nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action . When at rest or flying , the proboscis is kept folded under the head . The longer the tongue , the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best @-@ suited to their tongue length . Bees with shorter <unk> , like Bombus <unk> , have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer <unk> ; to overcome this disadvantage , B. <unk> workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct , which resulted in a small reward . 
 = = = Wax production = = = 
 The exoskeleton of the abdomen is divided into plates called dorsal tergites and ventral sternites . Wax is secreted from glands on the abdomen and extruded between the sternites where it resembles flakes of dandruff . It is secreted by the queen when she starts a nest and by young workers . It is scraped from the abdomen by the legs , moulded until malleable and used in the construction of honeypots , to cover the eggs , to line empty cocoons for use as storage containers and sometimes to cover the exterior of the nest . 
 = = = Coloration = = = 
 The brightly coloured pile of the bumblebee is an aposematic ( warning ) signal , given that females can inflict a painful sting . Depending on the species and morph , the warning colours range from entirely black , to bright yellow , red , orange , white , and pink . <unk> flies in the families <unk> ( hoverflies ) , <unk> ( robber flies ) , Tabanidae ( horseflies ) , <unk> ( bot or warble flies ) and Bombyliidae ( bee flies ) all include Batesian mimics of bumblebees , resembling them closely enough to deceive at least some predators . 
 Many species of Bombus , including the group sometimes called Psithyrus ( cuckoo bumblebees ) , have evolved Müllerian mimicry , where the different bumblebees in a region resemble each other , so that a young predator need only learn to avoid any of them once . For example , in California a group of bumblebees consists of largely black species including B. californicus , B. <unk> , B. <unk> , B. <unk> , B. insularis and B. <unk> . Other bees in California include a group of species all banded black and yellow . In each case , Müllerian mimicry provides the bees in the group with a selective advantage . In addition , parasitic ( cuckoo ) bumblebees resemble their hosts more closely than would be expected by chance , at least in areas like Europe where parasite @-@ host co @-@ speciation is common ; but this too may be explained as Müllerian mimicry , rather than requiring the parasite 's coloration to deceive the host ( aggressive mimicry ) . 
 = = = Temperature control = = = 
 Bumblebees are active in conditions when honeybees stay at home , and can readily absorb heat from even weak sunshine . The thick pile created by long setae ( bristles ) acts as insulation to keep bumblebees warm in cold weather ; species from cold climates have longer setae ( and thus thicker insulation ) than those from the tropics . The temperature of the flight muscles , which occupy much of the thorax , needs to be at least 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) before flight can take place . The muscle temperature can be raised by shivering . It takes about five minutes for the muscles to reach this temperature at an air temperature of 13 ° C ( 55 ° F ) . 
 = = = = Chill @-@ coma temperature = = = = 
 The chill @-@ coma temperature in relation to flying insects is the temperature at which flight muscles cannot be activated . Compared to honey bees and carpenter bees , bumblebees have the lowest chill @-@ coma temperature . Of the bumblebees Bombus <unk> has the lowest at 7 ° C ( 45 ° F ) . However , bumblebees have been seen to fly in colder ambient temperatures . This discrepancy is likely because the chill @-@ coma temperature was determined by tests done in a laboratory setting . However , bumblebees live in insulated shelters and can shiver to warm up before venturing into the cold . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 Bumblebees do not have ears , and it is not known whether or how well they can hear . However , they are sensitive to the vibrations made by sound travelling through wood or other materials . 
 Bumblebees do not exhibit the " bee dances " used by honeybees to tell other workers the locations of food sources . Instead , when they return from a successful foraging expedition , they run excitedly around in the nest for several minutes before going out to forage once more . These bees may be offering some form of communication based on the buzzing sounds made by their wings , which may stimulate other bees to start foraging . Another stimulant to foraging activity is the level of food reserves in the colony . Bees monitor the amount of honey in the honeypots , and when little is left or when high quality food is added , they are more likely to go out to forage . 
 = = = Reproduction and nesting = = = 
 Bumblebees form colonies of between roughly 50 and 400 individuals ; these are small compared to honeybee hives , which hold about 50 @,@ 000 bees . Many species nest underground , choosing old rodent burrows or sheltered places , and avoiding places that receive direct sunlight that could result in overheating . Other species make nests above ground , whether in thick grass or in holes in trees . A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee ; the cells are instead clustered together <unk> . The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance , helping to prevent disease . Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter . 
 In the early spring , the queen comes out of diapause and finds a suitable place to create her colony . Then she builds wax cells in which to lay her eggs which were fertilised the previous year . The eggs that hatch develop into female workers , and in time , the queen populates the colony , with workers feeding the young and performing other duties similar to honeybee workers . In temperate zones , young queens ( gynes ) leave the nest in the autumn and mate , often more than once , with males ( drones ) that are forcibly driven out of the colony . The drones and workers die as the weather turns colder ; the young queens feed intensively to build up stores of fat for the winter . They survive in a resting state ( diapause ) , generally below ground , until the weather warms up in the spring with the early bumblebee being the species that is among the first to emerge . Many species of bumblebee follow this general trend within the year . Bombus <unk> is a species that follows this type of colony cycle . For this species the cycle begins in February , reproduction starts in July or August , and ends in the winter months . The queen remains in hibernation until spring of the following year in order to optimize conditions to search for a nest . 
 In fertilised queens , the ovaries only become active when the queen starts to lay . An egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina where there is a chamber called the spermatheca , in which the sperm from the mating is stored . Depending on need , she may allow her egg to be fertilised . <unk> eggs become haploid males ; fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens . The hormones that stimulate the development of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees , while the queen remains dominant . 
 To develop , the larvae must be fed both nectar for carbohydrates and pollen for protein . Bumblebees feed nectar to the larvae by chewing a small hole in the brood cell into which they regurgitate nectar . Larvae are fed pollen in one of two ways , depending on the bumblebee species . Pocket @-@ making bumblebees create pockets of pollen at the base of the brood @-@ cell clump from which the larvae feed themselves . Pollen @-@ storing bumblebees keep pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to the larvae . 
 After the emergence of the first or second group of offspring , workers take over the task of foraging and the queen spends most of her time laying eggs and caring for larvae . The colony grows progressively larger and eventually begins to produce males and new queens . Unlike the workers of more advanced social insects such as honeybees , bumblebee workers are fertile , and can lay unfertilised haploid eggs ( with only a single set of chromosomes ) that develop into viable male bumblebees . Only fertilised queens can lay diploid eggs ( one set of chromosomes from a drone , one from the queen ) that mature into workers and new queens . 
 In a young colony , the queen minimises reproductive competition from workers by suppressing their egg @-@ laying through physical aggression and pheromones . Worker policing leads to nearly all eggs laid by workers being eaten . Thus , the queen is usually the mother of all of the first males laid . Workers eventually begin to lay male eggs later in the season when the queen 's ability to suppress their reproduction diminishes . Because of the reproductive competition between workers and the queen , bumblebees are considered " primitively eusocial " . 
 Although a large majority of bumblebees follow such monogynous colony cycles that only involve one queen , some select Bombus species ( such as Bombus atratus ) will spend part of their life cycle in a polygynous phase ( have multiple queens in one nest during these periods of polygyny ) . 
 = = = Foraging behaviour = = = 
 Bumblebees generally visit flowers that exhibit the bee pollination syndrome and these patches of flowers may be up to 1 – 2 km from their colony . They tend to visit the same patches of flowers every day , as long as they continue to find nectar and pollen there , a habit known as pollinator or flower constancy . While foraging , bumblebees can reach ground speeds of up to 15 metres per second ( 54 km / h ) . 
 Bumblebees use a combination of colour and spatial relationships to learn from which flowers to forage . They can also detect both the presence and the pattern of electric fields on flowers , which occur due to atmospheric electricity , and take a while to leak away into the ground . They use this information to find out if a flower has been recently visited by another bee . After arriving at a flower , they extract nectar using their long tongues ( " <unk> " ) and store it in their crops . Many species of bumblebees also exhibit " nectar robbing " : instead of inserting the mouthparts into the flower in the normal way , these bees bite directly through the base of the corolla to extract nectar , avoiding pollen transfer . 
 Pollen is removed from flowers deliberately or incidentally by bumblebees . Incidental removal occurs when bumblebees come in contact with the anthers of a flower while collecting nectar . When it enters a flower , the bumblebee 's body hairs receive a dusting of pollen from the anthers . In queens and workers this is then groomed into the <unk> ( pollen baskets ) on the hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million pollen grains . Male bumblebees do not have <unk> and do not <unk> collect pollen . Bumblebees are also capable of buzz pollination , in which they dislodge pollen from the anthers by creating a resonant vibration with their flight muscles . 
 In at least some species , once a bumblebee has visited a flower , it leaves a scent mark on it . This scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the scent degrades . This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations ( e.g. nest , neutral , and food sites ) , and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers . Bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time , that is , where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the flower . 
 Once they have collected nectar and pollen , female workers return to the nest and deposit the harvest into brood cells , or into wax cells for storage . Unlike honeybees , bumblebees only store a few days ' worth of food , so are much more vulnerable to food shortages . Male bumblebees collect only nectar and do so to feed themselves . They may visit quite different flowers from the workers because of their different nutritional needs . 
 = = = Asynchronous flight muscles = = = 
 Bees beat their wings about 200 times a second . Their thorax muscles do not contract on each nerve firing , but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band . This is efficient , since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency , leading to low energy consumption . Further , it is necessary , since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second . These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and are found in the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera , Diptera , Coleoptera , and Hemiptera . Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures . Bumblebees have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) using this method . 
 = = = Cuckoo bumblebees = = = 
 Bumblebees of the subgenus Psithyrus ( known as ' cuckoo bumblebees ' , and formerly considered a separate genus ) are brood parasites , sometimes called kleptoparasites , in the colonies of other bumblebees , and have lost the ability to collect pollen . Before finding and invading a host colony , a Psithyrus female , such as that of the Psithyrus species of B. sylvestris , feeds directly from flowers . Once she has infiltrated a host colony , the Psithyrus female kills or subdues the queen of that colony , and uses pheromones and physical attacks to force the workers of that colony to feed her and her young . Usually , cuckoo bumblebees can be described as queen @-@ intolerant inquilines , since the host queen is often killed to enable the parasite to produce more offspring , though some species , such as B. <unk> , actually enjoy increased success when they leave the host queen alive . 
 The female Psithyrus has a number of morphological adaptations for combat , such as larger mandibles , a tough cuticle and a larger venom sac that increase her chances of taking over a nest . Upon emerging from their cocoons , the Psithyrus males and females disperse and mate . The males do not survive the winter but , like <unk> bumblebee queens , Psithyrus females find suitable locations to spend the winter and enter diapause after mating . They usually emerge from hibernation later than their host species . Each species of cuckoo bee has a specific host species , which it may physically resemble . In the case of the parasitism of B. terrestris by B. ( Psithyrus ) <unk> , genetic analysis of individuals captured in the wild showed that about 42 % of the host species ' nests at a single location had " [ lost ] their fight against their parasite " . 
 = = = Sting = = = 
 Queen and worker bumblebees can sting . Unlike in honeybees , a bumblebee 's stinger lacks barbs , so the bee can sting repeatedly without injuring itself ; by the same token , the stinger is not left in the wound . Bumblebee species are not normally aggressive , but may sting in defence of their nest , or if harmed . Female cuckoo bumblebees aggressively attack host colony members , and sting the host queen , but ignore other animals unless disturbed . 
 = = Predators , parasites and pathogens = = 
 Bumblebees , despite their ability to sting , are eaten by certain predators . Nests may be dug up by badgers and eaten whole , including any adults present . Adults are preyed upon by robber flies and <unk> in North America . In Europe , birds including bee @-@ eaters and shrikes capture adult bumblebees on the wing ; smaller birds such as great tits also occasionally learn to take bumblebees , while camouflaged crab spiders catch them as they visit flowers . 
 The great grey shrike is able to detect flying bumblebees up to 100 metres away ; once captured , the sting is removed by repeatedly squeezing the insect with the mandibles and wiping the abdomen on a branch . The European honey buzzard follows flying bees back to their nest , digs out the nest with their feet , and eats larvae , pupae and adults as they find them . 
 Bumblebees are parasitised by tracheal mites , <unk> <unk> ; protozoans including <unk> bombi and <unk> bombi ; and microsporidians including Nosema bombi and Nosema ceranae . The tree bumblebee B. <unk> has spread into the United Kingdom despite hosting high levels of a nematode that normally interferes with queen bees ' attempts to establish colonies . <unk> wing virus has been found to affect 11 % of bumblebees in Great Britain . 
 = = Relationship to humans = = 
 = = = Agricultural use = = = 
 Bumblebees are important pollinators of both crops and wildflowers . Because bumblebees do not overwinter the entire colony , they do not stockpile honey , so are not useful as honey producers . Bumblebees are increasingly cultured for agricultural use as pollinators , among other reasons because they can pollinate plants such as tomato in greenhouses by buzz pollination whereas other pollinators cannot . Commercial production began in 1987 , when Roland De <unk> founded the <unk> company ; in 1988 they produced enough nests to pollinate 40 hectares of tomatoes . The industry grew quickly , starting with other companies in the Netherlands . Bumblebee nests , mainly of buff @-@ tailed bumblebees , are produced in at least 30 factories around the world ; over a million nests are grown annually in Europe ; Turkey is a major producer . 
 Bumblebees are Northern Hemisphere animals . When red clover was introduced as a crop to New Zealand in the nineteenth century , it was found to have no local pollinators , and clover seed had accordingly to be imported each year . Four species of bumblebee from the United Kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators . In 1885 and 1886 the Canterbury Acclimatization Society brought in 442 queens , of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied . As planned , red clover was soon being produced from locally @-@ grown seed . Bumblebees are also reared commercially to pollinate tomatoes grown in greenhouses . The New Zealand population of buff @-@ tailed bumblebees naturally colonised Tasmania , 1 @,@ 500 miles away , in 1992 . 
 Some concerns exist about the impact of the international trade in mass @-@ produced bumblebee colonies . Evidence from Japan and South America indicates bumblebees can escape and naturalise in new environments , causing damage to native pollinators . Greater use of native pollinators , such as Bombus <unk> in China and Japan , has occurred as a result . In addition , mounting evidence indicates mass @-@ produced bumblebees may also carry diseases , harmful to wild bumblebees and honeybees . 
 = = = Population decline = = = 
 Bumblebee species are declining in Europe , North America , and Asia due to a number of factors , including land @-@ use change that reduces their food plants . In North America , pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus Bombus . A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture , accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War . Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts . The horses were fed on clover and hay , both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm . Little artificial fertiliser was used . Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower @-@ rich meadows , favouring bumblebees . Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover ; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses , outcompeting the meadow flowers . Most of the flowers , and the bumblebees that fed on them , disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s . The last native British short @-@ haired bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988 . This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the Bombus <unk> bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways : by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide , or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers . The species Bombus <unk> in particular has been found to be impacted by the pesticides ; their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected . Additionally , pesticide risk pose consequences colony development and size . 
 Bumblebees are in danger in many developed countries due to habitat destruction and collateral pesticide damage . The European Food Safety Authority ruled that three neonicotinoid pesticides ( clothianidin , imidacloprid , and thiamethoxam ) presented a high risk for bees . While most work on neonicotinoid toxicity has looked at honeybees , a study on B. terrestris showed that " field @-@ realistic " levels of imidacloprid significantly reduced growth rate and cut production of new queens by 85 % , implying a " considerable negative effect " on wild bumblebee populations throughout the developed world . Low levels of neonicotinoids can reduce the number of bumblebees in a colony by as much as 55 % , and cause dysfunction in the bumblebees ' brains . The Bumblebee Conservation Trust considers this evidence of reduced brain function " particularly alarming given that bumblebees rely upon their intelligence to go about their daily tasks . " A study on B. terrestris had results that suggests that use of neonicotinoid pesticides can affect how well bumblebees are able to forage and pollinate . Bee colonies that had been affected by the pesticide released more foragers and collected more pollen than bees who had not been dosed with neonicotinoid . Although the bees affected by the pesticide were able to collect more pollen , they took a longer amount of time doing so . 
 Of 19 species of native <unk> bumblebees and six species of cuckoo bumblebees formerly widespread in Britain , three have been extirpated , eight are in serious decline , and only six remain widespread . Similar declines have been reported in Ireland , with four species designated endangered , and another two considered vulnerable to extinction . A decline in bumblebee numbers could cause large @-@ scale changes to the countryside , resulting from inadequate pollination of certain plants . 
 Some bumblebees native to North America are also vanishing , such as Bombus <unk> , Bombus affinis , and Bombus occidentalis , and one , Bombus <unk> , may be extinct . In South America , Bombus bellicosus was extirpated in the Northern Limit of its distribution range , probably due to intense land use and climate change effects . 
 = = = Conservation efforts = = = 
 In 2006 the bumblebee researcher Dave Goulson founded a registered charity , the Bumblebee Conservation Trust , to prevent the extinction " of any of the UK 's bumblebees . " In 2009 and 2010 , the Trust attempted to reintroduce the short @-@ haired bumblebee , Bombus subterraneus , which had become extinct in Britain , from the British @-@ derived populations surviving in New Zealand from their introduction there a century earlier . From 2011 the Trust , in partnership with Natural England , Hymettus and the RSPB , has reintroduced short @-@ haired bumblebee queens from Skåne in southern Sweden to restored flower @-@ rich meadows at Dungeness in Kent . The queens were checked for mites and American <unk> disease . Agri @-@ environment schemes spread across the neighbouring area of Romney Marsh have been set up to provide over 800 hectares of additional flower @-@ rich habitat for the bees . By the summer of 2013 , workers of the species were found near the release zone , proving that nests had been established . The restored habitat has produced a revival in at least five " Schedule 41 priority " species : the ruderal bumblebee , Bombus <unk> ; the red @-@ <unk> carder bee , Bombus <unk> ; the shrill carder bee , Bombus sylvarum ; the brown @-@ banded carder bee , Bombus humilis and the moss carder bee , Bombus muscorum . 
 The world 's first bumblebee sanctuary was established at Vane Farm in the Loch Leven National Nature Reserve in Scotland in 2008 . 
 In 2011 , London 's Natural History Museum led the establishment of an International Union for the Conservation of Nature Bumblebee Specialist Group , chaired by Dr. Paul H. Williams , to assess the threat status of bumblebee species worldwide using Red List criteria .

 According to 20th @-@ century folklore , the laws of aerodynamics prove the bumblebee should be incapable of flight , as it does not have the capacity ( in terms of wing size or beats per second ) to achieve flight with the degree of wing loading necessary . 
 Supposedly someone did a back of the envelope calculation , taking the weight of a bumblebee and its wing area into account , and worked out that if it only flies at a couple of metres per second , the wings wouldn 't produce enough lift to hold the bee up , ' explains Charlie Ellington , Professor of Animal Mechanics at Cambridge University . 
 The origin of this claim has been difficult to pin down with any certainty . John H. <unk> recounted an anecdote about an unnamed Swiss aerodynamicist at a dinner party who performed some rough calculations and concluded , presumably in jest , that according to the equations , bumblebees cannot fly . In later years , <unk> has backed away from this origin , suggesting there could be multiple sources , and the earliest he has found was a reference in the 1934 book Le Vol des Insectes by French entomologist Antoine Magnan ( 1881 – 1938 ) ; they had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found their flight was impossible , but " One shouldn 't be surprised that the results of the calculations don 't square with reality " . 
 The following passage appears in the introduction to Le Vol des Insectes : 
 Tout d <unk> <unk> par ce qui se fait en aviation , j 'ai appliqué aux insectes les lois de la résistance de l 'air , et je suis <unk> avec M. Sainte @-@ Laguë à cette conclusion que leur vol est impossible . 
 This translates to : 
 First prompted by what is done in aviation , I applied the laws of air resistance to insects , and I arrived , with Mr. Sainte @-@ Laguë , at this conclusion that their flight is impossible . 
 Magnan refers to his assistant André Sainte @-@ Laguë . Some credit physicist Ludwig Prandtl ( 1875 – 1953 ) of the University of Göttingen in Germany with popularizing the idea . Others say Swiss gas <unk> Jacob <unk> ( 1898 – 1981 ) did the calculations . 
 The calculations that purported to show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating <unk> . The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation . This ignores the effect of dynamic stall ( an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing ) , which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight . More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle . 
 Additionally , John Maynard Smith , a noted biologist with a strong background in aeronautics , has pointed out that bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight , as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area . However , in aerodynamics experiments with other insects , he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size , and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude . 
 = = = In music and literature = = = 
 The orchestral interlude Flight of the Bumblebee was composed ( c . 1900 ) by Nikolai Rimsky @-@ Korsakov . It represents the turning of Prince Guidon into a bumblebee so he can fly away to visit his father , Tsar Saltan , in the opera The Tale of Tsar Saltan , although the music may reflect the flight of a <unk> rather than a bumblebee . The music inspired Walt Disney to feature a bumblebee in his 1940 animated musical Fantasia and have it sound as if it were flying in all parts of the theater . This early attempt at " surround sound " was unsuccessful , and the music was excluded from the film 's release . 
 In 1599 , during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I , someone , possibly Tailboys <unk> , published Caltha Poetarum : Or The Bumble Bee , under the pseudonym " T. <unk> " . This was one of nine books censored under the Bishop 's Ban issued by the Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift and the Bishop of London Richard Bancroft . 
 Emily Dickinson made a bumblebee the subject of her parody of Isaac Watts 's well @-@ known poem about honeybees , How Doth the Little Busy Bee ( 1715 ) . Where Watts wrote " How skilfully she builds her cell ! How neat she spreads the wax ! " , Dickinson 's poem , " The Bumble @-@ Bee 's Religion " ( 1881 ) begins " His little Hearse @-@ like Figure / Unto itself a Dirge / To a delusive Lilac / The vanity divulge / Of Industry and Morals / And every righteous thing / For the divine Perdition / of Idleness and Spring . " The letter was said to have enclosed a dead bee . 
 The entomologist Otto Plath wrote Bumblebees and Their Ways in 1934 . His daughter , the poet Sylvia Plath , wrote a group of poems about bees late in 1962 , within four months of her suicide , transforming her father 's interest into her poetry . 
 The scientist and illustrator Moses Harris ( 1731 – 1785 ) painted accurate watercolour drawings of bumblebees in his An Exposition of English Insects Including the Several Classes of Neuroptera , Hymenoptera , & Diptera , or Bees , Flies , & <unk> ( 1776 – 80 ) . 
 Bumblebees appear as characters , often eponymously , in children 's books . The surname Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series ( 1997 – 2007 ) is an old name for bumblebee . J. K. Rowling said the name " seemed to suit the headmaster , because one of his passions is music and I imagined him walking around humming to himself " . Among the many books for younger children are Bumble the Bee by Yvon <unk> and Tony Neal ( 2014 ) ; Bertie Bumble Bee by K. I. Al @-@ Ghani ( 2012 ) ; Ben the Bumble Bee : How do bees make honey ? by <unk> <unk> ( 2015 ) ; Bumble Bee Bob Has a Big Butt by Papa Campbell ( 2012 ) ; Buzz , Buzz , Buzz ! Went Bumble @-@ bee by Colin West ( 1997 ) ; Bumble Bee by Margaret Wise Brown ( 2000 ) ; How the Bumble Came to Bee by Paul and Ella Quarry ( 2012 ) ; The Adventures of Professor Bumble and the Bumble Bees by Stephen <unk> ( 2010 ) . Among Beatrix Potter 's " little books " , <unk> Bumble and other members of her nest appear in The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse ( 1910 ) . 
 Bumblebee is the name of a prominent character in the Transformers franchise , his name denotes his Black @-@ on @-@ Yellow vehicle paint job , directly referencing the bee @-@ genus because of its black and yellow stripes . Bumblebee is also the name of an automotive Racing stripe that wraps around the grill instead of down the centre of the vehicle ; it can be found mainly on Chevrolet <unk> ( which happens to be the Transformers Autobot 's most popular vehicle mode ) . 
 = Enola Gay = 
 The Enola Gay ( pronunciation : / <unk> <unk> / ) is a Boeing B @-@ 29 Superfortress bomber , named for Enola Gay Tibbets , the mother of the pilot , Colonel Paul Tibbets , who selected the aircraft while it was still on the assembly line . On 6 August 1945 , during the final stages of World War II , it became the first aircraft to drop an atomic bomb . The bomb , code @-@ named " Little Boy " , was targeted at the city of Hiroshima , Japan , and caused unprecedented destruction . Enola Gay participated in the second atomic attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of Kokura . Clouds and drifting smoke resulted in a secondary target , Nagasaki , being bombed instead . 
 After the war , the Enola Gay returned to the United States , where it was operated from Roswell Army Air Field , New Mexico . It was flown to Kwajalein for the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in the Pacific , but was not chosen to make the test drop at Bikini Atoll . Later that year it was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution , and spent many years parked at air bases exposed to the weather and souvenir hunters , before being disassembled and transported to the Smithsonian 's storage facility at Suitland , Maryland , in 1961 . 
 In the 1980s , veterans groups engaged in a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display , leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context . The cockpit and nose section of the aircraft were exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum ( NASM ) in downtown Washington , D.C. , for the bombing 's 50th anniversary in 1995 , amid controversy . Since 2003 , the entire restored B @-@ 29 has been on display at NASM 's Steven F. Udvar @-@ Hazy Center . The last survivor of its crew , Theodore Van Kirk , died on July 28 , 2014 , at the age of 93 .

 The Enola Gay ( Model number B @-@ 29 @-@ 45 @-@ MO , Serial number 44 @-@ <unk> , Victor number 82 ) was built by the Glenn L. Martin Company ( now Lockheed Martin ) at its Bellevue , Nebraska plant , located at what is now known as Offutt Air Force Base . The bomber was one of 15 B @-@ 29s with the " Silverplate " modifications necessary to deliver atomic weapons . These modifications included an extensively modified bomb bay with pneumatic doors and British bomb attachment and release systems , reversible pitch propellers that gave more braking power on landing , improved engines with fuel injection and better cooling , and the removal of protective armor and gun turrets . 
 Enola Gay was personally selected by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets , Jr . , the commander of the 509th Composite Group , on 9 May 1945 , while still on the assembly line . The aircraft was accepted by the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) on 18 May 1945 and assigned to the 393d Bombardment Squadron , Heavy , 509th Composite Group . Crew B @-@ 9 , commanded by Captain Robert A. Lewis , took delivery of the bomber and flew it from Omaha to the 509th 's base at Wendover Army Air Field , Utah , on 14 June 1945 . 
 Thirteen days later , the aircraft left Wendover for Guam , where it received a bomb @-@ bay modification , and flew to North Field , Tinian , on 6 July . It was initially given the Victor ( squadron @-@ assigned identification ) number 12 , but on 1 August , was given the circle R tail markings of the 6th Bombardment Group as a security measure and had its Victor number changed to 82 to avoid misidentification with actual 6th Bombardment Group aircraft . During July , the bomber made eight practice or training flights , and flew two missions , on 24 and 26 July , to drop pumpkin bombs on industrial targets at Kobe and Nagoya . Enola Gay was used on 31 July on a rehearsal flight for the actual mission . 
 The partially assembled Little Boy gun @-@ type nuclear weapon L @-@ 11 was contained inside a 41 @-@ inch ( 100 cm ) x 47 @-@ inch ( 120 cm ) x 138 @-@ inch ( 350 cm ) wooden crate weighing 10 @,@ 000 pounds ( 4 @,@ 500 kg ) that was secured to the deck of the USS Indianapolis . Unlike the six Uranium @-@ 235 target discs , which were later flown to Tinian on three separate aircraft arriving 28 and 29 July , the assembled projectile with the nine Uranium @-@ 235 rings installed was shipped in a single lead @-@ lined steel container weighing 300 pounds ( 140 kg ) that was securely locked to brackets welded to the deck of Captain Charles B. McVay III 's quarters . Both the L @-@ 11 and projectile were dropped off at Tinian on 26 July 1945 . 
 = = = Hiroshima mission = = = 
 On 5 August 1945 , during preparation for the first atomic mission , Tibbets assumed command of the aircraft and named it after his mother , Enola Gay Tibbets , who had herself been named for the heroine of a novel . When it came to selecting a name for the plane , Tibbets later recalled that : 
 my thoughts turned at this point to my courageous red @-@ haired mother , whose quiet confidence had been a source of strength to me since boyhood , and particularly during the soul @-@ searching period when I decided to give up a medical career to become a military pilot . At a time when Dad had thought I had lost my marbles , she had taken my side and said , " I know you will be all right son . " 
 The name was painted on the aircraft on 5 August by Allan L. Karl , an enlisted man in the 509th . Regularly assigned aircraft commander Robert Lewis was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission , and became furious when he arrived at the aircraft on the morning of 6 August to see it painted with the now @-@ famous nose art . 
 Hiroshima was the primary target of the first nuclear bombing mission on 6 August , with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets . Enola Gay , piloted by Tibbets , took off from North Field , in the Mariana Islands , about six hours ' flight time from Japan , accompanied by two other B @-@ 29s , The Great Artiste , carrying instrumentation , and a then @-@ nameless aircraft later called Necessary Evil , commanded by Captain George Marquardt , to take photographs . The director of the Manhattan Project , Major General Leslie R. Groves , Jr . , wanted the event recorded for posterity , so the takeoff was illuminated by floodlights . When he wanted to taxi , Tibbets leaned out the window to direct the bystanders out of the way . On request , he gave a friendly wave for the cameras . 
 After leaving Tinian , the aircraft made their way separately to Iwo Jima , where they rendezvoused at 2 @,@ 440 meters ( 8 @,@ 010 ft ) and set course for Japan . The aircraft arrived over the target in clear visibility at 9 @,@ 855 meters ( 32 @,@ 333 ft ) . Captain William S. " Deak " Parsons of Project Alberta , who was in command of the mission , armed the bomb during the flight to minimize the risks during takeoff . His assistant , Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson , removed the safety devices 30 minutes before reaching the target area . 
 The release at 08 : 15 ( Hiroshima time ) went as planned , and the Little Boy took 43 seconds to fall from the aircraft flying at 31 @,@ 060 feet ( 9 @,@ 470 m ) to the predetermined detonation height about 1 @,@ 968 feet ( 600 m ) above the city . Enola Gay traveled 11 @.@ 5 mi ( 18 @.@ 5 km ) before it felt the shock waves from the blast . Although buffeted by the shock , neither Enola Gay nor The Great Artiste was damaged . 
 The detonation created a blast equivalent to 16 kilotons of TNT ( 67 TJ ) . The U @-@ 235 weapon was considered very inefficient , with only 1 @.@ 7 % of its fissile material fissioning . The radius of total destruction was about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) , with resulting fires across 4 @.@ 4 square miles ( 11 km2 ) . Americans estimated that 4 @.@ 7 square miles ( 12 km2 ) of the city were destroyed . Japanese officials determined that 69 % of Hiroshima 's buildings were destroyed and another 6 – 7 % damaged . Some 70 @,@ 000 – 80 @,@ 000 people , or some 30 % of the city 's population , were killed by the blast and resultant firestorm , and another 70 @,@ 000 injured . Out of those killed , 20 @,@ 000 were soldiers . 
 Enola Gay returned safely to its base on Tinian to great fanfare , touching down at 2 : 58 pm , after 12 hours 13 minutes . The Great Artiste and Necessary Evil followed at short intervals . Several hundred people , including journalists and photographers , had gathered to watch the planes return . Tibbets was the first to disembark , and was presented with the Distinguished Service Cross on the spot . 
 = = = Nagasaki mission = = = 
 The Hiroshima mission was followed by another atomic strike . Originally scheduled for 11 August , it was brought forward by two days to 9 August owing to bad weather . This time , a Fat Man nuclear weapon was carried by B @-@ 29 Bockscar , piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney . Enola Gay , flown by Captain George Marquardt 's Crew B @-@ 10 , was the weather reconnaissance aircraft for Kokura , the primary target . Enola Gay reported clear skies over Kokura , but by the time Bockscar arrived , the city was obscured by smoke from fires from the conventional bombing of Yawata by 224 B @-@ 29s the day before . After three unsuccessful passes , Bockscar diverted to its secondary target , Nagasaki , where it dropped its bomb . In contrast to the Hiroshima mission , the Nagasaki mission has been described as tactically botched , although the mission did meet its objectives . The crew encountered a number of problems in execution , and had very little fuel by the time they landed at the emergency backup landing site Yontan Airfield on Okinawa .

 On 6 November 1945 , Lewis flew the Enola Gay back to the United States , arriving at the 509th 's new base at Roswell Army Air Field , New Mexico , on 8 November . On 29 April 1946 , Enola Gay left Roswell as part of Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in the Pacific . It flew to Kwajalein on 1 May . It was not chosen to make the test drop at Bikini Atoll and left Kwajalein on 1 July , the date of the test , reaching Fairfield @-@ Suisun Army Air Field , California , the next day . 
 The decision was made to preserve the Enola Gay , and on 24 July 1946 , the aircraft was flown to Davis @-@ Monthan Air Force Base , Arizona , in preparation for storage . On 30 August 1946 , the title to the aircraft was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution and the Enola Gay was removed from the USAAF inventory . From 1946 to 1961 , the Enola Gay was put into temporary storage at a number of locations . It was at Davis @-@ Monthan from 1 September 1946 until 3 July 1949 , when it was flown to Orchard Place Air Field , Park Ridge , Illinois , by Tibbets for acceptance by the Smithsonian . It was moved to <unk> Air Force Base , Texas , on 12 January 1952 , and then to Andrews Air Force Base , Maryland , on 2 December 1953 , because the Smithsonian had no storage space for the aircraft . 
 It was hoped that the Air Force would guard the plane but , lacking hangar space , it was left outdoors on a remote part of the air base , exposed to the elements . Souvenir hunters broke in and removed parts . Insects and birds then gained access to the aircraft . Paul E. Garber , the first head of the National Air Museum of the Smithsonian Institution , became concerned about the Enola Gay 's condition , and on 10 August 1960 , Smithsonian staff began dismantling the aircraft . The components were transported to the Smithsonian storage facility at Suitland , Maryland , on 21 July 1961 . 
 Enola Gay remained at Suitland for many years . By the early 1980s , two veterans of the 509th , Don <unk> and his former navigator in the 509th , Frank B. Stewart , began lobbying for the aircraft to be restored and put on display . They enlisted Tibbets and Senator Barry Goldwater in their campaign . In 1983 , Walter Boyne , a former B @-@ 52 pilot with the Strategic Air Command , became director of the National Air and Space Museum , and he made the Enola Gay 's restoration a priority . Looking at the aircraft , Tibbets recalled , was a " sad meeting . [ My ] fond memories , and I don 't mean the dropping of the bomb , were the numerous occasions I flew the airplane .... I pushed it very , very hard and it never failed me .... It was probably the most beautiful piece of machinery that any pilot ever flew . " 
 Restoration of the bomber began on 5 December 1984 , at the Paul E. Garber Preservation , Restoration , and Storage Facility in Suitland @-@ Silver Hill , Maryland . The propellers that were used on the bombing mission were later shipped to Texas A & M University . One of these propellers was trimmed to 12 @.@ 5 feet ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) for use in the university 's Oran W. Nicks Low Speed Wind Tunnel . The lightweight aluminium variable @-@ pitch propeller is powered by a 1 @,@ 250 kVA electric motor providing a wind speed up to 200 miles per hour ( 320 km / h ) . Two engines were rebuilt at Garber and two at San Diego Air & Space Museum . The work was slow and meticulous . Every component was carefully cleaned . Some parts and instruments had been removed and could not be located . Replacements were found or fabricated , and marked so that future curators could distinguish them from the original components .

 = = = Exhibition controversy = = = 
 Enola Gay became the center of a controversy at the Smithsonian Institution when the museum planned to put its fuselage on public display in 1995 as part of an exhibit commemorating the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima . The exhibit , The Crossroads : The End of World War II , the Atomic Bomb and the Cold War , was drafted by the Smithsonian 's National Air and Space Museum staff , and arranged around the restored Enola Gay . 
 Critics of the planned exhibit , especially those of the American Legion and the Air Force Association , charged that the exhibit focused too much attention on the Japanese casualties inflicted by the nuclear bomb , rather than on the motivations for the bombing or the discussion of the bomb 's role in ending the conflict with Japan . The exhibit brought to national attention many long @-@ standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings . As a result , after various failed attempts to revise the exhibit in order to meet the satisfaction of competing interest groups , the exhibit was canceled on 30 January 1995 . Martin O. <unk> , Director of the National Air and Space Museum , was compelled to resign over the controversy . 
 The forward fuselage did go on display on 28 June 1995 . On 2 July 1995 , three people were arrested for throwing ash and human blood on the aircraft 's fuselage , following an earlier incident in which a protester had thrown red paint over the gallery 's carpeting . The exhibition closed on 18 May 1998 , and the fuselage was returned to the Garber Facility for final restoration .

 Restoration work began in 1984 , and would eventually require 300 @,@ 000 staff hours .

 = Hershey Creamery Company = 
 Hershey Creamery Company , also known as Hershey 's Ice Cream , is a creamery that produces Hershey 's brand ice cream , sorbet , sherbet , and frozen yogurt , and other frozen treats such as smoothies and frozen slab style ice cream mixers . Founded by Jacob Hershey and four of his brothers in 1894 ( all of whom have no relation to Milton S. Hershey and the chocolate company that he founded , also in 1894 ) , it was taken over by the Holder family in the 1920s . The company was one of the first to offer consumers pre @-@ packaged ice cream pints . In 1998 , it modernized its operations to increase efficiency and reduce overhead . With their shared names and cities of origin , Hershey Creamery and Hershey Company have had a tumultuous relationship marked by multiple lawsuits over trademark issues . In the mid @-@ 1990s , the companies settled their most recent legal battles out of court , with the creamery agreeing to add a disclaimer to its ice cream products to note that it is not affiliated with The Hershey Company . 
 The family @-@ owned business has approximately 450 employees and operates 22 distribution centers in 28 states across the Eastern and Northeastern United States . It is a publicly traded company , with its stocks listed only on Pink Sheets as the company offers a limited number of shares to potential shareholders . In 2001 , the company posted a profit of $ 4 @.@ 1 million with sales reaching $ 91 @.@ 4 million . 
 = = History = = 
 The Hershey brothers , Jacob , Isaac , John , Paris , and Eli , founded Hershey Creamery Company in 1894 , with the company originally operating out of the Hershey family 's Lancaster County farmhouse . The ice cream was packed in metal @-@ lined wooden containers that the Hershey brothers designed and built . The containers were loaded into trucks with ice packed around them to keep the ice cream fresh and cold . Salesmen traveled daily routes to deliver product to customers in the county and in surrounding areas . 
 In the 1920s , the company was merged with the Holder family 's Bethlehem @-@ based Meyer Dairy Company , retaining the Hershey name . In 1926 , with demand for the ice cream exceeding the capacity of the farmhouse , the newly merged company constructed its first ice cream plant in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania . During the Great Depression , the company became the first ice cream maker to offer its products in pre @-@ packaged pints . It began creating new flavors of ice cream which it then sold to other ice cream makers . Following World War II , the company continued to answer the call for greater convenience in consumer foods and expanded its offerings to include single @-@ serve , easy to eat items such as popsicles and ice cream sandwiches . In the 1960s , the Holder family assumed full ownership of the company . 
 As the company grew , it split its production operations , with the Harrisburg location mixing the ice cream and a new facility in Lower Swatara Township used for the actual hardening and packaging of the product . While local orders continued to be delivered in small Hershey 's Ice Cream refrigerated trucks , the company shifted to transporting most of its ice cream to refrigerated tractor trailer trucks , enabling it to stretch its market beyond the state of Pennsylvania . It expanded its distribution facilities , eventually occupying 22 co @-@ owned distribution centers . This enabled the company to ship products out more quickly after orders are received and resulted in less travel time for the products , ensuring freshness and quality were maintained . In the summer months , the company greatly increased its workforce and leased additional cold @-@ storage space to help meet the seasonal orders , as the orders were prepared by hand . In 1998 , operations were modernized and automated when the company purchased 105 acres ( 0 @.@ 42 km2 ) in nearby Middletown where it constructed a modern 1 @.@ 3 million cubic foot warehouse , enabling it to boost its efficiency , reducing the need to increase its summer workforce , and reducing the frequent product loss caused by hand orders and inefficient packing systems . The modernization of its warehouse also improved inventory management , order accuracy , and has helped the company continue its growth . 
 = = = Trademark disputes with Hershey Company = = = 
 Hershey Creamery has been involved in multiple legal disputes with the similarly named Hershey Company , founded around the same time in Lancaster by Milton S. Hershey — no relation to the founding Hershey brothers . The first troubles came after the Hershey Creamery began producing chocolate candy and cocoa . Milton S. Hershey learned of the candies in 1919 , and assigned Charles Ziegler to " find instances of confusion and infringement and of unfair competition " . Ziegler found that in addition to making similar products , the packaging used on the chocolates resembled that used by Hershey Company — then called Hershey Chocolate . Investigating complaints from retailers in Boston , New York , Binghamton , Norfolk , and Richmond , Ziegler reportedly found that retailers were confusing the two products , and sometimes deliberately replacing the higher priced Hershey Company products with the Hershey Creamery products . In Harrisburg , Ziegler found a display of Hershey Creamery " Hershey Kisses " , which were bite @-@ sized chocolate drops similar to the chocolate company 's creations . After cease and desist letters failed to resolve the problem , Milton Hershey filed suit in 1921 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania for trademark infringement . In 1926 , a district judged partially sided with Hershey Chocolate and prohibited the creamery from using the name Hershey 's in connection with " manufacture , advertisement , distribution , or sale of , among other things , chocolate , cocoa , chocolate confections , and chocolate or cocoa products " . 
 In 1958 , the creamery registered for and was granted the " Hershey 's " trademark for use with ice cream and butter products . Seven years later , the company filed suit in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Hershey Company and Consolidated Foods Corporation after learning the companies were planning to partner to make a line of Hershey 's branded ice cream bars . Hershey Creamery alleged " trademark infringement , unfair competition , false designation of origin , false descriptions , and false representations " , to which Hershey Chocolate responded with a counterclaim questioning the validity of the trademark , claiming it was fraudulently obtained . The companies settled out of court the following year , with the creamery agreeing to drop " butter " from its trademark and fix a filing error with it , and allowing Hershey Company to release the licensed bars within certain guidelines . Hershey Company also agreed not to challenge the creamery 's " Hershey 's " trademark for use on ice cream again . 
 Shortly after this , Hershey Creamery expanded its trademark to include other ice cream products : " ice cream , ice milk , sherbet , water ice , and frozen confections in which ice cream , ice milk , sherbet or water ice is a component " . In 1989 , the creamery expanded its products to include frozen yogurt and filed for a new trademark for this new line of products . Upon learning of the registration request , the Hershey Company — then named Hershey Foods — demanded the company cease production of the products claiming it violated Hershey Company 's trademarks . The creamery dropped its application , but continued releasing the products , so in May 1990 , Hershey Company filed suit in the Middle District court of Pennsylvania seeking a legal injunction to stop Hershey Creamery from producing and marketing its Hershey 's branded frozen yogurt , as well as to attempt to stop the company from using the " Hershey 's " trademark outside of its " traditional thirteen @-@ state trading area " and to demand that the company include a disclaimer disavowing its relation to Hershey Company on all of its products . Hershey Creamery counter sued in the New York South District court , concerned that Hershey Company demands reneged on the 1967 settlement , and requested the Pennsylvania court actions be transferred to the New York court as that was where the settlement was originally handled . The request was denied and the court instead blocked the Hershey Creamery 's suit in New York . The Creamery appealed but this was denied . 
 After three years in court , the two companies again settled , with Hershey Creamery agreeing to put a disclaimer on all of its products , corporate website , and in promotional materials and press releases . On their website , the disclaimer simply notes " not affiliated with Hershey 's Chocolate " .

 In November 2008 , Hershey Creamery Company became the first company in the nation to be prosecuted and fined for failing to implement a Risk Management Program ( RMP ) as required by the Clean Air Act . The charges were brought by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , which stated that the company failed to develop the required plans with regard to its storage and use of anhydrous ammonia , which is a regulated substance . In the charges , the EPA noted that the creamery twice certified that it had developed the RMP plan , once in 1999 and again in 2004 . Later inspection showed that the certifications were false and on December 7 , 2006 , the EPA issued a civil compliance order against the company , ordering the company to come into compliance . Hershey Creamery complied and in April 2007 submitted the appropriate <unk> , which were confirmed to be in @-@ place through subsequent inspection . The case was heard at the Federal Middle District court of Pennsylvania , with Hershey Creamery pleading guilty to the charges ; it was subsequently fined $ 100 @,@ 000 and given a year probation .

 Hershey Creamery is a family operated business , with each new generation raised to assume roles within the company hierarchy upon graduation of high school . As of 2009 , George Holder is its president , while his younger brothers , Walter and Tom , are vice president of manufacturing and vice president of sales and marketing , respectively . The company has approximately 450 employees . 
 The company operates 22 distribution centers , which serve some 22 @,@ 000 clients in 28 states across the eastern United States , with Florida , Illinois , and the Carolinas being its newest market areas after its 2005 expansion . Since 1996 , management has focused on the company 's main distribution center rather than expansion outside of existing footprint . In 2003 , it shifted its focus to moving its operations from the Harrisburg area , which is flood @-@ prone and landlocked , to the Lower Swatara area . It opened a distribution center there in 1998 , and plans to shift its headquarters and production facilities there over the next five to ten years . Unlike other ice cream makers , Hershey Creamery maintains ownership over its delivery trucks , distribution centers and warehouses , a practice the Holder family feels is important to maintaining the traditions of the " private , conservative " company . 
 Sales are primarily derived from branded ice cream parlors , quick @-@ serve restaurants , and the distribution of its pre @-@ packaged items to convenience stores , food service operators such as schools , hospitals , prisons , military installations , sports stadiums , amusement parks , and assisted living centers . Pre @-@ packaged items are also sold in regional supermarkets , but this accounts for a minority of the company 's sales .

 Hershey Creamery Company is a publicly traded company , with only 36 @,@ 000 shares available , which are listed on Pink Sheets ( OTC Pink : <unk> ) and sold via the over @-@ the @-@ counter market . The company has fewer than 500 shareholders , primarily among the Holder family . Its stocks are considered to be " thinly traded " in that its shares are rarely traded , and then only a few shares are sold at a time . In 2006 , the company maintained a 6 @.@ 2 to 1 price @-@ to @-@ earnings ratio with no long @-@ term debt and shareholders receive quarterly dividends and special dividends . 
 In 1936 , the company shares traded at $ 2 @.@ 01 per share .

 = Independence Day ( Pakistan ) = 
 Independence Day ( Urdu : <unk> <unk> ; <unk> @-@ e <unk> ) , observed annually on 14 August , is a national holiday in Pakistan . It commemorates the day when Pakistan achieved independence and was declared a sovereign nation following the end of the British Raj in 1947 . Pakistan came into existence as a result of the Pakistan Movement which aimed for the creation of an independent Muslim state by division of the north @-@ western regions of South Asia . The movement was led by the All @-@ India Muslim League under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah . The event was brought forth by the Indian Independence Act 1947 under which the British Raj gave independence to the Dominion of Pakistan ( later the Islamic Republic of Pakistan ) which comprised West Pakistan ( present @-@ day Pakistan ) and East Pakistan ( now Bangladesh ) . In the Islamic calendar , the day of independence coincided with Ramadan 27 , the eve of which , being <unk> al @-@ <unk> , is regarded as sacred by Muslims . 
 The main Independence Day ceremony takes place in Islamabad , where the national flag is hoisted at the Presidential and Parliament buildings . It is followed by the national anthem and live televised speeches by leaders . Usual celebratory events and festivities for the day include flag @-@ raising ceremonies , parades , cultural events , and the playing of patriotic songs . A number of award ceremonies are often held on this day , and citizens often hoist the national flag atop their homes or display it prominently on their vehicles and attire . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 The area constituting Pakistan was historically a part of the British Indian Empire throughout much of the nineteenth century . The East India Company begun their trade in South Asia in the 17th century , and the company rule started from 1757 when they won the Battle of Plassey . Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Government of India Act 1858 led to the British Crown assuming direct control over much of the Indian subcontinent . All @-@ India Muslim League was founded by the All India <unk> Educational Conference at Dhaka , in 1906 , in the context of the circumstances that were generated over the division of Bengal in 1905 and the party aimed at creation of a separate Muslim state . 
 The period after World War I was marked by British reforms such as the Montagu – Chelmsford Reforms , but it also witnessed the enactment of the repressive Rowlatt Act and strident calls for self @-@ rule by Indian activists . The widespread discontent of this period crystallized into nationwide non @-@ violent movements of non @-@ cooperation and civil disobedience . The idea for a separate religion @-@ based state was introduced by Allama Iqbal in his speech as the President of the Muslim League in December 1930 . Three years later , the name " Pakistan " as the name of a separate state was proposed in a declaration made by Choudhary Rahmat Ali . Like Iqbal , Bengal was left out of the proposal made by Rahmat Ali . 
 In the 1940s , as the Indian independence movement intensified , an upsurge of Muslim nationalism helmed by the All @-@ India Muslim League took place , of which Muhammad Ali Jinnah was the most prominent leader . Being a political party to secure the interests of the Muslim diaspora in British India , the Muslim League played a decisive role during the 1940s in the Indian independence movement and developed into the driving force behind the creation of Pakistan as a Muslim state in the South Asia . During a three @-@ day general session of All @-@ India Muslim League from 22 – 24 March 1940 , a formal political statement was presented , known as the Lahore Resolution , which called on for the creation of an independent state for Muslims . 
 = = = Independence = = = 
 In 1946 , the Labour government in Britain , exhausted by recent events such as World War II and numerous riots , realized that it had neither the mandate at home , the support internationally , nor the reliability of the British Indian Army for continuing to control an increasingly restless British India . The reliability of the native forces for continuing their control over an increasingly rebellious India diminished , and so the government decided to end the British rule of the Indian Subcontinent . In 1946 , the Indian National Congress , being a secular party , demanded a single state . The Muslim majorities , who disagreed with the idea of single state , stressed the idea of a separate Pakistan as an alternative . The 1946 Cabinet Mission to India was sent to try and reach a compromise between Congress and the Muslim League , proposing a decentralized state with much power given to local governments , but it was rejected by both of the parties and resulted in a number of riots in South Asia . 
 Eventually , in February 1947 , Prime Minister Clement Attlee announced that the British government would grant full self @-@ governance to British India by June 1948 at the latest . On 3 June 1947 , the British government announced that the principle of division of British India into two independent states was accepted . The successor governments would be given dominion status and would have an implicit right to secede from the British Commonwealth . Viceroy Mountbatten chose the second anniversary of Japan 's surrender in the World War II as the date of power transfer . He chose 14 August as the date of the ceremony of power transfer to Pakistan because he wanted to attend the ceremonies in both India and Pakistan . 
 The Indian Independence Act 1947 ( 10 & 11 Geo 6 c . 30 ) passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom divided British India into the two new independent dominions ; the Dominion of India ( later to become the Republic of India ) and the Dominion of Pakistan ( later to become the Islamic Republic of Pakistan ) . The act provided a mechanism for division of the Bengal and Punjab provinces between the two nations ( see partition of India ) , establishment of the office of the Governor @-@ General , conferral of complete legislative authority upon the respective Constituent Assemblies , and division of joint property between the two new countries . On 14 August 1947 , the new Dominion of Pakistan became independent and Muhammad Ali Jinnah was sworn in as its first governor general in Karachi . Independence was marked with widespread celebration , but the atmosphere remained heated as communal riots marked the independence of Pakistan in 1947 . The act later received royal assent on 18 July 1947 . 
 = = = The date of independence = = = 
 Since the transfer of power took place on the midnight of 14 and 15 August , the Indian Independence Act 1947 recognised 15 August as the birthday of both Pakistan and India . The act states ; 
 " As from the fifteenth day of August , nineteen hundred and forty @-@ seven , two independent Dominions shall be set up in India , to be known respectively as India and Pakistan . " 
 Jinnah in his first broadcast to the nation stated ; 
 " August 15 is the birthday of the independent and sovereign state of Pakistan . It marks the fulfilment of the destiny of the Muslim nation which made great sacrifices in the past few years to have its homeland . " 
 The first commemorative postage stamps of the country , released in July 1948 , also gave 15 August 1947 as the independence day , however in subsequent years 14 August was adopted as the independence day . The night of 14 – 15 August 1947 coincided with 27 Ramadan 1366 of the Islamic calendar , which Muslims regard as a sacred night . 
 = = Celebration = = 
 The independence day is one of the six public holidays observed in Pakistan and is celebrated all across the country . To prepare and finalise the plans for independence day celebrations , meetings are held in the provincial capitals by local government which are attended by government officials , diplomats , and politicians . As the month of August begins , special stalls and shops are set up across the country for the sale of national flags , buntings , banners and posters , pictures of national heroes , and other celebratory items . Vehicles , private buildings , homes , and streets are decorated with the national flag and buntings . Various organisations , educational institution , and government departments organise seminars , sports competitions , and social and cultural activities leading up to the independence day . In Karachi , drives are initiated to clean and prepare the Mazar @-@ e @-@ Quaid ( Jinnah Mausoleum ) for the celebration . 
 The day begins with special prayers for integrity , solidarity , and development of Pakistan in mosques and religious places across the country . The official festivities take place in Islamabad and commence with the raising of the national flag on the Parliament House and the Presidency followed by a 31 @-@ gun salute in the capital and a 21 @-@ gun salute in provincial capitals . The President and Prime Minister of Pakistan address the nation in live telecasts . Government officials and other political leaders deliver speeches during various rallies and events highlighting Pakistani achievements , goals set for the future , and praise the sacrifices and efforts of national heroes . National flags are displayed on <unk> @-@ e @-@ Faisal , <unk> @-@ e @-@ <unk> , and Mazar @-@ e @-@ Quaid Road leading up to the Jinnah 's mausoleum in Karachi . Minar @-@ e @-@ Pakistan in Lahore , where Pakistan Resolution was passed in 1940 , is fully illuminated on the eve of the independence day to signify its importance in the creation of Pakistan . 
 Citizens attending independence day parades and other events are usually dressed in Pakistan ’ s official colours , green and white . Various government buildings including the Parliament House , Supreme Court , and President House are decorated and illuminated with lights and bright colours . Streets and houses are decorated with candles , oil lamps and pennants , national flag as well as firework shows occur as a part of celebration . Along with flag hoisting , the national anthem is sung at various government places , schools , residences , and monuments on the day . Homage is paid to the people who lost their lives in migration and riots during the independence of Pakistan in 1947 , martyrs of Pakistan Army and recipients of Nishan @-@ e @-@ Haider , political figures , and famous artists and scientists . 
 A change of guard takes place at national monuments . In the cities around the country , the flag hoisting ceremony is carried out by the <unk> ( mayor ) belonging to the respective constituency and at various private organisations the ceremony is conducted by a senior officer of that organisation . The Pakistani diaspora also celebrates independence day in various countries throughout the world , especially in countries which have large Pakistani communities .

 Security measures in the country are intensified as the independence day approaches , especially in major cities and in troubled areas . The security is set up after various representatives of intelligence and investigation agencies meet . High alert is declared in sensitive areas such as the country 's capital , to restrict security threats . Despite this , there have been instances where attacks have occurred on independence day by insurgents who boycott the celebrations as a part of their protest . On 13 August 2010 , the country witnessed floods causing deaths of 1 @,@ 600 people and affecting 14 million lives . On the account of the calamity , the president made an announcement that there would not be any official celebration of the independence day that year .

 From the beginning of August , radio channels play milli <unk> ( patriotic songs ) and various TV shows and programmes highlighting the history , culture , and achievements of Pakistan are broadcast . Evergreen patriotic songs like Dil Dil Pakistan and <unk> @-@ e @-@ Junoon are played and sung all over the country . The film Jinnah released in 1998 follows the story of Jinnah and details the events leading up to the independence of Pakistan . The events during the independence of Pakistan are depicted in many literary and scholarly works . <unk> Singh 's novel Train to Pakistan , <unk> Hasan Manto 's short story Toba Tek Singh , Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre 's book Freedom at Midnight , and poetic works of Faiz Ahmad Faiz chronicle events during the independence of Pakistan . Ali Pur Ka <unk> by Mumtaz Mufti is an autobiography narrating the account of bringing his family from Batala to Lahore . <unk> aur Khoon ( Dirt and Blood ) by Naseem Hijazi describes the sacrifices of Muslims of South Asia during independence . <unk> , a Pakistani drama serial , based on the novel Bano by Razia Butt , also tells the story of Pakistan Movement and events of independence of Pakistan . 
 Pakistan Post released four commemorative stamps in July 1948 for the country 's first independence anniversary . Three of the four stamps depicted places from Pakistan while the fourth stamp depicted a motif . The stamps were inscribed " 15th August 1947 " because of the prevailing confusion of actual date of independence . In 1997 , Pakistan celebrated its 50th anniversary of independence . The State Bank of Pakistan issued a special banknote of rupee 5 depicting the tomb of Baha @-@ ud @-@ din Zakariya on 13 August 1997 , commemorating the 50th independence day . On the front of the note a star burst is encircled by Fifty Years Anniversary of Freedom in Urdu and ' 1947 – 1997 ' in numerals . 
 In November 1997 , the 1997 Wills Golden Jubilee Tournament was held in Gaddafi Stadium , Lahore to mark the golden jubilee . During the final of the tournament , Pakistan Cricket Board honoured all the living test cricket captains of Pakistan by parading them in horse @-@ drawn carriages and presenting them with gold medals . On 14 August 2004 , Pakistan displayed the largest flag of the time with the dimensions of 340 by 510 feet ( 100 m × 160 m ) . 
 Since 2011 , the Google Pakistan homepage has featured special doodles designed with Pakistani symbols to mark Pakistan 's Independence Day . Such symbols have included the star and crescent , national monuments and colours , artistic representations , geographic landscapes and other national symbols . In 2015 , Facebook allowed its users in Pakistan to post a status with a mood setting of " celebrating Independence Day " , with a Pakistani flag icon on the status . 
 = Beryllium = 
 Beryllium is a chemical element with symbol Be and atomic number 4 . It is created through stellar nucleosynthesis and is a relatively rare element in the universe . It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals . Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl ( aquamarine , emerald ) and chrysoberyl . As a free element it is a steel @-@ gray , strong , lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal . 
 Beryllium improves many physical properties when added as an alloying element to aluminium , copper ( notably the alloy beryllium copper ) , iron and nickel . Tools made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface . In structural applications , the combination of high flexural rigidity , thermal stability , thermal conductivity and low density ( 1 @.@ 85 times that of water ) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components , missiles , spacecraft , and satellites . Because of its low density and atomic mass , beryllium is relatively transparent to X @-@ rays and other forms of ionizing radiation ; therefore , it is the most common window material for X @-@ ray equipment and components of particle physics experiments . The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and beryllium oxide have led to their use in thermal management applications . 
 The commercial use of beryllium requires the use of appropriate dust control equipment and industrial controls at all times because of the toxicity of inhaled beryllium @-@ containing dusts that can cause a chronic life @-@ threatening allergic disease in some people called berylliosis .

 Beryllium is a steel gray and hard metal that is brittle at room temperature and has a close @-@ packed hexagonal crystal structure . It has exceptional stiffness ( Young 's modulus 287 GPa ) and a reasonably high melting point . The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 50 % greater than that of steel . The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12 @.@ 9 km / s at ambient conditions . Other significant properties are high specific heat ( 1925 J · kg − 1 · K − 1 ) and thermal conductivity ( 216 W · m − 1 · K − 1 ) , which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight . In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion ( 11 @.@ 4 × 10 − 6 K − 1 ) , these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading . 
 = = = Nuclear properties = = = 
 Naturally occurring beryllium , save for slight contamination by cosmogenic radioisotopes , is essentially beryllium @-@ 9 , which has a nuclear spin of 3 / 2 . Beryllium has a large scattering cross section for high @-@ energy neutrons , about 6 barns for energies above approximately 10 keV . Therefore , it works as a neutron reflector and neutron moderator , effectively slowing the neutrons to the thermal energy range of below 0 @.@ 03 eV , where the total cross section is at least an order of magnitude lower – exact value strongly depends on the purity and size of the crystallites in the material . 
 The single primordial beryllium isotope 9Be also undergoes a ( n , 2n ) neutron reaction with neutron energies over about 1 @.@ 9 MeV , to produce 8Be , which almost immediately breaks into two alpha particles . Thus , for high @-@ energy neutrons , beryllium is a neutron multiplier , releasing more neutrons than it absorbs . This nuclear reaction is : 
 9 
 4Be + n → 2 ( 4 
 2He ) + 2n 
 Neutrons are liberated when beryllium nuclei are struck by energetic alpha particles producing the nuclear reaction 
 9 
 4Be + 4 
 2He → 12 
 6C + n , where 4 
 2He is an alpha particle and 12 
 6C is a carbon @-@ 12 nucleus . 
 Beryllium also releases neutrons under bombardment by gamma rays . Thus , natural beryllium bombarded either by <unk> or <unk> from a suitable radioisotope is a key component of most radioisotope @-@ powered nuclear reaction neutron sources for the laboratory production of free neutrons . 
 Small amounts of tritium are liberated when 9 
 4Be nuclei absorb low energy neutrons in the three @-@ step nuclear reaction

 Note that 6 
 2He has a half life of only 0 @.@ 8 seconds , β- is an electron , and 6 
 3Li has a high neutron absorption cross @-@ section . Tritium is a radioisotope of concern in nuclear reactor waste streams . 
 As a metal , beryllium is transparent to most wavelengths of X @-@ rays and gamma rays , making it useful for the output windows of X @-@ ray tubes and other such apparatus . 
 = = = Isotopes and nucleosynthesis = = = 
 Both stable and unstable isotopes of beryllium are created in stars , but the radioisotopes do not last long . It is believed that most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust . Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope , 9Be , and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic element . 
 Radioactive cosmogenic 10Be is produced in the atmosphere of the Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen . 10Be accumulates at the soil surface , where its relatively long half @-@ life ( 1 @.@ 36 million years ) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron @-@ 10 . Thus , 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion , soil formation and the development of lateritic soils , and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores . The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity , because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth . Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air . This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites . The isotope 7Be ( half @-@ life 53 days ) is also cosmogenic , and shows an atmospheric abundance linked to sunspots , much like 10Be . 
 8Be has a very short half @-@ life of about 7 × 10 − 17 s that contributes to its significant cosmological role , as elements heavier than beryllium could not have been produced by nuclear fusion in the Big Bang . This is due to the lack of sufficient time during the Big Bang 's nucleosynthesis phase to produce carbon by the fusion of 4He nuclei and the very low concentrations of available beryllium @-@ 8 . The British astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle first showed that the energy levels of 8Be and 12C allow carbon production by the so @-@ called triple @-@ alpha process in helium @-@ fueled stars where more nucleosynthesis time is available . This process allows carbon to be produced in stars , but not in the Big Bang . Star @-@ created carbon ( the basis of carbon @-@ based life ) is thus a component in the elements in the gas and dust ejected by AGB stars and supernovae ( see also Big Bang nucleosynthesis ) , as well as the creation of all other elements with atomic numbers larger than that of carbon . 
 The innermost electrons of beryllium may contribute to chemical bonding . Therefore , when 7Be decays by electron capture , it does so by taking electrons from atomic orbitals that may participate in bonding . This makes its decay rate dependent to a measurable degree upon its electron configuration – a rare occurrence in nuclear decay . 
 The shortest @-@ lived known isotope of beryllium is <unk> which decays through neutron emission . It has a half @-@ life of 2 @.@ 7 × 10 − 21 s . <unk> is also very short @-@ lived with a half @-@ life of 5 @.@ 0 × 10 − 21 s . The exotic isotopes <unk> and <unk> are known to exhibit a nuclear halo . This phenomenon can be understood as the nuclei of <unk> and <unk> have , respectively , 1 and 4 neutrons orbiting substantially outside the classical Fermi ' <unk> ' model of the nucleus . 
 = = = Occurrence = = = 
 The Sun has a concentration of 0 @.@ 1 parts per billion ( ppb ) of beryllium . Beryllium has a concentration of 2 to 6 parts per million ( ppm ) in the Earth 's crust . It is most concentrated in the soils , 6 ppm . Trace amounts of 9Be are found in the Earth 's atmosphere . The concentration of beryllium in sea water is 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 6 parts per trillion . In stream water , however , beryllium is more abundant with a concentration of 0 @.@ 1 ppb . 
 Beryllium is found in over 100 minerals , but most are uncommon to rare . The more common beryllium containing minerals include : <unk> ( <unk> ( OH ) 2 ) , beryl ( <unk> ) , chrysoberyl ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) . Precious forms of beryl are aquamarine , red beryl and emerald . The green color in gem @-@ quality forms of beryl comes from varying amounts of chromium ( about 2 % for emerald ) . 
 The two main ores of beryllium , beryl and <unk> , are found in Argentina , Brazil , India , Madagascar , Russia and the United States . Total world reserves of beryllium ore are greater than 400 @,@ 000 tonnes . 
 = = Production = = 
 The extraction of beryllium from its compounds is a difficult process due to its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures , and its ability to reduce water when its oxide film is removed . The United States , China and Kazakhstan are the only three countries involved in the industrial @-@ scale extraction of beryllium . 
 Beryllium is most commonly extracted from the mineral beryl , which is either sintered using an extraction agent or melted into a soluble mixture . The sintering process involves mixing beryl with sodium fluorosilicate and soda at 770 ° C ( 1 @,@ 420 ° F ) to form sodium <unk> , aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide . Beryllium hydroxide is precipitated from a solution of sodium <unk> and sodium hydroxide in water . Extraction of beryllium using the melt method involves grinding beryl into a powder and heating it to 1 @,@ 650 ° C ( 3 @,@ 000 ° F ) . The melt is quickly cooled with water and then reheated 250 to 300 ° C ( 482 to 572 ° F ) in concentrated sulfuric acid , mostly yielding beryllium sulfate and aluminium sulfate . Aqueous ammonia is then used to remove the aluminium and sulfur , leaving beryllium hydroxide . 
 Beryllium hydroxide created using either the sinter or melt method is then converted into beryllium fluoride or beryllium chloride . To form the fluoride , aqueous ammonium hydrogen fluoride is added to beryllium hydroxide to yield a precipitate of ammonium <unk> , which is heated to 1 @,@ 000 ° C ( 1 @,@ 830 ° F ) to form beryllium fluoride . Heating the fluoride to 900 ° C ( 1 @,@ 650 ° F ) with magnesium forms finely divided beryllium , and additional heating to 1 @,@ 300 ° C ( 2 @,@ 370 ° F ) creates the compact metal . Heating beryllium hydroxide forms the oxide , which becomes beryllium chloride when combined with carbon and chlorine . Electrolysis of molten beryllium chloride is then used to obtain the metal . 
 = = Chemical properties = = 
 Beryllium 's chemical behavior is largely a result of its small atomic and ionic radii . It thus has very high ionization potentials and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms , which is why all of its compounds are covalent . It is more chemically similar to aluminium than its close neighbors in the periodic table due to having a similar charge @-@ to @-@ radius ratio . An oxide layer forms around beryllium that prevents further reactions with air unless heated above 1000 ° C. Once ignited , beryllium burns brilliantly forming a mixture of beryllium oxide and beryllium nitride . Beryllium dissolves readily in non @-@ oxidizing acids , such as HCl and diluted H2SO4 , but not in nitric acid or water as this forms the oxide . This behavior is similar to that of aluminium metal . Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions . 
 The beryllium atom has the electronic configuration [ He ] 2s2 . The two valence electrons give beryllium a + 2 oxidation state and thus the ability to form two covalent bonds ; the only evidence of lower valence of beryllium is in the solubility of the metal in BeCl2 . Due to the octet rule , atoms tend to seek a valence of 8 in order to resemble a noble gas . Beryllium tries to achieve a coordination number of 4 because its two covalent bonds fill half of this octet . A coordination of 4 allows beryllium compounds , such as the fluoride or chloride , to form polymers . 
 This characteristic is employed in analytical techniques using EDTA as a ligand . EDTA preferentially forms octahedral complexes – thus absorbing other cations such as Al3 + which might interfere – for example , in the solvent extraction of a complex formed between Be2 + and <unk> . Beryllium ( II ) readily forms complexes with strong donating ligands such as phosphine oxides and <unk> oxides . There have been extensive studies of these complexes which show the stability of the O @-@ Be bond . 
 Solutions of beryllium salts , e.g. beryllium sulfate and beryllium nitrate , are acidic because of hydrolysis of the [ Be ( H2O ) 4 ] 2 + ion . 
 [ Be ( H2O ) 4 ] 2 + + H2O ⇌ [ Be ( H2O ) 3 ( OH ) ] + + H3O + 
 Other products of hydrolysis include the trimeric ion [ Be3 ( OH ) 3 ( H2O ) 6 ] 3 + . Beryllium hydroxide , Be ( OH ) 2 , is insoluble even in acidic solutions with pH less than 6 , that is at biological pH . It is amphoteric and dissolves in strongly alkaline solutions . 
 Beryllium forms binary compounds with many non @-@ metals . Anhydrous halides are known for F , Cl , Br and I. BeF2 has a silica @-@ like structure with corner @-@ shared <unk> tetrahedra . BeCl2 and <unk> have chain structures with edge @-@ shared tetrahedra . All beryllium halides have a linear monomeric molecular structure in the gas phase . 
 Beryllium difluoride , BeF2 , is different than the other difluorides . In general , beryllium has a tendency to bond covalently , much more so than the other alkaline earths and its fluoride is partially covalent ( although still more ionic than its other halides ) . BeF2 has many similarities to SiO2 ( quartz ) a mostly covalently bonded network solid . BeF2 has tetrahedrally coordinated metal and forms glasses ( is difficult to crystallize ) . When crystalline , beryllium fluoride has the same room temperature crystal structure as quartz and shares many higher temperature structures also . Beryllium difluoride is very soluble in water , unlike the other alkaline earths . ( Although they are strongly ionic , they do not dissolve because of the especially strong lattice energy of the fluorite structure . ) However , BeF2 has much lower electrical conductivity when in solution or when molten than would be expected if it were fully ionic . 
 Beryllium oxide , BeO , is a white refractory solid , which has the wurtzite crystal structure and a thermal conductivity as high as in some metals . BeO is amphoteric . Salts of beryllium can be produced by treating Be ( OH ) 2 with acid . Beryllium sulfide , selenide and telluride are known , all having the zincblende structure . 
 Beryllium nitride , <unk> is a high @-@ melting @-@ point compound which is readily hydrolyzed . Beryllium azide , <unk> is known and beryllium phosphide , <unk> has a similar structure to <unk> . Basic beryllium nitrate and basic beryllium acetate have similar tetrahedral structures with four beryllium atoms coordinated to a central oxide ion . A number of beryllium borides are known , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Beryllium carbide , <unk> , is a refractory brick @-@ red compound that reacts with water to give methane . No beryllium silicide has been identified . 
 = = History = = 
 The mineral beryl , which contains beryllium , has been used at least since the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt . In the first century CE , Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder mentioned in his encyclopedia Natural History that beryl and emerald ( " <unk> " ) were similar . The Papyrus Graecus <unk> , written in the third or fourth century CE , contains notes on how to prepare artificial emerald and beryl . 
 Early analyses of emeralds and beryls by Martin Heinrich Klaproth , Torbern Olof Bergman , Franz Karl Achard , and Johann Jakob <unk> always yielded similar elements , leading to the fallacious conclusion that both substances are aluminium silicates . Mineralogist René Just Haüy discovered that both crystals are geometrically identical , and he asked chemist Louis @-@ Nicolas Vauquelin for a chemical analysis . 
 In a 1798 paper read before the Institut de France , Vauquelin reported that he found a new " earth " by dissolving aluminium hydroxide from emerald and beryl in an additional alkali . The editors of the journal Annales de Chimie et de Physique named the new earth " <unk> " for the sweet taste of some of its compounds . Klaproth preferred the name " <unk> " due to the fact that yttria also formed sweet salts . The name " beryllium " was first used by Wöhler in 1828 . 
 Friedrich Wöhler and Antoine Bussy independently isolated beryllium in 1828 by the chemical reaction of metallic potassium with beryllium chloride , as follows : 
 BeCl2 + 2 K → 2 KCl + Be 
 Using an alcohol lamp , Wöhler heated alternating layers of beryllium chloride and potassium in a wired @-@ shut platinum crucible . The above reaction immediately took place and caused the crucible to become white hot . Upon cooling and washing the resulting gray @-@ black powder he saw that it was made of fine particles with a dark metallic luster . The highly reactive potassium had been produced by the electrolysis of its compounds , a process discovered 21 years before . The chemical method using potassium yielded only small grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or hammered . 
 The direct electrolysis of a molten mixture of beryllium fluoride and sodium fluoride by Paul <unk> in 1898 resulted in the first pure ( 99 @.@ 5 to 99 @.@ 8 % ) samples of beryllium . The first commercially successful process for producing beryllium was developed in 1932 by Alfred Stock and Hans Goldschmidt . Their process involves the electrolysis of a mixture of beryllium fluorides and barium , which causes molten beryllium to collect on a water @-@ cooled iron cathode . 
 A sample of beryllium was bombarded with alpha rays from the decay of radium in a 1932 experiment by James Chadwick that uncovered the existence of the neutron . This same method is used in one class of radioisotope @-@ based laboratory neutron sources that produce 30 neutrons for every million α particles . 
 Beryllium production saw a rapid increase during World War II , due to the rising demand for hard beryllium @-@ copper alloys and phosphors for fluorescent lights . Most early fluorescent lamps used zinc <unk> with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light . Small additions of magnesium tungstate improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable white light . <unk> @-@ based phosphors replaced beryllium @-@ based phosphors after beryllium was found to be toxic . 
 Electrolysis of a mixture of beryllium fluoride and sodium fluoride was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century . The metal 's high melting point makes this process more energy @-@ consuming than corresponding processes used for the alkali metals . Early in the 20th century , the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of beryllium iodide was investigated following the success of a similar process for the production of zirconium , but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production . 
 Pure beryllium metal did not become readily available until 1957 , even though it had been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier . Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as beryllium chloride with metallic potassium or sodium . Currently most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with purified magnesium . The price on the American market for vacuum @-@ cast beryllium ingots was about $ 338 per pound ( $ 745 per kilogram ) in 2001 . 
 Between 1998 and 2008 , the world 's production of beryllium had decreased from 343 to about 200 tonnes , of which 176 tonnes ( 88 % ) came from the United States . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 Early precursors of the word beryllium can be traced to many languages , including Latin <unk> ; French <unk> ; Greek <unk> , <unk> , beryl ; Prakrit <unk> ( <unk> ‌ ) ; Pāli <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) or <unk> ( <unk> ् ) – " to become pale " , in reference to the pale semiprecious gemstone beryl . The original source is probably the Sanskrit word <unk> ् य ( <unk> ) , which is of Dravidian origin and could be related to the name of the modern city of Belur . For about 160 years , beryllium was also known as <unk> or <unk> ( with the accompanying chemical symbol " Gl " , or " G " ) , the name coming from the Greek word for sweet : <unk> , due to the sweet taste of beryllium salts . 
 = = Applications = = 
 = = = Radiation windows = = = 
 Because of its low atomic number and very low absorption for X @-@ rays , the oldest and still one of the most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X @-@ ray tubes . Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X @-@ ray images . Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X @-@ ray detectors , and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity , low energy X @-@ rays typical of synchrotron radiation . Vacuum @-@ tight windows and beam @-@ tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium . In scientific setups for various X @-@ ray emission studies ( e.g. , energy @-@ dispersive X @-@ ray spectroscopy ) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X @-@ rays have much lower energies ( ~ 100 eV ) than X @-@ rays from most studied materials . 
 Low atomic number also makes beryllium relatively transparent to energetic particles . Therefore , it is used to build the beam pipe around the collision region in particle physics setups , such as all four main detector experiments at the Large Hadron Collider ( ALICE , <unk> , CMS , <unk> ) , the <unk> and the SLAC . The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction , its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases , its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above absolute zero , and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with the complex <unk> magnet systems used to steer and focus the particle beams . 
 = = = Mechanical applications = = = 
 Because of its stiffness , light weight and dimensional stability over a wide temperature range , beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and aerospace industries in high @-@ speed aircraft , guided missiles , spacecraft , and satellites . Several liquid @-@ fuel rockets have used rocket nozzles made of pure beryllium . Beryllium powder was itself studied as a rocket fuel , but this use has never materialized . A small number of extreme high @-@ end bicycle frames have been built with beryllium . From 1998 to 2000 , the McLaren Formula One team used Mercedes @-@ Benz engines with beryllium @-@ aluminium @-@ alloy pistons . The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by Scuderia Ferrari . 
 Mixing about 2 @.@ 0 % beryllium into copper forms an alloy called beryllium copper that is six times stronger than copper alone . Beryllium alloys are used in many applications because of their combination of elasticity , high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity , high strength and hardness , nonmagnetic properties , as well as good corrosion and fatigue resistance . These applications include non @-@ sparking tools that are used near flammable gases ( beryllium nickel ) , in springs and membranes ( beryllium nickel and beryllium iron ) used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices . As little as 50 parts per million of beryllium alloyed with liquid magnesium leads to a significant increase in oxidation resistance and decrease in flammability . 
 The high elastic stiffness of beryllium has led to its extensive use in precision instrumentation , e.g. in inertial guidance systems and in the support mechanisms for optical systems . Beryllium @-@ copper alloys were also applied as a hardening agent in " Jason pistols " , which were used to strip the paint from the hulls of ships . 
 Beryllium was also used for cantilevers in high performance phonograph cartridge styli , where its extreme stiffness and low density allowed for tracking weights to be reduced to 1 gram , yet still track high frequency passages with minimal distortion . 
 An earlier major application of beryllium was in brakes for military airplanes because of its hardness , high melting point , and exceptional ability to dissipate heat . Environmental considerations have led to substitution by other materials . 
 To reduce costs , beryllium can be alloyed with significant amounts of aluminium , resulting in the <unk> alloy ( a trade name ) . This blend is cheaper than pure beryllium , while still retaining many desirable properties . 
 = = = Mirrors = = = 
 Beryllium mirrors are of particular interest . Large @-@ area mirrors , frequently with a honeycomb support structure , are used , for example , in meteorological satellites where low weight and long @-@ term dimensional stability are critical . Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire @-@ control systems , e.g. in the German @-@ made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks . In these systems , very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity . Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard <unk> nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium . In some applications , though , the beryllium blank is polished without any coating . This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle . 
 The James Webb Space Telescope will have 18 hexagonal beryllium sections for its mirrors . Because JWST will face a temperature of 33 K , the mirror is made of gold @-@ plated beryllium , capable of handling extreme cold better than glass . Beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass – and remains more uniform – in such temperatures . For the same reason , the optics of the Spitzer Space Telescope are entirely built of beryllium metal . 
 = = = Magnetic applications = = = 
 Beryllium is non @-@ magnetic . Therefore , tools fabricated out of beryllium @-@ based materials are used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams for work on or near naval mines , since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes . They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) machines because of the high magnetic fields generated by them . In the fields of radio communications and powerful ( usually military ) radars , hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons , magnetrons , traveling wave tubes , etc . , that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in the transmitters . 
 = = = Nuclear applications = = = 
 Thin plates or foils of beryllium are sometimes used in nuclear weapon designs as the very outer layer of the plutonium pits in the primary stages of thermonuclear bombs , placed to surround the fissile material . These layers of beryllium are good " pushers " for the implosion of the plutonium @-@ 239 , and they are also good neutron reflectors , just as they are in beryllium @-@ moderated nuclear reactors . 
 Beryllium is also commonly used in some neutron sources in laboratory devices in which relatively few neutrons are needed ( rather than having to use a nuclear reactor , or a particle accelerator @-@ powered neutron generator ) . For this purpose , a target of beryllium @-@ 9 is bombarded with energetic alpha particles from a radioisotope such as polonium @-@ 210 , radium @-@ 226 , plutonium @-@ 239 , or americium @-@ 241 . In the nuclear reaction that occurs , a beryllium nucleus is transmuted into carbon @-@ 12 , and one free neutron is emitted , traveling in about the same direction as the alpha particle was heading . Such alpha decay driven beryllium neutron sources , named " urchin " neutron initiators , were used some in early atomic bombs . Neutron sources in which beryllium is bombarded with gamma rays from a gamma decay radioisotope , are also used to produce laboratory neutrons . 
 Beryllium is also used in fuel fabrication for <unk> reactors . The fuel elements have small appendages that are resistance brazed to the fuel cladding using an induction brazing process with Be as the <unk> filler material . Bearing pads are brazed on to prevent fuel bundle to pressure tube contact , and inter @-@ element spacer pads are brazed on to prevent element to element contact . 
 Beryllium is also used at the Joint European Torus nuclear @-@ fusion research laboratory , and it will be used in the more advanced <unk> to condition the components which face the plasma . Beryllium has also been proposed as a cladding material for nuclear fuel rods , because of its good combination of mechanical , chemical , and nuclear properties . Beryllium fluoride is one of the constituent salts of the eutectic salt mixture FLiBe , which is used as a solvent , moderator and coolant in many hypothetical molten salt reactor designs , including the liquid fluoride thorium reactor ( <unk> ) . 
 = = = Acoustics = = = 
 The low weight and high rigidity of beryllium make it useful as a material for high @-@ frequency speaker drivers . Because beryllium is expensive ( many times more than titanium ) , hard to shape due to its brittleness , and toxic if mishandled , beryllium tweeters are limited to high @-@ end home , pro audio , and public address applications . Some high @-@ fidelity products have been fraudulently claimed to be made of the material . 
 = = = Electronic = = = 
 Beryllium is a p @-@ type dopant in III @-@ V compound semiconductors . It is widely used in materials such as GaAs , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( MBE ) . Cross @-@ rolled beryllium sheet is an excellent structural support for printed circuit boards in surface @-@ mount technology . In critical electronic applications , beryllium is both a structural support and heat sink . The application also requires a coefficient of thermal expansion that is well matched to the alumina and polyimide @-@ glass substrates . The beryllium @-@ beryllium oxide composite " E @-@ Materials " have been specially designed for these electronic applications and have the additional advantage that the thermal expansion coefficient can be tailored to match diverse substrate materials . 
 Beryllium oxide is useful for many applications that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor , with high strength and hardness , and a very high melting point . Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high @-@ power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications . Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets . Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes , but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes . 
 = = Healthcare = = 
 Beryllium is a component of several dental alloys . 
 = = Precautions = = 
 Approximately 35 micrograms of beryllium is found in the average human body , an amount not considered harmful . Beryllium is chemically similar to magnesium and therefore can displace it from enzymes , which causes them to malfunction . Chronic berylliosis is a pulmonary and systemic granulomatous disease caused by inhalation of dust or fumes contaminated with beryllium ; either large amounts over a short time or small amounts over a long time can lead to this ailment . Symptoms of the disease can take up to five years to develop ; about a third of patients with it die and the survivors are left disabled . The International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) lists beryllium and beryllium compounds as Category 1 carcinogens . In the US , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) has designated a permissible exposure limit ( PEL ) in the workplace with a time @-@ weighted average ( TWA ) 0 @.@ 002 mg / m3 and a constant exposure limit of 0 @.@ 005 mg / m3 over 30 minutes , with a maximum peak limit of 0 @.@ 025 mg / m3 . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) has set a recommended exposure limit ( REL ) of constant 0 @.@ 0005 mg / m3 . The IDLH ( immediately dangerous to life and health ) value is 4 mg / m3 . 
 Acute beryllium disease in the form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943 . A survey found that about 5 % of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium @-@ related lung diseases . Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects , and the differential diagnosis is often difficult . It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design , such as Herbert L. Anderson . 
 Beryllium may be found in coal slag . When the slag is formulated into an abrasive agent for blasting paint and rust from hard surfaces , the beryllium can become airborne and become a source of exposure . 
 Early researchers tasted beryllium and its various compounds for sweetness in order to verify its presence . Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt should be made to ingest this highly toxic substance . Beryllium and its compounds should be handled with great care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust ( lung cancer is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium @-@ laden dust ) . Although the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949 , potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium @-@ containing alloys , the manufacturing of electronic devices , and the handling of other beryllium @-@ containing material . 
 A successful test for beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published as an international voluntary consensus standard ASTM <unk> . The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to <unk> <unk> , allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace . Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration . The new procedure has been successfully tested on a variety of surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium ( ASTM <unk> ) .

 = = Early life = = 
 Stone was born on November 6 , 1988 , in Scottsdale , Arizona , to Krista Jean Stone ( née Yeager ) , a homemaker , and Jeffrey Charles Stone , the founder and CEO of a general @-@ contracting company . Her parents were co @-@ owners of the Camelback Golf Club , and she lived on the grounds of the Camelback Inn resort from the age of 12 to 15 . She has a younger brother , Spencer . Her paternal grandfather , Conrad <unk> Stone , was of Swedish descent . His family 's original surname " Sten " was anglicized as " Stone " when they immigrated to the United States through Ellis Island . She also has German , English , Scottish , and Irish ancestry . 
 As an infant , Stone had baby colic and cried frequently ; she later developed nodules and <unk> on her vocal chords . According to Stone , she was " loud " and " bossy " while growing up . She was educated at <unk> Elementary School and attended Cocopah Middle School for the sixth grade . Despite not liking school , she has said : " I made sure I got all As " citing her controlling nature as the reason . In a gymnastics class , she fell off the parallel bars and broke both arms . Stone also suffered panic attacks as a child ; she stated that the attacks caused a decline in her social skills . She underwent therapy but claims that it was her participation in local theater plays that helped cure the attacks . She recalled : 
 The first time I had a panic attack I was sitting in my friend 's house , and I thought the house was burning down . I called my mom and she brought me home , and for the next three years it just would not stop . I would go to the nurse at lunch most days and just wring my hands . I would ask my mom to tell me exactly how the day was going to be , then ask again 30 seconds later . I just needed to know that no one was going to die and nothing was going to change . 
 Stone was drawn to acting from the age of four . She wanted a career in sketch comedy initially , but shifted focus toward musical theater , and took voice lessons for several years . She made her acting debut at the age of 11 with a role in a theater production of The Wind in the Willows , playing the part of Otter . Stone was homeschooled for two years , during which time she appeared in sixteen productions at Phoenix 's Valley Youth Theatre , including : The Princess and the Pea , Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland , and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat . She also performed with the theater 's improvisational comedy troupe . She traveled to Los Angeles and auditioned unsuccessfully for a role in Nickelodeon 's All That . This led her parents to send her to private acting lessons with a local acting coach , who had worked at the William Morris Agency in the 1970s . 
 After attending Xavier College Preparatory ‍ — ‌ an all @-@ girl Catholic high school ‍ — ‌ as a freshman for one semester , Stone dropped out to become an actress . She prepared a PowerPoint presentation for her parents titled " Project Hollywood " ( featuring Madonna 's 2003 song " Hollywood " ) to convince them to let her move to California to pursue an acting career . In January 2004 , she moved with her mother to an apartment in Los Angeles . She recalled : " I went up for every single show on the Disney Channel and auditioned to play the daughter on every single sitcom , " adding , " I ended up getting none . " Between auditions for roles , she enrolled in online high @-@ school classes , and worked part @-@ time at a dog @-@ treat bakery .

 When Stone registered for the Screen Actors Guild the name " Emily Stone " was already taken . She chose " Riley Stone " as her stage name initially , but after guest @-@ starring on the Fox sitcom Malcolm in the Middle , she decided that she was more comfortable with " Emma " , a nickname that her mother had given her . She made her television debut as Laurie Partridge on the VH1 talent competition reality show In Search of the New Partridge Family ( 2004 ) . The resulting show , retitled The New Partridge Family ( 2004 ) , remained an unsold pilot . She followed this with guest appearances in a number of television series , including : Medium , Malcolm in the Middle , and Lucky Louie . She auditioned to star as Claire Bennet in the NBC science fiction drama Heroes and overheard in the casting room , " On a scale of 1 to 10 , you 're an 11 " ; but the casting directors were referring to Hayden Panettiere , who was cast instead . Stone deemed it her " rock bottom " experience . In April 2007 , she played Violet Trimble in the Fox action drama Drive , but the show was canceled after seven episodes . 
 Stone made her feature film debut in Greg Mottola 's comedy Superbad ( 2007 ) , co @-@ starring Michael Cera and Jonah Hill . The film tells the story of two high school students who go through a series of comic misadventures after they plan to buy alcohol for a party . To play the role of Hill 's romantic interest she dyed her hair red . A reviewer for The Hollywood Reporter found her " appealing " , but felt that her role was poorly written . Stone has described the experience of acting in her first film as " amazing ... [ but ] very different than other experiences I 've had since then " . The film was a commercial success , and earned her the Young Hollywood Award for Exciting New Face . 
 The following year , Stone starred in the comedy The Rocker ( 2008 ) playing Amelia Stone , the " straight face " bass guitarist in a band ; she learned to play the bass for the role . Stone , who has described herself as " a big smiler and <unk> " , admitted that she found it difficult portraying a character whose personality traits were so different from her own . The film , and her performance , received negative reviews from critics and was a commercial failure . However , her next release , the romantic comedy The House Bunny , performed better at the box @-@ office , becoming a moderate commercial success . The film saw her play the president of a sorority , and perform a cover version of the Waitresses ' 1982 song " I Know What Boys Like " . Reviews for the film were generally negative , though she was praised for her supporting role . TV Guide 's Ken Fox commented on her performance : " She 's positively incandescent , lighting up a movie that would be pretty dim without her . " That year , she also expressed a desire to become a film producer .

 Stone had three film releases in 2009 . Her first role was opposite Matthew McConaughey , Jennifer Garner , and Michael Douglas in Mark Waters 's Ghosts of Girlfriends Past . Loosely based on Charles Dickens ' 1843 novella A Christmas Carol , the romantic comedy has her playing a ghost who haunts her former boyfriend . Critical reaction to the film was negative , though it was a modest commercial success . Her most financially profitable venture that year was Ruben Fleischer 's $ 102 @.@ 3 million @-@ grossing horror comedy film Zombieland , in which she was featured alongside Jesse Eisenberg , Woody Harrelson , and Abigail Breslin . She appears as a con @-@ artist , and survivor of a zombie apocalypse in a role which Empire 's Chris Hewitt found to be " somewhat underwritten " . In a more positive review , The Daily Telegraph wrote : " [ T ] he hugely promising Stone ... [ is ] a tough cookie who projects the aura of being wiser than her years . " Stone 's final release in 2009 was Kieran and Michelle Mulroney 's Paper Man , a comedy @-@ drama which polarized critics . 
 Stone provided the voice of an Australian Shepherd in Marmaduke ( 2010 ) , a comedy from director Tom Dey , which is based on Brad Anderson 's long @-@ running comic strip of the same name . Her breakthrough came the same year with her starring role in Easy A , a teen comedy directed by Will Gluck ; website WatchMojo.com considered it her best performance to date . Partially based on Nathaniel Hawthorne 's 1850 historical romance novel The Scarlet Letter , the film tells the story of Olive <unk> ( Stone ) , a high school student who becomes embroiled in a comic sex scandal after a false rumor circulates that she is sexually promiscuous . Stone read the script before the project was optioned for production , and pursued it with her manager while production details were being finalized . She found the script " so different and unique from anything I 'd read before " , opining that it was " funny and sweet " . When Stone discovered that the film had begun production , she met with Gluck , expressing her enthusiasm for the project . A few months later , the audition process started and she met again with Gluck and was one of the first actresses to audition . The film received positive critical reviews , and Stone 's performance was considered its prime asset . Anna Smith of Time Out commented : " Stone gives a terrific performance , her knowing drawl implying intellect and indifference with underlying warmth . " With a total box office of US $ 75 million , the film was a commercial success . She was nominated for BAFTA Rising Star Award , and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy , and won the MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance . 
 In October 2010 , Stone hosted an episode of NBC 's late @-@ night sketch comedy Saturday Night Live , describing it as " the greatest week of my life " . She hosted it again in 2011 , appeared in an episode in 2014 , and in its 40th anniversary special in 2015 . A brief appearance in the sex comedy Friends with Benefits ( 2011 ) reunited Stone with Gluck . She followed this with a supporting role in Glenn <unk> and John Requa 's romantic comedy Crazy , Stupid , Love ( 2011 ) alongside Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling . The film features her as a law school graduate , and the love interest of Gosling 's character . Despite finding " some inevitable collapses into convention " in the film , Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that she " ties the whole film together " . At the 2012 Teen Choice Awards , she won the Choice Movie Actress – Comedy award for her performance in the film . Crazy , Stupid , Love was a box office success , grossing US $ 142 @.@ 9 million worldwide with a production budget of US $ 50 million . 
 Disillusioned at being typecast as the " sarcastic interest of the guy " , Stone co @-@ starred with Viola Davis in Tate Taylor 's period drama The Help ( 2011 ) , a film she found to be challenging . The film is based on Kathryn Stockett 's 2009 novel of the same name and is set in 1960s Jackson , Mississippi . She met with Taylor to express a desire to work in the film . Taylor said : " Emma was completely awkward and dorky , with her raspy voice , and she sat down and we got a little intoxicated and had a blast , and I just thought , ' God ! God ! This is Skeeter . " He cast her in the role . She portrayed Eugenia " Skeeter " Phelan , an aspiring writer learning about the lives of the African @-@ American maids . In preparation for the part , she trained to speak in a Southern dialect ; in addition , she educated herself on the civil rights movements through literature and film . With a worldwide gross of US $ 216 million against a budget of US $ 25 million , The Help became Stone 's most commercially successful film at that point . The film , and her performance , received positive reviews from critics . Writing for Empire , Anna Smith thought that Stone was " well @-@ meaning and hugely likable " despite finding " flaws " in her character . The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture , and won Best Ensemble Cast from the Women Film Critics Circle and the Broadcast Film Critics Association .

 Vikram was born in a Tamil Family as Kennedy to a Christian father and a Hindu mother in Madras , Tamil Nadu , on 17 April 1966 . His father , John Victor alias Vinod Raj was a native of Paramakudi and ran away from home to start a career in films . His father however did not fare successfully , and only managed to act in supporting roles in Tamil films and television serials and this inspired Vikram to take part in theatre lessons and become professionally trained in classical and cinema dance forms to ensure he became a leading actor . Rajeshwari , Vikram 's mother , was a sub @-@ collector and her brother , Thyagarajan is an established director @-@ actor in the Tamil film industry ; with his son , actor Prashanth , being Vikram 's first cousin . Vikram has a younger sister , Anita , who is a teacher and a younger brother , Arvind , who was previously set to make his film debut in the 2008 film Saroja but eventually did not feature .

 Vikram was educated at Montfort School , <unk> , a boarding school in a hill station near Salem and graduated in 1983 . He has mentioned that he used his opportunities at school well by taking part in karate , horseback riding and swimming and noted that such early exposure to activities gave him confidence as a youngster . Vikram lurked in the fringes of the school 's theatre club for a long period and often took part in backstage work before being handed the lead role in a school adaptation of Molière 's The Doctor in Spite of Himself after the original lead had contracted chicken pox . Despite expressing his interest to join films after school , his father forced him to go through education with Vikram subsequently graduating in English literature from Loyola College , Chennai and working half way through an MBA programme .

 Vikram began his professional career by modelling in advert films for brands including Chola Tea , TVS Excel and Alwyn watches as well as appearing in a six episode television serial titled Galatta <unk> which aired between November and December 1988 . During the final year of his <unk> programme at Loyola College , he was recognised by the film industry , with veteran director C. V. Sridhar approaching him for a lead role in a film . Vikram made his film debut in 1990 by appearing in En Kadhal Kanmani , a small budget love story featuring him alongside Rekha Nambiar , with Sridhar 's <unk> <unk> Ennai opposite Rohini being his next release . He then signed on to be a part of cinematographer P. C. Sriram 's college love story , Meera with high expectations , however the three films failed to launch his career . His appearances in Meera and in <unk> <unk> , with another veteran director S. P. Muthuraman , helped him secure film offers from the Malayalam and Telugu film industries . In 1993 , he almost signed on to appear in Mani Ratnam 's Bombay and featured in the initial photo shoot alongside Manisha Koirala . However Mani Ratnam wanted Vikram to remove his beard for the role , and Vikram could not do so due to continuity problems with another film he had signed and hence was dropped from the project . 
 Between 1993 and 1994 , Vikram appeared in a series of films where he portrayed supporting roles . He appeared in three successful Malayalam films by appearing with Mammooty , Suresh Gopi and Jayaram in Joshi 's successful action film <unk> , before teaming up with Gopi again for Shaji Kailas 's Mafia , which explored Bangalore 's criminal underworld . Furthermore , Joshi cast him again alongside Mammooty in the action drama <unk> in the role of an air cadet . During the period , Vikram also appeared in the small budget Telugu film <unk> <unk> in the lead role and as Akkineni Nageswara Rao 's eldest son in the family drama Bangaru <unk> with both films failing commercially . A brief return to Tamil films also proved unsuccessful , with his role in Vikraman 's <unk> Pudhiya <unk> with music composed by A. R. Rahman turning out to be a commercial failure . 
 Throughout 1995 and 1996 , Vikram appeared in further Telugu and Malayalam films to receive income , being kept away from Tamil films due to a lack of offers . He played the lead role in Malayalam film <unk> <unk> directed by <unk> 's and even played villain in Street opposite Babu Antony and lead roles in the small budget Telugu films <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 's Akka ! <unk> ? . He collaborated again with Mammooty in <unk> and Suresh Gopi in <unk> , before appearing in his first lead role in Malayalam with <unk> Oru <unk> opposite Laila . Vikram signed Amitabh Bachchan 's first Tamil language film production , <unk> , which also featured Ajith Kumar and <unk> . The big budget film created anticipation prior to release but was ultimately panned and fared poorly at the box office . However , Vikram acknowledged the film for expanding his female fan base as a result of the soft @-@ personality of his character . He followed it up with appearances in the unsuccessful films <unk> <unk> in Telugu and then in the Ilaiyaraaja musical <unk> <unk> , before playing a short role in Parthiban 's critically acclaimed film , Housefull . 
 During his struggling phase , Vikram dubbed for other heroes in films including voices for Prabhu Deva in <unk> and Minsara Kanavu , Ajith Kumar in Amaravathi and Abbas in <unk> <unk> respectively . Vikram has mentioned that he did not look down on dubbing and saw it as a " dignity of labour " . During the period he also attended dancing classes every day , and tried acting out different scenes , different characters with his small group of friends . He began to turn down chances to play supporting roles in films and was intent on making a breakthrough as a lead actor and notably turned down the role of <unk> 's fiancée in Mani Ratnam 's Alaipayuthey . Vikram also rejected approaches from television serial producers , citing that working in television would reduce his chances of becoming a mainstream actor . He also refused opportunities to take part in film events as a backing dancer , with actor <unk> revealing that Vikram was " one amongst not many " who was not interested in travelling to Canada to participate in such shows .

 In 1997 , debutant director Bala offered him the role of the rogue , Sethu ( Chiyaan ) , in the film Sethu . To prepare for the character , Vikram shaved his head , lost twenty @-@ one kilograms and grew his nails long for the role . After beginning production in April 1997 , the film went through development hell after industry strikes and lack of funds hampered progress . During this phase , he did not accept other acting offers in order to maintain the continuity of his looks . The film then struggled to find a distributor , who shunned it due to the tragic climax and the film remained unreleased . Vikram described the period of production as " the worst phase of his career " as he was financially strapped and " his fire was in danger of dying down " . He turned down an opportunity from a friend to take up a job in technology and attempted to stay in the industry by directing a serial titled <unk> <unk> , with Ameer as his assistant director . Sethu finally released in December 1999 and initially began running at a single noon show at a suburban theater but gradually gained an audience through word @-@ of @-@ mouth publicity . Eventually it ran for over one hundred days at several cinema halls across Chennai . Vikram was constantly being mobbed by people on the streets as a result of the film 's success . Critics praised Vikram 's performance with a reviewer referring to Vikram as " a revelation " and that " he is very natural and his acting in last few scenes are just too good and could even be compared with the best we have seen " .

The performance drew accolades with Vikram winning the Filmfare Special Award – South and the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for his portrayal of the title character , while reports emerged that he missed out on the National Film Award for Best Actor by a single vote to Mohanlal . Post @-@ Sethu , Vikram has described the film would have been close to him regardless of its commercial success and that it put him on the " right path " , with Vikram choosing to adapt the prefix of Chiyaan to his screen name . 
 Vikram did not sign up to a film for sixty five days after the release of Sethu , to ensure that he made the right career move . Vikram spent time completing projects he had agreed to feature in before the release of Sethu and hence made a couple of appearances in the Malayalam films , Red Indians and the horror film <unk> . He also played a leading role in <unk> , a rare Tamil telefilm produced and featuring Radhika Sarathkumar , which was shot entirely in the suburbs of London . Furthermore , he also completed two Telugu films during the period ; 9 <unk> and Youth . 9 <unk> featured Vikram as the husband of the character played by Soundarya , who faces the challenges of being a surrogate mother . The film won positive reviews , with a critic mentioning that Vikram gave a " controlled performance ; while Vikram 's newfound popularity in Tamil films saw the film dubbed into Tamil soon after as <unk> <unk> , with an inserted comedy track by comedian Vivek . His next release was <unk> 's <unk> <unk> , alongside Sarath Kumar , Kushboo and <unk> , which revolved around an ordinary boy falling in love with an actress . Vikram has since mentioned his displeasure at being a part of the film , claiming that he had arguments with the director for every single shot and that " everything in that film , right from the first shot was wrong " ; the film became a failure commercially . His next film was Dhill where he played an aspiring police officer , <unk> , who tackles a corrupt policeman . To appear trim in the role of the aspiring police officer , Vikram went on a strict diet eating only fruits and drinking juice . The film opened to positive reviews with a critic from The Hindu claiming that " Vikram has the ability and potential " and that " Vikram has once again proved that his success in Sethu was not a fluke " . Dhill subsequently went on to become Vikram 's first success in the masala film genre and led the way for more such films in the same genre for him . Vikram 's portrayal of a blind folk singer in <unk> 's Kasi won him the Filmfare Best Tamil Actor Award and the film also did well commercially . For the movie , he <unk> on the terrace of his beachside home in Chennai for a sunburnt look and got dizzying headaches while practising to look blind . Again , Vikram 's performance won positive reviews from critics with a reviewer describing it as an " extraordinarily detailed performance " and that " as the blind singer , he brings laughter , tears and a lump in one ’ s throat " .

The action film won good reviews , with a critic citing that Vikram " delivers a convincing performance " and consequently became a box office triumph . Similarly , the film 's soundtrack composed by Bharathwaj had become popular prior to release , with Vikram also singing a version of the hit song " O Podu ! " for the album . Balaji Sakthivel 's Samurai was his next release featuring him as a vigilante Robin Hood @-@ esque figure who kidnapped corrupt politicians .

Later in the year , he signed and completed Shafi 's comedy film with Asin , Majaa , in less than five months .

Despite being a non @-@ speaker and making his debut in Hindi , he dubbed his lines in the language remarking jovially it was the " most difficult thing in the world " . After promotions at the Cannes Film Festival and a premiere at Leicester Square in London , the two versions and the dubbed Telugu version released simultaneously in 2 @,@ 200 screens worldwide and took a big opening on day one earning 20 crores . The Tamil version , Raavanan won rave reviews from critics with The Hindu calling it a " masterstroke " and claiming Vikram " raises the bar higher with every venture " . The critic cited that " emotions of love , animus , anguish and joy dance on his face in quick succession " , concluding that " Vikram lifts the role to an admirable level " . The critic from Sify labelled it as a " astonishing portrayal " , while the critic from the Hindustan Times praised Vikram 's " ability to get into Veeraiya ’ s skin and emote with conviction " . The Tamil version consequently went on to become a commercial success , with Vikram 's performance leading to him winning the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actor among other accolades . In contrast , the Hindi version fetched mixed reviews with critics agreeing that Vikram 's performance as the tribal leader was more convincing than Bachchan 's . Baradwaj Rangan , writing for The New Indian Express rated the film 4 / 5 and said " Raavan falls for Sita ( and vice versa ) in an intriguingly idiosyncratic take on the Ramayana – if you can get past the lead performances , that is " whereas Taran Adarsh , writing for Bollywood Hungama rated it 1 @.@ 5 / 5 and said , " On the whole , Raavan is a king @-@ sized disappointment , in terms of content " though mentioning that Vikram was " first @-@ rate , although the role isn 't substantial enough " . Raavan subsequently went on to become a surprise flop at the Indian box office . The film was also screened at the Venice Film Festival and the Busan International Film Festival , with Vikram in attendance . 
 After two years of discussions , Vikram began a film under the direction of Selvaraghavan in a project dubbed by the media as <unk> . The film began shoot and completed a schedule by early 2010 in the Himalayas with Swati Reddy appearing as the female lead . However , the film was reported to be momentarily shelved and subsequently never took off again after the producer <unk> Ramesh walked out . Vikram then agreed terms to feature in Vikram Kumar 's 24 produced by Mohan Natarajan , with Ileana D 'Cruz signed on to play the female lead role . The film progressed briefly with shots being canned in caves , before the director was ousted from the project , cancelling the film . Vikram then also shot briefly for a third successive shelved project directed by <unk> Pandian for the same producer , featuring him in the role of an investigative cop ; however the film failed to progress and instead Natarajan financed Vikram 's next . His 2011 release , Deiva Thirumagal directed by A. L. Vijay , saw Vikram portray a father with a developmental disability having the mental maturity of a seven @-@ year @-@ old . To prepare for the role , Vikram visited homes for the mentally challenged such as Vidya Sagar and Vidya Sudha for a month , watching their body language and taking notes . He also communicated with the patients , to pick up the nuances of people with impaired speech . Vikram has since gone on to describe his role as Krishna as the best character he has ever portrayed . The film which also featured Sara Arjun , Anushka Shetty and Amala Paul in supporting roles , opened to predominantly positive reviews from critics and enjoyed commercial success at the box office . The reviewer from The Deccan Chronicle described that the film was " Vikram ’ s show all the way " and that " his rendition of a mentally @-@ challenged man trying to cope with the everyday realities of raising a child is a work of art " , praising his " fiery , complex performance as one of the more viciously honest depictions of mental illness cinema has seen " . Similarly another critic described that the on @-@ screen chemistry between Vikram and his daughter , played by Sara Arjun , is " magic " and their performances " are sure to leave a lump in your throat " . The critic from The Hindu praised the film and Vikram 's performance but analysed that " a problem arises only when you stop looking at Krishna as a character , and begin to see him as Vikram , the hero " and that Vikram should have " underplayed a little here and there and it would have worked better " . However Vikram once again completed a sweep of the top acting awards that year , with further recognition at the Vijay and Filmfare Awards . 
 Vikram next featured in Rajapattai ( 2011 ) alongside <unk> Seth under the direction of <unk> where he played a henchman trying to get a break in the Tamil film industry . The film opened to mixed reviews from critics in December 2011 and performed below expectations at the box office . Vikram also completed half of a fantasy period film during 2011 , <unk> in which he played Karikala Chola , a Tamil king who ruled in 270 BC , opposite <unk> Khan under the direction of graphics director Kannan , but the film was later shelved owing to production troubles . He then appeared in his second project with director Vijay , portraying the lead role of a blinded RAW agent in the action @-@ thriller , <unk> . The film , which also featured Anushka Shetty , Amy Jackson and Lakshmi Rai in pivotal roles , opened to mixed reviews in September 2012 . For his role of a blind man , Vikram trained under noted human echolocation specialist Daniel Kish , with the latter also playing a cameo in the film . A critic from Sify.com noted that it was " Vikram and him alone who diverts your attention from the film 's little logical script flaws and <unk> you with an endearing act that is <unk> 's biggest strength " ; subsequently the film did average business commercially . The actor was next seen portraying the title role in Bejoy Nambiar 's bilingual David , which released with different cast members in Hindi and Tamil . Vikram remained the only common lead actor in the versions , with his segment playing out a love story between a careless drunkard fisherman and a mute girl played by Isha Sherwani . While the Tamil version opened to predominantly positive review , the Hindi film also won mixed reviews , with both films performing average business at the box office .

 Vikram signed on to collaborate again with Shankar for I , a romantic thriller opposite Amy Jackson , in early 2012 . Following hushed production developments , it was revealed that the actor would sport four significantly different looks in the film : a body builder , a beast , a model and a hunchback . He put on weight to portray the bodybuilder , sticking to a diet of protein and coffee , to ensure his muscles are defined on screen . Vikram subsequently lost weight to portray a model , before shaving his head and reducing his weight to 56 kilograms to portray the crippled hunchback . He changed his physique by eating small meals of egg whites and apples instead of regular food intakes , while engaging in an intensive weight loss regime to become thin . The cast and crew of the film reportedly struggled to recognise the actor at times , while he also stayed away from the media for close to a year when sporting the look . Taking almost three years for production , Vikram described the film " as the toughest he has ever done " and regularly suffered folliculitis as a result of the prosthetic make @-@ up he had to wear . The film opened amidst much expectation in January 2015 to mixed reviews , though critics gave Vikram 's portrayal of <unk> , unanimously positive reviews . A critic from Times of India noted " Vikram bowls you over with a heart @-@ wrenching performance whether he is handsome or disfigured " , while The Hindu added his transformation was " laudable " , and that " Vikram wins hearts as the earnest @-@ to @-@ boot gym rat and as the strapping new model on the block , he floors the audience with his performance as <unk> , the deformed hunchback " . Similarly Rediff.com noted the actor " is truly impressive and deserves much applause " , while Sify.com added he " lived the role " . Despite mixed reviews , I performed well at the box office , as well as becoming the most successful Tamil film of all time in Kerala . He then worked on Vijay Milton 's road @-@ thriller , 10 <unk> ( 2015 ) , which featured him as an unnamed race driver who goes on a road trip through India . Paired opposite Samantha , the film opened to mixed reviews and did not perform well at the box office . A critic from Sify.com however noted Vikram " breathes life to his role and his energy level is highly infectious " , adding that " the way he smiles , dances and fight is a treat for his fans " . Likewise a critic from The Hindu criticised the film 's script adding " it 's hard to see Vikram in this fluff " . Vikram is currently working simultaneously on two different projects , with the first release likely to be Iru Mugan , an action film directed by Anand Shankar , featuring him alongside Nayantara and Nithya Menen . He is also a part of Thiru 's Garuda , where he features alongside Kajal Aggarwal .

In 2000 , Vikram and actress Meena launched a pop album titled <unk> , which the pair would sing and appear in music videos for , although the project was completed without much promotion . Following the success of Bharathwaj 's music for Vikram 's 2002 film Gemini , Vikram sang a version of the hit song " O Podu ! " for the extended version of the album . During the making of Kanthaswamy in 2009 , the music composer Devi Sri Prasad had asked Vikram to sing a few rough tracks during the film ’ s song composition in Malaysia . The producers were impressed with his voice and Vikram ended up singing four songs in the film . Furthermore , Vikram also recorded all four tracks in the Telugu version of the album titled Mallana . He then went on to sing for a film he was unrelated to , by lending five different voices in " <unk> " for G. V. Prakash Kumar 's album in <unk> . He sang two further songs under Prakash Kumar for his Deiva Thirumagal , singing in the voice of his character , an adult with the maturity of a six @-@ year @-@ old . In 2011 he sang the song " <unk> <unk> " for his film Rajapattai under composer Yuvan Shankar Raja 's direction . Vikram announced his own production company Reel Life Entertainment in July 2009 and announced that Sasikumar would direct his first film , the action thriller <unk> , featuring <unk> , Vaibhav , <unk> and <unk> Bajpai . However , after 90 % of the shoot had been completed , Vikram pulled out of the venture citing that Sasikumar had overshot his budget and the director eventually bought and released the film . The actor however was later listed as one of the three producers for his 2013 bilingual film , David , thereby making his debut in film financing . Vikram has also worked as the assistant director under Shafi in Majaa , and has mentioned he would like to direct a film in the future .

 = Garrick 's Temple to Shakespeare = 
 Garrick 's Temple to Shakespeare is a small garden folly erected in 1756 on the north bank of the River Thames at Hampton in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames . Grade I listed , it was built by the actor David Garrick to honour the playwright William Shakespeare , whose plays Garrick performed to great acclaim throughout his career . During his lifetime Garrick used it to house his extensive collection of Shakespearean relics and for entertaining his family and guests . It passed through a succession of owners until coming into public ownership in the 20th century , but fell into serious disrepair by the end of the century . After a campaign supported by distinguished actors and donations from the National Lottery 's " good causes " fund , it was restored in the late 1990s and reopened to the public as a museum and memorial to the life and career of Garrick . It is reputedly the world 's only shrine to Shakespeare . 
 = = Description = = 
 The temple is an octagonal domed building with a nod to the Pantheon , Rome , constructed in undecorated brick with a single east @-@ facing entrance . It was built in the Classical style popularised by the Italian architect Palladio with an Ionic portico , four columns wide by three deep , flanking the entrance . Several steps lead up to the portico . Inside , glazed arched windows reaching to the ground face the river . A deep curved recess in the west wall provides room for a statue . Outside , a lawn and garden provide views over the Thames to the south . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 Garrick built the temple on land adjoining a villa that he had bought in October 1754 to serve as a country retreat . The villa 's riverside garden , a plot now known as Garrick 's Lawn , was separated from the main property by the road from Kingston upon Thames to Staines . Garrick commissioned the building of an elaborate grotto @-@ tunnel under the road , illuminated by 500 lanterns , to facilitate private access to the lawn from the house . 
 At some point in 1755 he decided to build a summer @-@ house by the riverside which he intended to dedicate to his muse Shakespeare as a " temple " to the playwright . The temple 's architect is unknown as his decision to build it is not recorded in his own papers . Robert Adam and Lancelot " Capability " Brown have both been suggested as possibilities . An " Ionic Temple " of similar design stands in the gardens of Chiswick House a few miles away . This may well have been the inspiration for Garrick 's Temple , as Garrick had spent his honeymoon at Chiswick House a few years earlier in the company of his wife 's guardians the <unk> . 
 On 4 August 1755 , his neighbour and friend Horace Walpole wrote to a correspondent : " I have contracted a sort of intimacy with Garrick , who is my neighbour . He affects to study my taste ; I lay it all upon you – he admires you . He is building a graceful temple to Shakespeare : I offered him this motto : Quod <unk> et <unk> , si <unk> <unk> est [ If I inspire and give pleasure , it is because of you ] . " A year later , Walpole wrote in another letter : 
 He has built a temple to his master Shakespear [ sic ] , and I am going to adorn the outside , since his modesty would not let me decorate it within , as I proposed , with these mottos : 
 The garden in front of the temple was laid out in accordance with Garrick 's friend William Hogarth 's theory of the Line of Beauty . An S @-@ shaped path ran between flowering shrubs in accordance with the theory 's preference for serpentine shapes . Walpole donated a grove of Italian cypresses to plant in the garden . It was widely admired in its time and its idyllic prospect so moved Samuel Johnson that he told Garrick : " Ah , David , it is the leaving of such places that makes a deathbed so terrible . " 
 = = = Contents = = = 
 The temple 's interior was furnished as a shrine to Shakespeare . It was dominated by a statue of the playwright commissioned by Garrick from the French Huguenot sculptor Louis @-@ François Roubiliac at a cost of 300 guineas ( £ 315 , equivalent to approximately £ 32 @,@ 000 now ) . Roubiliac chose to model the statue on the Chandos portrait of Shakespeare while Garrick himself is said to have posed for the sculpture . Its appearance is rather more reminiscent of Garrick than Shakespeare ; it is said that the actor struck a pose and exclaimed , " Lo , the Bard of Avon ! " to illustrate how he wanted Shakespeare to be portrayed . The statue 's head was not to Garrick 's satisfaction , and Roubiliac had to replace it with another , carved from a different type of marble . During Garrick 's lifetime the statue was displayed in the temple . On his death it was willed to the British Museum , where it is still on display in the King 's Library . A copy of the statue , donated by the museum , is currently displayed in the temple . 
 Garrick exhibited his collection of Shakespeare relics in the temple , including a chair made from a mulberry tree which had supposedly been planted by Shakespeare in the grounds of New Place , his house at Stratford upon Avon . The chair was designed by Hogarth , according to Walpole , and had a medal of Shakespeare carved into its backrest . The chair survives and is today owned by the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington , D.C .. Other items on display included various personal effects of Shakespeare such as " an old leather glove , with pointed fingers and blackened metal embroidery " , a dagger and " a signet ring with W.S. on it . " The collection was sold and dispersed on the death of Garrick 's widow ; he had collected so much Shakespearean memorabilia that it took ten days to auction it all . 
 = = = Usage = = = 
 Garrick employed the temple not just as a museum but as a working building . As well as using it as a quiet place to learn his lines and write letters , the actor used it to entertain his wife and guests for afternoon tea and dinner . The painter Johann Zoffany , a protégé of Garrick , painted a number of scenes of the actor , his wife and their friends on the lawn and in front of the temple . One of his guests , the letter @-@ writer Mrs Delany , described the scene at one such entertainment in a letter of 1770 : 
 We had an excellent dinner nicely served , and then went over directly into the garden – a piece of irregular ground sloping down to the Thames , very well laid out , and planted for shade and shelter ; and an opening to the river which appears beautiful from that spot , and from Shakespeare 's Temple at the end of the Improvement , where we drank tea , and where there is a very fine statue of Shakespeare in white marble , and a great chair with a large carved frame , that was Shakespeare 's own chair , made for him on some particular occasion , with a medallion fixed in the back . Many were the relics we saw of the favourite poet . At six o 'clock Lady Weymouth 's fine group of children walked into the garden , which added to the agreeableness of the scene . 
 His visitors were encouraged to pay homage to the Bard by writing verses in Shakespeare 's honour and placing them at the foot of the statue . Garrick had the best of them published anonymously in the London journals . Some found this practice cloying ; Samuel Foote commented sarcastically that Garrick had " dedicated a temple to a certain divinity ... before whose shrine frequent libations are made , and on whose alter the fat of venison , a <unk> grateful to this deity , is seen often to smoke . " 
 In August 1774 , the temple and gardens were the centrepiece of Garrick 's elaborate silver jubilee celebrations to celebrate 25 years of marriage . The London Chronicle reported : 
 Last night Mr Garrick gave a splendid entertainment or Fete <unk> at his gardens at Hampton . Signior Torre conducted a most brilliant fire @-@ work ; an elegant concert of music was performed ; and the company , which consisted of a great number of Nobility and Gentry , expressed the utmost satisfaction on the occasion . The temple of Shakespeare , and gardens , were illuminated with 6000 lamps , and the forge of Vulcan made a splendid appearance . 
 Garrick also opened the temple and garden to the public on special occasions . Each May Day , seated on the chair noted by Mrs Delany and accompanied by his wife , he would give the poor children of Hampton money and cakes . A woman who attended one such May Day event later recalled : " When I was called up , I took my six [ children ] into the Temple , where Mr Garrick was sitting by the fine bust with great cakes before him ; he took down all their names , and then gave a shilling and a piece of plum @-@ cake to every individual one ; not even leaving out poor babes in their mothers ' arms . " 
 = = = Preservation and restoration = = = 
 The temple and villa remained in the hands of Garrick 's wife until her death in 1822 at the age of 98 . It was subsequently bought by her solicitor , Thomas Carr , who preserved it as a monument to Garrick and even erected a statue of him in the temple to replace the Roubiliac Shakespeare . It changed hands several more times until , in 1923 , the villa was converted into apartments . The riverside lawn was sold separately along with the temple and was bought by a Paul Glaize , who built a three @-@ storey house alongside the temple . This caused such controversy and public outcry that in 1932 the site was bought by Hampton Urban District Council so that Glaize 's Temple House could be demolished . The lawn and temple were subsequently opened to the public . They have remained in public ownership ever since . 
 During the Second World War the temple was used as a post for Air Raid Precautions wardens . It was given Grade I listed status in September 1952 and became part of a conservation area in the 1960s , when it was used for poetry readings . However , it had become neglected and vandalised by the 1970s . It suffered from wet and dry rot , vibrations from traffic on the busy nearby road had damaged the fabric of the building and thieves had stolen the lead off the roof . Donald Insall Associates , a specialist conservation architectural firm , was commissioned by Richmond upon Thames Council to restore the building at a cost of £ 37 @,@ 000 . The work was carried out by the building firm <unk> and the architect James <unk> Forge . Patrick Baty advised on the paint colours .
