 UN Secretary @-@ General Ban in early October publicly recognized many of the challenges of the weapons destruction effort , in particular the dangerous nature of chemical arms destruction during a civil war , especially in urban areas such as Damascus , Aleppo , and Homs . " Heavy artillery , air strikes , mortar barrages and the indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas are commonplace and battle lines shift quickly , " he wrote . Ban added that the most challenging phase of the destruction effort would begin in November , when OPCW and UN experts begin destroying Syria 's estimated 1 @,@ 000 tons of precursor chemicals and chemical weapons . In order to do so , they will need to cross battle lines between governments and rebel forces . The Syrian government and Western @-@ backed opposition forces have pledged cooperation with chemical disarmament , but Al Qaeda @-@ linked rebel groups , including Al Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , have not . 
 OPCW director @-@ general Ahmet <unk> stated in early October that completing the destruction process by the mid @-@ 2014 deadline will depend on whether temporary cease @-@ fires can be arranged between opposition and government forces . A nine @-@ month ceasefire to allow the OPCW to carry out the entire chemical weapons destruction process was rejected by the Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) , according to a report in Asharq Al @-@ Awsat ( a Saudi @-@ linked pan @-@ Arab newspaper ) . 
 Also exceptionally challenging will be the movement and destruction of deadly agents such as sarin , VX nerve agents and mustard gas during the civil war . The chemical weapons convention disallows movement of such deadly agents outside the country holding them , but Security Council Resolution 2118 allows extraordinary measures to be taken in Syria . Some of the chemicals will need to be transported along the highway between Damascus and Homs , which is still contested as of December 2013 . Syria has requested the international community provide armored vehicles to assist in safe transport of the chemicals . In February 2014 , Syria stated that rebels had attempted to attack two convoys transporting chemical weapons . 
 OPCW director @-@ general <unk> called the overall timeline " <unk> , " though one of his field experts characterized it as " Herculean . " The Economist magazine commented in October 2013 that the timeline was " ambitious , to put it mildly , " but acknowledged it had been " worked out in consultation with American and Russians experts with full knowledge of the OPCW 's capabilities . " Li Hong , secretary @-@ general of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association , stated that both the turbulent civil war and the financial cost of chemical weapons disposal will be a heavy burden on the Syrian government , and called it " unrealistic " to expect Syrian chemical weapons to be fully eliminated by 2014 . Expert opinions were summarized in Foreign Policy magazine as follows : " Taking control of [ Syria ] ' s enormous stores of [ chemical ] munitions would be difficult to do in the midst of a brutal civil war . Dozens of new facilities for destroying the weapons would have to be built from scratch or brought into the country from the U.S. , and completing the job would potentially take a decade or more . " 
 In October 2013 , Amy Smithson of the Center for <unk> Studies stated that the government appears to be cooperating , but cautioned that the Syrian government has a " very sorry track record " on working with nuclear inspectors , and that it is easier to hide chemical weapons than a nuclear program . Chemical weapons expert Gwyn Winfield writes that Syria has an incentive to hold onto some of its chemical weapons , since its original incentive for developing a chemical weapons capability , as a deterrent against a suspected Israeli nuclear weapons arsenal , " isn 't going to go away . " In contrast , Ralf Trapp , a former OPCW official , has expressed optimism that satellite surveillance would deter cheating . Under the disarmament resolution , Syria is required to allow inspection of any site that raises suspicions . 
 A disagreement arose regarding the number of chemical weapons sites in contested areas of Syria , with the Syrian foreign minister stating that one @-@ third of sites are in such areas . FSA official <unk> Miqdad stated in early October that there were no chemical weapons in areas occupied by opposition forces , " which is something that the Assad regime itself acknowledges , while these storehouses are also not located on the front , so why should we stop fighting ? " According to the OPCW chief , one abandoned site is in rebel @-@ held territory and routes to others lead through rebel @-@ held territory . Malik <unk> of the OPCW states that few of the locations inspectors must visit will be difficult to access . 
 In April 2014 , disarmament experts such as Ralf Trapp characterized the pace of the operation as impressively quick . With 92 @.@ 5 % of the arsenal removed or destroyed , Trapp noted that many people hadn 't expected such speed to be achievable given the ongoing civil war . 
 = = = Later activity = = = 
 In late October 2013 , the <unk> said it expected 1 November deadline for destruction of CW production , mixing and munition @-@ filling capability to be met . It was reported on 23 October that it had visited 18 of 23 declared sites . It was reported that " ' low tech , quick and cheap ' methods were being used , such as filling equipment with concrete , smashing it , sometimes using heavy vehicles . " The OPCW " said the Syrian government had provided complete co @-@ operation with the 27 weapons inspectors in the country . " 
 On 31 October , the OPCW announced that it had met the deadline for destroying all declared equipment and facilities related to chemical weapons production , having visited 21 out of 23 sites , and received assurances from the Syrian government that the other two sites had been abandoned and emptied of chemicals and equipment , with these dispersed to sites visited by the OPCW . The two sites were unreachable due to being in contested areas of the ongoing civil war . On 7 November , the OPCW said that one of the two unvisited sites had been officially verified as " dismantled and abandoned " , based in part on images that the Syrian government shot using a " <unk> " GPS @-@ enabled camera provided by the OPCW . Later , in January 2014 , U.S. Ambassador Robert <unk> worried that the October destruction was incomplete and " reversible " and claimed that it did not , in fact , meet requirements . 
 On 15 November , the OPCW approved a plan to transport Syria 's chemical weapons to a location outside its territory by 5 February 2014 , where the weapons would then be destroyed . Acceptance of shipments of the 1 @,@ 000 tons of chemical agents for destruction have been refused by most countries approached by the OPCW . As of November 2013 , Belgium and France were still considering whether to agree to such shipments . 
 The countries of Norway and Denmark agreed to transport the chemical weapons from Syria to Italy where they were to be handed over to a United States Navy ship for destruction in international waters . The Norwegian Fridtjof Nansen @-@ class frigate Helge <unk> will take part in the operation , as will the Norwegian marine corps unit <unk> . The Norwegian government hired in the Norwegian registered RoRo cargo ship MV Taiko for the mission . Denmark will participate with the Danish frigate <unk> Esbern Snare and the Danish government has hired in the civilian cargo ship Ark Futura for the mission . 
 The United States will destroy the highest @-@ priority chemicals , which were scheduled for removal from Syria by 31 December , on board the MV Cape Ray in international waters of the Mediterranean , using an U.S. Army Field Deployable Hydrolysis System . The United Kingdom will give the United States specialist equipment and training to enable the highest @-@ priority chemicals to be processed more quickly . In addition around 150 tonnes of priority two chemicals , toxic material similar to industrial chemical agents , will be transported to the UK with the help of the British Royal Navy and destroyed there . The remaining stock of priority two chemicals not going to Britain will be destroyed by commercial companies . 
 The first shipment of components for chemical weapons were removed from Syria by a Norwegian / Danish flotilla on 7 January 2014 . The 31 December deadline for complete removal of priority chemicals had been missed ; on 7 January , the New York Times assessed the delay was due to the difficulty of overland transport of chemical weapons in the middle of a civil war . A second shipment was removed around 27 January ; that same day , the U.N. Secretary General , Ban Ki @-@ moon , expressed concern over the worsening delays and assessed that Syria already has the resources required to transport the weapons promptly despite the ongoing civil war . 
 On 2 July , the Danish ship Ark Futura arrived in the Italian port of Gioia <unk> , carrying the chemical weapons , which were then loaded onto the U.S. ship Cape Ray . The Cape Ray was equipped with two Field Deployable Hydrolysis Systems capable of neutralizing the poisonous substances and converting them into industrial waste . On 19 July 2014 , around 250 protesters gathered at the Souda base to protest the elimination of the chemical weapons in the nearby region of the Mediterranean Sea . 
 = = = = Delays = = = = 
 By 30 January 2014 , only about four percent of the priority chemicals had been removed . Syria continued to blame security issues ; U.S. officials disagreed and accused the government of deliberately causing or prolonging the delay . On 31 January , Russian diplomat Mikhail Ulyanov responded that " the Syrians are approaching the fulfilment of their obligations seriously and in good faith . " The U.S. blamed Syria 's Assad government for intentionally delaying efforts to remove chemical arms from the country for destruction , suggesting that the goal of liquidating the arsenal by midyear is in jeopardy . Stating that Assad is , in effect , slow @-@ walking the chemicals in order to obtain more security equipment , U.S. Ambassador Robert P. <unk> said that " Syria has demanded armored jackets for shipping containers , electronic countermeasures , and detectors for improvised explosive devices . " He said the demands are " without merit " and " display a ' bargaining mentality ' rather than a security mentality . " 
 Around 21 February , Syria proposed a hundred @-@ day plan for removal of the chemicals . British official Philip Hall criticized the plan as " not adequate " . At the time , the US had stated destruction of the chemicals , once off @-@ site , would take 90 days ; given that timeframe , Syria 's proposed May removal deadline would not leave enough time for all munitions to be destroyed to meet the end @-@ of @-@ June deadline for complete destruction of Syria 's chemical weapons . Around 4 March , Syria agreed to a 60 @-@ day timetable for removal of the stockpile . By 4 March 2014 , almost a third of the stockpile had been removed or destroyed . 
 Syria missed a 15 March deadline for destroying its 12 chemical weapons production facilities . Syria has proposed to instead render the facilities inoperable by sealing their entrances ; the U.S. and its allies oppose this proposal and insist on destruction . 
 By 21 March , Syria 's entire supply of mustard gas had been removed . On 27 April , Syria missed its revised 60 @-@ day deadline for complete removal of its full chemical weapons arsenal . As at 23 May , Syria had removed or destroyed 92 @.@ 5 % of its declared chemical stockpile . 
 On 23 June , the head of OPCW , Ahmet <unk> , announced in The Hague that the last of Syria 's declared chemical weapons had been shipped out of the country for destruction . The last 8 % of the chemical stockpile was loaded on to ships at Latakia . The most toxic chemicals , including sarin precursors and sulphur mustard , were destroyed by 18 August aboard the US naval vessel MV Cape Ray . The remaining were destroyed in the US , Great Britain and Finland . On 4 January 2015 , the OPCW confirmed that the destruction was completed . 
 Despite American criticisms of the delays , the OPCW has described Syria 's cooperation as " satisfactory " . 
 = = Problems with cargo = = 
 In a news article published in Norway 's biggest newspaper Verdens Gang in December 2015 , it was revealed that the operation had been far more dramatic than what was expected and reported . There were rocket attacks against Latakia while " Taiko " was docked . There were explosions and strikes around the docks and there were incidents were possible suicide boats would come to close to the ships and had to be warned off . The commander of the Norwegian frigate commanded that the moorings on the freighter " Taiko " was rigged with explosives every time she went to land in Syria . The goal : To get from the country as soon as possible if anything happened . From the get go , the shipments of containers that was transported to the cargo ships was in bad shape and they leaked lethal material and gases . The containers were characterized by having been filled up hastily in a war zone before they were transported to the pier and handed on to the Norwegian forces . When almost half of the cargo gave signal of leakage of lethal material , an emergency meeting was held onboard Taiko with representatives from OPCW , UN , USA , Norway , Denmark , Syria and Finland . The Norwegian soldiers were ordered to deal with the situation . However no country would accept a docking of the ship with the material leaking on board , and Norwegian personnel and ships had to sail back to Syria and deal with and open the sealed containers and move the material to different containers . 
 = = Alleged violations = = 
 Chlorine , a common industrial chemical , was allegedly used in poison @-@ gas attacks by the Assad government in 2014 . Chlorine is not on the list of prohibited chemicals covered by the disarmament agreement ; however , its use as a weapon violates the Chemical Weapons Convention . 
 In July 2014 , Assad disclosed to the OPCW " a facility for the production of ricin " but stated that " the entire quantity of ricin produced was disposed of prior to the entry into force " of the Chemical Weapons Convention . The lateness of this disclosure raised doubts about the completeness of the government 's declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile . The Israeli intelligence community believes the Assad government retains several tons of chemical weapons . 
 = = Declared sites and chemical weapons = = 
 Syria declared 23 sites to OPCW , the location of which are not disclosed for confidentiality reasons . On these sites a combined 41 facilities were present containing " 1 @,@ 300 tons of chemical precursors and agents and 1 @,@ 230 unfilled munitions " . 
 According to U.S. chemical weapons nonproliferation expert Amy Smithson , declared sites are believed to include : 
 four production facilities near Safira , Khan Abu <unk> , Homs , and Hama 
 six storage facilities near Safira , Homs , Hama , <unk> , Latakia , and Palmyra 
 a research and development site in Damascus 
 In October 2013 , the OPCW directly inspected 21 of the 23 sites . The OPCW was able to indirectly confirm that the other two , unreachable , sites had been abandoned . 
 = = = Allegations of undisclosed sites = = = 
 The Economist reported in early October that Syria had disclosed 19 chemical weapons @-@ related sites , whilst unnamed Western intelligence sources believed 45 sites to exist in total . One U.S. official said it was not clear if the discrepancy is " a deception " or merely a " difference of definition " regarding what constitutes a chemical weapons site . In Science Insider , experts stated that there was a possibility of incomplete record @-@ keeping , citing an incident in 2002 wherein Albania discovered , in a cluster of mountain bunkers , 16 tons of primitive , undocumented chemical weapon agents that Albania had forgotten about . Chemical weapons expert Winfield has commented that the success of the destruction plan depends on Syria revealing all of its chemical arms stockpile , much of which is moveable and may be spread across dozens of sites . 
 = <unk> = 
 The nuckelavee ( pronunciation : / <unk> / ) or <unk> is a horse @-@ like demon from Orcadian mythology that combines equine and human elements . It has its origins in Norse mythology , and is the most horrible of all the demons of the Scottish islands . The nuck component of its name may be cognate with Nick in Old Nick , a name for the Christian Devil . The nuckelavee 's breath was thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock , and the creature was held responsible for droughts and epidemics on land despite its being predominantly a sea @-@ dweller . 
 A graphic description of the nuckelavee as it appears on land was given by an islander who claimed to have had a confrontation with it , but accounts describing the details of the creature 's appearance are inconsistent . In common with many other sea monsters it is unable to tolerate fresh water , therefore those it is pursuing have only to cross a river or stream to be rid of it . The nuckelavee is kept in confinement during the summer months by the Mither o ' the Sea , an ancient Orcadian spirit , and the only one able to control it . 
 Orcadian folklore had a strong Scandinavian influence , and it may be that the nuckelavee is a composite of a water horse from Celtic mythology and a creature imported by the Norsemen . As with similar malevolent entities such as the kelpie , it possibly offered an explanation for incidents that islanders in ancient times could not otherwise understand . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The late 19th century saw an upsurge of interest in transcribing folklore , but the recorders used inconsistent spelling and frequently anglicised words , thus the same entity could be given different names . The term nuckelavee derives from Orcadian <unk> , and according to Orkney resident and 19th @-@ century folklorist Walter Traill Dennison means " Devil of the Sea " . The same demon is called a <unk> in Shetland , where it was considered a nasty sea trow or sea devil . Samuel Hibbert , an antiquarian of the early nineteenth century , considered the component nuck of the nuckelavee 's name to be cognate with both the Nick in Old Nick , a name sometimes given to the Devil of Christian belief , and with the Latin <unk> , to kill . 
 = = Folk beliefs = = 
 = = = Description and common attributes = = = 
 Stories of mythical Orcadian demons are recorded in the 16th @-@ century Latin manuscripts of Jo Ben , who may have been referring to the nuckelavee in his description of the Orkney island of Stronsay . Dennison transcribed much of the information available about traditional tales told on Orkney , but to an extent romanticised and systematically altered certain elements of the stories in the process of transforming them into prose . 
 The nuckelavee is a mythical sea creature that appears as a horse @-@ like demon when it ventures onto land . Writer and folklorist Ernest Marwick considered it very similar to the Norwegian <unk> , the nuggle of the Shetlands and the kelpie . A unique and solitary creature possessing extensive evil powers , its malevolent behaviour can influence events throughout the islands . Islanders were terrified of the creature and would not speak its name without immediately saying a prayer . It was often found in the vicinity of a beach , but would never come ashore if it was raining . 
 No tales describe what form the nuckelavee takes when in the sea , but its appearance on land has been recounted in graphic detail . An islander , Tammas , claimed to have survived a confrontation with the beast and , after much cajoling from Dennison , reluctantly gave his description of the monster , the only known first @-@ hand account . According to Tammas , the nuckelavee has a man 's torso attached to a horse 's back as if it were a rider . The male torso has no legs , but its arms can reach the ground from its position on top of the equine body , the legs of which have fin like appendages . The torso has a large head – possibly as much as 3 feet ( 90 centimetres ) in diameter – that rolls back and forth . The monster described by Tammas has two heads ; the equine head has an enormous gaping mouth that exudes a smelly toxic vapour , and a single giant eye like a burning red flame . A particularly gruesome detail is that the nuckelavee has no skin ; black blood courses through yellow veins , and the pale sinews and powerful muscles are visible as a pulsating mass . Other reports state that the creature resembles a centaur ; narratives are inconsistent in the finer details of the demon 's description however . Traill Dennison only describes a man 's head with a " mouth projected like that of a pig " . Marwick also only mentions one head with a single red eye , and he borrows some of Tammas 's characterisation by recording the creature 's mouth as " like a whale 's " . 
 The nuckelavee 's breath was thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock , and it was considered responsible for epidemics and drought . Seaweed burning to create what was known at the time as kelp began on Stronsay in 1722 . The product – soda ash – was an alkali mainly used to treat acidic soil , although as time went on its commercial importance in soap and glass manufacture increased . The pungent smoke emitted during the process was believed to enrage the nuckelavee , resulting in a wild rampage of plague , the deaths of cattle and the destruction of crops . The nuckelavee was said to have infected horses on Stronsay with the deadly disease known as <unk> , to demonstrate its fury and exact its revenge against the islanders for burning seaweed ; the infection subsequently spread to all the other islands involved in the industry . The creature was also blamed for prolonged periods of abnormally low rainfall , leading to water shortages and poor harvests . 
 = = Confinement = = 
 The nuckelavee is the most malevolent of the demons in and around the Scottish islands , without any redeeming characteristics . The only entity able to control it is the Mither o ' the Sea , an ancient spirit in Orcadian mythology who keeps the nuckelavee confined during the summer months . In common with other mythical sea monsters , with the possible exception of kelpies and the nuggle of Shetland , it is unable to wade through fresh flowing water , therefore those it is chasing have only to cross a stream to be rid of it . Tammas managed to escape from the nuckelavee after he inadvertently splashed it with water from the loch he was alongside ; this briefly distracted the monster , allowing Tammas to run over to a nearby channel of fresh water and jump to safety on the opposite bank . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Malevolent creatures possibly served to provide explanations for incidents that islanders from bygone times were otherwise unable to account for ; many ancient myths were based upon the natural elements of the turbulent and ever changing sea around Orkney . Established Orcadian tales were strongly influenced by Scandinavian mythology with a blending of traditional Celtic stories , so the nuckelavee may have its roots in a mythical creature imported by the Norsemen fused with a traditional Celtic water horse . 
 = Lassie ( 1954 TV series ) = 
 Lassie is an American television series that follows the adventures of a female Rough Collie dog named Lassie and her companions , both human and animal . The show was the creation of producer Robert Maxwell and animal trainer Rudd Weatherwax and was televised from September 12 , 1954 , to March 25 , 1973 . The fourth longest @-@ running U.S. primetime television series after The Simpsons , Gunsmoke , and Law & Order , the show chalked up 17 seasons on CBS before entering first @-@ run syndication for its final two seasons . Initially filmed in black and white , the show transitioned to color in 1965 . 
 The show 's first 10 seasons follow Lassie 's adventures in a small farming community . Fictional eleven @-@ year @-@ old Jeff Miller , his mother , and his grandfather are Lassie 's first human companions until seven @-@ year @-@ old Timmy Martin and his adoptive parents take over in the fourth season . When Lassie 's exploits on the farm end in the eleventh season , she finds new adventures in the wilderness alongside United States Forest Service Rangers . After traveling on her own for a year , Lassie finally settles at a children 's home for her final two syndicated seasons . 
 Lassie received critical favor at its debut and won two Emmy Awards in its first years . Stars Jan Clayton and June Lockhart were nominated for Emmys . Merchandise produced during the show 's run included books , a Halloween costume , clothing , toys , and other items . Campbell 's Soup , the show 's lifelong sponsor , offered two premiums ( a ring and a wallet ) , and distributed thousands to fans . A multi @-@ part episode was edited into the feature film Lassie 's Great Adventure and released in August 1963 . Selected episodes have been released to DVD .

 = = = Concept and development = = = 
 Between 1943 and 1951 , the fictional collie , Lassie , was the inspiration for seven MGM feature films . With completion of the seventh film in 1951 , the studio planned no further films for the Lassie character or Pal , the dog actor who portrayed the fictional canine . In lieu of $ 40 @,@ 000 back pay owed him by MGM , Pal 's owner and trainer Rudd Weatherwax took all rights to the Lassie trademark and name , and hit the road with Pal to perform at fairs , rodeos , and other venues . 
 Needing material for the relatively new medium of television , producer Robert Maxwell sold Weatherwax on the concept of a Lassie television series with a boy and his dog theme . The two men developed a scenario about a struggling war widow , her young son , and her father @-@ in @-@ law set on a weather @-@ beaten , modern day American farm . Two pilots were filmed in Calgary , Alberta , Canada with the first telling the story of the bond forged between boy and dog , and the second filmed to give potential sponsors and network buyers an idea of a typical episode . After viewing the pilots , CBS put the show on its fall 1954 schedule . Campbell 's Soup Company signed on early as the show 's sole sponsor and remained so for the show 's entire run . Filming for the series began in the summer of 1954 , and Lassie made its début Sunday , September 12 , 1954 , at 7 : 00 p.m. EST , a time slot the show would call home on CBS for the next seventeen years . 
 In 1957 , Jack Wrather , owner of the hit television series The Lone Ranger and Sergeant Preston of the Yukon purchased all rights to the Lassie television show for $ 3 @.@ 25 million , and guided the show through its next several seasons . As 1964 and the show 's eleventh season approached , the decision was made to completely rework the show ; the boy and his dog theme was dropped and Lassie was teamed with a succession of United States Forest Service workers . The show focused on conservation and environmentalism , but its relevance in a time of social change was questioned . The show began a steady decline in ratings . In 1971 , new rulings regarding network prime time scheduling were handed down from the Federal Communications Commission , and CBS canceled the show . Lassie then entered first @-@ run syndication for two seasons before televising its last new episode on Sunday March 25 , 1973 . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 The show 's title character is portrayed in the two pilots by Pal , the MGM film Lassie . Thereafter , five of his male descendants played the role . His son Lassie Junior performed through the Jeff years and first two Timmy years before retiring in 1959 to battle cancer . Though he recovered , Lassie Junior never worked the show again . His son Spook was rushed into the series while his brother Baby was in training for the role . Spook was inadequately prepared and never became comfortable on the set after an overhead light crashed to the floor on his first day . Weatherwax , however , coaxed a natural and seemingly confident performance from the frightened dog , and , for some , Spook 's portrayal represents Weatherwax 's finest work . Spook played the role in the spring and fall of 1960 . Baby , son of Lassie Junior and brother to Spook , worked the show for six years . He appeared in the last Timmy years , and two of the Forest Service seasons . Baby died at eight years of age , the only Lassie not to live at least seventeen years . He was followed in the role by Mire who played Lassie for five years . Hey Hey portrayed the fictional collie in the syndicated seasons . 
 Broadway star and quiz show panelist Jan Clayton was hired to play farm widow Ellen Miller with septuagenarian George Cleveland playing her father @-@ in @-@ law , George " Gramps " Miller . Child actor Tommy Rettig was hired to portray Ellen ’ s eleven @-@ year @-@ old son Jeff Miller , and Donald Keeler ( the professional name used at the time by Joey D. Vieira ) was cast as Jeff 's friend , Sylvester " Porky " Brockway . Porky 's basset hound Pokey became a recurring animal character through the first several seasons . 
 In 1957 , Clayton and Rettig wanted to leave the show . Producers decided to find a new boy and ease the Miller family out of the show . Two hundred boys were interviewed , and six @-@ year @-@ old film veteran Jon Provost was hired and made his début as Timmy in the fourth season opener , " The Runaway . " In July 1957 , George Cleveland died unexpectedly , and producers were forced to overhaul the show . The plot was extensively reworked and Clayton and Rettig were dropped . Cloris Leachman and Jon Shepodd were quickly hired as Timmy ’ s adoptive parents Ruth and Paul Martin . In the fourth season , George Chandler was hired to play Petrie Martin , Paul 's uncle , but was later dropped . As fourth season shooting progressed , Leachman grew unhappy playing a tired farm woman , feuded on @-@ set with co @-@ workers , and proved unpopular with viewers . Ratings dropped . When filming was completed for the 1957 – 58 season in February 1958 , Wrather severed ties with producer Maxwell and dropped Leachman and Shepodd . Film veteran June Lockhart and Broadway stage star Hugh Reilly replaced the two at the top of the fifth season . Todd Ferrell played Timmy 's friend Ralph " Boomer " Bates with his dog Mike a recurring character but both were dropped in 1959 . 
 Former Keystone Kop Andy Clyde , also a co @-@ star of The Real McCoys , became a regular in 1959 as neighbor Cully Wilson . 
 Guest stars during the Timmy years included " The Lone Ranger " , Roy Campanella , Olympian Rafer Johnson , Stacy Keach , Marie Windsor , Dick Foran , Tod Griffin , Jane Darwell , Denver Pyle , Fuzzy Knight , Harry Carey , Jr . , William Schallert , and Karl Swenson . 
 During its first four years , Lassie received very decent ratings . However , at the end of the 1958 @-@ 1959 season , the ratings had fallen out of the top 30 due to the constant turnover in the cast . Once viewers began to warm to Lockhart and Reilly as Timmy 's parents , the Martin family was accepted and embraced by the public . As a result , between 1960 and 1964 , Lassie 's ratings greatly improved and by the spring of 1964 , it received its highest rating ever , ranking at # 13 . 
 In 1964 , Provost declined to renew his contract . Producers decided to broaden the show 's demographics to appeal to older viewers , and , to that end , dropped the boy and his dog theme for a plot featuring a Forest Service Ranger . Robert Bray , a former Marine and Gary Cooper look @-@ alike was cast as Corey Stuart . During Bray 's first year , the show transitioned to color filming and spectacular scenic locations across America were exploited as settings for the show . Eventually , Bray 's alcoholism forced him from the show , and Jack De <unk> and Jed Allan were hired to replace him . 
 Guest stars during the Ranger years included Ken Osmond , Paul Petersen , Suzanne Somers , Victor French , and Morgan Brittany . When the Forest Service years came to an end , Lassie wandered on her own for a season then settled at the Holden ranch for her final two syndicated seasons with costars Ron Hayes , Larry Pennell , Skip Burton , Larry Wilcox , Sherry Boucher , and <unk> <unk> .

 Novelist Inez Asher was among those who wrote for the series , while other scripts were produced by writers blacklisted during the heyday of McCarthyism and the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee . These writers included Robert Lees ( credited as J. E. Selby ) and Adrian Scott , one of the Hollywood Ten who went to prison for contempt of the United States Congress . His wife , Joan Scott writing as Joanne Court , attended story conferences and gave her husband notes so he could do rewrites . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The show 's first studio was Stage One of KTTV in Los Angeles , California , with the production moving to Desilu in 1957 . Franklin Canyon Reservoir and Vasquez Rocks saw location shootings . During the Timmy seasons , episodes were filmed at the Grand Canyon and in the High Sierra , and , during the Forest Service seasons , the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior offered Alaska , Puerto Rico , the Washington Monument and other sites for location shoots . 
 Fifteen pages were filmed per day , six days a week , with three shows completed per week . Shooting in order was not possible . Several barn segments might be filmed at a particular time with the crew then moving on to film an equal number of kitchen scenes . The shots may have then been used in four or five different episodes . Rettig was allowed to bond with the dog and often groomed the dog at the studio or spent weekends at Weatherwax 's home playing with the animal . The bond translated to film , making the boy and dog scenes more believable , but , eventually the dog developed divided loyalties ( looking to Rettig for direction rather than Weatherwax ) and the trainer was forced to curtail the amount of time boy and dog spent together . 
 Typically , there were two dog trainers on the set , each teetering on a stepladder only Lassie could see and waving a chunk of meat at the dog . " It would look as though Lassie was looking at Jon ( Provost ) , but he was really looking past Jon at the piece of beef " , Lockhart recalled in 2004 . When Provost delivered his line , the trainer behind Lockhart would whisper " Lassie ! " and wave another piece of meat . Lassie 's head would turn to Lockhart who would deliver her line . Then the trainer behind Provost would get Lassie 's attention again , and Provost would deliver his next line . " The sound editor would cut out all that , " Lockhart said , " You finally got to where you never heard the trainers . Often , if the scene had gone well , and maybe we hadn 't gotten the dialogue quite right , if the dog was right , they 'd print it . " In addition to the main Lassie , three other <unk> might be involved in an episode shoot : a stand @-@ in for rehearsals , a stunt double , and a " fighter " for scenes involving battles with other animals . 
 = = = Theme music = = = 
 Lassie used several pieces of theme music during its long broadcast history . For the first season , " Secret of the Silent Hills ( Theme from the Lassie TV series ) " , is used for both the opening and ending theme . Composed by William Lava , the orchestral theme was originally created for the 1940 radio show The Courageous Dr. Christian . 
 For the second and third season a variation of this theme , titled simply " Lassie Main & End Title " , was used for the opening and ending theme . Raoul Kraushaar , the music director for the series , is the listed composer for the theme ; however the changes he made to the original are so slight that only a trained ear can tell the difference . The third theme used for the series is an orchestral rendition of the aria , " Dio Possente " ( Even Bravest Hearts May Swell ) from Charles Gounod 's opera , Faust . The exact time this theme started being used is uncertain due to conflicting records ; however it is agreed that it was the third series , and was used for at least part of season four for the change of ownership of Lassie . 
 The most famous of the Lassie theme songs appeared at the start of the fifth season . <unk> as " Lassie Main & End Title " , the song was created by Les Baxter , with the whistling itself performed by Muzzy Marcellino . Nicknamed " The Whistler , " it remained the series theme for the rest of the " Martin years " . With the coming of the " Ranger years " , the opening and ending theme was changed to Nathan Scott 's arrangement of the traditional folk tune Greensleeves . An orchestral " Whistler " returned for the series theme during the thirteenth season for the seven @-@ part " Voyager " episode , and would remain the series theme for the rest of its run . Television composer Nathan Scott scored the music to nearly every episode between 1963 and 1973 , except for four episodes . 
 = = = Sponsor = = = 
 Campbell 's Soup Company sponsored the entire nineteen @-@ year run off Lassie . In one of the first instances of product placement , the company asked that their products be visible on the set and so , in episode after episode , Campbell 's products are seen in background shots . Campbell 's also contractually required the show 's stars to avoid appearing in any film or theatrical production that undermined their All @-@ American images . 
 In 1956 , the company held a " Name Lassie 's Puppies " contest with the grand prizes being Lassie 's pups and $ 2 @,@ 000 . Company executives hand @-@ delivered puppies to the winner 's homes . In 1958 , for twenty @-@ five cents and a label from a Swanson 's frozen dinner , viewers could receive a Lassie portrait friendship ring based on one Uncle Petrie fashions for Timmy . The company mailed 77 @,@ 715 rings to viewers . In 1959 , the company offered a wallet " made of rich brown plastic " emblazoned with a picture of Lassie ; 1 @,@ 343 @,@ 509 wallets were mailed to viewers who sent in five different labels from Campbell products . The labels represented 6 @.@ 5 million cans of Campbell 's products sold . Campbell 's paid the Wrather Company $ 7 million a year to air its commercials . The soup company 's profits rose seventy percent over its pre @-@ Lassie days . 
 Lassie was <unk> for Recipe Dog Food , a Campbell 's product introduced in 1969 , which was reportedly based on the homemade stew mixture Weatherwax prepared for Lassie . Printed advertisements for the product announced , " Now all dogs can come home to the dinner Lassie comes home to . " In its first year , Recipe earned $ 10 million for Campbell 's , and , in its third year , $ 40 million . To help boost sales , Campbell 's paid Weatherwax to write a dog @-@ training manual called The Lassie Method which the company used as a premium offer . 
 = = Plot and themes = = 
 Plots during the first ten " boy and his dog " seasons were similar : the boy ( Jeff or Timmy ) got into some sort of trouble . Lassie then dashed off to get help or rushed in to save her master 's life herself . After being reunited with family and breathing a sigh of relief , the boy received a light lecture on why he should not have done what he had done . In 2004 , June Lockhart described the show as " ... a fairy tale about people on a farm in which the dog solves all the problems in 22 minutes , in time for the last commercial . " 
 Two Timmy and Lassie episodes launched Campbell 's Soup premiums , while two others promoted a UNICEF Halloween project and the Peace Patrol , a children 's savings bond program spearheaded by Lassie and The Lone Ranger . The same seasons saw several Christmas episodes , while conservation and environmentalism were brought center stage . Some scripts dealt with race and ethnicity with both Jeff and Timmy championing Hispanics , Native Americans , and Asian Americans . Aging Americans were presented in a positive light during the years when Andy Clyde was featured as Martin family friend / neighbor Cully Wilson . 
 Seasons 11 @-@ 16 were the " Ranger years " of the series , as Lassie ( due to not being able to travel to Australia with the Martins after Paul had gotten a job offer to teach agriculture there ) was taken in by U.S. Forest Ranger Corey Stuart ( who appeared in a few episodes of season 10 ) and began to work with the U.S. Forest Service . Color filming was exploited during the Ranger years with Lassie and her friends sent to exotic locations such as Sequoia National Forest and Monument Valley , creating miniature travelogues for viewers . Other rangers would be featured during the latter part of this era when Robert Bray ( who played Stuart ) left the series . 
 For season 17 , the program shifted gears again and became somewhat of an anthology series , with Lassie traveling on her own , getting into to different adventures each week ( similar in format to The Littlest Hobo ) . No explanation was given as to why Lassie was no longer with the Forest Service . Some episodes during this final CBS season were animals @-@ only . 
 During seasons 18 and 19 ( with the series having moved to first run syndication ) , Lassie was taken in by Garth Holden ( played by Ron Hayes ) who was in charge of the Holden Ranch – a home for orphaned boys – which he ran with his college @-@ age son and his friend . This became Lassie 's home for the final two years of the series . 
 Lassie themes explored the relationship between boys and their dogs with the show helping to shape the viewer 's understanding of mid @-@ twentieth century American boyhood . Lassie was associated with the wholesome family values of its period but some parents ' groups monitoring television content found cliffhanger plots showing children in danger too intense for very young viewers and objected to some of Timmy 's actions which were believed to encourage children to disobey parents . However , Lassie was consistently depicted as caring , nurturing , and responsible with a commitment to family and community , often rescuing those in peril and righting wrongs . She was the perfect ' mother ' within the American ideology of the 1950s and 1960s .

 = Colonel Sun = 
 Colonel Sun is a novel by Kingsley Amis published by Jonathan Cape on 28 March 1968 under the pseudonym " Robert Markham " . Colonel Sun is the first James Bond continuation novel published after Ian Fleming 's 1964 death . Before writing the novel , Amis wrote two other Bond related works , the literary study The James Bond Dossier and the humorous The Book of Bond . Colonel Sun centres on the fictional British Secret Service operative James Bond and his mission to track down the kidnappers of M , his superior at the Secret Service . During the mission he discovers a communist Chinese plot to cause an international incident . Bond , assisted by a Greek spy working for the Russians , finds M on a small Aegean island , rescues him and kills the two main plotters : Colonel Sun Liang @-@ tan and a former Nazi commander , Von Richter . 
 Amis drew upon a holiday he had taken in the Greek islands to create a realistic Greek setting and characters . He emphasised political intrigue in the plot more than Fleming had done in the canonical Bond novels , also adding revenge to Bond 's motivations by including M 's kidnapping . Despite keeping a format and structure similar to Fleming 's Bond novels , Colonel Sun was given mixed reviews . 
 Colonel Sun was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper in 1968 and adapted as a comic strip in the same newspaper in 1969 – 1970 . Elements from the story have been used in the Eon Productions Bond series : The 1999 instalment The World Is Not Enough used M 's kidnapping , whilst the villain of 2002 film Die Another Day , Colonel Tan @-@ Sun Moon , owes his name to Colonel Sun Liang @-@ tan . Chapter 19 ( ' The Theory and Practice of Torture ' ) was adapted for the torture scene in Spectre ( 2015 ) . Though Blofeld replaced Sun as Bond 's tormentor , much of Blofeld 's dialogue in the scene was written by Amis for Sun , resulting in an acknowledgement to Amis ' estate in the end title credits , though no mention of the book itself . 
 = = Plot = = 
 <unk> violently take the Secret Service chief M from his house and almost capture James Bond , who is visiting . Intent on rescuing M , Bond follows the clues to <unk> , one of the Aegean Islands . In the process , Bond discovers the complex military @-@ political plans of Colonel Sun of the Chinese People 's Liberation Army . Sun had been sent to sabotage a Middle East détente conference which the Soviet Union is hosting . He intends to attack the conference venue and use M and Bond 's bodies to blame Great Britain for the disaster , leading to a world war . Bond meets Soviet agents in Athens and they realise that not only is a third country behind the kidnap , but that there is a traitor in the organisation . An attack on the Soviet headquarters kills all the agents except Ariadne Alexandrou , a Greek Communist . As he is dying , the Soviet leader encourages Bond and Ariadne to work together to prevent an international incident . 
 Ariadne persuades <unk> , a former Second World War resistance fighter and friend of her late father to help them by telling him about the involvement in the plot of former Nazi , Von Richter . Trying to find M and Colonel Sun , Bond is nearly captured by the Russians , but is saved by <unk> . Finally , Bond finds Sun 's headquarters , but is knocked out by one of Sun 's men ; Bond learns that Von Richter will use a mortar to destroy the conference venue and that Bond will be tortured by Sun , before his inevitable demise . Sun tortures him brutally , until one of the girls at the house is ordered by Sun to caress Bond fondly . In the process she cuts one of Bond 's hands free and provides him with a knife . She tells Sun that Bond is dead : when examined Bond stabs Sun . He then frees other captives who help Bond stop Von Richter . However Sun survives the stab wound and kills several of the other escapees . Bond tracks down Sun and kills him in the confrontation . The Soviets thank Bond for saving their conference , offering him a medal for his work , which he politely turns down . 
 = = Characters and themes = = 
 The main character of the novel is James Bond . Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson described Amis 's Bond as a humourless interpretation of the character that Fleming used in his earlier novels . Benson describes this personality as a natural continuation of the Bond developed in the final three Fleming novels . In all three novels , the events take a toll on Bond : he loses his wife in On Her Majesty 's Secret Service ; he loses his memory in Japan in You Only Live Twice ; and he is brainwashed in Russia , is de @-@ programmed by MI6 and almost dies from Francisco Scaramanga 's poisoned bullet in The Man with the Golden Gun . Benson identifies Bond 's desire for revenge as a central theme to the novel . The plot centres on Bond 's need to avenge the death of the Hammonds and M 's kidnapping . Benson describes this as particularly striking : " Bond is particularly brutal in achieving his goal ... The revenge is very satisfying . This is Bond at his toughest . " 
 Benson considered that M 's character evokes an emotional response from the reader because of the change from his usual , business like @-@ manner to a semi @-@ catatonic state upon being kidnapped . However , Amis envisaged something different for the character : he did not like M and , as one reviewer pointed out that in The James Bond Dossier , he had " spent a chapter running him down . " The main villain of the novel is Colonel Sun Liang @-@ tan . Sun is a member of the Special Activities Committee of the Chinese People 's Liberation Army as well as a sadist and skilled torturer . Raymond Benson called him " very worthy of inclusion in the Bond saga " . 
 Raymond Benson notes increased political intrigue in the novel compared to earlier Bond novels . In Colonel Sun , Bond acts in concert with the Russians against the Chinese , which demonstrates one of the main themes of the book : a peacekeeping between nations . Military historian Jeremy Black describes the novel reflecting a shift in the balance of world power away from two party Cold War politics . To accentuate this idea of Oriental threat , the novel demonstrates a disregard by the Chinese for human life , a position similar to the treatment of the East in Fleming 's Dr. No . Black also notes an emotional and social sadness throughout Colonel Sun . The social sadness is a reaction to the culture of modernity and mourning what was being lost in its place . This treatment by Amis is similar to Fleming 's nostalgia in describing Paris in " From a View to a Kill " . 
 = = Background = = 
 The original creator of James Bond , Ian Fleming , died in the early morning of 12 August 1964 , eight months before the posthumous publication of The Man with the Golden Gun . After his death , Glidrose Productions ( now Ian Fleming Publications ) held the rights to Fleming 's works . The company decided to publish two short stories , " Octopussy " and " The Living Daylights " , on 23 June 1966 . 
 As the Bond character could not be copyrighted , and to retain rights in the Bond product , Glidrose decided to commission a sequel . Initially the company approached author James <unk> to write a continuation novel , but he declined . Glidrose then commissioned Amis , who wrote Colonel Sun . Critic and future novelist Sally Beauman noted that it was " unusual , not to say unprecedented , for an established author to pick up the torch in this way , " though she admits that " Bond [ is ] too big , and too profitable , a property to be placed in the hands of an unknown . " 
 Fleming 's wife , Ann , did not endorse any further Bond works and disliked Amis , saying that he would create " a petit bourgeois red brick Bond " . 
 In 1965 , Amis produced The James Bond Dossier — a critical analysis of the Bond books under his own name — and The Book of Bond , a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek manual for prospective agents , using the pseudonym Lt.-Col. William ( " Bill " ) Tanner . Amis followed these books with the 1966 novel , The Anti @-@ Death League which had a plot filled with popular fiction elements and helped Amis prepare for Colonel Sun . 
 Amis and his wife Jane spent September 1965 holidaying on the Greek island of Spetses and Amis used his experiences as the background to the novel . Amis followed a tradition set by Fleming of using the names of people he knew or had met during the researches for his book and Amis drew on the names of people he met in Greece for Colonel Sun . The boat Bond uses — The Altair — was the name of the boat Amis and his wife used on holiday , whilst the Bond girl 's fictitious colleagues , " <unk> " and " <unk> " were friends who helped Amis in Greece , whilst the doctor who treats Bond in Chapter two was named after Amis and Jane 's own doctor . 
 In a 21 May 1967 letter to Philip Larkin , Amis mentioned that he had already finished writing the Bond novel . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Jonathan Cape published Colonel Sun on 28 March 1968 ; the book was 255 pages long and priced at a guinea . The novel sold well – journalist and author Eric Hiscock claims that by 1980 it had sold over 500 @,@ 000 copies worldwide – and was listed second best seller in the " Books in demand " list of the Financial Times for March and April 1968 . Harper & Row published the novel in the US on 1 May 1968 ; the United States edition ran to 244 pages . 
 = = = Reviews = = = 
 Colonel Sun was broadly welcomed by the critics , although a number noted that despite Amis 's abilities as a writer , Fleming 's own persona was missing from the novel . Roger Baker , writing in The Times noted that from one angle Colonel Sun is a " neat , not over @-@ inventive thriller , low on sex , high on violence and more than usually improbable " ; however , he noted that once the elements of the re @-@ incarnation of Bond and the writing of Kingsley Amis were taken into account , things were different . Baker thought that with Amis writing the story , " one might , justifiably , have expected a joyous rejuvenation or at least a devastating detour from the Fleming pattern . We get neither . It is a pale copy . " D. J. Enright , writing in The Listener , considered that , in literary terms , Fleming 's " inheritance has been well and aptly bestowed . " He said that " Colonel Sun offers apt literary <unk> for Bond 's fish @-@ and @-@ chip culture , for his neurotics , alcoholics and suicides . Good dirty fun , once read and soon forgotten " . 
 Writing in The Times Literary Supplement , Simon Gray , unimpressed with the novel , called the Bond in Colonel Sun " a chuckle @-@ headed imposter whose arthritic thought processes would be a liability in a ' physical tussle ' down at the pub . " He went on to comment that the novel only " offers the frustrated Bond addict ... a small academic problem , of swiftly passing interest . " The Daily Mirror 's reviewer , Alexander Muir considered the book to be " an exciting , violent , sadistic and sexy piece of reading matter " , although , partly because of Amis ' abilities as a writer , Colonel Sun " is altogether too meticulous and well written – Fleming was a hypnotic but slapdash writer . And , at times , I sensed parody . This could be fatal . " 
 Writing in The Guardian , Malcolm Bradbury called the novel " a reasonable read but no more : neither vintage Fleming nor vintage Amis . " Bradbury also noted that " it lacks a convincing rhetoric ... and the traditional Fleming <unk> emerge only in muted form . " Maurice Richardson , reviewing Colonel Sun for The Observer , wrote that when being judged as a thriller , the novel " is vigorous , quite exciting , rather disorderly , a bit laboured " . He went on to say that " Some of the action is quite well done and little more preposterous than in the later Flemings . The real trouble is the absence of spontaneous élan . 
 The reviewer for the Los Angeles Times , Charles Champlin , noted that the novel " lacks the garish , outrageous , ridiculous , symbol @-@ witted touch of the original article " ; despite that , he still enjoyed the novel , commenting that it left " intact the reputations of both Messrs. Amis and Fleming . " Donald Stanley , writing in Life magazine praised the villain Sun , saying he " is the kind of villain to make a <unk> salivate . " In general Stanley praised Amis for emulating " the celebrated Fleming Effect " . Stanley is less convinced with Bond , observing that his " essential <unk> is being replaced by some kind of dilute humanism " . 
 The reviewer for The New York Times noted the reduced numbers of gadgets employed in the book , when compared with the films , that they felt had " overshadowed the personality of the secret agent " ; overall the reviewer felt that " Mr. Amis has now given Bond back to the readers . " Oberbeck commented that Bond " has become a sensitive man @-@ of @-@ ethics who suffers pangs of doubt and remorse over the ' senseless ' violence of his profession " . Oberbeck went on to say that Amis " never quite captures the <unk> beat of a Fleming pace " ; most telling , according to Oberbeck , was that " the greatest flaw in Amis ' conception of Bond is that he has attempted to transform the consummate spy @-@ hero into something he was never meant to have been : a man with a job " . 
 Sally Beauman writing for New York believed that " Amis has all the obvious ingredients for success " including " an exotic troubled international setting , a beautiful girl , frequent <unk> , and even more frequent killings ; and , most imperative , a villain . Yet the book drags and becomes a bore . " Beauman complains that the story lacks suspense and that Bond is far too gloomy : he 's more like Ingmar Bergman 's creations than Ian Fleming 's hero . Beauman attributes the novel 's failure to the " differing characters of the authors . "

 = Parallels ( Star Trek : The Next Generation ) = 
 " Parallels " is the 11th episode of the seventh season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : The Next Generation , the 163rd overall . It was originally released on November 29 , 1993 , in broadcast syndication . The episode was written by Brannon Braga , and directed by Robert Wiemer . Executive producer Jeri Taylor wrote the final scene of the episode , but was uncredited . 
 Set in the 24th century , the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Federation starship Enterprise . In this episode , Lt. Worf ( Michael Dorn ) returns from a bat 'leth tournament and slowly discovers that he is being moved across parallel universes . The crew of an alternative Enterprise realise what is happening and seek to return him to his own reality , but , after an attack by a Bajoran ship , a space @-@ time fissure explodes , causing hundreds of thousands of alternative versions of the Enterprise to enter the same universe . After Worf reverses the course through the fissure , he and all the versions of the Enterprise are returned to their respective universes . 
 Braga intended to focus the " Parallels " on Jean @-@ Luc Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) , but this was changed to Worf . The change was made in order to make the differences more obvious across the timelines , as Braga worried that Picard 's relationships could not significantly differ across near @-@ universes . The producers were concerned with the confusing nature of the initial proposal , but felt that further changes greatly improved it . Wil Wheaton appeared as Wesley Crusher , replacing the initial plan to include Tasha Yar , after Braga was concerned about copying " Yesterday 's Enterprise " . " Parallels " received Nielsen ratings of 12 @.@ 8 percent , one of the highest for the season , but some fans were upset at a Worf / Deanna Troi romance . Critics responded favorably to the episode , with praise directed at both Dorn and Marina Sirtis . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After competing in a bat 'leth tournament on the planet Forcas III , Lieutenant Worf returns to the Enterprise and is treated to a surprise birthday party , much to his annoyance . As he attends the party , he starts to notice subtle changes , such as the flavor of the cake changing , and a painting given to him by Data appearing on a different wall . The changes start to become more pronounced ; as a Cardassian vessel attacks the Enterprise , unfamiliar controls result in Worf failing to raise the shields , leading to the death of Geordi La Forge . Despite retaining his initial memories , Worf has no evidence that reality has changed , and his own personal logs support the stories given by the other crew members . Other major changes occur : Riker is Captain of the Enterprise in a reality wherein Picard was killed by the Borg , the Bajorans became the oppressors of the Cardassians and enemies of the Federation , Wesley Crusher is a lieutenant on the Enterprise , Alyssa Ogawa is the Chief Medical Officer , and Worf finds himself married to Deanna Troi . 
 Upon investigation , the crew find that Worf 's RNA has an unusual quantum signature and confirm that he is from a different universe . The crew theorizes that Worf , on his original return from the bat 'leth tournament , passed through a time @-@ space fissure , with the shuttlecraft 's engines causing Worf to quantum flux between several parallel universes . Data determines that Worf 's proximity to La Forge 's <unk> caused Worf to shift between universes , and that each universe covers a different possibility . In effect , anything that could possibly happen has done so in a parallel universe , hence the believable changes in the reality that Worf is experiencing . The Enterprise returns to the location of the fissure , attempting to return Worf to his original universe . The Enterprise is then attacked by a Bajoran ship , which causes the fissure to destabilize and the various realities to merge , resulting in over 285 @,@ 000 versions of the Enterprise appearing in the same area of space . 
 Data determines that the only way to restore the realities is to send Worf via shuttlecraft to the Enterprise of his universe , passing through the fissure and using the shuttlecraft 's engines to <unk> it . After locating the correct ship , Worf begins to travel back but is attacked by another Enterprise that has come from a Borg @-@ overrun universe , its crew refusing to return . The Enterprise that he left fires upon the hostile ship and destroys it . Worf safely passes through the fissure , finding himself back in normality with a single Enterprise in front of him . After boarding , Worf finds that no time has passed since he initially entered the fissure . When he returns to his room expecting a surprise party , he finds only Troi waiting to give him a single present and , knowing that the two are married in many alternate universes , he invites her to share dinner with him .

 Writer Brannon Braga initially conceived of the episode as centered on Captain Picard , rather than Worf . It was only when planning out the story that he realised that there would not be a great deal of personal differences across realities with Picard . As such , he decided to include Worf as the main character , and chose to place him in a romance with Troi as he felt that most people would not have expected it . Braga considered writing Tasha Yar into the episode , but he felt that this would have copied " Yesterday 's Enterprise " , so he replaced her with Wesley Crusher , played by Wil Wheaton . Further changes were made to the script as Braga had intended for Worf to be sung " Happy Birthday to You " in the Klingon language , but the cost for the rights to the song would have been prohibitive and so the idea was dropped . 
 Executive producer Jeri Taylor approved the initial outline but was concerned that it might be potentially confusing . She was happy with the outcome and described it as having " worked like gangbusters " . She felt that the Worf / Troi romance had been subtly played by the writers on the show since the fifth season episode " Ethics " and had been an ambition on the show since " A Fistful of Datas " in the sixth season . After being included in " Parallels " , the relation was featured several times during the final season of The Next Generation . Michael Piller was not enthused with the initial idea , but Taylor felt that the means by which it evolved saved it . 
 Braga thought in hindsight that Crusher 's appearance could have been explained more but at the time he felt it was most intriguing if he was " just there " . He also wanted to avoid suggesting that Worf was going insane , since that theme had been covered in the previous season in the episode " Frame of Mind " . Director Robert Wiemer sought to have a conclusive ending to the episode to state Worf 's future intentions . Worf 's suggestion of champagne to Troi was written by Taylor to accommodate this . 
 " Parallels " re @-@ used a number of previously seen props and costumes , including Troi 's entire uniform wardrobe with the exception of the first season outfits . Other elements such as the Argus Array ( a space station model ) had appeared in other episodes , and alternative comm badges used in the episode had been seen in the " Future Imperfect " . The space station Deep Space 5 was a re @-@ dress of Regula One from Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan . Modifications were made to the bridge set in one reality ; these would later be re @-@ used for the future Enterprise in the series finale " All Good Things ... " . The effect shot with multiple Enterprise 's was achieved by photographing the same model from multiple angles , resulting more than 100 appearing on screen , while the scene with multiple <unk> was produced through the use of split screens and stand @-@ ins . 
 This simultaneous portrayal of numerous different universes was cited by Roberto Orci , one of the screenwriters for the 2009 film Star Trek , as proof that , despite the movie 's creation of a secondary timeline , the " regular " Trek universe was unaffected and everything from The Original Series onward still went on as it had before . He said that " Parallels " was using the many @-@ worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics in which a new timeline does not overwrite a previous one , unlike previous episodes in the franchise such as " The City on the Edge of Forever " and " Yesterday 's Enterprise " . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The multiverse idea featured in " Parallels " has been discussed by commentators . Theoretical physicist Lawrence M. Krauss praised the episode for the inclusion of the idea in his book The Physics of Star Trek , although added that it incorrectly explained measurement in quantum mechanics . This quantum mechanics theory explained during the episode was called " a little sketchy " by Michelle and Duncan Barrett in their book Star Trek : The Human Factor . They based this on mathematical physicist Roger Penrose 's theory that there is no identified physics for bridging the gap between physics and quantum physics . The Barretts noted the use that the Star Trek franchise has had out of the idea of the multiverse , and different timelines . 
 = = Reception and home media release = = 
 The episode aired during the week commencing November 27 , 1993 , in broadcast syndication . According to Nielsen Media Research , it received ratings of 12 @.@ 8 percent . This means that it was watched by 12 @.@ 8 percent of all households watching television during its timeslot . This placed it as the second most watched syndicated show for that week , and it was the fourth most viewed episode of the season behind part two of " Descent " , " Eye of the Beholder " and " All Good Things ... " . Some fans were upset at the introduction of a romance between Worf and Troi , as they felt that Riker and Troi was the correct paring . Taylor said that some of the fans felt that the Riker / Troi relationship was so inevitable that the show simply should have " got it over with " and not introduced a new romance for Troi instead . 
 Zack Handlen , in his review for the A.V. Club , gave the episode a grade of A- . He said that it was a " nicely balanced " episode , and that Sirtis and Dorn had good chemistry . Handlen further praised Dorn 's comic timing . He enjoyed the image of the other versions of the Enterprise appearing in the same universe , but criticised the level of technobabble during the second half of the episode . IGN writer Scott <unk> released a podcast asking whether " Parallels " was the most underrated episode of the series . 
 Keith DeCandido gave the episode a rating of 10 out of 10 in his review for Tor.com. He expressed his love for the episode , praising the centering of " Parallels " on Worf " partly because no one does frustrated befuddlement better than Michael Dorn " . He enjoyed the increasing changes to each universe , but his highlight of the episode was the Enterprise from the Borg invasion timeline which fired on the shuttle at the end . DeCandido said that this kept the episode memorable after 19 years , and " cemented this as one of TNG 's top episodes " . In a list of the top 100 episodes of the Star Trek franchise , " Parallels " was placed in 89th place by Charlie Jane Anders at io9 . 
 The first release on home media for " Parallels " within the United States was on VHS cassette as part of a single episode release , which took place on January 1 , 2000 . " Parallels " was released on DVD in 2002 as part of the season box set . It was later released as part of the season set on Blu Ray within the United States on December 2 , 2014 . This included an audio commentary from Braga . 
 = Hurricane Nora ( 1997 ) = 
 Hurricane Nora was only the third tropical cyclone on record to reach Arizona as a tropical storm . Nora was the fourteenth named tropical cyclone and seventh hurricane of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season . The September storm formed off the Pacific coast of Mexico , and aided by waters warmed by El Niño , eventually peaked at Category 4 intensity on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . 
 Nora intensified and weakened quickly before taking an unusual path , which led it to make landfall twice as a hurricane in Baja California . After landfall , its remnants affected the Southwestern United States with tropical storm @-@ force winds , torrential rain and flooding . Nora is blamed for two direct casualties in Mexico , as well as substantial beach erosion on the Mexican coast , flash flooding in Baja California , and record precipitation in Arizona . Nora persisted far inland and eventually dissipated near the Arizona – Nevada border . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Nora formed early on September 16 , 1997 , while located 290 miles ( 460 km ) southwest of the Mexican port of Acapulco , Guerrero , from the same tropical wave that had earlier created Hurricane Erika . Due to favorable conditions associated with El Niño , the tropical disturbance quickly achieved deep convection and became well @-@ organized . By 6 a.m. UTC , the U.S. National Hurricane Center had designated the disturbance as Tropical Depression Sixteen @-@ E. Half a day later , it had gained enough strength to be named Tropical Storm Nora . 
 A high pressure area over northern Mexico forced the storm to move west @-@ northwest for the first few days . During that time , Nora kept intensifying , becoming a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale by noon UTC on September 18 . Nora slowed and became stationary for two days from September 18 . The eye vanished , and convection began to decrease . This was presumed to have happened because of a drop in sea @-@ surface temperatures . The cool waters temporarily weakened Nora 's winds to 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) down from a maximum of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . After leaving the area of cool waters , the storm began moving nearly parallel to Mexico 's western coast . There was a period of rapid intensification and the eye reappeared . Cloud tops cooled and at midday UTC on September 21 , Nora reached its peak intensity of 950 mbar ( 28 inHg ) and 135 mph ( 210 km / h ) winds , a Category 4 hurricane . The peak was brief as the cyclone encountered cool waters in the wake of Hurricane Linda , weakening the storm 's winds to 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) by September 23 and broke its eyewall . 
 Nora crossed an area of abnormally warm water near the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula . It restrengthened slightly before making its first landfall near Bahía Tortugas , Baja California Sur on September 25 . When Nora was inland , the area of the storm located in the Gulf of California began to reintensify . Hurricane Nora then made a second landfall about 60 miles ( 95 km ) south @-@ southeast of San Fernando , Baja California . Nora was one of the few hurricanes to make landfall in Northern Baja . 
 At landfall , a trough was accelerating Nora northwards , causing it to reach a forward speed of 30 mph ( 50 km / h ) . Late on September 25 ( UTC ) , still a tropical storm , it entered the continental United States at the California @-@ Arizona state line . Nora began to weaken rapidly , and was downgraded to a tropical depression three hours later , while located between Blythe and Needles , California . Nora reached Arizona while still tropical , becoming the third known system to do so . Nora degenerated over land , and the low @-@ level center moved towards the north @-@ northeast . A remnant circulation aloft persisted , however , and was likely responsible for a period of near hurricane @-@ force winds observed at the NWS Cedar City , Utah Doppler weather radar . The remnants gradually became more diffuse over the following two days while moving generally northeastward , through portions of Utah , Colorado , Idaho and Wyoming . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 While Nora stayed off the Pacific coast of Mexico , the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional ( National Meteorological Service ) issued a hurricane watch for the coast between Lázaro Cárdenas , Michoacán , and Puerto Vallarta , Jalisco , and several major ports in the shoreline closed to navigation . As the storm moved away from the mainland coast and towards the Baja California Peninsula , about 500 people were evacuated from their homes near Cabo San Lucas , Baja California Sur , and placed in shelters to prepare for the storm 's impact . At the same time , in Sonora , another 50 were evacuated from a fishing camp in Guaymas . Meanwhile , the SMN issued tropical storm warnings along the Baja California coast , as well as hurricane watches and warnings around the entire Gulf of California between Santa Rosalía , Baja California Sur , and Bahía Kino , Sonora . 
 On September 24 , Arizona Governor Jane Dee Hull activated an emergency response center to prepare the state 's response to the flash flooding the storm would cause on the dry desert floor , and Yuma residents began to fill approximately 55 @,@ 000 sandbags to contain the possible flooding . Hull also activated the state 's National Guard , and sent drinking water and electric generators to Yuma . Further inland , the National Weather Service issued flash flood watches for western Arizona , southeastern California , southwestern Colorado , southern Nevada and southern Utah on September 26 . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Hurricane Nora caused two direct deaths in Mexico and three or four indirect fatalities in the United States . Although the total cost of damage is not known , Nora caused up to several hundred millions of dollars of damage . The system also dropped heavy rain in the United States and Mexico , which caused flooding and power outages . 
 = = = Mexico = = = 
 Nora killed two in Mexico : an electrocution by a downed power line in Mexicali , Baja California , and a diver caught in strong underwater currents created by Nora off the coast of the San Quintin Valley . 
 Although Nora 's center of circulation remained well offshore from southwestern mainland Mexico , the Associated Press reported that waves up to 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) hit that coastline , destroying dozens of homes . Nora 's winds also produced rough seas and high waves , which caused substantial beach erosion , particularly around Acapulco , where the Pie de la Cuesta beaches were washed away . In the states of Guerrero and Jalisco , Nora brought down trees and washed away the foundations of homes , although no injuries were reported there . 
 Heavy rains also fell along the storm 's northeast periphery , with the highest amounts of 20 @.@ 94 inches ( 532 mm ) falling at La Cruz / Elota and 16 @.@ 79 inches ( 426 mm ) being measured at <unk> / Loreto . About 350 – 400 people were left homeless by floodwaters in the town of Arroyo de Santa Catarina in northern Baja California . Heavy damage and flooding was reported in San Felipe , on the northwestern shore of the Gulf of California , as well as extensive beach erosion . Local roads and highways were destroyed and the town 's dock was severely damaged . On the northeastern shore , at Puerto Peñasco , Nora blew down trees , billboards , electric wires , taco stands , and ripped sheet @-@ metal from homes . Waves of 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) were reported there . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 In the United States , there were no direct deaths blamed on the hurricane . However , the California Highway Patrol attributed three or four traffic fatalities in southern California to the weather . 
 Damage totals in the United States are not fully known , although media summaries of Nora included a loss to agriculture preliminarily estimated at several hundred million dollars , and at least one study places the figure at $ 150 – 200 million ( 1997 USD ) . It is estimated that $ 30 – 40 million ( 1997 USD ) in damage to lemon trees occurred . Although Nora was significantly weakened , near hurricane @-@ force winds were observed at the Dixie National Forest in southwestern Utah , where strong gusts sheared off the tops of large trees . 
 The Yuma radar indicated a small area of 10 inches ( 250 mm ) rainfall totals along the northern Gulf of California coast of Baja California . In the United States , the largest total rainfall was recorded at the <unk> Mountains in Arizona , where 11 @.@ 97 inches ( 304 mm ) of rainfall were recorded as a result of Nora , causing flash floods in western Arizona . 
 Near Phoenix , rainfall from the storm caused the Narrows Dam , a small earthen dam , to fail . In other locations in Arizona , California , Nevada , and Utah , more than 3 inches ( 76 mm ) occurred in a few localized areas , sometimes with precipitation comparable to the entire local yearly average rainfall . Flooding was also reported in Somerton , San Diego , El Centro , Palm Springs and Indio , while 12 @,@ 000 people lost power in Yuma , as well as Los Angeles and southwestern Utah .

 = Spongiforma squarepantsii = 
 Spongiforma squarepantsii is a species of fungus in the Boletaceae family , genus Spongiforma . Found in Malaysia , it was described as new to science in 2011 . It produces sponge @-@ like , rubbery orange fruit bodies that have a fruity or musky odour . The fruit bodies reach dimensions of 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) wide by 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) tall . Like a sponge , they will resume their original shape if water is squeezed out . The spores , produced on the surfaces of the hollows of the sponge , are almond @-@ shaped with rough surfaces , and measure 10 – 12 @.@ 5 by 6 – 7 micrometers . The name of the fungus is derived from the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants . S. squarepantsii is one of two species in Spongiforma ; it differs from S. thailandica in its colour , odour , and spore structure . 
 = = Taxonomy and classification = = 
 The species was first described scientifically online in May 2011 in the journal Mycologia , authored by American mycologists Dennis E. Desjardin , Kabir Peay , and Thomas Bruns . The description was based on two specimens collected by Bruns in 2010 in Lambir Hills National Park , in Sarawak , Malaysia . The species had first appeared in the literature in 2010 in a study of the ectomycorrhizal mushrooms in a tropical dipterocarp rainforest in Lambir Hills , although it was not formally described in this publication . Because of its unusual form , Desjardin and colleagues were initially uncertain whether the new species was a member of the Basidiomycota or the Ascomycota . Further analysis showed that the species was aligned with Spongiforma , a genus that was newly described from dipterocarp forests of Thailand in 2009 . The similarity between the species collected in Borneo and Spongiforma thailandica was confirmed with molecular analysis , which showed a 98 % match between ribosomal DNA sequences of the two . 
 The genus name Spongiforma refers to the sponge @-@ like nature of the fruit body , while the specific epithet squarepantsii is a Latinisation of the well @-@ known cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants , whose shape shares a resemblance to the fungus . Additionally , the authors note that the spore @-@ bearing surface ( the hymenium ) , when viewed with scanning electron microscopy , somewhat resembles a " seafloor covered with tube sponges , reminiscent of the fictitious home of SpongeBob " . Although the epithet was originally rejected by the editors of Mycologia as " frivolous " , Desjardin and colleagues insisted that " we could name it whatever we liked " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit body of Spongiforma squarepantsii is bright orange coloured , roughly spherical to oval , and measures 3 – 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) wide by 2 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) tall . Although it lacks a stipe , it has a rudimentary columella — a small cord of sterile tissue that extends to the center of the fruit body . The surface of the fruit body has deep ridges and folds somewhat resembling a brain . It is sponge @-@ like and rubbery — if water is squeezed out , it will resume its original shape . The surface has irregular , relatively large cavities ( locules ) , lined with fertile ( spore @-@ producing ) tissue . The locules are between 2 and 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 1 and 0 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter . The ridges of the locules are pale orange or lighter and ciliate ( having hairlike projections ) . Fruit bodies have a strong odour described as " vaguely fruity or strongly musty " . The mushroom tissue turns purple when a drop of 3 % potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) is applied . In mass , the spores are a reddish @-@ brown or deep mahogany colour . The edibility of the fruit body is unknown . 
 The almond @-@ shaped spores are typically 10 – 12 @.@ 5 by 6 – 7 μm with thick walls measuring between 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 2 μm . They have a small central apiculus ( a depressed area when the spore was once attached to the basidium via the sterigma ) . When mounted in distilled water , they have a coarsely warty surface and appear rusty brown in colour . When mounted in a 3 % KOH solution , the spores are pale lilac grey , and the surface ornamentation forms swollen pustules that loosen and dissolve . Spores are dextrinoid ( meaning they turn reddish @-@ brown when stained with Melzer 's reagent ) and cyanophilic ( red in acetocarmine ) . The basidia are club @-@ shaped , and four @-@ spored with sterigmata up to 9 @.@ 5 μm long . The ridges of the locules comprise erect cystidia mixed with chains of erect cylindrical hyphae measuring 4 – 6 μm in diameter . The cystidia are roughly cylindrical , and have dimensions of 20 – 60 by 4 – 9 μm . There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae of the fungus . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 The related species Spongiforma thailandica , newly described in 2009 , differs from S. squarepantsii in several ways : it has larger fruit bodies , 5 – 10 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) wide by 4 – 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 8 in ) tall ; its gleba is initially pale greyish @-@ orange to brownish @-@ grey before darkening to reddish @-@ brown or dark brown ; and it smells of coal tar . Microscopically , S. thailandica has spores with less prominent surface warts . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Spongiforma squarepantsii was found growing on the ground in Lambir Hills National Park ( Sarawak State , Malaysia ) , northern Borneo ( 4 ° 20 ′ N 113 ° 50 ′ E ) . This tropical rainforest receives about 3 @,@ 000 millimetres ( 120 in ) of rain yearly , with average temperatures ranging from 24 to 32 ° C ( 75 to 90 ° F ) . The structure of the fruit body allows it to quickly revive when dry by absorbing moisture from the air . The distinctive odour of the species may indicate that spore dispersal is mediated by animals . 
 = Deckham = 
 Deckham is a residential suburb in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead in Tyne and Wear , England . It is bordered by Gateshead to the north , Sheriff Hill to the south , Felling and Carr Hill to the east and Shipcote to the west . It lies on the B1296 , the route of the old Great North Road , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south of Gateshead town centre , 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) south of Newcastle @-@ upon @-@ Tyne and 13 miles ( 21 km ) north of the city of Durham . In 2011 , Deckham had a population of 9 @,@ 938 . 
 Deckham 's history is sparsely documented but suggests that the settlement was established at the junction of Carr Hill Road and the Old Durham Road in the early 19th century alongside the estate of Deckham Hall , built several centuries earlier and inhabited at one time by Thomas Deckham . The village grew , and at the turn of the 20th century was enveloped by urban <unk> when neighbouring Gateshead absorbed its outlying villages and settlements . Deckham is largely distinguished from other areas by a commercial area on Old Durham Road which is the principal route through the suburb . Historically , Deckham was a village in County Durham and was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead by the Local Government Act 1972 . 
 Deckham has steep topography which has shaped the character of the suburb . Residents can enjoy striking views towards Newcastle upon Tyne and across the Team Valley . The settlement is governed locally by a Parliamentary Labour council and elects a Labour MP . 
 Deckham is an area of social and economic deprivation , in the top ten per cent of such areas according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation . Housing stock is predominantly council housing and is , in many places , outdated and in need of modernisation . Whilst once the site of a coal mine , there is today no major employer in Deckham , which is considered a residential suburb of Gateshead . The main economic activity is in a commercial development on Old Durham Road . Deckham has a number of public houses , one of which , the Plough Inn , is more than 150 years old . The only education provision is at South Street Primary School , which is a good school according to OFSTED . There are two churches , one of which , the Church of St George , is a Grade II listed building , and community facilities are provided by Deckham Community Centre and the Elgin Centre in Carr Hill .

It indicates that , by the middle of the 19th century , there was a small settlement which was part of Gateshead Fell ; a wild and treacherous area of common land notable for the criminality of the tinkers and hawkers who lived there . Ordnance survey mapping illustrates the sparsity of buildings in 1860 ; the area contained little except Deckham Hall , a few other dwellings and two public houses at the point where the old turnpike road branched off towards Carr 's Hill . The two public houses were the ' Speed the Plough ' and ' The Ship ' . 
 The Deckham Hall estate was on the east side of Old Durham Road , 1 @.@ 25 miles from the Tyne Bridge . It is evidenced in 1614 and belonged to Thomas Deckham , who died the same year and bequeathed it to his granddaughter with " three pounds for the bringing home of water " to the poor people of the area . It changed hands regularly between the families Wooler , James and Bowker , in the centuries after Deckham 's death and varied in size whilst doing so . Alderman Benjamin Biggar , Mayor of Gateshead 1861 – 2 , is thought to have lived at Deckham Hall . 
 By the turn of the 20th century Deckham 's rural aspect had changed . Whilst there remained large areas of grass and woodland between Deckham and Gateshead , there was a period of extensive building ; several dozen dwellings were erected by 1895 in the Mount Pleasant area as Gateshead expanded southwards . A public house was built at the junction of Taylor Terrace and Split Crow Road . Two years later , a tract of Tyneside flats was built on the west side of the Old Durham Road and many streets in the area , such as Chandos Street , Shipcote Terrace , Raby Street and <unk> Street , are evidenced , along with an unnamed school . By 1919 , some rural scenes could still be enjoyed but the fields were " rapidly encroached upon " in the 1920s and 1930s and replaced with more terraced housing at Caris Street , Fullerton Place and Methuen Street and large tracts of council houses . By this time , Deckham Hall was in a state of disrepair and was notable to residents for its resemblance to a haunted house " because of its air of gloom and the strange echoes to be heard on windy nights " . The hall was demolished in 1930 and more council houses were erected on the site . 
 Since the intensive period of house building , little has changed . At the west end of the suburb , the Tyneside flats at <unk> Street and surrounding streets remain in situ and here there is " housing and little else " . Much of this housing is in poor condition , some is in " crumbling disrepair " and requires substantial investment . Old Durham Road has developed into the focal point of the neighbourhood and is the sole commercial area , with small , independent shops running along the western end of the road backing onto the streets from Inskip Terrace and Shipcote Terrace . Whilst many retail units are in a state of deterioration , and despite a report describing recent housing development on the east side of Old Durham Road as " poorly handled and unsightly " , the area remains " interesting and lively " . By contrast , the central and eastern areas of Deckham are affected by a more marked decline . At the western edge there are stone remnants of an old , rural settlement , but the remainder , grouped around <unk> and Kingston Roads , consists of bland , repetitive social housing arranged on long , curved streets which combine to create an environment which is anonymous , claustrophobic and disorientating . One source describes the environment as one where " <unk> become landmarks ( lock – up workshops on Kingston Road ) , any slight change in materials becomes significant ( system – built housing on Kingston Road ) , and any attempt to do something different becomes a relief ( a corner garden on Mayfair Gardens ) " . 
 The net result is that , in Deckham today : 
 There is something of a sense of isolation in parts of Deckham , especially further up the hill as development densities drop , commercial and social facilities disappear and activity levels on the street fall away . Around the Old Durham Road the surviving mix of small shops and meeting places generate some impression of communal spirit , but the poor condition of many properties and the dominance of the public realm by traffic serve to stunt it . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Unlike Sheriff Hill , Deckham was not founded on heavy industry . It developed primarily for its ease of access to the turnpike road , the principle route between Durham and Newcastle @-@ upon @-@ Tyne which ran through it . There is evidence of coal mining ; the Durham Mining Museum has a record for ' Deckham Hall Colliery ' . Few records of the colliery survive , and it is difficult to ascertain when it opened , but the colliery was located 1 @.@ 5 miles south from Newcastle and was in the hands of Hopper , Hughes and Company in 1886 . By December 1893 the colliery had been abandoned as being " not workable to a profit " . 
 In common with most suburbs of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead , its economy is dominated by the economies of Newcastle – upon – Tyne and Gateshead town centre . This is reflected in terms of independent commercial space ; retail floor space in the suburb totals 1 % of that available in the whole metropolitan borough . There are 33 retail units concentrated on Old Durham Road , which provide some employment , though these are at the lower end of the spectrum and provide little choice . There is a good provision of hardware stores , fast – food outlets and hairdressers , a butcher 's shop , a greengrocer and a supermarket , but there is no bakery , bank nor building society and the Post Office has closed . The retail units were domestic properties , so many are too small for retail purposes and around 20 % are vacant . 
 Deckham suffers from high levels of unemployment ; in 2011 the mean percentage of the population claiming Jobseekers Allowance was 7 % . This compares to Gateshead 's 5 % average over the same period . Youth unemployment is 10 % , compared to Gateshead 's 9 % . 
 = = Geography and topography = = 
 Deckham , at latitude 54 @.@ 95 ° N and longitude 1 @.@ 59 ° W , lies less than 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south and east of Gateshead town centre between two main transport corridors ; Sunderland Road to the east and Old Durham Road to the west . The distance from Deckham to London is 255 miles ( 410 km ) . Deckham occupies an elevated position , especially at its north end which sits on a ridge , and some parts are steeply sloped – notably those which border Sheriff Hill to the south . 
 In the urban expansion of Gateshead , Deckham was enveloped so that its exact boundaries are difficult to define . The estate had boundaries at Split Crow Road , Old Durham Road , Hendon Road and Carr Hill Road but documents indicate that Deckham stretches to Durham Road in the west and the streets adjoining Hendon Road as far north as the <unk> open space at Mount Pleasant . In 1974 Deckham was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead by the Local Government Act 1972 . Until its implementation , Deckham was part of County Durham . It is now bordered by settlements which are part of the metropolitan borough . These are Sheriff Hill to the south , Low Fell and Shipcote to the west , Gateshead to the north and Felling and Carr Hill to the east . 
 Deckham has distinctive , steep topography which " shapes the character " of the suburb . Though the urbanisation of Gateshead has detracted from panoramic views that were once enjoyed by residents , the topography ensures that residents continue to have excellent views towards Newcastle @-@ upon @-@ Tyne and the Team Valley .

 Deckham is a council ward in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead . It is approximately 1 @.@ 5 square kilometres ( 0 @.@ 58 sq mi ) in area and has a population of 9 @,@ 228 . It is represented by three councillors . In June 2012 , they were Brian Coates , Martin Gannon and Bernadette Oliphant . 
 Deckham is part of the Westminster parliamentary constituency of Gateshead . It was previously in the Gateshead East and Washington West constituency which was abolished by boundary changes before the 2010 UK General Election . For many years the MP was Joyce Quin , who retired on 11 April 2005 and was awarded a life peerage into the House of Lords on 13 June 2006 and is now Baroness Quin . 
 The present MP Ian Mearns , is a member of the Labour party and his office is in Gateshead . He replaced Sharon Hodgson who successfully campaigned in the newly formed constituency of Washington and Sunderland West . In the 2010 UK General Election , Mearns was elected with a majority of 12 @,@ 549 over Frank Hindle . The swing from Labour to the Liberal Democrats was 3 @.@ 9 % . 
 Deckham is in a safe Labour seat . Mearns ' success in 2010 followed of Sharon Hodgson , who in the 2005 UK General Election polled over 60 % of the votes cast whilst in 2001 , Joyce Quin was returned with a majority of 53 @.@ 3 % . 
 = = Demography = = 
 According to the United Kingdom Census 2001 , Deckham has a population of 9 @,@ 228 – 51 @.@ 5 % of the population are female , slightly above the national average , whilst 48 @.@ 5 % are male . Only 2 % of the population are from a black or other minority ethnic group ( BME ) , as opposed to 9 @.@ 1 % of the national population . Of the BME group , 35 % are from the Asian or Asian – British ethnic group . Deckham has a high proportion of lone parent households at some 15 % of all households . This is the third highest figure in Gateshead and compares with a borough average of 11 @.@ 5 % . Some 31 % of households have dependent children , as opposed to 29 @.@ 5 % nationally and 28 @.@ 4 % in Gateshead . The Index of Multiple Deprivation , which divides England into 32 @,@ 482 areas and measures quality of life to indicate deprivation , splits Deckham into halves and lists the western half , along with Carr Hill and Sheriff Hill , in the top 10 % of all deprived areas in England in 2012 . The eastern half is in the top 5 % of deprived areas . 
 In 2011 however , the ethnic minority population increased rapidly . In 2001 , 96 @.@ 8 % of Deckham 's population were white British , this figure reduced to 92 @.@ 3 % white British in 2011 . Also , the population increased massively too , from 7 @,@ 886 in 2001 to 9 @,@ 938 in 2011 . 88 @.@ 8 % of adults in lone parent households with independent children were women . 
 In 2011 , 7 @.@ 7 % of Deckham 's population were non white British . This is above average for the Metropolitan borough of Gateshead , but below average for the town of Gateshead which Deckham forms a part of . 
 Deckham is situated to the east of Gateshead town centre . It is also split into three sub districts , Central Deckham , Mount Pleasant and Carr Hill .

 Deckham has three buildings listed by English Heritage . They are 33 and 35 Fife Street and the Church of St George . 
 The flats at 33 and 35 Fife Street , in Mount Pleasant , are Grade II Listed buildings . Described by English Heritage as " perhaps the last surviving example of an unspoilt , 2 – flat dwelling of high quality but modest size " , they were built in the latter part of the 19th century from sandstone ashlar and slate . The Church of St George is an Anglican church at the corner of Inskip Terrace and Durham Road built in 1896 by Stephen Piper of Newcastle . This " bold and remarkably simple " church consists of a nave , vestry , bell tower and porch , is built in sandstone and remains in very good condition . Access to the bell tower is by spiral staircase and the staircase and bells are in good order . Of particular note is the church organ ; a Father Willis built organ which has been described as " an utter gem " and " exceptional " . 
 Deckham 's other church is the Emmanuel Pentecostal Church , a plain , stone building located in a prominent position on the corner of Caris Street and Old Durham Road . Little is documented regarding this church , and the date of building is difficult to ascertain , though the Pentecostal movement in Britain dates to 1907 and the church was certified for the <unk> of marriages as recently as 21 October 1959 . The Church is a member of the Assembly of God denomination of Pentecostalism and hold weekly Sunday worship , a prayer service on Mondays and a children 's group on Wednesdays . 
 Two more buildings were locally listed as places of special interest by Gateshead Council . These are Carr Hill Clinic at Carr Hill Road / Ilford Place and St Mark 's Methodist Church at Shipcote Terrace .

 Deckham has several public houses . The Plough Inn on Old Durham Road and is evidenced on the ordnance survey map in 1862 where it is shown as ' Speed the Plough ' . The Shakespeare Inn is on Split Crow Road and Mount Pleasant Working Mans Club is described by one official document as " intrusive " though it hosts several local housing discussion groups . The Deckham Inn at the junction of Split Crow Road and Old Durham Road , was closed in the early 21st century and an application to demolish it to make way for residential flats was approved in 2004 . After objections were raised planning approval was rescinded but it was demolished in 2011 .

 The Deckham Community Association was formed in 1979 as a focal point for resident representation within the community . In 1983 , the association moved into its permanent home , the Deckham Community Centre , on Split Crow Road . The centre was gutted by fire in 2002 in an arson attack and was closed for a year for repairs . An open day was held to mark the reopening in May 2003 . 
 Residents have access to activities such as youth clubs , music tuition and pilates . The association is a registered charity and though fundraising has been a problem the centre is the sole beneficiary of the ' Lee Adamson Memorial Fund ' ; a fundraising trust set up when Adamson , a Deckham resident and volunteer at the centre , died of meningitis in 1998 . By 2011 , the fund had raised around £ 15 @,@ 000 and a plaque was installed in his honour at the centre . It works collaboratively with Route 26 Community Project at the Elgin Centre in Carr Hill , as part of the ' Deckham Cluster ' arrangement . 
 = = = The Elgin Centre = = = 
 The Elgin Centre is on Elgin Road at the south – east boundary between Deckham and Carr Hill . Whilst geographically outside Deckham , the centre provides " the key cluster " of community provisions for its residents . These facilities contribute to the regeneration of the suburb . 
 The facilities are utilized by the Route 26 Community Project ; a registered charity based at the centre which aims to work towards the betterment of lives in Deckham and neighbouring wards . The project works with Gateshead Council and the Gateshead Housing Company to provide a community cafe promoting healthy eating ( the ' T – Junction ' ) , a gymnasium , indoor sports hall , outdoor Five @-@ a @-@ side football pitches and a meeting place for resident groups . The project has education provision for young children as a registered day – care provider and it also offers adult education and training . The project hosts the ' Carnival on the Hill / Deckham Festival ' ; a collaborative enterprise between Route 26 , Gateshead Council and Home Group which offers free activities , such as go @-@ karting and children 's soft play , against the backdrop of a steel band . The second Deckham Festival was held on 3 September 2011 and attracted over one thousand visitors , including Mayor of Gateshead and BBC local weatherman Paul Mooney . 
 = = Transport = = 
 The suburb is crossed by the B1296 Old Durham Road , a commuter road and route of the Great North Road before it was diverted through Low Fell on the route of the A167 . Journey time by car or bus to Gateshead town centre is approximately 5 minutes , and 10 – 12 minutes into the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne . 
 Deckham is in a " metro corridor " so that it is broadly equidistant from Gateshead Metro station and Gateshead Stadium Metro station . 
 Deckham is on a major bus route into Gateshead ; and Old Durham Road is a " bus priority route " . The suburb is served by several bus services , such as the Fab 56 which continues into Sunderland , the <unk> 57 which terminates at Wardley and the CityLink 58 . It is also part of the <unk> Q1 / Q2 network . Services to <unk> MetroCentre and Chester @-@ le @-@ Street also run through and stop in the area . All buses serving Deckham are operated by Go North East under the administration of Nexus . 
 = = Education = = 
 South Street Community Primary School at the northern end of Deckham in Cramer Street and caters for pupils in the 3 – 11 age range . The number of pupils eligible for free school meals is well above the national average . In the most recent OFSTED inspection , the nursery provision was praised for enabling children who enter the school with skills below that expected of similarly – aged children nationwide to achieve well through a stimulating and engaging curriculum and the nursery provision was good overall . The primary provision was praised for providing a safe and engaging learning environment in which children are able to progress to a level broadly comparable with children nationally and where pupils are extremely well behaved . In all inspection categories , the primary provision was judged good . 
 South Street Primary is the only school in Deckham . Some children of primary – school age , particularly those living in the east of Deckham , attend nearby Carr Hill Primary School instead and the majority of children aged 11 – 16 will attend Thomas Hepburn Community Academy in Felling . 
 Deckham compares unfavourably with the wider Gateshead area in respect of adults with educational qualifications . 43 % of adults have no educational qualifications , compared to 38 @.@ 4 % across the whole of Gateshead and the England average of 28 @.@ 9 % . Only 17 % of adults have five or more GCSE 's or equivalent at A * – C ( compared to 36 @.@ 9 % across Gateshead and 47 @.@ 6 % nationally ) whilst 6 % of adults in the suburb have two or more A @-@ Level 's ( or equivalent ) .

 = WarioWare : Smooth Moves = 
 WarioWare : Smooth Moves , known in Japan as <unk> Made in Wario ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , lit . " Dancing Made in Wario " ) , is a party video game developed by Nintendo SPD and Intelligent Systems . The game was published by Nintendo for its Wii video game system in Japan in December 2006 , and in Europe , North America , and Australia in January 2007 . It was re @-@ released in 2011 in Europe as part of the Nintendo Selects program . It is the fifth game in the WarioWare series of games , and the only game in the series to be released for the Wii ( not including WarioWare D.I.Y. Showcase , another WarioWare game for the Wii ) . Like its predecessors , WarioWare : Smooth Moves is built around a collection of microgames that last about five seconds each , and which require that the player hold the Wii Remote in specific positions . The game offers the microgames to the player in rapid succession , by first instructing the player to hold the Wii Remote in a specific manner , and then showing them the microgame . The microgames are divided into several stages , each of which loosely connects the microgames with the help of a story . 
 Smooth Moves was given generally favorable reviews , receiving aggregated scores of 83 % from Metacritic and 81 @.@ 82 % from GameRankings . Praise focused on the game 's entertainment value , especially at parties , while criticism targeted its length . WarioWare : Smooth Moves received a <unk> in the Trend and Lifestyle category from the 2007 Nuremberg International Toy Fair . It was also given the award for Best Action Game at IGN 's Wii Best of E3 2006 Awards ; the website later named it their Game of the Month for January 2007 . WarioWare : Smooth Moves was the United States ' 4th best @-@ selling game in its debut month of January 2007 . In Japan , it sold 63 @,@ 954 copies in its debut week of November 27 – December 3 , 2006 , making it the 4th best @-@ selling launch game for the Wii after Wii Sports , Wii Play , and The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess .

 Similar to previous games in the WarioWare series , WarioWare : Smooth Moves is a puzzle game focusing on microgames , which are short games that last for about five seconds . Each microgame requires that the player position the Wii Remote in a specific way , such as holding it vertically , or placing the bottom end of the device against the nose . The player is required to use the Nunchuk attachment for the Wii Remote in certain microgames . Before each microgame begins , the required position for the Wii Remote is shown to the player , to allow them time to position the device . The game is broken up into stages , each represented by a WarioWare character and loosely connected by a story , with the microgames divided among the stages . After the player completes a stage 's microgames , they advance to the boss stage , which is a microgame that is longer and more complex than the others . After the player completes all of the single @-@ player stages , the game unlocks a multiplayer mode , in which only one Wii Remote is used and shared by up to 12 players . While a player plays a microgame in this mode , other players watch , and after the microgame is completed , the player passes the Wii Remote to the next person . 
 = = Development = = 
 Nintendo first revealed WarioWare : Smooth Moves for the Wii at the 2006 E3 convention . The game was co @-@ developed by Intelligent Systems and the Software Planning Development department of Nintendo . Development on the game began in late 2005 with a team of 20 people , directed by Goro Abe and produced by Yoshio Sakamoto . Abe first came up with the idea for the game when the Wii Remote was revealed to him . Since the developers believed that holding the controller in only one way limited the game 's entertainment value , they decided to introduce new positions and motions to the game for the Remote to be held . The software used to register the Remote 's movements was written from scratch because of the unique movements required for the game . Similar to previous games in the WarioWare series , the game 's subtitle , " Smooth Moves " , was used to represent the basic movement that players perform in the game . The developers wanted players to move as if they were dancing when playing the game , so they decided that Smooth Moves was the best phrase to use to describe the game 's actions . Because of its party genre , the developers made the game 's multiplayer mode its " best point " . 
 There are about 200 minigames included in WarioWare : Smooth Moves , an amount similar to previous WarioWare titles . Abe determined which minigames were included after each team member wrote down an idea on a piece of paper and sent it to him . The minigames were inspired by " very original , everyday life issues " . To offer a different visual style for each minigame , developers were asked to make their own design for the minigame that they were working on . During development , one of the game 's basic concepts was to " make a different taste for every single game " . The only rule that Abe imposed on the minigame designs was for the developers to make it instantly obvious as to what is happening in the minigames . The Wii Remote 's speaker is used in the game to " add a greater sense of feel " . For example , in one microgame , the player must bounce a tennis ball on a racquet . When the ball touches the racquet , the Wii Remote 's speaker emits a bouncing sound and a rumble to " add a very strong reality to the game " . The game mostly forgoes the Wii <unk> attachment and functions strictly with the Wii Remote . Its visual presentation is similar to WarioWare , Inc . : Mega Party Games ! for the Nintendo GameCube , and it does not run in widescreen mode .

 Several reviews praised the game as one of the Wii 's best . The Official Nintendo Magazine said that Wario should " now take his place alongside Mario and Link as a true Nintendo great " . Appreciating the game 's " terrific use of the Wii 's unique control features " , GameSpot remarked that the game also had " amazing " graphics , concluding that it belongs in the game libraries of Wii owners . This sentiment was shared by GameTrailers , which said that WarioWare : Smooth Moves was " without a doubt " the best collection of minigames for the Wii . GameSpy found that the game had " a lot of value " , especially for people who host parties or have groups of friends or family who already enjoy games such as Wii Sports or Rayman Raving Rabbids . Naming WarioWare : Smooth Moves the Game of the Week from January 28 – February 4 , 2007 , The Observer gave particular praise to the game 's graphics , stating , " There are nicely colourful cartoon intros to each level , and the microgames utilise a plethora of visual styles . You 'll notice snippets of favourites from yesteryear , whether it be pulling the Master Sword out of the stone in the Nintendo 64 's The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time or jumping to collect coins as NES @-@ era Mario . " Australia 's The Age found the game " as entertaining to watch as it is to play " , rating it four stars out of five . The Sunday Age newspaper predicted that WarioWare : Smooth Moves , which is " totally unlike anything else out there " , could convert non @-@ gamers into fans of video games . 
 Computer and Video Games predicted that the game " will be the one you come back to when you 've got a full house " , and appreciated its " crazy genius " gameplay . Nintendo World Report was pleased with the game 's variety , but found the small number of unlockable items and lack of high scores disappointing . Although video game review website IGN noted that the game was not the best in the Wario series of video games , they still considered it an " essential piece of the Wii collection " . The website was also entertained by the single @-@ player mode as well as the multiplayer , especially when " <unk> [ ing ] the controller off on unsuspecting <unk> or non @-@ gamers months and years down the road " . They considered the game 's use of the Wii Remote to be " slick and intuitive " , the graphics to be " nearly inexplicable " , and the sound to be " totally off the wall " . GameZone called the game " original and addictive " , but noted that it would not appeal to everyone . The Courier @-@ Mail praised the game 's use of the Wii 's motion @-@ sensitive controllers as one of its best features , which helps push it " over @-@ the @-@ top " as " one of the most inventive games designed for the Wii 's interactive controls " . Canada 's Toronto Sun also appreciated its " novel use " of the Wiimote . 
 A lack of " eye @-@ popping unpredictability [ like ] its predecessors " and difficult controller positions disappointed 1UP.com , but the website still called WarioWare : Smooth Moves a " welcome addition to any Wii library " . Described as a " <unk> insane party game that is a must buy for any Wii owner " , GamePro felt that the game further proves that the Wii is the " must @-@ have " console when playing with friends .

Game Informer felt excited , surprised , and a " little stupid " when waving the Wii remote with the game , concluding that the game will make " friends laugh pretty much non @-@ stop for an hour or two , and that may very well be worth the price of admission " . Despite writing positively about how the game utilizes the Wii remote , Eurogamer was disappointed with its weak long @-@ term appeal because " it never really dares to test players " . 
 = Architecture of Leeds = 
 The architecture of Leeds , a city and metropolitan borough in West Yorkshire , England , encompasses a wide range of architectural styles and notable buildings . As with most northern industrial centres , much of Leeds ' prominent architecture is of the Victorian era . However , the City of Leeds also contains buildings from as early as the Middle Ages such as Kirkstall Abbey , one of Britain 's best preserved ruined Cistercian monasteries , as well as examples of 20th century industrial architecture , particularly in the districts of Hunslet and Holbeck . 
 Most of the current buildings in Leeds are the product of the Industrial Revolution and post war regeneration in the 20th century , as many new buildings were provided in the city 's commuter towns and villages to house the increasing suburban population . Leeds city centre is currently undergoing much redevelopment , with a number of skyscrapers such as Bridgewater Place . Many buildings in Leeds have won awards for their architecture : examples are the renovation projects for the Corn Exchange and the Henry Moore Institute , which have won RIBA awards . 
 = = Pre 1600 = = 
 The earliest evidence of civilisation in the area of Leeds is at Seacroft and dates to 3500 BC . The oldest existent man @-@ made structure in the Leeds metropolitan district is the earthworks of the Iron Age fort at Barwick in Elmet . Leeds is thought to have been the site of the Roman town of <unk> , abandoned when the Romans left Britain in around 400 AD . The first church in Leeds is thought to have been built around 600 AD . 
 Leeds , like many industrial cities , has little remaining medieval architecture . The lack of Medieval architecture in central Leeds may be attributed to the small size of the town during the majority of the period , the population usually being around 1 @,@ 000 . At the time there were several larger settlements in Yorkshire such as Wakefield and York . 
 The Church of St John the Baptist at Adel is one of the earliest remaining buildings in Leeds . It was built between 1150 and 1170 . It has been described as " one of the best and most complete Norman village churches in Yorkshire " . 
 Kirkstall Abbey is the most noteworthy piece of architecture from this period in Leeds . The abbey , which is a Cistercian foundation , was begun on the banks of the River Aire in 1152 . The abbey was disbanded and the buildings ruined during the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII . Although Cistercian abbeys were numerous in England , many were located in remote areas and , unlike several Benedictine and Augustinian abbeys , did not survive the Dissolution by being reused as parish churches . At Kirkstall Abbey , the ruins are particularly well preserved and show an austere form of Norman architecture with some later Gothic additions and embellishments . The remnants of most of the monastic buildings are sufficiently intact to display the domestic arrangement and function of the monastery . The Abbey House Museum keeps records and displays artefacts from the abbey as well as from other eras across Leeds . Paintings of the Abbey have come from artists as renowned as J. M. W. Turner and Thomas Girtin . In 1889 the abbey was purchased by Colonel John North and presented to Leeds City Council . The council restored parts of the abbey and made it safe for public enjoyment before opening it in 1895 . 
 Although central Leeds has few buildings from the Middle Ages , there are examples within the City of Leeds boundaries , including two at Wetherby . Wetherby Bridge dates from the Medieval period , but has been considerably altered , the pointed Gothic arches of different heights being replaced by semi @-@ circular arches . It is said that the Bishop of York granted absolution of sins to local residents in return for building the bridge . 
 The building of a castle was commenced in Wetherby in 1140 , but it was demolished in 1155 , because it was the King had not granted permission for its construction . The remains of its foundations can still be seen , and it is remembered in the street name " Castle Gate " . Harewood Castle is a 14th @-@ century stone hall house and courtyard fortress , in the grounds of Harewood House . It is a Grade I listed and is currently undergoing conservation . 
 = = 1600 to 1800 = = 
 By Tudor times , Leeds had become a market town of about 3 @,@ 000 people , which grew to about 6 @,@ 000 by the mid @-@ 17th century , however successive redevelopments of the city centre in the following centuries have destroyed almost all visible evidence of this period . The earliest building remaining in the city centre is a late 16th- or early 17th @-@ century house in Lambert 's Yard , off <unk> . It is a timber framed building with a gable and three jettied storeys , " possibly the cross @-@ wing of a larger hall house " . It is in a state of disrepair and is not generally accessible to the public . 
 The church of St John the Evangelist , New <unk> , is the oldest church in central Leeds , consecrated in 1634 . It was founded by John Harrison . It is described as " something of an architectural rarity : a virtually intact 17th century church " . In 1865 there were plans to demolish it , but Norman Shaw came to its defence and argued successfully for its restoration . Its interior is unusual in having two naves , and it has a large amount of Jacobean woodwork . It is no longer used for regular services but is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust and is regularly open for visitors and also used for occasional public events . 
 A major example of 18th century architecture lies just outside the city ( although within the City of Leeds boundaries ) in the Grade I listed Harewood House . This was built between 1759 and 1771 and funded from the proceeds of the West Indian Slave Trade . The architect was John Carr of York , with extensions by Robert Adam who also designed the interiors . 
 The opening of a trade hall in Wetherby in 1710 brought about further industrial development , most of this was still on a small scale until the 19th century , but Leeds like Manchester began to show growing industrialisation before many other towns and cities across the industrial belts of Yorkshire and Lancashire did , providing Leeds with a few rare examples of industry from before the period that is generally accepted as the beginning of the industrial revolution ( late 18th century ) had begun . 
 Armley Mills was built in 1788 and is currently the largest woollen mill museum . There are several examples of industrial architecture from the latter part of this era in Holbeck , Hunslet , Armley and areas surrounding Leeds city centre . 
 The main infirmary was originally on Infirmary Street ( near City Square and Quebec Street ) . Designed by John Carr , it was built in 1768 – 1771 and demolished in 1893 to make way for the Yorkshire Penny Bank . 
 Holy Trinity Church on Boar Lane was constructed between 1721 and 1727 , built to a design by William Etty . It is a Grade I listed building . The building has not changed much ( although a new steeple was built in 1839 by R D <unk> ) , but developments such as the Burton Arcade and the Leeds Shopping Plaza have been built so close that it is difficult to see the full exterior of the building as was once possible . 
 In 2007 it was reported in the Yorkshire Evening Post that the remains of a 17th @-@ century cottage in Alwoodley had been demolished after controversial approval from Leeds City Council . 
 = = Nineteenth century = = 
 It was in the 19th century that Leeds began to grow into one of Britain 's largest cities . This led to widespread building across the city . Leeds ' wool and cloth trades resulted in the building of many industrial buildings during this era . The resulting workforce which migrated to the city from rural areas brought about the building of many houses . Leeds has perhaps the most surviving examples of back @-@ to @-@ back terrace housing in the UK , particularly in Holbeck and Harehills . 
 Headingley Castle , also known for a good deal of the 19th century as The Elms , was designed in about 1841 on land that had been owned by Barbara Marshall . It was built between 1843 and 1846 by the local architect John Child for the corn merchant Thomas England . The estate was originally 22 acres . While the exterior of Headingley Castle is Victorian Gothic in style , the architect employed modern building techniques and materials including cast iron in its construction . 
 Leeds city centre has many examples from this era , such as Leeds Town Hall , the Leeds <unk> Market , the Hotel Metropole , the Leeds City Varieties , the Central Post Office , Calls Landings and the Corn Exchange to name a few . 
 Leeds Town Hall ( pictured top ) was designed by Cuthbert Brodrick and was opened by Queen Victoria in 1858 . The Hotel Metropole was built in the 1890s and was inspired by French architecture of the time . The Leeds Corn Exchange was also designed by Cuthbert Brodrick and was built between 1861 and 1864 . The building lay derelict for many years until 1985 when it was converted into a shopping centre . Harehills , Burley , Holbeck , Chapeltown , Woodhouse and East End Park contain many houses from this era , while Cross Gates has a 120 @-@ foot ( 37 m ) column guided gasholder from this era . 
 The 19th century saw the construction of most of Leeds ' railway infrastructure , including architecturally notable viaducts in Holbeck and Leeds city centre . None of the major railway stations from this era have survived , in fact most of Leeds railway station was rebuilt as recently as 2002 . 
 As well as industrial architecture Hunslet has a history for some notable churches . The main steeple on Church Lane was once part of a large church . All but the steeple were demolished in the 1970s and a smaller church building attached . Meadow Lane in Hunslet was also home to Christ Church , an architecturally notable Gothic church , which has since been demolished . 
 Leeds Parish Church was constructed in 1841 and at 115 feet ( 35 m ) tall it held the record as Leeds ' tallest building until the building of the town hall in 1858 . 
 = = = Housing = = = 
 Leeds ' growth in the 19th century led to mass migration to the city ; this resulted in many areas of the city becoming overcrowded and many new houses being built . The industrial revolution led to the increase in both working and middle classes , leading to the building of many new houses , aimed at both classes . The most common form of housing to be built for the working classes was the ' back to back ' . Back to back terrace houses were built in the largely working class districts of Harehills , Holbeck , Hunslet , Beeston and Armley , whilst larger through terrace houses were built for the middle classes in Headingley and Kirkstall . Chapeltown developed as an affluent district of Leeds , and boasts many large Victorian villas , however the popularity of outer suburbs such as Roundhay towards the late 20th century brought land values down in Chapeltown and the area fell into decline . 
 In 1830 the cost of building a small back to back house in Leeds was between seventy and eighty pounds . The average weekly rent was between two and four shillings ( around a fifth of the average wages at the time ) . 
 = = Twentieth century = = 
 Leeds has a wide variety of buildings from this era . Chapel Allerton has many art deco semi detached houses from the 1930s while large parts of the city centre contain many commercial buildings from this era . Seacroft has many examples of 20th century residential architecture . 
 = = = Early era = = = 
 For the first decade of the 20th century many areas of Leeds saw a continuation of Victorian style architecture , particularly in areas like Beeston . 
 The Hyde Park Picture House , Hyde Park was originally built in 1908 as a hotel and in 1914 it was converted into a picture house . The cinema has gas lighting , the original organ and piano . It is a grade II listed building and one of the few surviving picture palaces in the UK . The picture house is regarded by many to be one of the finest examples of Edwardian architecture in Leeds . 
 = = = Art deco = = = 
 Chapel Allerton and to a lesser extent Headingley boast many art deco houses . Parts of the Leeds General Infirmary were built in art deco styles . Chapel Allerton also boasted the former Dominion Cinema , which was built in art deco style , however this closed in the late 1960s and became a bingo hall ; which was later demolished in the 1990s . 
 = = = 1920s and 1930s = = = 
 Leeds Civic Hall was designed by E. Vincent Harris in 1926 and built between 1931 and 1933 to provide the unemployed with work during the Great Depression . The Quarry Hill Estate was designed in 1933 but not completed until 1941 They were designed by Leeds ' Director of Housing RAH <unk> ( 1898 – 1959 ) and utilised a monolithic modernist design based on European examples , in particular the Karl Marx @-@ Hof in Vienna . This was revolutionary at a time when most mass Council housing was based on a weak Neo @-@ Georgian design . They were demolished throughout the 1970s and 80s after poor maintenance . 
 It provided the backdrop for Yorkshire Television sitcom , Queenie 's Castle . 
 The Queens Hotel on City Square was constructed in 1937 . 
 The following year , Shaftesbury House , a large five @-@ storey brick hostel for working men and woman opened . It was designed in 1936 by George Clark Robb , senior architectural assistant to <unk> , and after its closure , was converted in 2006 @-@ 7 to the sustainable Green House . 
 = = = Brutalism = = = 
 Leeds has limited examples of Brutalism , one such being the Leeds International Swimming Pool ( designed by disgraced architect John Poulson ) . until the commencement of its demolition in Autumn 2009 , following its closure in October 2007 . The Leeds International Pool was not without its design flaws , the pool size was miscalculated and was less than an inch too narrow to qualify for Olympic Standard meaning that it never held the competitions the council had hoped for and it spent much of the 1960s closed while problems with its construction were rectified . 
 Parts of the Merrion Centre have brutalist undertones , particularly around the office blocks constructed as part of it and the former outdoor escalators to the rear . 
 Hunslet Grange Flats ( more commonly known as the Leek Street Flats ) displayed brutalism . They replaced run down back to back houses . It is unusual that Leek Street was chosen as their informal name as they replaced many other streets , including longer streets such as Alton Street . The flats were popular at first ; however , they were so poorly designed and constructed that in 1983 they were demolished only thirteen years after being constructed . Smaller shops on the site had been demolished even earlier . 
 For a picture of the flats see the <unk> Database : ( picture in 1975 ) and a ( picture in 1973 ) . 
 Often unseen parts of the University of Leeds display elements of brutalism , with large areas of exposed concrete . From the A660 however , only older parts of the university are visible . To view these parts of the university it is necessary to walk through the main campus . 
 = = = 1960s to 1980s = = = 
 Many areas of Leeds such as Seacroft were almost entirely built in this era . There are many high @-@ rise council flats in Leeds as well as office buildings such as West Riding House . Many Victorian slums were demolished during this era and replaced with council housing . There was also widespread private residential developments . Holt Park was a joint effort between the Leeds City Council and Norman Ashton . There were many <unk> homes built during this time , particularly in Holt Park and Wetherby . 
 West Riding House was completed in 1973 and was the tallest building in Leeds until the completion of Bridgewater Place in 2007 . In 2008 it was knocked into third position with the opening of Opal Tower . 
 The Inner Ring Road was constructed over the course of the 1960s . This was the most ambitious scheme of its kind in the UK with Leeds City Council subsequently promoting the city with the slogan Motorway City of the Seventies . The works involved the construction of many flyovers and tunnels and the Motorway construction is notable in itself . 
 Another council plan during the 1960s was to separate pedestrians and traffic , and it was proposed that any new buildings in City Square would be built with an overhead walkway – this never came to fruition , with only a short section ever being built . 
 The growth of the financial and business services sector from the mid @-@ 1980s onwards resulted in a boom in office developments in the city centre . Many of the buildings constructed at this time are in the style known as the " Leeds Look " , which is typified by the use of dark red brickwork and steeply pitched grey slate roofs . 
 = = = 1990s = = = 
 The 1990s saw further residential development , such as that around Colton . Schofields Department Store was demolished and replaced by the Schofield Centre ( later the <unk> Centre and now The Core ) and the White Rose Centre was constructed . The 1990s also saw Tesco redevelop Seacroft town centre , which had previously been architecturally notable for 1960s architecture . 
 Quarry House was constructed on the site of the former Quarry Hill Flats ( see 1920s and 1930s ) at Quarry Hill . The building houses the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions and is their main regional offices . The building is controversial . Its imposing design has often been regarded as being domineering and self @-@ important and has led the building to be nicknamed The Kremlin and The Ministry of Truth . 
 = = = Housing = = = 
 As in much of the UK , Leeds ' housing stock had fallen into disrepair by the middle of the 20th century . The city was overcrowded , and the Victorian terraces were unsuitable for modern inhabitation . Leeds had one of the most Labour orientated councils and in the 1930s pledged to replace 30 @,@ 000 slums . The older houses relied mainly on heating from open coal fires , which led to problems with smog ( in 1962 , 24 deaths in Leeds were attributed to this ) , although this problem was partially relieved in the 1950s with the introduction of the Clean Air Act 1956 . Although a slum clearance scheme was under way in the 1930s , it took until after the Second World War , for the scheme to get well under way . In the 1950s , the largest social housing project began with the building of the Seacroft Estate . Seacroft was planned at the time to be a ' Satellite town within the city limits ' . The building of new council estates was most prevalent in the city 's east end and because of this the city expanded much further East in the latter part of the 20th century then it did any other direction . The Langbar Gardens Estate ( completed 1966 ) in <unk> lay right on the eastern fringes of the city sprawl until it was demolished in the early 21st century , including the high profile implosions of Langbar Towers , Langbar Grange and Ash Tree Grange . By the 1960s and 1970s land for social housing was becoming scarcer and the council started looking towards building ' high rise ' , with such estates as Cottingley sporting prominent tower blocks . By the 1970s less land was available for such developments and the particularly large estates were becoming unpopular , however faced with a need for a larger social housing stock , Leeds City Council built smaller estates such as Holt Park ( in partnership with Norman Ashton ) , replaced the prefabricated ' war houses ' in Cottingley with newer <unk> and redeveloped areas such as <unk> in <unk> . 
 Perhaps the most obvious housing incarnation of this era has been the council house . These have been a subject of some controversy since they were built . On the one hand some people argue they vastly improved Britain 's housing stock , and provided their occupants with modern luxuries such as central heating , an inside lavatory and a modern kitchen , while others criticise the way they were built , the disruption to communities , the build quality of certain batches of houses and the policy of housing problem tenants in them . Certain estates in Leeds have suffered from high crime and poverty and thus had low house prices ( such as Seacroft , <unk> , Belle Isle and Halton Moor ) , while others have maintained a lower crime rate and enjoy buoyant house prices ( such as Moor Grange , the <unk> estate in <unk> , Ireland Wood , Holt Park and <unk> ) . 
 = = Post Millennium = = 
 So far during this period , Leeds has seen much development , particularly in the city centre , most notably the highrise developments such as Bridgewater Place , the developments around Clarence Dock , K2 ( albeit a conversion from an older building ) as well as many developments incorporating student accommodation . The 2002 redevelopment of Leeds railway station incorporated a notable steel and glass roof covering the main platform hall and providing panoramic views to the south west from the mezzanine level . 
 = = = Bridgewater Place = = = 
 Bridgewater Place is currently the tallest building in Leeds and the second tallest structure in Yorkshire after the Emley Moor Television Transmitter ( near Huddersfield ) . The building comprises offices , flats , shops and restaurants . Bridgewater Place is 361 feet ( 110 m ) tall and has 32 storeys . The original design included a spire , but this was never added . In 2008 , Building Design , the architectural journal , shortlisted Bridgewater Place for the Carbuncle Cup , which is awarded to ' buildings so ugly they freeze the heart ' .

 Opal 3 is a skyscraper in Leeds situated to the north of the city centre on Wade Lane , adjacent to the Merrion Centre and Tower House . The building was officially completed in September 2008 and at 269 feet ( 82 m ) with 27 storeys Opal 3 is Leeds ' third tallest building after Bridgewater Place and Sky Plaza . The building consists solely of student accommodation for the University of Leeds and Leeds Metropolitan University as well as Leeds ' other further education institutions . The building was built on the former site of the Little Londoner ( later The Londoner ) public house , as well as some former car parking in the Lovell Park area of the city . Opal 3 was fully booked for the 2008 academic year . It contains 542 students flats ( all which are en @-@ suite ) as well as a gym for student use .

It has 37 storeys ( making it the building with the most storeys in Leeds , as the Bridgewater Place has commercial height ceilings . These are particularly high for the first eight storeys ) . 
 = = = Leeds Dock = = = 
 Leeds Dock was originally a large timber dock , situated between the city centre and Hunslet . Decades of industrial decline left the dock obsolete . The opening of the Royal Armouries Museum in 1996 began the regeneration of the area , however little else was undertaken , until the wider redevelopment began in 2001 . This was completed in 2007 ( at a cost of £ 260 million ) and includes flats , offices , bars , restaurants , a hotel and a casino . The development centres on the dock itself as well as around ' Armouries Boulevard ' and ' Armouries Square ' , two pedestrianised thoroughfares . The main office block on the development is Livingston House which has not yet attracted a tenant . The smaller dock incorporates six residential berths for house boats , while a passenger boat service to Granary Wharf runs from here . 
 The development has not been without criticism , with many people in the city commenting on the lack of people in the area , while architect Maxwell Hutchinson described them as the " slums of the future " . and described the development as a " mundane collection " of buildings and an " incredibly soulless place " and claimed that " in two or three decades these shiny new buildings will be following Quarry Hill down the spiral of decay " . These claims were explored on the BBC television programme Inside Out . While at a fashion show at Leeds Dock , Gok Wan claimed he thought the development would be a huge success .

 Leeds Arena is a 13 @,@ 500 seat ' super @-@ theatre ' style venue , the first in the UK to be built in a ' fan ' orientation . Construction began in 2011 after decades of calls for a venue to replace the Queens Hall , which was demolished in 1989 and represented the city 's only large concert hall . In the intervening period Leeds was the only major city in the UK without such a venue . 
 The building itself is based around a striking honeycomb frontage , modelled on close @-@ up images of an insect 's eye , and is illuminated at night in a variety of colours that reflect the mood of whichever show is playing at the time . 
 = = Future = = 
 Two major developments in Leeds city centre were planned for completion around the beginning of the new decade , but were put on hold due to the prevailing economic conditions and subsequently cancelled . These buildings were Criterion Place and Lumiere , both of which would have been the tallest residential buildings in the UK at the time of their completion . 
 Planning permission has been approved for a 200 @-@ room five star Hilton hotel opposite the new Leeds Arena site which was due to be completed around 2015 , although the project is currently on hiatus following the collapse of the main contractor involved . The development was relocated from Clarence Dock following the refusal of its planning permission for that site . 
 = = Critical reception on Leeds ' architecture = = 
 In 1968 John Betjeman made a television film called A Poet Goes North in which he gave his opinion on the changing architecture of Leeds . Betjeman described the constant sound of falling Victorian architecture . Betjeman also lambasted British Railways House ( now City House ) saying it blocked all the light out to City Square and was only a testament to money and had no architectural merit of its own . Betjeman also praised Leeds Town Hall in the film . The film , which was never broadcast at the time , was preserved by Leeds Civic Trust and has been restored by the Yorkshire Film Archive . It was screened as part of the Leeds International Film Festival in 2008 . 
 Architect and critic Maxwell Hutchinson has attracted controversy in his criticism of recent architectural developments in Leeds , most notably Clarence Dock . In referring to Leeds ' plans for the future , Hutchinson said " there are worrying signs that Yorkshire is about to make the same mistakes that we have made in London over 20 years ago " . Hutchinson also criticised the dearth of services in the city centre , referring to its lack of schools and health @-@ care facilities . Hutchinson also described the Clarence Dock development as " the slums of the future " . These claims were explored on the BBC television programme , Inside Out . Hutchinson claimed that Leeds needed an iconic building like Manchester 's The Lowry or Gateshead 's The Sage . However he claimed that the redevelopment of older buildings around The Calls " could compete with anywhere in Europe for the quality and sensitivity of its design . " 
 The Guardian architecture critic Owen Hatherley lamented post @-@ millennium architecture in Leeds and bemoaned the weak planning system for allowing a wave of " astoundingly cheap @-@ looking architecture " in the city . Hatherley points to Sky Plaza as a prime example . 
 = = Public space = = 
 Leeds city centre has four main public squares being Park Square , City Square , Armouries Square and Millennium Square . 
 Smaller squares do exist , including Dortmund Square , St Peters Square , Queen Square , Woodhouse Square and Hanover Square . While the rest of Leeds has large open parks , this is something the city centre lacks and most free recreational space is contained within these squares . Since 2000 , both City Square and Millennium Square have been redeveloped with hard landscaping . In an interview with Martin Wainwright , the northern editor of The Guardian , architect Irena Bauman , praised City Square for being a well designed and well used public space , however she criticised The Plaza Tower development for its lack of public space , stating that the only space made available was for service vehicles .

 The 2015 Tour de Yorkshire was a cycling stage race that took place in Yorkshire in May 2015 . It was the first edition of the Tour de Yorkshire and was organised by Welcome to Yorkshire and the Amaury Sport Organisation , who also organised the Yorkshire stages of the 2014 Tour de France . The race started in Bridlington on 1 May and ended in Leeds on 3 May . It included three stages and was rated as a 2 @.@ 1 event as part of the 2015 UCI Europe Tour . 
 The first stage of the race was won by Lars Petter Nordhaug ( Team Sky ) in a sprint from a small group . He kept his lead through the second stage , which ended in a bunch sprint , and was able to extend it slightly in the third and final stage of the race . He won the general classification in the race by eleven seconds . Samuel Sánchez ( BMC Racing Team ) was second and Thomas Voeckler ( Team Europcar ) was third . Nordhaug also won the points classification and Team Sky won the teams classification . The mountains classification was won by Nicolas Edet ( Cofidis )

 The race was first discussed publicly in July 2014 , after the first stages of the 2014 Tour de France that took place in Yorkshire . It was organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation , the organisers of the Tour de France , and Welcome to Yorkshire , who had been the organisers of the Yorkshire stages of the 2014 Tour de France . On 22 December 2014 , the start and finish locations for the event were released , these were Bridlington , Leeds , Scarborough , Selby , Wakefield and York . On 21 January 2015 , details of the three stages of the route were unveiled at the Bridlington Spa . The first two stages ( especially the second ) were expected to suit the sprinters , while the third stage was described as the " queen stage " . It included several roads and climbs that had been part of the second stage of the 2014 Tour de France between York and Sheffield . The stage was rated as a 2 @.@ 1 event . 
 There was also a women 's race that took place as part of the Tour de Yorkshire event . This took place on the second day of the men 's race over four laps of the 20 @-@ kilometre ( 12 mi ) route around York that was also the final part of the men 's racing that day . Lizzie Armitstead , who did not compete in the event due to a conflicting event in Europe , expressed a hope that the women 's race in future would be a three @-@ day event like the men 's race . The women 's race was won by Louse Mahé ( Ikon @-@ <unk> ) in a sprint finish .

Teams could enter between five and eight riders . Fourteen teams selected eight riders and four teams selected seven ; 140 riders were therefore entered into the race . One rider ( Caleb Fairly of Giant – Alpecin ) pulled out before the start , so the race began with a peloton of 139 riders .

 Much of the pre @-@ race media focused on the presence of Bradley Wiggins , Britain 's first ever winner of the Tour de France , who was riding his first race for his new team , WIGGINS . Wiggins was controversially not selected for Team Sky in the previous year 's Tour de France ; the race organisers expected his presence in the Tour de Yorkshire to be one of the principal attractions for British cycling fans . Wiggins was not , however , expected to attempt to win the overall classification in the race ; his main objective was preparing for his hour record attempt in June . 
 Cycling Weekly expected that the race would be dominated by " punchy all @-@ rounders " . The riders expected to perform strongly over the three days included Ben Swift ( Team Sky ) , Moreno Hofland and Steven Kruijswijk ( both LottoNL – Jumbo ) , Greg Van Avermaet ( BMC Racing Team ) , Thomas Voeckler ( Team Europcar ) and Erick <unk> ( Madison Genesis ) . The second stage appeared most likely to end in a sprint , with Marcel Kittel ( Giant – Alpecin ) the favourite to take victory , although he had suffered an illness and had not raced since the Tour of Qatar in February . Other prominent sprinters included Swift and Hofland , as well as Matteo Pelucchi ( IAM Cycling ) , Rick Zabel ( BMC Racing Team ) , Gerald Ciolek ( MTN – Qhubeka ) and Steele Von Hoff ( NFTO ) .

 1 May — Bridlington to Scarborough , 174 km ( 108 mi ) 
 The first stage of the race began in Bridlington on the North Sea coast . The riders first travelled north @-@ east to Flamborough , where they turned to the north @-@ west . Initially this kept them along the coast , but soon took them into the North York Moors , where the first climb was the Côte de Dalby Forest . This came after 51 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 32 @.@ 0 mi ) ; the categorised portion of the climb was 0 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 37 mi ) at 8 @.@ 9 % . The riders then turned to the south @-@ west and descended to Pickering , where the first intermediate sprint was positioned . The route turned north , back onto the Moors , where they reached the Côte de Rosedale Abbey after 92 kilometres ( 57 mi ) . This was the longest climb of the day : 2 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 7 mi ) at 7 % . The riders continued north as far as Castleton , where they turned east . After 123 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 76 @.@ 7 mi ) , the riders climbed the Côte de Grosmont ( 0 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 25 mi ) at 16 @.@ 9 % ) , then the Côte de <unk> ( 1 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 81 mi ) at 6 @.@ 2 % ) . From here , they returned to the coast at Whitby , where there was another intermediate sprint ; the riders then turned south . The final climb of the day came after 146 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 91 @.@ 0 mi ) ; it was the Côte de Robin Hood 's Bay ( 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) at 10 @.@ 3 % ) . The riders then continued south to the finish line in Scarborough , doing a loop around the town before finishing on the sea front . In total the day included 2 @,@ 000 metres ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) of climbing , although the highest point was just 350 metres ( 1 @,@ 150 ft ) above sea level . Thomas Voeckler ( Team Europcar ) described the stage as " much tougher than we thought " due to the small roads . 
 An initial breakaway was formed by Mark Christian ( WIGGINS ) , Loïc <unk> ( Cofidis ) , Eddie Dunbar ( NFTO ) , Mark Stewart ( Madison Genesis ) and Rasmus Quaade ( Cult Energy Pro Cycling ) . They built up a five @-@ minute lead but Team Sky chased hard ; the break 's lead was reduced to a few seconds by the Côte de Rosedale Abbey . A new breakaway was formed here by Perrig Quéméneur ( Team Europcar ) and Tim Declercq ( Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) , while Marcel Kittel ( Giant – Alpecin ) was dropped and abandoned the race shortly afterwards . With 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) remaining , the peloton descended into <unk> in wet conditions . Team Sky were riding at the front of the peloton . Sky 's Ben Swift and Ian Boswell and NFTO 's Eddie Dunbar crashed . Dunbar suffered a broken clavicle and Swift a shoulder injury : both were forced to abandon the race . 
 The crucial move of the race came with 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) remaining as the race went through Whitby . A 15 @-@ man group formed here . This was reduced to five riders on the Côte de Robin Hood ’ s Bay . Philip Deignan ( Team Sky ) rode hard on the climb , with only Stéphane Rossetto ( Cofidis ) , Samuel Sánchez ( BMC Racing Team ) , Voeckler , and Deignan 's teammate Lars Petter Nordhaug able to follow him . Despite attacks on the way into Scarborough , these five riders came to the finish line together . Nordhaug won the sprint ahead of Voeckler and Rossetto . The peloton was more than a minute behind ; the sprint was won by Greg Van Avermaet ( BMC Racing Team ) . 
 Thanks to bonus seconds , Nordhaug led the race by four seconds ahead of Voeckler . He also led the points classification . The mountains classification was led by Quéméneur . Quéméneur was also awarded the combativity prize after the online vote : Dunbar won the vote , but was unable to receive the prize because he had been hospitalised due to his crash .

 2 May — Selby to York , 174 km ( 108 mi ) 
 The second stage of the race , which was much flatter than the first and third stages , began in Selby , North Yorkshire . The stage began with an 8 @.@ 2 @-@ kilometre ( 5 @.@ 1 mi ) neutralised section , which included a loop around the town centre ; the racing started as the riders headed east for 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) towards Market Weighton . Here they turned south and climbed the first of the day 's two categorised climbs ; this was the Côte de North Newbald ( 1 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) at 5 @.@ 3 % ) . The route again turned east and the riders reached Beverley after 45 kilometres ( 28 mi ) . From here the route turned north and entered the Yorkshire Wolds ; there was an intermediate sprint as the route passed through <unk> . Immediately after the intermediate sprint came the second climb of the day , the Côte de <unk> ( 1 @.@ 1 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 68 mi ) at 6 @.@ 2 % ) . At the summit of the climb , there were 78 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 48 @.@ 8 mi ) to the finish line . The riders continued north as far as Malton , then turned south @-@ west towards York . The race concluded in York with a 20 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 12 @.@ 7 mi ) finishing circuit . The riders entered the circuit with 52 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 32 @.@ 6 mi ) to the end of the stage and rode the 11 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 1 mi ) to the finishing line , where the second intermediate sprint of the day took place . They then rode two complete laps of the circuit ; the race finished with the third crossing of the finish line , after 174 kilometres ( 108 mi ) . 
 An early breakaway of 18 riders formed . This included Philip Deignan ( Team Sky ) , who had been in the winning break in the first stage and was 10 seconds off the race lead . The other teams in the peloton were not willing to let a breakaway that included Deignan go ; eventually he and nine others dropped back to the main peloton . Eight riders were therefore left in the lead group : Andy Tennant ( WIGGINS ) , Bert De Backer ( Giant – Alpecin ) , Stijn Steels ( Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) , Giovanni Bernaudeau ( Team Europcar ) , Matt Brammeier ( MTN – Qhubeka ) , Nicolas Edet ( Cofidis ) , Ivar Slik ( Team Roompot ) and Mark McNally ( Madison Genesis ) . McNally won both categorised climbs . The break 's lead was nearly seven minutes with 78 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 48 @.@ 8 mi ) remaining ; Sky and IAM Cycling began chasing hard and reduced the gap sharply ; the breakaway had less than two minutes ' lead as they entered the laps around York . 
 The breakaway split up ; McNally and De Backer remained alone in the lead with 11 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) left . McNally was voted as the day 's most combative rider through a Twitter vote , but he was unable to stay with De Backer in the final 5 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 4 mi ) . De Backer continued alone ; he was briefly joined by <unk> <unk> ( Cofidis ) but the pair were unable to stay away from the chasing pack . As they were caught , with 700 metres ( 2 @,@ 300 ft ) remaining , Greg Van Avermaet attacked . Although he appeared to have a lead large enough to secure the stage victory , he ran out of energy shortly before the line and was caught by the sprinters . The first of these was Moreno Hofland ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) , who won his team 's first victory of the year , with Matteo Pelucchi ( IAM Cycling second and Ramon <unk> ( Giant – Alpecin ) third . 
 Because of a split in the peloton , Voeckler and Rossetto both lost six seconds . Samuel Sánchez therefore moved up into second place overall , while Nordhaug 's lead increased to ten seconds .

 3 May — Wakefield to Leeds , 167 km ( 104 mi ) 
 The third stage was the queen stage of the race and included several of the roads used in stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France . The stage began in Wakefield , West Yorkshire , outside the city 's cathedral ; there was a neutralised lap of the city centre before the riders left the city to the south . The route passed through Sandal and reached Barnsley after 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) . Here the roads turned west and entered the Pennines . The first climb of the day came after 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) : this was the Côte de Holmfirth ( 2 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 8 mi ) at 5 @.@ 5 % ) . From here the route was twisting , though it generally travelled north as it passed to the west of Huddersfield and Halifax . The next climb , the Côte de Scapegoat Hill ( 2 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 4 mi ) at 8 @.@ 3 % ) , came after 55 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 34 @.@ 5 mi ) of racing . The riders briefly left Yorkshire for the only time in the race ( the route entered Greater Manchester but immediately returned to West Yorkshire ) . The roads were hilly throughout , with barely any flat road . The next categorised climb was the Côte de Hebden Bridge ( 4 @.@ 1 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) at 5 @.@ 5 % ) after 95 kilometres ( 59 mi ) with the Côte de Goose Eye ( 1 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 81 mi ) at 10 % ) shortly afterwards . After 129 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 80 @.@ 5 mi ) , there was an intermediate sprint in Ilkley , then the Côte de Cow and Calf ( 1 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 1 mi ) at 8 % ) . At the top of the climb , there were 35 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 22 @.@ 1 mi ) to the finish line . The final categorised climb of the race , the Côte de The <unk> ( 1 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 87 mi ) at 10 @.@ 3 % ) , was 24 kilometres ( 15 mi ) from the finish ; there was also a slight climb to the second intermediate sprint in Arthington . There was then a fairly flat 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) section to the finish line in Leeds , with the finish line in Roundhay Park . 
 The day 's main breakaway was formed by Lawson Craddock ( Giant – Alpecin ) , Sondre Holst Enger ( IAM Cycling ) , <unk> Janse van Rensburg ( MTN – Qhubeka ) , Nicolas Edet ( Cofidis ) , James McLoughlin ( Madison Genesis ) , Ian Bibby ( NFTO and Rasmus Quaade ( Cult Energy Pro Cycling ) . They built a lead of around five minutes ahead of the peloton , which was led by Sky . Bibby won the first three climbs of the day ; the group then split apart on the Côte de Goose Eye . Craddock was the first to cross the summit with only Edet able to follow him . With less than 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) to the finish line , the two riders had a lead of nearly five minutes . Edet won the next two climbs and secured victory in the mountains classification . 
 With 35 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 22 @.@ 1 mi ) remaining , the gap was about 90 seconds as Sky 's David López , Ian Boswell and Philip Deignan led the remaining part of the peloton . Josh Edmondson ( Great Britain ) made an unsuccessful attack from this group . On the uncategorised climb leading up to the final sprint of the day , Craddock dropped Edet and continued alone . In the peloton , Samuel Sánchez also attacked on the climb . Nordhaug followed him and won the final bonus second , putting him more than ten seconds ahead of Sánchez . Steve Cummings ( MTN – Qhubeka ) and Steven Kruijswijk ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) attacked together after the climb ; they too were unsuccessful . The final attack of the day came from Ben Hermans ( BMC Racing Team ) with approximately 11 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) to the finish line . He caught and passed Craddock 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) later ; meanwhile Sky led the group without making any particular effort to chase Hermans down . 
 Hermans won a solo victory ; the 17 @-@ man group was nine seconds behind . Greg Van Avermaet won the sprint for second , with Julien Simon third . Nordhaug finished in fifth to secure victory overall and in the points classification . Sky also won the teams classification . Edet won the mountains classification . The final combativity prize was won by Bibby . 
 = = Classifications = = 
 The race included three individual classifications and a team classification . The most important of these was the general classification . This was calculated by adding up each cyclist 's finishing times on each stage . Bonus seconds were awarded for top @-@ three placings in each stage ( 10 seconds for the first rider , 6 seconds for the second , 4 seconds for the third ) and for placings in intermediate sprints ( 3 seconds for the first rider , 2 seconds for the second , 1 second for the third ) . The rider with the lowest cumulative time after taking bonus seconds into account was the leader of the classification and was awarded a blue and yellow jersey . ( Blue and yellow are colours traditionally associated with Yorkshire . ) The winner of the general classification was considered the winner of the race . 
 The second classification was points classification . On each stage of the race , points were awarded to the top 10 riders . The winner won 15 points , with 12 for the second @-@ placed rider , 9 for the third @-@ placed rider , 7 for the sixth @-@ placed rider and then one point fewer for each place down to tenth place . Points were also awarded to the top three riders at intermediate sprints , with five points for the winner of the sprint and three , and one points for the riders in second and third places respectively . The rider with the most points was the leader of the classification and was awarded a green jersey . There was also a mountains classification . Over the three stages , there were 13 categorised climbs . On each of these climbs , the first four riders to the summit were awarded points , with 5 for the first rider , 3 for the second , 2 for the third and 1 for the fourth . The rider with the most accumulated points was the leader of the classification and was awarded a dark pink jersey . 
 The final classification was a team classification . The team 's time on each was calculated by taking the best three riders from that team and adding their times together ; the team with the lowest cumulative time was the leader of the classification . 
 Another jersey was awarded at the end of each stage . This was a combativity prize and was to be awarded to the rider who " made the greatest effort and [ ... ] demonstrated the best qualities in terms of sportsmanship " . A jury selected a list of riders to be eligible for the prize ; the winner of the prize was then decided by a vote on Twitter . The rider was awarded a grey jersey .

 = Hurricane Alberto ( 2000 ) = 
 Hurricane Alberto was among the longest @-@ lived tropical cyclones on record in the Atlantic Ocean . The third tropical cyclone , first named storm , and first hurricane of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season , Alberto developed near the western coast of Africa from a tropical wave on August 3 . Initially a tropical depression , it strengthened into Tropical Storm Alberto early on August 4 . While briefly turning westward on August 6 , Alberto attained hurricane status . The cyclone continued to track west @-@ northwestward , and by early the following day , reached an initial peak with winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) . Shortly thereafter , Alberto re @-@ curved northwestward and began encountering increased wind shear . As a result , Alberto weakened back to a tropical storm on August 9 . However , the system quickly re @-@ strengthened as winds became more favorable , and early on August 10 , Alberto became a hurricane again . The storm gradually curved northward and north @-@ northeastward between August 11 and August 12 ; Alberto attained its peak intensity with winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) during that time . 
 Increasing upper @-@ level westerlies caused Alberto to weaken as it moved east @-@ northeastward , with the cyclone losing most of its convection . Early on August 14 , Alberto was downgraded to a tropical storm . A westerly trough that had been guiding Alberto outran the storm , and strong ridging developed to the north and west . As a result , Alberto turned southward on August 15 , southwestward on August 16 , and then to the west on August 17 . While curving northwestward and then northward , Alberto began to re @-@ strengthen , and was upgraded to a hurricane for a third time on August 18 . Alberto reached a third peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 105 mph ( 205 km / h ) on August 20 . After weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane , Alberto conducted an unusually large cyclonic loop , spanning approximately 5 degrees latitude and 8 degrees longitude . The cyclone was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 23 , shortly before completing its extratropical transition . Although it did not effect land while tropical , the precursor tropical wave caused light rainfall in Senegal . The remnant extratropical cyclone also likely produced tropical storm force winds in Iceland and Jan Mayen . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A mesoscale convective complex , or large circular area of thunderstorms , developed in the Ethiopian Highlands of Africa on July 28 . The complex moved west @-@ southwestward through the continent , waxing and waning until persisting along a tropical wave on August 2 . The next day , the wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from Guinea . Once over the open Atlantic Ocean , the wave quickly developed and became Tropical Depression Three later that day . The depression moved to the west @-@ northwest and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alberto early on August 4 . Alberto continued to strengthen , but moved to cooler waters late on August 5 and weakened briefly . However , the storm strengthened again early on August 6 , and it was upgraded to hurricane status as an eye became visible . The upgrade was accompanied with a brief westward turn . However , Alberto continued to move to the west @-@ northwest later that day , reaching its first peak intensity of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) on August 7 . 
 A vigorous upper @-@ level low developed west of Alberto on August 7 and August 8 . This caused an increase in vertical shear , weakening the hurricane down to a tropical storm on August 9 . The low also caused the storm to turn to the northwest . However , on August 10 , Alberto became better organised and was upgraded to hurricane status again . It then moved in a gradual curve towards the north and northeast through a break in a subtropical ridge between August 11 and August 12 . Alberto made its closest approach to Bermuda on August 11 , passing about 345 mi ( 555 km ) east of the island . The strong storm became a Category 3 major hurricane on August 12 and reached its second and highest peak intensity of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) , and a 60 mi ( 95 km ) wide eye was observed . Alberto was an unusual storm in that it reached its peak intensity at a high latitude , north of 35 ˚ N , after it had re @-@ curved . The hurricane began to weaken due to increasing upper @-@ level westerlies on August 13 and August 14 , while moving east @-@ northeastward . Alberto was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 14 . 
 As early as August 10 , computer models anticipated the hurricane to accelerate to the northeast and become extratropical within three days , but this did not materialize . A westerly trough that had been influencing Alberto ’ s motion outran the storm , and a strong ridge developed to the north and west , causing the storm to turn abruptly to the south on August 15 , and to complete a large loop over the open Atlantic . Alberto turned to the southwest on August 16 and to the west on August 17 . The storm then took a sharp turn toward the northwest as a large , slow @-@ moving mid @-@ level trough was carving out over the eastern United States . Alberto began to strengthen , and reached hurricane status for the third time on August 18 . The hurricane continued to turn to the north on August 19 and to the northeast on August 20 and August 21 . During this time , Alberto reached a third peak intensity of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) on August 20 , and a 70 mi ( 110 km ) wide eye was observed . Operationally , Alberto reached a peak intensity of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) , but after reanalysis , it was reduced to 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . 
 Hurricane Alberto began to weaken on August 22 as it accelerated into higher latitudes . It was downgraded to a tropical storm early on August 23 . Initially , it was forecast to become extratropical on August 22 , but a little burst of colder cloud tops enabled Alberto to remain tropical for a longer time , persisting into August 23 , while it moved into a very high latitude at 53 ˚ N. The weakening storm finally became extratropical late on August 23 , while accelerating to the north @-@ northeast , passing near Iceland on August 24 . Winds dropped below gale @-@ force , as the centre turned to the east @-@ northeast on August 25 . Alberto dissipated about 85 mi ( 140 km ) east of Jan Mayen later that day . 
 = = Impact , records , and naming = = 
 Very minimal impact occurred as a result from Hurricane Alberto . Dakar , Senegal , received 25 mm ( 1 in ) of rain as the pre @-@ Alberto tropical wave passed over the city . A discussion was issued on August 9 advising residents in Bermuda to monitor the progress of the storm until it safely passed . Also , from August 12 to August 14 , public advisories were issued advising people from Azores to monitor the progress of Hurricane Alberto . This stopped when Alberto began to slow its motion and began to turn to the south , away from the Azores . Some swells were reported along the east coast of the United States a few days after the storm 's recurvature . No reports were available on the impact of Alberto on Iceland , but it was estimated that winds of at least tropical storm force were experienced there . Otherwise , there were no known reports of damage or casualties as a result of Hurricane Alberto . 
 Hurricane Alberto completed the largest loop ever observed over the Atlantic Ocean , spanning approximately 5 degrees latitude by 8 degrees longitude . The storm is currently the ninth longest @-@ lived storm in the Atlantic Ocean ( lasting 19 @.@ 75 days ) , and is also the second longest @-@ lived Atlantic storm during August ( the longest lived is the 1899 Hurricane San Ciriaco ) . Also , Alberto is the third farthest @-@ travelling in the Atlantic ( travelling 6 @,@ 500 miles ) , only behind Hurricane Faith and Hurricane Carrie , being able to retain tropical characteristics at an unusually high latitude , up to 53 ˚ N. The last storm to do so was Hurricane Frances in 1980 . 
 = St Cuthbert Gospel = 
 The St Cuthbert Gospel , also known as the Stonyhurst Gospel or the St Cuthbert Gospel of St John , is an early 8th @-@ century pocket gospel book , written in Latin . Its finely decorated leather binding is the earliest known Western bookbinding to survive , and both the 94 vellum folios and the binding are in outstanding condition for a book of this age . With a page size of only 138 by 92 millimetres ( 5 @.@ 4 in × 3 @.@ 6 in ) the St Cuthbert Gospel is one of the smallest surviving Anglo @-@ Saxon manuscripts . The essentially undecorated text is the Gospel of John in Latin , written in a script that has been regarded as a model of elegant simplicity . 
 The book takes its name from Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne , North East England , in whose tomb it was placed , probably a few years after his death in 687 . Although it was long regarded as Cuthbert 's personal copy of the Gospel , to which there are early references , and so a relic of the saint , the book is now thought to date from shortly after Cuthbert 's death . It was probably a gift from Monkwearmouth @-@ Jarrow Abbey , where it was written , intended to be placed in St Cuthbert 's coffin when his remains were placed behind the altar at Lindisfarne in 698 , or in the next few decades . It presumably remained in the coffin through its long travels after 875 , forced by Viking invasions , ending at Durham Cathedral . The book was found inside the coffin and removed in 1104 when the burial was once again moved within the cathedral . It was kept there with other relics , and important visitors were able to wear the book in a leather bag around their necks . It is thought that after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in England by Henry VIII between 1536 and 1541 , the book passed to collectors . It was eventually given to Stonyhurst College , the Jesuit school in Lancashire . 
 From 1979 it was on long @-@ term loan from the British province of the Jesuit order to the British Library , catalogued as Loan 74 . On 14 July 2011 the British Library launched a fundraising campaign to buy the book for £ 9 million , and on 17 April 2012 announced that the purchase had been completed and the book was now British Library Additional MS <unk> . 
 The library plans to display the Gospel for equal amounts of time in London and Durham . They describe the manuscript as " the earliest surviving intact European book and one of the world 's most significant books " . The Cuthbert Gospel returned to Durham to feature in exhibitions in 2013 and 2014 and will next be on display in the British Library in the summer of 2015 . A new book on the gospel was published in 2015 , incorporating the results of research since the purchase ; among other things this pushed the likely date from the late 7th to the early 8th century . 
 = = Description = = 
 The St Cuthbert Gospel is a pocket @-@ sized book , 138 by 92 millimetres ( 5 @.@ 4 × 3 @.@ 6 in ) , of the Gospel of St John written in uncial script on 94 vellum folios . It is bound in wooden cover boards , covered with tooled red leather . 
 = = = Context = = = 
 The St Cuthbert Gospel is significant both intrinsically as the earliest surviving European book complete with its original binding and by association with the 7th century Anglo @-@ Saxon saint , Cuthbert of Lindisfarne . A miniature in the Codex Amiatinus , of the Prophet Ezra writing in his library , shows several books similarly bound in red decorated with geometric designs . This miniature was probably based on an original in the Codex <unk> , a lost imported Italian Bible at Jarrow , which showed Cassiodorus and the nine volumes he wrote of commentary on the Bible . Whether the bindings depicted , which were presumably of leather , included raised elements cannot be detected , but the books are stored singly flat in a cupboard , which would reduce the wear on any raised patterns . 
 Early medieval treasure bindings with a structure in precious metal , and often containing gems , carved ivory panels or metal reliefs , are perhaps better known today than leather bindings , but these were for books used in church services or as " book @-@ icons " rather than for use in libraries . Of treasure bindings from this period , only the lower cover of the Lindau Gospels ( 750 – 800 , Morgan Library ) now survives complete , though there are several references to them , most famously to that of the Book of Kells , which was lost after a theft in 1007 . Various metal fragments of what were probably book @-@ mounts have survived , usually adapted as jewellery by Vikings . In the context of the cult of Cuthbert , the lavishly illuminated Lindisfarne Gospels were made at Lindisfarne , probably shortly after the St Cuthbert Gospel , with covers involving metalwork , perhaps entirely made in it , which are also now lost . <unk> very early bindings in leather are almost as rare as treasure bindings , as the bindings of books in libraries usually wore out and needed to be renewed , and earlier collectors did not consider most historical bindings worth retaining . 
 = = = Text = = = 
 The text is a very good and careful copy of the single Gospel of John from what has been called the " Italo @-@ Northumbrian " family of texts , other well @-@ known examples of which are several manuscripts from Wearmouth @-@ Jarrow , including the Codex Amiatinus , and in the British Library the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Gospel Book MS Royal 1 . B. VII . This family is presumed to have derived from a hypothetical " Neapolitan <unk> " brought to England by Adrian of Canterbury , a companion of Theodore of Tarsus who Bede says had been abbot of Nisida , an equally hypothetical monastery near Naples . In the rubrics of the Lindisfarne Gospels are several that are " specifically Neapolitan " , including festivals which were celebrated only in Naples such as The Nativity of St. <unk> and the Dedication of the Basilica of Stephen . The Neapolitan manuscript was probably at Wearmouth @-@ Jarrow . 
 Apart from enlarged and sometimes slightly elaborated initials opening the Ammonian sections ( the contemporary equivalent of the modern division into verses ) , and others in red at the start of chapters , the text has no illumination or decoration , but Sir David Wilson , historian of Anglo @-@ Saxon art and Director of the British Museum , used it as his example in writing " some manuscripts are so beautifully written that illumination would seem only to spoil them " . Julian Brown wrote that " the capitular uncial of the Stonyhurst Gospel owes its beauty to simple design and perfect execution . The decorative elements in the script never interfere with the basic structure of the letter @-@ forms ; they arise naturally from the slanted angle at which the pen was held " . 
 The pages with the text have been ruled with a blind stylus or similar tool , leaving just an impression in the vellum . It can be shown that this was done for each gathering with just two sets of lines , ruled on the outermost and innermost pages , requiring a very firm impression to carry the marks through to the sheets behind . Impressed lines mark the vertical edges of the text area , and there is an outer pair of lines . Each line of text is ruled , only as far as the inner vertical lines , and there are prick marks where the horizontal lines meet the verticals . The book begins with 19 lines on a page , but at folio 42 changes to 20 lines per page , requiring the re @-@ ruling of some pages . This change was evidently a departure from the original plan , and may have been caused by a shortage of the very fine vellum , as two different sorts are used , though the change does not coincide exactly with the change in the number of lines . 
 Four passages are marked in the margin , which correspond to those used as readings in Masses for the Dead in the Roman lectionary of the mid @-@ 7th century . This seems to have been done hastily , as most left offset marks on the opposite pages from the book being closed before the ink was dry . This seems to indicate that the book was used at least once as the gospel book for a Mass for the Dead , perhaps on the occasion of Cuthbert 's elevation in 698 . In the example illustrated at left , the start of the reading at line 10 is marked with a cross , and de mortuorum ( " for the dead " ) written beside . The reading ends on the next page , which is also marked . 
 = = = Binding = = = 
 The original tooled red goatskin binding is the earliest surviving intact Western binding , and the virtually unique survivor of decorated Insular leatherwork . The decoration of the front cover includes colour , and the main motif is raised , which is unique among the few surviving Early Medieval bindings . The panels of geometrical decoration with two @-@ stranded interlace closely relate to Insular illuminated manuscripts , and can be compared to the carpet pages found in these . Elements of the design also relate to Anglo @-@ Saxon metalwork in the case of the general origin of interlace in manuscripts , and Coptic and other East Mediterranean designs . 
 The decoration of the covers includes three pigments filling lines engraved with a sharp pointed instrument , which now appear as two shades of yellow , one bright and the other pale , and a dark colour that now appears as blue @-@ grey , but was recorded as blue in the earliest descriptions . The front cover includes all three colours , but the pale yellow is not used on the back cover . The pigments have been analysed for the first time , as one benefit of the purchase of the manuscript by the British Library , and identified by Raman spectroscopy as orpiment ( yellow ) and indigo ( grey @-@ blue ) . The balance of the designs on both covers is now affected by what appears to be the greater fading of the dark blue @-@ grey pigment . The bookbinder Roger Powell speculated that the " pale lemon @-@ yellow ... may once have been green " , giving an original colour scheme of blue , green and yellow on the red background , although the recent testing suggests this was not the case . 
 Given the lack of surviving objects , we cannot know how common the techniques employed were , but the quality of the execution suggests that the binder was experienced in them . At the same time an analysis by Robert <unk> suggests that the designs for both covers were intended to follow a sophisticated geometric scheme of compass and straightedge constructions using the " two true measures of geometry " , the ratio between Pythagoras ' constant and one , and the golden section . However slips in the complicated process of production , some detailed below , mean that the finished covers do not quite exhibit the intended proportions , and are both slightly out of true in some respects . 
 Although it seems clear from the style of the script that the text was written at Monkwearmouth @-@ Jarrow , it is possible that the binding was then added at Lindisfarne ; the form of the plant scrolls can be compared to those on the portable altar also found in Cuthbert 's coffin , presumed to have been made there , though also to other works of the period , such as the shaft of an Anglo @-@ Saxon cross from Penrith and the Vespasian Psalter . Small holes in the folds of each gathering seem to represent a " temporary sewing " together of the pages , one explanation of which is a journey made by the unbound pages . 
 = = = = Front cover = = = = 
 The decoration of the front cover is divided into fields bordered by raised lines . The central field contains a plant motif representing a stylised chalice in the centre with a bud and scrolling vine stems leading from it , fruit and several small leaves . Above and below the central motif are fields containing interlace ornament in finely incised lines . The three motifs are enclosed within a border containing further interlacing . 
 Continuous vine scrolls in a great variety of designs of the same general type as the central motif , with few leaves and round fruits , were very common in slightly later religious Anglo @-@ Saxon art , and are often combined with interlace in the same work , especially on Anglo @-@ Saxon crosses , for example the Bewcastle Cross and the Easby Cross now in the Victoria and Albert Museum . One face of the fragmentary silver cover of the portable altar also recovered from Cuthbert 's coffin has a similar combination of elements , with both areas of interlace and , in the four corners , a simple plant motif with a central bud or leaf and a spiral shoot on either side . The combination of different types of ornament within a panelled framework is highly typical of Northumbrian art , above all the Lindisfarne Gospels . <unk> may well have still been believed to have some quasi @-@ magical protective power , which seems to have been its function in pre @-@ Christian Germanic art . The vine motif here differs from the common continuous scroll type in that the stems cross over each other twice on each side , but crossing stems are also seen on the upper north face of the Bewcastle Cross and a cross in the church at Hexham . Meyer Schapiro compares the motif with one in an initial in the later Book of Kells . It was suggested by Berthe van <unk> that in the St Cuthbert Gospel this design represents Christ ( as the central bud ) and the Four Evangelists as the grapes , following John 15 : 5 , " I am the vine , ye are the branches " , but this idea has been treated with caution by other scholars . 
 The two panels of interlace use the same design , of what David H. Wright describes as the " alternating pair thin @-@ line type " which he calls " perhaps the most sophisticated of Insular interlace types " . The panels are symmetrical about a vertical axis , except for the left end of the upper panel , which is different . Whereas the other ends of the pattern finish in a flat line parallel with the vertical framing line , part of a shape like an incomplete D , the top left finishes in two ellipses pointing into the corners . The lines forming the interlace patterns are coloured in the dark blue / black and the bright yellow , but differently . In the lower panel the yellow colours the left half of the design , but the upper panel begins at the ( deviant ) left in the dark colour , then switches to yellow once the pattern changes to that used for the rest of the panels . It continues in yellow until the central point , then changes to the dark colour for the right hand side of the design . 
 The transition between the top left , perhaps where the artist began , and the standard pattern , is somewhat awkward , leaving a rather bald spot ( for an interlace pattern ) to the left of the first curving yellow vertical . The change in pattern pushes the halfway point of the upper panel rather off @-@ centre to the right , whereas in the lower panel it falls slightly to the left of dead centre . These vagaries in the design suggest that it was done freehand , without marking @-@ out the pattern using compasses for example . The lowest horizontal raised line is not straight , being higher at the left , probably because of an error in the marking or drilling of the holes in the cover board through which the ends of the cord run . The simple twist or chain border in yellow between the two raised frames resembles an element in an initial in the Durham Gospel Book Fragment , an important earlier manuscript from Lindisfarne .

 The back cover is decorated more simply , with no raised elements and purely geometric decoration of engraved lines , which are filled in with two pigments which now appear as the bright yellow and the dark colour , once apparently blue . Within several framing lines making rectangles of similar proportions to the cover itself , a central rectangular panel is marked with pricks to make a grid of <unk> squares , 21 tall and 10 wide . Lines on the grid are engraved and coloured in yellow to form two stepped " crosses " , or squares standing on one corner , with additional stepped elements in the four corners and half @-@ way up the vertical sides , between the two " crosses " . The vertical axial line down the grid and the two horizontal axes through the crosses are also coloured in the yellow pigment right to the edges of the grid . The remaining lines on the grid and all the lines along the edges of the grid are coloured in the dark colour . This is a simple version of the sort of design found on Insular carpet pages , as well as in Coptic manuscript decoration and textiles , and small stepped crosses decorate the main panels of the famous Sutton Hoo shoulder @-@ clasps . The alignment of the various outer framing lines with the innermost frame and the panel with the grid is noticeably imperfect , as the top framing line was extended too far to the left . Traces of an <unk> first attempt at this line can be seen on the right hand side , above the coloured line . 
 = = = = Construction = = = = 
 Although the binding has never been taken apart for examination , a considerable amount can be said about its construction . A combination of looseness through wear and tear , damage in certain places , and the failure of the paste that glued the pages to the inside of the covers , now allow non @-@ intrusive inspection of much of the binding construction , including the rear of the actual wooden front cover board , and some of the holes made through it . 
 The raised framing lines can be seen from the rear of the front cover to have been produced by gluing cord to the board and tooling the leather over it , in a technique of Coptic origin , of which few early examples survive – one of the closest is a 9th- or 10th @-@ century Islamic binding found in the Mosque of <unk> in Kairouan , Tunisia . There are holes in the board in which the cut @-@ off ends can be seen from behind . 
 The chalice and plant motif on the front , of which there is no trace from behind , has been built up using some clay @-@ like material underneath the leather , as shown by CT @-@ scans since the purchase . In the 2015 book Nicholas <unk> suggests that this raised decoration was formed using a matrix which was pressed into the damp leather over the clay @-@ like substance and the wooden board . Previous authors had suggested that the material under the relief decoration might have been built up in gesso as well as cord and leather scraps before applying the cover leather . A broadly similar plant motif in similar technique is found on a later Middle Eastern pouch in the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore . 
 The boards of the covers , previously assumed to be <unk> , are now thought to be birch , an unusual wood in later bindings , but one easily available in northern England . Both have four holes where the binding threads were laced through ; the two threads were run round the inner edges of the cover and knotted back at the holes . The front cover has an additional 12 holes where the ends of the cords for the raised framing lines went through , at the four corners of the two main frames , and the ends of the horizontal bars between the interlace panels and the central vine motif . 
 The stitching of the binding uses " Coptic sewing " , that is " flexible unsupported sewing ( produced by two needles and thread looping round one another in a figure @-@ of @-@ eight sewing pattern ) " Coptic sewing uses small threads both to attach the leaves together and , knotted together , to attach the pages to the cover boards . Normal Western binding uses thread for the former and thicker cord running across the spine of the book for the latter , with the thread knotted onto the cords . Coptic sewing is also found in the earliest surviving leather <unk> , which are from Coptic libraries in Egypt from the 7th and 8th centuries ; in particular the design of the cover of one in the Morgan Library ( MS <unk> ) has been compared to the St Cuthbert Gospel . In the techniques used in the binding , apart from the raised decoration , the closest resemblance is to an even smaller Irish pocket gospel book from some 50 years later , the <unk> Gospels at Fulda , which is believed to have belonged to Saint Boniface . This is also in red goatskin , with coloured incised lines , and uses a similar unsupported or cordless stitching technique . The first appearance of the cords or supports that these " unsupported " bindings lack is found in two other books at Fulda , and they soon became universal in , and characteristic of , Western bookbinding until the arrival of modern machine techniques . The cords run horizontally across the spine , and are thicker than the threads that hold the pages together . They are attached , typically by lacing through holes or glue , to the two boards of the cover , and the threads holding the gatherings are knotted to them , resulting in a stronger binding . 
 = = Dating = = 
 The manuscript itself carries no date but a rather precise dating has been given to it , based mainly on its palaeography or handwriting , and also the known facts of Cuthbert 's burial . The dating was revised after the acquisition by the British Library , who added to their online catalogue entry : 
 Previously dated to the end of the 7th century ( The Stonyhurst Gospel , ed . T. J. Brown ( 1969 ) , pp. 12 – 13 ) , R. <unk> dates the script to c . 710 – c . 730 and L. Webster dates the decoration on the covers to c . 700 – c . 730 ( The St Cuthbert Gospel , eds C. Breay and B. Meehan ( 2015 ) , pp. 33 , 80 ) . 
 The script is the " capitular " form of uncial , with just a few emphasized letters at the start of sections in " text " uncial . Close analysis of the changing style of details of the forms of letters allows the manuscript to be placed with some confidence within a chronological sequence of the few other manuscripts thought to have been produced at Wearmouth @-@ Jarrow . The Northumbrian scribes " imitate very closely the best Italian manuscripts of about the sixth century " , but introduced small elements that gave their script a distinct style , which has always been greatly admired . However , there were several scribes , seven different ones working on the Codex Amiatinus , whose scripts may not all have developed at the same pace . 
 Key to this sequence is the Codex Amiatinus , an almost complete Bible for which we have a very precise terminus ante quem , and within which , because of its size , developments in style can be seen in a single manuscript . The Codex Amiatinus can be precisely located as leaving Wearmouth @-@ Jarrow with a party led by Abbot Ceolfrith on 4 June 716 , bound for Rome . The codex was to be presented to the pope , a decision only announced by Ceolfrith very shortly before the departure , allowing the dedication page to be dated with confidence to around May 716 , though the rest of the manuscript was probably already some years old , but only begun after Ceolfrith succeeded as abbot in 689 . The script of the dedication page differs slightly from that of the main text , but is by the same hand and in the same " elaborated text uncial " style as some pages at Durham ( MS A II 17 , part ii , ff 103 @-@ 11 ) . At the end of the sequence , it may be possible to date the Saint Petersburg Bede to 746 at the earliest , from references in memoranda in the text , although this remains a matter of controversy . 
 There survive parts of a gospel book , by coincidence now bound up with the famous Utrecht Psalter , which are identifiable as by the same scribe as the Cuthbert Gospel , and where " the capitular uncial of the two manuscripts is indistinguishable in style or quality , so they may well be very close to each other in date " . Since the Utrecht pages also use Rustic capital script , which the Cuthbert Gospel does not , it allows another basis for comparison with further manuscripts in the sequence . 
 From the palaeographical evidence , T. Julian Brown concluded that the Cuthbert manuscript was written after the main text of the Codex Amiatinus , which was finished after 688 , perhaps by 695 , though it might be later . Turning to the historical evidence for Cuthbert 's burial , this placed it after his original burial in 687 but possibly before his elevation to the high altar in 698 . If this is correct , the book was never a personal possession of Cuthbert , as has sometimes been thought , but was possibly created specifically to be placed in his coffin , whether for the occasion of his elevation in 698 or at another date . The less precise hints about dating that can be derived from the style of the binding compared to other works did not conflict with these conclusions , though in the new 2015 study , Leslie Webster now dates the cover to " c . 700 – c . 730 " , and Richard <unk> " dates the script to c . 710 – c . 730 " , as quoted above . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Cuthbert was an Anglo @-@ Saxon , perhaps of a noble family , born in the Kingdom of Northumbria in the mid @-@ 630s , some ten years after the conversion of King Edwin to Christianity in 627 , which was slowly followed by that of the rest of his people . The politics of the kingdom were violent , and there were later episodes of pagan rule , while spreading understanding of Christianity through the kingdom was a task that lasted throughout Cuthbert 's lifetime . Edwin had been baptised by Paulinus of York , an Italian who had come with the Gregorian mission from Rome , but his successor Oswald also invited Irish monks from Iona to found the monastery at Lindisfarne where Cuthbert was to spend much of his life . This was around 635 , about the time Cuthbert was born . 
 The tension between the Roman and Irish traditions , often exacerbated by Cuthbert 's near @-@ contemporary Saint Wilfrid , an intransigent and quarrelsome supporter of Roman ways , was to be a major feature of Cuthbert 's lifetime . Cuthbert himself , though educated in the Irish tradition , followed his mentor Eata in accepting the Roman forms without apparent difficulty after the Synod of Whitby in 664 . The earliest biographies concentrate on the many miracles that accompanied even his early life , but he was evidently indefatigable as a travelling priest spreading the Christian message to remote villages , and also well able to impress royalty and nobility . Unlike Wilfrid , his style of life was austere , and when he was able to he lived the life of a hermit , though still receiving many visitors . 
 He grew up near the new Melrose Abbey , an offshoot from Lindisfarne which is today in Scotland , but was then in Northumbria . He had decided to become a monk after seeing a vision on the night in 651 that St Aidan , the founder of Lindisfarne , died , but seems to have seen some military service first . He was quickly made guest @-@ master at the new monastery at Ripon , soon after 655 , but had to return with Eata to Melrose when Wilfrid was given the monastery instead . About 662 he was made prior at Melrose , and around 665 went as prior to Lindisfarne . In 684 he was made Bishop of Lindisfarne but by late 686 resigned and returned to his hermitage as he felt he was about to die , although he was probably still only in his early 50s . After a few weeks of illness he died on the island on 20 March 687 , and his body was carried back to Lindisfarne and buried there the same day . 
 = = = Lindisfarne = = = 
 Although first documented in 1104 , the book is presumed to have been buried with Cuthbert at Lindisfarne either in 687 or more likely in 698 , and to have stayed with the body during the wanderings forced by the Viking invasions two centuries later . Bede 's Life recounts that Cuthbert was initially buried in a stone sarcophagus to the right of the altar in the church at Lindisfarne ; he had wanted to be buried at the hermitage on Inner Farne Island where he died , but before his death was persuaded to allow his burial at the main monastery . His burial was first disturbed eleven years after his death , when his remains were moved to behind the altar to reflect his recognition , in the days before a formal process of canonisation , as a saint . The sarcophagus was opened and his body was said to have been found perfectly preserved , or <unk> . This apparent miracle led to the steady growth of Cuthbert 's posthumous cult , to the point where he became the most popular saint of Northern England . 
 Numerous miracles were attributed to his intercession and to intercessory prayer near his remains . In particular , Alfred the Great , King of Wessex , was inspired and encouraged in his struggle against the Danes by a vision or dream he had of Cuthbert . Thereafter the royal house of Wessex , who became the kings of England , made a point of devotion to Cuthbert , which also had a useful political message , as they came from opposite ends of the united English kingdom . Cuthbert was " a figure of reconciliation and a rallying point for the reformed identity of Northumbria and England " after the absorption of the Danish populations into Anglo @-@ Saxon society , as Michelle Brown puts it . The 8th @-@ century historian Bede wrote both a verse and a prose life of St Cuthbert around 720 . He has been described as " perhaps the most popular saint in England prior to the death of Thomas Becket in 1170 . " Cuthbert was reburied in the decorated oak coffin now usually meant by St Cuthbert 's coffin , though he was to have many more coffins , and it is thought likely that the book was produced for this occasion , and may well have been placed in his coffin at this point . 
 = = = Fleeing the Danes = = = 
 In 793 Lindisfarne was devastated by the first serious Viking raid in England , but Cuthbert 's shrine seems to have escaped damage . In 875 the Danish leader <unk> ( Halfdan Ragnarsson ) , who shared with his brother Ivar the Boneless the leadership of the Great Heathen Army that had conquered much of the south of England , moved north to spend the winter there , as a prelude to settlement and further conquest . Eardulf , the Bishop of Lindisfarne , decided the monastery must be abandoned , and orderly preparations were made for the whole community , including lay people and children , to evacuate . 
 It was possibly at this point that a shelf or inner cover was inserted some way under the lid of Cuthbert 's coffin , supported on three wooden bars across the width , and probably with two iron rings fixed to it for lifting it off . Eardulf had decided to take the most important remains and possessions of the community with them , and whether new or old , the shelf in Cuthbert 's coffin was probably loaded with the St Cuthbert Gospel , which was found there in 1104 . It may also have held the Lindisfarne Gospels , now also in the British Library , and other books from Lindisfarne that were , and in several cases still are , at Durham Cathedral . Other bones taken by the party were those remains of St Aidan ( d . 651 ) , the founder of the community , that had not been sent to Melrose , and the head of the king and saint Oswald of Northumbria , who had converted the kingdom and encouraged the founding of Lindisfarne . These and other relics were reverently packaged in cloth and labelled , as more recent relics are . The community also took a stone Anglo @-@ Saxon cross , and although they had a <unk> of some sort , probably a cart or simple wagon , Cuthbert 's coffin was carried by seven young men who had grown up in the community . 
 They set off inland and spent the first months at an unknown location in west Cumberland , near the River Derwent , probably in the modern Lake District , and according to Symeon of Durham 's Libellus de <unk> , the main source for this period , Eardulf tried to hire a ship on the west coast to take them to Ireland . Then they left the more remote west side of the country and returned to the east , finding a resting @-@ place at <unk> near Easington , County Durham , close to the coast , well south of Lindisfarne , but also sufficiently far north of the new Viking kingdom being established at York . 
 Over the next century the Vikings of York and the north became gradually Christianized , and Cuthbert 's shrine became a focus of devotion among them also . The community established close relations with <unk> ( d . 895 ) , <unk> 's successor as king , and received land from him at Chester @-@ le @-@ Street . In 883 they moved the few miles there , where they stayed over a century , building St Cuthbert 's Church , where Cuthbert 's shrine was placed . In 995 a new Danish invasion led the community to flee some 50 miles south to Ripon , again taking the coffin with them . After three or four months it was felt safe to return , and the party had nearly reached Chester @-@ le @-@ Street when their wagon became definitively stuck close to Durham , then a place with cultivated fields , but hardly a settlement , perhaps just an isolated farm . It was thought that Cuthbert was expressing a wish to settle where he was , and the community obeyed . A new stone church — the so @-@ called White Church — was built , the predecessor of the present Durham Cathedral . 
 = = = Durham Cathedral = = = 
 In 1104 , early in the bishopric of Ranulf Flambard , Cuthbert 's tomb was opened again and his relics translated to a new shrine behind the main altar of the half @-@ built Norman cathedral . According to the earlier of the two accounts of the event that survive , known as " Miracles 18 – 20 " or the " anonymous account " , written by a monk of the cathedral , when the monks opened the decorated inner coffin , which was for the first time in living memory , they saw " a book of the Gospels lying at the head of the board " , that is on the shelf or inner lid . The account in " Miracle 20 " adds that Bishop Flambard , during his sermon on the day the new shrine received Cuthbert 's body , showed the congregation " a Gospel of Saint John in miraculously perfect condition , which had a satchel @-@ like container of red leather with a badly frayed sling made of silken threads " . In addition the book itself has an inscription on folio <unk> " written in a modest book @-@ hand apparently of the later twelfth century " recording that it was found in the translation . 
 As far as is known the book remained at Durham for the remainder of the Middle Ages , until the Dissolution , kept as a relic in three bags of red leather , normally resting in a reliquary , and there are various records of it being shown to visitors , the more distinguished of which were allowed to hang it round their neck for a while . According to Reginald of Durham ( d. c 1190 ) " anyone approaching it should wash , fast and dress in an alb before touching it " , and he recorded that a scribe called John who failed to do this during a visit by the Archbishop of York in 1153 – 54 , and " held it with unwashed hands after eating was struck down with a chill " . Books treated as relics are especially characteristic of Celtic Christianity ; several of the surviving Irish book @-@ shrines were worn in this way . 
 Another recorded copy of the Gospel of John has also been associated with Cuthbert , and sometimes thought to be the St Cuthbert Gospel . Saint Boisil ( d . 664 ) of Melrose Abbey was Cuthbert 's teacher . Bede 's prose life of Cuthbert records that during Boisil 's last illness , he and Cuthbert read daily one of the seven gatherings or quaternions of Boisil 's manuscript of the Gospel of John . The sermon in Miracle 20 identifies this manuscript with the one at Durham , and says that both saints had worn it round their necks , ignoring that it has twelve gatherings rather than seven . There are further references from Durham to Boisil 's book , such as a list of relics in the cathedral in 1389 , and some modern scholars were attracted to the idea that they were the same , but Brown 's palaeographical evidence seems to remove the possibility of Boisil 's book being the St Cuthbert Gospel . In the 11th century Boisil 's remains had also been brought to Durham , and enshrined next to those of Cuthbert . Around the same time Bede 's own remains were stolen from Monkwearmouth @-@ Jarrow for Durham , by a " notably underhand trick " , and placed in Cuthbert 's coffin , where they remained until 1104 . 
 = = = After the Reformation = = = 
 It is thought likely that the book remained at Durham until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII , although the various late medieval records of books and relics held there do not allow it to be identified with certainty . Durham Cathedral Priory closed in 1540 , and some decades later the book was recorded by Archbishop Ussher in the library of the Oxford scholar , antiquary and astrologer , Thomas Allen ( 1542 – 1632 ) of Gloucester Hall ( now Worcester College , Oxford ) . However it is not in a catalogue of Allen 's library of 1622 , and was not in the collection of Allen 's manuscripts that was presented to the Bodleian Library by Sir Kenelm Digby in 1634 . Nothing is then known of its whereabouts for a century or so . 
 According to an 18th @-@ century Latin inscription pasted to the inside cover of the manuscript , the St Cuthbert Gospel was given by the 3rd Earl of Lichfield ( 1718 – 1772 ) to the Jesuit priest Thomas Phillips S.J. ( 1708 – 1774 ) who donated it to the English Jesuit College at Liège on 20 June 1769 . Lichfield was an Anglican , but knew Phillips as the latter was chaplain to his neighbour in Oxfordshire , the recusant George Talbot , 14th Earl of Shrewsbury ( 1719 – 1787 ) . The manuscript was owned between 1769 and 2012 by the British Province of the Society of Jesus , and for most of this period was in the library of Stonyhurst College , Lancashire , successor to the Liège college . 
 The manuscript was first published when in 1806 it was taken to London and displayed when a letter on it by the Rev. J. Milner , presumably Bishop John Milner , Catholic Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District , was read to a meeting of the London Society of Antiquaries , which was subsequently printed in their journal Archaeologia . Milner followed the medieval note in relating the book to Cuthbert , and compared its script to that of the Lindisfarne Gospels , by then in the British Museum , examining the two side by side . However he thought that " the binding seems to be of the time of Queen Elizabeth " ! After the lecture it took some years to return to Stonyhurst as an intermediary forgot to forward it . That the binding was original , and the earliest European example , was realised during the 19th century , and when exhibited in 1862 it was described in the catalogue as " In unique coeval ( ? ) binding " . The whole appearance and feel of the book , and the accuracy of the text and beauty of the script was highly praised by scholars such as Bishop Christopher Wordsworth ( 1807 – 1885 ) , nephew of the poet and an important New Testament textual scholar , who described the book as " surpassing in delicate simplicity of neatness every manuscript that I have seen " . 
 = = = From 1950 = = = 
 From 1950 onwards the binding was examined several times , but not altered , at Stonyhurst and the British Museum by Roger Powell , " the leading bookbinder of his day " , who had rebound both the Book of Kells and the Book of Durrow , and also fully photographed by Peter Walters . Powell contributed chapters on the binding to the two major works covering the book , the first being The Relics of St Cuthbert in 1956 , a large work with chapters on Cuthbert 's coffin and each of the objects recovered from it . The main chapter on the St Cuthbert Gospel was by Sir Roger <unk> , and Powell 's chapter incorporated unpublished observations by the leading bindings expert Geoffrey Hobson . The second came in 1969 , when T.J. ( Julian ) Brown , Professor of Palaeography at King 's College , London , published a monograph on the St Cuthbert Gospel with another chapter by Powell , who had altered his views in minor respects . Brown set out arguments for the dating of the manuscript to close to 698 , which has been generally accepted . The book was placed on loan to the British Library in 1979 where it was very regularly on display , first in the British Museum building , and from 1999 in the Ritblat Gallery at the new St Pancras site of the Library , usually displaying the front cover . Despite minor damages , some of which appear to have occurred during the 20th century , the book is in extremely good condition for its age . 
 In 2011 an agreement was reached with the Jesuit British Province for the British Library to buy the book for £ 9 million . This required the purchase money to be raised by 31 March 2012 , and a public appeal was launched . In the early stages the emphasis was on raising large individual donations , which included £ 4 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 from the National Heritage Memorial Fund , which distributes some of the money from the profits of the National Lottery , £ 250 @,@ 000 pledged by the Art Fund , and " a similar sum " by The Garfield Weston Foundation , and a large gift from the Foyle Foundation . By early March 2012 the British Library reported that there was " only £ 1.5M left to raise " , and on 17 April announced that the purchase had been completed , after their largest ever public appeal . The purchase " involved a formal partnership between the Library , Durham University and Durham Cathedral and an agreement that the book will be displayed to the public equally in London and the North East . " There was a special display at the British Library until June 2012 , and after coming off display for detailed investigation the book is planned to go on display in Durham in July 2013 in Durham University ’ s Palace Green Library . All the pages are accessible on the British Library website . 
 = = The Gospel of John as an amulet = = 
 There was a long and somewhat controversial tradition of using manuscripts of the gospel of John , or extracts such as the opening verse , as a protective or healing amulet or charm , which was especially strong in early medieval Britain and Ireland . Manuscripts containing the text of one gospel only are very rare , except for those with lengthy explanatory glosses , and all the examples known to Julian Brown were of John . <unk> references to such uses can be found in the writings of Saints Jerome and Eligius , and Alcuin , but they are accepted by John Chrysostom , Augustine , who " expresses qualified approval " of using manuscripts as a cure for headaches , and Gregory the Great , who sent one to Queen <unk> for her son . Bede 's prose Life mentions that Cuthbert combated the use of amulets and charms in the villages around Melrose . However , like many other leading figures of the church , he may have distinguished between amulets based on Christian texts and symbols and other types . 
 The size of the Cuthbert Gospel places it within the Insular tradition of the " pocket gospels " , of which eight Irish examples survive , including the Book of <unk> , Book of <unk> , and Book of Deer , although all the others are or were originally texts of all four gospels , with the possible exception of a few pages from the Gospel of John enshrined with the Stowe Missal in its <unk> or book @-@ reliquary . There was a tradition of even smaller books , whose use seems to have been often <unk> , and a manuscript of John alone , with a page size of 72 x 56 mm , was found in a reliquary at Chartres Cathedral in 1712 . It is probably Italian from the 5th or 6th century , and the label it carried in 1712 saying it was a relic of St <unk> , a bishop of <unk> who died in about 556 , may be correct . The other examples are mostly in Greek or the Coptic language and contain a variety of biblical texts , especially psalters . Julian Brown concludes that the three Latin manuscripts of John " seem to attest an early medieval practice of placing a complete Gospel of St. John in a shrine , as a protective amulet ; and it seems reasonable to conclude that our manuscript was placed in St. Cuthbert 's coffin to protect it " .

 = Titanium = 
 Titanium is a chemical element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22 . It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color , low density and high strength . It is highly resistant to corrosion in sea water , aqua regia , and chlorine . 
 Titanium was discovered in Cornwall , Great Britain , by William Gregor in 1791 and named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth for the Titans of Greek mythology . The element occurs within a number of mineral deposits , principally rutile and ilmenite , which are widely distributed in the Earth 's crust and lithosphere , and it is found in almost all living things , rocks , water bodies , and soils . The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes . The most common compound , titanium dioxide , is a popular <unk> and is used in the manufacture of white pigments . Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride ( TiCl4 ) , a component of smoke screens and catalysts ; and titanium trichloride ( <unk> ) , which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene . 
 Titanium can be alloyed with iron , aluminium , vanadium , and molybdenum , among other elements , to produce strong , lightweight alloys for aerospace ( jet engines , missiles , and spacecraft ) , military , industrial process ( chemicals and <unk> @-@ chemicals , desalination plants , pulp , and paper ) , automotive , agri @-@ food , medical prostheses , orthopedic implants , dental and <unk> instruments and files , dental implants , sporting goods , jewelry , mobile phones , and other applications . 
 The two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and the highest strength @-@ to @-@ density ratio of any metallic element . In its unalloyed condition , titanium is as strong as some steels , but less dense . There are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element , <unk> through 50Ti , with 48Ti being the most abundant ( 73 @.@ 8 % ) . Although they have the same number of valence electrons and are in the same group in the periodic table , titanium and zirconium differ in many chemical and physical properties . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Physical properties = = = 
 A metallic element , titanium is recognized for its high strength @-@ to @-@ weight ratio . It is a strong metal with low density that is quite ductile ( especially in an oxygen @-@ free environment ) , lustrous , and metallic @-@ white in color . The relatively high melting point ( more than 1 @,@ 650 ° C or 3 @,@ 000 ° F ) makes it useful as a refractory metal . It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity . 
 Commercial ( 99 @.@ 2 % pure ) grades of titanium have ultimate tensile strength of about 434 MPa ( 63 @,@ 000 psi ) , equal to that of common , low @-@ grade steel alloys , but are less dense . Titanium is 60 % denser than aluminium , but more than twice as strong as the most commonly used 6061 @-@ T6 aluminium alloy . Certain titanium alloys ( e.g. , Beta C ) achieve tensile strengths of over 1400 MPa ( 200000 psi ) . However , titanium loses strength when heated above 430 ° C ( 806 ° F ) . 
 Titanium is not as hard as some grades of heat @-@ treated steel , is non @-@ magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity . Machining requires precautions , because the material might gall if sharp tools and proper cooling methods are not used . Like those made from steel , titanium structures have a fatigue limit that guarantees longevity in some applications . Titanium alloys have less stiffness than many other structural materials such as aluminium alloys and carbon fiber . 
 The metal is a dimorphic allotrope of an hexagonal α form that changes into a body @-@ centered cubic ( lattice ) β form at 882 ° C ( 1 @,@ 620 ° F ) . The specific heat of the α form increases dramatically as it is heated to this transition temperature but then falls and remains fairly constant for the β form regardless of temperature . Similar to zirconium and hafnium , an additional omega phase exists , which is thermodynamically stable at high pressures , but is metastable at ambient pressures . This phase is usually hexagonal ( ideal ) or trigonal ( distorted ) and can be considered to be due to a soft longitudinal acoustic phonon of the β phase causing collapse of ( 111 ) planes of atoms . 
 = = = Chemical properties = = = 
 Like aluminium and magnesium , titanium metal and its alloys oxidize immediately upon exposure to air . Titanium readily reacts with oxygen at 1 @,@ 200 ° C ( 2 @,@ 190 ° F ) in air , and at 610 ° C ( 1 @,@ 130 ° F ) in pure oxygen , forming titanium dioxide . It is , however , slow to react with water and air at ambient temperatures because it forms a passive oxide coating that protects the bulk metal from further oxidation . When it first forms , this protective layer is only 1 – 2 nm thick but continues to grow slowly ; reaching a thickness of 25 nm in four years . 
 Atmospheric passivation gives titanium excellent resistance to corrosion , almost equivalent to platinum , capable of withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids , chloride solutions , and most organic acids . However , titanium is corroded by concentrated acids . As indicated by its negative redox potential , titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point . Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum . At 550 ° C ( 1 @,@ 022 ° F ) , it combines with chlorine . It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen . 
 Titanium is one of the few elements that burns in pure nitrogen gas , reacting at 800 ° C ( 1 @,@ 470 ° F ) to form titanium nitride , which causes embrittlement . Because of its high reactivity with oxygen , nitrogen , and some other gases , titanium filaments are applied in titanium sublimation pumps as scavengers for these gases . Such pumps inexpensively and reliably produce extremely low pressures in ultra @-@ high vacuum systems . 
 = = = Occurrence = = = 
 Titanium is the ninth @-@ most abundant element in Earth 's crust ( 0 @.@ 63 % by mass ) and the seventh @-@ most abundant metal . It is present as oxides in most igneous rocks , in sediments derived from them , in living things , and natural bodies of water . Of the 801 types of igneous rocks analyzed by the United States Geological Survey , 784 contained titanium . Its proportion in soils is approximately 0 @.@ 5 to 1 @.@ 5 % . 
 It is widely distributed and occurs primarily in the minerals anatase , brookite , ilmenite , perovskite , rutile and titanite ( <unk> ) . Of these minerals , only rutile and ilmenite have economic importance , yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations . About 6 @.@ 0 and 0 @.@ 7 million tonnes of those minerals were mined in 2011 , respectively . Significant titanium @-@ bearing ilmenite deposits exist in western Australia , Canada , China , India , Mozambique , New Zealand , Norway , Ukraine and South Africa . About 186 @,@ 000 tonnes of titanium metal sponge were produced in 2011 , mostly in China ( 60 @,@ 000 t ) , Japan ( 56 @,@ 000 t ) , Russia ( 40 @,@ 000 t ) , United States ( 32 @,@ 000 t ) and Kazakhstan ( 20 @,@ 700 t ) . Total reserves of titanium are estimated to exceed 600 million tonnes . 
 The concentration of Ti is about 4 <unk> in the ocean . At 100 ° C , the concentration of titanium in water is estimated to be less than 10 − 7 M at pH 7 . The identity of titanium species in aqueous solution remains unknown because of its low solubility and the lack of sensitive spectroscopic methods , although only the 4 + oxidation state is stable in air . No evidence exists for a biological role , although rare organisms are known to accumulate high concentrations of titanium . 
 Titanium is contained in meteorites and has been detected in the Sun and in M @-@ type stars ( the coolest type ) with a surface temperature of 3 @,@ 200 ° C ( 5 @,@ 790 ° F ) . Rocks brought back from the Moon during the Apollo 17 mission are composed of 12 @.@ 1 % TiO2 . It is also found in coal ash , plants , and even the human body . Native titanium ( pure metallic ) is very rare . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Naturally occurring titanium is composed of 5 stable isotopes : <unk> , <unk> , 48Ti , <unk> , and 50Ti , with 48Ti being the most abundant ( 73 @.@ 8 % natural abundance ) . Eleven radioisotopes have been characterized , the most stable being <unk> with a half @-@ life of 63 years ; <unk> , 184 @.@ 8 minutes ; <unk> , 5 @.@ 76 minutes ; and <unk> , 1 @.@ 7 minutes . All the other radioactive isotopes have half @-@ lives less than 33 seconds and the majority , less than half a second . 
 The isotopes of titanium range in atomic weight from 39 @.@ 99 u ( <unk> ) to 57 @.@ 966 u ( <unk> ) . The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope , 48Ti , is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta emission . The primary decay products before 48Ti are element 21 ( scandium ) isotopes and the primary products after are element 23 ( vanadium ) isotopes . 
 Titanium becomes radioactive upon bombardment with deuterons , emitting mainly positrons and hard gamma rays . 
 = = Compounds = = 
 The + 4 oxidation state dominates titanium chemistry , but compounds in the + 3 oxidation state are also common . Commonly , titanium adopts an octahedral coordination geometry in its complexes , but tetrahedral TiCl4 is a notable exception . Because of its high oxidation state , titanium ( IV ) compounds exhibit a high degree of covalent bonding . Unlike most other transition metals , simple aquo Ti ( IV ) complexes are unknown . 
 = = = Oxides , sulfides , and alkoxides = = = 
 The most important oxide is TiO2 , which exists in three important polymorphs ; anatase , brookite , and rutile . All of these are white diamagnetic solids , although mineral samples can appear dark ( see rutile ) . They adopt polymeric structures in which Ti is surrounded by six oxide ligands that link to other Ti centers . 
 <unk> usually refer to titanium ( IV ) compounds , as represented barium titanate ( <unk> ) . With a perovskite structure , this material exhibits piezoelectric properties and is used as a transducer in the interconversion of sound and electricity . Many minerals are <unk> , e.g. ilmenite ( <unk> ) . Star sapphires and rubies get their asterism ( star @-@ forming shine ) from the presence of titanium dioxide impurities . 
 A variety of reduced oxides of titanium are known . <unk> , described as a Ti ( IV ) <unk> ( III ) species , is a purple semiconductor produced by reduction of TiO2 with hydrogen at high temperatures , and is used industrially when surfaces need to be vapour @-@ coated with titanium dioxide : it evaporates as pure TiO , whereas TiO2 evaporates as a mixture of oxides and deposits coatings with variable refractive index . Also known is <unk> , with the corundum structure , and TiO , with the rock salt structure , although often nonstoichiometric . 
 The alkoxides of titanium ( IV ) , prepared by reacting TiCl4 with alcohols , are colourless compounds that convert to the dioxide on reaction with water . They are industrially useful for depositing solid TiO2 via the sol @-@ gel process . Titanium <unk> is used in the synthesis of chiral organic compounds via the Sharpless epoxidation . 
 Titanium forms a variety of sulfides , but only <unk> has attracted significant interest . It adopts a layered structure and was used as a cathode in the development of lithium batteries . Because Ti ( IV ) is a " hard cation " , the sulfides of titanium are unstable and tend to hydrolyze to the oxide with release of hydrogen sulfide . 
 = = = Nitrides , carbides = = = 
 Titanium nitride ( <unk> ) has a hardness equivalent to sapphire and carborundum ( 9 @.@ 0 on the Mohs Scale ) , and is often used to coat cutting tools , such as drill bits . It is also used as a gold @-@ colored decorative finish and as a barrier metal in semiconductor fabrication . Titanium carbide , which is also very hard , is found in cutting tools and coatings . 
 = = = Halides = = = 
 Titanium tetrachloride ( titanium ( IV ) chloride , TiCl4 ) is a colorless volatile liquid ( commercial samples are yellowish ) that , in air , hydrolyzes with spectacular emission of white clouds . Via the Kroll process , TiCl4 is produced in the conversion of titanium ores to titanium dioxide , e.g. , for use in white paint . It is widely used in organic chemistry as a Lewis acid , for example in the <unk> <unk> condensation . In the van Arkel process , titanium tetraiodide ( <unk> ) is generated in the production of high purity titanium metal . 
 Titanium ( III ) and titanium ( II ) also form stable chlorides . A notable example is titanium ( III ) chloride ( <unk> ) , which is used as a catalyst for production of <unk> ( see Ziegler @-@ Natta catalyst ) and a reducing agent in organic chemistry . 
 = = = Organometallic complexes = = = 
 Owing to the important role of titanium compounds as polymerization catalyst , compounds with Ti @-@ C bonds have been intensively studied . The most common <unk> complex is <unk> dichloride ( ( C5H5 ) <unk> ) . Related compounds include <unk> 's reagent and <unk> reagent . Titanium forms carbonyl complexes , e.g. ( C5H5 ) <unk> ( CO ) 2 . 
 = = History = = 
 Titanium was discovered as an inclusion of a mineral in Cornwall , Great Britain , in 1791 by the clergyman and amateur geologist William Gregor , then vicar of Creed parish . He recognized the presence of a new element in ilmenite when he found black sand by a stream in the nearby parish of <unk> and noticed the sand was attracted by a magnet . Analyzing the sand , he determined the presence of two metal oxides : iron oxide ( explaining the attraction to the magnet ) and 45 @.@ 25 % of a white metallic oxide he could not identify . Realizing that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match any known element , Gregor reported his findings to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall and in the German science journal <unk> 's Annalen . 
 Around the same time , Franz @-@ Joseph Müller von Reichenstein produced a similar substance , but could not identify it . The oxide was independently rediscovered in 1795 by Prussian chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in rutile from <unk> ( German name of unknown place ) village of Hungary ( now in Slovakia ) . Klaproth found that it contained a new element and named it for the Titans of Greek mythology . After hearing about Gregor 's earlier discovery , he obtained a sample of <unk> and confirmed it contained titanium . 
 The currently known processes for extracting titanium from its various ores are laborious and costly ; it is not possible to reduce the ore by heating with carbon ( as in iron smelting ) because titanium combines with the carbon to produce titanium carbide . Pure metallic titanium ( 99 @.@ 9 % ) was first prepared in 1910 by Matthew A. Hunter at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute by heating TiCl4 with sodium at 700 – 800 ° C under great pressure in a batch process known as the Hunter process . Titanium metal was not used outside the laboratory until 1932 when William Justin Kroll proved that it could be produced by reducing titanium tetrachloride ( TiCl4 ) with calcium . Eight years later he refined this process with magnesium and even sodium in what became known as the Kroll process . Although research continues into more efficient and cheaper processes ( e.g. , FFC Cambridge , Armstrong ) , the Kroll process is still used for commercial production . 
 Titanium of very high purity was made in small quantities when Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer discovered the iodide , or crystal bar , process in 1925 , by reacting with iodine and decomposing the formed vapors over a hot filament to pure metal . 
 In the 1950s and 1960s the Soviet Union pioneered the use of titanium in military and submarine applications ( Alfa class and Mike class ) as part of programs related to the Cold War . Starting in the early 1950s , titanium came into use extensively in military aviation , particularly in high @-@ performance jets , starting with aircraft such as the F100 Super Sabre and Lockheed A @-@ 12 and SR @-@ 71 . 
 Recognizing the strategic importance of titanium the U.S. Department of Defense supported early efforts of commercialization . 
 Throughout the period of the Cold War , titanium was considered a strategic material by the U.S. government , and a large stockpile of titanium sponge was maintained by the Defense National Stockpile Center , which was finally depleted in the 2000s . According to 2006 data , the world 's largest producer , Russian @-@ based <unk> @-@ <unk> , was estimated to account for about 29 % of the world market share . As of 2015 , titanium sponge metal was produced in six countries : China , Japan , Russia , Kazakhstan , the USA , Ukraine and India . ( in order of output ) . 
 In 2006 , the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) awarded $ 5 @.@ 7 million to a two @-@ company consortium to develop a new process for making titanium metal powder . Under heat and pressure , the powder can be used to create strong , lightweight items ranging from armor plating to components for the aerospace , transport , and chemical processing industries . 
 = = Production and fabrication = = 
 The processing of titanium metal occurs in 4 major steps : reduction of titanium ore into " sponge " , a porous form ; melting of sponge , or sponge plus a master alloy to form an ingot ; primary fabrication , where an ingot is converted into general mill products such as billet , bar , plate , sheet , strip , and tube ; and secondary fabrication of finished shapes from mill products . 
 Because it cannot be readily produced by reduction of its dioxide , titanium metal is obtained by reduction of TiCl4 with magnesium metal in the Kroll Process . The complexity of this batch production in the Kroll process explains the relatively high market value of titanium , despite the Kroll process is less expensive than the Hunter process . To produce the TiCl4 required by the Kroll process , the dioxide is subjected to carbothermic reduction in the presence of chlorine . In this process , the chlorine gas is passed over a red @-@ hot mixture of rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon . After extensive purification by fractional distillation , the TiCl4 is reduced with 800 ° C molten magnesium in an argon atmosphere . Titanium metal can be further purified by the van Arkel – de Boer process , which involves thermal decomposition of titanium tetraiodide . 
 A more recently developed batch production method , the FFC Cambridge process , consumes titanium dioxide powder ( a refined form of rutile ) as feedstock and produces titanium metal , either powder or sponge . The process involves fewer steps than the Kroll process and takes less time . If mixed oxide powders are used , the product is an alloy . 
 Common titanium alloys are made by reduction . For example , <unk> ( rutile with copper added is reduced ) , <unk> titanium ( ilmenite reduced with coke in an electric furnace ) , and <unk> ( rutile with manganese or manganese oxides ) are reduced . 
 2 <unk> + 7 Cl2 + 6 C → 2 TiCl4 + 2 FeCl3 + 6 CO ( 900 ° C ) 
 TiCl4 + 2 Mg → 2 MgCl2 + Ti ( 1100 ° C ) 
 About 50 grades of titanium and titanium alloys are designed and currently used , although only a couple of dozen are readily available commercially . The ASTM International recognizes 31 Grades of titanium metal and alloys , of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure ( unalloyed ) . Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of oxygen content , with Grade 1 being the most ductile ( lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0 @.@ 18 % ) , and Grade 4 the least ductile ( highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0 @.@ 40 % ) . The remaining grades are alloys , each designed for specific properties of ductility , strength , hardness , electrical resistivity , creep resistance , specific corrosion resistance , and combinations thereof . 
 In addition to the ASTM specifications , titanium alloys are also produced to meet Aerospace and Military specifications ( SAE @-@ AMS , MIL @-@ T ) , ISO standards , and country @-@ specific specifications , as well as proprietary end @-@ user specifications for aerospace , military , medical , and industrial applications . 
 Titanium powder is manufactured using a flow production process known as the Armstrong process that is similar to the batch production Hunter process . A stream of titanium tetrachloride gas is added to a stream of molten sodium metal ; the products ( sodium chloride salt and titanium particles ) is filtered from the extra sodium . Titanium is then separated from the salt by water washing . Both sodium and chlorine are recycled to produce and process more titanium tetrachloride . 
 All welding of titanium must be done in an inert atmosphere of argon or helium to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases ( oxygen , nitrogen , and hydrogen ) . Contamination causes a variety of conditions , such as embrittlement , which reduces the integrity of the assembly welds and leads to joint failure . 
 Commercially pure flat product ( sheet , plate ) can be formed readily , but processing must take into account the fact that the metal has a " memory " and tends to spring back . This is especially true of certain high @-@ strength alloys . Titanium cannot be soldered without first pre @-@ plating it in a metal that is <unk> . The metal can be machined with the same equipment and the same processes as stainless steel . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Titanium is used in steel as an alloying element ( ferro @-@ titanium ) to reduce grain size and as a <unk> , and in stainless steel to reduce carbon content . Titanium is often alloyed with aluminium ( to refine grain size ) , vanadium , copper ( to harden ) , iron , manganese , molybdenum , and other metals . Titanium mill products ( sheet , plate , bar , wire , forgings , castings ) find application in industrial , aerospace , recreational , and emerging markets . Powdered titanium is used in pyrotechnics as a source of bright @-@ burning particles . 
 = = = Pigments , additives and coatings = = = 
 About 95 % of all titanium ore is destined for refinement into titanium dioxide ( TiO 
 2 ) , an intensely white permanent pigment used in paints , paper , toothpaste , and plastics . It is also used in cement , in gemstones , as an optical opacifier in paper , and a strengthening agent in graphite composite fishing rods and golf clubs . 
 TiO 
 2 powder is chemically inert , resists fading in sunlight , and is very opaque : it imparts a pure and brilliant white color to the brown or gray chemicals that form the majority of household plastics . In nature , this compound is found in the minerals anatase , brookite , and rutile . Paint made with titanium dioxide does well in severe temperatures and marine environments . Pure titanium dioxide has a very high index of refraction and an optical dispersion higher than diamond . In addition to being a very important pigment , titanium dioxide is also used in sunscreens .

 Because of their high tensile strength to density ratio , high corrosion resistance , fatigue resistance , high crack resistance , and ability to withstand moderately high temperatures without creeping , titanium alloys are used in aircraft , armor plating , naval ships , spacecraft , and missiles . For these applications , titanium is alloyed with aluminium , zirconium , nickel , vanadium , and other elements to manufacture a variety of components including critical structural parts , fire walls , landing gear , exhaust ducts ( helicopters ) , and hydraulic systems . In fact , about two thirds of all titanium metal produced is used in aircraft engines and frames . The SR @-@ 71 " Blackbird " was one of the first aircraft frames where titanium was used , paving the way for much wider use in modern military and commercial aircraft . An estimated 59 metric tons ( 130 @,@ 000 pounds ) are used in the Boeing 777 , 45 in the Boeing 747 , 18 in the Boeing 737 , 32 in the Airbus A340 , 18 in the Airbus A330 , and 12 in the Airbus A320 . The Airbus A380 may use 77 metric tons , including about 11 tons in the engines . In engine applications , titanium is used for rotors , compressor blades , hydraulic system components , and nacelles . The titanium 6AL @-@ 4V alloy accounts for almost 50 % of all alloys used in aircraft applications . 
 Because it is highly resistant to corrosion by sea water , titanium is used to make propeller shafts , rigging , and heat exchangers in desalination plants ; heater @-@ <unk> for salt water aquariums , fishing line and leader , and divers ' knives . Titanium is used in the housings and components of ocean @-@ deployed surveillance and monitoring devices for science and the military . The former Soviet Union developed techniques for making submarines with hulls of titanium alloys forging titanium in huge vacuum tubes . 
 = = = Industrial = = = 
 <unk> titanium pipe and process equipment ( heat exchangers , tanks , process vessels , valves ) are used in the chemical and petrochemical industries primarily for corrosion resistance . Specific alloys are used in downhole and nickel hydrometallurgy for their high strength ( e. g . : titanium Beta C alloy ) , corrosion resistance , or both . The pulp and paper industry uses titanium in process equipment exposed to corrosive media , such as sodium hypochlorite or wet chlorine gas ( in the <unk> ) . Other applications include : ultrasonic welding , wave soldering , and sputtering targets . 
 Titanium tetrachloride ( TiCl4 ) , a colorless liquid , is important as an intermediate in the process of making TiO2 and is also used to produce the Ziegler – Natta catalyst . Titanium tetrachloride is also used to <unk> glass and , because it fumes strongly in moist air , it is used to make smoke screens .

 Titanium metal is used in automotive applications , particularly in automobile and motorcycle racing where low weight and high strength and rigidity are critical . The metal is generally too expensive for the general consumer market , though some late model Corvettes have been manufactured with titanium exhausts , and the new Corvette <unk> 's <unk> supercharged engine uses lightweight , solid titanium intake valves for greater strength and resistance to heat . 
 Titanium is used in many sporting goods : tennis rackets , golf clubs , lacrosse stick shafts ; cricket , hockey , lacrosse , football helmet grills , and bicycle frames and components . Although not a mainstream material for bicycle production , titanium bikes have been used by racing teams and adventure cyclists . 
 Titanium alloys are used in spectacle frames that are rather expensive but highly durable , long lasting , light weight , and cause no skin allergies . Many backpackers use titanium equipment , including cookware , eating utensils , lanterns , and tent stakes . Though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives , titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength . Titanium horseshoes are preferred to steel by farriers because it is lighter and more durable . 
 Titanium has occasionally been used in architecture . The 40 m ( 131 foot ) memorial to Yuri Gagarin , the first man to travel in space , ( 55 ° 42 ′ 29 @.@ 7 ″ N 37 ° 34 ′ 57 @.@ 2 ″ E ) , as well as the 110 m ( 360 @.@ 9 feet ) Monument to the Conquerors of Space on top of the Cosmonaut Museum in Moscow are made of titanium for the metal 's attractive color and association with rocketry . The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and the Cerritos Millennium Library were the first buildings in Europe and North America , respectively , to be sheathed in titanium panels . Titanium sheathing was used in the Frederic C. Hamilton Building in Denver , Colorado . 
 Because of its superior strength and light weight relative to other metals ( steel , stainless steel , and aluminium ) , and because of recent advances in metalworking techniques , titanium has become more widespread in the manufacture of firearms . Primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders . For the same reasons , it is used in the body of laptop computers ( for example , in Apple 's PowerBook line ) . 
 Some upmarket lightweight and corrosion @-@ resistant tools , such as shovels and flashlights , are made of titanium or titanium alloys . 
 = = = Jewelry = = = 
 Because of its durability , titanium has become more popular for designer jewelry ( particularly , titanium rings ) . Its inertness makes it a good choice for those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools . Titanium is also alloyed with gold to produce an alloy that can be marketed as 24 @-@ carat gold because the 1 % of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark . The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14 @-@ carat gold and is more durable than pure 24 @-@ carat gold . 
 Titanium 's durability , light weight , dent and corrosion resistance makes it useful for watch cases . Some artists work with titanium to produce sculptures , decorative objects and furniture . 
 Titanium may be anodized to vary the thickness of the surface oxide layer , causing optical interference fringes and a variety of bright colors . With this coloration and chemical inertness , titanium is a popular metal for body piercing . 
 Titanium has a minor use in dedicated non @-@ circulating coins and medals . In 1999 , Gibraltar released world 's first titanium coin for the millennium celebration . The Gold Coast Titans , an Australian rugby league team , award a medal of pure titanium to their player of the year . 
 = = = Medical = = = 
 Titanium <unk> : Because it is biocompatible ( non @-@ toxic and not rejected by the body ) , titanium has many medical uses , including surgical implements and implants , such as hip balls and sockets ( joint replacement ) and dental implants that can stay in place for up to 20 years . The titanium is often alloyed with about 4 % aluminium or 6 % Al and 4 % vanadium . 
 Titanium has the inherent ability to osseointegrate , enabling use in dental implants that can last for over 30 years . This property is also useful for orthopedic implant applications . These benefit from titanium 's lower modulus of elasticity ( Young 's modulus ) to more closely match that of the bone that such devices are intended to repair . As a result , skeletal loads are more evenly shared between bone and implant , leading to a lower incidence of bone degradation due to stress shielding and <unk> bone fractures , which occur at the boundaries of orthopedic implants . However , titanium alloys ' stiffness is still more than twice that of bone , so adjacent bone bears a greatly reduced load and may deteriorate .
