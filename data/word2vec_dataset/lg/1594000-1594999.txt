 Limited to two terms as governor , Hatfield announced his candidacy in the 1966 U.S. Senate election for the seat vacated by the retiring Maurine Neuberger . During the Vietnam War , and during an election year , he was the only person to vote against a resolution by a governors ' conference that expressed support for the U.S. involvement in the war in 1966 . At that time the war was supported by 75 percent of the public , and was also supported by Hatfield 's opponent in the November election . He won the primary election with 178 @,@ 782 votes compared to a combined 56 @,@ 760 votes for three opponents . Hatfield then defeated Democratic Congressman Robert Duncan in the election . In order to finish his term as governor , which ended on January 9 , 1967 , he delayed taking his oath of office in the Senate until January 10 instead of the usual January 3 . 
 Hatfield 's re @-@ election victory for governor in 1962 and successful Senate campaign in 1966 made him something of a national figure . In 1968 , Hatfield was on Richard Nixon 's short list for vice president , and received the strong backing of his friend , the Rev. Billy Graham . Hatfield was considered too liberal by many conservatives and Southern moderates , and Nixon chose the more centrist Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew . Hatfield would later find himself at odds with Nixon over Vietnam and other issues , including a threat by Hatfield to reduce funding for the White House 's legal department in 1973 during the Watergate Scandal , after Nixon had failed to use funds appropriated for renovating dams on the Columbia River . 
 As a senator Hatfield took positions that made him hard to classify politically . In the Summer of 1969 , he had told Murray Rothbard that he had " committed himself to the cause of libertarianism . " Rothbard remarked concerning Hatfield , " obviously his voting record is not particularly libertarian — it 's very good on foreign policy and the draft , but it 's not too great on other things " , adding that " in the abstract , at least , he is very favorable to libertarianism . " Hatfield was pro @-@ life on the issues of abortion and the death penalty , though as governor he chose not to commute the sentence of a convicted murderer and allowed that execution to go forward . As a prominent evangelical Christian , he opposed government @-@ sponsored school prayer and supported civil rights for minorities . 
 In 1970 , with Senator George McGovern ( D @-@ South Dakota ) , he co @-@ sponsored the McGovern @-@ Hatfield Amendment , which called for a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam . In 1973 he explained to the Eugene Register @-@ Guard his " Neighborhood Government Act " which he repeatedly introduced in congress . It would have permitted Americans to divert their personal federal tax money from Washington to their local community . He explained that his long @-@ term goal was to have all social services provided at the neighborhood level . 
 In 1981 , Hatfield served as the chairman of the Congressional Joint Committee on Presidential <unk> , overseeing the first inauguration of Ronald Reagan in January of that year . 
 In the 1980s , Hatfield co @-@ sponsored nuclear freeze legislation with Senator Edward M. Kennedy , as well as co @-@ authoring a book on the topic . He also advocated for the closure of the N @-@ Reactor at the Hanford Nuclear Site in the 1980s , though he was a supporter of nuclear fusion programs . The N @-@ Reactor was used for producing weapons grade plutonium while producing electricity . 
 Hatfield frequently broke with his party on issues of national defense and foreign policy , such as military spending and the ban on travel to Cuba , while often siding with them on environmental and conservation issues . Senator Hatfield supported increased logging on federal lands . He was the lone Republican to vote against the 1981 fiscal year 's appropriations bill for the Department of Defense . He was rated as the sixth most respected senator in a 1987 survey by fellow senators . In 1990 , Hatfield voted against authorizing military action against Iraq in the Gulf War , one of only two members of his party to do so in the Senate . 
 Sometimes referred to as " Saint Mark " , Hatfield enjoyed warm relations with members of both Republican and Democratic parties . In 1984 , columnist Jack Anderson revealed that Mrs. Hatfield , a realtor , had been paid $ 50 @,@ 000 in fees by Greek arms dealer Basil <unk> . <unk> had been lobbying Senator Hatfield , then Appropriations Chairman , for funding for a $ 6 billion trans @-@ African pipeline . The Hatfields apologized and donated the money to a Portland hospital . In 1991 , it was revealed that Hatfield had failed to report a number of expensive gifts from the president of the University of South Carolina , James B. Holderman . Again , he apologized . The Senate 's Ethics Committee rebuked Hatfield for the latter , but cleared him of any wrongdoing for the 1984 incident . Hatfield received a rebuke from the Senate after the Ethics Committee investigated two gifts that he had received in the form of forgiven loans from a former congressman and a California businessman . 
 His final re @-@ election campaign came in 1990 against businessman Harry Lonsdale . Lonsdale aggressively went after Hatfield with television attack ads that attacked Hatfield as out of touch on issues such as abortion and timber management and accused the incumbent of being too closely allied with special interest groups in Washington . Lonsdale 's tactics moved him even with , and then ahead of Hatfield in some polls . Hatfield , who had typically stayed above the fray of campaigning , was forced to respond in kind with attack ads of his own . He raised $ 1 million in a single month after trailing Lonsdale in the polls before the November election . He defeated the Democrat with 590 @,@ 095 ( 53 @.@ 7 percent ) votes to 507 @,@ 743 ( 46 @.@ 2 percent ) votes . 
 In 1993 , he became the longest @-@ serving senator from Oregon , surpassing the record of 9 @,@ 726 days in office previously held by Charles McNary . In 1995 , Hatfield was the only Republican in the Senate to vote against the proposed balanced budget amendment , and was the deciding vote that prevented the passage of the bill . In 1996 the National Historical Publications and Records Commission , a group he served on previously , granted him their Distinguished Service Award . 
 Senator Hatfield retired in 1996 after more than 46 years of political service , having won all eleven political campaigns he entered . During his tenure he gained billions of dollars in the form of federal appropriations for projects in Oregon . This included funding for transportation projects , environmental protection of wilderness areas and scenic rivers , research facilities , and health care facilities .

 After retiring from political office , he returned to Oregon and teaching , joining the faculty of George Fox University in Newberg , Oregon . As of 2006 , he was the Herbert Hoover Emeritus Distinguished Professor of Politics at the school . Additionally , he taught at the Hatfield School of Government at Portland State University , which is named in his honor , and lectured at Willamette University and Lewis & Clark College while living in Portland . 
 In July 1999 , Hatfield and his wife were passengers on a tour bus when a car collided with the bus . He and his wife received minor injuries , but began advocating for buses to be required to have seat belts . 
 The Mark O. Hatfield Library at Willamette is dedicated to him , along with Oregon State University 's Hatfield Marine Science Center . Other namesakes include the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Maryland ; Hatfield Research Center at Oregon Health & Science University ( OHSU ) ; the Mark O. Hatfield Wilderness , Mark O. Hatfield Institute for International Understanding at Southwestern Oregon Community College ; Hatfield Government Center station at the western terminus of the MAX Blue Line light rail ; Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse in Portland ; the Mark Hatfield trailhead at the western end of the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail in the Columbia River Gorge ; and the Mark Hatfield Award for clinical research in Alzheimer 's disease . Work is underway to start a Mark O. Hatfield Memorial Trail in the Columbia River Gorge , a 60 @-@ mile trail through much of the Mark O. Hatfield Wilderness area . 
 From February 2000 to May 2008 Hatfield served on the board of directors for Oregon Health & Science University . His papers and book collection are stored in the Willamette University Archives and Special Collections , inside the Mark O. Hatfield Library . Senator Hatfield merited his own chapter in Tom Brokaw 's The Greatest Generation . 
 In 2010 , a group of filmmakers began production on a documentary film about Hatfield 's public service . 
 Hatfield was admitted to the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research hospital at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland in November 2010 for observation after his health began to decline . Mark Hatfield died at a care facility in Portland on August 7 , 2011 , after several years of illness . A specific cause of death was not immediately given .

 Andrei Pavlovich Kirilenko ( Russian : Андре ́ й Па ́ <unk> <unk> ́ <unk> ; IPA : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; 8 September [ O.S. 26 August ] 1906 – 12 May 1990 ) was a Soviet statesman from the start to the end of the Cold War . In 1906 , Kirilenko was born at <unk> in Belgorod Oblast to a Ukrainian working @-@ class family . He graduated in the 1920s from a local vocational school , and again in the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1930s from the Rybinsk Aviation Technology Institute . He became a member of the All @-@ Union Communist Party ( bolsheviks ) in 1930 . As many like him , Kirilenko climbed up the Soviet hierarchy through the " industrial ladder " ; by the 1960s , he was Vice @-@ Chairman of the Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( RSFSR ) . After Nikita Khrushchev 's forced resignation , Kirilenko became Leonid Brezhnev 's " chief lieutenant " within the Central Committee . 
 His main objective was to ensure Brezhnev 's power base and , if possible , to strengthen Brezhnev 's position within the Party . He was the first organisational secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) from Khrushchev 's ouster to the death of Leonid Brezhnev . Kirilenko was responsible for personnel selection and detailed supervision of the economic planning of the CPSU during most of the Brezhnev Era . In 1976 , Brezhnev appointed Konstantin Chernenko to be his " counterweight " in the Central Committee ( CC ) . He became a member of the Political Bureau ( Politburo ) in 1965 . He was forced to resign from active politics due to health reasons and because Yuri Andropov was appointed to the General Secretaryship . When Andropov became General Secretary in 1982 , Kirilenko was pushed aside . He died on 12 May 1990 in Moscow . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Andrei Kirilenko was born on 8 September 1906 in the village of <unk> , Belgorod Oblast , in the Russian Empire , to a working @-@ class family . As a young boy , he worked as an electrician and a locksmith . In 1920 , Kirilenko graduated from one of the local schools ; five years later , he graduated from the <unk> vocational technical school . In the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1920s , Kirilenko started working for a mining enterprise located in the Voronezh Oblast . He became an active member of Komsomol in 1929 and , two years later , became a member of the All @-@ Union Communist Party . In 1936 , he graduated from the Rybinsk Aviation Technology Institute . He started working as a design engineer for the aircraft factory , Zaporizhia Engine Plant . In 1938 , Kirilenko became an active participant in party politics and was eventually selected to the position of Second Secretary of the Voroshilov District Party Committee in <unk> Oblast . The following year , he was voted in as First Secretary . Later that year he was appointed to Second Secretary of the <unk> Regional Party Committee of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic . In this role , Kirilenko made significant contributions to the development of metallurgical and electrical engineering , but also other sorts of industry . 
 During the Great Patriotic War , Kirilenko was directly involved with evacuating industry to safe zones . From 1941 to 1943 , he was a member of the Military Soviet of the 18th Army of the Southern Front . He contributed by improving discipline among soldiers as well as improving the materiel support for the troops . In 1943 , Kirilenko was relocated to Moscow , and during his stay there the production of advanced aircraft increased rapidly . By the end of the war , in 1944 , Kirilenko was made First Secretary of the <unk> Regional Party . He succeeded Leonid Brezhnev , future Soviet leader , as First Secretary of the Dnepropetrovsk Regional Party Committee . From 1955 to 1962 , he was First Secretary of the Sverdlovsk Regional Party Committee ; he was appointed by Nikita Khrushchev himself to take charge of economic planning and personnel selection in urban areas of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( RSFSR ) . Kirilenko was later promoted to Khrushchev 's Vice @-@ Chairman of the Bureau of the Central Committee . Brezhnev benefited from Kirilenko 's position , Brezhnev used him to win over supporters of his conspiracy against Khrushchev . 
 = = Brezhnev era = = 
 = = = Rise to prominence = = = 
 Immediately after Khrushchev 's ouster , a " collective leadership " had been formed with Brezhnev as First Secretary , Alexei Kosygin as head of government and Anastas Mikoyan ( replaced in 1965 by Nikolai Podgorny ) as head of state . Central Committee Secretaries Mikhail Suslov and Kirilenko were also a part of the collective leadership . In 1962 , Kirilenko became a voting member of the Political Bureau ( Politburo ) . In 1966 , the Bureau of the Central Committee of the RSFSR was abolished , and Kirilenko became Brezhnev 's chief lieutenant . Vadim Medvedev , a Soviet official , said Kirilenko 's chief concern was maintaining and strengthening Brezhnev 's position within the Party . Men who were loyal to Brezhnev were also loyal to Kirilenko . 
 Konstantin Chernenko , another old Brezhnev protégé , became a " counterweight " to Kirilenko 's power within the Central Committee ( CC ) . Before Chernenko 's rise in the Soviet hierarchy , Kirilenko provided detailed supervision of new party personnel and the economy . When Chernenko came on board in 1976 , Kirilenko supervised the economy . By the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1970s , Kirilenko 's health was beginning to decline , and his memory weakened . Despite his failing health , he was still a high @-@ standing member , and he usually presided over the meetings of the Secretariat when Suslov was not around . First World representatives treated Kirilenko as Second Secretary of the Communist Party because most of his duties as organisational secretary had been associated with that office in the past . He was never Second Secretary , though Suslov was . During most of his term , Kirilenko was one of four who had both a seat in the Secretariat and Politburo ; the three others were Brezhnev , Suslov and Fyodor Kulakov . 
 By 1976 Kirilenko 's position within the Soviet leadership had grown to such an extent that leading officials , such as Brezhnev and Suslov , were beginning to worry about his " organisational tail " in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( RSFSR ) . His supervisory responsibilities led many of his colleagues to view him as a threat to the Party Organisational Work Department of the Central Committee – the Central Committee department overseeing the civilian economy and the military @-@ industrial complex . His position was weakened drastically by the end of the year , his weakened position did not lead to a strengthening of the Collective leadership but to the weakening of it . 
 = = = Later career and resignation = = = 
 As with Kosygin , Kirilenko 's leading position in the Soviet leadership was in " limbo " due to his support for economic reform to countenance the country 's stagnating economy . Kirilenko grew increasingly estranged with Brezhnev in 1977 , some believe that it was due to the growing economic hardship that faced the Soviet Union . It is said that the two argued over resource allocation and on how to modernise the ailing economy . However , the most common explanation is that Kirilenko grew estranged was because of his weakened position within the Collective leadership . 
 Kirilenko led the Soviet delegation to the December 1977 MPLA Party Congress . At this congress , MPLA officially subscribed to the doctrine of Marxist @-@ Leninism . This congress was important to the Soviet Union , and Kirilenko compared Angola 's development with that of Vietnam . Kirilenko , along with Premier Kosygin , had been one of the most vocal opponents to a Soviet intervention in Afghanistan . He blamed the Afghan Party leadership for the rebellion against them , claiming that the Soviets " gave them everything . " He also disliked it when the Afghan leadership tried to justify their murderous actions on the grounds that Vladimir Lenin also did it . 
 Kirilenko was seen as a possible candidate for the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1977 , however , First World observers tended to <unk> the significance of the office , and because of it , their observation were completely off the mark . Vasili Kuznetsov , a 76 @-@ year @-@ old man , was chosen to the office of First Deputy Chairman instead . During Brezhnev 's later rule , KGB chairman Yuri Andropov gradually took over the functions and , eventually , Kirilenko 's position within the Soviet leadership . In 1979 , Kirilenko lost his unofficial office as supervisor of the defence industry over to Pavel <unk> , a <unk> of Dmitriy Ustinov . Kirilenko was seen as a key candidate by the West to replace Brezhnev as Soviet leader in 1982 . After Brezhnev 's death , Kirilenko was removed from the ruling Politburo by the new General Secretary Andropov . With his deteriorating health , having a disease known as arteriosclerosis , Kirilenko was disabled from ensuing active politics or protecting himself from Andropov 's attacks . After Brezhnev 's death and funeral , Kirilenko 's mental condition deteriorated to where he could not remember the names of several leading Politburo members . He was unable to write properly during his later life ; when asked by Andropov to write a letter of resignation in 1982 , he was unable to do so . The decision to remove Kirilenko was taken before Andropov rose to power , so in the event Brezhnev had died later , Kirilenko would still have been forced to resign . The reason for the decision was that Kirilenko 's son had tried to defect to the United Kingdom . 
 = = Later life , death and recognition = = 
 When compared to other Soviet politicians who shared the same fate , Kirilenko 's downfall was , according to historian R. Judson Mitchell , a " relatively easy " fall from power . At Brezhnev 's lying @-@ in @-@ state and subsequent funeral , he was allowed to stand next besides Brezhnev 's family even if he wasn 't a member of the Soviet leadership at the time . Kirilenko made his last public appearance in 1983 , and was given an honorary retirement the same year . Mitchell believes that Andropov gave Kirilenko the honorary retirement so that he could win over Kirilenko 's " organisational tail " , literally Kirilenko 's appointees to top @-@ ranking offices during his years in service . He lived the rest of his life in Moscow and died on 12 May 1990 . He was buried at the <unk> Cemetery . During his lifetime , he was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labour twice , and he received six Orders of Lenin and one Order of the October Revolution . 
 = Cockroach = 
 Cockroaches are insects of the order Blattodea , which also includes termites . About 30 cockroach species out of 4 @,@ 600 are associated with human habitats . About four species are well known as pests . 
 The cockroaches are an ancient group , dating back at least as far as the Carboniferous period , some 320 million years ago . Those early ancestors however lacked the internal ovipositors of modern roaches . Cockroaches are somewhat generalized insects without special adaptations like the sucking mouthparts of Hemiptera ; they have chewing mouthparts and are likely among the most primitive of living <unk> insects . They are common and hardy insects , and can tolerate a wide range of environments from Arctic cold to tropical heat . Tropical cockroaches are often much bigger than temperate species , and , contrary to popular belief , extinct cockroach relatives and ' roachoids ' such as the Carboniferous <unk> and the Permian <unk> were not as large as the biggest modern species . 
 Some species , such as the gregarious German cockroach , have an elaborate social structure involving common shelter , social dependence , information transfer and kin recognition . Cockroaches have appeared in human culture since classical antiquity . They are popularly depicted as dirty pests , though the great majority of species are inoffensive and live in a wide range of habitats around the world . 
 = = Taxonomy and evolution = = 
 Cockroaches are members of the order Blattodea , which includes the termites , a group of insects once thought to be separate from cockroaches . Currently , 4 @,@ 600 species and over 460 genera are described worldwide . The name " cockroach " comes from the Spanish word for cockroach , <unk> , transformed by 1620s English folk etymology into " cock " and " roach " . The scientific name derives from the Latin <unk> , " an insect that shuns the light " , which in classical Latin was applied not only to cockroaches , but also to mantids . 
 Historically , the name <unk> was used largely interchangeably with the name Blattodea , but whilst the former name was used to refer to ' true ' cockroaches exclusively , the latter also includes the termites . The current catalogue of world cockroach species uses the name Blattodea for the group . Another name , Blattoptera , is also sometimes used . The earliest cockroach @-@ like fossils ( " <unk> " or " <unk> " ) are from the Carboniferous period 320 million years ago , as are fossil <unk> nymphs . 
 Since the 19th century , scientists believed that cockroaches were an ancient group of insects that had a Devonian origin , according to one hypothesis . Fossil roachoids that lived during that time differ from modern cockroaches in having long external ovipositors and are the ancestors of mantises , as well as modern <unk> . As the body , hind wings and mouthparts are not preserved in fossils frequently , the relationship of these roachoids and modern cockroaches remains disputed . The first fossils of modern cockroaches with internal ovipositors appeared in the early Cretaceous . A recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that cockroaches originated at least in the Jurassic . 
 The evolutionary relationships of the Blattodea ( cockroaches and termites ) shown in the cladogram are based on <unk> , <unk> & Inward ( 2007 ) . The cockroach families <unk> and <unk> are not shown but are placed within the superfamily <unk> . The cockroach families <unk> and <unk> were previously known as the <unk> and <unk> . 
 Termites were previously regarded as a separate order Isoptera to cockroaches . However , recent genetic evidence strongly suggests that they evolved directly from ' true ' cockroaches , and many authors now place them as an " epifamily " of Blattodea . This evidence supported a hypothesis suggested in 1934 that termites are closely related to the wood @-@ eating cockroaches ( genus Cryptocercus ) . This hypothesis was originally based on similarity of the symbiotic gut flagellates in termites regarded as living fossils and wood @-@ eating cockroaches . Additional evidence emerged when F. A. McKittrick ( 1965 ) noted similar morphological characteristics between some termites and cockroach nymphs . The similarities among these cockroaches and termites have led some scientists to reclassify termites as a single family , the Termitidae , within the order Blattodea . Other scientists have taken a more conservative approach , proposing to retain the termites as the Termitoidae , an epifamily within the order . Such measure preserves the classification of termites at family level and below . 
 = = Description = = 
 Most species of cockroach are about the size of a thumbnail , but several species are bigger . The world 's heaviest cockroach is the Australian giant burrowing cockroach <unk> rhinoceros , which can reach 9 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) in length and weigh more than 30 g ( 1 @.@ 1 oz ) . Comparable in size is the Central American giant cockroach <unk> giganteus , which grows to a similar length . The longest cockroach species is <unk> longipennis , which can reach 97 mm ( 3 @.@ 8 in ) in length and 45 mm ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) across . A Central and South American species , <unk> <unk> , has the largest wingspan of up to 185 mm ( 7 @.@ 3 in ) . 
 Cockroaches are generalized insects , with few special adaptations , and may be among the most primitive living <unk> insects . They have a relatively small head and a broad , flattened body , and most species are reddish @-@ brown to dark brown . They have large compound eyes , two ocelli , and long , flexible antennae . The mouthparts are on the underside of the head and include generalized chewing mandibles , salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors . 
 The body is divided into a thorax of three segments and a ten @-@ segmented abdomen . The external surface has a tough exoskeleton which contains calcium carbonate and protects the inner organs and provides attachment to muscles . It is coated with wax to repel water . The wings are attached to the second and third thoracic segments . The tegmina , or first pair of wings , are tough and protective , lying as a shield on top of the membranous hind wings , which are used in flight . All four wings have branching longitudinal veins , and multiple cross @-@ veins . 
 The three pairs of legs are sturdy , with large coxae and five claws each . They are attached to each of the three thoracic segments . The front legs are the shortest and the hind legs the longest , providing the main propulsive power when the insect runs . The spines on the legs were earlier considered to be sensory , but observations of the insect 's gait on sand and wire meshes have demonstrated that they help in locomotion on difficult terrain . The structures have been used as inspiration for robotic legs . 
 The abdomen has ten segments , each with a pair of spiracles for respiration . Segment ten bears a pair of cerci , a pair of anal styles , the anus and the external genitalia . Males have an aedeagus through which they secrete sperm during copulation and females have spermathecae for storing sperm and an ovipositor through which the ootheca is laid . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Cockroaches are abundant throughout the world and live in a wide range of environments , especially in the tropics and subtropics . Cockroaches can withstand extremely cold temperatures , allowing them to live in the Arctic . Some species are capable of surviving temperatures of − 188 ° F ( − 122 ° C ) by manufacturing an antifreeze made out of glycerol . In North America , 50 species separated into five families are found throughout the continent . 450 species are found in Australia . Only about four widespread species are commonly regarded as pests . 
 Cockroaches occupy a wide range of habitats . Many live in leaf litter , among the stems of matted vegetation , in rotting wood , in holes in stumps , in cavities under bark , under log piles and among debris . Some live in arid regions and have developed mechanisms to survive without access to water sources . Others are aquatic , living near the surface of water bodies , including bromeliad phytotelmata , and diving to forage for food . Most of these respire by piercing the water surface with the tip of the abdomen which acts as a snorkel , but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge . Others live in the forest canopy where they may be one of the main types of invertebrate present . Here they may hide during the day in crevices , among dead leaves , in bird and insect nests or among epiphytes , emerging at night to feed . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 Cockroaches are social insects ; a large number of species are either gregarious or inclined to aggregate , and a slightly smaller number exhibit parental care . It used to be thought that cockroaches aggregated because they were reacting to environmental cues , but it is now believed that pheromones are involved in these behaviors . Some species secrete these in their feces with gut microbial symbionts being involved , while others use glands located on their mandibles . Pheromones produced by the cuticle may enable cockroaches to distinguish between different populations of cockroach by odor . The behaviors involved have only been studied in a few species , but German cockroaches leave fecal trails with an odor gradient . Other cockroaches follow such trails to discover sources of food and water , and where other cockroaches are hiding . Thus , cockroaches have emergent behavior , in which group or swarm behavior emerges from a simple set of individual interactions . 
 Daily rhythms may also be regulated by a complex set of hormonal controls of which only a small subset have been understood . In 2005 , the role of one of these proteins , pigment dispersing factor ( PDF ) , was isolated and found to be a key mediator in the circadian rhythms of the cockroach . 
 Pest species adapt readily to a variety of environments , but prefer warm conditions found within buildings . Many tropical species prefer even warmer environments . Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and run away when exposed to light . An exception to this is the Asian cockroach , which flies mostly at night but is attracted to brightly @-@ lit surfaces and pale colors . 
 = = = Collective decision @-@ making = = = 
 Gregarious cockroaches display collective decision @-@ making when choosing food sources . When a sufficient number of individuals ( a " quorum " ) exploits a food source , this signals to newcomer cockroaches that they should stay there longer rather than leave for elsewhere . Other mathematical models have been developed to explain aggregation dynamics and conspecific recognition . 
 Group @-@ based decision @-@ making is responsible for complex behaviors such as resource allocation . In a study where 50 cockroaches were placed in a dish with three shelters with a capacity for 40 insects in each , the insects arranged themselves in two shelters with 25 insects in each , leaving the third shelter empty . When the capacity of the shelters was increased to more than 50 insects per shelter , all of the cockroaches arranged themselves in one shelter . Cooperation and competition are balanced in cockroach group decision @-@ making behavior . 
 Cockroaches appear to use just two pieces of information to decide where to go , namely how dark it is and how many other cockroaches there are . A study used specially @-@ scented roach @-@ sized robots that appear to the roaches as real to demonstrate that once there are enough insects in a place to form a critical mass , the roaches accepted the collective decision on where to hide , even if this was an unusually light place . 
 = = = Social behavior = = = 
 Gregarious German cockroaches show different behavior when reared in isolation from when reared in a group . In one study , isolated cockroaches were less likely to leave their shelters and explore , spent less time eating , interacted less with conspecifics when exposed to them , and took longer to recognize receptive females . Because these changes occurred in many contexts , the authors suggested them as constituting a behavioral syndrome . These effects might have been due either to reduced metabolic and developmental rates in isolated individuals or the fact that the isolated individuals hadn 't had a training period to learn about what others were like via their antennae . 
 Individual American cockroaches appear to have consistently different " personalities " regarding how they seek shelter . In addition , group personality is not simply the sum of individual choices , but reflects conformity and collective decision @-@ making . 
 The gregarious German and American cockroaches have elaborate social structure , chemical signalling , and " social herd " characteristics . <unk> and his fellow researchers stated : 
 = = = Sounds = = = 
 Some species make a hissing noise while other cockroaches make a chirping noise . The Madagascar hissing cockroach produces its sound through the modified spiracles on the fourth abdominal segment . Several different hisses are produced , including disturbance sounds , produced by adults and larger nymphs , and aggressive , courtship and copulatory sounds produced by adult males . <unk> <unk> has a stridulatory organ between its thorax and abdomen , but the purpose of the sound produced is unclear . 
 Several Australian species practice acoustic and vibration behavior as an aspect of courtship . They have been observed producing hisses and whistles from air forced through the spiracles . Furthermore , in the presence of a potential mate , some cockroaches tap the substrate in a rhythmic , repetitive manner . Acoustic signals may be of greater prevalence amongst perching species , particularly those that live on low vegetation in Australia 's tropics . 
 = = Biology = = 
 = = = Digestive tract = = = 
 Cockroaches are generally omnivorous ; the American cockroach ( <unk> americana ) , for example , feeds on a great variety of foodstuffs including bread , fruit , leather , starch in book bindings , paper , glue , skin flakes , hair , dead insects and soiled clothing . Many species of cockroach harbor symbiotic protozoans and bacteria in their gut which are able to digest cellulose . In many species , these symbionts may be essential if the insect is to utilize cellulose , however some species secrete cellulase in their saliva , and the wood @-@ eating cockroach , <unk> <unk> , is able to survive indefinitely on a diet of crystallized cellulose while being free of micro @-@ organisms . 
 The similarity of these symbionts in the genus Cryptocercus to those in termites are such that these cockroaches have been suggested to be more closely related to termites than to other cockroaches , and current research strongly supports this hypothesis about their relationships . All species studied so far carry the obligate mutualistic endosymbiont bacterium <unk> , with the exception of <unk> <unk> , an Australian cave @-@ dwelling species without eyes , pigment or wings , which recent genetic studies indicate is a very primitive cockroach . It had previously been thought that all five families of cockroach were descended from a common ancestor that was infected with B. <unk> . It may be that N. <unk> subsequently lost its symbionts , or alternatively this hypothesis will need to be re @-@ examined . 
 = = = <unk> and breathing = = = 
 Like other insects , cockroaches breathe through a system of tubes called tracheae which are attached to openings called spiracles on all body segments . When the carbon dioxide level in the insect rises high enough , valves on the spiracles open and carbon dioxide diffuses out and oxygen diffuses in . The tracheal system branches repeatedly , the finest tracheoles bringing air directly to each cell , allowing gaseous exchange to take place . 
 While cockroaches do not have lungs as do vertebrates , and can continue to respire if their heads are removed , in some very large species , the body musculature may contract rhythmically to forcibly move air in and out of the spiracles ; this may be considered a form of breathing . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Cockroaches use pheromones to attract mates , and the males practice courtship rituals , such as posturing and stridulation . Like many insects , cockroaches mate facing away from each other with their genitalia in contact , and copulation can be prolonged . A few species are known to be parthenogenetic , reproducing without the need for males . 
 Female cockroaches are sometimes seen carrying egg cases on the end of their abdomens ; the German cockroach holds about 30 to 40 long , thin eggs in a case called an ootheca . She drops the capsule prior to hatching , though live births do occur in rare instances . The egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color . The eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air . The hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air , becoming harder and darker within about four hours . Their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led to claims of albino cockroaches . Development from eggs to adults takes three to four months . Cockroaches live up to a year , and the female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime ; in favorable conditions , she can produce 300 to 400 offspring . Other species of cockroaches , however , can produce far more eggs ; in some cases a female needs to be impregnated only once to be able to lay eggs for the rest of her life . 
 The female usually attaches the egg case to a substrate , inserts it into a suitably protective crevice , or carries it about until just before the eggs hatch . Some species , however , are ovoviviparous , keeping the eggs inside their body , with or without an egg case , until they hatch . At least one genus , <unk> , is fully viviparous . 
 Cockroaches have incomplete metamorphosis , meaning that the nymphs are generally similar to the adults , except for undeveloped wings and genitalia . Development is generally slow , and may take a few months to over a year . The adults are also long @-@ lived , and have survived for as much as four years in the laboratory . 
 = = = Hardiness = = = 
 Cockroaches are among the hardiest insects . Some species are capable of remaining active for a month without food and are able to survive on limited resources , such as the glue from the back of postage stamps . Some can go without air for 45 minutes . Japanese cockroach ( <unk> japonica ) nymphs , which hibernate in cold winters , survived twelve hours at − 5 ° C to − 8 ° C in laboratory experiments . 
 Experiments on decapitated specimens of several species of cockroach found a variety of behavioral functionality remained , including shock avoidance and escape behavior , although many insects other than cockroaches are also able to survive decapitation , and popular claims of the longevity of headless cockroaches do not appear to be based on published research . The severed head is able to survive and wave its antennae for several hours , or longer when refrigerated and given nutrients . 
 It is popularly suggested that cockroaches will " inherit the earth " if humanity destroys itself in a nuclear war . Cockroaches do indeed have a much higher radiation resistance than vertebrates , with the lethal dose perhaps six to 15 times that for humans . However , they are not exceptionally radiation @-@ resistant compared to other insects , such as the fruit fly . 
 The cockroach 's ability to withstand radiation better than human beings can be explained through the cell cycle . Cells are most vulnerable to the effects of radiation when they are dividing . A cockroach 's cells divide only once each time it molts , which is weekly at most in a juvenile roach . Since not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time , many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation , but lingering radioactive fallout would still be harmful .

 Because of their ease of rearing and resilience , cockroaches have been used as insect models in the laboratory , particularly in the fields of neurobiology , reproductive physiology and social behavior . 
 The cockroach is a convenient insect to study as it is large and simple to raise in a laboratory environment . This makes it suitable both for research and for school and undergraduate biology studies . It can be used in experiments on topics such as learning , sexual pheromones , spatial orientation , aggression , activity rhythms and the biological clock , and behavioral ecology .

 The Blattodea include some thirty species of cockroaches associated with humans ; these species are atypical of the thousands of species in the order . They feed on human and pet food and can leave an offensive odor . They can passively transport pathogenic microbes on their body surfaces , particularly in environments such as hospitals . Cockroaches are linked with allergic reactions in humans . One of the proteins that triggers allergic reactions is <unk> . These allergens are also linked with asthma . 
 = = = = Control = = = = 
 Many remedies have been tried in the search for control of the major pest species of cockroaches , which are resilient and fast @-@ breeding . Household chemicals like sodium bicarbonate ( baking soda ) have been suggested , without evidence for their effectiveness . Garden herbs including bay , catnip , mint , cucumber , and garlic have been proposed as repellents . Poisoned bait containing <unk> or fipronil , and boric acid powder is effective on adults . Baits with egg killers are also quite effective at reducing the cockroach population . Alternatively , insecticides containing deltamethrin or pyrethrin are very effective . In Singapore and Malaysia , taxi drivers use <unk> leaves to repel cockroaches in their vehicles . 
 Few parasites and predators are effective for biological control of cockroaches . <unk> wasps such as <unk> wasps sting nerve ganglia in the cockroach 's thorax , temporarily paralyzing the victim , allowing the wasp to deliver a second sting into the cockroach 's brain . The wasp clips the antennae with its mandibles and drinks some hemolymph before dragging the prey to a burrow , where an egg is laid on it . The wasp larva feeds on the subdued living cockroach . 
 Cockroaches can be trapped in a deep , smooth @-@ walled jar baited with food inside , placed so that cockroaches can reach the opening , for example with a ramp of card or twigs on the outside . An inch or so of water or stale beer ( by itself a cockroach attractant ) in the jar can be used to drown any insects thus captured . The method works well with the American cockroach , but less so with the German cockroach . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 While a small minority of cockroaches are associated with human habitats and viewed as repugnant by many people , a few species are of conservation concern . The Lord Howe Island wood @-@ feeding cockroach ( <unk> lata ) is listed as endangered by the New South Wales Scientific Committee , but the cockroach may be extinct on Lord Howe Island itself . The introduction of rats , the spread of Rhodes grass ( Chloris <unk> ) and fires are possible reasons for their scarcity . Two species are currently listed as endangered and critically endangered by the IUCN Red List , <unk> ornata and <unk> <unk> . Both cockroaches have a restricted distribution and are threatened by habitat loss and rising sea levels . Only 600 <unk> ornata adults and 300 nymphs are known to exist , and these are threatened by a hotel development . No action has been taken to save the two cockroach species , but protecting their natural habitats may prevent their extinction . In the former Soviet Union , cockroach populations have been declining at an alarming rate ; this may be exaggerated , or the phenomenon may be temporary or cyclic .

 Cockroaches were known and considered repellent but useful in medicines in Classical times . An insect named in Greek " <unk> " ( " <unk> " ) has been identified with the cockroach . It is mentioned by Aristotle , saying that it sheds its skin ; it is described as foul @-@ smelling in Aristophanes ' play Peace ; <unk> called it a pest of book collections , being " page @-@ eating , destructive , black @-@ bodied " in his <unk> . Virgil named the cockroach " <unk> " ( " one that avoids light " ) . Pliny the Elder recorded the use of " <unk> " in various medicines ; he describes the insect as disgusting , and as seeking out dark corners to avoid the light . Dioscorides recorded the use of the " <unk> " , ground up with oil , as a remedy for earache . 
 Lafcadio Hearn ( 1850 – 1904 ) asserted that " For tetanus cockroach tea is given . I do not know how many cockroaches go to make up the cup ; but I find that faith in this remedy is strong among many of the American population of New Orleans . A poultice of boiled cockroaches is placed over the wound . " He adds that cockroaches are eaten , fried with garlic , for indigestion . 
 Several cockroach species , such as <unk> dubia , are raised as food for insectivorous pets . A few cockroach species are raised as pets , most commonly the giant Madagascar hissing cockroach , <unk> <unk> . 
 Cockroaches have been used for space tests . A cockroach given the name Nadezhda was sent into space by Russian scientists during <unk> @-@ M test , becoming the first terrestrial animal to " give birth " in space . 
 Because of their long association with humans , cockroaches are frequently referred to in popular culture . In Western culture , cockroaches are often depicted as dirty pests . In a 1750 – 1752 journal , Peter <unk> noted that cockroaches were frequently seen and found their way to the bakeries , after the sailing ship Gothenburg ran aground and was destroyed by rocks . 
 Donald Harington 's satirical novel The Cockroaches of Stay More ( Harcourt , 1989 ) imagines a community of " <unk> " in a mythical Ozark town where the insects are named after their human counterparts . Madonna has famously quoted , " I am a survivor . I am like a cockroach , you just can 't get rid of me . " An urban legend maintains that cockroaches are immortal .

 Meerkat Manor is a British television programme produced by Oxford Scientific Films for Animal Planet International that premiered in September 2005 and ran for four series until its cancellation in August 2008 . Blending more traditional animal documentary style footage with dramatic narration , the series told the story of the Whiskers , one of more than a dozen families of meerkats in the Kalahari Desert being studied as part of the Kalahari Meerkat Project , a long @-@ term field study into the ecological causes and evolutionary consequences of the cooperative nature of meerkats . The original programme was narrated by Bill Nighy , with the narration redubbed by Mike Goldman for the Australian airings and Sean Astin for the American broadcasts . The fourth series , subtitled The Next Generation , saw Stockard Channing replacing Astin as the narrator in the American dubbing . 
 Meerkat Manor premiered in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2005 , and the first 13 @-@ episode series concluded on 24 October 2005 . With the success of the programme in the United Kingdom , Animal Planet started broadcasting it on its national channels in Australia , Canada , and the US . It has since been rebroadcast in more than 160 other countries . The fourth , and final , series aired initially in the United States from 6 June 2008 to 22 August 2008 . In August 2009 , it was reported that the programme had been cancelled . 
 Although the show faced criticism from viewers for not intervening when a meerkat was injured and faced death , as a whole , Meerkat Manor enjoyed considerable success and was Animal Planet 's top series in October 2007 , both on the cable channel and through its video @-@ on @-@ demand service . The show 's experimental format broke new ground in animal documentary filming techniques and allowed viewers a long term , intimate look into the lives of its meerkat stars , breaking the traditional wall between viewer and subject found with most documentaries . In 2007 , Meerkat Manor was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards . It has won three awards at the 2006 Omni Awards , and at the 2006 and 2007 New York Festivals Award <unk> . The first three series of the programme have been released to DVD in both Region 1 and Region 2 . In 2007 , a book entitled Meerkat Manor – The Story of Flower of the Kalahari was released in the UK , detailing the life of Flower and the Whiskers before the series ' filming began . A television film , Meerkat Manor : The Story Begins , documenting Flower 's birth and rise to matriarch of the Whiskers aired on Animal Planet on 25 May 2008 . 
 = = Production details = = 
 Meerkat Manor was created by Caroline Hawkins , executive producer and series editor at Oxford Scientific Films , and commissioned for Animal Planet International by executive producer and commissioning editor Mark Wild . Filming for a 13 @-@ episode series took seven to eight months , and was limited to the Kalahari spring and summer seasons , as meerkats are less active during winter . Series three was filmed from November 2006 through April 2007 , and Series four began filming in October 2007 . Most scenes were filmed on location at the Kuruman River Reserve , where the Kalahari Meerkat Project that the meerkats are a part of is based . However , the meerkats seen in commercials and on the show 's website were not the same animals portrayed in Meerkat Manor . Instead , tamer @-@ rescued meerkats from the Fellow Earthlings ' Wildlife Center were filmed against a green screen . 
 The show was primarily filmed using Sony <unk> @-@ 570 cameras , although special equipment was needed for some unique footage . For scenes inside the animals ' burrows , mini fibre @-@ optic infra @-@ red cameras were employed ; wide @-@ angle shots were filmed with a seven @-@ metre crane and a remote @-@ controlled camera platform . An off @-@ camera wireless microphone was also used to record many meerkat vocalizations , only partially audible to cameras ' on @-@ board systems . Most filming was done by a single cameraman and a single sound engineer ; researchers have required a minimal human presence to avoid stressing the animals . Eye @-@ level shots were difficult to achieve at times , due to the meerkats ' small size and the limited height of even the smallest tripods . 
 For tracking purposes by the researchers , the dominant female of each group is fitted with a radio collar , as are some dominant and roaming males . The meerkats – especially younger animals – are marked with dye to differentiate them . As the meerkats are habituated , they would tend to ignore the camera crew as long as their " personal space " was respected . 
 = = = National variations = = = 
 The UK and US versions of the show have the same content for most episodes ; however , the latter was sometimes edited for length to allow for more commercial breaks . Content was also sometimes altered ; mating scenes in particular were often removed from the US version . Animal Planet US occasionally changed the names of meerkats and episode titles . Two of Flower 's pups were renamed from Ren and Stumpy to Len and <unk> ; the title of the episode was also changed . De la Soul ( named for the rap group of the same name ) , one of the sisters who started the Starsky group , was renamed Whoopi in the US as a tribute to actress Whoopi Goldberg , an early fan of the series . Animal Planet US has also renamed some of Flower 's pups born in season three to honour two other famous fans of the show , Elizabeth Taylor and Denis Leary . Several episodes were renamed : the title of the final episode of the second series was changed from " The Killing Fields " to " The Quiet Fields " . During the third series , the third episode 's title was changed from " Something 's Got to Give " to " Sister Act " ( another Goldberg reference ) , while the sixth episode 's title changed from " The House of Zappa " to " Sibling Rivalry " . 
 = = Narrative = = 
 The show follows several groups of meerkats , who act communally for the benefit of the groups in which they live . These groups are typically led by a dominant female and male , who maintain almost exclusive rights to have offspring . The group followed most closely is known as the Whiskers family . This group was chosen because of its matriarch Flower , an unusually successful dominant female who led the group for five years . During series three , Flower died from a snake bite and was succeeded by her daughter Rocket Dog . 
 Animals in neighbouring groups were highlighted in each series as well . In the first series , a group called the Lazuli were shown frequently in competition with the Whiskers family , and the opening credits referred to them as the " neighbours from hell " . Although their dominant male Big Si died between series , the Lazuli appeared in the second series , mostly as a source of roving males . Another group called the Commandoes , led by a one @-@ eyed male named Hannibal , introduced themselves by attacking the Lazuli burrow , killing a pup and badly wounding the babysitting adult . The Commandoes became the new major rivals in the area , killing the pups of evicted Whiskers female Mozart and taking over some of the Whiskers ' territory . 
 The Whiskers ' new neighbours were the Zappa and the Starsky . Although smaller than the Whiskers , the Zappa attacked frequently , and when they fled after one attack , the Whiskers – in a rare occurrence – adopted an abandoned Zappa pup . The Starsky group , on the other hand , was no threat to the Whiskers . Formed by a trio of Flower 's daughters permanently evicted from the Whiskers , the small group was ravaged by illness , predators , and a lack of new pups . The constantly struggling Starsky succumbed in the penultimate episode , with the death of the last survivor , Mozart , who was killed by a jackal . Former Whiskers female Maybelline broke away from the group at the end of the third series , forming a new group called the Aztecs which became the Whiskers ' rivals in the fourth series . 
 = = = Changes in representation = = = 
 While the show portrays real events among the Kalahari <unk> , it also removes repetitive elements of the animals ' lives . Because many days are filled with behaviour related to grooming and foraging , these routines were often left out of the show in favour of more unusual events . 
 The meerkats are all named by Kalahari Meerkat volunteers ; the individual who first sees a new litter emerge from the burrow is awarded naming rights . This has produced a variety of names , frequently drawn from volunteers ' favourite books , movies , musical groups , family and friends , historical figures and geographical locations . Animal Planet sometimes renamed the meerkats for narration , arguing that researchers ' names were too limited , often relating to spices and food condiments . Because of these changes , fans of the series who seek information on the Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project website sometimes have trouble locating particular animals . The project has created a list of alterations to help viewers connect the animals on the show to their real @-@ life counterparts , and to match episodes to the monthly KMP Life History reports . The list , however , is only available to paying members of their website . 
 Two of the major Whiskers family rivals were composites , created with footage and blended stories from multiple groups . For example , the Commandoes group on the show uses some of events from the real Commandoes group , but was primarily shown with footage from the Vivian research group – including its dominant couple . Similarly , the show 's Zappa group was mostly presented using footage from a group called " The Young Ones " ( named after the British television show ) ; however , the actual story and dominant pair were from the real Zappa Group . Axel , the abandoned pup from series three , has a research number that indicates he was probably a Young Ones pup , rather than being a Zappa as the show claims .

 Meerkat Manor has been well received by viewers and critics alike . In October 2007 , it was Animal Planet 's top series , with an audience of more than four million in the United States alone . In the United States , its first episode was viewed by one million viewers , and the second and third series premieres were watched by approximately 800 @,@ 000 viewers each . The fourth series premiere did not fare as well , with fewer than 500 @,@ 000 viewers . The viewership of the on @-@ demand video offerings for Meerkat Manor grew 20 % in September 2007 , when Discovery offered each third series episode , video capsules of series one and two , top ten moments from the show , and a memorial sequence for Flower . Building on the success of Meerkat Manor 's unique format , Animal Planet commissioned two similarly formatted programmes : Orangutan Island , which focuses on a group of orphaned orangutans at the <unk> Menteng Orangutan Rescue and Rehabilitation Center , and Lemur Street , which looks at the lives of two rival gangs of ring @-@ tailed lemurs in Madagascar . 
 Some fans have criticized the show for its non @-@ interference policy with regard to the meerkats , asking why the film crew and researchers do not give anti @-@ venom to snake @-@ bitten meerkats , or euthanize those dying and suffering . US Executive Producer Mick Kaczorowski pointed out that Meerkat Manor was a show about the real lives and deaths of the meerkats . The research group has a policy against film crews interceding in natural events " because they don 't want to have an effect on the gene pool by saving a weaker meerkat [ or ] affecting the outcome of what 's natural in the Kalahari . " As the research project is monitoring " ... the breeding success and survival of individuals and ... the factors that affect reproduction and survival " interfering in the natural processes would render the research results invalid . There is one exception to this rule : researchers will euthanize meerkats that contract tuberculosis , to prevent outbreaks that would threaten both the meerkat population and nearby cattle .

 Meerkat Manor was nominated for a 2005 Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival Award in the " Animal Behaviour " category , and in 2007 for " Best Original Score " . At the 2006 Wildscreen Festival , the series was a finalist in three categories : " Animal Behaviour " , " Innovation " , and " Popular Broadcast " . The series won Gold Statues in " Natural History " and " Cinematography " , and a Silver Statue for " Writing " , at the 2006 Omni Awards . The eighth episode of series three , " Journey 's End " which depicts the death of Whiskers matriarch Flower , was awarded the 2008 Wildscreen Festival Panda Award in the " Five Award for Popular Broadcast Programme " category . Meerkat Manor was a two @-@ time Gold Medal winner in the " Nature & Wildlife " category at the New York Festivals Award Gala , in 2006 for series one , and again in 2007 for series one and two . The series was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards in 2007 : one for " Outstanding Cinematography for Nonfiction Programming " and one for " Outstanding Picture Editing for Nonfiction Programming " . In 2009 the series was awarded the Grand Award at the New York Festivals International Television Programming and Promotion Awards in the " Family Programmes " category . 
 = = = Impact on the genre = = = 
 Meerkat Manor 's innovative new methods of filming allowed the Kalahari Project scientists a chance to uncover aspects of meerkat life never before seen , including life within the burrows . The film crew was also the first to capture meerkat infanticide on film . 
 While many documentaries maintain an emotional distance from their subjects , Meerkat Manor – due to its extended length , soap opera @-@ like narration , romanticization of the animals ' lives , and close @-@ up filming techniques , provides a closer , more personal view of the meerkats . Viewers describe being emotionally involved in the animals ' lives , sometimes forgetting they are watching a documentary . The meerkats ' frequently short lives and brutal deaths become surprising and disturbing to some audiences . This experimental format was seen as expanding the boundaries of both the nature documentary genre and the nature of reality TV . 
 Like the meerkats , Manor is an odd beast . The crew is forbidden to intervene , and the producers don 't sugarcoat the animals ' less cuddly habits ( infidelity , abandonment of young , occasional cannibalism ) . But the meerkats are named and given human traits ( " courageous , " " caring , " " bully [ ing ] " ) , and their antics and tragedies take place over a sound track . Manor is both brutal and melodramatic and thus more devastating than most documentary or scripted drama .

 Oxford Scientific Films produced a feature film for Discovery Films that acts as a prequel to the Meerkat Manor series . Originally announced as Flower : Queen of the Kalahari , Meerkat Manor : The Story Begins was directed by Chris Barker and Mike Slee and narrated by Whoopi Goldberg . The film documents Flower 's early life as she grows from a young meerkat to become one of the most successful leaders of the Whiskers clan . The film was introduced at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival in the Spotlight section , and then aired in the United States on Animal Planet on 25 May 2008 as a lead @-@ in to a thirty @-@ minute Making of Meerkat Manor : the Story Begins special . It was released to Region 1 DVD in North America on 3 June 2008 , with the Making of Meerkat Manor special , and another special , The Science of Meerkat Manor , included as extras . 
 The film included re @-@ edited footage and a new musical score . The Whiskers story was simplified , with the Lazuli being the only rival group to appear in the film . Unlike with the Meerkat Manor series , the film does not actually depict any of the real Whiskers meerkats . Untrained " meerkat actors " play the role of Flower and her family , with the camera crew searching out appropriately @-@ aged meerkats , then following them until the meerkats acted in a way that was needed for the film . Flower herself was depicted by approximately eight female meerkats .

 Bradley Joseph ( born 1965 ) is an American composer , arranger , and producer of contemporary instrumental music . His compositions include works for orchestra , quartet , and solo piano , while his musical style ranges from " quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth " . 
 Active since 1983 , Joseph has performed in front of more than a half million people around the world . He played various instruments in rock bands throughout the Midwest until 1989 when Greek composer Yanni hired him for his core band after hearing a tape of his original compositions . He was a featured concert keyboardist with Yanni through six major tours , most recently in 2003 for the 60 @-@ city Ethnicity tour . He appears in the multi @-@ platinum album and concert film , Live at the Acropolis . Joseph also spent four years as musical director and lead keyboardist for Sheena Easton , including a 1995 performance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno . 
 Joseph is the founder of the Robbins Island Music label . His solo career began when he independently released Hear the Masses , featuring many of his Yanni bandmates . This debut was followed by Rapture , an instrumental album recorded with a 50 @-@ piece orchestra in which Joseph wrote and conducted all of the scores . It was released on the Narada label and reached ZMR Airwaves Top 30 . A number of subsequent recordings including Christmas Around the World and One Deep Breath also held positions on ZMR 's Top 100 radio chart , with the most recent being Paint the Sky which debuted at # 15 in April 2013 . Paint the Sky was nominated for Best Neo @-@ Classical Album in the 10th annual ZMR Music Awards . He has produced numerous CDs / DVDs and piano books . His music is included in multiple various @-@ artist compilation albums including the 2008 release of The Weather Channel Presents : Smooth Jazz II .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 Bradley Joseph was born in Bird Island , Minnesota and raised in Willmar , Minnesota , graduating from Willmar Senior High School in 1983 . He learned how to play piano from a how @-@ to piano book he found in the piano bench . One morning his father taught him how to play a boogie @-@ woogie blues tune and by nightfall he could play the entire piece . He started playing classical piano at age eight , taking lessons for a year and a half but was self @-@ taught thereafter . While in junior high , he took a concert field trip where he saw Buddy Rich perform . He recalls , " I sat in the first row and when Buddy 's sax player stood up to take his first solo something just clicked — the world closed in around me . I felt the power of music and knew that it was something special , a gift to be shared . " Joseph played piano for the jazz band and choir in high school , and trombone through high school and college . When he picked up the horn , he got a whole new perspective on music , gaining insight into all the different timbres available , which was invaluable to him when he started working with orchestras . The first band he was in was a wedding dance band which allowed him to gain experience in every different style of music from polkas to rock and roll to jazz classics . After attending Moorhead State University as a music major , he led some of his own bands around the area that toured Midwest nightclubs . He played sax and guitar in some of these earlier bands but left them to concentrate on just the piano / keyboards . Later , he started performing with guitarist Dugan McNeill , whose U2 @-@ like group was signed to Polygram . McNeill and Yanni had once played together in the technopop band Chameleon in the late 1970s and early 1980s . 
 = = = Yanni = = = 
 In 1989 , Joseph recorded his first demo tape and sent it off to Greek composer Yanni , who was looking for someone to replace keyboardist John Tesh , as Tesh was launching his own solo career . When Yanni heard Joseph 's compositions and arrangements , he was hired over the phone to join his core band , without ever meeting . 
 After moving to Los Angeles at age 23 , he composed , arranged , and performed alongside Yanni for more than six years , performing in @-@ concert with a number of notable symphony orchestras , touring throughout the U.S. and abroad as Yanni gained worldwide fame . His first show was at the Starplex in Dallas with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra filming a video project . " It was a real trial by fire for me " , said Joseph . " First show + 10 @,@ 000 people + TV cameras equals <unk> . " He told Jane Fredericksen of the St. Croix Valley Press that " It was a big jump , you don 't really realize it at the time , but there 's no in @-@ between — going from playing nightclubs to arenas . " Some of these early tours included the Reflections of Passion , Revolution in Sound , Dare to Dream , Yanni Live , The Symphony Concerts 1993 and 1994 concert tours , as well as a performance in Germany that was broadcast throughout Europe and seen by 30 to 40 million viewers . Joseph appears on the 1994 multi @-@ platinum album and video , Live at the Acropolis . He recounts , " When I reflect back over the years , one of the high points that stand out include performing at the Acropolis with Yanni . Imagine all these different cultures coming together with the challenges of language , equipment , travel , and weather problems . I still picture the police running their dogs through the dressing rooms to sniff out any bomb possibilities right before the show . People still come up to me and comment how that show has affected their lives . " 
 In the band , Joseph covered a lot of the keyboard parts that Yanni could not for lack of hands in the shows . He assisted with the task of managing the 30 or more synthesizers onstage , and helped layer with the orchestra to create a " full @-@ bodied , live @-@ effect sound " . He did have to adjust some parts that did not work well in a live situation and worked extensively on programming sounds for all keyboardists . Joseph said that " Yanni gave us musicians a great deal of freedom to expand the music as well . If you listen to the original recordings he did and what we ended up with in our live recordings , you can really hear the musician 's input . " He readily credits Yanni 's role in his professional development , and for five years of irreplaceable experiences and memories . 
 Between tours , Joseph worked extensively in recording studios on music ranging from rock and pop to rhythm and blues and orchestration with numerous artists from RCA , Epic , Warner Brothers , and Polygram Records , in addition to performing in an elaborate national keyboard show tour with various musicians . In 2003 , he returned for the 60 @-@ city Ethnicity tour . 
 = = = Sheena Easton = = = 
 Joseph also performed with Sheena Easton for four years as her co @-@ musical director and lead keyboardist . He went from Yanni to Easton and back to Yanni in a few years . " It was a great transition from Yanni because it made me musically aware again " , he said in reference to Easton 's R & B style . " I went back to where I started but it felt like a new invention . " 
 Wheeler questioned how he got hooked up with Easton ; Joseph answered that he was recommended by a former road manager . He was included in a try @-@ out with four others , rehearsed with the band , they then cut it down to two , and rehearsed with Sheena for the final cut . Joseph anticipated they would ask him to do a solo on at least one of the songs he was asked to play during the audition , so he wrote a solo for all three songs , which was ultimately the reason he was hired for the job . 
 In a 1995 interview , he said that after five years of touring with Yanni and working on his own debut album , he needed a break . Yanni was still building his career and maintained a hectic concert schedule . Working with Easton , on the other hand , was " the best of both worlds " . " She just adopted a baby and is pretty settled in " , said Joseph . Tour venues with her included Japan , Indonesia , Puerto Rico , and the United States , as well as routine appearances in Las Vegas and Atlantic City . In March 1995 , he appeared with her on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno when she performed her new single at the time , " My Cherie " . 
 = = = Solo career = = = 
 = = = = More Core Records = = = = 
 In 1994 , between world tours , Joseph released his debut album , Hear the Masses , a self @-@ produced , self @-@ published release under the More Core Records label consisting of 10 original compositions . He invited most of the Yanni band to contribute . They include Charlie Adams ( drums , percussion ) ; Ric <unk> ( fretless bass ) ; Jeanette Clinger ( vocals ) ; and Grammy @-@ winning violinist Charlie <unk> . Other guest artists include Larry Preston ( guitar ) ; and Terry Brau — featured on numerous Bradley Joseph recordings — playing trumpet , saxophone , and <unk> . 
 = = = = Narada = = = = 
 Joseph 's style attracted the attention of Narada Productions , a Virgin Records subsidiary , via the World Wide Web . A representative for Narada came across his website and downloaded some music . This sparked their interest and resulted in signing Joseph to a multi @-@ record deal , according to Peter Spellman of the Berklee College of Music . The outcome was Rapture , containing intimate piano pieces , quartets , and full orchestral works . It reached ZMR 's " Airwaves Top 30 " at No. 15 in July 1997 . This album was recorded at a number of different studios including Captain and Tennille 's studio in Los Angeles , and Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls , Minnesota . In addition to a core band including Charlie Adams on percussion , Charlie <unk> on violin , and Steven <unk> on clarinet , Joseph brought in a 50 @-@ piece orchestra , and conducted and wrote all the scores . Ken Moore of the Naples Daily News cites , " Joseph 's music is backed by 15 talented musicians , some playing three or more different instruments , that make up a symphony of sounds ranging from quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth . " Wind and Wire Magazine contributor , Michael Debbage , recalls , " It was the year 1997 and New Age music had already peaked commercially as the interest and exposure seemed to lag . The genres main labels – Narada , Windham Music , and Higher Octave – were beginning to explore worldly themes versus the warm , earthly , acoustic themes that prior artists had established . It appeared that the abundance of new artists was becoming a dying breed . An exception to the rule was Bradley Joseph , who released his first mainstream album Rapture to glorious reviews , and to this day it remains his tour de force . " One of Joseph 's compositions , " The Glen " , was written solely for the album Stories , a Narada Artist Collection , and is now also featured on 20 Years of Narada Piano . His works are included in other Narada compilation projects as well . 
 = = = = Robbins Island Music = = = = 
 Although Joseph said that working with Narada was a great experience music @-@ wise , he did not like the lack of control over the end product , and asked to be released from his contract . He started Robbins Island Music in 1998 , composing , producing , and distributing his own recordings . Solo Journey was released and consists of eleven soft piano compositions that are based on mood and not on melody . It is characterized by Debbage as being a " scaled down introspective , ... and while simplistic was still breath @-@ taking " . 
 Later releases include Christmas Around the World reaching ZMR 's Top 100 Radio Playlist ; and One Deep Breath also holding a position on ZMR 's Top 100 Radio Chart for over six months . Bill Binkelman writes that while he doubts fans of Liquid Mind or other mainly electronic new age music artists would wholly embrace the overt romanticism of piano @-@ led tracks like ' Dancers Waltz ' or ' Dreamer 's Lullaby ' , there is definite appeal on the album for fans of adult contemporary piano pieces , as well as for lovers of the more minimal approach to new age music . " Reviewing for Allmusic , Jim <unk> describes One Deep Breath as a set of smooth adult contemporary pieces in which Joseph adds " world music flair and inspirational touches " . " The vocal expressions by <unk> Whang and Joseph have devotional qualities that weave through the atmospheres and soundscapes smoothly . " 
 Joseph returned as a featured instrumentalist during Yanni 's 2003 Ethnicity world tour , and wrote his sixth album on stage after sound checks . The Journey Continues , a sequel to Solo Journey , features Joseph on solo piano . Debbage writes , " The magical world of movies has a knack for exploring sequels . There is the beauty and beast effect when taking this pathway . The creative beauty allows the viewers to see the continued growth of its characters . The beastly aspect of this exploration is the Hollywood exploitation of an almost guaranteed return on its investment with no regard for its creative progression that usually sees diminishing returns . Bradley Joseph has decided to walk this tightrope by following up with Solo Journey that was released back in 2000 . I am glad to report that The Journey Continues is entrenched in beauty , holding up well to its predecessor . " 
 Subsequent releases include For the Love of It , Piano Love Songs , and Hymns and Spiritual Songs . On these albums , Joseph arranges piano , orchestra , and soft rhythms to cover melodies such as " I 'll Never Fall in Love Again " ( Burt Bacharach ) , " Fields of Gold " ( Sting ) , and " Ave Maria " ( Schubert ) . He has produced numerous CD and DVD projects designed for pets in a Music Pets Love series . He has also produced a four @-@ CD set of Nature Sounds and has published many of his compositions in sheet music form . His music is used throughout the DVD , Isle Royale Impressions Volume II , containing video footage by Carl <unk> of scenery and wildlife from the Isle Royale National Park in Michigan . 
 In April 2013 , Joseph released his first album of original compositions in 10 years entitled Paint the Sky which debuted at # 15 on ZMR 's Top 100 Radio Chart . It is self @-@ described as " piano instrumentals with a cinematic feel " . He received requests from listeners to do another CD with original compositions that incorporate lush orchestration along with the piano , similar to Hear The Masses and Rapture . Kathy Parsons of MainlyPiano states that " Joseph is obviously a very versatile musician , and there are a lot of influences and musical styles that meld together to make Paint the Sky an exceptional musical experience . " Michael Debbage of MainlyPiano writes that Paint the Sky represents Joseph ’ s most complete recording since his landmark album Rapture . He goes on to say that " whether you have enjoyed Joseph ’ s more spatial recordings or his deeper embellished adventures , Paint the Sky essential is a musical rainbow of where Joseph has been and where he can potential go . " 
 = = = = Accolades and achievements = = = = 
 Joseph was named one of the " Ten Outstanding Young Minnesotans " ( <unk> ) of 2004 by the Minnesota Jaycees . In April 2008 he was presented the " WPS Foundation Arts and Academics Hallmarks of Pride " award for outstanding achievements by an alumnus . His music has been on Billboard charts , # 1 on Amazon.com , # 1 on ITunes , and top 40 for Sirius satellite radio . 
 Joseph 's music has been heard in regular rotation in the United States and Canada by more than 160 major radio networks including XM and Sirius satellite radio , DMX ; in the United Kingdom including RTÉ lyric fm ; as well as airwaves in Japan , Spain , China , South @-@ East Asia , Thailand , Germany , Switzerland , and Russia . Airlines such as <unk> , AirTran , Frontier , JetBlue , and ExpressJet feature his music in their in @-@ flight music programs . The Weather Channel also utilizes his compositions during the " Local on the 8s " segments , and the song " Friday 's Child " is included in their 2008 compilation release , The Weather Channel Presents : Smooth Jazz II . 
 Paint the Sky ( 2013 ) was nominated for Best Neo @-@ Classical Album in the 10th annual ZMR Music Awards . 
 = = = = Thoughts on success as an independent artist = = = = 
 Having experienced both avenues of recording on a major label and later choosing to be an independent artist , a combination of musicianship with business know @-@ how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music . He spends most of his time writing songs , composing arrangements , making recordings , and publishing and distributing his works . " I 'm my own boss . I can do what I want . I can change directions " , he told West Central Tribune 's Anne <unk> . As an independent , business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled , Joseph said . " A lot of musicians don 't learn the business . You just have to be well @-@ rounded in both areas . You have to understand publishing . You have to understand how you make money , what 's in demand , what helps you make the most out of your talent . " " I couldn 't license my music if it wasn 't mine " , he said . " It has allowed me to create CDs . It separates you from the million other great players . " 
 In an interview with author <unk> Janus , Joseph commented that his perspective has changed a great deal from when he was younger . He said , " Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician , not running a business . Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses . " But some artists just want to be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both . Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants . He advises , " ... to keep your eyes and ears open all the time . All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music , if you 're paying attention , and not closed off to anything . " He explains , " Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing my art with others as a musician while running my own music business . And that kind of success is as good as I could have ever wished for . " 
 When asked by Wheeler what brought him back to Minnesota after living in Los Angeles and traveling around the world , Joseph replied , " The first thing business people say is ' First and foremost , if you want to be successful , live where you want to live ' . " He grew up there and family were important to him . When he decided to become a solo artist he wanted to be comfortable in his environment and moved back . 
 = = Composition and musical style = = 
 = = = On composing = = = 
 In an interview with Indie Journal , Joseph said that when writing music he prefers to concentrate on the melody first , stating , " Basically , I write from a two @-@ person standpoint . First , I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement . Then I let it breathe and come back , approaching from more of an objective point of view . This allows me to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning , shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener . " This same concept is explained again in a taped interview with the Government Television Network with Joseph explaining that a lot of times he may only come up with part of a melody . Then he would let it rest and come back to it and see if it feels right . Then he would start " building around it " , like putting a car together - start with a frame and then start building things around it . Musically , he tries to connect a common bridge between such exhilarating feelings as performing at the Acropolis , to the emotions each and every one feels every day . " In the end , a good melody will always stand the test of time " , says Joseph . 
 Debbage comments , " One strength of Bradley Joseph as an artist has been his keen ability to write inspiring music with appropriately titled songs that express that thought non @-@ verbally " . Joseph explained to Janus that , " Through instrumental music , I 'm allowed to come up with musical ideas that allow the listener to create their own impression of my song . If you add lyrics about a girl in the song , the listener doesn 't have a choice of what the song is about , it 's told to them . My musical writings allow me to express anything . It 's easier for me to tell a story of something I 've encountered this way than to verbalize it . And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to what I could ever say in a few sentences . " He believes that " music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts , thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words . " He also believes that the spiritual aspect of creating is to " find something deep within yourself that can only be created by you " ... " Your spiritual self cannot be copied and that 's why it 's so significant in life and music " , he says . Parsons goes on to say , " The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph 's sound , but his musical voice is his own . " Yanni once said , " Bradley , your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift " . Joseph later realized what Yanni meant was that he needed that as a composer , that it was a crucial component " to be sensitive to what you see and to be able to apply that to music " . 
 <unk> reports that he often references the past when he names his songs and his music is frequently reminiscent of his rural Minnesota roots . " Wind Farmer " was inspired by childhood visits to a relative 's farm near Olivia , and his company , Robbins Island Music , is named after a city park in Willmar . 
 Joseph employs a variety of instruments to compose including the Korg Triton music workstation , Korg SG @-@ 1 piano , and occasionally Korg M1 . Rack units have included Roland JD @-@ 800 , and Roland JV @-@ 1080 which he says is " great for string layers " . The Alesis D4 , Yamaha <unk> , and Yamaha <unk> which has " some nice ethereal textures " have been utilized ; working also with E @-@ mu Systems Proteus 1 , Proteus 2 , and the E @-@ 5000 sampler because it is " easy to use and has a great library " . Acoustic pianos vary , Yamaha and <unk> were used for the 1997 album , Rapture . 
 = = = Musical style = = = 
 Joseph 's musical style and direction have varied over time , having released more than two hundred original compositions and arrangements since 1994 . " When I write it , it just kind of moves , because where I am in life is different " , Joseph said . " So as I get older , it kind of changes . " 
 = = = = Hear the Masses and Rapture = = = = 
 Joseph 's recordings can offer full orchestrations such as in Hear the Masses and Rapture that combine smooth jazz with contemporary instrumental themes . A review of Rapture from New Age Voice states Joseph " paints romantic pictures in sound with voices and instruments that escalate from quiet , intimate passages to big , energetic movements " . " The arrangements are structured so that the trumpet can lead a line out on ' Be Still ' signaling an introspective sort of mood ; yet the strings swell on ' The Passage ' engulfing the listener in an ocean of sound . " " Even cuts that start quiet , such as ' Healing the Hollow Man ' or ' Blue Rock Road ' ebb and flow between quiet moments and crescendos . " 
 = = = = Solo Journey and The Journey Continues = = = = 
 In contrast , albums such as Solo Journey and The Journey Continues are considered to be " stripped back and basic " by Debbage , with the latter featuring " Joseph and his piano with no additional clutter " . " There is color in the songs via their understated melodies . " As examples , Debbage describes Joseph as using a chord progression that translates into a strolling rhythm in the song " The Road Ahead " . Solo Piano Publications contributor , Kathy Parsons , writes , " ... ' The Long , Last Mile ' starts out with a bittersweet melody , and then builds in intensity and complexity with cello , winds , and ethereal sounds intertwining around the piano . Then it breaks off , and the opening melody returns . " 
 = = = = One Deep Breath = = = = 
 For the 2002 album One Deep Breath , Joseph combines " structured melodic pieces and free @-@ form ambient compositions " , which " departs dramatically from the previous more explosive and dynamic music on his first two recordings , Hear the Masses and Rapture " . Binkelman writes , " It is an album with two distinct ' feels ' to it : the more serene new age / ambient soundscapes that bookend the inner tracks and the more radio @-@ friendly and mainstream music in @-@ between . " For instance , the song " Dance of Life " was inspired by Antonín Dvořák 's opera , " Rusalka " . It is a bit more straightforward in its piano presentation , and will probably appeal the most to hardcore fans of solo instrumental music , says Instrumental Weekly . Then the album closes with its title track , " One Deep Breath " , that " floats and meanders for more than ten minutes , bringing in ocean sounds " . It is " far and away the most ambient of everything else to be found here " , and is " stunning , both in its execution and how radical a change it is from what has come before " . 
 = = = = Christmas Around the World and Classic Christmas = = = = 
 Debbage depicts " A Minnesota Snowfall " from Christmas Around the World as taking " a more naked , bare @-@ boned ballad approach " . While discussing Classic Christmas , Gerry <unk> , chairman of the University of Wisconsin – Oshkosh sociology department , states that Joseph 's usual approach is to play the carol straight , and then add his own twists . " ... he 's very effective at that — he doesn 't stray as far as a jazz or classical organ improviser might , but he does keep the interest up . " <unk> says that the same applies to Joseph 's earlier Christmas Around the World CD , which he found even more interesting because of the use of other instrumental sounds . 
 = = = = Suites & Sweets = = = = 
 Joseph has also produced numerous CDs that include cover arrangements for piano and orchestra . The 2009 release of Suites & Sweets features compositions by Beethoven , Mozart , Bach , and other classical composers . Joseph told Fredericksen that he , " took the best parts and movements out of those classical songs … and made it soft and calm all the way through . " 
 = = = = Paint the Sky = = = = 
 After requests from listeners for Joseph to do another CD with original compositions that incorporate lush orchestration along with the piano , similar to Hear The Masses and Rapture , Joseph released Paint the Sky in April 2013 . It is self @-@ described as " piano instrumentals with a cinematic feel " . John P. Olsen of New Age Music World writes that " Paint The Sky ... is best expressed by the near even number of songs with upbeat melodies and lively rhythms , with the balance centered by a light , casual relaxed atmosphere ... with importance given to melodic rhythm and phrasing . " In another review of Paint the Sky , Bill Binkelman of Wind and Wire says that " Joseph is one of the very best artists when it comes to crafting piano instrumentals augmented by the spot @-@ on application of an assortment of keyboard embellishments , from standard orchestral accompaniment to more textural / new age elements " . Kathy Parsons of MainlyPiano states " The thirteen pieces ... range from tender to majestic . Several pieces are solo piano and others are orchestrated with keyboards to give a vibrant , cinematic effect . " 
 About this album , Binkelman describes the song " Inside the Stars " as " an uptempo , joyous lead piano melody accented by bouncy rhythms played on kit drums , thumping bass , and tambourine plus superlative orchestral strings " . Michael <unk> of MainlyPiano states that " the optimism of this album is felt immediately courtesy of the buoyancy of ' Inside The Stars ' , filled with Joseph ’ s nifty piano work more in the vein of Bruce Hornsby , then layered in strings and percussion work " . 
 In an in @-@ depth analysis of the composition " In Dreams Awake " , Binkelman opines that this song bears a strong contemporary classical influence and that some people might even hear strains of Philip Glass ’ music . He says there is an exultant feel to the melody , but because Joseph maintains absolute control of nuance and shading the song never descends into overblown melodrama or bombast . As the track progresses , the mood and style shifts into a more identifiable new age motif , with more textural synths , bell tones and bell trees , and a more pronounced sweeping sensation of subdued grandeur . The Glass @-@ like motif returns for the song ’ s finale . Parsons characterizes this same song as " a concept piece that begins with an intense and intriguing theme for cello or viola and strings . Building as it evolves , it never takes a breath until near the end of the theme . From there , the piece becomes dreamy and ambient , " floating effortlessly " on keyboard sounds until the original strings re @-@ enter , increasing to the intensity of the first theme " . At the same time , Debbage notes " ... the multi @-@ movements found on the challenging ' In Dreams Awake ' ... " and says that it " ... opens with an extended piece of strings that almost appear to be battling against each other , only to move into a beautiful dreamy midsection to once again return to the more chaotic strings , much like our nonsensical dreams " . 
 <unk> goes on to say that the song " Into the Big Blue " should instantly call Aaron Copland to mind – it has the same BIG orchestral / cinematic sound to it , along with Copland @-@ esque western rhythm and melodic motifs . Similarly , Debbage states that this song brings to mind the musical opening theme of that old western television show The Big Valley . 
 In reference to the song " Secrets of the Sun " , Binkelman describes " lush strings and gorgeous new age synths with the piano melody here brimming with a blend of the ethereal and the romantic with a dash of wistfulness besides " . The synth sounds remind him a little of Ray Lynch . Parsons details this as " much calmer and more graceful with a piano melody and keyboard enhancements " . Debbage writes that " the remainder of the album is filled with Joseph ’ s uncanny ability to compose elegant and emotive ballads . Back track to ' Secrets Of The Sun ' that gently sways in the piano and string arrangements with similar results found on ' The Edge Of My Heart ' . 
 = = = Genres and radio formats = = = 
 Generally , Joseph 's music gets airplay in the adult contemporary , smooth jazz , easy listening , and beautiful music radio formats , and while some is classified in the new age genre , he considers contemporary instrumental to fit his style of playing the best . In discussing Rapture , John Blake of The Atlanta Journal notes that often new age music sounds as if it should be played in a supermarket . The songs can sound like musical cotton candy — soft , airy and ultimately uninteresting . " For the most part , Bradley 's music doesn 't make that mistake . " " The music is cinematic , filled with introspective piano solos , swelling violins , and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream . " Along the same line , Michael Debbage of Mainly Piano says that Rapture almost single @-@ handedly gave a sense of hope that there was much more that the New Age genre could offer . <unk> Janus remarks that , " Although Bradley has been , at times , pigeon holed into an offshoot of jazz , his message through his music is universal in its appeal and soothing qualities . "

 = Cherish ( Madonna song ) = 
 " Cherish " is a song by American singer Madonna from her fourth studio album Like a Prayer ( 1989 ) . It was written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard , and was released by Sire Records as the album 's third single on August 1 , 1989 . " Cherish " was built around the themes of love and relationship , with William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet being one of the major inspirations . The track also included a line from " Cherish " by the 1960s band The Association . Musically constructed as a doo @-@ wop style pop song , it is regarded as a light @-@ hearted track by critics and includes instruments such as drum machine , percussions , keyboards and a saxophone . Lyrically , it speaks of Madonna 's devotion to her lover , and her promise to be always by his side . " Cherish " was included on Madonna 's greatest hits compilations The Immaculate Collection ( 1990 ) and the two @-@ disc edition of Celebration ( 2009 ) . 
 After its release , the song received positive feedback from reviewers , who were surprised by the change of content and the lighter image of Madonna 's music , unlike her previous singles from Like a Prayer which incorporated themes such as religion and sexuality . They compared the lyrics of the song to words spoken by Juliet , in William Shakespeare 's play , Romeo and Juliet . " Cherish " was a commercial success , reaching the top @-@ ten of the charts in Australia , Belgium , Canada , Ireland , Italy , United Kingdom and the combined European chart . On the Billboard Hot 100 , " Cherish " became Madonna 's 16th consecutive top @-@ five single , setting a record in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 chart . 
 A black @-@ and @-@ white music video of the song was directed by photographer Herb Ritts at the Paradise Cove Beach in Malibu , California . In the video , Madonna plays herself , while three co @-@ actors dressed as Mermen swam in and out of the sea . Academics noted that the Mermen became symbols for the homosexual community and the oppression it faced . Madonna performed " Cherish " on her Blond Ambition World Tour ( 1990 ) , where the performance included her dancers dressed up as Mermen . Its symbolism was seen to de @-@ <unk> men , relegating them to objects of desire . 
 = = Background = = 
 " Cherish " was written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard , and released as the third single from Like a Prayer ( 1989 ) . The song is built around the themes of love and relationships , with William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet one of its major inspirations . Madonna was reading Romeo and Juliet during the breaks during rehearsals for Speed the Plow , a Broadway show in which she was starring in 1988 . On the third day of the Like a Prayer recording sessions , she presented Leonard with the lyrics of " Cherish " , and explained that she had written the song " one sunny afternoon by the beach " , but later confessed that it was actually written in her make @-@ up room . Leonard introduced one line from the similar titled song by the 1960s band The Association , " Cherish is the word I use " , after which Madonna decided to include it on Like a Prayer . The B @-@ side of the single release of " Cherish " was a previously unreleased track called " Supernatural " , composed during the recording sessions of her third studio album , True Blue ( 1986 ) . In 2009 , during an interview with Rolling Stone , Madonna confessed that she had never been able to predict if her songs would be successful , irrespective of her personal opinion of them . As an example , she cited " Cherish " as one of the most " retarded " songs she had written , but noted it became a commercial success . The song was also included on the 1990 compilation album The Immaculate Collection and the two @-@ disc edition of her 2009 compilation Celebration . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Cherish " is a doo @-@ wop style pop shuffle song and opened the second side of Like a Prayer . It begins with the sound of synths and keyboard and Madonna repeatedly singing the words " cherish , cherish " . This is followed by the sound from drum machine , as percussion and guitars accompany her voice . During the bridge , Madonna sings the line " Cupid please take your aim at me " , as the keyboard sound becomes pronounced . The drum changes its rhythm and Madonna moves into the chorus , " Cherish the joy , of always having you here by my side " , accompanied by background vocals and a bass guitar . The second verse continues in the same way , with Madonna singing the line " Romeo and Juliet , they never felt this way I bet , So don 't underestimate my point of view . " 
 As the second chorus ends , a saxophone starts playing as Madonna softly asks the listener , " Who ? You ! Can 't get away , won 't let you " , followed by Leonard 's The Association inspired line . Background vocals continue repeating words over a horn , playing in B ♭ minor . The drums and the percussion start again and the chorus is sung twice , before fading out . According to the sheet music published by Alfred Publishing Co . Inc . , " Cherish " is composed in the time signature of common time , with a moderately fast tempo of 130 beats per minute . Set in the key of D major , " Cherish " has Madonna singing between the tonal nodes of A3 to D5 . The song follows the sequence of G / D – D – Em7 – D in the beginning as its chord progression , which changes to D – Dm – C – Em7 during the verses and shifts to G – D / G – A – D / F ♯ in the chorus . 
 The lyrics of " Cherish " makes it a simple love song , where Madonna talks about devotion and having her lover by her side , whom she would never leave . According to semiotician Thomas <unk> , the backbone of " Cherish " is constructed by incorporating titles of previous romantic pop hits . Songs such as " Cupid " ( Sam Cooke ) , " You Are My Destiny " ( Paul Anka ) and " I Can 't Let Go " ( The Hollies ) are used within the first verse , while other verses use the words of such song titles as " Burning Love " ( Elvis Presley ) and " Two Hearts " ( Bruce Springsteen ) . Other instances include The Association song reference and Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet . Richard Burt , author of Shakespeare After Mass Media , deduced that the lines on Romeo and Juliet and " I Can 't Let Go " makes the speaker alternate between assertiveness and dependency . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt that although " Cherish " was a " radiant " song invoking the pop music of the 60s , " in the grand pop scheme , [ it ] pales only in comparison to their glorious counterparts , making Like a Prayer one of the quintessential pop albums of all time . "

 Wayne Robins from Newsday believed that the song exemplified the " kind of random pop we 'd get if [ postmodern author ] William Burroughs were the program director of a Top 40 radio station . " Burt compared the song and Madonna 's delivery of the lyrics with the dialogues spoken by Shakespeare 's Juliet , and found similarity in the , " Sweet so would I , Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing " from the play , with the lyrics of " Cherish " . Allen Metz , one of the authors of The Madonna Companion , felt that " Cherish " as the opening song of the B @-@ side of Like a Prayer , reaffirmed the sweet and happy romanticism that was missing from the A @-@ side of the album . " As much a child of pop " he says , " as of the church , Madonna is restored by music 's healing power , in this case with a mixture of classic sweet soul and L.A. pop moderne . " Lucy O 'Brien , author of Madonna : Like an Icon , felt that the song was typical of Madonna 's previous musical endeavors , and would have been more suitable for her third studio album , True Blue , whose songs mainly dealt with romance and relationships . Music critic J. D. Considine , while reviewing the Like a Prayer album for Rolling Stone complimented the song for creating an effective balance , contrasting its lighthearted nature with the trauma of " Oh Father " , the next song . Considine also found retro @-@ rock references in the song . 
 Freya Jarman @-@ Ivens , one of the authors of Madonna 's Drowned Worlds , felt that the song was one of the last works on pure romanticism by Madonna . " She should come back to the formula from time to time , but I guess she has moved beyond all of that " , Jarman @-@ Ivens added . Carol Clerk , author of Madonnastyle noted that the " refreshing " nature of the song was particularly noticeable if one follows Madonna 's catalog chronologically , especially embedded between the anthem like nature of the previous release , " Express Yourself " , and the lament of the succeeding release , " Oh Father " . Scholar Maria Raha wrote in her book Cinderella 's Big Score : Women of the Punk and Indie Underground that the song was full of " trite " lyrics . Andy Goldberg from The Jerusalem Post said that " Cherish " took " Madonna back to her old stomping grounds , the lively bass line and lilting melodies of hit albums past . " Kevin Phinney from Austin American @-@ Statesman was surprised by Madonna 's contribution to the song and confessed that he " [ found ] it difficult to be believe that she even wrote this ? " Phinney continued that he wanted Madonna to go in a more mature direction and compose songs musically similar to " Cherish " . Writing for The Washington Post , Richard Harrington explained that " while songs on Like a Prayer dealt with matters opening her heart , with ' Cherish ' Madonna dealt with matters which were close to her heart . " This view was also shared by Ian Blair from Chicago Tribune who categorized the song as being sung for the " happy @-@ go @-@ lucky lovers and dreamers " . The Dallas Morning News ' Lennox Samuels appreciated the light @-@ hearted theme of the song and complimented Madonna and Leonard for not sticking with personal subject matters only on the album . Dale Anderson from The Buffalo News opined that the song would become one of Madonna 's most forgettable releases , but was also hopeful that it would not . This opinion was shared by Don McCleese of Chicago Sun @-@ Times , who added that " Cherish " was not something expected from Madonna at that point of time . McCleese was disappointed that Madonna went back to the " happy @-@ go @-@ lucky , lovey @-@ dovey " kind of songs , which did not match her self @-@ image . Dan DeLuca from The Philadelphia Inquirer , while reviewing Madonna 's Drowned World Tour in 2001 , compared " Cherish " with songs by Chris Robinson , humorously adding that " only if he was gay he would sing something like that . "

 In the United States , " Cherish " debuted at number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart . The next week it moved to number 28 on the chart , becoming the week 's " greatest gainer " song . After three weeks , as " Cherish " entered the top @-@ five of Billboard Hot 100 , music industry prognosticators theorized that the song would become Madonna 's eighth number @-@ one song on the Hot 100 . However , the song started facing competition from fellow singer Janet Jackson 's single " Miss You Much " , which also moved into the top @-@ ten the same week . The popular media pitted the two women against each other and tried to create rivalry between them . The song eventually peaked at number two on October 7 , 1989 , the same week " Miss You Much " topped the Hot 100 . " Cherish " became Madonna 's sixteenth consecutive top @-@ five single , a record in Hot 100 chart history . It was present on the Hot 100 for a total of 15 weeks . Unlike previous Madonna singles , " Cherish " was not a dance hit and did not make an appearance on the Hot Dance Music / Club Play chart , but was able to top the Hot Adult Contemporary chart , her third after " Live to Tell " and " La Isla Bonita " . " Cherish " also helped Madonna to win the " Top Adult Contemporary Artist " trophy at the 1989 Billboard Music Awards . On the year @-@ end charts of Billboard , " Cherish " ranked at number 59 on the Hot 100 and number 31 on the Adult Contemporary chart . In Canada , " Cherish " debuted at number 80 on the RPM Singles Chart on August 14 , 1989 . In its ninth week on the chart , the song reached number one , staying there for two weeks . The song was present on the chart for 17 weeks and was the ninth best @-@ selling Canadian single for 1989 . 
 On September 1 , 1989 , " Cherish " was released in the United Kingdom and entered the UK Singles Chart at number 16 . The next week , the song moved to its peak position of number three , becoming Madonna 's 21st top ten single in the United Kingdom . According to the Official Charts Company , the song has sold 200 @,@ 000 copies there . " Cherish " entered the Australian Singles Chart at number 17 on September 17 , 1989 , and reached a peak of number four , staying on the chart for 16 weeks . In the Netherlands , " Cherish " debuted at number 24 on the Dutch Top 40 chart , and reached a peak of number 15 , the next week . 
 = = Music video = = 
 " Cherish " was accompanied by a black @-@ and @-@ white music video that was directed by Herb Ritts and was filmed on July 22 , 1989 at Paradise Cove Beach in Malibu , California . Its world @-@ premiere took place on MTV on August 28 , 1989 . Ritts was one of Madonna 's preferred photographers at that time and so she asked him to direct the " Cherish " video . Ritts reportedly tried to talk her out of it saying , " But I 'm a still photographer . I don 't know anything about film . " Undaunted , Madonna replied simply , " Well you have a few weeks to learn . " The video was conceptualized by Ritts , who wanted to portray Mermen in their natural habitat , but Madonna baulked at the idea since she wanted to be portrayed as herself , but keep the Mermen also . Four male performers were signed for this , one of them being Tony Ward , who would become Madonna 's boyfriend later , with the other three being water polo players from nearby Pepperdine University . There were four Merman tails created by Global Effects in North Hollywood , California , for the video . Three full size tails for the mermen were cast in a solid highly flexible rubber , each weighing around 40 lbs . This was necessary to make them neutrally buoyant in water as lighter tails would have floated , causing the swimmers to be head down in the sea . Once in these tails , the polo players needed to be carried to and from the water and once inside , they had tremendous swimming power and agility . This was partly due to a plastic spring like armature cast into the flipper of each tail . One of the reasons that this video was shot in black and white was because the water was very cold , causing Madonna 's already pale complexion to look even whiter . 
 Fouz deduced a relationship between the music and the images in the video for " Cherish " , saying that they complement each other ; the author felt that this in turn encouraged the viewer to watch the video repeatedly . Fouz talked about the balancing of height and depth occurring in the video . The visual depictions of the Mermen and the lighting used in the video was influenced by Ritts ' still photography known as " The Male Nude Bubble " , which showed nude male models inside a giant water tank , with a white cloth entwined around them . Many of the qualities in the photos , including the floating nature of the models , were used in the swimming and the posing of the Mermen . Carol Vernallis , author of Experiencing Music Video , found homoerotic connotations between Madonna and the Mermen . The Mermen in the video exist in a self @-@ contained world of their own , where they procreate with their own kind , both biologically and socially . The fact that the Mermen did not seem to possess genitalia led Vernallis to believe that it associated them with Ritts ' other works , homoerotic sculptural images without penis . Their tails drew different meanings , including sexual ones and Christian symbolism . Since in contemporary art , the images of Mermen are rare and Mermaids are prominent , they are sometimes called fairies partly because it is not known how they came to be . Vernallis believed that the mysteriousness and the elusiveness of the mermen in the video played a crucial role . They never address the camera directly and are often shown disappearing from view . Vernallis believed that since invisibility is a central theme in the homosexual community , this actually portrayed oppression and also the desire to watch but never be seen . 
 = = Live performance and covers = = 
 Madonna has performed " Cherish " live only during one tour , on her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour . Onstage , the performance mirrored the sequence from the music video , with the appearance of three of Madonna 's dancers , dressed as mermen . Author Carol Clerk noted in her book Madonnastyle that the outfit worn by the singer during this sequence was the simplest and the softest costume of the show . It consisted of a black mini @-@ dress trimmed and stitched with a stuffed West African stork , called the marabou . Madonna gyrated around her dancers , while playing with a harp . During the chorus , the dancers lifted their prosthetic fish @-@ tails and joined them with each other . Guilbert felt that the performance de @-@ <unk> men , since they are relegated to objects of adoration , like the three mermen dancers . This view was shared by Mark Bego , author of Madonna : Blonde Ambition , who said that " Madonna and her girls go into a very girlish mode , but they give the feeling that they are in charge , be it playing with the mermen , or teasing them . " Two different performances were taped and released on video , the Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90 , taped in Yokohama , Japan , on April 27 , 1990 , and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live , taped in Nice , France , on August 5 , 1990 . 
 The late Brazilian singer Renato Russo included an acoustic cover of the song on his 1994 album The Stonewall Celebration Concert . His version was appreciated by Alvaro <unk> of Allmusic . The 2000 compilation album Virgin Voices : A Tribute To Madonna , Vol . 2 contains a cover by worldbeat group Loop Guru . An alternative rock cover of the song by The Prayers was included on the 2007 Madonna tribute compilation Through the Wilderness .

 = Agkistrodon piscivorus = 
 Agkistrodon piscivorus is a venomous snake , a species of pit viper , found in the southeastern United States . Adults are large and capable of delivering a painful and potentially fatal bite . When antagonized , they will stand their ground by coiling their bodies and displaying their fangs . Although their aggression has been exaggerated , individuals may bite when feeling threatened or being handled . This is the world 's only semiaquatic viper , usually found in or near water , particularly in slow @-@ moving and shallow lakes , streams , and marshes . The snake is a strong swimmer and will even enter the sea . It has successfully colonized islands off both the Atlantic and Gulf coasts . 
 The generic name is derived from the Greek words <unk> ( hooked ) and odon ( tooth ) , and the specific name comes from the Latin piscis ( fish ) and <unk> ( to eat ) ; thus , the scientific name translates into “ hooked @-@ tooth fish @-@ eater ” . Common names include variants on water moccasin , swamp moccasin , black moccasin , cottonmouth , <unk> , or simply viper . Many of the common names refer to the threat display , where this species will often stand its ground and gape at an intruder , exposing the white lining of its mouth . Three subspecies are currently recognized , including the nominate subspecies described here . 
 = = Description = = 
 This is the largest species of the genus Agkistrodon . Adults commonly exceed 80 cm ( 31 in ) in length , females grow up to be smaller than males . Total length , per one study of adults , was 65 to 90 cm ( 26 to 35 in ) . Average body mass has been found to be 292 @.@ 5 to 579 @.@ 6 g ( 10 @.@ 32 to 20 @.@ 44 oz ) in males and 201 @.@ 1 to 254 @.@ 1 g ( 7 @.@ 09 to 8 @.@ 96 oz ) in females . Occasionally , individuals may exceed 180 cm ( 71 in ) in length , especially in the eastern part of the range . According to <unk> and Conant ( 1990 ) , the largest recorded specimen of A. p. piscivorus was 188 cm ( 74 in ) in length , based on a specimen caught in the Dismal Swamp region and given to the Philadelphia Zoological Garden . It should be noted , however , that this snake had apparently been injured during capture , died several days later and was measured when straight and relaxed . Large specimens can be extremely bulky , with the mass of a specimen of approximately 180 cm ( 71 in ) in length known to attain 4 @.@ 6 kg ( 10 lb ) . 
 The broad head is distinct from the neck , and the snout is blunt in profile with the rim of the top of the head extending forwards slightly further than the mouth . Substantial cranial plates are present , although the parietal plates are often fragmented , especially towards the rear . A loreal scale is absent . There are six to 9 supralabials and eight to 12 infralabials . At midbody , there are 23 – 27 rows of dorsal scales . All dorsal scale rows have keels , although those on the lowermost scale rows are weak . In males / females , the ventral scales number 130 @-@ 145 / 128 @-@ 144 and the subcaudals 38 @-@ 54 / 36 @-@ 50 . Many of the latter may be divided . 
 Though the majority of specimens are almost or even totally black , ( with the exception of head and facial markings ) , the color pattern may consist of a brown , gray , tan , yellowish @-@ olive or blackish ground color , which is overlaid with a series of 10 – 17 dark brown to almost black crossbands . These crossbands , which usually have black edges , are sometimes broken along the dorsal midline to form a series of staggered <unk> on either side of the body . These crossbands are visibly lighter in the center , almost matching the ground color , often contain irregular dark markings , and extend well down onto the ventral scales . The dorsal banding pattern fades with age , so older individuals are an almost uniform olive @-@ brown , grayish @-@ brown or black . The belly is white , yellowish @-@ white or tan , marked with dark spots , and becomes darker posteriorly . The amount of dark pigment on the belly varies from virtually nothing to almost completely black . The head is a more or less uniform brown color , especially in A. p. piscivorus . Subadult specimens may exhibit the same kind of dark , parietal spots characteristic of A. contortrix , but sometimes these are still visible in adults . Eastern populations have a broad , dark , postocular stripe , bordered with pale pigment above and below , that is faint or absent in western populations . The underside of the head is generally whitish , cream or tan . 
 Juvenile and subadult specimens generally have a more contrasting color pattern , with dark crossbands on a lighter ground color . The ground color is then tan , brown or reddish brown . The tip of the tail is usually yellowish , becoming greenish yellow or greenish in subadults , and then black in adults . On some juveniles , the banding pattern can also be seen on the tail . Young snakes wiggle the tip of their tail to lure prey animals . 
 This species is often confused with the copperhead , A. contortrix . This is especially true for juveniles , but there are differences . A. piscivorus has broad , dark stripes on the sides of its head that extend back from the eye , whereas A. contortrix has only a thin dark line that divides the pale supralabials from the somewhat darker color of the head . The watersnakes of the genus Nerodia are also similar in appearance , being thick @-@ bodied with large heads , but they have round pupils , no loreal pit , a single anal plate , subcaudal scales that are divided throughout and a distinctive overall color pattern .

 = = Geographic range = = 
 This species is found in the eastern US from the Dismal Swamp in southeast Virginia , south through the Florida peninsula and west to Arkansas , eastern and southern Oklahoma , and western and southern Georgia ( excluding Lake Lanier and Lake <unk> ) . A few records exist of the species being found along the Rio Grande in Texas , but these are thought to represent disjunct populations , now possibly eradicated . The type locality given is " Carolina " , although Schmidt ( 1953 ) proposed this be restricted to the area around Charleston , South Carolina . 
 Campbell and Lamar ( 2004 ) mentioned this species as being found in Alabama , Arkansas , Florida , Georgia , Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Louisiana , Mississippi , Missouri , North Carolina , Oklahoma , South Carolina , Texas , and Virginia . Maps provided by Campbell and Lamar ( 2004 ) and Wright and Wright ( 1957 ) also indicate its presence in Western and Middle Tennessee and extreme southeastern Kansas , and limit it to the western part of Kentucky . 
 In Georgia , it is found in the southern half of the state up to a few kilometers north of the fall line with few exceptions . Its range also includes the Ohio River Valley as far north as southern Illinois , and it inhabits many barrier islands off the coasts of the states where it is found . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 This species is classified as Least Concern ( LC ) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species ( <unk> , 2007 ) . Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution , presumed large population , or because they are unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category . When last assessed in 2007 , the population trend was stable . 
 Constant persecution of the species and drainage of wetland habitat prior to development has taken a heavy toll on local populations . Despite this , it remains a common species in many areas . 
 In Indiana , the cottonmouth is listed as an endangered species . 
 = = Habitat = = 
 This is the most aquatic species of the genus Agkistrodon , and is usually associated with bodies of water , such as creeks , streams , marshes , swamps and the shores of ponds and lakes . The U.S. Navy ( 1991 ) describes it as inhabiting swamps , shallow lakes and sluggish streams , but it is usually not found in swift , deep , cool water . Behler and King ( 1979 ) list its habitats as including lowland swamps , lakes , rivers , <unk> , sloughs , irrigation ditches , canals , rice fields and small , clear , rocky , mountain streams . 
 It is also found in brackish water habitats and is sometimes seen swimming in saltwater . It has been much more successful at colonizing Atlantic and Gulf coast barrier islands than the copperhead , A. contortrix . However , even on these islands , it tends to favor freshwater marshes . A study by <unk> and Freda ( 1985 ) describes it as not being particularly salt @-@ tolerant . 
 The snake is not limited to aquatic habitats , however , as <unk> and Conant ( 1990 ) mentioned large specimens have been found more than a mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from water . In various locations , the species is well @-@ adapted to less moist environments , such as palmetto thickets , pine @-@ palmetto forest , pine woods in East Texas , pine flatwoods in Florida , eastern deciduous dune forest , dune and beach areas , riparian forest and prairies . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 The aggressiveness of these snakes has been greatly exaggerated . In tests designed to measure the various behavioral responses by wild specimens to encounters with people , 23 of 45 ( 51 % ) tried to escape , while 28 of 36 ( 78 % ) resorted to threat displays and other defensive tactics . Only when they were picked up with a mechanical hand were they likely to bite . 
 When sufficiently stressed or threatened , this species engages in a characteristic threat display that includes vibrating its tail and throwing its head back with its mouth open to display the startling white interior , often making a loud hiss while the neck and front part of the body are pulled into an S @-@ shaped position . Many of its common names , including " cottonmouth " and " <unk> " , refer to this behavior , while its habit of snapping its jaws shut when anything touches its mouth has earned it the name " trap @-@ jaw " in some areas . Other defensive responses can include flattening the body and emitting a strong , pungent secretion from the anal glands located at the base of the tail . This musk may be ejected in thin jets if the snake is sufficiently agitated or restrained . The smell has been likened to that of a billy goat , as well as to a genus of common flood plain weeds , <unk> , that also have a penetrating odor . 
 Harmless watersnakes of the genus Nerodia are often mistaken for it . These are also semiaquatic , thick @-@ bodied snakes with large heads that can be aggressive when provoked , but they behave differently . For example , watersnakes usually flee quickly into the water , while A. piscivorus often stands its ground with its threat display . In addition , watersnakes do not vibrate their tails when excited . A. piscivorus usually holds its head at an angle of about 45 ° when swimming or crawling . 
 Brown ( 1973 ) considered their heavy muscular bodies to be a striking characteristic , stating this made it difficult to hold them for venom extraction owing to their strength . 
 This species may be active during the day , as well as at night . However , on bright , sunny days , they are usually found coiled or stretched out somewhere in the shade . In the morning and on cool days , they can often be seen basking in the sunlight . They often emerge at sunset to warm themselves on warm ground ( i.e. , sidewalks , roads ) and then become very active throughout the night , when they are usually found swimming or crawling . Contrary to popular belief , they are capable of biting while underwater . 
 In the north , they hibernate during the winter months . <unk> ( 1947 , 1948 ) made observations in Georgia and noted they were one of the last species to seek shelter , often being found active until the first heavy frosts . At this point , they moved to higher ground and could be found in rotting pine stumps by tearing away the bark . These snakes could be quite active upon discovery and would then attempt to burrow more deeply into the soft wood or escape to the nearest water . In southeastern Virginia , Wood ( 1954 ) reported seeing migratory behavior in late October and early November . During a period of three or four days , as many as 50 individuals could be seen swimming across Back Bay from the bayside swamps of the barrier islands to the mainland . He suggested this might have something to do with hibernating habits . In the southern parts of its range , hibernation may be short or omitted altogether . 
 = = Feeding = = 
 Raymond Ditmars ( 1912 ) described this species as " <unk> " . Its diet includes mammals , birds , amphibians , fish , snakes , small turtles and small alligators . Cannibalism has also been reported . Normally , though , the bulk of its diet consists of fish and frogs . On occasion , juvenile specimens feed on invertebrates . Catfish are often eaten , although the sharp spines sometimes cause injuries . Toads of the genus Bufo are apparently avoided . 
 Many authors have described the prey items taken under natural circumstances . Although fish and frogs are their most common prey , they will eat almost any small vertebrate . Campbell and Lamar ( 2004 ) provided an exhaustive list of species that have reportedly been preyed upon by A. piscivorus , including cicadas , caterpillars , land snails ( <unk> rosea ) , catfish ( Ictalurus <unk> ) , pike ( Esox ssp . ) , sunfishes ( Lepomis ssp . ) , bass ( <unk> ssp . ) , sirens ( Siren spp . ) , eastern newts ( Notophthalmus viridescens ) , brook salamanders ( <unk> spp . ) , Ouachita dusky salamanders ( Desmognathus <unk> ) , spadefoot toads ( Scaphiopus ) , eastern <unk> toads ( <unk> carolinensis ) , northern cricket frogs ( Acris <unk> ) , West Indian <unk> ( Osteopilus septentrionalis ) , <unk> ( Hyla spp . ) , true frogs ( Rana spp . ) , green <unk> ( Anolis carolinensis ) , skinks ( <unk> spp . ) , eastern glass lizards ( <unk> ventralis ) , ground skinks ( <unk> lateralis ) , <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , hog @-@ nosed snakes ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> ( Lampropeltis spp . ) , watersnakes ( Nerodia spp . ) , crayfish snakes ( Regina spp . ) , brown snakes ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> and <unk> ( Thamnophis spp . ) , other <unk> ( A. piscivorus ) , rattlesnakes ( Crotalus spp . ) , common snapping turtles ( Chelydra serpentina ) , mud turtles ( <unk> spp . ) , common musk turtles ( <unk> odoratus ) , Florida <unk> ( Pseudemys floridana ) , sliders ( Trachemys scripta ) , eastern box turtles ( <unk> <unk> ) , Florida <unk> turtles ( <unk> ferox ) , baby American alligators ( Alligator mississippiensis ) , wood thrushes ( Hylocichla mustelina ) , chickadees ( Parus spp . ) , cardinals ( Cardinalis cardinalis ) , unidentified passerines , small ducks , juvenile <unk> ( Anhinga anhinga ) , common egrets ( Ardea alba ) , egrets , glossy ibises and their eggs ( Plegadis falcinellus ) , tricolor herons ( Egretta tricolor ) , herons and their eggs , pied @-@ billed grebes ( <unk> <unk> ) , short @-@ tailed shrews ( Blarina brevicauda ) , least shrews ( <unk> parva ) , southeastern shrews ( Sorex longirostris ) , eastern moles ( Scalopus aquaticus ) , muskrats ( Ondatra zibethicus ) , rice rats ( Oryzomys palustris ) , hispid pocket mice ( <unk> hispidus ) , black rats ( Rattus rattus ) , squirrels ( Sciurus spp . ) , rabbits ( Sylvilagus spp . ) and bats . 
 Fish are captured by cornering them in shallow water , usually against the bank or under logs . They take advantage when bodies of water begin to dry up in the summer or early fall and gorge themselves on the resulting high concentrations of fish and tadpoles . A study by <unk> ( 1992 ) found they were surprisingly unsuccessful at seizing either live or dead fish underwater . 
 They are opportunistic feeders and will sometimes eat carrion . Campbell and Lamar ( 2004 ) described having seen them feeding on fish heads and viscera that had been thrown into the water from a dock . Heinrich and <unk> ( 1996 ) reported an occasion in which an individual was seen feeding on the butchered remains of a feral hog ( Sus scrofa ) that had been thrown into Cypress Creek . 
 Conant ( 1929 ) gave a detailed account of the feeding behavior of a captive specimen from South Carolina . When prey was introduced , the snake quickly became attentive and made an attack . Frogs and small birds were seized and held until movement stopped . Larger prey was approached in a more cautious manner ; a rapid strike was executed after which the snake would withdraw . In 2 @.@ 5 years , the snake had accepted three species of frogs , including a large bullfrog ; a spotted salamander , water snakes , garter snakes , sparrows , young rats and three species of mice . Brimley ( 1944 ) described a captive specimen that ate copperheads ( A. contortrix ) , as well as members of its own species , keeping its fangs embedded in its victims until they had been immobilized . 
 Young individuals have yellowish or greenish tail tips and engage in caudal luring . The tail tip is wriggled to lure prey , such as frogs and lizards , within striking distance . Wharton ( 1960 ) observed captive specimens exhibiting this behavior between 07 : 20 and 19 : 40 hours , which suggests it is a daytime activity . 
 = = Predators = = 
 These snakes are preyed upon by snapping turtles ( Chelydra serpentina ) , American alligators ( Alligator mississippiensis ) , horned owls ( Bubo virginianus ) , eagles , red @-@ shouldered hawks ( Buteo lineatus ) , loggerhead shrikes ( Lanius ludovicianus ) , and large wading birds , such as herons , cranes and egrets . 
 They are also preyed upon by <unk> snakes , including their own species . Humphreys ( 1881 ) described how a 34 @-@ inch ( 860 mm ) specimen was killed and eaten by a 42 @-@ inch ( 1 @,@ 100 mm ) captive kingsnake . On the other hand , Neill ( 1947 ) reported captive <unk> ( Lampropeltis <unk> ) were loath to attack them , being successfully repelled with " body blows " . Also called body @-@ bridging , this is a specific defensive behavior against <unk> snakes , first observed in certain rattlesnake ( Crotalus ) species by <unk> ( 1927 ) , that involves raising a section of the middle of the body above the ground to varying heights . This raised loop may then be held in this position for varying amounts of time , shifted in position , or moved towards the attacker . In the latter case , it is often flipped or thrown vigorously in the direction of the assailant . In A. piscivorus , the loop is raised laterally , with the belly facing towards the attacker . 
 = = Reproduction = = 
 This species is ovoviviparous , with females giving birth to one to 16 live young and possibly as many as 20 . However , litters of six to eight are the most common . <unk> are 22 – 35 cm in length ( excluding runts ) , with the largest being A. p. <unk> and A. p. <unk> the smallest . If weather conditions are favorable and food is readily available , growth is rapid and females may reproduce at less than three years of age and a total length of as little as 60 cm . The young are born in August or September , while mating may occur during any of the warmer months of the year , at least in certain parts of its range . 
 Regarding A. p. piscivorus , an early account by Stejneger ( 1895 ) described a pair in the Berlin Zoological Garden that mated on January 21 , 1873 , after which eight neonates were discovered in the cage on July 16 of that year . The young were each 26 cm in length and 1 @.@ 5 cm thick . They shed for the first time within two weeks , after which they accepted small frogs , but not fish . 
 Combat behavior between males has been reported on a number of occasions , and is very similar in form to that seen in many other <unk> species . An important factor in sexual selection , it allows for the establishment and recognition of dominance as males compete for access to sexually active females . 
 A few accounts exist that describe females defending their newly born litters . <unk> ( 1960 , 1966 ) reported several cases where females found near their young stood their ground and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior . Another case was described by Walters and Card ( 1996 ) in which a female was found at the entrance of a chamber with seven neonates crawling on or around her . When one of the young was moved a short distance from the chamber , she seemed to be agitated and faced the intruder . Eventually , all of her offspring retreated into the chamber , but the female remained at the entrance , ready to strike . 
 = = = Facultative parthenogenesis = = = 
 Parthenogenesis is a natural form of reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilization . A. piscivorus can reproduce by facultative parthenogenesis , that is , they are capable of switching from a sexual mode of reproduction to an asexual mode . The type of parthenogenesis that likely occurs is “ <unk> with terminal fusion ” , a process in which two terminal products from the same meiosis fuse to form a diploid zygote ( see Figure ) . This process leads to genome wide <unk> , expression of deleterious recessive alleles and often to developmental failure ( inbreeding depression ) . Both captive @-@ born and wild @-@ born A. piscivorus appear to be capable of this form of parthenogenesis . 
 = = Venom = = 
 A. piscivorus venom is more toxic than that of A. contortrix ( the copperhead ) and is rich with tissue @-@ destructive enzymes . It is a powerful cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue . Although deaths are rare , the bite could leave scars and , on occasion , require amputation . Absent an anaphylactic reaction in a bitten individual , however , the venom does not cause systemic reactions in victims and does not contain neurotoxic components that are present in numerous rattlesnake species . Bites can be effectively treated with <unk> antivenom ; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers ( the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes , the Mojave rattlesnake , and the cottonmouth ) . 
 Bites from the cottonmouth are relatively frequent in the lower Mississippi River Valley and along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico , although fatalities are rare . Allen and Swindell ( 1948 ) compiled a record of A. piscivorus bites in the state of Florida from newspaper accounts and data from the Bureau of Vital Statistics : 1934 , eight bites and three fatalities ( no further fatalities were recorded after this year ) ; 1935 , 10 ; 1936 , 16 ; 1937 , 7 ; 1938 , 6 ; 1939 , 5 ; 1940 , 3 ; 1941 , 6 ; 1942 , 3 ; 1943 , 1 ; 1944 , 3 , 1998 ; 1 . Wright and Wright ( 1957 ) report having encountered these snakes on countless occasions , often almost stepping on them , but never being bitten . In addition , they heard of no reports of any bites among 400 cypress cutters in the Okefenokee Swamp during the entire summer of 1921 . These accounts suggest that the species is not particularly aggressive . 
 Brown ( 1973 ) gave an average venom yield ( dried ) of 125 mg , with a range of 80 – 237 mg , along with LD50 values of 4 @.@ 0 , 2 @.@ 2 , 2 @.@ 7 , 3 @.@ 5 , 2 @.@ 0 mg / kg IV , 4 @.@ 8 , 5 @.@ 1 , 4 @.@ 0 , 5 @.@ 5 , 3 @.@ 8 , 6 @.@ 8 mg / kg IP and 25 @.@ 8 mg / kg SC for toxicity . Wolff and <unk> ( 1939 ) described a 152 cm ( 60 in ) specimen that yielded 3 @.@ 5 ml of venom during the first extraction and 4 @.@ 0 ml five weeks later ( 1 @.@ 094 grams of dried venom ) . 
 Symptoms commonly include <unk> and swelling . The pain is generally more severe than bites from the copperhead ( A. contortrix ) but less so than those from rattlesnakes ( Crotalus spp . ) . The formation of vesicles and bullae is less common than with rattlesnake bites , although necrosis can occur . <unk> is sometimes reported . On the other hand , the US Navy ( 1991 ) states the venom has strong proteolytic activity that can lead to severe tissue destruction .

 = New York State Route 273 = 
 New York State Route 273 ( NY 273 ) was a state highway in northern Washington County , New York , in the United States . It began at an intersection with U.S. Route 4 ( US 4 ) east of the village of Whitehall and ended at the Vermont state line in the town of Hampton , just east of a junction with NY 22A . The route passed through largely rural areas and entered only one community , the small hamlet of East Whitehall . 
 NY 273 followed part of the former routing of the Hampton and Whitehall Turnpike , a privately maintained highway that linked the village of Whitehall to a bridge over the Poultney River near the hamlet of Hampton , where it continued to Poultney , Vermont , in the 19th century . The portion of the turnpike west of East Whitehall became part of US 4 in 1927 ; however , US 4 was realigned in the mid @-@ 1940s to follow a new , more direct highway between Whitehall and the Vermont state line at Fair Haven , Vermont . NY 273 was assigned in 1949 to the path of old turnpike ; however , the NY 273 designation was eliminated in 1980 as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and Washington County . The former routing of NY 273 west of NY 22A became County Route 18 ( CR 18 ) . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 273 began at an intersection with US 4 east of the village of Whitehall in the town of Whitehall . After the intersection , the route passed the Our Lady of Angels Cemetery , where it turned to the southeast . NY 273 ran along the base of Ore Red Hill , outside of Whitehall . Near Ore Red Hill , the highway intersected with a local road , which connected to US 4 . The route progressed to the southeast , entering the hamlet of East Whitehall , where it intersected with another local road . 
 NY 273 passed Bartholomew Hill and entered the town of Hampton , where it passed two mountains , Morris Hill , and the larger Thorn Hill . The highway then passed north of Crystal Lake , and entered the hamlet of Hampton . NY 273 intersected NY 22A in the small community before ending at the Vermont state line on a bridge over the Poultney River . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 On April 11 , 1820 , the New York State Legislature created the Hampton and Whitehall Turnpike Road Company , a privately owned tasked with building the Hampton and Whitehall Turnpike . According to the act incorporating the company , the highway would begin at a bridge in the town of Hampton ( at the Poultney River ) and follow " the most convenient route " to the community of Whitehall Landing on Wood Creek ( the modern village of Whitehall ) in the town of Whitehall . 
 The Hampton and Whitehall Turnpike Road Company was initially financed through 800 shares of stock valued at $ 20 each . Under the text of the act establishing the entity , only one toll gate was permitted on the turnpike . The toll charged at the gate varied by person ; the exact amount was based on the vehicle used and the number of livestock and horses that were brought onto the roadway . By 1920 , the turnpike company ceased to exist and the state of New York had plans in place to improve the portion of the turnpike west of the hamlet of East Whitehall . The improved road would be part of a state highway extending from the village of Whitehall to the Vermont state line at Fair Haven , Vermont . The contract for the project was awarded on April 5 , 1921 , and the highway was completed by 1926 . 
 = = = Designations = = = 
 When the Whitehall – Fair Haven highway first opened , it did not have a designation . However , the road was part of the proposed routing of US 4 , a route in the new U.S. Highway System . It officially became part of US 4 when the system was officially approved in November of that year . In the early 1940s , construction began on a new highway between Whitehall and Fair Haven that bypassed East Whitehall to the northwest . It was completed by 1946 , at which time it became a realignment of US 4 . On January 1 , 1949 , the old Hampton and Whitehall Turnpike was designated as NY 273 , a new route connecting US 4 east of Whitehall to the Vermont state line in Hampton . 
 In 1980 , NY 273 was removed from the state highway system as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and Washington County . On April 1 , 1980 , ownership and maintenance of NY 273 was transferred from the state of New York to Washington County ; however , the NY 273 designation had officially ceased to exist one week earlier on March 24 , 1980 . Following the swap , the former routing of NY 273 was redesignated as CR 18 while the short connector to Vermont became part of CR 18A , then a loop route off NY 22A . CR 18A has since been reconfigured to follow a new highway leading directly from NY 22A to the Poultney River bridge .

 = Cyclone Kathy = 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Kathy was a powerful tropical cyclone that devastated the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands in March 1984 . Originating from a tropical low off the southern coast of Papua New Guinea . Tracking westward , the system attained gale @-@ force winds by 18 March before striking the Cape York Peninsula . After crossing the area , Kathy entered the Gulf of Carpentaria where environmental conditions favoured significant development . On 22 March , the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone ( Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale ) with ten @-@ minute sustained winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) . By this time , the storm had been tracking towards the southwest and struck the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands later on 22 March before moving over the Australian mainland as a slightly weaker system . Once over land , Kathy rapidly degraded , losing gale @-@ force winds within 24 hours ; the storm dissipated over the Northern Territory on 24 March . 
 Moving through the Pellew Islands as a powerful cyclone , Kathy generated a maximum storm surge of 4 @.@ 2 metres ( 14 ft ) and winds exceeding 232 km / h ( 144 mph ) . Offshore , 20 vessels were affected , one of which sank and resulted in the death of its captain . In mainland Australia , the system struck a relatively sparsely populated area , with only Borroloola being significantly impacted by the cyclone . Additionally , mangroves at along the McArthur River sustained substantial damage . Overall , losses from the storm were placed at A $ 12 million ( A $ 30 @.@ 5 million 2011 AUD ; US $ 24 @.@ 1 million 2011 USD ) . Following its usage , the name Kathy was retired and will never be used again to name an Australian cyclone . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On 16 March 1984 , the Bureau of Meteorology began monitoring a tropical low off the southern coast of Papua New Guinea for possible development into a tropical cyclone . Over the following day , the system quickly developed and attained gale @-@ force winds as it neared the Cape York Peninsula . Attaining a pressure of 990 hPa ( mbar ; 29 @.@ 23 inHg ) , the weak system made landfall just north of Weipa , Queensland on 19 March before losing strength . Though already considered a tropical cyclone for two days by the Bureau , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued their first advisory on the system just prior to its landfall ; however , they considered it to be a tropical depression rather than a storm . After roughly 12 hours over land , a weakened Kathy emerged over the warm waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria on 20 March . Once over water , the JTWC classified the system as a tropical storm . Turning southwestward , the storm entered a region favoring significant development and soon began a period of rapid intensification . 
 Intensification took place through 22 March as convection deepened around Kathy 's centre and a well @-@ defined eye formed . The system reached its peak strength as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale with ten @-@ minute sustained winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) . Operational analysis of the storm indicated a minimum pressure of 920 hPa ( mbar ; 27 @.@ 17 inHg ) ; however , a reassessment in 2009 concluded that Kathy 's pressure had been slightly lower , bottoming out at 916 hPa ( mbar ; 27 @.@ 05 inHg ) . Additionally , the JTWC assessed the system to have been slightly stronger , estimating peak one @-@ minute sustained winds at 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) . At this time , the storm was estimated to have a Dvorak technique rating of 7 @.@ 0 , equivalent to a Category 5 on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale ; 
 As Cyclone Kathy neared the Australia coastline later on 22 March , it began to weaken as it interacted with land . Radar imagery depicted the system as having an eye 10 @.@ 8 km ( 6 @.@ 7 mi ) in diameter . Roughly 5 hours after peaking , the storm passed directly over the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands , resulting in a degrading structure . Near midnight , the system weakened to a Category 4 cyclone and made landfall in a remote region near Borroloola . Based on a wind gust to sustained ratio of 1 @.@ 4 , Kathy was estimated to have moved onshore with winds between 165 and 185 km / h ( 105 and 115 mph ) . In the hours after landfall , Kathy rapid weakened , no longer retaining gale @-@ force winds once 200 km ( 120 mi ) away from the Gulf on 23 March . Later that day , the system turned south @-@ westward and persisted for another 24 hours before dissipating . 
 = = Impact = = 
 In Far North Queensland , Kathy brought moderate rainfall and strong winds to much of the region . No measurements from the centre of the storm were made , although a wind gust of 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) was recorded in Batavia Downs , Queensland , about 55 km ( 34 mi ) south @-@ southeast of the cyclone . Between 18 and 21 March , a total of 126 @.@ 7 mm ( 4 @.@ 99 in ) of rain fell near Batavia Downs . Due to the relatively low intensity of the storm , damage was minimal and mainly confined to trees . 
 Striking the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands as a high @-@ end Category 4 cyclone , Kathy wrought significant damage in the region . A storm surge of 4 @.@ 2 m ( 14 ft ) struck <unk> Island , destroying much of the nesting ground for sea turtles . Winds were recorded up to 232 km / h ( 144 mph ) before the station 's anemometer failed . Several camps across the islands were destroyed . Offshore , 20 vessels were caught in the storm , one of which sank and three others ran aground . One person perished on board the ship that sank during the storm . Losses sustained by the ships were placed at A $ 5 million ( A $ 12 @.@ 7 million 2011 AUD ; US $ 10 million 2011 USD ) . 
 Though a powerful storm , only light to moderate rains fell along the cyclone 's path with totals generally less than 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) . The remnants , however , triggered thunderstorms near Tennant Creek that produced 325 mm ( 12 @.@ 8 in ) of rain in 24 hours . Reports indicate that several sea turtles and dugongs were washed up to 8 km ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) inland by Kathy 's surge . The only population center significantly affected by the storm was Borroloola , where moderate to severe damage took place . At least one home was destroyed and many more were damaged in the town . Along the mouth of the McArthur River , near where Kathy struck the mainland , the combination of severe winds and storm surge killed 80 % ( ± 20 % ) of the <unk> mangrove trees in the region . Along the entire length of the river , 45 % ( ± 15 @.@ 3 % ) of the <unk> , Bruguiera and <unk> as well as 18 @.@ 5 % ( ± 11 @.@ 4 % ) of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> racemosa and Avicennia marina perished . In all , losses from the storm were placed at A $ 12 , million ( A $ 30 @.@ 5 million 2011 AUD ; US $ 24 @.@ 1 million 2011 USD ) . 
 In the wake of the storm , Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke promised residents of Borroloola that they would receive all possible help from the government . About 400 people in the town were left homeless by Cyclone Kathy . By 25 March , a Royal Australian Air Force aircraft was sent to the region carrying emergency supplies for sheltering displaced persons . Two patrol boats from the Royal Australian Navy were also sent to assist in relief efforts . One brought fuel and medical supplies and the other assisted trawlers set adrift or grounded by the storm . Following its usage , the name Kathy was retired from Brisbane 's list of cyclone names and will never be used again .

 " Just a Kiss " is a song recorded by American country music group Lady Antebellum . It was released on May 2 , 2011 as the lead single from the band 's album Own the Night ( 2011 ) . Dallas Davidson collaborated with band members Hillary Scott , Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood to write the song , taking inspiration from the members ' personal experiences . Produced by Paul Worley , " Just a Kiss " was among the last songs recorded for the album , and is a mid @-@ tempo country ballad with lyrics that speak of a romantic relationship between two new couples .

 After the 53rd Grammy Awards , held in February 2011 , band members Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood said in a backstage interview that work on the group 's third album was almost complete . On May 2 , 2011 , the band digitally released " Just a Kiss " , the lead single from the new project . In a blog entry on their website , the group said that " Just a Kiss " was among the last songs that were written for the album . Haywood commented , " We were about six songs into recording and someone had this idea , so we sat down to write it . " Hillary Scott , Kelley and Haywood wrote the song with Dallas Davidson . Davidson discussed the conception of the song with country music blog Taste of Country : " I went out on the road with them , and we wrote a couple of things . We recorded one song called ' We Own the Night ' . Charles called me as they were about done with the record . He said , ' Man , we want to write again . ' So the band came over [ to my office ] one morning . We started writing this other song . We were trying to find Hillary a little uptempo girl song . We wrote this cool thing . " 
 The next day , Davidson found Haywood in his office , playing the keyboard part which was later revived for the song 's riff . " When we got done with the other song , I kept going back , saying , ' Man , there 's something about what you were playing earlier ... let 's mess with that before we leave . ' So he started playing it again , " Davidson recalled . After the keyboard elements were completed , Scott and Kelley finished the song 's music and lyrics at the studio . They discussed ideas for the song ; Kelley put forward the basic melody and Scott followed up with her own contribution . After they wrote the lyrics , Davidson proposed that the song 's title be " Just a Kiss Goodnight " . It was later changed to " Just a Kiss " after Scott felt that " it 's cool to have ' just a kiss ' goodnight rather than going all the way . " Kelley told Country Weekly that the song was inspired by the band members ' experiences : " I remembered being out the first night with Cassie and thinking , ' This is different , and I don 't want to give any wrong impression . I don 't want to make the wrong move because this feels like something special . ' We started talking about that and going back and forth with different experiences when we wrote the song . " The song was recorded and mixed by Clarke Schleicher , with assistance from Joe Martino and Andrew <unk> . The B @-@ side track , " Bottle Up Lightning " , was written by Kelley , Haywood , Tony Martin and Wendell Lee Mobley . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 " Just a Kiss " was produced by Paul Worley and lasts for three minutes and 41 seconds . The mid @-@ tempo country power ballad opens with piano chords , played by Haywood . The melody builds up as the track progresses , exhibiting elements of pop music and incorporating acoustic guitars . As the " soaring chorus " — sung in three @-@ part harmony by Scott and Kelley and backed by Haywood — starts , beats of " overly dramatic drums " are also heard , as described by music critic Matthew Wilkening . According to Tris McCall from The Star @-@ Ledger , " Just a Kiss " contains the " specific structure " found in Lady Antebellum 's previous songs . This was echoed by John Hill of About.com and Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio , both of whom compared the song 's arrangement to that of " Need You Now " ( 2009 ) . According to the sheet music published by Alfred Publishing Company , " Just a Kiss " is set in common time with a moderately slow tempo of 72 beats per minute . Written in the key of B ♭ minor , it follows a chord progression of B ♭ m7 – A ♭ / C – D ♭ – G ♭ <unk> , and Scott 's vocals range from the note of A ♭ 3 to F5 . 
 The lyrics of the song describe a " tortured romantic scenario " of a newly formed couple 's relationship , which , according to McCall , is enhanced by the piano and guitar arrangements . Kelley and Scott alternate on lead vocals . It speaks of the couple who prefer not to take their romantic relationship further anytime soon , want to take things slow , and are satisfied with " just a goodnight kiss " . McCall also noted that the lyrics portray how the female character 's lines , sung by Scott , attempt to fight back her lustful feelings , and precariously sighs the line " I don 't want to mess this thing up . " Scott told Billboard that " there is so much excitement at the beginning of a new relationship ... all the butterflies and that optimistic feeling that this person could be ' the one ' . This song is about one of those times when your brain kicks in and tells your heart ' good things are worth waiting for . ' " Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote that the song 's production is " emblematic of the album 's midtempo complacency . " Melinda Newman of HitFix noted that the strings " give a nice lift at the end . "

" A Washington Post editor also gave a positive review , declaring " Just a Kiss " as " one of the group 's finest " . Daryl Addison , writing for Great American Country , commended the group 's vocal chemistry in the song , adding that " [ t ] he group 's dynamic allows them to explore a wide range of emotions as they each add their own voice .

Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly also praised " Just a Kiss " and noted that Lady Antebellum sing the song " like they mean it " . He suggested that the song is " classy and very sincere " . Stephen Hyden of The A.V. Club wrote that the song was " painfully chaste " . 
 Matthew Wilkening , writing for Taste of Country , gave the song a score of 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 , writing that the song is " surprisingly serious and dour " in contrast to its subject matter , but he praised the " catchy melody " . It also received 3 @.@ 5 stars out of five from John Hill of About.com , who found it " lyrically lacking " but a " solid contribution to the power ballad genre " . Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine found the song to be repetitive in its lyrical theme , and said that the group was " sticking to the blandly pleasant , cliché @-@ driven songwriting of Need You Now , not taking a single risk . " Tris McCall of The Star @-@ Ledger criticized the song for bearing a close resemblance to " Need You Now " and concluded that " if you swooned for ' Need You Now ' , chances are you won 't be able to resist the tidal pull of this one , either . " Shahryar Rizvi of Dallas Observer was also less enthusiastic about the song , writing that it " seems kinda old @-@ fashioned amongst all the outspoken and steamy acts in the Top 40 . " Rizvi concluded by noting that " maybe the music industry 's just covering their bases by serving the demographic that appreciates sugar @-@ coated love ballads over brash statements ... If not , well , then " Just A Kiss " will probably appear in sappy , modest teenage romantic comedies . If those types of movies still exist . "

 The music video , directed by Shaun Silva , was filmed in Paris , London , and Murfreesboro , Tennessee . The Union Station hotel is featured as a train station in the video . Kelley explained that the director decided to shoot parts of the music video in Europe because he wanted the video to be " as authentic as possible " . The video begins with a young woman , Joy , entering a train and discovering an iPad in her backpack . The iPad has a video of her lover with a sign written in French words that mean " Don 't forget about me , " and also some videos of the couple 's travels throughout London , Paris , and Berlin , after which the couple bid each other farewell . A subsequent scene shows Joy 's boyfriend finding her sitting on a train seat and they share a kiss . Joy is then seen awoken from sleep as a man named Brady , who looks exactly like the boyfriend in Joy 's dream , sits next to her . Brady apologizes for waking her and asks if she minds if he sits next to her . The two make introductions , and Joy mentions her dream . Brady then takes out his iPad case ( exactly the same case as the one Joy had in her dream ) , and smiles at her . Joy smiles back , having experienced this deja vu moment .

 Abrahams Creek ( also known as Abraham Creek , Abraham 's Creek , Abram Creek , or Abrams Creek ) is a tributary of the Susquehanna River in Luzerne County , Pennsylvania , in the United States . It is approximately 10 @.@ 7 miles ( 17 @.@ 2 km ) long and flows through Franklin Township , Dallas Township , Kingston Township , West Wyoming , Wyoming , and Forty Fort . The watershed of the creek has an area of 17 @.@ 4 square miles ( 45 km2 ) and occupies portions of nine municipalities in northeastern Luzerne County . The watershed is divided into the upper Abraham Creek watershed and the lower Abraham Creek watershed , which are joined by a canyon known as The Hollow . The upper part of the watershed is mostly rural , but the lower part is heavily urbanized . The creek 's channel has been heavily modified in many places . Its drainage basin is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery . 
 Abrahams Creek is a perennial stream with relatively poor water quality . However , it is not considered to be impaired . Its pH ranges from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline and has a daily sediment load of nearly 14 million pounds ( 31 million kilograms ) per day . The main rock formations in the watershed include the Catskill Formation , the Llewellyn Formation , the Pottsville Group , the Mauch Chunk Formation , and the Pocono Formation . The main soils include the Chenango @-@ Pope @-@ Holly soil , the Lackawanna @-@ Arnot @-@ Morris soil , the Udorthents @-@ Urban Land @-@ Volusia soil , and the Volusia @-@ Mardin @-@ Lordstown soil . 
 Abrahams Creek is named after a historic Mohican chief of a village in the area . The creek 's watershed was historically heavily logged and farmed and a sediment retention structure was built in the watershed in the 1970s . Numerous bridges have been built over the creek since 1925 . The Abrahams Creek Watershed Association operates in the watershed . A 500 @-@ million @-@ gallon reservoir known as Frances Slocum Lake was built on the creek in 1965 .

The highest point in the watershed is on Bunker Hill , at slightly over 1 @,@ 500 feet ( 460 m ) above sea level . The lowest point in the watershed is at the creek 's mouth . 
 There are plains to the north of Abrahams Creek . Wetlands known as the Abrahams Creek Wetlands are in the vicinity of the creek . They consist of several ponds along the side of the creek in Franklin Township , Kingston Township , and Dallas Township . The wetlands are listed on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory . The creek is in entirely in the ridge and valley physiographic province , specifically , the Anthracite Valley Section . The Bunker Hill @-@ Mount Lookout Ridge crosses the watershed and divides it into two drainage basins : the upper Abrahams Creek watershed , which consists of rolling hills , and the lower Abrahams Creek watershed , which is on a natural debris fan and the old floodplain of the Susquehanna River . Between the two is " The Hollow " , a narrow canyon flowing through the ridge . 
 The course of Abrahams Creek has been altered by flood control projects . There is a sediment retention structure on the creek at the lower end of " The Hollow " . Large portions of the creek , especially in its lower reaches , have undergone full stream channelization , with the stream channel being hardened by concrete or rock . In West Wyoming , a nearly mile @-@ long stretch is lined with concrete . In the early 20th century , part of the creek above The Hollow had grouted stone walls , which were completed in the 1930s . 
 In the Abrahams Creek watershed , 94 percent of the rock is interbedded sedimentary rock . The remaining 6 percent is sandstone . The main rock formations in the watershed of Abrahams Creek include the Catskill Formation , the Llwellyn Formation , the Pottsville Group , the Mauch Chunk Formation , and the Pocono Formation . These formations mainly consist of coal , limestone , sandstone , shale , and siltstone . The Catskill Formation mainly occurs in the watershed 's upper reaches . The Mauch Chunk Formation , the Pocono Formation , and the Pottsville Group occur under the Bunker Hill @-@ Mount Lookout Ridge . The Llwellyn Formation also occurs there , in addition to underlying the floodplain in the watershed . A considerable area in the watershed has been strip mined .

 The watershed of Abrahams Creek has an area of 17 @.@ 4 square miles ( 45 km2 ) . The creek 's mouth is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Pittston . However , its source is in the quadrangle of Kingston . There are approximately 25 miles ( 40 km ) of open stream channels in the watershed . The creek 's watershed is situated in the northeastern part of Luzerne County and occupies portions of nine municipalities : Exeter , Forty Fort , <unk> , West Wyoming , Wyoming , Dallas Township , Exeter Township , Franklin Township , and Kingston Township . The watershed is described as being hourglass @-@ shaped in the Abrahams Creek Watershed Assessment and Project Prioritization . 
 A total of 80 percent of the Abrahams Creek watershed is rural and 20 percent is urbanized . The lower reaches of the watershed contain most of the urbanization . Its upper reaches contain second @-@ growth forest , small patches of residential land , linear hedgerows , and agricultural land such as hay pastures , pastures , and farmland . The Bunker Hill @-@ Mount Lookout Ridge is too steep to be developed , but many other areas of the watershed could easily be urbanized . The mining @-@ affected land in the watershed is in West Wyoming . 
 A total of 51 percent of the watershed of Abrahams Creek consists of forested land . A total of 26 percent of the watershed consists of agricultural land and 18 percent is developed . The remaining 2 percent consists of " disturbed " land . 
 Abrahams Creek is the main source of flooding in West Wyoming , Forty Fort , and <unk> . Sheet flooding can occur when the creek floods over Eighth Street . There is a flood protection project for the creek in West Wyoming . This protection is capable of withstanding 100 year floods . The Slocum Dam , which is upstream of West Wyoming , also helps to reduce flooding on the creek . However , localized flooding and ponding frequently affect its lower reaches . The creek has been experienced extensive modifications , such as narrowing and riprap installation , in The Hollow to accommodate West Eighth Street . 
 Abrahams Creek flows through Frances Slocum State Park and passes through Frances Slocum Lake , a flood @-@ control lake with a volume of half a billion gallons . Most of the upper reaches of the watershed drain into the lake . The creek is also dammed in this location . The lake was created in 1965 by the construction of an earthen dam across the creek . A pond known as <unk> Pond is on a tributary of the creek . It is partially filled and has a decaying stone dam . If the dam collapsed , damage could potentially reach up to 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) downstream . There are numerous other dammed ponds in the watershed 's upper reaches . Historically , wetlands formed the sources of many headwater streams in the area , but many have been drained or flooded by <unk> . 
 The watershed of Abrahams Creek is continuing to become more developed , but at a slower rate than it has in the past . The lower reaches of the watershed are the most heavily urbanized , while the upper reaches are still largely rural . This has been the case as early 1893 . The upper reaches of the watershed have a dendritic drainage system . 
 Abrahams Creek is one of 19 streams in Luzerne County to be designated for stormwater management .

 Abrahams Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2 , 1979 . Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is <unk> . The creek is also known as Abraham Creek , Abraham 's Creek , Abram Creek , or Abrams Creek . The name " Abraham 's Creek " was once the official name of the creek . It was also referred to by this name in an 1860 map . 
 Historically , the Mohicans had a settlement on the banks of Abrahams Creek . The creek is named after Abraham , a chief of that village . 
 Extensive logging and intense agriculture were historically done in the watershed of Abrahams Creek . The area was already beginning to experience road encroachment as early as 1893 . 
 Several bridges have been built over Abrahams Creek . A concrete slab bridge carrying State Route 1021 / East Eighth Street was built in 1925 . It is 38 @.@ 1 feet ( 11 @.@ 6 m ) long and is situated in West Wyoming . A concrete stringer bridge carrying State Route 1010 was constructed over the creek in 1929 . This bridge is 30 @.@ 8 feet ( 9 @.@ 4 m ) long and is also situated in West Wyoming . A concrete tee beam carrying US Route 11 was built in 1939 .

 The entire watershed of Abrahams Creek , including all of the streams and wetlands , has been significantly modified by both historical and modern land uses in the area . The natural surface water hydrology of the watershed was substantially modified by projects of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection from the 1950s until the 1990s . The sediment retention structure in The Hollow was constructed in the 1970s . 
 Abrahams Creek has a watershed association known as the Abrahams Creek Watershed Association . It was awarded the Watershed Stewardship Award by the Luzerne Conservation District in 2009 . The organization also received a $ 5000 grand from American Water for improving water quality , adding riparian buffers , and other projects . Damaging flooding in 2006 caused the Abrahams Creek Watershed Assessment and Project Prioritization to be created . The creek was used as a reference watershed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection when developing a total maximum daily load for the nearby Solomon Creek .

 Nearly all of the watershed of Abrahams Creek is biologically degraded , with the only exceptions being several headwater streams . However , the upper part of the watershed is less severely degraded than the lower reaches . 
 The drainage basin of Abrahams Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery . Wild trout naturally reproduce in a section of a tributary of the creek in West Wyoming . This stretch is 1 @.@ 87 miles ( 3 @.@ 01 km ) long . 
 There is an herbaceous wetland along Abrahams Creek just upstream of where it enters Frances Slocum Lake . Further to the north , there is a flooded forested wetland .

IGN echoed previous opinions , praising the character dynamics , and also questioned the amount of unnecessary fanservice . 
 = Billy Talent = 
 Billy Talent is a Canadian rock band from Mississauga , Ontario . They formed in 1993 with Benjamin Kowalewicz as the lead vocalist , Ian D 'Sa on guitar , bassist Jon Gallant and drummer Aaron Solowoniuk . There have been no lineup changes , although Aaron is currently taking a hiatus from the band due to an MS relapse , Jordan Hastings from Alexisonfire , <unk> and Say Yes is currently filling in for him . 
 The band existed for almost a decade before mainstream success . The members met and played in Our Lady of Mount Carmel Secondary School under the name Pezz and remained underground in Toronto 's indie music scene until 2001 . The band renamed itself Billy Talent after running into legal trouble with the old name . It was then that Kowalewicz 's connection with an employee of Warner Music Canada 's A & R department landed the band a record deal and launched them into mainstream success . Since then , Billy Talent has made three multi @-@ platinum records in Canada , and continues to expand their success overseas , this included touring for 20 months supporting their second album . They released their third album , entitled Billy Talent III , on July 14 , 2009 , and their fourth album , entitled Dead Silence , on September 4 , 2012 . Dead Silence was followed up by a full UK tour over the course of October and November 2012 . To commemorate the longevity since the release of their first studio album , the band has released a greatest hits album entitled " Hits " on November 4 , 2014 .

 The band got together during a high school talent contest . Pezz began writing , performing songs , and gaining attention and credibility at first locally , and soon in Toronto 's broader indie music scene . Their first recording was a cheap 4 @-@ track demo . It was recorded in Ian D 'Sa 's basement in July 1994 , and was named <unk> , after a friend of the band named Jason Deluca had stopped by the house , banging on a basement window while the band was recording . Soon after , in January 1995 , they all put in money to record another demo of better quality with engineer / producer Dave Tedesco at the " Signal to Noise " studio which they called <unk> . Originally , two tracks from <unk> and four newly recorded tracks were compiled onto it , but a year later the band recorded four more tunes live in the studio and re @-@ released it . After these releases and their continued performances in the immediate area , Pezz was gaining a following in Mississauga and it continued to spread . 
 D 'Sa studied classical animation at Sheridan College , and even worked on Angela Anaconda as an animator . Gallant almost finished a business degree . Kowalewicz was in between jobs , one which included working at 102 @.@ 1 the edge . Solowoniuk worked at Chrysler Canada . But during this , each member found the time and finances to max @-@ out their credit cards , and record their first full @-@ length album in 1999 . They laid down twelve tracks at a studio called " Great Big Music " , collaborating with Juno @-@ nominated music producer Brad Nelson . Kowalewicz started singing in melody with D 'Sa . The music began to transform from a " raw rap @-@ rock " songs into " catchy and angst @-@ ridden pop punk anthems " . With that , Watoosh ! was born and independently released . While popular within Toronto 's indie scene , it did not reach large mainstream sales levels . 
 = = = Billy Talent and success ( 1999 – 2004 ) = = = 
 In 1999 , the Canadian Pezz received documentation from an American band named Pezz proving that the latter had held the name internationally since 1989 . The Canadian band had no legal claim to their old name and thus changed it to Billy Talent , inspired by the guitarist " Billy Tallent " from Michael Turner 's novel Hard Core Logo . The film adaptation by Bruce McDonald would be the inspirational medium for the band . However , this still led to fans mistaking Kowalewicz as being named Billy Talent . 
 Now known as Billy Talent , their sound began to move in a more aggressive , punk rock direction . During this time , Kowalewicz ran into Jen Hirst , at 102 @.@ 1 the edge , the Toronto radio station he worked at . She had seen the band perform as Pezz , and he asked her to check out the band 's performance at a club . This would prove to pay off , as Hirst was later hired by Warner Music Canada to work in A & R. This connection would get the band their producer Gavin Brown , and a demo deal with the label . Before the demos were recorded , a local manager called Atlantic Records A & R executives , who were already in Toronto , to see the band perform in its tiny rehearsal space . 
 In 2002 , the band met with record executives , and ended up signing a co @-@ venture agreement with Atlantic Records and Warner Music Canada . In the fall of 2003 , the band released their full @-@ length self @-@ titled album , Billy Talent . The album found considerable sales success . " Try Honesty " was a successful first single , and was followed by other singles " The Ex " , " River Below " , and " Nothing to Lose " into late 2003 and 2004 . The band played sold @-@ out shows in Canada and the United States and had success in Europe . The band received Juno , ( They won two Junos , Best Album of the Year , and Best Band of the Year ) and MuchMusic Video Award nominations and awards , and spent late 2004 and most of 2005 touring . Billy Talent went on to be certified 3x platinum in Canada . 
 A track from the album titled " This Is How It Goes " was about Aaron Solowoniuk 's fight with multiple sclerosis . On March 17 , 2006 , Aaron Solowoniuk revealed in a personal letter to fans that he was the friend in that song . Solowoniuk was confirmed to have the disease , which causes anything from numbness in the limbs to paralysis or loss of vision , in January 1999 . His neurologist prescribed him medication that he would have to self inject three times a week , possibly for the rest of his life . Although it was a struggle for Solowoniuk to come to terms with the reality of the disease , going to numerous doctor appointments and touring with a mini @-@ fridge in their van has become normal routine . The medication has let him continue drumming with the band , as it eliminated his symptoms , and he has stated that " this changes nothing about my band or me . "

 Billy Talent 's second album was mostly recorded at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver , British Columbia , which was produced by Gavin Brown again with Ian D 'Sa co @-@ producing for the first time , and mixed by Chris Lord @-@ Alge . 
 Billy Talent II hit the shelves on June 27 , 2006 . It fared very well in Canada in its debut week , landing in at number 1 on the Canadian charts . It also enjoyed significant success in Germany , where it also debuted at number 1 in the album charts in its debut week , and was one of the top 10 selling albums in the country . As of June 15 , 2007 , the album has sold almost 700 @,@ 000 units worldwide , 215 @,@ 000 of them in Canada making it certified 2x Platinum , and 200 @,@ 000 shipped units in Germany achieved it platinum status there . However , the success did not duplicate itself in the U.S. The band has expressed that they know they are a new band there , and they are choosing to concentrate their attention on Canada , Europe , and other places overseas instead . 
 The album contains less anger and profanity than their previous self @-@ titled album , as they had mellowed out and matured as men and as a band . More of the songs dealt with real @-@ life issues , to the praise of fans and critics . 
 We wanted to do something completely different from the first record because we had changed dramatically and had learned a lot from personal relationships . Everyone in the band is partnering up and dealing with those issues . The general theme of this record is trust , the lack thereof or breaking up . That seemed to fuel the record . 
 The band ventured off on another UK tour in support of Billy Talent II , but this one would include more shows in countries they had not performed in before . During this tour leg , the gigs at London and Manchester , on September 8 and 16 , respectively , were recorded live . Limited edition CDs were released as the band 's only live album to date , Live from the UK Sept . / 2006 .

 Watoosh ! saw the band mixing multiple genres and making diverse songs on the same album , stretching from hip hop to indie and ska punk .

On Billy Talent II , the band altered their sound yet again , based on more mid @-@ tempo and emotional compositions ; a bit more collected than their previous work . It was also based on far less angst and aggression behind the production , things that were known factors behind their debut . In their music there are raw and frequent backup vocals heavily collaborated by main vocals , quick changes between loud and quiet , and Kowalewicz 's characteristic vocals which are the key elements that emphasize that assertion .

 = Food power = 
 In international politics , food power is the use of agriculture as a means of political control whereby one nation or group of nations offers or withholds commodities from another nation or group of nations in order to manipulate behavior . Its potential use as a weapon was recognised after OPEC ’ s earlier use of oil as a political weapon . Food has a major influence on political actions of a nation . In response to acts of food power , a nation usually acts in the interest of its citizens to provide food . 
 Food power is an integral part of the politics of food . The idea of food power is used in embargoes , employment , and food politics . In order for a nation to utilize food power effectively , the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity , supply concentration , demand dispersion , and action independence . The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the United States , Canada , Australia , and New Zealand . On the smaller scale , particularly in some African countries , food power has been used as a weapon by opposing sides in internal wars and conflicts against their own people . 
 = = Historical background = = 
 There are four nations in the world that export enough agriculture to exert this hypothetical food power : the United States , Canada , Australia , and New Zealand . Forced to rely on these nations in times of shortage , food @-@ importing countries may face food crises if needed supplies are withheld . But while political leaders in food @-@ importing countries have expressed misgivings over their dependence , food @-@ exporting nations generally do not withhold food , as agricultural producers in these nations press their governments to continue to export . 
 = = Policy = = 
 Food politics are the political aspects of the production , control , regulation , inspection and distribution of food . The politics can be affected by the ethical , cultural , medical and environmental disputes concerning proper farming , agricultural and retailing methods and regulations . Food power is an integral part of the politics of food . 
 “ Food is a weapon ” , stated Earl Butz , the United States Secretary of Agriculture , in 1974 . OPEC 's use of oil as a political weapon brought on the possibility for America to use food as a tool against other states and to further the US 's goals . There are alternative uses of food power as well . An importer can refuse to continue import unless political concessions are made . This would have the same effects that an exporter refusing to export would have . An example of this would be American reduction of the Cuban sugar quota . In simple terms , the demand concentration ( one importer being the dominant buyer ) and supply dispersion ( several exporters competing to sell the same product ) an importer can try to use this exchange politically to their favor ; this is especially effective if the exporter has little else so export ( low action independence ) . 
 = = = Food power and food security = = = 
 Food security and food power are not the same thing . However , they are often directly related . Food security is when all people of a region at all times have enough food for an active , healthy life . Food power is related when a government , company , leader , country etc. takes this security away in order to get something in return . Many countries employ the exploit of food power to threaten another country 's food security . A country 's welfare correlates directly with the welfare of its people therefore each country wants to have an appropriate supply of food for its citizens . This want , however , can easily be used as leverage in the politics of food , demonstrating food power . 
 = = = Food power and embargoes = = = 
 An embargo is not the same as Food Power , however , food power can be used in an embargo . In fact , embargoes that do not involve food in their list of restricted items often fail . For example , on August 20 , 1914 the Allied Powers began an embargo on important items that were normally shipped to Germany . However , the embargo was not complete nor effective until food was added to the list of restricted materials . Food has the real power . After food was introduced the blockade began to strangle Germany 's economy because they were dependent on imports for food . Because the Allied Powers used the power of food in their embargo , Germany was forced to resort to desperate measures and eventually failed despite them . 
 In the early 1980s , the United States posed a grain embargo upon the Soviet Union . This was an attempt by the U.S. utilize food power , however , it was not confirmed . The Soviets thus imported grain from different suppliers , leading to an increase in grain imports during that time period , only at a higher cost . Another unsuccessful embargo food power attempt was imposed by the UN Security Council in 1990 with Iraq . 
 Another example of an embargo is the United States embargo against Cuba . This is still an ongoing embargo , and , due to the declining situation and health of Cuba 's people , the embargo has been subject to much protest . 
 = = Employment = = 
 = = = Structural conditions = = = 
 Food power can only be used effectively if certain structural conditions apply : 
 Scarcity : If demand is high and supply is limited the value of a given commodity increases . The price often reflects the potential of the goods as a weapon ; as it indicates the importance attached to it . Example : If a consumer is prepared to pay a high price for monetary terms he may also be willing to pay a high price in political concessions . 
 Supply Concentration : Supply should only be in the hands of few producers / sellers , as this makes possible for limited competition , price fixes , or potentially a monopoly . 
 Demand Dispersion : Allows sellers to play the consumers against each other as well as increase prices or make terms conditional . This favors the use of economic goods food as a weapon . 
 Action Independence : In order to ensure <unk> the seller / producer most control his own assets . Either the seller / producer must be able to control the production process , perhaps through governmental control over companies carrying out the production ) , or he must have access to means on the other dimensions to ensure that he can maintain or extend control over his assets . 
 The four conditions listed above MUST be simultaneously present in order to turn an economic asset food into a political instrument . This does not necessarily mean that the asset will be used whenever the four conditions above are present . Such a decision would be considered only if there were further conditions , for example , the nature of a given conflict and judgment , goals , alternative means , and judgment of utility . 
 = = = Employment as an economic weapon = = = 
 There are several uses for employing economic weapons against one country or another . One use for using economic weapons would concern the seller / buyer bargaining on the conditions of a business contract . This would include price , transportation , timetable for consignment and payment , etc . Although this is an example of the successful application of food power , it is not a political objective . Another use concerns the economic objectives other than these relating to the transaction of goods ; to the general economic policy of the buyer . This would be balance of payments , general problems , such as inflation or taxation and land holding . What distinguishes this from the first is the fact that there is no link between the conditions laid down and the transfer of product . The conditions refer to the economic realm of life . A political use would be one concerning the buyer ’ s foreign and defense policies . Many believe there is a moral threshold between economy and politics , making the use of economic means for political gains questionable . Examples of the use of economic weapons for political aims are boycotts against certain countries as well as the buying of votes in the UN . A fourth purpose pertains to the basic assumption of the third category : the governments no longer accept each other as legitimate . The economic goals are no longer seen as a means of influencing an opposite government but rather to stimulate opposition and achieve the overthrow or capitulation of the government .

 During the time the United States was the most dominant in all areas like military , energy , exports , etc . Food Power was not really thought about . However , since some of those powers have since diminished , the power of food has come to the surface . In the realm of food , The United States remains at the top , unchallenged . The United States has the position of being the largest producer and exporter of food . While others nations , predominantly developing nations but even some of the richest oil @-@ exporting nations , are beginning to have food shortages and becoming more and more dependent on imported food from the United States , giving it more and more power . This allows the United States to expect friendly behavior from the countries that import American food . It is also likely that the United States would have some form of influence over these countries . Even some of the poorest OPEC countries have become dependent on U.S. wheat . Therefore , there is a possibility that the United States could restrict its food exports for political purposes . The United States could use this Food power as a means of exerting pressure on OPEC countries . Food power will be most effective in times of food shortage or famine because this is when those countries that have some dependence on the United States are most desperate . 
 The U.S. frequently uses its economic power in order to punish other countries . One of the ways the U.S. does this is by holding back on exporting food . Reasons for the punishment of another country vary ; however , they can be broken down into two main groups : Foreign containment objective and market development / humanitarian objectives . The foreign containment objective tends to punish those countries who are threatening to the U.S. An example of such a threat would be countries under other forms of government . More examples related to the containment objective would be no aid to communist countries , socialist governments , countries who support radical regimes , regimes with an inadequate democracy who are too weak to be anti @-@ communist ( effectively ) , and countries who will not accept U.S. agreements . An example of market development and humanitarian objectives would fall under a category of countries that are trying to compete with the U.S. economically . The U.S. will execute foreign aid punishments to countries trying to nationalize property of U.S. companies , countries who want to take over functions by U.S. companies , and countries trying to initiate nationalistic economic policies . 
 The U.S. has modified its stance since the 1970s , when the State Department and the CIA issued reports exploring the potential of food embargoes . Congressional Bill H.R. <unk> , the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 , removed agricultural export sanctions applied to Libya , Sudan , and North Korea ( agricultural trade with Cuba remained under some restrictions ) and gave Congress veto power over unilateral presidential actions in this regard . 
 = = = Africa = = = 
 Food politics in Africa differs from the cases in North America and Europe in that there is a case of small scale food power in Africa , particularly in Sudan . Some experts say that the cases of famine and food insecurity in Africa are due to inconsistent output of food production and the downward spiral of the interaction between population growth and environmental sustainability . But upon closer inspection , it is revealed that nature is not the only catalyst for Africa ’ s numerous food insecurity issues . 
 = = = = Sudan = = = = 
 Famine is shaped by generally two theories . The first is FAD , Food Availability Decline . This is the result of a drought , a war , or some other drastic change to the agricultural system . This is the natural cause for famine . The other theory deals primarily with the population ’ s ability to access or become entitled to food . In this case , food power makes itself known on a small scale , as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine . 
 For example , Sudan ’ s famine in the 1980s was completely intentional , and was only a pawn for a varied collection of different elites to improve their political and economic statuses . These political parties weren ’ t the only beneficiaries , though . Merchants were also known to hoard grain and buy livestock at inappropriately low prices when the famines shifted the terms of trade . Western Sudanese merchants during the famine of 1987 were described as heartless because they refused to sell grain to needy villages in Darfur at reasonable prices . Ergo , the Sudanese Famine was another example of food power in which food was and used as a policy , and which completely ignored the needs of the people and fostered the political and power @-@ hungry intentions of opposite warring forces in the country . 
 The famine in Sudan in 1998 was a humanitarian disaster caused mainly by human rights abuses , as well as drought and the failure of the international community to react to the famine risk with adequate speed . The worst affected area was Bahr El Ghazal in southwestern Sudan . In this region over 70 @,@ 000 people died during the famine . 
 = Gaylussacia brachycera = 
 Gaylussacia brachycera , commonly known as box huckleberry or box @-@ leaved whortleberry , is a low North American shrub related to the blueberry and the other huckleberries . It is native to the east @-@ central United States ( Pennsylvania , Delaware , Maryland , Virginia , West Virginia , North Carolina , Kentucky , and Tennessee ) . 
 Gaylussacia brachycera is easily distinguished from other members of its genus by its leaves : they resemble those of boxwood ( hence its name ) and lack the resin glands typical of huckleberries . Like its relatives , it bears white urn @-@ shaped flowers in the early summer , which develop to blue , edible berries in late summer . It is mostly found in Appalachia ; many of its stations there were known to natives , who picked and ate the berries , before botanists became aware of them in the 1920s . 
 A relict species nearly exterminated by the last ice age , box huckleberry is self @-@ sterile , and is found in isolated colonies which reproduce clonally by extending roots . One colony in Pennsylvania was once estimated to be as many as 13 @,@ 000 years old ; more recent estimates have an upper bound of about 8 @,@ 000 years , which would make it the oldest woody plant east of the Rocky Mountains . Another colony in Pennsylvania , about 1 @,@ 300 years old , has been protected by the <unk> and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area . 
 = = Description = = 
 Box huckleberry is a low shrub , 6 to 8 inches ( 150 to 200 mm ) tall . Its leaves resemble those of boxwood ( hence its name ) . About 1 inch ( 2 @.@ 5 cm ) long and oval @-@ shaped , they are glossy and minutely toothed , turning red in winter . The evergreen leaves , lacking resin glands , are in sharp contrast to other species of Gaylussacia . Box huckleberry flowers in May and June . The flowers are urn @-@ shaped and white , sometimes tinged with pink . Like other huckleberries , the flowers appear on a raceme springing from the leaf axils . Its fruits , which appear in July and August , are blue berries borne on short pedicels . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Box huckleberry was first collected and described in 1796 near Winchester , Virginia ( probably in what is now West Virginia ) by the botanist André Michaux . Michaux named it Vaccinium <unk> in his Flora <unk> @-@ Americana , published in 1803 . Matthias <unk> , in about 1800 , and Frederick <unk> , in 1805 , also obtained specimens in West Virginia . R. A. Salisbury referred to it as V. <unk> in 1805 , and this remained the prevailing name for the next forty years ; the common name " box @-@ leaved <unk> @-@ berry " was used for the species at the time . 
 No further specimens were collected until 1845 , when Spencer Baird , a professor at Dickinson College , discovered a colony near New Bloomfield , Pennsylvania . It was redesignated G. brachycera in 1846 by Asa Gray on the basis of Baird 's specimens . ( Gaylussacia was not recognized as a genus separate from Vaccinium until 1819 . ) The discovery brought about a friendship between Gray and Baird that ultimately resulted in the latter 's appointment as secretary of the Smithsonian Institution . 
 John Kunkel Small assigned the species , as <unk> brachycera , to a monospecific genus in 1933 . However , this was not widely accepted , and was rejected by other authors on the grounds of both nomenclatural and " phyletic <unk> " . More recently , phylogenetic studies in 2002 suggested that the monophyly of G. brachycera with the remainder of Gaylussacia is " equivocal " , and further analysis of Vaccinium might result in G. brachycera being returned to that genus . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 About 100 separate stations for box huckleberry have been documented in the scientific literature . By the time of Baird 's collection in 1845 , the West Virginia stations of the plant had been lost to science , and his Pennsylvania colony was the only one known for some time . Specimens of box huckleberry were subsequently identified in Delaware in 1870 , by William M. Canby . 
 In 1919 , Frederick V. Coville called attention to the threatened state of the plant in an article in Science . While investigating the species for horticultural purposes , he only found two herbarium specimens , those of Baird and Canby . ( Coville apparently did not locate <unk> 's West Virginia specimen , preserved at the Muhlenberg Herbarium . ) Upon examination of the New Bloomfield site in 1918 , he discovered the entire colony , except for one patch cut off by cultivation , was connected by roots , and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around the margins of the colony . Coville concluded that the plant was self @-@ sterile and reproduced by extending rootstocks . After commercial nurserymen removed a truckload of box huckleberry from the New Bloomfield site in 1918 , Coville was particularly anxious to preserve the species , as the New Bloomfield site was the only one then thought extant . ( It was protected by the state from 1929 , becoming the <unk> and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area . ) However , Edgar T. Wherry was able to locate the Delaware colony , thought lost , in 1919 , and send specimens for cross @-@ pollination with specimens from the Pennsylvania colony . 
 This report stimulated considerable interest in the species . Additional colonies were located in Pennsylvania and Delaware , one in Maryland , several in Virginia , three in Tennessee ( 1920 – 1930 ) , two in Kentucky ( 1927 – 1932 ) , and many in West Virginia ( 1921 ) . In summarizing these discoveries in 1932 , Wherry noted that many of the colonies were already known to local residents , who picked the berries for food , under names such as " juniper @-@ berry " , " ground @-@ huckleberry " , and " bear @-@ huckleberry " . He called for more intensive effort on the part of the scientific community to make use of such local knowledge in determining plant geography . More recently , a colony of box huckleberry was discovered in Durham County , North Carolina , the first report from that state , in 2003 . 
 Most of the reported stations for box huckleberry fall within the Appalachian Mountains , ranging from central Pennsylvania in the north to eastern Tennessee in the south . However , the specimens located in Maryland and Delaware were found on the Atlantic Coastal Plain , and the single North Carolina station is in the Piedmont . Its scattered distribution suggests that the species once spread more broadly across North America , but was almost eradicated by glacial advances , surviving only where it escaped the ice in protected refugia . 
 Box huckleberry prefers dry , acidic soils , including duff , and partial shade . Locations on wooded slopes tend to face north ; however , the New Bloomfield site faces west . At one of the Delaware sites , a small portion of the colony extended to the wet margin of a marsh , but most was located on dry , sandy soil upslope . 
 = = Ecology and human use = = 
 Box huckleberry is self @-@ sterile , so single plants cannot reproduce sexually . Instead , they form colonies which spread by vegetative reproduction along rootstocks . A colony of G. brachycera at Losh Run , Pennsylvania was found to be 6 @,@ 500 feet ( 2 @,@ 000 m ) long when surveyed . If this colony grew clonally from a seed deposited along the Juniata River at the rate of 15 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) per year , it would be about 13 @,@ 000 years old , the oldest living organism in the United States and second oldest in the world , eclipsed only by Lomatia <unk> . However , this is believed now to be an overestimate on climatic grounds . At that time , the site was covered by a boreal forest thought to be too cold for the box huckleberry to survive ; the current forest did not begin to appear at the site until about 8 @,@ 000 years ago . This age would still make it the oldest woody plant in North America east of the Rocky Mountains . Recent studies have attempted to determine whether , in fact , the reproduction of the colony ( since heavily damaged by a forest fire in 1963 and road construction in the 1970s ) has been entirely clonal . Two genotypes were found in samples taken from the colony , but they are thought to have arisen through somatic mutation rather than sexual reproduction . Unfortunately , the destruction of about 80 % of the colony by fire and construction makes it impossible to definitively settle the question . 
 The caterpillar of the moth <unk> <unk> has been reported to feed on the leaves . The berries are eaten by wild turkeys and ruffed grouse . They have been harvested for food by humans in West Virginia , Kentucky , and Tennessee . Rev. Frederick W. Gray , who documented many of the box huckleberry colonies in West Virginia in the 1920s , first took an interest in the plant when served a " juniper " pie , " juniper " being the local name for box huckleberry . However , they are reportedly tasteless . 
 With the cooperation of the United States Department of Agriculture , efforts are under way to promote G. brachycera as a groundcover for use in landscaping . Box huckleberry is commercially available from at least one source but it is difficult to propagate , making it unprofitable for many nurseries to carry . In New Bloomfield , PA , the box huckleberry has become part of the local New Year 's celebrations , as a papier @-@ mâché replica of a huckleberry is dropped , instead of a ball , to mark the new year .

 Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner had worked together on the Metro – Goldwyn – Mayer ( MGM ) television series The Outer Limits since 1995 . Wright saw a wide range of possible science fiction storylines in the original Stargate ( 1994 ) film that could take place in the present day . Meanwhile , Glassner was interested in the feature film 's theme that Ancient Egypt had been partially or completely built by aliens . Upon hearing of MGM 's plan to create a television spin @-@ off series of the film , Wright and Glassner independently and unbeknownst to each other approached MGM and proposed their concept for the television series . MGM president John Symes greenlit the project on the condition that Wright and Glassner worked together as executive producers of the new show . The show was eventually given the name Stargate SG @-@ 1 after Wright <unk> agreed to Symes 's pitch question if the team should be called " SG @-@ 1 " . MGM released posters titled Stargate SG @-@ 1 within the next week without the knowledge of Wright and Glassner . 
 John Symes approached Michael Greenburg and Richard Dean Anderson of MacGyver fame . Although Anderson was never a real fan of the science fiction genre , he believed the original concept of a " Stargate " was a good vehicle for a series . Anderson agreed to become involved with the project if his character Jack O 'Neill was allowed significantly more comedic leeway than Kurt Russell 's character in the feature film . He also requested Stargate SG @-@ 1 to be more of an ensemble show , so that he would not be carrying the plot alone as on MacGyver . The American subscription channel Showtime made a two @-@ season commitment for 44 episodes in 1996 . Principal photography began in Vancouver in February 1997 . 
 " The First Commandment " was the first Stargate SG @-@ 1 episode written by Robert C. Cooper , who would later become an executive producer and co @-@ creator of the spin @-@ off series Stargate Atlantis . Paul McGillion , who played young Ernest Littlefield in " Torment of Tantalus " , would go on to play the recurring and later main character Dr. Carson Beckett in Stargate Atlantis . The outside scenes of " <unk> " were filmed at Pemberton Icefield . The rest of the episode was filmed in the studio , which was filled with fake snow and ice and kept at a low temperature .

 Lead production designer Richard <unk> flew to Los Angeles , 1996 to gather material from Stargate for reference and found the original film prop stored outside in the Californian desert . Although the prop had severely disintegrated , he could take a detailed mould for Stargate SG @-@ 1 production to build its own prop . The new Stargate was engineered to turn , lock the chevrons , and be computer @-@ controlled to dial specific gate addresses . A portable Stargate prop was built for on @-@ location shoots and required six workers and one full day to set up . Since visual effects are sometimes faster and cheaper , a computer @-@ generated Stargate was occasionally used in on @-@ location shoots in later seasons . 
 The design of the Stargate Command ( SGC ) base was supposed to match the real Cheyenne Mountain complex as much as possible . The set had to be twice as high for shooting as the 22 feet tall Stargate prop , but one of <unk> 's original plans of a three @-@ level SGC set was rejected in favor of a two @-@ level set . The gateroom was the biggest room on set and could be redesigned for other scenes . Two multi @-@ purpose rooms were frequently redecorated into the infirmary , Daniel 's lab , the cafeteria or the gym . The SGC set and all other sets from the pilot episode were constructed within six weeks in January and February 1997 , incorporating some original set pieces from the feature film .

 The original airing of " Children of the Gods " on Showtime featured full frontal nudity during the scene showing the possession of Sha 're ( <unk> Bandera ) by <unk> . While this has never been repeated on network television and subsequent airings have had the nudity cut out for syndication ; it was rated R by the MPAA . According to Brad Wright , the Showtime network had insisted on the full frontal nudity despite Wright 's vocal opposition ; Wright told fan site GateWorld that he would cut the nudity scene from the 2009 direct @-@ to @-@ DVD recut of the pilot episode . The DVD version , in fact , only retains a portion of this scene , with full frontal nudity being cut and a partial syndicate friendly back nudity version used . Likely because of the nudity , the original version of this episode as well as the next two episodes of the series are the first and only ones in the series to be rated by the MPAA ( it is rated R ) , while in the UK the episode is rated 18 by the BBFC ( all other episodes have generally been rated PG , or 12 , very occasionally 15 ) . It is rated M in Australia , recommended for ( but not restricted to ) viewers 15 and older . The version available online through streaming is the uncut , original version of the episode . 
 " Hathor " was heavily criticized , and the series ' writers themselves acknowledged the episode 's weakness . Later , in the Season 7 episode " Heroes ( Part 1 ) " , Dr. Fraiser is discussing Jack with the film crew and mentions " the whole Hathor incident , which we were never supposed to speak of again " . " Politics " , was the series ' first clip show , it is widely regarded as one of Stargate SG @-@ 1 's weakest episodes . 
 " Children of the Gods " was nominated for a Golden Reel Award in the category " Best Sound Editing – Television Movies of the Week " and the music for " Best Sound Editing – Television Episodic – Music " . " The Nox " was nominated for an Emmy in the category " Outstanding Music Composition for a Series ( Dramatic Underscore ) " .

 = Paul Palaiologos Tagaris = 
 Paul Palaiologos Tagaris ( Greek : <unk> Παλαιολόγος <unk> , ca . 1320 / 40 – after 1394 ) was a Byzantine Greek monk and impostor . A scion of the Tagaris family , Paul also claimed a connection with the imperial Palaiologos dynasty . He fled his marriage as a teenager and became a monk , but soon his fraudulent practices embroiled him in scandal . Fleeing Constantinople , he travelled widely , from Palestine to Persia and Georgia and eventually , via Ukraine and Hungary to Italy , Latin Greece , Cyprus and France . During his long and tumultuous career he was appointed an Orthodox bishop , sold ordinations to ecclesiastical offices , pretended to be the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem , switched from Greek Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism and back again , supported both the See of Rome and the Avignon anti @-@ popes in the Western Schism , and finally managed to be named Latin Patriarch of Constantinople . In the end , his deceptions unmasked , he returned to Constantinople , where he repented and confessed his sins before a synod in 1394 . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 The main source on Paul 's life is the document of his confession before the patriarchal synod in Constantinople in 1394 , complemented by an account of his visit to Paris , written by a monk of the Abbey of Saint @-@ Denis . 
 Paul Tagaris was apparently a scion the Tagaris family , a lineage which first appears in the 14th century . His father is unnamed , but is described by Paul as a valiant and famous soldier , so that he is possibly identifiable either with the megas stratopedarches Manuel Tagaris , or with the latter 's son , George Tagaris . Tagaris himself also claimed to be related to the ruling imperial dynasty of the Palaiologoi and adopted the surname for himself . Manuel Tagaris was indeed married to Theodora <unk> Palaiologina , a niece of Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos , but even if Paul was Manuel 's son , Theodora was , according to the Byzantinist Donald Nicol , " almost certainly not the mother of Paul " . 
 Tagaris was probably born in the 1320s , or at the latest around the year 1340 . His parents arranged his marriage at the age of 14 , but soon he abandoned his wife and went to become a monk in Palestine . After a while he returned to Constantinople , where , in the words of Alice @-@ Mary Talbot , " his greed led him into scandal and corruption " : he claimed that an icon in his possession had miraculous properties , and made money out of gullible believers . This affair scandalized his family , but Patriarch <unk> I declined to take action against him . It was not until the patriarch went to a visit to Serbia in 1363 that his locum tenens , the <unk> <unk> , confiscated the icon and forced Paul to return to Palestine . 
 = = Career in the East = = 
 In Palestine , Paul managed to be ordained a deacon by the Patriarch of Jerusalem Lazaros , who took him under his protection . Shortly after , however , Lazaros left for Constantinople , and his locum tenens <unk> brought charges against Paul , forcing the latter to abandon Jerusalem for Antioch . In Antioch , Paul once again managed to befriend the newly elected ( 1368 ) Patriarch Michael , who not only ordained him a priest , but eventually made him patriarchal exarch and administrator of the Patriarchate 's affairs . It was not long before Paul began abusing his authority : he sacked serving bishops and put their sees up for sale , threatening to report those who complained to the Turkish authorities . Soon he claimed the title of Patriarch of Jerusalem for himself and began to ordain bishops , even in territories subject to the Patriarchate of Constantinople . In 1370 , he went to Iconium and thence to Persia and Georgia , where , according to his own recollection — no such dispute is recorded in Georgian sources at this time — he adjudicated a dispute among three rival claimants of the throne , finding in favour of the highest bidder . 
 At this point , again according to his own account , he felt remorse and considered returning to Constantinople , where he would give the fortune he had amassed to the poor , but he was forestalled by the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon , who found him and delivered an offer by the Patriarch of Antioch to name him bishop of <unk> ( an unidentified location , variously suggested as being either in the Taurus Mountains or in the <unk> peninsula , i.e. the Crimea ) . Paul accepted , and was apparently consecrated by the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon ( ca . 1375 ) . At the same time , however , the Patriarch of Constantinople <unk> I <unk> heard about his dealings in the east , and at Trebizond Paul was met by a messenger from the Patriarch who demanded his immediate return to Constantinople to stand trial . 
 = = Latin Patriarch of Constantinople = = 
 Reluctant to face the Patriarch 's wrath , Paul once more decided to flee and try his luck in Rome . As Nicol points out , such a move would be highly unusual for an Orthodox priest , but may be explained by the links of his family with pro @-@ Catholic circles in the Byzantine capital : George Tagaris , his putative brother or father , was among those who supported the Union of the Churches and had received letters of encouragement from Pope Innocent VI . To avoid passing near Constantinople , Paul was forced to make a broad detour . He took ship , probably from Trebizond , to the Crimea , where he presented the local governor of the Golden Horde with jewels from the treasure he had amassed . In exchange he secured an escort through the Horde lands for the Kingdom of Hungary , from where he went on to Rome . There he secured an audience with Pope Urban VI , claiming to be the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem . Paul presented himself to the Pope as a penitent , offering a — probably partial — confession of his errors , and to embrace the Catholic faith . Impressed by Paul 's humble demeanour , the Pope named him ( late 1379 or early 1380 ) to the titular post of Latin Patriarch of Constantinople , which had been vacant since September 1378 , when its incumbent , Giacomo da <unk> , had declared his allegiance to the Avignon anti @-@ pope Clement VII . In addition , Urban named Paul apostolic legate for all countries " east of Durazzo " . 
 Paul 's new office — in effect " a second Pope " , as he called it — quickly caused him to become conceited . He abandoned his simple monastic habit and adopted magnificent vestments to suit his new rank , wore ostentatious jewellery , and , according to the chronicler of Saint @-@ Denis , went about on horseback surrounded by a magnificently outfitted entourage . An example of Paul 's splendid vestments and accoutrements at this time is probably the richly embroidered altar cloth , featuring a Byzantine double @-@ headed eagle with a monogram on its breast and the legend " Paul , Patriarch of Constantinople and New Rome " in Greek , now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City . 
 Constantinople having been recovered by the Byzantines in 1261 , since 1314 the seat of the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople had been at Negroponte , which still remained in Latin hands . Soon after his investment , Paul made for Ancona , from where he would take ship for Greece . He remained in the city for several weeks , fêted by the locals , and on 4 March 1380 presented to them the head of James the Just , followed on 17 April by further relics , among them the foot of Saint Anne and a nail from the True Cross , although , as Nicol comments , " one may be tempted to question the authenticity , and still more the provenance , of his donation " . The documents of grant , preserved in the cathedral of Ancona , are signed by Paul and a certain " Alexios Palaiologos the Despot " , allegedly a son of the Byzantine emperor but in reality , according to Nicol , probably " another figment of Paul 's fertile imagination " . 
 From 1380 until 1384 , Paul remained at his see in Negroponte . A relative of his , George Tagaris — probably a different person than Manuel Tagaris ' son — was called in to help with the administration of the patriarchal domains . His tenure was troubled : the local Orthodox clergy appealed to the Venetian authorities for protection against his exactions , the Latin Archbishop of Athens , Antonio Ballester , complained of the Patriarch 's interference in his diocese , and his lease of some of the Church lands in 1383 to a Venetian from Crete , Giacomo Grimani , proved a source of protracted legal trouble since Grimani , in the words of Raymond @-@ Joseph Loenertz , " revealed himself as much a scoundrel as the Patriarch " . In 1384 , Paul was once again denounced as an impostor to the Pope , possibly by Ballester , who was named vicar @-@ general of the Patriarchate in the same year , and who had held the same office during the 1378 – 79 vacancy . Paul had apparently left his diocese before his denunciation , and resumed his wanderings . In 1385 , he was in Cyprus , where he crowned James of Lusignan as King of Cyprus in exchange for 30 @,@ 000 gold coins , and continued granting ecclesiastical appointments on the island as if he were still patriarch . 
 In 1388 he decided to return to Rome , possibly hoping that the accusations against him had been forgotten in the meanwhile . In the event , he was arrested , tried and imprisoned , but was released after Urban VI 's death in October 1389 and the general amnesty granted by the new pope , Boniface IX . Leaving Rome , Paul went to the court of Amadeus VII of Savoy . There he presented himself as a distant relative to the Count — a claim likely relying on his tenuous links to the Palaiologoi , who in turn were remotely linked to the House of Savoy via Empress Anna of Savoy , Amadeus VII 's great @-@ aunt — and as a victim of papal persecution on account of his support for the Avignon papacy . While Amadeus probably did not put much store in Paul 's dubious claims of kinship , he was moved by the plight of a fellow Avignon supporter , and accepted him as the legitimate Latin Patriarch of Constantinople . He provided Paul with money and an escort of twelve horses and twelve servants , and sent him on to the papal court of Avignon . 
 Paul received a magnificent welcome at Avignon , where he was fêted by Clement VII and his cardinals . Clement , moved by his guest 's tales of suffering at the hands of the Roman popes , loaded him with gifts and honours and sent him north to Paris . There , King Charles VI of France likewise prepared a triumphal welcome for his illustrious guest . Paul was an exotic and popular sight in the French capital , and was lavishly hosted and entertained . He obviously enjoyed his long sojourn there , " safe in a place where his past was unknown and his deception was unlikely to be discovered " , according to Nicol . For additional safety , he communicated only via an interpreter in his employ . On his visit to the Abbey of Saint @-@ Denis , he claimed that there were several relics of the abbey 's patron saint — commonly confused with the Athenian saint Dionysius the Areopagite — to be found back in Greece , and promised to help the monks bring them to France . His proposal was enthusiastically taken up , and two monks received permission and funds from the king to accompany Paul back to Greece . When the party arrived in the port in Italy from which they would sail for Greece , however , Paul bribed the captain of the ship to pretend that bad weather would delay their departure . In the same night , he and his servants set sail at night with their entire baggage , leaving the two monks behind . It was only in Rome , where they went in search of answers for Paul 's behaviour , that they learned the true identity of their travelling companion , and from where the chronicler of the abbey later received his information .

 According to Donald Nicol , the achievement of the " accomplished sinner " Paul was without parallel : " No @-@ one ever made such a profitable business out of changing sides , first in the schism between the Greek and Latin Churches , and then in the schism between the pope in Rome and the pope in Avignon . It is no mean feat to arrive in Rome as orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem and then to be received in Avignon as catholic patriarch of Constantinople . " 
 Now , however , having irreparably destroyed his reputation and ties with both papal courts , Paul was left with no option other than to return to Constantinople , perhaps motivated , in view of his advancing old age , by confessing his sins and receiving absolution . In 1394 , he was back in the Byzantine capital , where he appeared before Patriarch Antony IV , to whom he confessed his sins , abjured his conversion to Catholicism , and pleaded for mercy . As Nicol writes , " Only on one point did he protest that he had been wrongfully accused ; for , despite rumours and tales contrived against him , he had never indulged in fornication , miracle @-@ mongering , or the practice of magic " . The Patriarch passed Paul 's case on to the full patriarchal synod , before which Paul was obliged to repeat his confession twice , and then once more before an assembly of the people . The records of these sessions , kept by the patriarchal scribe <unk> , are the main source on Paul 's life . The final portion of the manuscript , containing the final verdict , is missing , but both the synod and the people had recommended a pardon , so that it is likely that he was forgiven . Nothing further is known of him after that . 
 = 2006 – 07 Bristol Rovers F.C. season = 
 The 2006 – 07 season was the 124th year of football played by Bristol Rovers , and their 80th season in The Football League , and covers the period from 2006 @-@ 07 @-@ 01 to 2007 @-@ 06 @-@ 30 . After finishing sixth in Football League Two , Rovers won the playoff final for the first time in their history , and won promotion for only the fourth time since joining The Football League . The previous promotions were all automatic , and came in the 1952 – 53 , 1973 – 74 and 1989 – 90 seasons . 
 The season began with a subdued atmosphere among fans , caused by six previous seasons of poor performances and a bitter boardroom split , resulting in four directors leaving the club . However , as the season progressed the team gradually climbed up the league and reached the fourth round of the FA Cup , and the final of the Football League Trophy .
