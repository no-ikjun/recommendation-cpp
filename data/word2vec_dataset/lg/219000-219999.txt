 K @-@ 34 was first designated before 1932 in Wilson and Montgomery counties . That route began at K @-@ 96 and ran east to K @-@ 16 . Around 1936 , another segment of the route was designated in Cherokee County , east of the rest of the route , from Crestline to the Missouri state line . In 1937 , the portion of the western segment of the route located west of US @-@ 75 was re @-@ designated as K @-@ 37 , the eastern segment of the route was renumbered as K @-@ 26 , and K @-@ 34 was re @-@ designated in the southwestern portion of the state from the Oklahoma state line to its current northern terminus . The segment of the highway north of US @-@ 160 replaced the former K @-@ 41 designation . 
 At the time of its designation , not all of K @-@ 34 was paved . The segment in Ford County and the concurrency with US @-@ 160 was paved , but all other segments were either gravel or dirt . By 1948 , all of the route was paved except a small portion in Comanche and Clark counties , which was still gravel . No dirt segments remained by 1948 . 
 In 1965 , the K @-@ 34 designation was realigned so that it extended straight north from the intersection with US @-@ 160 and US @-@ 183 instead of overlapping those highways and traveling east . This realignment caused the route to bypass Comanche County entirely , and by 1967 , the whole highway was paved . In 1993 , the concurrency with US @-@ 183 was removed from the route . The route has not been modified since 1993 .

 The Lillesand – Flaksvand Line ( Norwegian : Lillesand – Flaksvandbanen ) or <unk> was a 16 @.@ 59 @-@ kilometer ( 10 @.@ 31 mi ) railway between Flaksvand ( now called <unk> ) and Lillesand in Aust @-@ Agder , Norway . The private line was built with 1 @,@ 067 mm ( 3 ft 6 in ) narrow gauge and was not connected to the national railway network . The line opened on 4 June 1896 , and remained in use until 15 June 1953 . It was built to carry lumber , but also featured a passenger service and other cargo transport . After 1908 , the line was unprofitable and only had a limited service . Plans to connect it to the Sørland Line were proposed but rejected . The line had four stations and four halts , and was served with two 75 kilowatts ( 100 hp ) steam locomotives , Lillesand and Flaksvand . The line was owned and operated by the private company , A / S Lillesand – Flaksvandbanen , although nearly all the shares were held by local municipalities , the county and the national government .

 The 16 @.@ 59 @-@ kilometer ( 10 @.@ 31 mi ) line was built at a minimum standard and as cheaply as possible . It had 1 @,@ 067 mm ( 3 ft 6 in ) narrow gauge , with the steepest <unk> at 3 @.@ 33 percent , a minimum curve radius of 60 meters ( 200 ft ) and a track weight of 60 kilograms per meter ( 145 lb / yd ) . The line had four stations : Lillesand , <unk> , Birkeland and Flaksvand . In addition , there were four halts between Lillesand and <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , Storemyr and Eikeland . 
 In addition to the main line , there were 11 branches and spurs , totaling 1 @,@ 550 metres ( 5 @,@ 090 ft ) . At Lillesand Station , there was a station building , a wagon depot , a locomotive depot and tracks to the docks . At <unk> , there was an extra parallel track and at <unk> , there was a branch to a gravel pit . Extra tracks were laid at Storemyr for parking of wagons and at <unk> , there was a spur to load lumber . At Eikeland there three spurs , including one 600 metres ( 2 @,@ 000 ft ) long to a stone quarry . At <unk> , there was a spur for loading lumber , and at Tveite , there were three spurs , of which two went to the sand pit at <unk> and one to Myhre <unk> . North of Tveite , there was a spur to leave part of the train if the locomotive needed to take two trips to get up the hill . At Birkeland Station , there were two extra tracks , one for stationing cargo trains and one to the sawmill . At Flaksvand Station , there were five tracks , of which three were at the station , one to the sawmill and for loading lumber . 
 In Lillesand , the right @-@ of @-@ way has been converted to a road around the city center , although parts have been converted to a pedestrian path . Other parts have been reverted to agricultural land . From Storemyr , the route went through a forest , and has become an overgrown forestry road . From Eikeland to Tveite , the line has been converted to a hiking trail . At <unk> , there are few remains of the line , although when leaving the village , part of the line is used as a pathway . Further along , the route is disused , but fenced in . The station buildings at Tveite and Flaksvand have been kept , the building at Lillesand has been preserved , while the station at Birkeland was dismounted because it was in the way of a new road . 
 = = History = = 
 Public debate about constructing a railway from Lillesand up the valley following the river <unk> started in the mid @-@ 1880s . At the time , lumber was being floated down the river , but low levels of water was causing irregular operations and the piling of lumber in Flaksvand . In 1889 , the government for received an application for a concession . Costs were estimated at NOK 462 @,@ 000 and the line was passed by the Parliament of Norway on 22 June 1891 . At the same time , the line received a state funding of NOK 200 @,@ 000 . Half of this was share capital , the other half was a subsidy . Aust @-@ Agder County Municipality also gave a grant of NOK 20 @,@ 000 , and bought shares for the same amount . Of the share capital of NOK 417 @,@ 350 , NOK 850 was from private investors and the rest from municipalities . The largest owner was Lillesand Municipality , who bought shares for NOK 181 @,@ 000 . Concession was granted by royal resolution on 31 August 1892 , and lasted 30 years from the date of the opening of the railway . 
 Construction was subcontracted to Nicolay Nicolaysen <unk> of Bergen . Without any machines , the whole line was built by hand using tools and explosives . The line opened on 4 June 1896 . Two steam locomotives from <unk> Maschinenfabrik were delivered in May 1895 and given the names Lillesand and Flaksvand . The locomotives weighed 15 tonnes ( 15 long tons ; 17 short tons ) and had a power output of 75 kilowatts ( 101 hp ) . Three passenger cars were bought along with 34 freight cars . Most of the rolling stock remained in use until the closing of the line , at which time they were scrapped . The initial service was two daily round trips , shortly afterwards increasing to three . The peak freight transport was reached in 1902 , when 53 @,@ 207 tonnes ( 52 @,@ 367 long tons ; 58 @,@ 651 short tons ) were transported . It fell rapidly , and from 1906 it was never higher than 20 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 20 @,@ 000 long tons ; 22 @,@ 000 short tons ) . Also the passenger traffic fell , with the peak reached in 1900 , when the line had 26 @,@ 000 passengers . In addition to lumber , an important customer was Myhre <unk> , which produced peat . 
 By 1908 , the railway was losing money , of which two @-@ thirds was covered by the state and one @-@ third by the municipalities . During the planning of the Sørland Line , it was proposed that the Lillesand – Flaksvand Line be converted to standard gauge and extended to <unk> , allowing the two lines to connect . Other proposals involved extending the line from Flaksvand to <unk> and from Lillesand to <unk> . In 1928 , the operating company , A / S Lillesand – Flaksvandbanen , started a parallel bus route . By 1930 , only 845 passengers were transported by rail , with ridership falling further in the following years . By then , there was only a single , combined freight and passenger round trip per day . From 2 March 1942 , this was reduced to when needed , and eventually transport was only done during summer . In 1951 , the railway transported 269 passengers and 4 @,@ 915 tonnes ( 4 @,@ 837 long tons ; 5 @,@ 418 short tons ) . The last train ran on 15 June 1953 , and the line was officially closed on 1 July .

 Susannah F Constantine ( born 3 June 1962 in Hammersmith , London ) is an English fashion journalist , advisor , television presenter , author and designer . Her second book , entitled What Not to Wear , has won her a prestigious British Book Award and sold 670 @,@ 000 copies . 
 Constantine was born into a wealthy family ; her father was successful in property and shipping sectors . She was privately educated as a child and went on to date British royalty , David , Viscount Linley , during the 1980s . Constantine has been involved in fashion for a long period , originally working in America for Giorgio Armani and then John Galliano in London . She met Trinny Woodall in 1994 who both proceeded to write a weekly fashion column , Ready to Wear . They founded Ready2shop.com , a dot @-@ com fashion advice business , and wrote their first fashion advice book in 2000 , Ready 2 Dress , both of which failed . From there they were commissioned to BBC Two to host the style series , What Not to Wear , from 2001 to 2005 . She made regular appearances as a style advisor on The Oprah Winfrey Show and following her success on the shows , she went on to co @-@ host Trinny & Susannah Undress ... on ITV in 2006 and Undress the Nation in 2007 . Constantine and Woodall have now dressed over 5 @,@ 000 women . 
 She has co @-@ written many fashion advice books with Woodall , some of which have become best @-@ sellers in the United Kingdom and United States . It is estimated that her various style advice books have sold 2 @.@ 5 million copies in Britain and the United States . Constantine and Woodall have designed their own clothing range for Littlewoods which made its debut in 2007 , followed by the release of their latest fashion advice book , The Body Shape Bible . 
 = = Education = = 
 Constantine was privately educated at boarding schools including Queen 's Gate School in South Kensington , London and the £ 20 @,@ 000 @-@ per @-@ year St Mary 's School in Wantage , Oxfordshire which was run by Anglican nuns . Her time at St Mary 's School was described by herself as " miserable " due to her homesickness and insecurity , meaning she was not able to make friends . She was first sent to boarding school at the age of 11 years , and recalls her first night away from home : " I sobbed uncontrollably into my pillow . " 
 In mid @-@ 2007 , Constantine spoke about how she received a letter from St Mary 's School , inviting her to come back to the school to talk about her career and success to current pupils . Constantine immediately declined the offer with a four @-@ letter refusal and wrote " No fucking way " on the letter she had received . Her personal assistant , who was left to deal with the situation , wrongly sent the original letter of invitation ( containing Constantine 's hand @-@ written note ) back to the school . The school then wrote a letter back , stating that she is not welcome near the school . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Constantine originally did a year of Montessori training after she had left school but she then moved onto other projects such as studying sculpture in Brussels . She later said of this time that she " lost [ her ] virginity , went a bit mad . " Constantine had taught children for three years , and also worked as a shop girl for Harrods . She found the job , in her own words , " boring " and even tried shoplifting for the sake of excitement , but she has since expressed admiration for shop girls . Constantine 's love for horses had inspired her to become a mounted policewoman in London , but was deterred when she found she was required to do four years walking the beat . She wrote a book about present giving , which prompted The Daily Telegraph to write a hostile article implying she had never done a day 's work in her life , something which deeply upset her . She has stated defiantly " I 've always worked . " 
 She is now best known as a fashion guru and style advisor . Her fashion career started when she worked for many years as a shop girl in America for Giorgio Armani . She later came back to London with the hope of securing a job with Armani but ended up working for designers such as Richard James , Patrick Cox , Alistair Blair and John Galliano which gained her an even greater understanding of fashion , providing an in depth knowledge of how a garment progresses from a sketch . She then started working with the British Brain and Spine Foundation and consequently met the sports editor of The Daily Telegraph . Whilst doing a piece for GMTV , he asked Constantine to report the women 's World Cup Final in cricket on finding out that it was her passion . She proceeded to write about cars and then fashion . 
 In 1994 , she first met Trinny Woodall at a party hosted by David , Viscount Linley . Though they did not like each other at first , the two women proceeded to write Ready to Wear , a weekly style guide for The Daily Telegraph which ran successfully for seven years . The column promoted affordable high @-@ street fashion and they used themselves to illustrate which clothing suited which figure . Constantine and Woodall also became the co @-@ founders of Ready2shop.com , a dot @-@ com , but the business venture failed , and investors subsequently lost a reputed £ 10 million . It was during their time running the internet business that they had a serious argument that almost ended their friendship . 
 Constantine made her television debut when Granada Sky Broadcasting signed her and Woodall to present a daytime shopping show called Ready to Wear , and they soon released their first fashion advice book , Ready 2 Dress in 2000 . The book was unsuccessful and resulted in the <unk> of 13 @,@ 000 copies . Soon after the start of their television career , they secured a frequent makeover slot on the show Richard & Judy . It ensured that they had further exposure in television and gained attention from Jane Root , controller of BBC Two , who took a risk and signed them up after their book venture and their internet business had failed badly .

 Constantine began co @-@ hosting What Not to Wear with Trinny Woodall in 2001 , which required using her fashion advice and expertise in order to reform participants ' appearances and fashion style . Constantine and Woodall hosted What Not to Wear until 2005 and became renowned for their tactile behaviour with the participants , direct advice , and frequently referring to breasts as tits which has become something of a trademark . Never one to hold back , a notorious moment arose when Constantine spontaneously pulled a female candidate 's underwear down during filming as her knicker line was visible . Critics of What Not to Wear argued that the duo were too patronising to their subjects , a claim which they strongly disagree with . Constantine said that the comments come " from the heart " , and insists that their subjects " see we have a genuine love of women . We love women and they can see that . Women just know . " She also stated " Ultimately , what we 're doing is giving people confidence . We 're probably the only people who have an opinion , who care how ordinary people dress . No one at Vogue magazine gives a shit . They work with the designers , it 's more creative and artistic – they are creating something beautiful . But they don 't care about how their readers end up looking – whereas we do ! " The show made Constantine and Woodall household names and they are now known together as Trinny and Susannah . One reporter has simply referred to Constantine as " the one with ' big tits ' . " Constantine and Woodall have even considered taking insurance out on their partnership should something unforeseen happen , although Constantine was against the move . 
 Constantine has the belief that " anyone can achieve style . It doesn 't matter who you are or where you 're from . " She also says that she finds dressing other women easy , but finds it difficult when dressing herself . Constantine and Woodall share the belief that dressing to flatter body shape is vital , stating " For us , it ’ s all about shape , and how that is going to cure a bodily defect . We ’ re like clothing doctors . " 
 During her time co @-@ hosting What Not to Wear for five series , she and Woodall gained recognition for their work on the show , winning a Royal Television Society Award in 2002 for being the best factual presenters . In 2002 , Constantine advised Jeremy Clarkson on a celebrity version of What Not to Wear . After Clarkson appeared on the show , Nasir Khan stated " I 'd rather eat my own hair than shop with these two [ Constantine and Woodall ] again " . Adding to its success , the show was nominated for the Features Award at the <unk> in both 2002 and 2003 . On the show Big Impression , impressionist Ronni Ancona took to spoofing Constantine 's presenting techniques on What Not to Wear , just one of the shows on which Constantine 's character has been spoofed . 
 For charity , in 2002 during the BBC 's Children in Need programme , both Constantine and Woodall performed their own version of Madonna 's hit single " Vogue " with a group of celebrity backing singers . They became the faces of Nescafé in 2003 in which they were featured in television advertisements promoting the brand of coffee . As part of their contract , Constantine and Woodall gave a Nescafé competition winner a £ 10 @,@ 000 makeover .

 Following its ratings success , What Not to Wear was promoted from BBC Two to BBC One in 2004 , and secured even larger audiences . The format was changed slightly , to a 60 @-@ minute show with two makeovers instead of a 30 @-@ minute show with only one makeover and also saw Constantine spending a day as one of her subjects . What Not to Wear soon gained her international fame when it was aired in countries such as Spain and Portugal as well as in the American continent . 
 Constantine appeared on Children in Need in 2004 , which included a special segment in which she gave the fictional EastEnders characters Little Mo and Mo Harris a makeover in the style of What Not to Wear , commenting on them with her usual " no nonsense " approach . In 2005 , Constantine voiced a robot version of herself in the science fiction series , Doctor Who . In the episode " Bad Wolf " , Trine @-@ e and Zu @-@ Zana were two robots acting out a deadly futuristic version of What not to Wear , offering a makeover to Jack Harkness in a most gruesome form . 
 The Oprah Winfrey Show has also seen Constantine and Woodall appearing regularly as a makeover and style experts giving fashion advice and guidelines on how to better overall appearances and giving numerous American women fashion makeovers . They also did an " Oprah bra and swimsuit intervention " . Reflecting on differences in women 's style and willingness to submit to makeovers between the UK and America , she stated that although there is not much difference , " The Americans are slightly less adventurous , " and that " American women are more open to change and slightly more receptive victims . "

 In 2006 , Constantine and Woodall moved from the BBC to ITV in a deal reputedly worth £ 1 @.@ 2 million to start a new show , Trinny & Susannah Undress ... , on 3 October . The second series of Trinny & Susannah Undress ... was transmitted in June 2007 , and it maintained the format of series one which saw Constantine and Woodall advising couples who were finding problems within their marriage . 
 Constantine found it warming that people could open up to them as confidantes , and also said " It 's been fascinating to see how looking good and having faith in your appearance makes you into a sexier person , which makes you attractive to your partner again . " Constantine stated in an interview that filming the show was very emotionally draining , and as a result , she often went home crying . The programme did not come without its critics who questioned the depth at which Constantine and Woodall could deal with serious issues raised during the programme . On 16 October 2006 , they both appeared on NBC 's The Today Show and performed makeovers on three women especially for the show . 
 The new series on ITV saw a change in format , confronting the main fashion issues in Britain . In one episode exploring the theme of age , Constantine was transformed into a seventy @-@ year @-@ old with the use of prosthetics and makeup . She stated that it took her four days to get over the sight of herself aged so drastically , and compared the feeling to having an " electric shock " . Broadcasting was scheduled for 7 November 2007 and the programme is newly entitled Trinny & Susannah Undress The Nation . On 5 November and 28 December 2007 Constantine and Woodall appeared on Good Morning America and performed makeovers on three women for the show and gave style advice according to the women 's shapes . They also reported on the fashion at the 80th Academy Awards especially for the show in 2008 . Constantine and Woodall have dressed over 5 @,@ 000 women as of 2007 . With reference to their personal website , they state that their satisfaction remains with the many women they have helped and inspired and not so much with the success of book sales and viewing figures . 
 In 2003 , when Constantine and Woodall were interviewed for the first time on Parkinson , actress Meg Ryan had a controversial interview with Michael Parkinson , which resulted in negative publicity for Ryan . Parkinson said that he felt Ryan 's behaviour to his fellow guests Constantine and Woodall , whom she turned her back on , was " unforgivable " . 
 In 2015 Constantine flew to Australia to compete in the fifteenth series of I 'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here . She became the first to be eliminated after having the fewest votes on 27 November 2015 .

 With Woodall , Constantine became the face of the home shopping company , Littlewoods Direct , after orders rose by thirty per cent when Littlewoods sponsored their ITV programme Trinny & Susannah Undress . The pair produced a twelve @-@ page fashion advice section within the Littlewoods catalogue and made a booklet called The Golden Rules , which was distributed to all Littlewoods customers with fashion advice to suit a range of body shapes . They have also produced online style guidelines for Littlewoods . 
 The first series of Littlewoods television advertisements featured Constantine and Woodall as themselves dressed as two agents trying to rob a Littlewoods designer warehouse , which was followed by Christmas adverts in 2007 . The £ 12 million advertising campaign is one of largest ever for a home shopping and internet @-@ based company . Since the campaign began , Littlewoods ' sales have risen by 18 per cent , with brand awareness and customers visiting the website rising as well . 
 On 20 September 2007 , Constantine and Woodall launched their own exclusive Littlewoods women 's clothing range which consists of trousers , coats and tops which like their underwear range , are designed to make certain areas appear slimmer . A series of eight dresses , cashmere knitwear , faux fur and sequinned shrugs also feature in the range . She commented " If you want to create a waist , there 's a dress that 's going to do that for you too . We 've designed it very much around the female body . " She also stated " It 's not about what size you are , it 's about how you can minimise or accentuate parts of your body with clothing . That 's what we 've created . "

 Constantine has co @-@ written several style advice books with her fashion partner Trinny Woodall , which have sold over an estimated 2 ½ million copies worldwide . The fashion advice books have been number one bestsellers in Britain and the United States , appearing on both the Sunday Times bestseller list and The New York Times best @-@ seller list , and have been translated throughout the world . 
 Their most successful book to date , What Not to Wear , was published in 2002 which displayed striking chapters such as " Big Tits " , " No Tits " and " Big Bum " with fashion advice for each category . It became an instant best @-@ seller with total sales reaching 670 @,@ 000 copies , consequently outselling Jamie Oliver and Nigella Lawson .

Other success with the book includes winning a British Book Award in 2003 for the TV & Film Book of the Year . Despite the book becoming an instant hit , Constantine and Woodall were only given an advance of £ 10 @,@ 000 . It was then reported that Constantine and Woodall secured a £ 1 million book deal to write more of their fashion books . 
 The pair 's latest book , The Body Shape Bible , was published on 18 September 2007 . Through a survey about different body shapes conducted amongst women , Constantine and Woodall were able to discover the twelve most common women 's body shapes . They used this information to write The Body Shape Bible which highlights these twelve shapes which have all been named in ways such as ' cornet ' or ' brick ' . In the fashion advice book , women can interpret which shape they are , and can then be given adequate fashion advice on their own individual shape . A few pages in the book are also devoted to illustrating some of Constantine and Woodall 's own fashion disasters .

 Constantine grew up in an old priory in the Leicestershire village of <unk> and went hunting from the age of seven . She had a close relationship with her sister Annette Constantine and her father , Joseph Constantine , who was successful in the property and shipping sectors , was an Old Etonian pupil and served in the Coldstream Guards . When she was young , Constantine would rely on her father for fashion advice and has commented that any style that she has , she learned from him . He was a talented artist and was offered worldwide art exhibitions , although he was too modest to accept . His death came suddenly and was a milestone for Constantine . 
 Constantine became a fixture in 1980s British gossip columns and newspapers as the result of her relationship with Princess Margaret 's son , David , Viscount Linley which lasted for eight years . Princess Margaret thought highly of Constantine and even called her " my daughter @-@ in @-@ law " . Constantine admitted that her relationship with Linley undeniably opened doors for her , but after they broke up , she was keen to put the episode behind her and become well known in her own right . She has also had a relationship with Pakistan cricket captain Imran Khan , but she is now married to Danish entrepreneur and businessman Sten Bertelsen , who launched Death cigarettes , and with whom she has three children ; Joe , Esme and CeCe . Constantine and her family bought a 120 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 49 km2 ) property in Sussex . Constantine is estimated to be worth £ 5 million . 
 After having her first child , Constantine suffered from severe postnatal depression and panic attacks . Upon discovering that she was pregnant for a third time , as well as being overcome with delight , she felt despair as it came at a time when best friend Trinny Woodall was struggling to conceive and undergoing IVF treatment . In an interview Constantine said that she " couldn 't bear to tell her . " A short time later however , Woodall became pregnant . 
 Constantine has spoken of the pressure to look good in public but affirms " We 're as much in the business of dressing ourselves – but more importantly helping other women to do that . " Constantine has admitted to a fear of growing older : " I just don 't want to get old . Old women are invisible , and I don 't want to be invisible , " she has said . 
 In 2002 , while on a visit to the Cannes Film Festival , Constantine and Woodall were the victims of gem thieves . The thieves broke into the villa on the French Riviera where they were staying , rendered Constantine and Woodall unconscious with chloroform , and then continued to steal money and jewellery . Carol Vorderman was involved in a feud with Constantine and Woodall in 2003 . Vorderman commented harshly about the double @-@ act , referring to them as ' <unk> and the Horse ' , based on their appearance , after they had called her an " overdone Eighties nightmare " and named Vorderman in their list of the 20 worst @-@ dressed celebrities .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and as of 2014 , broadcast worldwide . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1900 race by twenty lengths , while Oxford led overall with 32 victories to Cambridge 's 24 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Oxford 's coaches were G. C. Bourne who had rowed for Oxford in the 1882 and 1883 races , Harcourt Gilbey Gold ( Dark Blue president the previous year and four @-@ time Blue ) and C. K. Philips who had represented Oxford four times between 1895 and 1898 .

The umpire for the race for the twelfth year in a row was Frank Willan who won the event four consecutive times , rowing for Oxford in the 1866 , 1867 , 1868 and 1869 races . 
 Author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater wrote that the Dark Blues " created a sensation " when they elected to row in a boat designed by Felix Warre , based on that built by Matthew Taylor of Newcastle upon Tyne for the 1857 race . Of the crew , Drinkwater remarked " the material of which [ they were ] built was second class , but behind Culme @-@ Seymour a , and coached by Mr. Gold ... they attained very nearly to first @-@ class pace " . The Cambridge crew suffered illness in practice and in a late reorganisation , " the crew received a set @-@ back from which they never really recovered . "

 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 2 @.@ 675 lb ( 77 @.@ 2 kg ) , 1 @.@ 375 pounds ( 0 @.@ 62 kg ) per rower more than their opponents .

Conversely , Oxford saw five former Blues return to the boat , including rower Warre and cox Gilchrist Maclagan who were making their third appearance in the event . All of the participants in the race were registered as British . Seven of the nine Cambridge crew members were studying at Trinity College . 
 = = Race = = 
 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford . Heavy rainstorms and strong wind from the south @-@ west made for inclement conditions for the race . Willan started the race at 10 : 31 a.m. and Oxford , taking advantage of the bend in the river , gradually drew away from their opponents to hold a half @-@ length lead by the Mile Post . The Cambridge stroke Graham Macdowall Maitland spurted to ensure that the crews were level by the time they passed Harrods Furniture Depository . Oxford 's stroke rate dropped as they conceded ground to the Light Blues around the long side of the bend and dropped in behind them . Despite being closer to the shore , the water was still very rough and Cambridge struggled . 
 However , Oxford found it impossible to move out into the rougher water to pass Cambridge and settled behind the Light Blues until near to Barnes Bridge where Maclagan moved and Culme @-@ Seymour simultaneously spurted . As a result , they began to overlap the Cambridge , and with the bend of the river in their favour , they levelled the race as the crews passed Mortlake Brewery . Encountering more rough water , Cambridge were unable to respond and Oxford passed the finishing post two @-@ fifths of a length ahead , in a time of 22 minutes 31 seconds . It was the Dark Blues ' first win in three years , and the slowest winning time since the 1877 race . The victory took the overall record in the event to 33 – 24 in favour of Oxford . 
 = Small @-@ toothed sportive lemur = 
 The small @-@ toothed sportive lemur ( Lepilemur microdon ) , or small @-@ toothed weasel lemur , is a primate species in the family Lepilemuridae that — like all lemurs — is endemic to Madagascar . The species lives in dense rainforest in southeastern Madagascar , and can be found in Ranomafana and Andringitra National Parks . Described in 1894 , it was considered either a subspecies or taxonomic synonym of the weasel sportive lemur ( Lepilemur mustelinus ) throughout most of the 20th century . Phylogenetic studies not only support its species status , but also suggest that it is the only eastern Malagasy sportive lemur that is more closely related to western than to other eastern species . 
 According to the original description , some of its teeth are smaller than those in other sportive lemurs . It is relatively large for a sportive lemur , and is difficult to visually distinguish from the weasel sportive lemur . The species weighs between 0 @.@ 9 and 1 @.@ 2 kg ( 2 @.@ 0 and 2 @.@ 6 lb ) and measures 55 to 64 cm ( 22 to 25 in ) from head to tail . Its fur is mostly reddish @-@ brown or chestnut color , with a dark stripe running from its head down its back . Its underside and neck are lighter in color . Like other sportive lemurs , it is nocturnal , sleeping in concealed tangles of vegetation as well as tree holes . The small @-@ toothed sportive lemur is solitary and eats leaves , fruits , and flowers . 
 Due to recent taxonomic changes and a lack of clarity about its population size and range , it is listed as " Data Deficient " by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . It is also protected from international commercial trade under CITES Appendix I. Its primary threats are habitat loss to slash @-@ and @-@ burn agriculture and hunting . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The small @-@ toothed sportive lemur or small @-@ toothed weasel lemur , a member of the sportive lemur genus ( Lepilemur ) , was first described in 1894 by Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major , based on a specimen found in the <unk> Forest in the eastern districts of the former Betsileo province in central Madagascar . Although Forsyth Major did not explicitly state the origins of either the scientific name or the vernacular name , he did note that it had smaller molar teeth relative to other sportive lemurs . The species name microdon is derived from the Ancient Greek micro- , meaning " small " and <unk> , meaning " tooth . " 
 Until the 1990s , there was some dispute over the taxonomic status of the species . For much of the 20th century , the small @-@ toothed sportive lemur was considered a subspecies of the weasel sportive lemur ( Lepilemur mustelinus ) . In his book The Primates of Madagascar from 1982 , primatologist Ian Tattersall deviated from the traditional view by considering L. microdon a synonym of the weasel sportive lemur , while also recognizing only a single species of sportive lemur . Tattersall based his decision on what he considered to be a lack of detailed anatomical studies and field surveys , while also factoring in the difficulty in observing the animals in the wild , the presence of only subtle variations among museum specimens , and his own unwillingness to consider differences in karyotypes as grounds for defining distinct species . However , primatologist Russell Mittermeier , et al. in Lemurs of Madagascar ( 1994 ) , taxonomist Colin Groves in Mammal Species of the World ( 2005 ) , and others favored recognizing the small @-@ toothed sportive lemur as a species while also recognizing a total of seven sportive lemur species . 
 A cytogenetic ( chromosome ) study by Nicole <unk> , et al. published in 2005 added strong support to the species status of the small @-@ toothed sportive lemur by demonstrating that its karyotype was distinct from all other sport lemur species . The species has 24 chromosomes ( 2n = 24 ) ; the autosomal pairs ( not sex chromosomes ) include eight that are <unk> or submetacentric ( where chromosome arms are equal or unequal in length , respectively ) and three smaller acrocentric pairs ( with the shorter chromosome arm difficult to observe ) . Both the X and Y chromosomes are acrocentric . The study also showed that the small @-@ toothed sportive lemur was the sportive lemur species most genetically distinct from the weasel sportive lemur , despite their similar appearance . A total of 18 chromosomal rearrangements distinguished the two species , indicating that if the two shared the same range , hybrids would be either completely sterile or suffer greatly reduced fertility . 
 In September 2006 , Edward E. Louis , Jr . , et al. announced the discovery of 11 new species of sportive lemur based on mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) data . Each new species resulted from the splitting of existing species . In the case of the small @-@ toothed sportive lemur , the population at Kalambatritra Reserve became known as Wright 's sportive lemur ( Lepilemur <unk> ) , the population as Andohahela National Park became <unk> 's sportive lemur ( L. <unk> ) , the population in <unk> became Betsileo sportive lemur ( L. <unk> ) , and the population at Manombo Reserve became James ' sportive lemur ( L. <unk> ) . The small @-@ toothed sportive lemur remains a distinct species , while even more species have since been described , though none within its range . 
 Between 2006 and 2009 , three studies were published to resolve the phylogenetic relationships between the sportive lemurs . <unk> and molecular studies in 2006 and 2008 concluded that the small @-@ toothed sportive lemur is most closely related to the Milne @-@ Edwards ' sportive lemur ( Lepilemur edwardsi ) . In 2009 , a study examined every known species , including the species most recently described , using two pieces of mtDNA : the D @-@ loop and an array of genes known as the PAST fragment . The resulting data placed the sportive lemurs into four groups : Section A from northern and northwestern Madagascar , section B from northwestern Madagascar , section C from west central and southern Madagascar , and section D from eastern Madagascar . Only the small @-@ toothed sportive lemur generated conflicting results when comparing the results between the mtDNA and D @-@ loop data . The PAST data placed it in section B , while the D @-@ loop data placed it in section C. The relationship between the small @-@ toothed sportive lemur , an eastern Malagasy species , and a group of species from the west coast of Madagascar suggests that the ancestral population of the small @-@ toothed sportive lemur dispersed to its current range from western Madagascar using river corridors . However , the conflicting data about the relationship of the small @-@ toothed sportive lemur to either section B or section C render the precise dispersal route uncertain . 
 = = Description = = 
 Compared to other sportive lemurs , the small @-@ toothed sportive lemur is relatively large , weighing between 0 @.@ 9 and 1 @.@ 2 kg ( 2 @.@ 0 and 2 @.@ 6 lb ) and measuring 55 to 64 cm ( 22 to 25 in ) from head to tail . Its head @-@ body length is 27 to 32 cm ( 11 to 13 in ) , and its tail measures between 25 and 29 cm ( 9 @.@ 8 and 11 @.@ 4 in ) . The species is nearly identical in coloration to the weasel sportive lemur and it is almost impossible to separate the two in the field , except on the basis of geography . The small @-@ toothed sportive lemur has a dark stripe in the center of its forehead that lightens as it runs down the back . Its pelage ( fur ) is thick and reddish @-@ brown , while its underside and neck are pale gray @-@ brown , and sometimes have a yellowish or yellowish @-@ gray hue . The shoulders and forelimbs have a bright chestnut color . The color darkens to russet between the shoulders , down to the hind @-@ limbs and tail . The tail is darkest at the tip . Some individuals are reported to have a characteristic collar of white fur . 
 Like all sportive lemurs , they can easily be confused with woolly lemurs ( genus Avahi ) , and sometimes with the much smaller dwarf lemurs ( genus Cheirogaleus ) . Unlike the woolly lemurs , sportive lemurs have prominent ears , and they lack the white patches usually found on the thighs of woolly lemurs . All sportive lemurs have long legs compared to their arms and trunk and the face is covered with short hairs . 
 According to a review by Henry Ogg Forbes in 1894 , the species differs from other sportive lemurs — as its name suggests — by having significantly smaller molar teeth . Forbes also claimed that compared with the weasel sportive lemur , its bony palate is longer and it has a depression at the base of the nasal ( nose ) region . Like other sportive lemurs , the cecum ( beginning of the large intestine ) is enlarged , presumably to handle its leaf @-@ rich diet , which is more characteristic of larger primates . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 The small @-@ toothed sportive lemur is found in inland southeastern Madagascar , ranging from Ranomafana National Park southwest to Andringitra National Park . The <unk> River acts as the northern border of its range , and the <unk> River may act as a southern border , where the species seems to be replaced by the James ' sportive lemur . Further studies are needed to clarify its range and relationship with other sportive lemurs in southeastern Madagascar . The species inhabits dense rainforest . 
 A preliminary study at Ranomafana National Park in 1995 indicated the small @-@ toothed sportive lemur may avoid competing with woolly lemurs for food ( interspecific competition ) by living in more disturbed areas of the park . Woolly lemur population density ( and thus competition for food ) appeared to affect the species distribution more than the availability of sleep sites . 
 = = Behavior and ecology = = 
 Like all sportive lemurs , the small @-@ toothed sportive lemur is nocturnal , sleeping in tree cavities or hidden tangles of vines and leaves during the day . The species is considered solitary , and like other rainforest @-@ dwelling sportive lemurs , they vocalize significantly less than sportive lemurs that live in drier forests . Other similarities with the rest of the sportive lemur species include its diet of leaves , fruits , and flowers , its low resting metabolic rate , and its low activity rate . 
 In general , predators of sportive lemurs include diurnal birds of prey and carnivores , such as the fossa . The only recorded instance of predation on the small @-@ toothed sportive lemur was by a Henst 's goshawk ( Accipiter <unk> ) . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 The small @-@ toothed sportive lemur is listed under CITES Appendix I , which prohibits international commercial trade . The IUCN originally listed the species as " Lower Risk " , first in 1996 under the sub @-@ classification " least concern " , and then in 2000 under the sub @-@ classification " near threatened " . Prior to the taxonomic changes that resulted in many new species of sportive lemur , the small @-@ toothed sportive lemur was considered to have a widespread distribution , but its range is now thought to be more restricted . During its 2008 assessment , its population size , geographic range , and other factors were unclear , resulting in the classification " Data Deficient " . Given the known threats the species faces , and as its distribution becomes better known , the IUCN states that the species may merit " Threatened " status in the future . 
 Like many species of lemur , it is threatened with habitat loss from slash and burn agriculture and by increasing hunting pressure . It is hunted with spears and is also captured when trees with sleeping holes are cut down . The small @-@ toothed sportive lemur is known to occur in both Ranomafana and Andringitra National Parks , although it may also be found in Midongy du sud National Park . However , this national park is at the extreme southern end of its geographic range , and the sportive lemurs there may actually represent a population of <unk> 's sportive lemur . 
 According to the International Species Information System ( ISIS ) , no small @-@ toothed sportive lemurs were maintained in captivity as of 2009 . 
 = Riverview Theater = 
 The Riverview Theater is a neighborhood movie theater in the Howe neighborhood of Minneapolis , Minnesota . Designed by Liebenberg and Kaplan , the theater was built by theater owners Bill and Sidney Volk in 1948 . After building a subsequent theater in a new ultramodern style , the Volks returned to the Riverview in 1956 and had its lobby area heavily renovated and updated . The Riverview remains one of several surviving single @-@ screen cinemas in the Minneapolis – Saint Paul area and typically shows second @-@ run films for $ 2 or $ 3 , as well as other special programming . Since the early 2000s , it has been consistently recognized by City Pages as one of the best movie theaters in the area . 
 = = History = = 
 The Lithuania @-@ born Volk brothers , Bill and Sidney , came to Minnesota in the early 1920s and got involved in the movie business by purchasing neighborhood theaters during the Great Depression . In 1946 , the Volks initiated what the publication Greater Amusements called a " theater @-@ building orgy " when they received a permit from the Minneapolis City Council to build the first new theater in Minneapolis in twelve years in spite of the protests of other theater managers . The Riverview was designed by architectural firm Liebenberg and Kaplan and built in 1948 in the Streamline Moderne style . It opened December 30 , 1948 , with a showing of June Bride . The single @-@ screen theater utilized stadium seating , making it one of the earlier movie theaters to do so . 
 Three years later , the Volks again called on Liebenberg and Kaplan to construct the Terrace Theater in Robbinsdale , Minnesota , " one of the first ultramodern theaters in America " , and considered by author Larry Millett to be " their masterpiece " . Pleased with the results ( and the industry @-@ bucking receipts ) , the Volks turned back to the Riverview and had Liebenberg and Kaplan remodel it to reflect the successful Terrace model . This occurred in 1956 , eight years after the theater 's initial construction . The new lobby space was intended to reflect a living room and even included a separate TV lounge . Amenities were ample : " Dunbar tables , <unk> stools , Herman Miller <unk> and chairs , walnut panels imposed on light wood , graceful modern lamps , stunning draperies . " Inside the theater space , however , little changed about the proscenium stage and seating . 
 The Riverview became one of the few remaining single @-@ screen theaters in the Minneapolis – Saint Paul area ; by the end of the 1980s , it was one of only six left , and after 1998 , it was one of only four left , with the Uptown and Parkway Theaters and the Oak Street Cinema , although since 1998 , several new single @-@ screen theaters – the Trylon Microcinema and the Heights Theater – have opened . The owners installed new seats in 1999 that allowed for greater leg room and more space between patrons . 
 = = Contemporary status = = 
 The Riverview is located in Minneapolis 's Howe neighborhood and seats over 700 patrons . It typically shows second @-@ run films for between $ 2 – 3 per ticket and its concessions are also " much cheaper than at the suburban multiplexes " . Sometimes , other events are shown , including midnight movies , sporting events , film festivals , and political events such as Barack Obama 's first inauguration in 2009 . Take Up Productions , operator of the nearby 50 @-@ seat Trylon Microcinema , sometimes uses the Riverview for screenings too large for the Trylon to accommodate . The theater won City Pages ' Best Budget Movie Theater award in 2000 , 2004 , and 2005 , and the Best Movie Theater award every year from 2006 to 2014 except 2011 and 2012 . The Riverview 's lobby remains largely unchanged from its 1956 renovation .

 = Dusky woodswallow = 
 The dusky woodswallow ( Artamus <unk> ) , is a bird species of forests and woodlands in temperate and subtropical regions , extending into tropical areas around the Atherton Tableland , in eastern and southern Australia . The global population of the species has as yet not been formally confirmed , but it has been officially rated in the range of ' Least Concern ' , according to the BirdLife International in 2004 . As such , the bird could be described as common in its local habitat . 
 The name " woodswallow " is a misnomer as they are not closely related to true swallows . Instead , they belong to the family Artamidae , which also includes butcherbirds , currawongs and the Australian magpie . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The dusky woodswallow was first described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 with the binomial name Loxia <unk> . Its specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek words <unk> ' blue ' and pteron ' wing ' . 
 = = Description = = 
 The dusky woodswallow is medium @-@ sized and swallow @-@ like , with a dark brown hue , but there have been instances where the bird has appeared grey . The birds have a black patch in front of the eyes , and grey ( sometimes also black ) wings with white streaks on them . The dusky woodswallow has a black , white @-@ tipped tail with a silver underwing . The birds have a blue @-@ grey bill capped with black . Dusky woodswallows are known to spontaneously ' wag ' or swivel their tales fervently , a trait which is common among many other species of woodswallow . 
 = = = Relations to other woodswallows = = = 
 In a significant difference from other woodswallows , dusky woodswallows have a distinctive white patch on the outer wing . Dusky woodswallows also seem to typically be more smoky brown than other species of woodswallow . The little woodswallow , a smaller , darker woodswallow is also slightly more smoky brown that other woodswallows , but that is the only similarity that the latter has with the dusky woodswallow ; the little woodswallow does not share a white patch on the outer wing . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The birds live primarily in open eucalyptus forests and woodlands . They range mostly from Atherton Tableland , Queensland , down to Tasmania and west to Eyre Peninsula , in South Australia . They roost communally , usually nocturnally . During the breeding season , they nest in large flocks to make sure to keep predators away from young . These flocks can be 20 @-@ 30 dusky woodswallows in size . 
 Dusky woodswallows adhere to seasonal migration and movements . The birds are a nomadic species , and tend to move quite spontaneously . However , one certain change of habitat occurs for the south @-@ eastern birds , who migrate northward for Autumn . 
 <unk> roosting birds , the dusky woodswallow has a variety of chattering calls which are used in certain situations . The most distinctive of these calls is perhaps the one which is used when a predator or intruder approaches , which consists of a harsh mobbing call to warn others . 
 = = Feeding and diet = = 
 The diet of the bird can be varied . They eat various forms of foliage and other grassy material that they find on the ground on in trees and shrubs . Dusky woodswallows have been seen eating termites , butterflies and other insects . They also eat nectar from flowers . One notable aspect of their feeding habits is the way they hunt flying insects , which is done by picking them up on their wing . They do , however , also eat their prey from the ground , and they often find inconspicuous places to perch while waiting for prey , such as utility lines and the like . They have also been observed engaging in kleptoparasitism , working as a group to rob a restless flycatcher of its prey . Kleptoparasitism is extremely unusual in passerine birds , as is cooperative <unk> in general . 
 = = Breeding = = 
 The nest of the dusky woodswallow consists of twigs , roots and other similar foliage matted together to form a bowl shape , which is lined with grass . It is positioned safely , behind bark , and / or high in a tree branch , and sometimes in a hollowed out tree stump . The nest is made during the period from August to January , and with the help of several birds . The mated pair will then guard the nest , while others will help them take care of the babies . The female lays white eggs , of which there are usually no more than three or four . While the incubation period lasts for sixteen days , the amount of time taken for fledgling can be this long to around twenty days . The typical clutch is three to four in size , but this may vary . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 The dusky woodswallow has a very large range . The population size of this bird has not yet been quantified or estimated . It is , however , expected to be as populous as other birds within its densest range labeled ' common ' . Because of this , the dusky woodswallow is evaluated to be of Least Concern ( LC ) . This classification may change with new evidence , so is not to be taken with complete accuracy . 
 = Operation Royal Flush = 
 Operation Royal Flush was a military deception employed by the Allied Nations during the Second World War as part of the strategic deception Operation Bodyguard . Royal Flush was a political deception which expanded on the efforts of another Bodyguard deception , Operation Graffham , by emphasising the threat to Norway . It also lent support to parts of Operation Zeppelin via subtle diplomatic overtures to Spain and Turkey . The idea was that information from these neutral countries would filter back to the Abwehr ( German Intelligence ) . Planned in April 1944 by Ronald Wingate , Royal Flush was executed throughout June by various Allied ambassadors to the neutral states . During implementation the plan was revised several times to be less extreme in its diplomatic demands . Information from neutral embassies was not well trusted by the Abwehr ; as a result , Royal Flush had limited impact on German plans through 1944 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Operation Royal Flush formed part of Operation Bodyguard , a broad strategic military deception intended to confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead @-@ up to the Normandy landings . Royal Flush developed a series of political misdirections in mid @-@ 1944 to support other deceptions between June and July . It evolved from Operation Graffham , a political deception aimed at Sweden between February and March 1944 . 
 Graffham was suggested and planned by the London Controlling Section ( LCS ) with the aim of convincing the Swedish government that the Allies intended to invade Norway , in support of Operation Fortitude North . During the war Sweden maintained a neutral position , and had relations with both Axis and the Allied nations . It was therefore assumed that if Sweden believed in an imminent threat to Norway this would be passed on to German intelligence . Graffham was envisioned as an extension of existing pressure the Allies were placing on Sweden to end their neutral stance . By increasing this pressure the head of the LCS , Colonel John Bevan , hoped to further convince the Germans that Sweden was preparing to join the Allied nations . 
 Royal Flush was also intended to support Operation Zeppelin , the 1944 overall deception plan for the Middle Eastern theatre . Zeppelin developed threats against Greece and Southern France between February and July . Its intention was to tie up German defensive forces in the region during the period of D @-@ Day . 
 = = Operation = = 
 Royal Flush was planned in April 1944 by Ronald Wingate , deputy controller of the LCS . His theory was based on the idea that the Allied nations might rely on forms of help from neutral countries following any invasions . Having seen the implementation of Operation Graffham , and with the deceptions aimed at Scandinavia and the Mediterranean , he chose Sweden , Turkey and Spain as the targets . For Sweden this was the continuation of Graffham , with demands from the US , UK and Russia that the Germans be denied access to the country following an Allied invasion of Norway . In the case of Turkey this was built on existing pressure , applied from the outset of the war , to join the Allied nations . 
 In Turkey the plan called for diplomatic pressure on 8 June 1944 , following the Normandy Landings , to allow the Allied forces access to Turkey for the purposes of staging an invasion of Greece ( in support of the story of Zeppelin ) . At the same time the Russians would make a similar request of Bulgaria . However , it was agreed that this risked a pre @-@ emptive invasion of Turkey by German forces . Instead , the Allies took advantage of German warships being permitted , in June , access to Turkish territorial waters to transit to the Aegean Sea . A complaint to the Turkish government emphasised the Allies ' interest in the Balkans and that they did not wish to see the Germans reinforcing the region . 
 On 3 June , Spain was approached by the US ambassador with a request to use Spanish ports for evacuating the wounded , following landings in southern France . Originally the plan had been to request access for the purposes of staging the initial invasion . However , this was toned down in light of historical resistance to any foreign occupation of Spanish soil as well as the implausibility of invading France via the Pyrenees . On 5 June the British ambassador reinforced the request , and after some discussion the Spanish government agreed but only after an invasion had occurred , and under the supervision of the Red Cross . To emphasise the change in objective , the Allies followed this up with Operation Ferdinand which threatened an invasion in Italy . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Information from neutral countries , such as those targeted by Royal Flush , had limited impact on German plans . In July 1944 a report by the Abwehr identified these countries as " outspoken deception centres " . To make matters worse for the Allies , these political deceptions were not as tightly controlled as the double agents , and so as an overall information channel they could be confusing and disjointed . 
 The complaint to Turkey had a desired effect locally , with an apology from the country 's government and a commitment to breaking diplomatic ties to Germany if required . However , it failed to elicit a response from Germany . The Allies ' request to the Spanish government was relayed to the Germans , but identified almost immediately as deception and misdirection . 
 = 1941 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1941 Atlantic hurricane season was the period during 1941 in which tropical cyclones formed in the Atlantic Basin . It was a relatively inactive hurricane season , with only six known storms . It officially began on June 16 , 1941 , and lasted until November 1 , 1941 . These dates delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones tend to form in the Atlantic basin . Of the six cyclones , four attained hurricane status , and three became major hurricanes . The active season had an abnormally late start ; the first system formed on September 11 , nearly three months after the official beginning date . The season was also short @-@ lived , as all six storms developed in rapid succession . On September 23 , three hurricanes existed simultaneously in the Atlantic basin . 
 In total , the season resulted in about 63 fatalities and over $ 10 million in damages . The first and last storms of the season were largely insignificant , although the second , fourth , and fifth storms had considerable effects . Two hurricanes struck the United States : a major hurricane that struck Texas and Louisiana in late September , disrupting the Louisiana Maneuvers , and Hurricane Five , which made two landfalls in Florida , the first of which was near Miami at Category 2 intensity , inflicting widespread damage . Another major storm — Hurricane Four — traversed the Caribbean before striking the Nicaragua – Honduras border at Category 4 intensity , leaving 47 men dead at sea .

 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Tropical Storm One = = = 
 The first storm of the 1941 season formed on September 11 in the northern Gulf of Mexico . This was an abnormally late start to an Atlantic hurricane season : only on two other occasions between 1887 and 1941 had no storms developed prior to September 11 . The storm moved slowly in a generally westward direction for the next few days , peaking as a moderate tropical storm with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . It then weakened until it made landfall along the northern Texas coast between Galveston and Port Arthur as a tropical depression , where it caused only minor damage . Near 0600 UTC on September 16 , the storm deteriorated into a depression , and dissipated a few hours later . 
 = = = Hurricane Two = = = 
 Little more than a day after the first storm of the season dissipated , a tropical depression formed on September 17 in the central Gulf of Mexico about 120 mi ( 190 km ) north of the Yucatán Peninsula . Upon forming , the system began moving generally northward . Early on September 18 , the system developed into a tropical storm more than 300 mi ( 480 km ) to the south @-@ southeast of New Orleans , Louisiana . Over the next three days , the intensifying storm executed a gradual clockwise loop , moving to the south @-@ southeast before turning back to the west . After intensifying to a Category 1 hurricane on September 21 , the storm began assuming a more northwestward course , toward the Texas Gulf Coast . It continued to strengthen into a major hurricane , peaking at 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) late on September 23 . About four hours later , at about 22 UTC , the storm went ashore east of Bay City , Texas , on September 23 . The estimated minimum central pressure fell to as low as 942 millibars ( 27 @.@ 8 inHg ) . It curved towards the northeast , passing just east of Houston , and accelerated as it continued to move inland . The cyclone transitioned into an extratropical storm on September 25 , and was last recorded at 00 UTC on September 27 over northeastern Quebec , near the Torngat Mountains National Park . 
 Warnings and advisories declared in response to the storm were widely distributed , and approximately 25 @,@ 000 people in the area evacuated their homes . Officials completed various precautionary measures . Wind gusts along the coast reached up to 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) , and high storm tides were recorded . The hurricane inflicted severe damage ; destruction to property was worth an estimated $ 2 million , with an additional $ 5 million in damage to crops , notably rice and cotton . Overall , the cyclone killed four people . The hurricane affected the southern Louisiana region one week before the Louisiana Maneuvers , a prelude to World War II . Heavy rainfall triggered flooding and swelled rivers , and army vehicles became stuck in the mud as a result . The inclement weather forced hundreds of military aircraft to move inland for shelter . 
 = = = Hurricane Three = = = 
 Early on September 18 , squally weather was reported throughout the Atlantic coast of Florida , with indications that a circulation center was present 150 mi ( 240 km ) offshore . It is estimated that a tropical storm had formed at around this time . The cyclone began to intensify as it briefly moved northeastward , before abruptly executing an eastward turn . It attained Category 1 hurricane status on September 19 , and completed a clockwise loop the next day . It then tracked northwestward toward North Carolina , but began to recurve away from land late on September 22 . It weakened into a tropical storm shortly afterward . The system dissipated on September 25 to the south of Nova Scotia . The storm had little or no effect on land , but caused significant delays for North Atlantic shipping . One vessel en route from Curaçao to New York encountered the storm on two separate occasions , recording Force 8 winds on the Beaufort scale both times . 
 = = = Hurricane Four = = = 
 On September 23 , a minor area of disturbed weather was observed about 75 mi ( 121 km ) to the northwest of Barbados . It is estimated that it developed into a tropical storm shortly thereafter . Tracking westward , it passed just south of St. Lucia and emerged into the Caribbean Sea . By September 25 , the storm had reached hurricane strength . Still intensifying , the storm continued generally westward and reached its peak at Category 4 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . By late September 27 , the hurricane was situated near Cape Gracias a Dios , Honduras , and accelerated as it moved across the northernmost stretch of the country . It maintained hurricane intensity despite moving over mountainous terrain . After briefly entering the Gulf of Honduras , it moved ashore again in Belize , with winds of up to 85 mph ( 137 km / h ) . Gradually weakening , the storm continued inland and weakened to a tropical storm by September 29 . The storm emerged over the Bay of Campeche as a tropical depression and dissipated on September 30 while over water . 
 Approximately 47 lives were lost at sea due to the hurricane . The SS Ethel <unk> displayed a " sinking " message on September 25 , about 125 mi ( 201 km ) north of Aruba ; she later went down with 20 of her 33 crew members . Two other ships sent out distress signals , one of which capsized , all hands lost . Damage on land was also extensive , and three people drowned at Cape Gracias , which was largely destroyed by the storm . Coastal flooding in the town was severe . Inland , a ship encountered the calm eye of the cyclone , and the barometric pressure aboard fell to 957 mb ( 28 @.@ 3 inHg ) ; the actual pressure at the coast was believed to have been far lower . In Belize , forests sustained major damage . For example , in the Melinda region , high winds brought down about 10 % of the large pines .

 Tropical Storm Five was first observed to the north of the Virgin Islands on October 3 . The storm tracked generally westward on October 4 , strengthening to its peak intensity of 120 miles per hour ( 190 km / h ) at 12 UTC the next day . Now a Category 3 hurricane on the modern @-@ day Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale , the storm struck Cat Island , causing major damage . However , the rapidly moving storm soon weakened as its track bent more to the northwest . At 00 UTC on October 6 , the eye of the storm passed south of Nassau . Ten hours later , the small hurricane struck the north end of Elliott Key , Florida , and then made a second landfall within the hour on the mainland at Goulds , near Homestead . Winds at landfall reached 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) , and the calm eye was reported over Goulds . After moving across southern Florida , the storm had weakened to a strong tropical storm , but then restrengthened as it curved northwestward over the Gulf of Mexico . At about 09 UTC on October 7 , the storm made another landfall along the Florida Panhandle near Carrabelle with winds of 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) . Turning toward the north and northeast , it crossed Georgia and South Carolina , and entered the Atlantic Ocean on October 8 . The storm fully dissipated several days later . 
 Preparations for the storm were extensive ; residents boarded up homes and businesses , while evacuations were recommended in some coastal areas . In the Bahamas , where winds reached 104 miles per hour ( 167 km / h ) , the storm killed three people . The city of Nassau was struck particularly hard , though damage elsewhere in the islands was also severe , with many homes reported destroyed . In Florida , damage was relatively severe , and included the deaths of several people . High winds brought down trees and power lines , and wind @-@ driven salt water damaged vegetation well inland across Dade County , though the storm was characterized by unusually light rainfall . Storm surge in the Everglades region flooded local streets , particularly at Everglades City . As the storm progressed northward , the city of Tallahassee suffered widespread power outages and damage to numerous vehicles . Throughout the state , the hurricane inflicted $ 675 @,@ 000 ( 1941 USD ) in damages . The cyclone later killed one person in Georgia . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Six = = = 
 A tropical storm formed on October 15 , and passed through the southern Bahamas . It crossed the Florida Straits , and reached its peak intensity with winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) on October 20 , after entering the eastern Gulf of Mexico and turning towards the north . It curved northeastward and made landfall at Cedar Key , Florida . After pushing inland , the storm stalled and weakened to a tropical depression on October 21 before dissipating fully the next day . 
 The storm 's slow forward motion over the state of Florida led to heavy widespread precipitation , locally amounting to 35 in ( 890 mm ) in Trenton , Florida between October 17 and October 22 . Gale @-@ force winds were also reported . Some flood damage occurred throughout the affected locations . An infant was killed following the destruction of a house , possibly related to a tornado spawned by the tropical storm ; the baby 's parents also sustained injuries .

 " Extraordinary Merry Christmas " is the ninth episode and mid @-@ season finale of the third season of the American musical television series Glee , and the fifty @-@ third overall . Written by Marti Noxon and directed by Matthew Morrison , the episode aired on Fox in the United States on December 13 , 2011 , and features the members of New Directions starring in a black @-@ and @-@ white Christmas television special that is presented within the episode itself . 
 Nine songs are performed over the course of the episode , eight of which come from the second Glee Christmas soundtrack album , Glee : The Music , The Christmas Album Volume 2 . The episode has the same name as an original song on that album , " Extraordinary Merry Christmas " , which was written for Glee by the show 's executive music producer Adam Anders , song producer Peer Åström , and Shelly Peiken . The remaining eight songs are covers , and all nine were released as singles . Reviewers generally praised the music in the episode . 
 Although reviewers were polarized in their views of the episode as a whole , the special within the episode received mostly favorable comments , though the rest of the episode was deemed light on plot . Some aspects of the framing sequences were criticized , such as Rachel 's excessive demands for Christmas presents despite the fact that she is Jewish . Upon its initial airing , this episode was viewed by 7 @.@ 13 million American viewers and garnered a 3 @.@ 0 / 8 Nielsen rating / share in the 18 – 49 demographic . The total viewership was up marginally from the previous episode , " Hold On to Sixteen " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Sue ( Jane Lynch ) recruits the glee club to sing at a homeless shelter where she will be volunteering to distract her from the first Christmas without her sister Jean , who died earlier in the year . Finn ( Cory Monteith ) tells Rachel ( Lea Michele ) that all he wants for Christmas is her . Rachel ( Lea Michele ) replies that he is also all she wants , but gives Finn ( Cory Monteith ) a long list of Christmas present suggestions . Her dialogue , " All I want is what I have coming to me . All I want is my fair share " is a verbatim homage to Sally 's Christmas list scene with Charlie Brown in the Christmas classic , A Charlie Brown Christmas . Just as Charlie Brown is with Sally , Finn is appalled by how much Rachel wants , though she assures him that five of the items are enough . When she later hints that an early gift would not be amiss , he surprises her with the donation of a sow in her name to needy Africans . Rachel is unhappy , reminds Finn that she is a vegan , and recommends that he stick to her list to avoid embarrassment , while pointedly mentioning earrings . 
 New Directions celebrates the holidays as Mercedes ( Amber Riley ) sings " All I Want For Christmas Is You " . Rory ( Damian McGinty ) dedicates the song " Blue Christmas " to his family ; this is his first Christmas away from them . Sam ( Chord Overstreet ) offers to take Rory home with him to show him a true American Christmas . Glee club director Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) announces that New Directions has been asked to create a holiday special for the local PBS station , with Artie ( Kevin McHale ) as director . The station manager agrees to Artie 's concept — a black @-@ and @-@ white homage to both Star Wars Holiday Special and the " Judy Garland Christmas Special " , to feature hosts Kurt ( Chris Colfer ) and Blaine ( Darren Criss ) welcoming their friends for suave banter and happy , cheerful songs . Rory will play Itchy the Holiday Elf and recite " Frosty the Snowman " . Sam points out that " Frosty " does not have a happy ending , and that a little sadness is also part of Christmas . Artie only wants to present the " merry " part and will be rewriting Frosty to fit , so Sam decides not to participate . Sue interrupts a rehearsal for the show to reconfirm that New Directions will be singing at the homeless shelter on Friday , but the special is also set for Friday . Artie asks to reschedule , but Sue says they are already expected and is adamant : it must be Friday night . The club members decide to do the broadcast , and Sue leaves in disgust . 
 Kurt and Blaine lead off the Glee Holiday Spectacular by performing " Let It Snow " , Rachel and Mercedes arrive and sing " My Favorite Things " with their hosts , Finn and Puck ( Mark Salling ) show up as not @-@ quite @-@ real Star Wars characters and perform " Santa Claus Is Coming to Town " , and " Christmas Wrapping " is sung by Brittany ( Heather Morris ) , with backup by Santana ( Naya Rivera ) , Tina ( Jenna Ushkowitz ) , Mike ( Harry Shum , Jr . ) and several Cheerios . When Rory as Itchy arrives , the others are dismayed when he says he will not be reading " Frosty the Snowman " ; he instead reads the biblical nativity story from the Gospel according to Luke . 
 Quinn ( Dianna Agron ) and Sam are at the homeless shelter with Sue , helping to serve the rapidly disappearing meal , when New Directions arrives , late , with more food and some presents . The glee club sings " Do They Know It 's Christmas ? " for the people there . Back at McKinley , Rachel has a change of heart and names Finn 's gift sow " Barbra " . Finn does give her the earrings she wanted , but she ultimately returns them and he returns the iPod she gave him : they donate the money to the Salvation Army kettle manned by Sam and Rory , and stay to help .

 The episode is the directorial debut of Glee star Matthew Morrison , who plays Will Schuester . He announced that he would be directing an episode " during an acoustic set and Q & A at LA 's Grammy Museum for their Spotlight series " in late September 2011 . He ultimately did not direct the eighth episode as originally planned , but this ninth one instead . 
 It is also the second annual Glee Christmas episode , with nine songs , eight of which come from the second annual Glee Christmas soundtrack album , Glee : The Music , The Christmas Album Volume 2 . The only song that was not included on the album is " My Favorite Things " from the musical The Sound of Music , which was released as a single — as were all the other songs from the episode — and features Michele , Riley , Colfer and Criss . Although Morrison stated in an interview that the episode would include ten songs , one of them , " Santa Baby " , sung by Rivera and previously released on the soundtrack , had to be cut " because the episode was running long " , though a video of it was made available online the week after the episode aired . A scene of Blaine giving a ring to Kurt , shown in promotional photos for the episode , was also cut , and it was reported the night the episode aired that this scene would " be included in the Season 3 DVD " . Instead , a YouTube video containing the scene was tweeted by Ryan Murphy on August 1 , 2012 . 
 The episode itself has the same name as an original song on that album , " Extraordinary Merry Christmas " , which was written for Glee by the show 's executive music producer Adam Anders , song producer Peer Åström , and Shelly Peiken , and is sung on the second Christmas soundtrack album by Michele and Criss , who also perform it in the episode . The episode also includes covers of eight songs , seven of which are from the soundtrack album : Mariah Carey 's " All I Want for Christmas Is You " performed by Riley , Elvis Presley 's " Blue Christmas " sung by McGinty , Joni Mitchell 's " River " performed by Michele , " Let It Snow " sung by Criss and Colfer , " Santa Claus Is Coming to Town " performed by Monteith and Salling — but not by Samuel Larsen , who sings the song with them on the album — in the Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band version , The Waitresses ' " Christmas Wrapping " sung by Morris , and the Band Aid fundraiser " Do They Know It 's Christmas ? " performed by New Directions . The filming of this last piece , shot on Thanksgiving eve , involved " lots of children " . All proceeds from the cast 's version of " Do They Know It 's Christmas ? " will go to the Band Aid Trust Charity . 
 In an interview with Jimmy Kimmel , Morrison revealed that the episode " features a Christmas special within the episode that 's a throwback and a tribute to the Star Wars Holiday Special and the Judy Garland Christmas Special " , which are " combined in a way " . Lucasfilm Ltd. gave permission for Glee to use the Star Wars character Chewbacca for the sequence ; the actor who currently plays Chewbacca was flown in for a day of filming , though " he doesn 't sing " in the episode . 
 The episode serves as the mid @-@ season finale . Before the third season started , co @-@ creator Brad Falchuk announced that it would be structured as two " mini @-@ seasons " that mimic school semesters , and this episode ends the fall semester . Filming began on November 10 , 2011 , while the eighth episode , " Hold on to Sixteen " was still shooting ; they continued in parallel through November 21 , 2011 , when episode eight completed filming . " Extraordinary Merry Christmas " completed filming on November 29 , 2011 . Recurring guest stars that appear in the episode are New Directions members Rory Flanagan ( McGinty ) and Sam Evans ( Overstreet ) .

 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Critics were polarized in their reactions to the episode , though most seemed to agree that it was , as The Washington Post 's Jen Chaney put it , " heavy on holiday music and exceedingly light on plot " . Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called it a " jumbled mess " and BuddyTV 's John Kubicek a " total mess " , though the latter also characterized it as " absurdly entertaining " . Kevin P. Sullivan of MTV said it was " one of the most confusing episodes of Glee ever " . TV Guide 's reviewing team of Denise Martin and Kate Stanhope described it as " oddly mesmerizing , hilarious and kinda weird , even for Glee " , and Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times wrote that " chipper and the sad were in perfect balance and the kitsch factor was high " . 
 Several reviewers approved of the black @-@ and @-@ white television special that took up half of the episode . Indeed , most of these would rather the episode had consisted entirely of the special : IGN 's Robert Canning regretted that " the good stuff " was bookended with " inconsequential and awkward real world stories " , and Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone " would have preferred " the whole episode to be the show @-@ within @-@ a @-@ show . The Atlantic 's Kevin Fallon called the middle segments " a love letter to the Judy Garland specials it honored " and said it was a " bold move " for a series with mainstream youth appeal , and Rae Votta of Billboard thought the " homage was a shining example of what Glee can do when given the leeway to be strange and different " , and was another who wished it could have run the entire episode . Kubicek , on the other hand , was left cold by the " utterly pointless and plotless Christmas special " , and Flandez called the acting during it " haphazard " . The Huffington Post 's Crystal Bell said it was " just as weird as it sounds " , but she , like Fallon , described the special as a " bold move " . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club pointed out that while it was a " pitch @-@ perfect parody " of the Judy Garland and Star Wars specials , the inherent problem is that the originals were " already pretty awful " , so that to be " an accurate parody , Glee has to be awful " . 
 Rachel 's characterization , especially her Christmas greed even though she is Jewish , was singled out for criticism in many reviews . VanDerWerff wrote that the episode " hinged around Rachel being really excited about what she was going to get for Christmas , even though she 's Jewish " , and her end @-@ of episode shout of " Happy Hanukah " a " last minute patch job " to " stay true to the characters as they were at one time " . Sullivan also discussed her characterization and noted that she was " a character who makes a point of her Jewish heritage often " . He added , " she was basically horrible and played against character the entire episode , so she could eventually realize that she was awful and change her ways . " Bell criticized Rachel 's list of gifts , such as " spray tan and teeth whitening " , as " back to square one " after her nose @-@ job storyline in the second season . Finn 's contribution of a charity pig in Jewish Rachel 's honor was deemed " wrong on at least two levels " by Chaney . 
 A few reviewers were pleased by the new friendship between Rory and Sam . Kubicek said it was " officially my favorite thing from the entire third season of Glee " , and Bell approved , though she said " the writers don 't know how to use " Rory , and was disappointed that his brotherly relationship with Finn had " fizzled " . VanDerWerff singled out Rory 's reading from the bible , which was , as Canning phrased it , " ripped from A Charlie Brown Christmas " when Linus reads the same passage , as one that " irks " him most , " because it takes a perfectly beautiful little moment from a nearly perfect TV special " and makes it a " cutaway gag " . 
 Sue 's sudden change of behavior in this episode caused Kubicek to ask when she had become " the moral compass on this show " , and Bell wondered , " how does Ryan Murphy expect us to like a character that continually changes " , given that whenever she seems to go " in a new direction , she heads back to her same glee club @-@ hating ways " . Kubicek also made that point that while " Sam and Quinn seemingly did the right thing by choosing the shelter over the special " , the others did eventually show up , which " muddled " the message . 
 = = = Music and performances = = = 
 The reviewers generally praised the music in the episode . Votta wrote that " musically this episode was one of the season 's overall strongest " , though Flandez made reference to the " humdrum holiday songs " . Sullivan pointed out that it was " about the songs and only the songs " , and Kubicek felt it was a " blatant " attempt to sell Christmas albums . Chaney noted that the opening number , " All I Want for Christmas Is You " , " sounded much more vibrant and fresh with Mercedes " on lead , Futterman called it " utterly joyful " , and it was the favorite song of the episode for Martin and Stanhope . Votta declared that " Amber Riley shines throughout the episode , but none more than here where she commands attention " , and Sullivan called it a " nice rendition " that was nevertheless presented with " some incredibly awkward cuts from the original song " . 
 Entertainment Weekly 's Abby West wrote that " Rory 's crooning take " of " Blue Christmas " was " smooth and lovely " , and gave it a " B + " , and Flandez agreed with the in @-@ show assessment that it was " mournfully beautiful " . Futterman said that the song " perfectly suits his vocals " , but was unimpressed with Rory " standing awkwardly " through the song ; Michael Slezak of TVLine noted the static staging and filming of the number and gave it a " C " , and while Chaney said he sang it " just fine " , she said he " didn 't sell it " , and gave it a " C + " . Rachel 's rendition of " River " also received divergent assessments . Chaney and Slezak both gave it an " A − " : the former remarked that she " knows how to make the emotion in a song soar " , and the latter said " damn if she didn 't sound amazing " , though he pointed out the incongruity of Rachel having just stated after Rory 's song that uptempo and jolly is the way to go , only to sing this song , which is anything but . VanDerWerff agreed that there was " no good reason for Rachel to sing it " , and Flandez called it a " forgettable version " . Futterman 's conclusion was that " it feels a little phoned in and doesn 't emotionally connect " . 
 The original song for which the episode is named , " Extraordinary Merry Christmas " , received mostly decent marks from reviewers : Slezak gave it a " B " and called it " fun but slight " , and Sullivan said it was " okay , which is high praise for a " Glee " original " . Bell noted that " Blaine and Rachel sound great together " , and Martin and Stanhope also praised their " spirited performances " , though they said the song sounded " very generic " . Kubicek was harsher , and wrote that it was an " embarrassingly awful original song " , but while Votta characterized it as " a weird techno jumble " , she also called it " undeniably catchy " . 
 The opening number of the black @-@ and @-@ white " special " , " Let It Snow " featuring Blaine and Kurt , garnered the most praise . Slezak gave it an " A " and described it as a " jazzy , uptempo take on the seasonal classic with gorgeous harmonies and retro dancing " , and said it rivaled their Christmas duet from 2010 , " Baby , It 's Cold Outside " . While Vicki Hyman of The Star @-@ Ledger enjoyed the number , she preferred the previous year 's offering ; Flandez called " Let It Snow " an " admirable job " . Futterman characterized it as " both effortless and full of seasonal spirit " , and Votta said it was " a spot @-@ on tribute to male duets of yesteryear with that knowing undercurrent of romance even when it 's not explicit " . Chaney gave it an " A " , but she wondered at the inclusion of the next song , " My Favorite Things " , since it " technically isn 't a holiday song " . The number was also not as well received as many of the others : Bell described it as taking " a turn for the worse " , Hyman noted that it " didn 't do too much for me " , and Kubicek said it " seemed to drag on and on and on with no real purpose " . However , West called it a " wonderful effort " and Slezak wrote that " a little Rodgers and Hammerstein is always welcome at any party " ; both reviewers gave the performance a " B + " . 
 Finn and Puck 's rendition of " Santa Claus Is Coming to Town " was received tepidly . Votta referred to it as " mildly rocking " , and Slezak and Chaney both gave it a " B − " : the former said it was " fun " but " not deeply exciting " and the latter called it " competent " but " unmemorable " . Martin and Stanhope wrote that it " still packs a cheesy and powerful Christmas punch " ; it was their third favorite number . Their second favorite was the next number , " Christmas Wrapping " , sung by Brittany , which Flandez described as " quite good " and Hyman said " could only have been improved by a little more Mike Chang dancing " . VanDerWerff credited Morris with being " a gifted mimic when singing " though he called the performance " listless " , and Slezak , who gave the song an " A − " , wrote " I was just bummed that the song got cut short before my favorite line : ' A & P has provided me with the world 's smallest turkey . ' " 
 A number of reviewers had a problem with " Do They Know It 's Christmas ? " being set in a homeless shelter ; both Hyman and West called it an " odd choice " , and Slezak said he " struggled " with the location . Chaney called the lyrics " condescending " , and found the juxtaposition of the singers ' smiling faces and the phrase " clanging chimes of doom " to be " weird " . The song itself was given good marks : Hyman called it the episode 's " best performance " because " they each brought something special to it " , and Futterman said that New Directions " channels the emotion of the original for a fitting vocal cap to the night " . Both Slezak and West gave it a " B + " , and the former declared that " they sang the <unk> out of it " .

 = Prehistoric Orkney = 
 Prehistoric Orkney refers to a period in the human occupation of the Orkney archipelago of Scotland that was the latter part of these islands ' prehistory . The period of prehistory prior to occupation by the genus Homo is part of the geology of Scotland . Although some written records refer to Orkney during the Roman invasions of Scotland , prehistory in northern Scotland does not end until the commencement of the Early Historic Period around AD 600 . 
 There are numerous important prehistoric remains in Orkney , especially from the Neolithic period , four of which form a World Heritage Site . There are diverse reasons for the abundance of the archaeological record . The sandstone bedrock provides easily workable stone materials and the wind @-@ blown sands have helped preserve several sites . The relative lack of industrialisation and low incidence of ploughing also have helped to preserve these ancient monuments . Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures ( perhaps inherited from the Norse period of occupation ) that may have helped to retain their structural integrity . 
 Prehistory is conventionally divided into a number of shorter periods but differentiating these various eras of human history is a complex task – their boundaries are uncertain and the changes between them are gradual . The Paleolithic lasted until the retreat of the ice , the Mesolithic until the adoption of farming and the Neolithic until metalworking commenced . A number of the sites span long periods of time and in particular the distinctions between the Neolithic and the later periods are not clear cut . The extraordinary wealth of structures from the Neolithic is not matched either by the early periods , for which the evidence of human occupation is sparse or non @-@ existent , or the later Bronze Age which provides a relative dearth of evidence . The subsequent Iron Age supported a return to monumental building , especially of brochs . 
 Formal excavations were first recorded in the late 18th century and as they proceeded an understanding of the structures involved progressed from little more than folklore to modern archaeological science . The sites discussed are found on the Orkney Mainland unless otherwise stated . 
 = = Paleolithic = = 
 No traces have yet been found in Scotland of either a Neanderthal presence or of Homo sapiens during the Pleistocene interglacials . The first indications of humans occur only after the ice retreated in the 11th millennium BC and the current Flandrian interglacial began . Since that time the landscape of Orkney has been altered by both human and natural forces . Initially , sea levels were lower than at present due to the large volume of ice that remained . This meant that the Orkney islands may have been attached to the mainland , as was the present @-@ day island of Great Britain to Continental Europe . Much of the North Sea basin was also dry land until after 4000 BC . This would have made travel to northern Scotland relatively easy for early human settlers . The subsequent isostatic rise of land makes estimating post @-@ glacial coastlines a complex task . 
 = = Mesolithic = = 
 The very limited archaeological record provides scant evidence of Mesolithic life in Orkney in particular and Scotland north of Inverness in general . " Lithic scatter " sites at <unk> , South <unk> , <unk> Hill , <unk> and Loch of Stenness have produced small polished stone tools and chippings . A charred hazelnut shell , recovered during the excavations at <unk> in Tankerness in 2007 , has been dated to <unk> @-@ 6660 BC . However , there is no evidence to suggest whether or not these sites were in year @-@ round occupation and no Mesolithic burial sites have been uncovered anywhere in Scotland to date . 
 A recently excavated site on Stronsay has produced a thousand pieces of flint and what may be evidence of a temporary camp . With a tentative dating of 7000 BC or older it may prove to be the oldest settlement site found so far on Orkney . 
 About 6000 BC the Storegga Slides of the coast of Norway created a tsunami that reached 25 metres ( 82 ft ) above normal high tides in places . Evidence of widespread coastal inundations from a wave 8 metres ( 26 ft ) high has been found as far south as Fife and the impact on shore @-@ dwelling mesolithic societies in Orkney would have been considerable . 
 = = Neolithic = = 
 The assemblage of monumental Neolithic structures in Orkney is without parallel in the United Kingdom and on the Orkney Mainland provides an entire landscape of features from this period . During this time , complex new societies came to the fore that were a radical departure from the earlier hunter @-@ gatherers and which were capable of creating substantial structures . The Neolithic in Scotland lasted from approximately 4000 to 2200 BC and Orkney as a whole has nearly 3 @,@ 000 identified Neolithic sites all told . British archaeologists have often interpreted this era as having two distinct phases ; the Earlier Neolithic dominated by regional styles of pottery and architecture followed by a relatively abrupt change into the Later Neolithic characterised by new traditions found throughout the British Isles that incorporate structures on a grander scale . In the Orcadian context , there are definite developments during the Neolithic , but the changes are gradual and tend to build on earlier ideas rather than appearing to form two distinct periods . 
 The great Orcadian Neolithic monuments were constructed contemporaneously with the emergence of the Ancient Egyptian culture , more than 500 years before the building of the Great Pyramid of Giza and almost a millennium before the sarsen stones of Stonehenge were erected . At one time it was believed that this flowering of culture was essentially peripheral and that its origins were to be found to the south on mainland Great Britain . However , recently discovered evidence shows that Orkney was the starting place for much of the megalithic culture , including styles of architecture and pottery , that developed much later in the southern British Isles . 
 = = = Early dwellings and chambered cairns = = = 
 Knap of Howar Neolithic farmstead is probably the oldest preserved house in northern Europe . Situated on the island of Papa Westray ( which may have been combined with nearby Westray in the early Neolithic ) , the farmstead consists of two adjacent rounded rectangular thick @-@ walled buildings with low doorways linked by a passageway . This structure was inhabited for 900 years from 3700 BC but was evidently built on the site of an even older settlement . Unstan ware pottery pieces were found on the site , which was only discovered in the 1920s when this part of the coastline was exposed by gales and tides . 
 The Barnhouse Settlement is a cluster of at least fifteen buildings , including one that may have been used for communal gatherings , occupied between 3200 @-@ <unk> BC . The design of the houses , which were built above ground level , includes a central hearth , recessed box beds and stone dressers . There is a network of stone drains leading to a common ditch . Pottery of the grooved ware type , flints and stone tools have been found , as well as three flakes of <unk> thought to have come from the Isle of Arran . 
 Skara Brae consists of ten clustered houses and is northern Europe 's most complete Neolithic village . Occupied between 3100 – 2500 the houses are similar to those at Barnhouse , but they are linked by common passages and were built into a large midden containing ash , bones , shells , stone and organic waste . Only the roofs , which were probably supported by timber or whalebone , would have been visible from the outside . In each case the stone dressers were erected so that they dominated the view on entering the house through the low doors and there are elaborate carvings of unknown meaning on some of the stones in the houses and passages . A variety of bone beads , pins and pendants and four carved stone balls were also discovered at the site , which was only revealed after a storm in the winter of 1850 ripped away the grass from a covering sand dune . The existing ruins mostly belong to a secondary phase of building with the foundations of the first phase largely hidden from view . 
 There are two main types of chambered cairn on these islands : the Orkney / Cromarty type with a burial chamber approached through a low passage and usually divided into " stalls " by upright stone slabs , and the Maeshowe type ( see below ) , which is a later development with a cruciform layout and an elongated passage . 
 The island of Rousay has a substantial number of prehistoric sites ( see also below ) , including fifteen of such tombs , resulting it becoming known as the " Egypt of the north " . Midhowe Chambered Cairn on the western shore of the island is the finest example . The exterior walls of this large stone burial mound survive to well over head @-@ height and the constituent stones are arranged in a herring bone pattern . The original interior chambers were simple in style and dived into two or three stalls , but were later enlarged to include twelve separate compartments set along a 23 metres ( 75 ft ) passageway . There are other substantial tombs at <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> . Enlargement and elaboration of burial cairns as the Neolithic progressed is a theme found throughout Scotland , and the move from simple and private tombs to larger structures , some with entrances apparently designed for public gatherings may also be linked to the emergence of landscape @-@ scale ceremonial complexes . Other chambered tombs of significance include those at Unstan and <unk> on the Mainland and Holm of Papa Westray . 
 Links of Noltland , a site on the north coast of the island of Westray has been excavated since the 1980s . In 2009 a lozenge @-@ shaped figurine was discovered , which may have been carved 2500 @-@ 3000 BC and is believed to be the earliest representation of a human face ever found in Scotland . The face has two dots for eyes , heavy brows and an oblong nose and a pattern of hatches on the body could represent clothing . Archaeologist Richard Strachan described it as a find of " astonishing rarity " . 
 = = = The Heart of Neolithic Orkney = = = 
 Skara Brae , Maeshowe , the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness together form the Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO World Heritage Site in the western part of the Orkney Mainland and which was inscribed in 1999 . This small area has provided a rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe . However , it would be a mistake to imagine that because Orkney is so placed today that this was always so . There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a variety of the smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain . It is also clear that whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in Britain has often been from the south to the north , that at this time , it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture . 
 There is also the possibility that tribal differences were part of the Neolithic cultural landscape . Unstan Ware pottery is associated with small settlements like Knap of Howar , and stalled tombs such as Midhowe . Grooved Ware pottery on the other hand tends to be associated with larger ' village ' settlements like Skara Brae and Barnhouse , and with Maes Howe style tombs . 
 = = = = Maeshowe = = = = 
 Dating from about 3000 BC , Maeshowe is a large chambered cairn and passage grave . " Howe " as an element in a name , from the Old Norse word <unk> meaning mound or barrow , is common throughout Orkney . The grass mound hides a complex of passages and chambers built of carefully crafted slabs of sandstone that in scale and accomplishment has few equals in prehistoric Europe . It is aligned so that the rear wall of its central chamber , a rough cube of 4 @.@ 5 cubic metres ( 5 @.@ 9 cu yd ) is illuminated on the winter solstice . It gives its name to the Maeshowe type of chambered cairns , ( see above ) that include other significant sites such as <unk> Hill , Quanterness and <unk> Hill , and at Quoyness on Sanday . 
 After it fell into disuse during the Bronze Age , Maeshowe was re @-@ opened and used centuries later by Vikings from about the 9th to the 12th centuries AD . The Norsemen left a series of runic inscriptions on the stone walls of the chamber , some of which were left by a group of crusaders in the winter of 1153 – 54 . Over thirty individual inscriptions remain , one of the largest such collections in Europe . 
 = = = = Ring of Brodgar = = = = 
 The Ring of Brodgar is a henge and stone circle 104 metres ( 341 ft ) in diameter , originally made of 60 stones ( of which only 27 remain standing ) set within a circular ditch up to 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) deep and 10 metres ( 33 ft ) wide . Some of the remaining stones are 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) high and it has been estimated that the ditch alone took 80 @,@ 000 man @-@ hours to construct . The ring stands on a small isthmus between the Lochs of Stenness and Harray and it is generally thought to have been erected between 2500 BC and 2000 BC . 
 Excavations by Orkney College at the nearby Ness of Brodgar site between the Ring and the Stones of Stenness have revealed several buildings , both ritual and domestic and the works suggest there are likely to be more in the vicinity . One structure appears to be 20 metres ( 66 ft ) long by 11 metres ( 36 ft ) wide . Pottery , bones , stone tools and polished stone mace heads have also been discovered . Perhaps the most important find is the remains of a large stone wall which may have been 100 metres ( 330 ft ) long and 4 metres ( 13 ft ) or more wide . It appears to traverse the entire peninsula the site is on and may have been a symbolic barrier between the ritual landscape of the Ring and the mundane world around it . 
 In 2010 a rock coloured red , orange and yellow was unearthed . Although containers of pigments have been found previously at sites such as Skara Brae , this was the first discovery in Britain , and possibly in Northern Europe , of evidence that Neolithic peoples used paint to decorate their buildings . It is thought that the primitive paint could have been made from iron ore , mixed with animal fat , milk or eggs . Only a week later a stone with a zigzag chevron pattern painted with a red pigment was discovered nearby . 
 = = = = Stones of Stenness = = = = 
 The Stones of Stenness are five remaining megaliths of a henge , the largest of which is 6 metres ( 20 ft ) high . The site is thought to date from 3100 BC , one of the earliest dates for a henge anywhere in Britain . The Stones are part of a landscape that evidently had considerable ritual significance for the " Grooved ware people " . The Ring of Brodgar lies about 1 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) to the north @-@ west , and Maeshowe is a similar distance to the east . Barnhouse is only 150 metres ( 490 ft ) to the north . 
 The existing megaliths were originally part of an elliptical shaped stone circle of 12 stones , about 32 metres ( 105 ft ) in diameter surrounded by a ditch that was 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) wide and 7 metres ( 23 ft ) deep and with a single entrance causeway on the north side that faces towards the Barnhouse Settlement . The Watch Stone stands outside the circle to the north @-@ west and is 5 @.@ 6 metres ( 18 ft ) high . Other smaller stones include a square stone like a huge hearth setting in the centre of the circle and this along with the bones of cattle , sheep , wolves and dogs found in the ditch suggest ritual sacrifice and feasting . 
 Even in the 18th century the site was still associated with traditions and rituals , by then relating to Norse gods . The " Odin Stone " was pierced with a circular hole , and was used by local couples for <unk> engagements by holding hands through the gap . In the early 19th century a local landowner and recent immigrant to Orkney decided to remove the Stones on the grounds that local people were trespassing and disturbing his land in using the stones . He started in December 1814 by smashing the Odin Stone . This caused outrage and he was stopped after destroying one other stone and toppling another . The toppled stone was re @-@ erected in 1906 along with some inaccurate reconstruction inside the circle . 
 = = = Other Late Neolithic sites = = = 
 The Isbister Chambered Cairn , popularly known as the " Tomb of the Eagles " is located on the cliffs of South Ronaldsay . This chambered tomb was in use for 800 years or more from 3150 BC , and has five separate stalls and three side @-@ chambers . 16 @,@ 000 human bones were found during the excavations , as well as 725 bird bones , predominantly white @-@ tailed sea eagle and over 25 kilograms ( 55 lb ) of pottery shards . 
 The <unk> Stane tomb on the island of Hoy is made from a single huge block of red sandstone with a hollowed @-@ out central chamber . This style is quite unlike any other Neolithic Orkney site and probably dates from about 2500 BC . It was the first Orcadian ancient monument to be described in writing , appearing in the 16th century Descriptio Insularum <unk> by <unk> Ben who provided the explanation for its existence as having been built and used by giants . 
 = = Bronze Age = = 
 The Bronze Age in Scotland lasted from approximately 2200 BC to 800 BC and northern Scotland has produced a relative dearth of remains from this period in comparison to the Neolithic and later Iron Age . This may in part be due to deteriorating weather conditions in the second millennium BC . In Orkney , fewer large stone structures were built during this period , burials were now being made in small cists well away from the great megalithic sites and a new Beaker culture began to dominate . Nonetheless the great ceremonial circles continued in use as bronze metalworking was slowly introduced to Scotland from Europe over a lengthy period . There is agreement amongst historians that from about 1000 BC it is legitimate to talk of a Celtic culture in Scotland , although the nature of the Orcadian Celtic civilisation and their relationships to their neighbours remains largely unknown . 
 In addition to various Mainland sites such as <unk> of <unk> , <unk> Hill and the impressive <unk> Mound near the Ring of Brodgar there are various Bronze Age structures on other islands such as Tofts Ness on Sanday , Warness on Eday , the remains of two houses on Holm of Faray , and a burnt mound and farmstead on <unk> . 
 = = Iron Age = = 
 = = = Early Iron Age = = = 
 The Iron Age provides numerous substantial building remains . In the 1970s excavations at Quanterness , near the site of the Neolithic chambered tomb , revealed an Atlantic roundhouse . This was built about 700 BC using stone stripped from the older building that had fallen into disuse some two millennia previously . 
 Numerous similar finds have been made at for example , Bu on the Mainland and Pierowall Quarry on Westray . These are also many impressive broch sites . These are substantial stone towers that developed out of the roundhouse tradition in north and west Scotland , whose dry @-@ stone walls may have reached 13 metres ( 43 ft ) in height . Although Orkney has no broch towers where the surviving walls are more than a few metres high , several important sites have been excavated which have numerous associated buildings forming a " broch village " . 
 Midhowe Broch lies close to the chambered cairn of the same name on Rousay . There appear to have been at least two separate periods of occupation and at some point buttresses were added to the exterior of the wall , suggesting the structure was in need of support . It is one of 11 broch sites on either side of the Eynhallow Sound . Burroughston Broch on the island of Shapinsay was built in the second half of the first millennium BC and excavated in the mid 19th century . Its earth cladding is intact , allowing visitors to peer down into the broch from above . The walls are up to 4 metres ( 13 ft ) thick in places and there is a complete chamber off the entrance passage . The remains of stone furniture are evident in the interior . 
 Mine Howe , located near Tankerness in the parish of St Andrews , is a prehistoric subterranean man @-@ made chamber dug 7 metres ( 23 ft ) deep inside a large mound . Its purpose is not obvious . The walls are lined with stones fitted to form an arch over the cavity and steep steps lead to a rock floor . The entrance is at the top of the small hill and there is a surrounding ditch and evidence of sophisticated metal working around the site . The <unk> Earth House is a souterrain consisting of an oval chamber with a corbelled roof supported by pillars . Although these structures are usually associated with the storage of food this site is reminiscent of the Neolithic chambered tombs and excavations revealed 18 human skeletons . 
 <unk> are stone buildings from the later Iron Age whose characteristic features include an outer wall within which a circle of stone piers ( bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel ) form the basis for lintel arches supporting corbelled roofing with a hearth at the hub . Eight presumed sites have been identified in Orkney although the style is different from those of Shetland and the Western Isles . The Orkney sites are four on Sanday , one on Calf of Eday , one at Hillock of Burroughston on Shapinsay and two on the Mainland at <unk> Broch and Broch of Gurness . 
 = = = The influence of Rome = = = 
 For a brief period Orkney emerged from prehistory and into <unk> . The Greek explorer Pytheas visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC and may have circumnavigated the mainland . In his On the Ocean he refers to the most northerly point as Orcas , conceivably a reference to Orkney . 
 Remarkably , the earliest written record of a formal connection between Rome and Scotland is the attendance of the " King of Orkney " who was one of eleven British kings who submitted to the Emperor Claudius at Colchester in AD 43 following the invasion of southern Britain three months earlier . The long distances and short period of time involved strongly suggest a prior connection between Rome and Orkney , although no evidence of this has been found and the contrast with later Caledonian resistance to Rome is striking . Pomponius Mela , the Roman geographer , recorded in his De <unk> , written c . 43 AD , that there were thirty Orkney islands . There is certainly evidence of an Orcadian connection with Rome prior to AD 60 from pottery found at the Broch of Gurness and 1st and 2nd century Roman coins have been found at <unk> broch . 
 The Roman presence in Scotland was however little more than a series of relatively brief interludes of partial military occupation . As Roman influence waned in Scotland from 211 onwards , Orkney faded from history again and the Celtic Iron Age way of life continued , largely unchanged . 
 = = = Pictish rule = = = 
 In the centuries following Rome 's excursions into Scottish territory Orkney was , at least for a time , part of the Pictish kingdom . Very little is known about the Pictish Orcadians , the main archaeological relics being symbol stones . One of the best examples is located on the Brough of Birsay ; it shows 3 warriors with spears and sword scabbards combined with traditional Pictish symbols . This small tidal island has a long history of settlement that continued into the Norse period . 
 Adomnan , the biographer of St Columba , states that there were Orcadians at the court of the Pictish High King , Bridei , in AD 565 . These Orcadians were described as " hostages " which could imply difficult relations between Orkney and the king , although they may have simply been guests at the court . A Pictish cemetery was found in the grounds of Skaill House ( adjacent to Skara Brae ) in 1996 . 
 Christianity probably arrived in Orkney in the 6th century and organised church authority emerged in the 8th century . The Buckquoy spindle @-@ whorl found at a Pictish site on Birsay is an Ogham – inscribed artefact whose interpretation has caused controversy although it is now generally considered to be of both Irish and Christian origin . Evidence associated with the St Boniface Church on Papa Westray suggests this island had been the seat of the Christian bishopric of Orkney in Pictish times . The 8th century was also the time the Viking invasions of the Scottish seaboard commenced and with them came the arrival of a new culture and language for the Orkney islands . The Norse era has provided a variety of written records , the substantial Orkneyinga Saga amongst them and at this point the archipelago fully emerges into the historic era . 
 = = Archaeological history = = 
 Formal excavations are first recorded at Earl 's Knoll on Papa Stronsay in the Statistical Account of Scotland in 1795 . As with the <unk> Stane , the mound was assumed to be a giant 's grave at the time . Following soon after this , work on the " Picts @-@ house " ( i.e. chambered tomb ) at Quanterness commenced , but little else of note was achieved until the mid 19th century . F. W. L. Thomas , whose day job was as a Captain in the Royal Navy published The Celtic Antiquities of Orkney in 1852 , which listed various sites and aimed to interest " antiquarians " in the subject . His hopes were met and about a dozen chambered tombs were worked on between 1849 and 1867 by James Farrer , R.J. Hebden and George Petrie . However , other than work at Unstan near Stromness there was then a lull for about six decades . Then , from the late 1920s , work recommenced with the assistance of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland and the Ministry of Works . The most eminent archaeologist to work here at this time was Vere Gordon Childe . He was involved in excavations at Skara Brae and <unk> , but it was only when a shard of pottery was discovered at the latter site that it became understood that these settlements dated to the Neolithic rather than the Iron Age . A further 18 tombs were excavated before 1950 , including five on Eday and one on the Calf of Eday and by the 1960s the outlines of a modern understanding of Orcadian prehistory had emerged . The advent of radiocarbon dating enabled even more detailed dates to be established and refuted earlier theories that the chambered tombs of Orkney had developed from similar structures found in the Eastern Mediterranean , such as those built by the Minoans , when it became clear that the former pre @-@ dated the latter by a considerable margin .

 = Albany , New York = 
 Albany ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ bə @-@ nee ) is the capital of the U.S. state of New York and the seat of Albany County . Roughly 150 miles ( 240 km ) north of New York City , Albany developed on the west bank of the Hudson River , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of its confluence with the Mohawk River . The population of the City of Albany was 97 @,@ 856 according to the 2010 census . Albany constitutes the economic and cultural core of the Capital District of New York State , which comprises the Albany @-@ Schenectady @-@ Troy , NY Metropolitan Statistical Area , including the nearby cities and suburbs of Troy , Schenectady , and Saratoga Springs . With a Census @-@ estimated population of 1 @,@ 170 @,@ 483 in 2013 , the Capital District is the third most populous metropolitan region in the state and 38th in the United States . 
 Fortune 500 companies that have headquarters in Albany include American Express , <unk> , Merrill Lynch , General Electric , Verizon , Goldman Sachs , International Paper , Key Bank , f.y.e. stores , and the Environment One Corporation . In the 21st century , the Capital District has emerged as a major anchor of Tech Valley , the moniker describing the technologically @-@ focused region of eastern New York State . 
 This was the first European settlement in the state , settled by Dutch colonists who built Fort Nassau for fur trading in 1614 and Fort Orange in 1624 . They formed successful relations with both the Mahican and the Mohawk peoples , two major Native American nations in the region . The fur trade attracted settlers who founded a village called Beverwijck near Fort Orange . In 1664 the English took over the Dutch settlements , renaming the city as Albany , in honor of the then Duke of Albany , the future James II of England and James VII of Scotland . The city was officially chartered in 1686 under English rule . It became the capital of New York State in 1797 , following the United States gaining independence in the American Revolutionary War . Albany is one of the oldest surviving settlements of the original British thirteen colonies , and the longest continuously chartered city in the United States . Its charter is possibly the longest @-@ running instrument of municipal government in the Western Hemisphere . 
 During the late 18th century and throughout most of the 19th , Albany was a center of trade and transportation . It is located on the north end of the navigable Hudson River , was the original eastern terminus of the Erie Canal connecting to the Great Lakes , and was home to some of the earliest railroad systems in the world . Albany 's main exports at the time were beer , lumber , published works , and ironworks . Beginning in 1810 , Albany was one of the ten most populous cities in the United States , a distinction that it held until the 1860 census . 
 Albany is one of the first cities in the world to have installed public water mains , sewer lines , natural gas lines and electricity , infrastructure and utilities that attracted and supported substantial new industry to the city and surrounding area during the 19th century . 
 In the 20th century , the city opened one of the first commercial airports in the world , the precursor of today 's Albany International Airport . During the 1920s a powerful political machine controlled by the Democratic Party arose in the state capital , connected to politics in New York City as well . It marshalled the power of immigrants and their descendants in both cities . 
 The city 's skyline changed in the 1940s and 1950s with the construction of office towers around the Empire State Plaza and at the uptown campus of SUNY Albany , mainly under the direction of Governor Nelson Rockefeller . While Albany experienced a decline in its population due to urban sprawl and suburbanization , many of its historic neighborhoods were saved from destruction through the policies of Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd , the longest @-@ serving mayor of any city in the United States . In the early 21st century , Albany has experienced growth in the high @-@ technology industry , with great strides in the nanotechnology sector . 
 Albany has been a center of higher education for over a century , with much of the remainder of its economy dependent on state government and health care services . The city has rebounded from the urban decline of the 1970s and 1980s , with noticeable development taking place in the city 's downtown and midtown neighborhoods . Albany is known for its rich history , commerce , culture , architecture , and institutions of higher education . Albany won the All @-@ America City Award in both 1991 and 2009 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Colonial times to 1800 = = = 
 Albany is one of the oldest surviving European settlements from the original thirteen colonies and the longest continuously chartered city in the United States . The Hudson River area was originally inhabited by Algonquian @-@ speaking Mohican ( Mahican ) , who called it <unk> @-@ <unk> , meaning " the fireplace of the Mohican nation . " Based to the west along the Mohawk River , the Iroquoian @-@ speaking Mohawk referred to it as <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ ta @-@ da , or " through the pine woods , " referring to the path they took there . The Mohawk were one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy , or Haudenosaunee , and became strong trading partners with the Dutch and English . It is likely that the Albany area was visited by European fur traders , perhaps as early as 1540 , but the extent and duration of those visits has not been determined . 
 Permanent European claims began when Englishman Henry Hudson , exploring for the Dutch East India Company on the Half Moon ( Dutch : Halve Maen ) , reached the area in 1609 , claiming it for the United Netherlands . In 1614 , Hendrick <unk> built Fort Nassau , a fur @-@ trading post and the first documented European structure in present @-@ day Albany . Commencement of the fur trade provoked hostility from the French colony in Canada and among the natives , all of whom vied to control the trade . In 1618 , a flood ruined the fort on Castle Island , but it was rebuilt in 1624 as Fort Orange . Both forts were named in honor of the Dutch royal House of Orange @-@ Nassau . Fort Orange and the surrounding area were incorporated as the village of Beverwijck ( English : Beaver District ) in 1652 . In these early decades of trade , the Dutch , Mohican and Mohawk developed relations that reflected differences among their three cultures . 
 When New Netherland was captured by the English in 1664 , they changed the name Beverwijck to Albany , in honor of the Duke of Albany ( later James II of England and James VII of Scotland ) . Duke of Albany was a Scottish title given since 1398 , generally to a younger son of the King of Scots . The name is ultimately derived from Alba , the Gaelic name for Scotland . The Dutch briefly regained Albany in August 1673 and renamed the city <unk> ; the English took permanent possession with the Treaty of Westminster ( 1674 ) . On November 1 , 1683 , the Province of New York was split into counties , with Albany County being the largest . At that time the county included all of present New York State north of Dutchess and Ulster Counties in addition to present @-@ day Bennington County , Vermont , theoretically stretching west to the Pacific Ocean ; the city of Albany became the county seat . Albany was formally chartered as a municipality by provincial Governor Thomas Dongan on July 22 , 1686 . The Dongan Charter was virtually identical in content to the charter awarded to the city of New York three months earlier . Dongan created Albany as a strip of land 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) wide and 16 miles ( 26 km ) long . Over the years Albany would lose much of the land to the west and annex land to the north and south . At this point , Albany had a population of about 500 people . 
 In 1754 , representatives of seven British North American colonies met in the Stadt Huys , Albany 's city hall , for the Albany Congress ; Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania presented the Albany Plan of Union there , which was the first formal proposal to unite the colonies . Although it was never adopted by Parliament , it was an important precursor to the United States Constitution . The same year , the French and Indian War , the fourth in a series of wars dating back to 1689 , began ; it ended in 1763 with French defeat , resolving a situation that had been a constant threat to Albany and held back its growth . In 1775 , with the colonies in the midst of the Revolutionary War , the Stadt Huys became home to the Albany Committee of Correspondence ( the political arm of the local revolutionary movement ) , which took over operation of Albany 's government and eventually expanded its power to control all of Albany County . Tories and prisoners of war were often jailed in the Stadt Huys alongside common criminals . In 1776 , Albany native Philip Livingston signed the Declaration of Independence at Independence Hall in Philadelphia . 
 During and after the Revolutionary War , Albany County saw a great increase in real estate transactions . After Horatio Gates ' win over John Burgoyne at Saratoga in 1777 , the upper Hudson Valley was generally at peace as the war raged on elsewhere . Prosperity was soon seen all over Upstate New York . Migrants from Vermont and Connecticut began flowing in , noting the advantages of living on the Hudson and trading at Albany , while being only a few days ' sail from New York City . Albany reported a population of 3 @,@ 498 in the first national census in 1790 , an increase of almost 700 % since its chartering . In 1797 , the state capital of New York was moved permanently to Albany . From statehood to this date , the Legislature had frequently moved the state capital between Albany , Kingston , Hurley , Poughkeepsie , and the city of New York . Albany is the tenth @-@ oldest state capital in the United States , but only the second @-@ oldest state capital that is a city , after Santa Fe , New Mexico . 
 = = = 1800 to 1942 = = = 
 Albany has been a center of transportation for much of its history . In the late 18th and early 19th centuries , Albany saw development of the turnpike and by 1815 , Albany was the turnpike center of the state . Simeon De Witt developed a grid block system in 1794 , and renamed streets for birds and mammals that had previously honored British royalty . This grid was intersected by the major arterials coming out of Albany , which cut through the city at unexpected angles . The construction of the turnpike across the state , in conjunction with canal and railroad systems , made Albany the hub of transportation for pioneers going to Buffalo and the Michigan Territory in the early- and mid @-@ 19th century . 
 In 1807 , Robert Fulton initiated a steamboat line from New York to Albany , the first successful enterprise of its kind . By 1810 , with 10 @,@ 763 people , Albany was the 10th @-@ largest urban place in the nation . The town and village were known as " the Colonie " to the north of Albany was annexed in 1815 . In 1825 the Erie Canal was completed , forming a continuous water route from the Great Lakes to New York City . Unlike the current Barge Canal , which ends at nearby Waterford , the original Erie Canal ended at Albany ; Lock 1 was located north of Colonie Street . The Canal emptied into a 32 @-@ acre ( 13 ha ) man @-@ made lagoon called the Albany Basin , which was Albany 's main port from 1825 until the Port of Albany @-@ Rensselaer opened in 1932 . In 1829 , while working as a professor at the Albany Academy , Joseph Henry , widely regarded as " the foremost American scientist of the 19th century " , built the first electric motor . Three years later , he discovered electromagnetic self @-@ induction ( the SI unit for which is now the henry ) . He went on to be the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution . In the 1830 and 1840 censuses , Albany was ranked as the 9th @-@ largest urban place in the nation , then back to 10th in 1850 . This was the last time the city was one of the top ten largest urban places in the nation . 
 Albany also has significant history with rail transport , as the location of two major regional railroad headquarters . The Delaware and Hudson Railway was headquartered in Albany at what is now the SUNY System Administration Building . In 1853 , Erastus Corning , a noted industrialist and Albany 's mayor from 1834 to 1837 , consolidated ten railroads stretching from Albany to Buffalo into the New York Central Railroad ( <unk> ) , headquartered in Albany until Cornelius Vanderbilt moved it to New York City in 1867 . One of the ten companies that formed the <unk> was the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad , which was the first railroad in the state and the first successful steam railroad running regularly scheduled service in the country . 
 While the key to Albany 's economic prosperity in the 19th century was transportation , industry and business also played a role . Largely thanks to the city 's Dutch and German roots , beer was one of its biggest commodities . Beverwyck Brewery , originally known as Quinn and Nolan ( Nolan being mayor of Albany 1878 – 1883 ) , was the last remaining brewer from that time when it closed in 1972 . The city 's location at the east end of the Erie Canal gave it unparalleled access to both raw products and a captive customer base in the west . Albany was known for its publishing houses , and to some extent , still is . Albany was second only to Boston in the number of books produced for most of the 19th century . Iron foundries in both the north and south ends of the city brought thousands of immigrants to the city . To this day , one can see many intricate wrought @-@ iron details on older buildings . The iron industry waned by the 1890s due to increased costs associated with a newly unionized workforce and the opening of mines in the Mesabi Range in Minnesota . 
 Albany 's other major exports during the 18th and 19th centuries were furs , wheat , meat , and lumber ; by 1865 , there were almost 4 @,@ 000 saw mills in the Albany area and the Albany Lumber District was the largest lumber market in the nation . The city was also home to a number of banks . The Bank of Albany ( 1792 – 1861 ) was the second chartered bank in New York . The city was the original home of the <unk> ( founded in 1820 as the Albany Savings Bank ) , KeyBank ( founded in 1825 as the Commercial Bank of Albany ) , and Norstar Bank ( founded as the State Bank of Albany in 1803 ) . American Express was originally founded in Albany in 1850 as an express mail business . In 1871 , the northwestern portion of Albany — west from Magazine Street — was annexed to the neighboring town of Guilderland after the town of Watervliet refused annexation of said territory . In return for this loss , portions of Bethlehem and Watervliet were added to Albany . Part of the land annexed to Guilderland was ceded back to Albany in 1910 , setting up the current western border . 
 Albany opened one of the first commercial airports in the world , and the first municipal airport in the United States , in 1908 . Originally located on a polo field on Loudon Road , it moved to Westerlo Island in 1909 and remained there until 1928 . The Albany Municipal Airport — jointly owned by the city and county — was moved to its current location in Colonie in 1928 . In 1960 , the mayor sold the city 's stake in the airport to the county , citing budget issues . It was known from then on as Albany County Airport until a massive upgrade and modernization project between 1996 and 1998 , when it was rechristened Albany International Airport . By 1916 Albany 's northern and southern borders reached their modern courses ; Westerlo Island , to the south , became the second @-@ to @-@ last annexation , which occurred in 1926 .

 Erastus Corning 2nd , arguably Albany 's most notable mayor ( and great @-@ grandson of the former mayor of the same name ) , was elected in 1941 . Although he was one of the longest @-@ serving mayors of any city in United States history ( 1942 until his death in 1983 ) , one historian describes Corning 's tenure as " long on years , short on accomplishments . " <unk> cited Corning 's preference for maintaining the status quo as a factor that held back potential progress during his tenure . While Corning brought stability to the office of mayor , it is said that even those who admire him greatly cannot come up with a sizable list of " major concrete Corning achievements . " Corning is given credit for saving — albeit somewhat unintentionally — much of Albany 's historic architecture . 
 During the 1950s and 1960s , a time when federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful , Albany did not have growth in its economy or infrastructure . It lost more than 20 percent of its population during the Corning years , as people moved to newer housing in the suburbs , followed by most of the downtown businesses moving there as well . While cities across the country grappled with similar issues , the problems were magnified in Albany : interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably . 
 Governor Nelson Rockefeller ( 1959 – 1973 ) ( R ) tried to stimulate the city with grandiose , monumental architecture and large , government @-@ sponsored building projects ; he drove construction of the Empire State Plaza , SUNY Albany 's uptown campus , and much of the W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus . Albany County Republican Chairman Joseph C. <unk> once quipped , " Governor Rockefeller was the best mayor Albany ever had . " Corning , though opposed to the project , was responsible for negotiating the payment plan for the Empire State Plaza . Rockefeller did not want to be limited by the Legislature 's power of the purse , so Corning devised a plan to have the county pay for the construction and have the state sign a lease @-@ ownership agreement . The state paid off the bonds until 2004 . It was Rockefeller 's only viable option , and he agreed . Due to the clout Corning gained from the situation , he was able to get the State Museum , a convention center , and a restaurant , back in the plans — ideas which Rockefeller had originally vetoed . The county gained $ 35 million in fees and the city received $ 13 million for lost tax revenue . Having the state offices located in the city enabled it to keep good jobs . 
 Another major project of the 1960s and 1970s was Interstate 787 and the South Mall Arterial . Construction began in the early 1960s . One of the project 's main results , since regretted , was separating the city from the Hudson River , its source of development . Corning has been described as shortsighted with respect to use of the waterfront , as he could have used his influence to change the location of I @-@ 787 , which now cuts the city off from " its whole raison d 'être " . Much of the original plan never came to fruition , however : Rockefeller had wanted the South Mall Arterial to pass through the Empire State Plaza . The project would have required an underground trumpet interchange below Washington Park , connecting to the ( eventually cancelled ) Mid @-@ Crosstown Arterial . To this day , evidence of the original plan is still visible . In 1967 the hamlet of <unk> was the last annexation by the city , taken from the Town of Bethlehem . 
 When Corning died in 1983 , Thomas Whalen assumed the mayorship and was reelected twice . He encouraged redevelopment of historic structures and helped attract federal dollars earmarked for that purpose . What Corning had saved from destruction , Whalen refurbished for continued and new uses . The Mayor 's Office of Special Events was created in an effort to increase the number of festivals and artistic events in the city , including a year @-@ long Dongan Charter tricentennial celebration in 1986 . Whalen is credited for an " unparalleled cycle of commercial investment and development " in Albany due to his " aggressive business development programs " . 
 Prior to the recession of the 1990s , downtown Albany was home to four Fortune 500 companies . After the death of Corning and the retirement of Congressman Sam Stratton , the political environment changes . Long @-@ term office holders became rare in the 1980s . Local media began following the drama surrounding county politics ( specifically that of the newly created county executive position ) ; the loss of Corning ( and eventually the machine ) led to a lack of interest in city politics . The election of Gerald Jennings was a surprise , and he served as Mayor from 1994 until his retirement at the end of 2013 . His tenure essentially ended the political machine that had been in place since the 1920s . 
 During the 1990s , the State Legislature approved the $ 234 million " Albany Plan " , " a building and renovation project [ that ] was the most ambitious building project to affect the area since the Rockefeller era . " Under the Albany Plan , renovation and new building projects were initiated around the downtown area . Many state workers were relocated from the Harriman State Office Campus to downtown , helping its retail businesses and vitality . During the first decade of the 21st century , progress was made on a long @-@ discussed and controversial Albany Convention Center . As of August 2010 , the Albany Convention Center Authority ( authorized by the state legislature ) had already purchased 75 % of the land needed to build the downtown project . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Albany is located about 150 miles ( 240 km ) north of New York City on the Hudson River . It has a total area of 21 @.@ 8 square miles ( 56 km2 ) , of which 21 @.@ 4 square miles ( 55 km2 ) is land and 0 @.@ 4 square miles ( 1 @.@ 0 km2 ) ( 1 @.@ 8 % ) is water . The city is bordered on the north by the town of Colonie ( along with the village of Menands ) , on the west by the town of Guilderland , and on the south by the town of Bethlehem . The Hudson River represents the city 's eastern border . Patroon Creek , along the northern border , and the Normans Kill , along the southern border , are the two major streams in the city . The former Foxes Creek , Beaver Kill , and <unk> Kill still exist , but were diverted underground in the 19th century . There are four lakes within city limits : Buckingham Lake ; Rensselaer Lake at the mouth of the Patroon Creek ; Tivoli Lake , which was formed as a reservoir and once connected to the Patroon Creek ; and Washington Park Lake , which was formed by damming the Beaver Kill . 
 The highest natural point in Albany is a USGS benchmark near the Loudonville Reservoir off Birch Hill Road , at 378 feet ( 115 m ) above sea level . The lowest point is sea level at the Hudson River ( the average water elevation is 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) ) , which is still technically an estuary at Albany and is affected by the Atlantic tide . The interior of Albany consists of rolling hills which were once part of the Albany Pine Bush , an area of pitch pine and scrub oak , and has arid , sandy soil that is a remnant of the ancient Lake Albany . Due to development , the Pine Bush has shrunk from an original 25 @,@ 000 to 6 @,@ 000 acres ( 10 @,@ 100 to 2 @,@ 400 ha ) today . A preserve was set up by the State Legislature in 1988 and is located on the western edge of the city , spilling into Guilderland and Colonie ; it is the only sizable inland pine barrens sand dune ecosystem in the United States , and is home to many endangered species , including the Karner Blue butterfly . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Albany is located in the humid continental climate zone ( Köppen climate classification : Dfa ) , and has cold , snowy winters , and hot , wet summers ; the city experiences four distinct seasons . Albany is located in plant hardiness zone 6a near downtown and along the shore of the Hudson and 5b at its western end . Albany receives 39 @.@ 4 inches ( 1 @,@ 000 mm ) of rain per year , with 138 days of at least 0 @.@ 01 in ( 0 @.@ 25 mm ) of precipitation each year . Snowfall is significant , totaling 59 @.@ 1 inches ( 150 cm ) annually , but with less accumulation than the lake @-@ effect areas to the north and west , as it is further from Lake Ontario . However , Albany is close enough to the Atlantic coast to receive heavy snow from Nor 'easters and the city occasionally receives Alberta clippers . Winters can be very cold with fluctuating conditions ; temperatures drop to 0 ° F ( − 18 ° C ) or below on nine nights per annum . Summers in Albany can contain stretches of excessive heat and humidity , with temperatures of 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) or hotter on nine days per year . Record temperature extremes range from − 28 ° F ( − 33 ° C ) , on January 19 , 1971 , to 104 ° F ( 40 ° C ) on July 4 , 1911 .

 = = = Neighborhoods = = = 
 Albany 's neighborhoods are varied demographically , geographically , architecturally , and historically . Downtown Albany is the city 's oldest neighborhood , centered on State Street , one of Albany 's oldest streets and its original main street . Today downtown consists mostly of office buildings inhabited by state agencies , though a recent push to bring in permanent residents has led to proposed apartments and condominiums . North and south of Downtown are old residential communities often consisting of row houses . North is Sheridan Hollow , Arbor Hill , and North Albany ; to the south is the super @-@ neighborhood of the South End , which consists of a multitude of smaller neighborhoods including the Mansion District , the Pastures , Kenwood , <unk> , Delaware Avenue , and Krank Park . These neighborhoods tend to have more minorities and lower @-@ income residents than the western , more <unk> sections of the city . 
 West of Downtown is the Empire State Plaza , which effectively cuts Downtown off from the gentrified neighborhoods of Center Square , Hudson / Park , Lark Street , and Washington Park . Collectively referred to as mid @-@ town , these neighborhoods are often compared to New York City 's Greenwich Village for their eclectic mix of residential and commercial uses , including bars , night clubs , restaurants , and unique stores . Albany 's gay culture is vibrant in this area . Nearby Park South , a nine @-@ block area surrounding New Scotland Avenue is undergoing an urban renewal as existing housing units are removed or renovated and new office , commercial , and apartment buildings are added . New construction includes expansion of Albany Medical Center , one of the largest employers in Albany . Nearby is University Heights , a united campus consisting of Albany Medical Center Hospital , Albany Medical College , Albany Law School , Albany College of Pharmacy , and the Sage College of Albany . 
 Western neighborhoods , such as Pine Hills , Delaware Avenue , Whitehall , Helderberg , New Scotland , and Beverwyck , tend to have larger lots and more suburban surroundings . The eastern section of Pine Hills is a popular living choice for college students due to its proximity to the campuses of the College of Saint Rose and University at Albany . Further west , the neighborhoods become more affluent and are dominated almost exclusively by single @-@ family dwellings . These neighborhoods , such as Melrose , Western Pine Hills , New Albany , Eagle Hill , Westland Park , Campus , and Buckingham Pond more closely resemble neighboring areas of the suburban towns than they do the downtown parts of the city . Further west is the W. Averell Harriman State Office Campus and the University at Albany 's main campus . 
 = = = Parks and recreation = = = 
 Albany has more than 60 public parks and recreation areas . Washington Park was organized as the Middle Public Square in 1806 . Its current location has been public property since the Dongan Charter of 1686 gave the city title to all property not privately owned . Washington Park was designed by John Bogart and John Cuyler in 1870 , and opened for public use the following year . The original lake house , designed by Frederick W. Brown , was added in 1876 . The park had previously been used as a cemetery ; its graves were moved to Albany Rural Cemetery . Washington Park is a popular place to exercise and play sports ; skate during the winter ; people @-@ watch during Tulip Fest ; and attend plays at the amphitheater during the summer . 
 Other parks in Albany include Lincoln Park , Buckingham Park , the Corning Preserve , and the Pine Bush . Lincoln Park , southwest of the Empire State Plaza , was organized in 1886 and was originally known as Beaver Park . Today , the park has a pool that is open during the summer months . Buckingham Lake Park is between Manning Boulevard and Route 85 in the Buckingham Pond neighborhood ; it contains a pond with fountains , a footpath , a playground , and picnic tables . The Albany Riverfront Park at the Corning Preserve has an 800 @-@ seat amphitheatre that hosts events in non @-@ winter months , most notably the Alive at 5 summer concert series . The Preserve 's visitors center details the ecology of the Hudson River and the local environment . The park has a bike trail and boat launch and was effectively separated from downtown by Interstate 787 until the opening of the Hudson River Way in 2002 . 
 Other public parks include Westland Hill Park , Hoffman Park , Beverwyck Park , Ridgefield Park , and Liberty Park , today a small circular grassy patch in downtown on Hudson Avenue , which is Albany 's oldest park . The municipal golf course , New Course at Albany , was constructed in 1929 as the Albany Municipal Golf Course , later renamed the Capital Hills at Albany , and remodeled in 1991 . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 The Empire State Plaza , a collection of state agency office buildings , dominates almost any view of Albany . Built between 1965 and 1978 at the hand of Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller and architect Wallace Harrison , the complex is a powerful example of late American modern architecture and remains a controversial building project both for displacing city residents and for its architectural style . The most recognizable aspect of the complex is the Erastus Corning Tower , the tallest building in New York outside of New York City . <unk> at the north end of the Plaza is the 19th @-@ century New York State Capitol , the seat of the New York State Legislature and the home of the Governor 's office . 
 Albany 's initial architecture incorporated many Dutch influences , followed soon after by those of the English . Quackenbush House , a Dutch Colonial brick mansion , was built c . 1736 ; Schuyler Mansion , a Georgian @-@ style mansion , was built in 1765 ; and the oldest building currently standing in Albany is the 1728 Van <unk> @-@ <unk> House at 48 Hudson Avenue . Albany 's housing varies greatly , with mostly row houses in the older sections of town , closer to the river . Housing type quickly changes as one travels westward , beginning with two @-@ family homes of the late 19th century , and one @-@ family homes built after World War II in the western end of the city . 
 Albany City Hall , designed by Henry Hobson Richardson , was opened in 1883 . The New York State Capitol was opened in 1899 ( after 32 years of construction ) at a cost of $ 25 million , making it the most expensive government building at the time . Albany 's Union Station , a major Beaux @-@ Arts design , was under construction at the same time ; it opened in 1900 . In 1912 , the Beaux @-@ Arts styled New York State Department of Education Building opened on Washington Avenue near the Capitol . It has a classical exterior , which features a block @-@ long white marble colonnade . The 1920s brought the Art Deco movement , which is illustrated by the Home Savings Bank Building ( 1927 ) on North Pearl Street and the Alfred E. Smith Building ( 1930 ) on South Swan Street , two of Albany 's tallest high @-@ rises . 
 Architecture from the 1960s and 1970s is well represented in the city , especially at the W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus ( 1950s and 1960s ) and on the uptown campus of the University at Albany ( 1962 – 1971 ) . The state office campus was planned in the 1950s by governor W. Averell Harriman to offer more parking and easier access for state employees . The uptown SUNY campus was built in the 1960s under Governor Rockefeller on the site of the city @-@ owned Albany Country Club . <unk> from the popular open campus layout , SUNY Albany has a centralized building layout with administrative and classroom buildings at center surrounded by four student housing towers . The design called for much use of concrete and glass , and the style has slender , round @-@ topped columns and pillars reminiscent of those at Lincoln Center in New York City . 
 Downtown has seen a revival in recent decades , often considered to have begun with Norstar Bank 's renovation of the former Union Station as its corporate headquarters in 1986 . The Times Union Center ( TU Center ) was originally slated for suburban Colonie , but was instead built downtown and opened in 1990 . Other development in downtown includes the construction of the State Dormitory Authority headquarters at 515 Broadway ( 1998 ) ; the State Department of Environmental Conservation building , with its iconic green dome , at 625 Broadway ( 2001 ) ; the State Comptroller headquarters on State Street ( 2001 ) ; the Hudson River Way ( 2002 ) , a pedestrian bridge connecting Broadway to the Corning Preserve ; and 677 Broadway ( 2005 ) , " the first privately owned downtown office building in a generation " .

 Historically , Albany 's population has been mixed . First dominated by the Dutch and Germans , it was overtaken by the English in the early 19th century . Irish immigrants soon outnumbered most other ethnicities by the mid @-@ 19th century , and were followed by Italians and Poles . The mid @-@ to @-@ late 20th century saw a rise in the African @-@ American population . As historian ( and Albany Assemblyman ) John <unk> puts it , 
 Dutch and Yankee , German and Irish , Polish and Italian , black and Chinese — over the centuries Albany 's heritage has reflected a succession of immigrant nationalities . Its streets have echoed with a dozen languages , its neighborhoods adapting to the distinctive life @-@ style and changing economic fortunes of each new group . 
 Until after the Revolution , Albany 's population consisted mostly of ethnic Dutch descendants . Settlers moving in from New England tipped the balance toward British ethnicity in the early 19th century . Jobs on the turnpikes , canals , and railroads brought in floods of Irish immigrants in the early 19th century , especially in the 1840s during the Irish potato famine , solidifying the city 's Irish base . Albany elected its first Irish Catholic mayor ( Michael Nolan ) two years before Boston did . Polish and Italian immigrants began arriving in Albany in the wave of immigration in the latter part of the 19th century . Their numbers were smaller than in many other eastern cities mainly because most had found manufacturing jobs at General Electric in Schenectady . The Jewish community , with Sephardic Jewish members part of the Beverwijck community , also saw a rise in population during the late 19th century , when many Ashkenazi Jews immigrated from eastern Europe . In that period , there was also an influx of Chinese and east Asian immigrants , who settled in the downtown section of the city . Many of their descendants have since moved to suburban areas . Immigration all but halted after the Immigration Act of 1924 . Albany was also a destination of internal migration , as many African Americans moved north in their Great Migration from the rural South before and after World War I to fill industrial positions . As a percentage , the black community has grown substantially since then : African Americans made up 3 percent of the population in 1950 , 6 percent in 1960 , 12 percent in 1970 , and 30 percent in 2010 . The change in proportion is related mostly to middle @-@ class white families moving to the suburbs , and black families remaining within city limits during the same time period .

The Albany Medical College ( private ) , today part of Albany Medical Center , was founded in 1838 . Albany Law School ( private ) is the oldest law school in New York and the fourth oldest in the country ; it was opened in 1851 . President William McKinley was an alumnus . The Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences ( private ) is the second oldest pharmacy school in New York and the fifteenth oldest in the United States . 
 The New York State Normal School , one of the oldest teachers colleges in the United States , opened in 1905 ; it was later known as the State Teachers College . It eventually evolved into the University at Albany , also known as SUNY Albany ( public ) , which inherited the Normal School 's original downtown campus on Western Avenue . The center of the campus moved to its current Uptown Campus in the west end of the city in 1970 . SUNY Albany is a unit of the State University of New York and one of only four university centers in the system . Other colleges and universities in Albany include Empire State College , The College of Saint Rose , Excelsior College , Maria College , Mildred Elley , and Sage College of Albany . Nearby Hudson Valley Community College ( <unk> ) fills the community college niche in the Albany @-@ Troy area . The effect of the campuses on the city 's population is substantial : Combining the student bodies of all the aforementioned campuses ( except <unk> ) results in 63 @,@ 149 students , or almost 70 percent of the 2008 estimate of Albany 's permanent population . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Albany 's economy , along with that of the Capital District in general , is heavily dependent on government , health care , education , and more recently , technology . Because of these typically steady economic bases , the local economy has been relatively immune to national economic recessions in the past . More than 25 percent of the city 's population works in government @-@ related positions . The current recession has been more difficult to deal with because of the many issues on Wall Street , from which the state government receives much of its tax revenue . In March 2010 , the Albany area had the lowest unemployment rate of any major metropolitan area in New York , at 7 @.@ 8 % , compared to 9 @.@ 4 % in New York as a whole . Albany 's estimated daytime population is more than 162 @,@ 000 . Companies based in Albany include Trans World Entertainment and Clough Harbour . 
 = = = Tech Valley = = = 
 Since the 2000s , the economy of Albany and the surrounding Capital District has been redirected toward a high technology focus . Tech Valley is a marketing name for the eastern part of New York State , encompassing Albany , the Capital District , and the Hudson Valley . <unk> in 1998 to promote the greater Albany area as a high @-@ tech competitor to regions such as Silicon Valley and Boston , it has since grown to represent the counties in the Capital District and extending to 19 counties from IBM 's Westchester County plants in the south to the Canadian border in the north . The area 's high technology ecosystem is supported by technologically focused academic institutions including Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute . Tech Valley encompasses 19 counties straddling both sides of the Adirondack Northway and the New York Thruway , and with heavy state taxpayer subsidy , has experienced significant growth in the computer hardware side of the high @-@ technology industry , with great strides in the nanotechnology sector , digital electronics design , and water- and electricity @-@ dependent integrated microchip circuit manufacturing . 
 In 2012 , the Albany @-@ Schenectady area was listed fourth on Forbes Magazine 's annual " Best Cities for Jobs " list , noting that job losses in state and local government were overcome by expansion of the high @-@ tech field .

 Albany has a mayor @-@ council form of government , which currently functions under a charter adopted in 1998 . The 1998 charter completely <unk> the original 17th @-@ century Dongan Charter . However , in an effort to keep Dongan in effect , the new charter was applied strictly as an amendment to Dongan , meaning Dongan is technically still in effect , giving Albany the distinction of having the oldest active city charter in the United States and " arguably the longest @-@ running instrument of municipal government in the Western Hemisphere . " The mayor , who is elected every four years , heads the executive branch of city government . The current mayor , Kathy Sheehan , was first elected in 2013 . She replaced former mayor Gerald Jennings who was mayor for 20 years from 1994 to 2013 . The Common Council represents the legislative branch of city government and is made up of fifteen council members ( each elected from one ward ) and an at @-@ large Common Council President . The current president is Carolyn McLaughlin ; she began her term in January 2010 . 
 While Albany has its own city government , it has also been the seat of Albany County since the county 's formation in 1683 and the capital of New York since 1797 . As such , the city is home to all branches of the county and state governments , as well as its own . Albany City Hall sits on Eagle Street , opposite the State Capitol , and the Albany County Office Building is on State Street . The state government has offices scattered throughout the city . 
 Albany is in the 20th Congressional district , represented by Paul <unk> ( D ) in the United States House of Representatives . The city is represented by Chuck Schumer ( D ) and Kirsten Gillibrand ( D ) in the United States Senate .

Albany is the site of a United States district court for the Northern District of New York courthouse . 
 = = = Politics = = = 
 Albany 's politics have been dominated by the Democratic Party since the 1920s ; Daniel ( Uncle Dan ) O 'Connell established a political machine in the city with the election of William Stormont Hackett as mayor in 1922 . Prior to that , William ( Billy ) Barnes had set up a Republican machine in the 1890s . Barnes ' success is attributed to the fact that he owned two newspapers in Albany and that he was the grandson of Thurlow Weed , the influential newspaper publisher and political boss . O 'Connell 's organization overcame Barnes ' in 1922 and survived well into the 1980s ( even after his death ) , as the machine put forth candidates for whom the electorate dutifully voted . In many instances , votes were outright bought ; it was not uncommon for the machine to " buy poor folks ' loyalty and trust with a <unk> " . 
 Gerald Jennings ' upset in the 1993 Democratic mayoral primary over Harold Joyce , who had the Democratic Party 's formal endorsement and had only recently been its county chairman , is often cited as the end of the O 'Connell era in Albany . Albany continues to be dominated by the Democratic party as enrollment in the city was 38 @,@ 862 in 2009 compared to Republican enrollment of 3 @,@ 487 . This gives Democrats a 10 – 1 advantage in the general election . Every elected city position has been held by a Democrat since 1931 . 
 In November 2013 , Kathy Sheehan became the first woman to be elected Mayor of Albany .

 = No. 11 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF = 
 No. 11 Elementary Flying Training School ( No. 11 EFTS ) was a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) pilot training unit that operated during World War II . It was one of twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia 's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme . No. 11 EFTS was established in June 1941 at Benalla , Victoria , and operated Tiger Moths and Wackett Trainers during the war . It ceased training in July 1945 after almost 3 @,@ 000 students had passed through , and was re @-@ formed as Care and Maintenance Unit ( CMU ) Benalla in February 1946 . CMU Benalla was disbanded in October 1948 . 
 = = History = = 
 Flying instruction in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World War II , in response to a vast increase in the number of aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia 's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme ( EATS ) . The Air Force 's pre @-@ war pilot training facility , No. 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook , Victoria , was supplanted in 1940 – 41 by twelve elementary flying training schools ( EFTS ) and eight service flying training schools ( SFTS ) . The EFTS provided a twelve @-@ week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF 's initial training schools . Flying training was undertaken in two stages : the first involved four weeks of instruction ( including ten hours of flying ) to determine trainees ' suitability to become pilots . Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training ( including sixty @-@ five hours of flying ) at the EFTS . Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators . 
 No. 11 Elementary Flying Training School ( No. 11 EFTS ) was formed at Benalla , Victoria , on 26 June 1941 , and came under the control of Southern Area Command . Its inaugural commanding officer was Squadron Leader I.C.C. Thomson . Before being taken over by the RAAF , Benalla was an emergency runway for civil aircraft on the journey between Sydney and Melbourne . No. 11 EFTS 's infrastructure , which included medical facilities and two satellite airstrips , had been budgeted at some £ 85 @,@ 000 , primarily for buildings and engineering works . When the school opened , however , only stores depots and living quarters for the 100 @-@ odd staff were completed ; instructional courses , which commenced on 24 July , were initially held in tents near the main airstrip . No hangars were constructed for the de Havilland Tiger Moth training aircraft until towards the end of the year . 
 Flying at Benalla was hampered by bad weather , and the runway was unusable from September to November 1941 , necessitating the detachment of over 250 personnel to Essendon , home of No. 3 EFTS , to continue their training . In October 1941 , six airmen of No. 11 EFTS were court @-@ martialled for mutiny . Their main grievance was having to undertake guard duty at night and attend parades at 7 : 15 am in addition to their regular ground support work . One of the men was found guilty of incitement and the other five for failing to report their knowledge of the matter to the commanding officer . The former was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment and the others to between five and six months detention ; all were discharged from the Air Force . On 11 December 1941 , one of the school 's Tiger Moths made a crash landing in a field and struck four people on the ground , killing two and injuring the others ; the two pilots were uninjured . The outbreak of war in the Pacific saw slit trenches being dug at the base . 
 The school began replacing its Tiger Moths with CAC Wackett Trainers in January 1942 . No. 11 EFTS absorbed No. 3 EFTS 's instructors , students and Wackett Trainers in April , shortly before the latter unit disbanded . The same month at Benalla , thirty @-@ two United States Army Air Corps pilots undertook four weeks of flying in the Wacketts . On 5 September 1942 , one of the Wacketts crashed after apparently stalling on takeoff , killing the trainee and seriously injuring the pilot . The Wackett Trainers were taken out of service for upgrades in February 1943 , and the school again began operating Tiger Moths . One pilot was killed and another seriously injured when their Tiger Moths collided shortly after takeoff on 15 June . On 7 July , one of the Tiger Moths crashed during a night @-@ flying exercise just east of Benalla , killing both pilots . Another Tiger Moth and its pilot were lost in a crash west of Benalla on 20 October 1943 . On 14 May 1944 , a pilot was killed and a trainee seriously injured when their Tiger Moth spun out of control during an instrument test north of Benalla . 
 Flying training at No. 11 EFTS had largely wound down by May 1945 . Ten students from the Netherlands East Indies underwent courses in June , and in July all instruction stopped , by which time 2 @,@ 953 trainees had attended the school . No. 11 EFTS 's facilities were used to establish Care and Maintenance Unit ( CMU ) Benalla on 28 February 1946 . It was one of many <unk> that the RAAF raised after the war for the storage and upkeep of surplus aircraft prior to their disposal . CMU Benalla was responsible for maintaining North American P @-@ 51 Mustangs . It transferred all its aircraft to CMU Tocumwal , New South Wales , on 15 October 1948 , and disbanded the same day . 
 A memorial to No. 11 EFTS was dedicated at Benalla on 17 June 1995 . 
 = Book of Kells = 
 The Book of Kells ( Irish : <unk> <unk> ; Dublin , Trinity College Library , MS A. I. [ 58 ] , sometimes known as the Book of Columba ) is an illuminated manuscript Gospel book in Latin , containing the four Gospels of the New Testament together with various prefatory texts and tables . It was created in a Columban monastery in Ireland or may have had contributions from various Columban institutions from both Britain and Ireland . It is believed to have been created c . 800 . The text of the Gospels is largely drawn from the Vulgate , although it also includes several passages drawn from the earlier versions of the Bible known as the <unk> Latina . It is a masterwork of Western calligraphy and represents the pinnacle of Insular illumination . It is also widely regarded as Ireland 's finest national treasure . 
 The illustrations and ornamentation of the Book of Kells surpass that of other Insular Gospel books in extravagance and complexity . The decoration combines traditional Christian iconography with the ornate swirling motifs typical of Insular art . Figures of humans , animals and mythical beasts , together with Celtic knots and interlacing patterns in vibrant colours , enliven the manuscript 's pages . Many of these minor decorative elements are imbued with Christian symbolism and so further emphasise the themes of the major illustrations . 
 The manuscript today comprises 340 folios and , since 1953 , has been bound in four volumes . The leaves are on high @-@ quality calf vellum , and the unprecedentedly elaborate ornamentation that covers them includes ten full @-@ page illustrations and text pages that are vibrant with decorated initials and interlinear miniatures and mark the furthest extension of the anti @-@ classical and energetic qualities of Insular art . The Insular majuscule script of the text itself appears to be the work of at least three different scribes . The lettering is in iron gall ink , and the colours used were derived from a wide range of substances , many of which were imports from distant lands . 
 The manuscript takes its name from the Abbey of Kells , which was its home for centuries . Today , it is on permanent display at Trinity College Library , Dublin . The Library usually displays two of the current four volumes at a time , one showing a major illustration and the other showing typical text pages , and the entire manuscript can be viewed on the Library 's Digital Collections Repository . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origin = = = 
 The Book of Kells is one of the finest and most famous of a group of manuscripts in what is known as the Insular style , produced from the late 6th through the early 9th centuries in monasteries in Ireland , Scotland and England and in continental monasteries with Hiberno @-@ Scottish or Anglo @-@ Saxon foundations . These manuscripts include the <unk> of St. Columba , the Ambrosiana Orosius , fragmentary Gospel in the Durham Dean and Chapter Library ( all from the early 7th century ) , and the Book of Durrow ( from the second half of the 7th century ) . From the early 8th century come the Durham Gospels , the Echternach Gospels , the Lindisfarne Gospels ( see illustration at right ) , and the Lichfield Gospels . Among others , the St. Gall Gospel Book belongs to the late 8th century and the Book of Armagh ( dated to 807 – 809 ) to the early 9th century . Scholars place these manuscripts together based on similarities in artistic style , script , and textual traditions . The fully developed style of the ornamentation of the Book of Kells places it late in this series , either from the late 8th or early 9th century . The Book of Kells follows many of the iconographic and stylistic traditions found in these earlier manuscripts . For example , the form of the decorated letters found in the incipit pages for the Gospels is surprisingly consistent in Insular Gospels . Compare , for example , the incipit pages of the Gospel of Matthew in the Lindisfarne Gospels and in the Book of Kells , both of which feature intricate decorative knot work patterns inside the outlines formed by the enlarged initial letters of the text . ( For a more complete list of related manuscripts , see : List of Hiberno @-@ Saxon illustrated manuscripts ) . 
 The name Book of Kells is derived from the Abbey of Kells in Kells , County Meath , which was its home for much of the medieval period . The manuscript 's date and place of production have been the subject of considerable debate . Traditionally , the book was thought to have been created in the time of Columba , possibly even as the work of his own hands . This tradition has long been discredited on paleographic and stylistic grounds : most evidence points to a composition date c . 800 , long after St. Columba 's death in 597 . The proposed dating in the 9th century coincides with Viking raids on Iona , which began in 794 and eventually dispersed the monks and their holy relics into Ireland and Scotland . There is another tradition , with some traction among Irish scholars , that suggests the manuscript was created for the 200th anniversary of the saint 's death . 
 There are at least five competing theories about the manuscript 's place of origin and time of completion . First , the book , or perhaps just the text , may have been created at Iona , then brought to Kells , where the illuminations were perhaps added , and never finished . Second , the book may have been produced entirely at Iona . Third , the manuscript may have been produced entirely in the scriptorium at Kells . Fourth , it may have been produced in the north of England , perhaps at Lindisfarne , then brought to Iona and from there to Kells . Finally , it may have been the product of an unknown monastery in Pictish Scotland , though there is no actual evidence for this theory , especially considering the absence of any surviving manuscript from Pictland . Although the question of the exact location of the book 's production will probably never be answered conclusively , the first theory , that it was begun at Iona and continued at Kells , is widely accepted . Regardless of which theory is true , it is certain that the Book of Kells was produced by Columban monks closely associated with the community at Iona . 
 = = = Medieval period = = = 
 Kells Abbey was plundered and pillaged by Vikings many times in the 10th century , and how the book survived is not known . The earliest historical reference to the book , and indeed to the book 's presence at Kells , can be found in a 1007 entry in the Annals of Ulster . This entry records that " the great Gospel of Columkille , ( Columba ) the chief relic of the Western World , was wickedly stolen during the night from the western sacristy of the great stone church at <unk> on account of its wrought shrine " . The manuscript was recovered a few months later — minus its golden and bejewelled cover — " under a sod " . It is generally assumed that the " great Gospel of Columkille " is the Book of Kells . If this is correct , then the book was in Kells by 1007 and had been there long enough for thieves to learn of its presence . The force of ripping the manuscript free from its cover may account for the folios missing from the beginning and end of the Book of Kells . The description in the Annals of the book as " of Columkille " — that is , having belonged to , and perhaps being made by Columba — suggests that the book was believed at that time to have been made on Iona . 
 Regardless , the book was certainly at Kells in the 12th century , when land charters pertaining to the Abbey of Kells were copied onto some of its blank pages . The practice of copying of charters into important books was widespread in the medieval period , and such inscriptions in the Book of Kells provide concrete evidence about its location at the time . 
 The Abbey of Kells was dissolved due to the ecclesiastical reforms of the 12th century . The abbey church was converted to a parish church in which the Book of Kells remained . 
 = = = = Book of Kildare = = = = 
 The 12th @-@ century writer Gerald of Wales , in his <unk> Hibernica , described in a famous passage seeing a great Gospel Book in Kildare which many have since assumed was the Book of Kells . The description certainly matches Kells : 
 This book contains the harmony of the Four Evangelists according to Jerome , where for almost every page there are different designs , distinguished by varied colours . Here you may see the face of majesty , divinely drawn , here the mystic symbols of the Evangelists , each with wings , now six , now four , now two ; here the eagle , there the calf , here the man and there the lion , and other forms almost infinite . Look at them superficially with the ordinary glance , and you would think it is an erasure , and not tracery . Fine craftsmanship is all about you , but you might not notice it . Look more keenly at it and you will penetrate to the very shrine of art . You will make out intricacies , so delicate and so subtle , so full of knots and links , with colours so fresh and vivid , that you might say that all this were the work of an angel , and not of a man . 
 Since Gerald claims to have seen this book in Kildare , he may have seen another , now lost , book equal in quality to the Book of Kells , or he may have misstated his location . 
 = = = Modern period = = = 
 The Book of Kells remained in Kells until 1654 . In that year , Cromwell 's cavalry was quartered in the church at Kells , and the governor of the town sent the book to Dublin for safekeeping . Henry Jones , who later became bishop of Meath after the Restoration , presented the manuscript to Trinity College in Dublin in 1661 , and it has remained there ever since , except for brief loans to other libraries and museums . It has been on display to the public in the Old Library at Trinity since the 19th century . 
 Over the years , the Book of Kells received several additions to its text . In the 16th century , one Gerald Plunkett of Dublin added a series of Roman numerals numbering the chapters of the Gospels according to the division created by 13th @-@ century Archbishop of Canterbury Stephen Langton . The prominent Anglican clergyman James Ussher counted and numbered its folios in 1621 , shortly after James VI and I named him Bishop of Meath . Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were invited to sign the book in 1849 ; however , they in fact signed a modern flyleaf which was erroneously believed to have been one of the original folios . The page bearing their signatures was removed when the book was rebound in 1953 . 
 Over the centuries , the book has been rebound several times . During an 18th @-@ century rebinding , the pages were rather unsympathetically cropped , with small parts of some illustrations being lost . The book was also rebound in 1895 , but that rebinding broke down quickly . By the late 1920s , several folios had detached completely and were kept separate from the main volume . In 1953 , bookbinder Roger Powell rebound the manuscript in four volumes and stretched several pages that had developed bulges . Two volumes can normally be seen displayed at Trinity , one opened at a major decorated page , and one opened to show two text pages with smaller decorations . 
 In 2000 , the volume containing the Gospel of Mark was sent to Canberra , Australia , for an exhibition of illuminated manuscripts . This was only the fourth time the Book of Kells had been sent abroad for exhibition . Unfortunately , the volume suffered what has been called " minor pigment damage " while en route to Canberra . It is thought that the vibrations from the aeroplane 's engines during the long flight may have caused the damage .

 In 1951 , the Swiss publisher Urs Graf Verlag Bern produced the first facsimile of the Book of Kells . The majority of the pages were reproduced in black @-@ and @-@ white photographs , but the edition also featured forty @-@ eight colour reproductions , including all the full @-@ page decorations . Under licence from the Board of Trinity College Dublin , Thames and Hudson produced a second facsimile edition in 1974 . This edition included all the full @-@ page illustrations in the manuscript and a representative section of the ornamentation of the text pages , together with some enlarged details of the illustrations . The reproductions were all in full colour , with photography by John Kennedy , Green Studio , Dublin . 
 In 1979 , Swiss publisher Faksimile @-@ Verlag <unk> requested permission to produce a full @-@ colour facsimile of the book . Permission was initially denied , because Trinity College officials felt that the risk of damage to the book was too high . By 1986 , Faksimile @-@ Verlag had developed a process that used gentle suction to straighten a page so that it could be photographed without touching it and so won permission to publish a new facsimile . After each page was photographed , a single @-@ page facsimile was prepared so the colours could be carefully compared to the original and adjustments made where necessary . The completed work was published in 1990 in a two @-@ volume set containing the full facsimile and scholarly commentary . One copy is held by the Anglican Church in Kells , on the site of the original monastery . 
 Mario Kleff also reproduced folios from the Book of Kells and together with Faksimile @-@ Verlag Publisher Urs <unk> , curated an exhibition of the Book of Kells which included these facsimile pages . These facsimiles were created using the original techniques and were also presented in the Diocesan Museum of Trier . 
 In 1994 , Bernard Meehan , Keeper of Manuscripts at Trinity College Dublin , produced an introductory booklet on the Book of Kells , with 110 colour images of the manuscript . His 2012 book contained more than 80 pages from the manuscript reproduced full @-@ size and in full colour . 
 A digital copy of the manuscript was produced by Trinity College in 2006 and was made available for purchase through Trinity College on DVD @-@ Rom . It included the ability to leaf through each page , two pages at a time or look at a single page in a magnified setting . There were also a number of commentary tracks about the specific pages as well as the history of the book . Users were given the option to search by specific illuminated categories including animals , capitols and angels . It retailed for approximately € 30 but has since been discontinued . The Faksimile @-@ Verlag images are now online at Trinity College 's Digital Collections portal . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Book of Kells contains the four Gospels of the Christian scriptures written in black , red , purple , and yellow ink in an insular majuscule script , preceded by prefaces , summaries , and concordances of Gospel passages . Today , it consists of 340 vellum leaves , or folios . The majority of the folios are part of larger sheets , called bifolios , which are folded in half to form two folios . The bifolios are nested inside of each other and sewn together to form gatherings called quires . On occasion , a folio is not part of a <unk> but is instead a single sheet inserted within a quire . The extant folios are gathered into 38 quires . There are between four and twelve folios ( two to six bifolios ) per quire ; the folios are commonly , but not invariably , bound in groups of ten . Some folios are single sheets , as is frequently the case with the important decorated pages . The folios had lines drawn for the text , sometimes on both sides , after the bifolios were folded . Prick marks and guide lines can still be seen on some pages . The vellum is of high quality , although the folios have an uneven thickness , with some being close to leather while others are so thin as to be almost translucent . 
 The book 's current dimensions are 330 by 250 mm . Originally , the folios were of no standard size , but they were cropped to the current size during a 19th @-@ century rebinding . The text area is approximately 250 by 170 mm . Each text page has 16 to 18 lines of text . The manuscript is in remarkably good condition considering its great age , though many pages have suffered some damage to the delicate artwork due to rubbing . The book must have been the product of a major scriptorium over several years , yet was apparently never finished , the projected decoration of some pages appearing only in outline . It is believed that some 30 folios of the original manuscript have been lost over the centuries . Ussher counted 344 folios in 1621 , but several leaves had already been lost by then . The overall estimate is based on gaps in the text and the absence of certain key illustrations . 
 = = = Contents = = = 
 The extant book contains preliminary matter , the complete text of the Gospels of Matthew , Mark and Luke , and the Gospel of John through John 17 : 13 . The remainder of John and an unknown amount of the preliminary matter is missing and was perhaps lost when the book was stolen early in the 11th century . The remaining preliminary matter consists of two fragmentary lists of Hebrew names contained in the Gospels , Breves causae ( Gospel summaries ) , Argumenta ( short biographies of the Evangelists ) , and Eusebian canon tables . It is probable that , like the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Books of Durrow and Armagh , part of the lost preliminary material included the letter of Jerome to Pope <unk> I beginning Novum opus , in which Jerome explains the purpose of his translation . It is also possible , though less likely , that the lost material included the letter of Eusebius to <unk> , in which he explains the use of the canon tables . Of all the insular Gospels , only the Lindisfarne manuscript contains this letter . 
 There are two fragments of the lists of Hebrew names ; one on the recto of the first surviving folio and one on folio 26 , which is currently inserted at the end of the prefatory matter for John . The first list fragment contains the end of the list for the Gospel of Matthew . The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two folios . The second list fragment , on folio 26 , contains about a fourth of the list for Luke . The list for Luke would require an additional three folios . The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three folios missing between folios 26 and 27 , so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location . There is no trace of the lists for Mark and John . 
 The first list fragment is followed by the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea . These tables , which predate the text of the Vulgate , were developed to cross @-@ reference the Gospels . Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels . The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most mediaeval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels . The tables in the Book of Kells , however , are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables in such a way as to make them confused . In addition , the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text , making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon tables refer . The reason for the omission remains unclear : the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript 's completion , or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages . 
 The Breves causae and Argumenta belong to a pre @-@ Vulgate tradition of manuscripts . The Breves causae are summaries of the Old Latin translations of the Gospels and are divided into numbered chapters . These chapter numbers , like the numbers for the canon tables , are not used on the text pages of the Gospels . It is unlikely that these numbers would have been used , even if the manuscript had been completed , because the chapter numbers corresponded to old Latin translations and would have been difficult to harmonise with the Vulgate text . The Argumenta are collections of legends about the Evangelists . The Breves causae and Argumenta are arranged in a strange order : first come the Breves causae and Argumenta for Matthew , followed by the Breves and Argumenta for Mark , then , quite oddly , come the Argumenta of both Luke and John , followed by their Breves causae . This anomalous order mirrors that found in the Book of Durrow , although in the latter instance , the misplaced sections appear at the very end of the manuscript rather than as part of a continuous preliminary . In other insular manuscripts , such as the Lindisfarne Gospels , the Book of Armagh , and the Echternach Gospels , each Gospel is treated as a separate work and has its preliminaries immediately preceding it . The slavish repetition in Kells of the order of the Breves causae and Argumenta found in Durrow led scholar T. K. Abbott to the conclusion that the scribe of Kells had either the Book of Durrow or a common model in hand . 
 = = = Text and script = = = 
 The Book of Kells contains the text of the four Gospels based on the Vulgate . It does not , however , contain a pure copy of the Vulgate . There are numerous differences from the Vulgate , where Old Latin translations are used in lieu of Jerome 's text . Although such variants are common in all the insular Gospels , there does not seem to be a consistent pattern of variation amongst the various insular texts . Evidence suggests that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar . 
 The manuscript is written primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of minuscule letters ( usually e or s ) . The text is usually written in one long line across the page . Françoise Henry identified at least three scribes in this manuscript , whom she named Hand A , Hand B , and Hand C. Hand A is found on folios 1 through <unk> , folios 276 through 289 , and folios 307 through the end of the manuscript . Hand A , for the most part , writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall @-@ ink common throughout the West . Hand B is found on folios <unk> through 26 and folios 124 through 128 . Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red , purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page . Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text . Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A. Hand C uses the same brownish gall @-@ ink used by hand A and wrote , almost always , seventeen lines per page . 
 = = = = Errors and deviations = = = = 
 There are a number of differences between the text and the accepted Gospels . In the genealogy of Jesus , which starts at Luke 3 : 23 , Kells names an extra ancestor . 
 Matthew 10 : <unk> The canonised Bible reads " I came not to send peace , but a sword , " but the manuscript reads <unk> ( " joy " ) where it should read <unk> ( " sword " ) and so translates as " I came not [ only ] to send peace , but joy . " 
 The lavishly decorated opening page of the Gospel according to John in the Book of Kells had been deciphered by George Bain as : " In principio erat verbum verum " [ In the beginning was the True Word ] . Therefore , the Incipit is a free translation into Latin of the Greek original <unk> rather than a mere copy of the Roman version . 
 = = = Decoration = = = 
 The text is accompanied by many full @-@ page miniatures , while smaller painted decorations appear throughout the text in unprecedented quantities . The decoration of the book is famous for combining intricate detail with bold and energetic compositions . The characteristics of the Insular manuscript initial , as described by Carl <unk> , here reach their most extreme realisation : " the initials ... are conceived as elastic forms expanding and contracting with a pulsating rhythm . The kinetic energy of their contours escapes into freely drawn appendices , a spiral line which in turn generates new curvilinear motifs ... " . The illustrations feature a broad range of colours , with purple , lilac , red , pink , green , and yellow being the colours most often used . Earlier manuscripts tend toward more narrow palettes : the Book of Durrow , for example , uses only four colours . As is usual with Insular work , there was no use of gold or silver leaf in the manuscript . The pigments for the illustrations , which included red and yellow ochre , green copper pigment ( sometimes called verdigris ) , indigo , and possibly lapis lazuli , would have been imported from the Mediterranean region and , in the case of the lapis lazuli , from northeast Afghanistan . Though the presence of lapis lazuli has long been considered evidence of the great cost required to create the manuscript , recent examination of the pigments has proven that lapis lazuli was not used . 
 The lavish illumination programme is far greater than any other surviving Insular Gospel book . There are ten surviving full @-@ page illuminations including two evangelist portraits , three pages with the four evangelist symbols , a carpet page , a miniature of the Virgin and Child , a miniature of Christ enthroned , and miniatures of the Arrest of Jesus and the Temptation of Christ . There are thirteen surviving full pages of decorated text including pages for the first few words of each of the Gospels . Eight of the ten pages of the canon tables have extensive decoration . It is highly probable that there were other pages of miniature and decorated text that are now lost . In addition to these major pages , there are a host of smaller decorations and decorated initials throughout the text ; in fact only two pages have no decoration . 
 The extant folios of the manuscript start with the fragment of the glossary of Hebrew names . This fragment occupies the left @-@ hand column of folio <unk> . A miniature of the four evangelist symbols , now much abraded , make up the right @-@ hand column . The miniature is oriented so that the volume must be turned ninety degrees to view it properly . The four evangelist symbols are a visual theme that runs throughout the book . They are almost always shown together to emphasise the doctrine of the four Gospels ' unity of message . 
 The unity of the Gospels is further emphasised by the decoration of the Eusebian canon tables . The canon tables themselves inherently illustrate the unity of the Gospels by organising corresponding passages from the Gospels . The Eusebian canon tables normally require twelve pages . In the Book of Kells , the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages ( folios 1v through <unk> ) but for unknown reasons , condensed them into ten , leaving folios <unk> and <unk> blank . This condensation rendered the canon tables unusable . The decoration of the first eight pages of the canon tables is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean , where it was traditional to enclose the tables within an arcade ( as seen in the London Canon Tables ) . The Kells manuscript presents this motif in an Insular spirit , where the arcades are not seen as architectural elements but rather become stylised geometric patterns with Insular ornamentation . The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches . The last two canon tables are presented within a grid . This presentation is limited to Insular manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow . 
 The remainder of the book is broken into sections with the divisions set off by miniatures and full pages of decorated text . Each of the Gospels is introduced by a consistent decorative programme . The preliminary matter is treated as one section and introduced by a lavish decorative spread . In addition to the preliminaries and the Gospels , the " second beginning " of the Gospel of Matthew is also given its own introductory decoration . 
 The preliminary matter is introduced by an iconic image of the Virgin and Child ( folio <unk> ) . This miniature is the first representation of the Virgin in a Western manuscript . Mary is shown in an odd mixture of frontal and three @-@ quarter pose . This miniature also bears a stylistic similarity to the carved image on the lid of St. Cuthbert 's coffin of 698 . The iconography of the miniature may derive from an Eastern or Coptic icon . 
 The miniature of the Virgin and Child faces the first page of text and is an appropriate preface to the beginning of the Breves Causae of Matthew , which begins <unk> Christi in Bethlem ( the birth of Christ in Bethlehem ) . The beginning page ( folio <unk> ) of the text of the Breves Causae is decorated and contained within an elaborate frame . The two @-@ page spread of the miniature and the text makes a vivid introductory statement for the prefatory material . The opening line of each of the sections of the preliminary matter is enlarged and decorated ( see above for the Breves causae of Luke ) , but no other section of the preliminaries is given the same level of treatment as the beginning of the Breves Causae of Matthew . 
 The book was designed so that each of the Gospels would have an elaborate introductory decorative programme . Each Gospel was originally prefaced by a full page miniature containing the four evangelist symbols , followed by a blank page . Then came a portrait of the evangelist which faced the opening text of the Gospel which was given an elaborate decorative treatment . The Gospel of Matthew retains both its Evangelist portrait ( folio <unk> ) and its page of Evangelist symbols ( folio <unk> , see above ) . The Gospel of Mark is missing the Evangelist portrait but retains its Evangelist symbols page ( folio <unk> ) . The Gospel of Luke is missing both the portrait and the Evangelist symbols page . The Gospel of John , like the Gospel of Matthew , retains both its portrait ( folio <unk> , see at right ) and its Evangelist symbols page ( folio <unk> ) . It can be assumed that the portraits for Mark and Luke and the symbols page for Luke at one time existed but have been lost . The use of all four of the Evangelist symbols in front of each Gospel is striking and was intended to reinforce the message of the unity of the Gospels . 
 The decoration of the opening few words of each Gospel was lavish . These pages were , in effect , turned into carpet pages . The decoration of these texts is so elaborate that the text itself is almost illegible . The opening page ( folio <unk> ) of Matthew may stand as an example . ( See illustration at left . ) The page consists of only two words : Liber <unk> ( " The book of the generation " ) . The lib of Liber is turned into a giant monogram which dominates the entire page . The er of Liber is presented as an interlaced ornament within the b of the lib monogram . <unk> is broken into three lines and contained within an elaborate frame in the right lower quadrant of the page . The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border . 
 The border and the letters themselves are further decorated with elaborate spirals and knot work , many of them zoomorphic . The opening words of Mark , <unk> evangelii ( " The beginning of the Gospel " ) , Luke , Quoniam quidem multi , and John , In principio erat verbum ( " In the beginning was the Word " ) , are all given similar treatments . Although the decoration of these pages was most extensive in the Book of Kells , these pages were decorated in all the other Insular Gospel Books . 
 The Gospel of Matthew begins with a genealogy of Jesus . At Matthew 1 : 18 , the actual narrative of Christ 's life starts . This " second beginning " to Matthew was given emphasis in many early Gospel Books , so much so that the two sections were often treated as separate works . The second beginning begins with the word Christ . The Greek letters chi and rho were normally used in mediaeval manuscripts to abbreviate the word Christ . In Insular Gospel Books , the initial Chi Rho monogram was enlarged and decorated . In the Book of Kells , this second beginning was given a decorative programme equal to those that preface the individual Gospels . Folio 32 verso has a miniature of Christ enthroned . ( It has been argued that this miniature is one of the lost evangelist portraits . However , the iconography is quite different from the extant portraits , and current scholarship accepts this identification and placement for this miniature . ) Facing this miniature , on folio 33 recto , is the only carpet page in the Book of Kells , which is rather anomalous ; the Lindisfarne Gospels has five extant carpet pages and the Book of Durrow has six . The blank verso of folio 33 faces the single most lavish miniature of the early mediaeval period , the Book of Kells Chi Rho monogram , which serves as incipit for the narrative of the life of Christ . 
 In the Book of Kells , the Chi Rho monogram has grown to consume the entire page . The letter chi dominates the page with one arm swooping across the majority of the page . The letter rho is <unk> underneath the arms of the chi . Both letters are divided into compartments which are lavishly decorated with knot work and other patterns . The background is likewise awash in a mass of swirling and knotted decoration . Within this mass of decoration are hidden animals and insects . Three angels arise from one of the cross arms of the chi . This miniature is the largest and most lavish extant Chi Rho monogram in any Insular Gospel Books and is the culmination of a tradition that started with the Book of Durrow . 
 The Book of Kells contains two other full @-@ page miniatures , which illustrate episodes from the Passion story . The text of Matthew is illustrated with a full @-@ page illumination of the Arrest of Christ ( folio <unk> ) . Jesus is shown beneath a stylised arcade while being held by two much smaller figures . In the text of Luke , there is a full sized miniature of the Temptation of Christ ( folio <unk> ) . Christ is shown from the waist up on top of the Temple . To his right is a crowd of people , perhaps representing his disciples . To his left and below him is a black figure of Satan . Above him hover two angels . 
 The verso of the folio containing the Arrest of Christ contains a full page of decorated text which begins " <unk> <unk> <unk> " . Facing the miniature of the Temptation is another full page of decorated text ( folio <unk> " Iesus autem plenus " ) . In addition to this page , five other full pages also receive elaborate treatment . In Matthew , there is one other full @-@ page treatment ( folio <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> cum eo duos <unk> " ) . In the Gospel of Mark , there are also two pages of decorated text ( folio <unk> , " Erat autem hora <unk> " , and folio <unk> , " [ Et Dominus ] quidem [ Iesus ] <unk> " ) . The Gospel of Luke contains two pages of fully decorated text ( folio <unk> , " <unk> in <unk> <unk> " , and folio <unk> , " Una autem <unk> valde " ) . Although these texts do not have miniatures associated with them , it is probable that miniatures were planned to accompany each of these texts and have either been lost or were never completed . There is no surviving full page of text in the Gospel of John other than the Incipit . However , in the other three Gospels , all the full pages of decorated text , except for folio <unk> , which begins the Nativity narration , occur within the Passion narrative . However , since the missing folios of John contain the Passion narrative , it is likely that John contained full pages of decorated text that have been lost . 
 The decoration of the book is not limited to the major pages . Scattered through the text are decorated initials and small figures of animals and humans often twisted and tied into complicated knots . Many significant texts , such as the Pater Noster have decorated initials . The page containing text of the Beatitudes in Matthew ( folio <unk> ) has a large miniature along the left margin of the page in which the letter B which begins each line is linked into an ornate chain . The genealogy of Christ found in the Gospel of Luke ( folio <unk> ) contains a similar miniature in which the word qui is repeatedly linked along the left margin . Many of the small animals scattered throughout the text serve to mark a " turn @-@ in @-@ the @-@ path " ( that is , a place where a line is finished in a space above or below the original line ) . Many other animals serve to fill spaces left at the end of lines . No two of these designs are the same . No earlier surviving manuscript has this massive amount of decoration . 
 The decorations are all high quality and often highly complex . In one decoration , which occupies a one @-@ inch square piece of a page , there are 158 complex <unk> of white ribbon with a black border on either side . Some decorations can only be fully seen with magnifying glasses , although lenses of the required power are not known to have been available until hundreds of years after the book 's completion . The complicated knot work and interweaving found in Kells and related manuscripts have many parallels in the metalwork and stone carving of the period . Since their gradual rediscovery from the 19th century on , these designs have also had an enduring popularity . Many of these motifs are used today in popular art including jewellery and tattoos . 
 = = Purpose = = 
 The book had a sacramental rather than educational purpose . Such a large , lavish Gospel would have been left on the high altar of the church and removed only for the reading of the Gospel during Mass , with the reader probably reciting from memory more than reading the text . It is significant that the Chronicles of Ulster state the book was stolen from the sacristy , where the vessels and other accoutrements of the Mass were stored , rather than from the monastic library . Its design seems to take this purpose in mind ; that is , the book was produced with appearance taking precedence over practicality . There are numerous uncorrected mistakes in the text . Lines were often completed in a blank space in the line above . The chapter headings that were necessary to make the canon tables usable were not inserted into the margins of the page . In general , nothing was done to disrupt the look of the page : aesthetics were given priority over utility .

 The 2009 animated film The Secret of Kells tells a fictional story of the creation of the Book of Kells by an elderly monk Aidan and his young apprentice Brendan , who struggle to work on the manuscript in the face of destructive Viking raids . It was directed by Tomm Moore and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2009 . It was praised for sequences of animation drawing from the illuminated pages . 
 = Harry Toulmin ( Unitarian minister ) = 
 Harry Toulmin ( sometimes called Henry Toulmin ) ( April 7 , 1766 – November 11 , 1823 ) was a Unitarian minister and politician . The son of noted Dissenting minister Joshua Toulmin , Toulmin fled his native England for the United States after he and his followers were persecuted for their beliefs . He arrived in Virginia in 1793 , and aided by recommendations from Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe , he was chosen president of Transylvania Seminary ( now Transylvania University ) in Lexington , Kentucky . His Unitarian views , however , offended many of the orthodox Presbyterian members of Transylvania 's board of regents , and Toulmin resigned after two years . 
 Shortly after his resignation , Toulmin was appointed Secretary of State of Kentucky by Governor James Garrard . He influenced Garrard – a Baptist minister – to adopt some doctrines of Socinianism , for which he was expelled from the local Baptist association , ending his ministry . As Secretary of State , Toulmin endorsed the Kentucky Resolutions and revised the state 's code of laws in conjunction with Attorney General James Blair . After the expiration of his term as Secretary of State in 1804 , Thomas Jefferson appointed him Superior Court Judge for the Tombigbee District of the Mississippi Territory . He was the first U.S. district judge to hold court on Alabama soil . As the highest @-@ ranking authority in the large territory , he tried to prevent residents in his jurisdiction from conducting raids against the Spanish in West Florida and from participating in the Creek War between two rival factions of Creek Indians . When the state of Alabama was formed from part of Toulmin 's district , he helped write the new state 's constitution and was elected to the state legislature . Again , he was asked to compile a digest of the region 's laws , which he completed in 1823 . 
 Toulmin died in Washington County , Alabama on November 11 , 1823 . Because of his work compiling the laws of several states , later historians called him the " frontier Justinian " . His grandson , Harry Theophilus Toulmin was appointed district judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama by President Grover Cleveland in 1886 . In 2005 , Toulmin was inducted into the Alabama Lawyer 's Hall of Fame , and in December 2009 he was honored with the installation of a plaque in front of the Baldwin County , Alabama , courthouse . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 Toulmin was born April 7 , 1766 , in Taunton , Somersetshire , England . His parents were Joshua Toulmin , a noted Dissenting minister , and his wife Jane ( Smith ) Toulmin . He received little formal education , but frequently read books in his mother 's bookstore and benefited from listening to conversations between his father and other noted ministers such as Joseph Priestley and Theophilus Lindsey . After attending Hoxton Academy and studying under Thomas Barnes and William Hawes , he followed his father into the ministry in 1786 . 
 During his ministry in England , Toulmin served two Dissenting congregations in Lancashire . From 1786 to 1788 , he was pastor of a church in Monton , and from 1787 to 1793 , he served another congregation at Chowbent Chapel in Atherton . He soon had nearly 1 @,@ 000 followers , Many of his followers supported the French Revolution , attracting the attention of anti @-@ dissenting partisans in England . A group of these partisans once took advantage of Toulmin 's absence to threaten his house , necessitating his swift return to protect his family . Upon arriving , he was able to break up the mob via diplomacy alone . 
 About 1787 , Toulmin married Ann Tremlett . The couple had nine children , five of whom survived infancy . In 1808 , one of these children , Lucinda Jane , married Colonel Daniel Garrard , the son of James Garrard , the second governor of Kentucky . After the death of Toulmin 's first wife , he married Martha Johnson in 1812 . They had one child together . 
 = = Resettlement in Kentucky = = 
 Spurred by the persecution endured by his followers and himself , in 1792 Toulmin published an anonymous pamphlet entitled " Thoughts on Emigration " , containing his thoughts on members of the Dissenter movement relocating to another country . The following year , his congregants raised enough money to send him to the United States to explore the possibility of relocating there . Dr. Priestly gave him letters of introduction to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to present on his arrival . During his two @-@ month voyage from England to Norfolk , Virginia , Toulmin kept a diary , which was later published under the title The Western Country in 1793 ; Reports on Kentucky and Virginia . 
 Following his arrival in the United States , Toulmin wrote letters back to England , giving potential immigrants information they would need to know for their journey ; these letters were published in the local Monthly Magazine . The following year , he published A Description of Kentucky , a pamphlet encouraging emigration from Europe to Kentucky . 
 After seeing Toulmin 's letters of recommendation from Jefferson and Madison , the board of trustees of Transylvania Seminary ( now Transylvania University ) in Lexington , Kentucky , elected him president of the seminary in February 1794 . He was the first president of the seminary who was not a Presbyterian , and his election was effected when the Baptist and more liberal members of the board united against the more conservative Presbyterian members . His Unitarian views offended many of the conservative board members , and at their insistence , the Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation requiring a unanimous vote of the board of regents to re @-@ elect the seminary 's president . Toulmin resigned in protest in April 1796 . 
 Shortly after Toulmin 's resignation , James Garrard , a Baptist minister who had supported Toulmin as a trustee of Transylvania , was elected governor of Kentucky . At first , Garrard elected to re @-@ appoint sitting Secretary of State James Brown , but when Brown retired in October 1796 , Garrard appointed Toulmin as his replacement . He served in this capacity from 1796 to 1804 , spanning both of Garrard 's consecutive terms as governor . As a result of Garrard 's relationship with Toulmin , he began to accept some tenets of Unitarianism , specifically the doctrines of Socinianism . By 1802 , Garrard and his associate Augustine Eastin had not only adopted these beliefs , but had indoctrinated their Baptist congregations with them as well . The Elkhorn Baptist Association condemned Garrard and Eastin 's beliefs as heretical and tried to persuade the two men to abandon them . When that effort failed , the Association ceased correspondence and association with both men . This event ended Garrard 's ministry and his association with the Baptist church . 
 As Secretary of State , Toulmin was signatory to the Kentucky Resolutions , the legislature 's official protest of the Alien and Sedition Acts , which he regarded as an " unwarranted government intrusion into free thought , free association , and free speech " . In 1801 , he published The Magistrate 's Assistant , a guide to the state 's magisterial laws . He also promoted public awareness of governmental activity by compiling and publishing the proceedings of the General Assembly as The Public Acts of the General Assembly . Government officials chose Toulmin and state Attorney General James Blair to revise the state 's code of laws . The results of their work – a three @-@ volume tome entitled Review of the Criminal Law of Kentucky – was published in 1806 . 
 Near the end of Governor Garrard 's term , he appointed Toulmin registrar of the state land office . Toulmin was the first of six candidates that the state senate rejected in a bitter showdown between Garrard and the legislature . The seventh candidate , John Adair was finally confirmed by the senate . 
 = = Life in Alabama = = 
 Toulmin supported President Thomas Jefferson 's re @-@ election bid in 1804 . Following his victory , Jefferson appointed Toulmin to succeed Ephraim Kirby as Superior Court Judge for the Tombigbee District of the Mississippi Territory in 1804 . Because Kirby only served six months and never held court in the present @-@ day state of Alabama , Toulmin is regarded as the first U.S. federal judge on Alabama soil . 
 Toulmin and his family relocated to Fort Stoddert , just north of the border between the United States and the Spanish territory of West Florida . Toulmin 's district was large – by his estimate , 340 miles long and 330 miles wide – and he served as minister , physician , judge , postmaster , and diplomat for the area . He published both the Mississippi Magistrate 's Guide and The Laws of Mississippi in 1807 . 
 The residents of Tombigbee District objected to Spanish control of Mobile Bay , which prevented them from accessing the Mississippi River and the port of New Orleans . In 1805 , he formally petitioned Congress to intervene , but they did not . Although he personally favored U.S. annexation of West Florida , he defended it as an independent nation until the annexation occurred . In 1807 , he arrested former Vice @-@ President Aaron Burr ; Burr had been accused of conspiring to create an independent state in the Southwest that would belong to neither the U.S. nor Spain . In 1810 , he arrested Reuben Kemper and two other members of a group styled the " Mobile Society " following an unsuccessful attempt to " liberate " Mobile and Pensacola . Toulmin 's actions were seen as supportive of Spain , and a Baldwin County grand jury charged him with acting on behalf of Spain . A congressional investigation cleared him of any wrongdoing in May 1812 . Toulmin was less successful in preventing residents of his district from entering the Creek War between to rival factions of Creek Indians . 
 In 1817 , Alabama Territory was formed from part of Mississippi Territory . When the state of Alabama was created from part of the Tombigbee District in 1819 , Toulmin was chosen to represent Baldwin County at the state 's constitutional convention in July 1819 . He served on the Committee of Fifteen that drafted the first Constitution of Alabama . The document was influenced by the Kentucky Constitution of 1800 , which contained more democratic provisions than some of the older state constitutions . 
 After the constitutional convention , he was elected to the Alabama Legislature . In 1821 , his fellow legislators chose him to write a digest of the state 's laws . The final product , Digest of the Laws of the State of Alabama , was published in 1823 . It comprised over 1 @,@ 000 pages and contained the laws of Mississippi and Alabama territories as well as the acts passed by the Alabama Legislature to date . 
 Toulmin maintained a cotton plantation in Washington County , Alabama . Although he was opposed to slavery when initially arriving in the United States , and he advocated for provisions in the Alabama Constitution that permitted the eventual emancipation of slaves , nevertheless he eventually came to be a slave owner himself . In his will , he provided for one of his slaves to be freed , deeming him " fit for freedom which few negroes are . " 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Toulmin died on his plantation on November 11 , 1823 . He is presumed to have been buried on his plantation , but the exact location of his grave is unknown . Because of his work in codifying the laws of several states and territories , later literary scholars referred to Toulmin as the " frontier Justinian " , an allusion to Byzantine Emperor Justinian I , who was known for codifying the empire 's laws . 
 One of Toulmin 's sons became a prominent state legislator in Alabama , and his grandson , Harry Theophilus Toulmin was appointed district judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama by President Grover Cleveland in 1886 . 
 The original Judge Toulmin was elected to the Alabama Lawyer 's Hall of Fame in 2005 . A plaque honoring Toulmin was placed in front of the Baldwin County , Alabama , courthouse in December 2009 .

 = Seabird = 
 Seabirds ( also known as marine birds ) are birds that are adapted to life within the marine environment . While seabirds vary greatly in lifestyle , behaviour and physiology , they often exhibit striking convergent evolution , as the same environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations . The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period , and modern seabird families emerged in the Paleogene . 
 In general , seabirds live longer , breed later and have fewer young than other birds do , but they invest a great deal of time in their young . Most species nest in colonies , which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions . Many species are famous for undertaking long annual migrations , crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases . They feed both at the ocean 's surface and below it , and even feed on each other . Seabirds can be highly pelagic , coastal , or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely . 
 Seabirds and humans have a long history together : they have provided food to hunters , guided fishermen to fishing stocks and led sailors to land . Many species are currently threatened by human activities , and conservation efforts are under way . 
 = = Classification of seabirds = = 
 There exists no single definition of which groups , families and species are seabirds , and most definitions are in some way arbitrary . In the words of two seabird scientists , " The one common characteristic that all seabirds share is that they feed in saltwater ; but , as seems to be true with any statement in biology , some do not . " However , by convention all of the Sphenisciformes and Procellariiformes , all of the Pelecaniformes except the darters , and some of the Charadriiformes ( the skuas , gulls , terns , auks and skimmers ) are classified as seabirds . The phalaropes are usually included as well , since although they are waders ( " shorebirds " in North America ) , two of the three species are oceanic for nine months of the year , crossing the equator to feed <unk> . 
 Loons and grebes , which nest on lakes but winter at sea , are usually categorized as water birds , not seabirds . Although there are a number of sea ducks in the family Anatidae that are truly marine in the winter , by convention they are usually excluded from the seabird grouping . Many waders ( or shorebirds ) and herons are also highly marine , living on the sea 's edge ( coast ) , but are also not treated as seabirds . 
 = = Evolution and fossil record = = 
 Seabirds , by virtue of living in a geologically depositional environment ( that is , in the sea where sediments are readily laid down ) , are well represented in the fossil record . They are first known to occur in the Cretaceous period , the earliest being the <unk> , like <unk> regalis , a flightless loon @-@ like seabird that could dive in a fashion similar to grebes and loons ( using its feet to move underwater ) but had a beak filled with sharp teeth . 
 While <unk> is not thought to have left descendants , the earliest modern seabirds also occurred in the Cretaceous , with a species called Tytthostonyx <unk> , which seems allied to the Procellariiformes and Pelecaniformes . In the Paleogene the seas were dominated by early Procellariidae , giant penguins and two extinct families , the Pelagornithidae and the <unk> ( a group of large seabirds that looked like the penguins ) . Modern genera began their wide radiation in the Miocene , although the genus Puffinus ( which includes today 's Manx shearwater and sooty shearwater ) might date back to the Oligocene . The highest diversity of seabirds apparently existed during the Late Miocene and the Pliocene . At the end of the latter , the oceanic food web had undergone a period of upheaval due to extinction of considerable numbers of marine species ; subsequently , the spread of marine mammals seems to have prevented seabirds from reaching their erstwhile diversity . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Adaptations to life at sea = = = 
 Seabirds have made numerous adaptations to living on and feeding in the sea . Wing morphology has been shaped by the niche an individual species or family has evolved , so that looking at a wing 's shape and loading can tell a scientist about its life feeding behaviour . Longer wings and low wing loading are typical of more pelagic species , while diving species have shorter wings . Species such as the wandering albatross , which forage over huge areas of sea , have a reduced capacity for powered flight and are dependent on a type of gliding called dynamic soaring ( where the wind deflected by waves provides lift ) as well as slope soaring . Seabirds also almost always have webbed feet , to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting diving in some species . The Procellariiformes are unusual among birds in having a strong sense of smell , which is used to find widely distributed food in a vast ocean , and possibly to locate their colonies . 
 Salt glands are used by seabirds to deal with the salt they ingest by drinking and feeding ( particularly on crustaceans ) , and to help them <unk> . The excretions from these glands ( which are positioned in the head of the birds , emerging from the nasal cavity ) are almost pure sodium chloride . 
 With the exception of the cormorants and some terns , and in common with most other birds , all seabirds have waterproof plumage . However , compared to land birds , they have far more feathers protecting their bodies . This dense plumage is better able to protect the bird from getting wet , and cold is kept out by a dense layer of down feathers . The cormorants possess a layer of unique feathers that retain a smaller layer of air ( compared to other diving birds ) but otherwise soak up water . This allows them to swim without fighting the buoyancy that retaining air in the feathers causes , yet retain enough air to prevent the bird losing excessive heat through contact with water . 
 The plumage of most seabirds is less colourful than that of land birds , restricted in the main to variations of black , white or grey . A few species sport colourful plumes ( such as the tropicbirds and some penguins ) , but most of the colour in seabirds appears in the bills and legs . The plumage of seabirds is thought in many cases to be for camouflage , both defensive ( the colour of US Navy battleships is the same as that of Antarctic prions , and in both cases it reduces visibility at sea ) and aggressive ( the white underside possessed by many seabirds helps hide them from prey below ) . 
 = = = Diet and feeding = = = 
 Seabirds evolved to exploit different food resources in the world 's seas and oceans , and to a great extent , their physiology and behaviour have been shaped by their diet . These evolutionary forces have often caused species in different families and even orders to evolve similar strategies and adaptations to the same problems , leading to remarkable convergent evolution , such as that between auks and penguins . There are four basic feeding strategies , or ecological guilds , for feeding at sea : surface feeding , pursuit diving , plunge diving and predation of higher vertebrates ; within these guilds there are multiple variations on the theme . 
 = = = = Surface feeding = = = = 
 Many seabirds feed on the ocean 's surface , as the action of marine currents often concentrates food such as krill , forage fish , squid or other prey items within reach of a dipped head . 
 Surface feeding itself can be broken up into two different approaches , surface feeding while flying ( for example as practiced by gadfly petrels , frigatebirds and storm petrels ) , and surface feeding while swimming ( examples of which are practiced by fulmars , gulls , many of the shearwaters and gadfly petrels ) . Surface feeders in flight include some of the most acrobatic of seabirds , which either snatch morsels from the water ( as do frigate @-@ birds and some terns ) , or " walk " , pattering and hovering on the water 's surface , as some of the storm @-@ petrels do . Many of these do not ever land in the water , and some , such as the frigatebirds , have difficulty getting airborne again should they do so . Another seabird family that does not land while feeding is the skimmer , which has a unique fishing method : flying along the surface with the lower mandible in the water — this shuts automatically when the bill touches something in the water . The skimmer 's bill reflects its unusual lifestyle , with the lower mandible uniquely being longer than the upper one . 
 Surface feeders that swim often have unique bills as well , adapted for their specific <unk> prions have special bills with filters called lamellae to filter out plankton from mouthfuls of water , and many albatrosses and petrels have hooked bills to snatch fast @-@ moving prey . Gulls have more generalised bills that reflect their more opportunistic lifestyle . 
 = = = = Pursuit diving = = = = 
 Pursuit diving exerts greater pressures ( both evolutionary and physiological ) on seabirds , but the reward is a greater area in which to feed than is available to surface feeders . Propulsion underwater can be provided by wings ( as used by penguins , auks , diving petrels and some other species of petrel ) or feet ( as used by cormorants , grebes , loons and several types of fish @-@ eating ducks ) . Wing @-@ propelled divers are generally faster than foot @-@ propelled divers . In both cases , the use of wings or feet for diving has limited their utility in other situations : loons and grebes walk with extreme difficulty ( if at all ) , penguins cannot fly , and auks have sacrificed flight efficiency in favour of underwater diving . For example , the razorbill ( an Atlantic auk ) requires 64 % more energy to fly than a petrel of equivalent size . Many shearwaters are intermediate between the two , having longer wings than typical wing @-@ propelled divers but heavier wing loadings than the other surface @-@ feeding procellariids , leaving them capable of diving to considerable depths while still being efficient long @-@ distance travellers . The deepest diving exhibited by shearwaters is found in the short @-@ tailed shearwater , which has been recorded diving below 70 m . Some albatross species are also capable of limited diving , with light @-@ mantled sooty albatrosses holding the record at 12 m . Of all the wing @-@ propelled pursuit divers , the most efficient in the air are the albatrosses , and they are also the poorest divers . This is the dominant guild in polar and subpolar environments , as it is energetically inefficient in warmer waters . With their poor flying ability , many wing @-@ propelled pursuit divers are more limited in their foraging range than other guilds , especially during the breeding season when hungry chicks need regular feeding . 
 = = = = Plunge diving = = = = 
 Gannets , boobies , tropicbirds , some terns and brown pelicans all engage in plunge diving , taking fast moving prey by diving into the water from flight . Plunge diving allows birds to use the energy from the momentum of the dive to combat natural buoyancy ( caused by air trapped in plumage ) , and thus uses less energy than the dedicated pursuit divers , allowing them to utilise more widely distributed food resources , for example , in impoverished tropical seas . In general , this is the most specialised method of hunting employed by seabirds ; other non @-@ specialists ( such as gulls and skuas ) may employ it but do so with less skill and from lower heights . In brown pelicans the skills of plunge diving take several years to fully develop — once mature , they can dive from 20 m ( 70 ft ) above the water 's surface , shifting the body before impact to avoid injury . It has been suggested that plunge divers are restricted in their hunting grounds to clear waters that afford a view of their prey from the air , and while they are the dominant guild in the tropics , the link between plunge diving and water clarity is inconclusive . Some plunge divers ( as well as some surface feeders ) are dependent on dolphins and tuna to push shoaling fish up towards the surface . 
 = = = = Kleptoparasitism , scavenging and predation = = = = 
 This catch @-@ all category refers to other seabird strategies that involve the next trophic level up . <unk> are seabirds that make a part of their living stealing food of other seabirds . Most famously , frigatebirds and skuas engage in this behaviour , although gulls , terns and other species will steal food opportunistically . The nocturnal nesting behaviour of some seabirds has been interpreted as arising due to pressure from this aerial piracy . Kleptoparasitism is not thought to play a significant part of the diet of any species , and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting . A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40 % of the food they needed , and on average obtained only 5 % . Many species of gull will feed on seabird and sea mammal carrion when the opportunity arises , as will giant petrels . Some species of albatross also engage in scavenging : an analysis of regurgitated squid beaks has shown that many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive , and include mid @-@ water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatrosses . Some species will also feed on other seabirds ; for example , gulls , skuas and pelicans will often take eggs , chicks and even small adult seabirds from nesting colonies , while the giant petrels can kill prey up to the size of small penguins and seal pups . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 Seabirds ' life histories are dramatically different from those of land birds . In general , they are K @-@ selected , live much longer ( anywhere between twenty and sixty years ) , delay breeding for longer ( for up to ten years ) , and invest more effort into fewer young . Most species will only have one clutch a year , unless they lose the first ( with a few exceptions , like the Cassin 's auklet ) , and many species ( like the tubenoses and sulids ) , only one egg a year . 
 Care of young is protracted , extending for as long as six months , among the longest for birds . For example , once common guillemot chicks fledge , they remain with the male parent for several months at sea . The frigatebirds have the longest period of parental care of any bird except a few raptors and the southern ground hornbill , with each chick fledging after four to six months and continued assistance after that for up to fourteen months . Due to the extended period of care , breeding occurs every two years rather than annually for some species . This life @-@ history strategy has probably evolved both in response to the challenges of living at sea ( collecting widely scattered prey items ) , the frequency of breeding failures due to unfavourable marine conditions , and the relative lack of predation compared to that of land @-@ living birds . 
 Because of the greater investment in raising the young and because foraging for food may occur far from the nest site , in all seabird species except the phalaropes , both parents participate in caring for the young , and pairs are typically at least seasonally monogamous . Many species , such as gulls , auks and penguins , retain the same mate for several seasons , and many petrel species mate for life . Albatrosses and procellariids , which mate for life , take many years to form a pair bond before they breed , and the albatrosses have an elaborate breeding dance that is part of pair @-@ bond formation . 
 = = = Breeding and colonies = = = 
 Ninety @-@ five percent of seabirds are colonial , and seabird colonies are among the largest bird colonies in the world , providing one of Earth 's great wildlife spectacles . Colonies of over a million birds have been recorded , both in the tropics ( such as Kiritimati in the Pacific ) and in the polar latitudes ( as in Antarctica ) . Seabird colonies occur exclusively for the purpose of breeding ; non @-@ breeding birds will only collect together outside the breeding season in areas where prey species are densely aggregated . 
 Seabird colonies are highly variable . Individual nesting sites can be widely spaced , as in an albatross colony , or densely packed as with a murre colony . In most seabird colonies , several different species will nest on the same colony , often exhibiting some niche separation . Seabirds can nest in trees ( if any are available ) , on the ground ( with or without nests ) , on cliffs , in burrows under the ground and in rocky crevices . Competition can be strong both within species and between species , with aggressive species such as sooty terns pushing less dominant species out of the most desirable nesting spaces . The tropical Bonin petrel nests during the winter to avoid competition with the more aggressive wedge @-@ tailed shearwater . When the seasons overlap , the wedge @-@ tailed shearwaters will kill young Bonin petrels in order to use their burrows . 
 Many seabirds show remarkable site fidelity , returning to the same burrow , nest or site for many years , and they will defend that site from rivals with great vigour . This increases breeding success , provides a place for returning mates to reunite , and reduces the costs of prospecting for a new site . Young adults breeding for the first time usually return to their natal colony , and often nest close to where they hatched . This tendency , known as philopatry , is so strong that a study of Laysan albatrosses found that the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was 22 m ; another study , this time on Cory 's shearwaters nesting near Corsica , found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony bred in the burrow they were raised in , and two actually bred with their own mother . 
 Colonies are usually situated on islands , cliffs or headlands , which land mammals have difficulty accessing . This is thought to provide protection to seabirds , which are often very clumsy on land . <unk> often arises in types of bird that do not defend feeding territories ( such as swifts , which have a very variable prey source ) ; this may be a reason why it arises more frequently in seabirds . There are other possible advantages : colonies may act as information centres , where seabirds returning to the sea to forage can find out where prey is by studying returning individuals of the same species . There are disadvantages to colonial life , particularly the spread of disease . Colonies also attract the attention of predators , principally other birds , and many species attend their colonies nocturnally to avoid predation . 
 = = = Migration = = = 
 Like many birds , seabirds often migrate after the breeding season . Of these , the trip taken by the Arctic tern is the farthest of any bird , crossing the equator in order to spend the Austral summer in Antarctica . Other species also undertake trans @-@ equatorial trips , both from the north to the south , and from south to north . The population of elegant terns , which nest off Baja California , splits after the breeding season with some birds travelling north to the Central Coast of California and some travelling as far south as Peru and Chile to feed in the Humboldt Current . The sooty shearwater undertakes an annual migration cycle that rivals that of the Arctic tern ; birds that nest in New Zealand and Chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the North Pacific off Japan , Alaska and California , an annual round trip of 40 @,@ 000 statute miles ( 64 @,@ 000 km ) . 
 Other species also migrate shorter distances away from the breeding sites , their distribution at sea determined by the availability of food . If oceanic conditions are unsuitable , seabirds will emigrate to more productive areas , sometimes permanently if the bird is young . After fledging , juvenile birds often disperse further than adults , and to different areas , so are commonly sighted far from a species ' normal range . Some species , such as the auks , do not have a concerted migration effort , but drift southwards as the winter approaches . Other species , such as some of the storm petrels , diving petrels and cormorants , never disperse at all , staying near their breeding colonies year round . 
 = = = Away from the sea = = = 
 While the definition of seabirds suggests that the birds in question spend their lives on the ocean , many seabird families have many species that spend some or even most of their lives inland away from the sea . Most strikingly , many species breed many tens , hundreds or even thousands of miles inland . Some of these species still return to the ocean to feed ; for example , the snow petrel , the nests of which have been found 480 kilometres ( 300 mi ) inland on the Antarctic mainland , are unlikely to find anything to eat around their breeding sites . The marbled murrelet nests inland in old growth forest , seeking huge conifers with large branches to nest on . Other species , such as the California gull , nest and feed inland on lakes , and then move to the coasts in the winter . Some cormorant , pelican , gull and tern species have individuals that never visit the sea at all , spending their lives on lakes , rivers , swamps and , in the case of some of the gulls , cities and agricultural land . In these cases it is thought that these terrestrial or freshwater birds evolved from marine ancestors . Some seabirds , principally those that nest in tundra , as skuas and phalaropes do , will migrate over land as well . 
 The more marine species , such as petrels , auks and gannets , are more restricted in their habits , but are occasionally seen inland as vagrants . This most commonly happens to young inexperienced birds , but can happen in great numbers to exhausted adults after large storms , an event known as a wreck , where they provide prized sightings for birders . 
 = = Relationship with humans = = 
 = = = Seabirds and fisheries = = = 
 Seabirds have had a long association with both fisheries and sailors , and both have drawn benefits and disadvantages from the relationship . 
 Fishermen have traditionally used seabirds as indicators of both fish shoals , underwater banks that might indicate fish stocks , and of potential landfall . In fact , the known association of seabirds with land was instrumental in allowing the Polynesians to locate tiny landmasses in the Pacific . Seabirds have provided food for fishermen away from home , as well as bait . Famously , tethered cormorants have been used to catch fish directly . Indirectly , fisheries have also benefited from guano from colonies of seabirds acting as fertilizer for the surrounding seas . 
 Negative effects on fisheries are mostly restricted to raiding by birds on aquaculture , although long @-@ lining fisheries also have to deal with bait stealing . There have been claims of prey depletion by seabirds of fishery stocks , and while there is some evidence of this , the effects of seabirds are considered smaller than that of marine mammals and predatory fish ( like tuna ) . 
 Some seabird species have benefited from fisheries , particularly from discarded fish and offal . These discards compose 30 % of the food of seabirds in the North Sea , for example , and compose up to 70 % of the total food of some seabird populations . This can have other impacts ; for example , the spread of the northern fulmar through the United Kingdom is attributed in part to the availability of discards . <unk> generally benefit surface feeders , such as gannets and petrels , to the detriment of pursuit divers like penguins . 
 Fisheries also have negative effects on seabirds , and these effects , particularly on the long @-@ lived and slow @-@ breeding albatrosses , are a source of increasing concern to conservationists . The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a big impact on seabird numbers ; for example , an estimated 100 @,@ 000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long @-@ line fisheries . Overall , many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year , a source of concern for some of the rarest species ( for example , only about 2 @,@ 000 short @-@ tailed albatrosses are known to still exist ) . Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs . 
 = = = Exploitation = = = 
 The hunting of seabirds and the collecting of seabird eggs have contributed to the declines of many species , and the extinction of several , including the great auk and the spectacled cormorant . Seabirds have been hunted for food by coastal peoples throughout history — one of the earliest instances known is in southern Chile , where archaeological excavations in middens has shown hunting of albatrosses , cormorants and shearwaters from 5000 BP . This pressure has led to some species becoming extinct in many places ; in particular , at least 20 species of an original 29 no longer breed on Easter Island . In the 19th century , the hunting of seabirds for fat deposits and feathers for the millinery trade reached industrial levels . <unk> ( harvesting shearwater chicks ) developed as important industries in both New Zealand and Tasmania , and the name of one species , the providence petrel , is derived from its seemingly miraculous arrival on Norfolk Island where it provided a windfall for starving European settlers . In the Falkland Islands , hundreds of thousands of penguins were harvested for their oil each year . Seabird eggs have also long been an important source of food for sailors undertaking long sea voyages , as well as being taken when settlements grow in areas near a colony . Eggers from San Francisco took almost half a million eggs a year from the Farallon Islands in the mid @-@ 19th century , a period in the islands ' history from which the seabird species are still recovering . 
 Both hunting and egging continue today , although not at the levels that occurred in the past , and generally in a more controlled manner . For example , the Māori of Stewart Island / Rakiura continue to harvest the chicks of the sooty shearwater as they have done for centuries , using traditional methods ( called <unk> ) to manage the harvest , but now work with the University of Otago in studying the populations . In Greenland , however , uncontrolled hunting is pushing many species into steep decline . 
 = = = Other threats = = = 
 Other human factors have led to declines and even extinctions in seabird populations , colonies and species . Of these , perhaps the most serious are introduced species . Seabirds , breeding predominantly on small isolated islands , have lost many predator defence behaviours . Feral cats are capable of taking seabirds as large as albatrosses , and many introduced rodents , such as the Pacific rat , can take eggs hidden in burrows . Introduced goats , cattle , rabbits and other herbivores can lead to problems , particularly when species need vegetation to protect or shade their young . Disturbance of breeding colonies by humans is often a problem as well — visitors , even well @-@ meaning tourists , can flush brooding adults off a colony leaving chicks and eggs vulnerable to predators . 
 The build @-@ up of toxins and pollutants in seabirds is also a concern . Seabirds , being apex predators , suffered from the ravages of DDT until it was banned ; among other effects , DDT was implicated in embryo development problems and the skewed sex ratio of western gulls in southern California . Oil spills are also a threat to seabird species , as both a toxin and because the feathers of the birds become saturated by the oil , causing them to lose their waterproofing . Oil pollution threatens species with restricted ranges or already depressed populations . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 The threats faced by seabirds have not gone unnoticed by scientists or the conservation movement . As early as 1903 , U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was convinced of the need to declare Pelican Island in Florida a National Wildlife Refuge to protect the bird colonies ( including the nesting brown pelicans ) , and in 1909 he protected the Farallon Islands . Today many important seabird colonies are given some measure of protection , from Heron Island in Australia to Triangle Island in British Columbia . 
 Island restoration techniques , pioneered by New Zealand , enable the removal of exotic invaders from increasingly large islands . Feral cats have been removed from Ascension Island , Arctic foxes from many islands in the Aleutian Islands , and rats from Campbell Island . The removal of these introduced species has led to increases in numbers of species under pressure and even the return of extirpated ones . After the removal of cats from Ascension Island , seabirds began to nest there again for the first time in over a hundred years . 
 Seabird mortality caused by long @-@ line fisheries can be greatly reduced by techniques such as setting long @-@ line bait at night , dying the bait blue , setting the bait underwater , increasing the amount of weight on lines and by using bird scarers , and their deployment is increasingly required by many national fishing fleets . The international ban on the use of drift nets has also helped reduce the mortality of seabirds and other marine wildlife . 
 One of the Millennium Projects in the UK was the Scottish Seabird Centre , near the important bird sanctuaries on Bass Rock , Fidra and the surrounding islands . The area is home to huge colonies of gannets , puffins , skuas and other seabirds . The centre allows visitors to watch live video from the islands as well as learn about the threats the birds face and how we can protect them , and has helped to significantly raise the profile of seabird conservation in the UK . Seabird tourism can provide income for coastal communities as well as raise the profile of seabird conservation . For example , the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in New Zealand attracts 40 @,@ 000 visitors a year . 
 The plight of albatross and large seabirds , as well as other marine creatures , being taken as bycatch by long @-@ line fisheries , has been addressed by a large number of non @-@ governmental organizations ( including BirdLife International , the American Bird Conservancy and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ) . This led to the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels , a legally binding treaty designed to protect these threatened species , which has been ratified by eleven countries as of 2008 ( namely Argentina , Australia , Chile , Ecuador , France , New Zealand , Norway , Peru , South Africa , Spain and the United Kingdom ) . 
 = = = Role in culture = = = 
 Many seabirds are little studied and poorly known , due to living far out to sea and breeding in isolated colonies . However , some seabirds , particularly , the albatrosses and gulls , have broken into popular consciousness . The albatrosses have been described as " the most legendary of birds " , and have a variety of myths and legends associated with them , and today it is widely considered unlucky to harm them , although the notion that sailors believed that is a myth that derives from Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's famous poem , " The Rime of the Ancient Mariner " , in which a sailor is punished for killing an albatross by having to wear its corpse around his neck . 
 Instead of the Cross the <unk> my neck was hung 
 Sailors did , however , consider it unlucky to touch a storm petrel , especially one that has landed on the ship . 
 Gulls are one of the most commonly seen seabirds , given their use of human @-@ made habitats ( such as cities and dumps ) and their often fearless nature . They therefore also have made it into the popular consciousness – they have been used metaphorically , as in Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach , or to denote a closeness to the sea , such as their use in The Lord of the Rings – both in the insignia of Gondor and therefore Númenor ( used in the design of the films ) , and to call Legolas to ( and across ) the sea . Other species have also made an impact ; pelicans have long been associated with mercy and altruism because of an early Western Christian myth that they split open their breast to feed their starving chicks .

 = The Witch Way = 
 The Witch Way is the branding for long @-@ standing English bus route X43 , which runs between Nelson and Manchester . The service is currently operated by Transdev in Burnley & Pendle . 
 The route has operated continuously since 1948 . It was previously operated by Ribble Motor Services , Stagecoach North West and Burnley & Pendle , while GM Buses briefly competed with Stagecoach on the route . During its history it has served several places no longer on the present route , including Bury , Colne , Skipton and the Trafford Centre . ( Transdev extended the route to Skipton once again in Spring 2016 ) . 
 The service was rebranded as The Witch Way in 2005 to coincide with the introduction of new vehicles . It had previously been branded as The X43 and before then was unbranded . Between 1982 and 1986 the route was known as Timesaver , with buses carrying dedicated liveries . 
 = = History = = 
 Route X43 was introduced between Colne and Manchester by Ribble Motor Services in 1948 , replacing another route between Burnley and Manchester . In the early 1950s it was extended to start from Skipton . In 1978 , the route was rerouted to use the new M66 motorway , bypassing Bury . Some journeys continued to serve the traditional route , as route number 743 . 
 Ribble Motor Services was privatised in 1986 in a management buyout . In April 1989 it was sold to Stagecoach . In 1992 , in response to competition on route 192 , GM Buses used its <unk> coaching subsidiary to compete with route X43 between Manchester and Burnley . The competition ended in 1994 following Stagecoach 's withdrawal from route 192 . Stagecoach went on to acquire the southern half of GM Buses in February 1996 . 
 For a short time in the late 1990s , the route operated through to Keighley , this ceased in 1999 . In 1998 the route was extended south of Manchester to the Trafford Centre . A further change in 2000 saw the northern end of route X43 rerouted to avoid <unk> , prompting some criticism from local residents . 
 Stagecoach 's operations in the Burnley area were sold to the Blazefield Group on 15 April 2001 and rebranded as Burnley & <unk> June 2001 one X43 journey in each direction was extended through to Skipton and Hawes on summer Sundays . This proved relatively successful , and the single @-@ deck coach initially used was replaced by a double @-@ decker . It continued to operate into 2003 , but was withdrawn at the end of September . Fares on the route increased by 30 % in the two years up to August 2004 , prompting some passengers to abandon the route in favour of a car sharing scheme . Despite this , the route saw an average of 12 % yearly growth between 2001 and 2004 . 
 In August 2005 , the route was upgraded with new vehicles and rebranded as The Witch Way . The service frequency was increased to every 20 minutes , with a Saturday frequency of every 30 minutes and a Sunday frequency of one bus per hour , while the extension to the Trafford Centre was withdrawn . The section of route between Nelson and Colne was also abandoned , prompting criticism from local councillors , although the parallel " Mainline " routes 20 @-@ 29 were increased in frequency to partially replace these journeys . 
 Blazefield was sold to Transdev in January 2006 . During the first six months after the new vehicles were introduced , passenger numbers on the remaining section of route increased by 24 @.@ 1 % , with total passenger numbers up by 16 @.@ 1 % . The route was shortlisted for a UK Bus Award in October 2006 , going on to win the Viacom Outdoor Bus Marketing Campaign of the Year award . 
 In October 2011 , the Witch Way services underwent a revamp with an increase of journeys between Burnley and Manchester , running every 15 minutes Monday @-@ Saturday daytime , but with a reduction of journeys between Nelson and Manchester , running every 30 minutes Monday @-@ Saturday daytime . Route <unk> , which differed from the regular route by additionally serving Edenfield , was also withdrawn from service , being partly replaced by route X8 , which ran between Burnley , Rawtenstall and Manchester via Bacup , and First Greater Manchester 's route <unk> , which was extended from Stubbins . 
 On 1 November 2013 , all buses were replaced with Volvo B9TL 's which received a new Black , white and grey livery . These buses currently serve the X43 . 
 On May 1st 2016 the route will see further changes with : 
 faster buses introduced at peak time between Manchester and Burnley 
 2 buses an hour will continue beyond Burnley to Skipton via the <unk> and Colne 
 Nelson will no longer be served by Off Peak X43 buses 
 The 872 number will be dropped in favour of the X43 - All buses to Skipton / Grassington will start in Manchester 
 = = Route description = = 
 Route X43 currently runs between Nelson and Manchester , serving the intermediate communities of Burnley , Rawtenstall and Prestwich . The service make use of both the M60 and M66 motorways . The routes also connect three notable educational establishments : Alder Grange Community and Technology School , Burnley College and Nelson and Colne College . Another point of interest on the route is the Singing Ringing Tree near Burnley . 
 On Sundays , there are 7 journeys continuing on from Burnley towards Grassington via Skipton as the <unk> service 872 , and 7 return journeys from Grassington towards Burnley from where the normal X43 Sunday service towards Manchester continues . From May 1st 2016 all 872 journeys will be operated as the X43 and will start / end at Manchester . 
 = = Vehicles and marketing = = 
 Route X43 was initially served with a mixture of double @-@ deck Leyland Titans and single @-@ deck Leyland Tigers . In the early 1960s these were replaced by new Leyland Leopards . From 1974 coaches were used on the route , with Leyland Leopards again the preferred choice . In 1982 a small number were branded for the route , using the name Timesaver and the tagline Regular Motorway service . 
 In 1984 the route was converted to double @-@ deck operation using new Leyland Olympians painted in a unique white and blue livery with Timesaver branding . Four Leyland Tiger coaches in a yellow and red livery also using the Timesaver name , arrived a year later . The route branding was replaced by Stagecoach 's corporate image of white with red , orange and blue stripes following their takeover of Ribble Motor Services in 1989 . 
 New Dennis Javelin coaches were introduced to route X43 by Stagecoach in response to the competition from <unk> in 1992 . The route was marketed as The Mancunian , with the vehicles carrying the name alongside Stagecoach corporate livery . The route was briefly operated with articulated coaches in 1996 , but this proved short @-@ lived owing to restrictions on their use in Rawtenstall , with services returning to Javelin operation . 
 The Javelins were transferred away from the route shortly prior to Stagecoach 's sale of the operation to Transdev , and the service was briefly operated with 15 @-@ year @-@ old Leyland Olympians . In July 2001 a fleet of 15 new Volvo B7TLs , which included improved interiors and CCTV cameras , were introduced to the route . 
 In August 2005 , the route was again re @-@ launched , with 16 new Wright Eclipse Gemini bodied Volvo B7TLs , again with unusual features including CCTV and leather seats . The new service took the branding " The Witch Way " , with buses named after the Pendle witches from the 17th century , and was advertised with the slogan " business class as standard " . The older B7TLs were displaced to Lancashire United 's routes <unk> and <unk> . 
 On the 1st of November 2013 new vehicles were introduced to the route , in the form of 15 Wright Gemini bodied Volvo <unk> . The buses carry a new silver livery which also features a new witch design . Additionally , free WiFi is featured to allow passengers to remain connected on their journey . 
 = = Variants = = 
 There has been five alternative routes similar to route X43 operated in the past . When route X43 was diverted away from Bury in 1978 , some journeys continued to serve the town . These were numbered 743 and were operated by Ribble Motor Services with a mixture of coaches and buses . Route X43 's infrequent extension to Skipton was also transferred onto route 743 . The route was withdrawn in 1985 due to a fall in passenger numbers which coincided with the rebranding of the main route as Timesaver . 
 Route <unk> took a different route between Burnley and Rawtenstall , via Water and <unk> in the upper Irwell Valley . In the early 1960s these journeys were 4 @-@ hourly and started / ended at Burnley . By the 1970s frequency had declined to a southbound morning and northbound evening peak working , but it survived to be renumbered 753 when X43 became 743 . It was withdrawn along with the 743 . 
 A variation of the route operating via the Rossendale Valley between Rawtenstall and Burnley was introduced in 2002 , taking the number <unk> . It was operated with route branded Volvo B10M coaches , but was cancelled after a year because of low patronage . In early 2002 , route X43 journeys which extended beyond Manchester to the Trafford Centre were renumbered to <unk> to distinguish them from the short workings . This pattern continued until the August 2005 rebranding , when the extension was withdrawn . The most recent variation was route <unk> , which ran until October 2011 . It ran via Edenfield between Rawtenstall and the M66 motorway . This allowed commuters and shoppers to travel to / from Manchester with the service running several journeys during the day Mondays to Saturdays . The service was partly replaced by route X8 , which operated two weekday journeys to Manchester and four weekday journeys from Manchester , leaving Edenfield without a weekend service to Manchester . Route X8 has since been withdrawn .

 In November 1999 , a bus travelling on the route from Manchester to <unk> was involved in a crash with a car travelling in the opposite direction in <unk> . Four passengers and the car driver suffered minor injuries . 
 In September 2006 , the driver of an X43 on the M60 motorway fell unconscious while the vehicle was moving . Irene King , a 47 @-@ year @-@ old passenger , was able to take over control of the bus to prevent a serious accident . She won several awards for this action , including an award for Outstanding Bravery at the 2006 Pride of Britain Awards , a Vodafone Life Savers Award , a Royal Humane Society Testimonial on Vellum , a Chief Constable 's Commendation . 
 = The Walk ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " The Walk " is the seventh episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It was written by John Shiban and directed by Rob Bowman . The episode aired in the United States on November 10 , 1995 on the Fox network . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , a stand @-@ alone plot which is unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " The Walk " earned a Nielsen household rating of 10 @.@ 4 , being watched by 15 @.@ 91 million people in its initial broadcast . Critical reception was mixed . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , a failed suicide attempt by a patient in a U.S. Army hospital interests Mulder with the talk of a " phantom soldier " who has prevented the man 's death . The U.S. Army General in charge of the hospital is initially opposed to the FBI 's involvement until the invisible killer begins stalking him . Everyone involved in the case is shocked to learn that the primary suspect could in fact , be a quadruple amputee . 
 " The Walk " is the first X @-@ Files script by John Shiban , who commented that it was a challenge for him . He was inspired by the film The Men , which features a character who has lost his legs in war and wishes to be able to walk again . The episode required several visual effects which were almost not completed in time . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At a VA hospital in Fort Evanston , Maryland , Lieutenant Colonel Victor Stans makes his third suicide attempt ; he claims that a mysterious figure will not let him die . Stans attempts to drown in a tub of scalding water , but is rescued by the hospital staff and subsequently is disfigured due to the hot water . 
 When Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) question Stans , they learn that his wife and children died in a house fire he claims was started by the mysterious soldier he says will not allow him to die himself . Captain Janet Draper stops the questioning , as Mulder and Scully were not granted permission to see Stans by his superior officer , General Thomas Callahan . After meeting with the agents , Callahan glimpses the phantom soldier Stans described . He also finds his answering machine replaying an unintelligible message . Later , while using the base 's swimming pool , Draper is killed by an invisible force . 
 Callahan tells the agents about the soldier and the voicemail , which was received twice before at his home . When they visit his house , his young son , Trevor , believes he saw someone go inside ; Scully herself glimpses someone in the backyard . Fingerprints are found on the property which belong to the hospital mailman , Quinton " Roach " Freely . As Mulder and Scully take Roach into custody , Trevor is attacked and killed by the invisible force in his sandbox . Under the agent 's questioning , Roach admits to his role in the deaths and states he is " Rappo 's mailman " . 
 " Rappo " turns out to be Leonard Trimble ( Ian Tracey ) , a Gulf War veteran and quadruple amputee . Scully doesn 't believe Roach , even though he insists that Rappo will kill him next . Scully later finds Roach dead in his cell with a bedsheet shoved down his throat . Scully assumes that he committed suicide , but Mulder shows her X @-@ ray dental plates he had carried in the rehab room , the pool , Callahan 's office , and Callahan 's house ; all show signs of radiation . Mulder thinks that Rappo is leaving his body through astral projection , doing so with a psychic connection forged through Roach 's letters . He also plays the voicemail backwards ; it is actually a warning from the phantom soldier . 
 Under questioning , an embittered Rappo states his belief that the Gulf War took his life away . Meanwhile , Callahan finds his wife 's dead body . He goes to the hospital to talk to Stans , who reveals that Rappo — whom he doesn 't know — is responsible for the deaths . When Callahan confronts Rappo , he openly admits his crimes . Rappo tries to goad Callahan to killing him , but Callahan decides to " stand down , " shooting over Rappo 's head . The agents arrive and find Rappo in a trance ; Mulder realizes what is happening and tries to find Callahan . Rappo 's apparition attacks Callahan with steam from the pipes in the hospital 's basement . Stans enters Rappo 's room , locks the door , and smothers Rappo with a pillow . With Rappo dead , his apparition disappears before it attacks Mulder . Callahan remains unharmed . 
 Since there is no physical evidence to prove that Rappo killed Callahan 's wife and son , the case remains unsolved . Mulder 's narration states that Rappo 's family tries to have him buried at Arlington National Cemetery ; he is instead buried in a civilian cemetery in Pennsylvania .

 " The Walk " is the first X @-@ Files script by John Shiban . He found it challenging to write , particularly Mulder and Scully 's first scene where " they have to come together on a case , yet they have to be at odds " . Shiban was inspired by the film The Men and realizing that the main character , who had been injured in war and lost his legs , wanted to walk more than anything . He stated that the paranormal concept of astral projection " just sort of fit " . Some members of the writing staff were concerned about killing Callahan 's young son , Trevor , but Shiban was not bothered by it and felt that Rappo wanted to take everything from Callahan , and the worst blow would be to kill his son . 
 Director Rob Bowman felt that Ian Tracey , who played Rappo , was " an incredibly strong actor " and fit the role . <unk> Hayes , who played an army psychiatrist in this episode , previously appeared as a CIA operative in the first season episode " Shadows " . Draper 's drowning was achieved by pulling actress Nancy Sorel down with a cable that was attached to the bottom of the pool . The image of the wave launching over Draper in the pool was accomplished by the teamwork of special effects department members Mat Beck and David Gauthier . One of the crew members was also buried in sand in the scene where Trevor is killed . The effect in the climax when Rappo 's apparition throws Callahan and Mulder across the room was accomplished with a device called the " Air @-@ Ram " that uses compressed air . The visual effects were almost not completed in time .

 " The Walk " was first broadcast on the Fox network on November 10 , 1995 . It earned a Nielsen rating of 10 @.@ 4 , with an 18 share , meaning that roughly 10 @.@ 4 percent of all television @-@ equipped households , and 18 percent of households watching television , were tuned in to the episode . It was watched by a total of 15 @.@ 91 million viewers . 
 In a retrospective of the third season by Entertainment Weekly , " The Walk " was given a grade of C , noting its similarities to other episodes and being critical of the characters . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave it a grade of B , describing it as " straightforward " , with a " well @-@ realized " military hospital and " terrific " directing . However , he felt that Ian Tracey was not a good enough actor to make Rappo 's motives seem believable . Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode two and a half stars out of four , calling it a " solid episode " with a good supporting cast and effects . However , she felt the characterization of Mulder and Scully was " off @-@ balance " and noted that some of the military detail was wrong . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode three and a half stars out of five , noting its similarities to other episodes such as the previous " 2Shy " , but felt that Shiban " has put real blood and passion into it which raises it high above the trappings of its clichés " . They criticized the plot for being too predictable and formulaic , but said it succeeded in emotion and was " well @-@ written " and " well @-@ directed " . 
 = Yes ! I Am a Long Way from Home = 
 " Yes ! I Am a Long Way from Home " is the opening track on the Scottish post @-@ rock band Mogwai 's 1997 debut album , Mogwai Young Team . It was primarily composed by the band 's bassist , Dominic Aitchison , prior to the 1997 Mogwai Young Team recording sessions . 
 The song features electric guitar , bass guitar , drum kit , organ , and glockenspiel , bookended by sampled monologues from friends of the band . It is an example of the predominantly electric guitar @-@ based genre the band employed at the time ; featuring quiet , clean sections contrasting with loud , distorted sections , sometimes connected with crescendos and <unk> . This dynamic contrast was referred to by the band as " serious guitar music . " 
 " Yes ! I Am a Long Way from Home " received a positive reception from music journalists , with album reviews focusing mainly on the effectiveness of the dynamic contrast featured within the song , the band 's usage of instrumentation , and the track 's overall representation of the band 's genre at the time . 
 = = Origins and recording = = 
 The first live performance documented of " Yes ! I Am a Long Way from Home " was on 6 April 1997 at Highbury Garage in London — the band 's first show promoting the Ten Rapid ( Collected Recordings 1996 – 1997 ) compilation album . This performance , as well as several other performances of the track throughout 1997 , was instrumental . During this period , " Yes ! I Am a Long Way from Home " sometimes went under the title of " New Dom " . 
 The song took its title from an exclamation from Lee Cohen , a Chicagoan friend of the band , at Brighton in May 1997 . The band recorded " Yes ! I Am a Long Way from Home " during the Mogwai Young Team sessions from July to August 1997 at MCM Studios in Hamilton , South Lanarkshire , Scotland , where the band had previously recorded the majority of their earlier material . The song was produced by Mogwai and Paul Savage , who handled production and mixing duties on the bulk of the band 's previous recordings . 
 = = Musical composition = = 
 " Yes ! I Am a Long Way from Home " is 5 minutes 58 seconds long , in the key of A major , in 4 / 4 time . 
 The song begins with an organ pedal point of an A note , accompanied by a recording of a monologue passage from a Bergen Student Newspaper , being recited by Mari Myren , referring to when Mogwai played a show on 15 March 1997 at the Hulen , in Bergen , Norway . Myren describes the band 's music as " bigger than words and wider than pictures " and states that " If the stars had a sound , it would sound like this . " The sound of clapping is heard , followed at ( 0 : 54 ) , by a bassline . This is joined at ( 1 : 09 ) by a soft drumbeat and a clean , two @-@ note guitar melody , based around the chord of A major . At ( 1 : 31 ) , the guitars and bass guitar modulate to the relative minor chord , F ♯ minor , and D major , and play alternate melody , before returning to the main melody . 
 This is repeated until ( 2 : 32 ) , when the drumbeat gradually fades out , leaving only the ride cymbal keeping the beat , and the guitars , which repeat a melody based around the chord of A major , using harmonics . At ( 3 : 11 ) , the bass guitar joins in , followed by the drum kit , building to a gradual crescendo , eventually climaxing at ( 3 : 42 ) into a distortion @-@ laden chord progression , using the chords F ♯ minor , D major , and A major . At ( 3 : 46 ) , a guitar solo is played over these chords . This continues until ( 5 : 09 ) , after all instruments have faded out except for the tremolo @-@ laden feedback of the guitar . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 During professional reviews , " Yes ! I Am a Long Way from Home " received largely positive reception . Ian Mathers of Stylus Magazine described the song as " gorgeous , moving from a gentle beginning to a series of shattering crescendos " , also noting that it " describes almost all of Mogwai ’ s music at this stage of their career . " David Wilson of The Daily Nebraskan described the song as having " low @-@ key harmonics and [ a ] delicate melody " , followed by " a blistering shard of explosive distortion [ bursting ] out of nowhere " , noting that the dynamic contrast within the song , " sets the seesaw pace for the whole record . " 
 Lee Harvey of Vox also referred to the dynamic contrast , noting that it " [ goads ] and [ entices ] you with gentle percussion , leaving you helpless before the surge of sky @-@ swallowing guitars that follows " . Scott Irvine of <unk> described it as a " standout track " , also noting " [ the ] track alone is worth checking out 1997 ’ s best bet for an instrumental tour de force " .
