 In the second half of the 19th century industrialisation came into full effect and a number of new industries emerged around production and refinement of agricultural products , especially oil and butter . Many companies from this time would come to leave permanent iconic marks on Aarhus . The Ceres Brewery was established in 1856 and served as Aarhus ' local brewery for more than 150 years , gradually expanding into an industrial district known as Ceres @-@ <unk> ( lit . : the Ceres @-@ grounds ) . In 1896 local farmers and businessmen created <unk> og <unk> <unk> ( KFK ) , focused on grain and feedstuffs . KFK established departments all over the country , while its headquarters remained in Aarhus where its large grain silos still stand today . Otto <unk> created the Danish Preserved Butter Company in 1874 , focusing on butter export to England , China and Africa and later founded the Aarhus <unk> Company in 1883 , the first Danish margarine factory . The industry became an important employer , with factory employees increasing from 100 in 1896 to 1 @,@ 000 in 1931 , effectively transforming the city from a regional trade hub into an industrial centre . Other new factories of note include the dockyard of <unk> and the oil mill of Århus <unk> , both located at the harbour , and <unk> , a machine factory initiated in 1854 . 
 Aarhus became the largest provincial city in the country by the turn of the century and the city marketed itself as the " Capital of Jutland " . The population increased from 15 @,@ 000 in 1870 to 52 @,@ 000 in 1901 and in response the city annexed large land areas to develop new residential quarters such as <unk> , Frederiksbjerg and Marselisborg . Many of its cultural institutions were also established at this time such as the Aarhus Theatre ( 1900 ) , the national library ( 1902 ) , Aarhus University ( 1928 ) and several hospitals .

 On 9 April 1940 , Germany invaded Denmark , occupying Aarhus the following day and 5 years hence . The occupation was a destructive period with major disasters , loss of life and economic depression . The Port of Aarhus became a hub for supplies to the Baltics and Norway while the surrounding rail network supplied the Atlantic Wall in west Jutland and cargo headed for Germany . Combined , these factors resulted in a strong German presence , especially in 1944 @-@ 45 . The first years were peaceful in conjunction with the policies of the Danish Protectorate Government , but following the enactment of the Communist Law in August 1941 , the first armed resistance and sabotage commenced , gradually growing in intensity over the years with repression and terror in response . 
 Small , independent resistance groups first appeared in 1941 @-@ 42 but the first to coordinate with the Freedom Council was the <unk> Group , responsible for most operations from early 1943 . The <unk> group , along with others in and around Aarhus , was dismantled in June 1944 when Grethe " Thora " Bartram turned her family and acquaintances over to German authorities . In response , requests for assistance was sent to contacts in England and in October 1944 the Royal Air Force bombed the Gestapo headquarters successfully destroying archives and obstructing the ongoing investigation . The 5 <unk> group was established with assistance from Holger Danske to restore a resistance movement in Aarhus along with the L @-@ groups , tasked with assassinating collaborators . Resistance operations escalated from mid @-@ 1944 with most major sabotage operations and assassinations occurring in the period 1944 @-@ 45 . The growing resistance was countered with 19 <unk> terror operations by the Peter Group from August 1944 , including large @-@ scale fire bombings and murders . The increasingly destructive occupation was compounded when an ammunition barge exploded in 1944 , destroying much of the harbor and damaging the inner city . On 5 May 1945 German forces in Denmark surrendered but during the transitional period fighting broke out in Aarhus between the resistance and German soldiers resulting in 22 dead . Order was restored by the end of the day and on 8 May the British Royal Dragoons entered the city . 
 = = = Post @-@ World War II years = = = 
 In the 1980s the city entered a period of rapid growth and the service sector overtook trade , industry and crafts as the leading sector of employment for the first time . Workers gradually began commuting to the city from most of east and central Jutland as the region became more interconnected . The student population tripled between 1965 and 1977 turning the city into a Danish centre of research and education . The growing and comparably young population initiated a period of creativity and optimism ; Gaffa and the <unk> school were founded in 1983 and 1991 respectively , and Aarhus was at the centre of a renaissance in Danish rock and pop music launching bands and musicians such as TV2 , Gnags , Thomas Helmig , <unk> Venner , Anne <unk> Michelsen , Mek Pek and Shit & Chanel . 
 Since the turn of the millennium both skyline and land use has changed as former industrial sites are being redeveloped into new city districts . Starting in 2007 , the former docklands are being converted to a new mixed use district dubbed " Aarhus Ø " ( Aarhus Docklands ) . The site of the former Royal <unk> Ceres breweries began redevelopment in 2012 into " <unk> " , a residential district with educational institutions . The former DSB repair facilities at Frederiks Plads have been demolished and are being developed into a new business district with high @-@ rise buildings scheduled for completion in 2017 . The main bus terminal is planned to be moved to the central railway station by 2018 and the current site will be made into a new residential district . Construction of the first light rail system in the city commenced in 2013 , with the first increment to be finished in 2017 . The light rail system is planned to eventually tie many of the suburbs closer to central Aarhus . The next phase will connect a large planned suburb west of <unk> . 
 Accelerating growth since the early 2000s brought the inner urban area to roughly 260 @,@ 000 inhabitants by 2014 . The rapid growth is expected to continue until at least 2030 when Aarhus municipality has set an ambitious target for 375 @,@ 000 inhabitants . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Aarhus is located at the Bay of Aarhus facing the Kattegat sea in the east with the peninsulas of Mols and <unk> across the bay to the northeast . Mols and <unk> are both part of the larger regional peninsula of <unk> . A number of larger cities and towns is within easy reach from Aarhus by road and rail , including Randers ( 38 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 23 @.@ 9 mi ) by road north ) , <unk> ( northeast ) , Horsens ( 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) south ) and Silkeborg ( 44 kilometres ( 27 mi ) east ) . 
 = = = Topography = = = 
 At Aarhus ' location , the Bay of Aarhus provides a natural harbour with a depth of 10 m ( 33 ft ) quite close to the shore . Aarhus was founded at the mouth of a brackish water fjord , but the original fjord no longer exists , as it has gradually narrowed into what is now the Aarhus River and the Brabrand Lake , due to natural sedimentation . The land around Aarhus was once covered by forests , remains of which exist in parts of Marselisborg Forest to the south and Riis Skov to the north . Several larger lakes extend west from the Skanderborg railway junction and the landscape rises to heights exceeding 152 metres ( 499 ft ) at <unk> , forming part of the larger region called <unk> . 
 The hilly area around Aarhus consists of a <unk> plateau from the last ice age , broken by a complex system of tunnel valleys . The most prominent valleys of this network are the Aarhus Valley in the south , stretching inland east @-@ west with the Aarhus River , Brabrand Lake and <unk> <unk> ( <unk> Lake ) and the <unk> Valley to the north , with the stream of <unk> , <unk> Mose ( <unk> Bog ) and <unk> <unk> ( <unk> Lake ) . Most parts of the two valleys have been drained and subsequently farmed , but recently some of the drainage was removed for environmental reasons . The valley system also includes the <unk> Å ( <unk> River ) in the west and valleys to the south of the city , following erosion channels from the pre @-@ quaternary . By contrast , the Aarhus River Valley and the <unk> River Valley are late glacial meltwater valleys . The coastal cliffs along the Bay of Aarhus consist of shallow tertiary clay from the Eocene and Oligocene ( 57 to 24 million years ago ) . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Aarhus is in the humid continental climate zone ( Köppen : Dfb ) and the weather is influenced by low @-@ pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year . Temperature varies a great deal across the seasons with a mild spring in April and May , warmer summer months from June to August , frequently rainy and windy autumn months in October and September and cooler winter months , often with snow and frost , from December to March . The city centre experiences the same climatic effects as other larger cities with higher wind speeds , more fog , less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding , open land . 
 Western winds from the Atlantic and North Sea are dominant resulting in more precipitation in western Denmark . In addition , Jutland rises sufficiently in the centre to lift air to higher , colder altitudes contributing to increased precipitation in eastern Jutland . Combined these factors make east and south Jutland comparatively wetter than other parts of the country . Average temperature over the year is 8 @.@ 43 ° C ( 47 ° F ) with February being the coldest month ( 0 @.@ 1 ° C ) and August the warmest ( 15 @.@ 9 ° C ) . Temperatures in the sea can reach 17 to 22 degrees Celsius in June to August , but it is not uncommon for beaches to register 25 degrees Celsius locally . 
 The geography in the area affects the local climate of the city with the Aarhus Bay imposing a temperate effect on the low @-@ lying valley floor where central Aarhus is located . Brabrand Lake to the west further contributes to this effect and as a result the valley has a very mild , temperate climate . The sandy ground on the valley floor dries up quickly after winter and warms faster in the summer than the surrounding hills of moist @-@ retaining boulder clay . These conditions affect crops and plants that often bloom 1 – 2 weeks earlier in the valley than on the northern and southern hillsides . 
 Because of the northern latitude , the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter . On the summer solstice , the sun rises at 04 : 26 and sets at 21 : 58 , providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight . On the winter solstice , it rises at 08 : 37 and sets at 15 : 39 with 7 hours and 2 minutes of daylight . The difference in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices is 10 hours and 30 minutes . 
 = = Politics and administration = = 
 Aarhus is the seat of Aarhus Municipality and Aarhus City Council ( Aarhus <unk> ) is also the municipal government . The Mayor of Aarhus until 2017 is Jacob <unk> of the Social Democrats . Municipal elections are held every fourth year on the third Tuesday of November . The city council consists of 31 members elected for four @-@ year terms . When an election has determined the composition of the council , it elects a mayor , two deputy mayors and five aldermen from their ranks . Anyone who is eligible to vote and who resides within the municipality can run for a seat on the city council provided they can secure endorsements and signatures from 50 inhabitants of the municipality . 
 The first publicly elected mayor of Aarhus was appointed in 1919 . In the 1970 Danish Municipal Reform the current Aarhus municipality was created by merging 20 municipalities . Aarhus was the seat of Aarhus County until the 2007 Danish municipal reform , which substituted the Danish counties with five regions and replaced Aarhus County with Central Denmark Region ( Region Midtjylland ) , seated in Viborg . 
 = = = Subdivisions = = = 
 Aarhus Municipality has 45 electoral wards and polling stations in four electoral districts for the <unk> ( national Parliament ) . The diocese of Aarhus has four deaneries composed of 60 parishes within Aarhus municipality . Aarhus municipality contains 21 postal districts and some parts of another 9 . The urban area of Aarhus and the immediate suburbs are divided into the districts Aarhus C , Aarhus N , Aarhus V , Viby J , <unk> and Brabrand . 
 = = = Environmental planning = = = 
 Aarhus has increasingly been investing in environmental planning . The city council has identified a number of environmental targets for the coming years within energy efficiency and aquatic environment . The targets are designed to provide the guidelines for green growth in the city . In accordance with national policy , Aarhus aims to be CO2 neutral and independent of fossil fuels for heating by 2030 . These goals have materialised in a plan to increase multiple @-@ source heat production and the waste and district heating service <unk> Aarhus is building a combined heat and power plant running on biofuels . 
 Aarhus has been heavily involved with several large @-@ scale water treatment projects on many levels in the last two decades and more will follow in the future . The initiatives are part of a larger and broader action plan for Aarhus municipality , that aims for a coherent and holistic administration of the water cycle . This should protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage green growth and self @-@ sufficiency . One of the main tasks is to deal with the large quantities of excessive nutrients in and around Aarhus , primarily nitrogen and phosphorus . A second task is to tackle the increasing levels of precipitation brought about by current and future climate change , and a third important task is to secure fresh , clean and safe drinking water for the future . 
 Aarhus Municipality and the city council have attacked the challenges from different angles in a constructive collaboration with private partners . Many new underground rainwater basins have been built across the city in recent years . The two lakes of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively . Large expanses of forest have been planted in vulnerable land areas in order to secure drinking water and avoid groundwater pollution from pesticides and other sources . Since 1988 , the New Forests of Aarhus have been developed to assist in binding CO2 , securing drinking water , protecting groundwater from pollution , dealing with excessive nutrients , increasing biodiversity , creating an attractive countryside , providing easy access to nature and offering outdoor activities to the public . The afforestation plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners , under a larger national agenda , and there are new afforestation objectives to double the forest cover in Aarhus municipality , before the year 2030 . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 Aarhus has a population of 261 @,@ 570 on 91 square kilometres ( 35 sq mi ) for a density of 2 @,@ 874 / km2 ( 7 @,@ 444 / sq mi ) . Aarhus municipality has a population of 330 @,@ 639 on 468 km2 with a density of 706 / km2 ( 1 @,@ 829 / sq mi ) . Less than a fifth of the municipal population resides beyond city limits and almost all live in an urban area . The population of Aarhus is both younger and better @-@ educated than the national average which can be attributed to the high concentration of educational institutions . More than 40 % of the population have an academic degree while only some 14 % have no secondary education or trade . The largest age group is 20- to 29 @-@ year @-@ olds and the average age is 37 @.@ 5 , making it the youngest city in the country and one of its youngest municipalities . Women have slightly outnumbered men for many years . 
 The city is home to 75 different religious groups and denominations most of which are Christian or Muslim with a smaller number of Buddhist and Hindu communities . Since the 1990s there has been a marked growth in diverse new spiritual groups although the total number of followers remains small . The majority of the population are members of the Protestant state church , Church of Denmark , which is by far the largest religious institution both in the city and the country as a whole . Some 20 % of the population are not officially affiliated with any religion , a percentage that has been slowly rising for many years . 
 Aarhus has the highest ratio of immigrants in Denmark , 14 @.@ 8 % of the population , outside the Copenhagen area . During the 1990s there was significant immigration from Turkey and in recent years , there has been high growth in the overall immigrant community , from 27 @,@ 783 people in 1999 to 40 @,@ 431 in 2008 . The majority of immigrants have roots outside Europe and the developed world , comprising some 25 @,@ 000 people from 130 different nationalities , with the largest groups coming from the Middle East and north Africa . Some 15 @,@ 000 have come from within Europe , with Poland , Germany , Romania and Norway being the largest contributors . 
 Many immigrants have established themselves in Brabrand , Hasle and Viby , where the percentage of inhabitants with foreign origins has risen by 66 % since the year 2000 . This has resulted in several ' especially vulnerable residential areas ' ( a.k.a. ghettos ) , with <unk> as the most notable neighbourhood . In Brabrand and <unk> , two thirds of the population now have a non @-@ Danish ethnic background . The international cultures present in the community are an obvious and visible part of the city 's daily life and contribute many cultural flavours hitherto uncommon for the Nordic countries , including Bazar Vest , a market with shopkeepers predominantly of foreign descent . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The economy of Aarhus is predominantly knowledge and service based , strongly influenced by the University of Aarhus and the large healthcare industry . The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing . Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network . Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality . The municipality is home to 175 @,@ 000 jobs with some 100 @,@ 000 in the private sector and the rest split between state , region and municipality . The region is a major agricultural producer , with many large farms in the outlying districts . 
 The job market is knowledge and service based and the largest employment sectors are healthcare and social services , trade , education , consulting , research , industry and telecommunications . The municipality has more high and middle income jobs , and fewer low income jobs , than the national average . 
 Today the majority of the largest companies in the municipality are in the sectors of trade , transport and media . The wind power industry has strong roots in Aarhus , and the larger region of Midtjylland , and nationally most of the revenue in the industry is generated by companies in the greater Aarhus area . The wind industry employs about a thousand people within the municipality making it a central component in the local economy . The biotech industry is well established in the city with many small and medium @-@ sized companies mainly focused on research and development . 
 The city has become a leading centre for retail in the Nordic and Baltic countries with expansive shopping centres , the busiest commercial street in the country and a dense urban core with many specialty shops . People commute to Aarhus from as far away as Randers , Silkeborg and Skanderborg and almost a third of those employed within Aarhus municipality commute from neighbouring communities . 
 Several major companies have their headquarters in Aarhus such as Arla Foods , one of the largest dairy groups in Europe , Dansk <unk> , Denmark 's largest retailer , <unk> , a world @-@ wide retailer specializing in household goods , bedding , furniture and interior design , Vestas , one of the major wind turbine producers worldwide , and several leading retail companies . In total four of the 10 largest companies in the country are based in the municipality . Since the early 2000s the city has experienced an influx of larger companies moving from other parts of the Jutland peninsula . Other large employers of note include <unk> ( a trades union organisation ) and 5R , a telemarketing company , while metallurgy and electronics remain important sectors . 
 = = = Port of Aarhus = = = 
 The Port of Aarhus is one of the largest industrial ports in northern Europe with the largest container terminal in Denmark , processing more than 50 % of Denmark 's container traffic and accommodating the largest container vessels in the world . It is a municipal self @-@ governing port with independent finances . The facilities handle some 9 @.@ 5 million tonnes of cargo a year ( 2012 ) . Grain is the principal export , while feedstuffs , stone , cement and coal are among the chief imports . Since 2012 the port has faced increasing competition from the Port of Hamburg and freight volumes have decreased somewhat from the peak in 2008 . 
 The ferry terminal presents the only alternative to the Great Belt Link for passenger transport between Jutland and Zealand . It has served different ferry companies since the first steamship route to Copenhagen opened in 1830 . Currently Mols @-@ <unk> operates the route and annually transports some 2 million passengers and a million vehicles . Additional roll @-@ on / roll @-@ off cargo ferries serve Finland and <unk> on a weekly basis and smaller outlying Danish ports at irregular intervals . Since the early 2000s the port has increasingly become a destination for cruise lines operating in the Baltic Sea . 
 = = = Tourism = = = 
 The ARoS Art Museum , the Old Town Museum and Tivoli <unk> are among Denmark 's top tourist attractions . With a combined total of almost 1 @.@ 4 million visitors they represent the driving force behind tourism but other venues such as Moesgård Museum and <unk> are also popular . The city 's extensive shopping facilities are also said to be a major attraction for tourists , as are festivals , especially NorthSide and SPOT . Many visitors arrive on cruise ships : in 2012 , 18 vessels visited the port with over 38 @,@ 000 passengers . 
 In the 2010s there has been a significant expansion of tourist facilities , culminating in the opening of the 240 @-@ room <unk> Hotel in July 2014 , which increased the number of hotel rooms in the city by 25 % . Some estimates put the number of visitors spending at least one night as high as 750 @,@ 000 a year , most of them Danes from other regions , the remainder coming mainly from Norway , Sweden , northern Germany and the United Kingdom . Overall , they spend about DKK 3 billion ( $ 540 million ) in the city each year . The primary motivation for tourists choosing Aarhus as a destination is experiencing the city and culture , family and couples vacation or as a part of a round trip in Denmark . The average stay is little more than three days on average . 
 There are more than 30 tourist information spots across the city , some of them staffed , while others are on @-@ line , publicly accessible touch screens . The official tourist information service in Aarhus is organised under <unk> , a corporate foundation initiated in 1994 by Aarhus Municipality and local commercial interest organisations . 
 = = = Research parks = = = 
 Over the past ten years , Aarhus has been one of Denmark 's most rapidly developing centres of research in information technology , energy , media , life sciences , food , architecture and design . Enterprises in the Information and communications technology ( ICT ) sphere work in collaboration with the city 's research institutes . In 2007 the three largest research parks of Forskerpark Aarhus ( Science Park Aarhus ) , Forskerpark Skejby ( Science Park - Skejby ) and IT @-@ Huset Katrinebjerg , merged to form INCUBA Science Park . Forskerpark Skejby , which works in the field of biomedical research , and the Katrinebjerg department - focusing on ICT - has since been expanded and in 2014 the new department of INCUBA <unk> opened on the Aarhus Docklands . 
 One of the major research companies is Systematic A / S , working in the public sector , healthcare and defence . The IT City Katrinebjerg , fosters collaboration between research , education and industry through the university branches of Department of Computer Science , Department of Aesthetics and Communication and Alexandra Institute . In the clean energy sector , Aarhus is home to leading participants including Vestas , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The <unk> Park at the docklands is a new information and innovation park bringing together players in the energy , environment and building sectors . The centre is sponsored by Aarhus University School of Engineering , Aarhus School of Marine and Technical Engineering ( AAMS ) and INCUBA . 
 = = Cityscape = = 
 Aarhus has developed in stages , from the Viking age to modern times , all visible in the city today . Many architectural styles are represented in different parts of the city such as Romanesque , Gothic , Renaissance , Baroque , Rococo , National Romantic , Nordic classicism , Neoclassical , Empire and Functionalism . The city has grown up around the main transport hubs , the harbour and later the railway station and as a result , the oldest parts of the city are also the most central and busiest today . 
 The streets <unk> ( lit Rampart ) and Graven ( lit . Moat ) testify to the defences of the initial Viking settlement and <unk> in <unk> roughly follows the boundaries of that settlement . The street network in the inner city formed during the Middle Ages with narrow , curved streets and low , dense housing by the river and coast . <unk> ( lit . Western Gate ) still bears the name of a medieval city gate and the narrow alleyways <unk> and <unk> are remnants of toll stations from that time . The inner city has the oldest preserved houses , especially the Latin Quarter , with buildings dating back to the early 17th century in <unk> and Skolegade . Medieval merchants ' mansions with courtyards can be seen in <unk> , <unk> and Skolegade . 
 = = = Landmarks = = = 
 Aarhus Cathedral ( Århus <unk> ) in the centre of Aarhus , is the longest and tallest church in Denmark at 93 m ( 305 ft ) and 96 m ( 315 ft ) in length and height respectively . Originally built as a Romanesque basilica in the 13th century , it was rebuilt and enlarged as a Gothic cathedral in the late 15th and early 16th centuries . Even though the cathedral stood finished around 1300 , it took more than a century to build ; the associated cathedral school of Aarhus <unk> was already founded in 1195 and ranks as the 44th oldest school in the world . Another important and historic church in the inner city , is the Church of our Lady ( Vor Frue Kirke ) also from the 13th century in Romanesque and Gothic style . It is smaller and less impressive , but it was the first cathedral of Aarhus and founded on an even older church constructed in 1060 ; the oldest stone church in Scandinavia . Parts of this former church were excavated in the 1950s and can now be experienced as a crypt beneath the nave of Vor Frue Kirke . <unk> Kaserne in National Romantic style from 1889 is the oldest former military barracks left in the country ; home to the university Department of Aesthetics and Communication since 1989 . Marselisborg Palace ( Marselisborg Slot ) , designed by Hack Kampmann in Neoclassical and Art Nouveau styles , was donated by the city to Prince Christian and Princess Alexandrine as a wedding present in 1898 . The Aarhus Custom House ( <unk> ) from 1898 , is said to be Hack Kampmann 's finest work . 
 Tivoli <unk> ( lit . Tivoli Freedom ) opened in 1903 and has since been the largest amusement park in the city and a tourist attraction . Aarhus Theatre from 1916 in the Art Nouveau style is the largest provincial theatre in Denmark . The early buildings of Aarhus University , especially the main building completed in 1932 , designed by Kay Fisker , <unk> <unk> and by C.F. Møller have gained an international reputation for their contribution to functionalist architecture . The City Hall ( Aarhus <unk> ) from 1941 with an iconic 60 m ( 200 ft ) tower clad in marble , was designed by Arne Jacobsen and Erik Møller in a modern Functionalist style . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Aarhus is home to many annual cultural events and festivals , museums , theatres and sports event and presents some of the largest cultural attractions in Denmark . There is a long tradition here in music of all genres and many Danish bands have emerged from Aarhus . Libraries , cultural centres and educational institutions present free or easy opportunities for the citizens to participate in , engage in or be creative with cultural events and productions of all kinds . 
 Selected as European Capital of Culture in 2017 , Aarhus prides itself on offering a combination of innovation , media and communication together with architecture and design , and has a wide variety of cultural institutions . The city is a member of the <unk> organisation ( International Cities of Refuge Network ) in an effort to provide a safe haven to authors and writers persecuted in their countries of origin . The State Library ( <unk> ) at the university campus has status of a national library . 
 = = = Museums = = = 
 Aarhus has many museums and two of the largest in the country measured by the number of visitors , Den Gamle By and ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum . Den Gamle By ( The Old Town ) , officially Danmarks <unk> ( Denmark 's Market Town Museum ) , presents Danish townscapes from the 16th century to the 1970s with individual areas focused on different time periods . 75 historic buildings collected from different parts of the country have been brought here to create a small town in its own right . 
 ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum , the city 's main art museum is one of the largest art museums in Scandinavia with a collection covering Danish art from the 18th century to the present day as well as paintings , installations and sculptures representing international art movements and artists from all over the world . The iconic glass structure on the roof , Your Rainbow Panorama , was designed by Olafur Eliasson and features a promenade offering a colourful panorama of the city . 
 The Moesgård Museum specialises in archaeology and ethnography in collaboration with Aarhus University with exhibits on Denmark 's prehistory , including weapon sacrifices from <unk> <unk> and the Grauballe Man . <unk> , the Women 's Museum , from 1984 contains collections of the lives and works of women in Danish cultural history . The Occupation Museum ( <unk> ) presents exhibits illustrating the German occupation of the city during the Second World War ; the University Park on the campus of Aarhus University includes the Natural History Museum with 5 @,@ 000 species of animals , many in their natural surroundings ; and the Steno Museum is a museum of the history of science and medicine with a planetarium . Kunsthal Aarhus ( Aarhus Art Hall ) hosts exhibitions of contemporary art including painting , sculpture , photography , performance art , film and video . Strictly speaking it is not a museum but an arts centre and one of the oldest in Europe , built and founded in 1917 . 
 = = = Libraries and community centres = = = 
 Libraries in Denmark are also cultural and community centres . They play an active role in the cultural life and host many events , exhibitions , discussion groups , workshops , educational courses and facilitate everyday cultural activities for and by the citizens . In June 2015 , the large central library and cultural centre of Dokk1 opened at the harbour front . Dokk1 also includes civil administrations and services , commercial office rentals and a large underground robotic car park and aims to be a landmark for the city and a public meeting place . The building of Dokk1 and the associated squares and streetscape is also collectively known as Urban <unk> Aarhus and it is the largest construction project Aarhus municipality has ever undertaken . Apart from this large main library , some neighbourhoods in Aarhus have a local library engaged in similar cultural and educational activities , but on a more local scale . 
 There are also several cultural and community centres scattered throughout the city . This includes <unk> in the central <unk> , facilitating events for and by non @-@ commercial associations , organisations and clubs , and activities for the elderly , the nearby Godsbanen at the railway yard , with workshops , events and exhibitions , and <unk> in Brabrand facilitating sports and various cultural activities .

 = = = Local dialect = = = 
 The Aarhus Danish dialect , commonly called <unk> ( Lit . : Aarhusian ) , is a Jutlandic dialect ( Danish : <unk> ) in the Mid @-@ Eastern Jutland dialect area , traditionally spoken in and around Aarhus . Aarhusian , as most local dialects in Denmark , has diminished in use through the 20th century and most people today speak some version of Standard Danish with regional features although it still has a strong presence in older segments of the population and in areas with high numbers of immigrants . 
 Common or traditional Aarhusian words are : <unk> ( tiresome ) , <unk> ( silly or dumb ) and <unk> ( <unk> damn me ) . The dialect is notable for single syllable words ending in " d " being pronounced with <unk> while the same letter in multiple syllable words is pronounced as " j " , i.e .. <unk> is pronounced " <unk> " . Like other dialects in East Jutland it has two grammatical genders , similar to Standard Danish , but different from West Jutlandic dialects which have only one . 
 In 2009 the University of Aarhus compiled a list of contemporary public figures , who best exemplify the dialect , including Jacob Haugaard , Thomas Helmig , Steffen Brandt , Stig <unk> , Flemming Jørgensen , Tina <unk> and Camilla Martin . In popular culture the dialect features prominently in Niels <unk> ' movie Aarhus By Night and 90s comedy sketches by Jacob Haugaard and Finn <unk> .

 " Homer Defined " is the fifth episode of The Simpsons ' third season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 17 , 1991 . In the episode , Homer accidentally saves the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant from meltdown by arbitrarily choosing the emergency override button via a counting rhyme . He is honored as a hero and receives praise from his daughter Lisa , but he starts to feel unworthy because he knows that his so @-@ called heroism was just luck . Meanwhile , Bart is downhearted after learning that Milhouse 's mother has forbidden him to spend time with Bart anymore . 
 The episode was written by freelance writer Howard Gewirtz and directed by Mark Kirkland . Basketball player Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers made a guest appearance in the episode as himself , becoming the first professional athlete to do so on the show . He appears in two sequences , one of which sees him calling Homer to congratulate him on saving the plant . The second appearance comes later in the episode in a basketball game sequence that Lakers sportscaster Chick Hearn also guest stars in . 
 The episode has received generally positive reviews from critics , particularly Johnson 's appearance . In its original airing on the Fox network , " Homer Defined " acquired a 12 @.@ 7 Nielsen rating — the equivalent of being watched in approximately 11 @.@ 69 million homes — and finished the week ranked 36th . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant , Homer is eating doughnuts . One of them splatters onto the nuclear reactor core 's temperature dial , which is nearing the red zone . Homer fails to see the warning and the plant approaches a nuclear meltdown . He seems to be the only person who can stop it , though he has no skills and cannot remember any of his training ( due to being distracted and occupied with a Rubik 's Cube at the time ) . In desperation , he chooses a button at random with a counting rhyme , which miraculously averts the meltdown . Springfield is saved and Homer is hailed as a hero . Mr. Burns names Homer " Employee of the Month " . Homer 's family is also proud of him , especially Lisa , who starts to see him as a role model . Meanwhile , Homer himself is troubled by the fact that his so @-@ called heroism was nothing but luck , and his gloomy mood deepens when he receives a congratulatory phone call from Magic Johnson , who tells Homer " People like that are eventually exposed as the frauds they are " . 
 Burns introduces Homer to Aristotle Amadopoulos , the owner of the nuclear power plant in Shelbyville , Springfield 's neighbor town . Amadopoulos wants Homer to give a pep talk to his plant 's lackluster workers . Homer is hesitant to accept , but Burns forces him into it . At the Shelbyville plant , he gives a fumbling motivational speech . Suddenly an impending meltdown threatens the Shelbyville plant . Amadopoulos and Homer go to the control room , and Amadopoulos asks Homer to avert the meltdown . In front of everyone , Homer repeats his rhyme and presses a button blindly . By luck , he again manages to avert a meltdown . Amadopoulos thanks Homer for saving the plant , but angrily berates him for his stupidity . Soon the phrase " to pull a Homer " , meaning " to succeed despite idiocy , " becomes widely used and is entered into the dictionary . 
 In the subplot , the relationship between Bart and his friend Milhouse has changed . On the bus ride to school , Bart is upset to discover that Milhouse had held a birthday party without inviting him . It turns out that Milhouse 's mother , Luann Van Houten , thinks Bart is a bad influence on Milhouse and has banned him from seeing Bart , a decision Milhouse is downbeat about but makes no effort to defy . Suddenly deprived of his friend , a depressed Bart resorts to playing with Maggie . When Marge finds out about the situation , she decides to visit Luann . Marge admits that Bart is a " bit of a handful , " and she explains that he and Milhouse are best friends and only have each other , so she asks Luann to allow the boys to play together . Later , Milhouse invites Bart over to his house , and Bart thanks Marge for standing up for him . 
 = = Production = = 
 The episode was written by freelance writer Howard Gewirtz . It was one of many stories he pitched to the producers of the show . According to executive producer Al Jean , Gewirtz 's script ended up featuring one of the longest first acts ( an act being the amount of time between commercial breaks ) in the history of the show when the episode was completed . Gewirtz 's script originally contained two uses of the word " ass " , once from Bart and once from Burns . This was the first time a character in the show had used this word , and it led to problems with the network censors . Eventually , the censors forced the producers to remove one instance , so that Bart 's line was changed to " bad influence , my butt . " 
 Basketball player Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers guest stars in the episode as himself . He was the first professional athlete to do so on the show . Johnson appears in two sequences : first in a scene in which he calls to congratulate Homer on saving the plant , and later in the episode during a basketball game when he " pulls a Homer " by accidentally getting the ball into the basket after slipping on the floor . The recording of the episode was done during the National Basketball Association 's regular season , so the producers had a hard time scheduling Johnson 's session . With the deadline approaching , the producers traveled to Johnson 's home to record his lines . According to the San Jose Mercury News , the recording equipment brought to his home did not work at first and " almost doomed the guest spot . " Lakers sportscaster Chick Hearn also guest stars in the episode , commentating on the game that Johnson plays . 
 Another guest star that appeared in the episode was actor Jon Lovitz , who provided the voice for Aristotle Amadopoulos and a minor character that appears in a soap opera . This was Lovitz 's third appearance on the show . The character Amadopoulos that he played was designed to look like the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis . The character 's dialogue was written to emulate Lovitz 's comedic style , such as his ability for rapid mood swings . Amadopoulos returned a few episodes later in " Homer at the Bat " , though in that episode he was voiced by cast member Dan Castellaneta rather than Lovitz . 
 Milhouse 's mother , Luann Van Houten , makes her first appearance in this episode . She was designed to look very similar to Milhouse . Maggie Roswell was assigned to voice the character and she originally based it on Milhouse , who is voiced by Pamela Hayden . The producers felt that her impression sounded out of place so she ended up using a more normal sounding voice . It was Gewirtz who in this episode gave Milhouse his last name , Van Houten , which he got from one of his wife 's friends . 
 Director Mark Kirkland wanted the Springfield Power Plant to " look the best it had to date " and inserted shadows and back @-@ lighting effects to make the panels in Homer 's control room glow .

 In its original airing on the Fox network , the episode acquired a 12 @.@ 7 Nielsen rating and was viewed in approximately 11 @.@ 69 million homes . It finished the week of October 14 – 20 , 1991 , ranked 36th , down from the season 's average rank of 32nd . It ranked second in its timeslot behind The Cosby Show , which finished 24th with a 15 @.@ 5 rating . The episode was tied with In Living Color as the highest rated show on Fox that week . 
 " Homer Defined " has received generally positive reviews from critics . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , described it as an excellent episode that added new depth to the show in the scene with Marge trying to convince Luann to let Milhouse play with Bart again . They added that Lisa 's " faith in her heroic father makes a nice change " , and said that the episode 's ending , in which Homer enters the dictionary , " is most satisfying . " Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide commented that after the episode " Bart the Murderer " , this episode marks a regression , saying it was almost inevitable that it would not match up to the previous episode . He went on to say that the subplot with Bart and Milhouse was more entertaining . Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 4 / 5 rating , writing that he enjoyed the Homer story but found the Bart and Milhouse subplot more interesting . He added that " Milhouse 's mom won 't allow him to play with Bart because she thinks Bart is a bad influence . It 's rare for the show to allow Bart to feel genuine emotion , but there is plenty of it in this episode that makes for a nice character oriented story . " 
 Johnson 's performance has also been praised . In 2004 , ESPN released a list of the top 100 Simpsons sport moments , ranking his appearance at number 27 . Sports Illustrated listed Johnson 's cameo as the fifth best athlete guest appearance on The Simpsons . Meyers wrote that the episode " makes a lot of good points about the public making heroes in a rash , hysterical manner , " and this point is made " with an amusing cameo by Earvin ' Magic ' Johnson " . The San Diego Union 's Fritz <unk> said the animators " did [ Johnson 's ] likeness good , " and noted that in the game the " colors on the Lakers jerseys and the Forum court were correct . Chick Hearn and Stu Lantz were almost lifelike , announcing at courtside in Sunday @-@ color @-@ comics sweaters . And Chick 's play @-@ by @-@ play was so real Stu couldn 't get a word in . " Johnson 's appearance was broadcast on CNN 's Sports Tonight the day before the episode originally aired , and host Fred Hickman stated that he did not find it humorous . 
 In his book Watching with The Simpsons : Television , Parody , and Intertextuality , Jonathan Gray discusses a scene from " Homer Defined " that shows Homer reading a USA Today with the cover story : " America 's Favorite Pencil – # 2 is # 1 " . Lisa sees this title and criticizes the newspaper as a " flimsy hodge @-@ podge of high @-@ brass factoids and Larry King " , to which Homer responds that it is " the only paper in America that 's not afraid to tell the truth : that everything is just fine . " In the book , Gray says this scene is used by the show 's producers to criticize " how often the news is wholly toothless , sacrificing journalism for sales , and leaving us not with important public information , but with America 's Favorite Pencil .

 From the Ages is the third full @-@ length studio album by American rock band Earthless . It was released on October 8 , 2013 by Tee Pee Records . It had been six years since the band ’ s last full @-@ length studio album , Rhythms from a Cosmic Sky , as all three members of Earthless were pre @-@ occupied with other matters , including other bands . 
 The album comprises four songs , all instrumental , and was recorded in two days . Much of the album ’ s material had existed in the band ’ s live repertoire before – in particular the album 's title track had been released in an early form on the band 's 2008 live album Live at Roadburn – and the rest of it was created during the recording sessions and rehearsals . Despite the band 's preference for analog tape , the title track had to be recorded digitally to accommodate its length . 
 The album was released to mostly positive critical reaction , with criticisms usually directed at the length of the material ( and of the title track in particular ) amid praises for its composition and depth . A number of publications cited the album as one of the best 2013 releases on year @-@ end lists . Earthless earned two nominations at the San Diego Music Awards , and From the Ages became the band ’ s second album to win the Best Hard Rock Album award there .

 Earthless ' last studio album , Rhythms from a Cosmic Sky , had come out in 2007 , and their live album Live at Roadburn ( on which an early version of " From the Ages " was recorded ) in 2008 ; further releases had been delayed since then as members of Earthless were becoming increasingly pre @-@ occupied with other matters . Constant touring in 2008 and 2009 kept the band out of the studio , drummer Mario Rubalcaba began playing with Off ! and guitarist Isaiah Mitchell became involved with Howlin ' Rain . Mitchell also moved to northern California , which reduced the available time to rehearse with Earthless ( who are based in San Diego ) . After three rehearsals , the band recorded the album in two days , recording much of it live the first day and additional details the following day , in San Francisco with producer Phil Manley in his studio , Lucky Cat Recording .

 The songs on the album began as " very loose , general ideas " according to Rubalcaba , who also said " Violence of the Red Sea " was the most organized , structured song on the album ( although he later said the same of the title track ) . Eginton wrote the bass lines for " Violence of the Red Sea " , inspired by funk and " prog @-@ psych " bands from the UK and Europe . The song , which had been included in the band 's concert setlist for the last few years prior to recording , was named after the combination of riffs and tempos which " <unk> [ ed ] together like an angry sea " . The song 's finale was present in the band 's repertoire for almost a decade and was used to close the song for the tension it created , whereas the opening of the song was considered more of a " laid back groove " . After Rubalcaba and Eginton had outlined the song 's bass guitar and drum parts in Mitchell 's absence ( due to now living elsewhere ) , Mitchell was allowed to improvise lead guitar over them when he was able to play with the duo . 
 " Uluru Rock " was named after the Uluru rock formation in Australia , as an homage to the country , and was written by Mitchell and Eginton through improvisations while they waited for Rubalcaba to get on stage to begin the band 's first show in the country At the time the band had not been to the landmark . As a tribute to the natives , the song was specifically named Uluru as opposed to Ayers Rock , the landmark 's other official name . " Uluru Rock " became the opening song on the band 's setlist for all shows thereafter . 
 " Equus October " was born out of a song that the band were considering discarding because they were never able to finish it until they entered the studio and changed their minds , wanting more material on the album . They decided to use a riff from it only as an interlude that ran 30 seconds long , but they came up with more ideas about what to do with it during the mixing process , eventually increasing the length of the song . Rubalcaba explained that the bass guitar line remained a constant fixture on jam sessions between himself and Eginton , and they decided to give it a chance by recording it at the album 's sessions . Once Mitchell also began adding material to the song , Rubalcaba felt it started taking on a " strong & majestic yet mournful " sensation , almost as if it were about a ritualistic sacrifice . He later discovered the ritual of the October Horse and based the song 's title on that of the ritual . " It took on the feeling I had about the jam & how it just completely comes crashing down so abruptly at the end , " he explained . Expanding the song in the studio led the group to want to use it as an interlude that leads into the album 's title track . 
 " From the Ages " was recorded for the band 's live album Live at Roadburn five years before and , being very long , was described by Rubalcaba as " a bastard to play [ and relearn ] " . The band wanted to record it in as few takes as possible in spite of its length , which they addressed by recording the song in Pro Tools as they expected it could be up to forty minutes long ; in the past they used analog tape which only allowed for about twenty minutes of music but , according to Rubalcaba , yielded the best recording quality . Earthless rehearsed " From the Ages " for three days before recording it in about three takes . In the last five minutes of the song , the band very gently ease into the end , to avoid having to end the song abruptly . Although he had said the same of " Violence of the Red Sea " with respect to the album itself in a previous interview , Rubalcaba later described " From the Ages " as the most organized , planned song the band had yet ever recorded , let alone recorded for this album . He described the mixture of influences in the song as " A supreme psycho @-@ <unk> buffet served up with all the sour Kraut , all the freshest sushi Japan has to offer & what not " . Rubalcaba reiterated the " pre @-@ historic , caveman , dry & mysterious wasteland feel " that inspired the title . The song expanded constantly during rehearsals and evolved after its debut on Live at Roadburn .

 From the Ages was released on October 8 , 2013 , by Tee Pee Records . The artwork was created by artist Alan Forbes , whose work Rubalcaba commended as " captur [ ing ] [ the phrase " From the Ages " ] to a T " . 
 From the Ages charted at # 25 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart for a week . Critical reaction to the album was largely positive , though the album 's length was commonly cited as a minor flaw . Metacritic reported a score of 84 based on five reviews , indicating " Universal acclaim " . " Though the silence may have been deafening for their small but devoted cadre of fans , the wait was worth every moment , " wrote Erik Highter for PopMatters , who described the chemistry between the band members as " near telepathic connections between the players " and the roles of Eginton and Rubalcaba as " pulling " Mitchell back from potential unrestrained solos . He rated the album 8 out of 10 , his only complaint being that listeners may consider the title track too long . Conversely , Grayson Currin of Pitchfork Media said that the rhythm section did not serve to restrain Mitchell at times , but to " instead follow his ecstatic lead everywhere , fellow travelers on his odyssey of enthusiasms " . He echoed Highter 's opinion with respect to the title track 's length , calling it " the one moment [ on the album ] where the band 's patience might test your own " and asked , regarding the length and repetitive nature of the album as a whole , " is there a need for an hour of three dudes tracing and retracing a melody ? " The length of " From the Ages " was also criticized by Exclaim ! reviewer <unk> MacDonald who cited it as the record 's " only flaw " and rated the album overall 8 out of 10 . 
 eMusic contributor Dan Epstein rated the album 4 @.@ 5 stars out of 5 and described the interaction between band members similarly to Highter and Currin , saying that , while Mitchell 's guitar leads are prominent , Eginton and Rubalcaba are " locked @-@ in " with him and each other , " never los [ ing ] focus or intensity for a second — not even during the rolling 30 @-@ minute title track . " In his review for NOW Magazine , John <unk> said that while inferior to Rhythms from a Cosmic Sky , the high point was the opening track , " Violence of the Red Sea " , and the album is " an essential record for anyone who likes the sound of guitars sounding like guitars " . Karen A. Mann also wrote , for the heavy metal section of About.com , that the opening track was the band 's peak performance on the album , which she rated 4 out of 5 . Rolling Stone referred to the album as one of the 20 best metal albums of 2013 , while Magnet named it the third best of the year 's top ten hard rock releases . Likewise , the Austin Chronicle ranked it ninth in the top ten metal releases of 2013 , and later reviewer Raoul Hernandez gave the album a perfect four @-@ star review . Earthless were again nominated for Best Hard Rock Artist at the 2013 San Diego Music Awards , and the record won the 2014 award for Best Hard Rock Album , becoming the band 's second record to do so ( their debut Sonic Prayer won the award in 2007 ) . 
 In support of the album , Earthless toured the west coast of the United States in October 2013 , with the Shrine in Australia from December 2013 to January 2014 , and the east coast of the US in August 2014 . They also embarked on a tour of Europe that fall . The band had planned a tour of Japan with Eternal Elysium , but were forced to cancel the engagement to tend to ill family members ; they rescheduled it for January 2015 .

 = International System of Units = 
 The International System of Units ( French : Système international d 'unités , SI ) is the modern form of the metric system , and is the most widely used system of measurement . It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units . It defines twenty @-@ two named units , and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units . The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units . 
 The system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that began in 1948 . It is based on the metre @-@ kilogram @-@ second system of units ( MKS ) rather than any variant of the centimetre @-@ gram @-@ second system ( CGS ) . SI is intended to be an evolving system , so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves . The 24th and 25th General Conferences on Weights and Measures ( CGPM ) in 2011 and 2014 , for example , discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram , linking it to an invariant of nature rather than to the mass of a material artefact , thereby ensuring long @-@ term stability . 
 The motivation for the development of the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the CGS systems and the lack of coordination between the various disciplines that used them . The CGPM , which was established by the Metre Convention of 1875 , brought together many international organisations to not only agree on the definitions and standards of the new system but also agree on the rules for writing and presenting measurements in a standardised manner around the world . 
 The International System of Units has been adopted by most developed countries ; however , the adoption has not been universal in all English @-@ speaking countries . While metrication in the United States is consistent in science , medicine , government , and various fields of technology and engineering , common measurements are mostly performed in United States customary units , although these have officially been defined in terms of SI units . The United Kingdom has officially adopted a policy of partial metrication . Canada has adopted the SI for most governmental , medical and scientific purposes and for such varied uses as grocery weights , weather reports , traffic signs and gasoline sales , but imperial units are still legally permitted and remain in common use throughout many sectors of Canadian society , particularly in the building trade and the railway sector . 
 = = History = = 
 The metric system was first implemented during the French Revolution ( 1790s ) with just the metre and kilogram as standards of length and mass respectively . In the 1830s Carl Friedrich Gauss laid the foundations for a coherent system based on length , mass , and time . In the 1860s a group working under the auspices of the British Association for the Advancement of Science formulated the requirement for a coherent system of units with base units and derived units . The inclusion of electrical units into the system was hampered by the customary use of more than one set of units , until 1900 when Giovanni Giorgi identified the need to define one single electrical quantity as a fourth base quantity alongside the original three base quantities . 
 Meanwhile , in 1875 , the Treaty of the Metre passed responsibility for verification of the kilogram and metre against agreed prototypes from French to international control . In 1921 , the Treaty was extended to include all physical quantities including electrical units originally defined in 1893 . 
 In 1948 , an overhaul of the metric system was set in motion which resulted in the development of the " Practical system of units " which , on its publication in 1960 , was given the name " The International System of Units " . In 1954 , the 10th General Conference on Weights and Measures ( CGPM ) identified electric current as the fourth base quantity in the practical system of units and added two more base quantities — temperature and luminous intensity — making six base quantities in all . The units associated with these quantities were the metre , kilogram , second , ampere , kelvin and candela . In 1971 , a seventh base quantity , amount of substance represented by the mole , was added to the definition of SI . 
 = = = Early development = = = 
 The metric system was developed from 1791 onwards by a committee of the French Academy of Sciences , commissioned by the National Assembly and Louis XVI to create a unified and rational system of measures . The group , which included Antoine Lavoisier ( the " father of modern chemistry " ) and the mathematicians Pierre @-@ Simon Laplace and Adrien @-@ Marie Legendre , used the same principles for relating length , volume , and mass that had been proposed by the English clergyman John Wilkins in 1668 and the concept of using the Earth 's meridian as the basis of the definition of length , originally proposed in 1670 by the French abbot Mouton . 
 On 30 March 1791 , the Assembly adopted the committee 's proposed principles for the new decimal system of measure and authorised a survey between Dunkirk and Barcelona to establish the length of the meridian . On 11 July 1792 , the committee proposed the names metre , are , litre and grave for the units of length , area , capacity , and mass , respectively . The committee also proposed that multiples and submultiples of these units were to be denoted by decimal @-@ based prefixes such as <unk> for a hundredth and kilo for a thousand . 
 The law of 7 April 1795 ( loi du 18 germinal ) defined the terms gramme and kilogramme , which replaced the former terms gravet ( correctly <unk> ) and grave , and on 22 June 1799 ( after Pierre Méchain and Jean @-@ Baptiste Delambre had completed the meridian survey ) the definitive standard mètre des Archives and kilogramme des Archives were deposited in the Archives nationales . On 10 December 1799 ( a month after Napoleon 's coup d 'état ) , the law by which the metric system was to be definitively adopted in France ( loi du 19 frimaire ) was passed . 
 During the first half of the nineteenth century there was little consistency in the choice of preferred multiples of the base units – typically the <unk> ( 10000 metres ) was in widespread use in both France and parts of Germany , while the kilogram ( 1000 grams ) rather than the <unk> was used for mass . 
 In 1832 , the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss , assisted by Wilhelm Weber , implicitly defined the second as a base unit when he quoted the earth 's magnetic field in terms of millimetres , grams , and seconds . Prior to this , the strength of the earth ’ s magnetic field had only been described in relative terms . The technique used by Gauss was to equate the torque induced on a suspended magnet of known mass by the earth ’ s magnetic field with the torque induced on an equivalent system under gravity . The resultant calculations enabled him to assign dimensions based on mass , length and time to the magnetic field . 
 In the 1860s , James Clerk Maxwell , William Thomson ( later Lord Kelvin ) and others working under the auspices of the British Association for the Advancement of Science , built on Gauss ' work and formalised the concept of a coherent system of units with base units and derived units . The principle of coherence was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the centimetre – gram – second ( CGS ) system of units ( CGS ) , including the erg for energy , the dyne for force , the <unk> for pressure , the poise for dynamic viscosity and the stokes for kinematic viscosity . 
 = = = Metre Convention = = = 
 A French @-@ inspired initiative for international cooperation in metrology led to the signing in 1875 of the Metre Convention . Initially the convention only covered standards for the metre and the kilogram . A set of 30 prototypes of the metre and 40 prototypes of the kilogram , in each case made of a 90 % platinum @-@ 10 % iridium alloy , were manufactured by the British firm Johnson , Matthey & Co and accepted by the CGPM in 1889 . One of each was selected at random to become the International prototype metre and International prototype kilogram that replaced the mètre des Archives and kilogramme des Archives respectively . Each member state was entitled to one of each of the remaining prototypes to serve as the national prototype for that country . 
 The treaty established three international organisations to oversee the keeping of international standards of measurement : 
 General Conference on Weights and Measures ( Conférence générale des poids et mesures or CGPM ) – a meeting every four to six years of delegates from all member states that receives and discusses a report from the CIPM and that endorses new developments in the SI on the advice of the CIPM . 
 International Committee for Weights and Measures ( Comité international des poids et mesures or CIPM ) – a committee that meets annually at the BIPM and is made up of eighteen individuals of high scientific standing , nominated by the CGPM to advise the CGPM on administrative and technical matters 
 International Bureau of Weights and Measures ( Bureau international des poids et mesures or BIPM ) – an international metrology centre at Sèvres in France that has custody of the International prototype kilogram , provides metrology services for the CGPM and CIPM , houses the secretariat for these organisations and hosts their formal meetings . Initially its prime metrological purpose was a periodic recalibration of national prototype metres and kilograms against the international prototype . 
 In 1921 , the Metre Convention was extended to include all physical units , including the ampere and others defined by the Fourth International Conference of Electricians in Chicago in 1893 , thereby enabling the CGPM to address inconsistencies in the way that the metric system had been used . 
 The official language of the Metre Convention is French and the definitive version of all official documents published by or on behalf of the CGPM is the French @-@ language version . 
 = = = Towards the SI = = = 
 At the close of the 19th century three different systems of units of measure existed for electrical measurements : a CGS @-@ based system for electrostatic units , also known as the Gaussian or ESU system , a CGS @-@ based system for electromechanical units ( EMU ) and an MKS @-@ based system ( " international system " ) for electrical distribution systems . Attempts to resolve the electrical units in terms of length , mass , and time using dimensional analysis was beset with difficulties — the dimensions depended on whether one used the ESU or EMU systems . This anomaly was resolved in 1900 when Giovanni Giorgi published a paper in which he advocated using a fourth base unit alongside the existing three base units . The fourth unit could be chosen to be electric current , voltage , or electrical resistance . 
 In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , a number of non @-@ coherent units of measure based on the gram / kilogram , the centimetre / metre , and the second , such as the <unk> ( metric horsepower ) for power , the <unk> for permeability and the use of " millimetres of mercury " for the measurement of both barometric and blood pressure were developed or propagated , some of which incorporated standard gravity in their definitions . 
 At the end of the Second World War , a number of different systems of measurement were in use throughout the world . Some of these systems were metric system variations , whereas others were based on customary systems of measure . In 1948 , after representations by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics ( IUPAP ) and by the French Government , the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures ( CGPM ) asked the International Committee for Weights and Measures ( CIPM ) to conduct an international study of the measurement needs of the scientific , technical , and educational communities and " to make recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement , suitable for adoption by all countries adhering to the Metre Convention " . 
 On the basis of the findings of this study , the 10th CGPM in 1954 decided that an international system should be derived from six base units to provide for the measurement of temperature and optical radiation in addition to mechanical and electromagnetic quantities . Six base units were recommended : the metre , kilogram , second , ampere , degree Kelvin ( later renamed kelvin ) , and candela . In 1960 , the 11th CGPM named the system the International System of Units , abbreviated SI from the French name , Le Système International d 'Unités . The BIPM has also described SI as " the modern metric system " . The seventh base unit , the mole , was added in 1971 by the 14th CGPM . 
 = = = International System of Quantities = = = 
 The International System of Quantities ( ISQ ) is a system based on seven base quantities : length , mass , time , electric current , thermodynamic temperature , amount of substance , and luminous intensity . Other quantities such as area , pressure , and electrical resistance are derived from these base quantities by clear non @-@ contradictory equations . The ISQ defines the quantities that are measured with the SI units . The ISQ is defined in the international standard ISO / IEC 80000 , and was finalised in 2009 with the publication of ISO 80000 @-@ 1 . 
 = = SI Brochure and conversion factors = = 
 The CGPM publishes a brochure which defines and presents SI . Its official version is in French , in line with the Metre Convention . It leaves some scope for local interpretation , particularly regarding names and terms in different languages , so for example the United States ' National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) has produced a version of the CGPM document ( NIST SP 330 ) which clarifies local interpretation for English @-@ language publications that use American English and another document ( NIST SP 811 ) that gives general guidance for the use of SI in the United States and conversion factors between SI and customary units . 
 The writing and maintenance of the CGPM brochure is carried out by one of the committees of the International Committee for Weights and Measures ( CIPM ) , the Consultative Committee for Units ( CCU ) . The CIPM nominates the chairman of this committee , but the committee includes representatives of various other international bodies rather than CIPM or CGPM nominees . This committee thus provides a forum for the bodies concerned to provide input to the CIPM in respect of ongoing enhancements to SI . 
 The definitions of the terms " quantity " , " unit " , " dimension " etc. that are used in the SI Brochure are those given in the International vocabulary of metrology , a publication produced by the Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology ( <unk> ) , a working group consisting of eight international standards organisations under the chairmanship of the director of the BIPM . The quantities and equations that define the SI units are now referred to as the International System of Quantities ( ISQ ) , and are set out in the International Standard ISO / IEC 80000 Quantities and Units . 
 = = Units and prefixes = = 
 The International System of Units consists of a set of base units , a set of derived units with special names , and a set of decimal @-@ based multipliers that are used as prefixes . The term SI Units covers all three categories , but the term coherent SI units includes only base units and coherent derived units . 
 = = = Base units = = = 
 The SI base units are the building blocks of the system and all other units are derived from them . When Maxwell first introduced the concept of a coherent system , he identified three quantities that could be used as base units : mass , length and time . Giorgi later identified the need for an electrical base unit . Theoretically any one of electric current , potential difference , electrical resistance , electrical charge or a number of other quantities could have provided the base unit , with the remaining units then being defined by the laws of physics . In the event , the unit of electric current was chosen for SI . Another three base units ( for temperature , substance and luminous intensity ) were added later . 
 = = = Derived units = = = 
 The derived units in the SI are formed by powers , products or quotients of the base units and are unlimited in number . Derived units are associated with derived quantities , for example velocity is a quantity that is derived from the base quantities of time and length , so in SI the derived unit is metres per second ( symbol m / s ) . The dimensions of derived units can be expressed in terms of the dimensions of the base units . 
 <unk> units are derived units that contain no numerical factor other than 1 — quantities such as standard gravity and density of water are absent from their definitions . In the example above , one newton is the force required to accelerate a mass of one kilogram by one metre per second squared . Since the SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m · s − 2 respectively and F ∝ m × a , the units of force ( and hence of newtons ) is formed by multiplication to give kg · m · s − 2 . Since the newton is part of a coherent set of units , the constant of proportionality is 1 . 
 For the sake of convenience , some derived units have special names and symbols . Such units may themselves be used in combination with the names and symbols for base units and for other derived units to express the units of other derived quantities . For example , the SI unit of force is the newton ( N ) , the SI unit of pressure is the pascal ( Pa ) — and the pascal can be defined as " newtons per square metre " ( N / m2 ) . 
 = = = Prefixes = = = 
 Prefixes are added to unit names to produce multiple and sub @-@ multiples of the original unit . All multiples are integer powers of ten , and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand . For example , kilo- denotes a multiple of a thousand and milli- denotes a multiple of a thousandth , so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre . The prefixes are never combined , so for example a millionth of a metre is a micrometre , not a <unk> . <unk> of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit , so a millionth of a kilogram is a milligram , not a <unk> . 
 = = = Non @-@ SI units accepted for use with SI = = = 
 Although , in theory , SI can be used for any physical measurement , the CIPM has recognised that some non @-@ SI units still appear in the scientific , technical , and commercial literature , and will continue to be used for many years to come . In addition , certain other units are so deeply embedded in the history and culture of the human race that they will continue to be used for the foreseeable future . The CIPM has catalogued several such units and published them in the SI Brochure so that their use may be consistent around the world . These units have been grouped as follows : 
 Non @-@ SI units accepted for use with the SI ( Table 6 ) : 
 Certain units of time , angle , and legacy non @-@ SI metric units have a long history of consistent use . Most of mankind has used the day and its non @-@ decimal subdivisions as a basis of time and , unlike the foot or the pound , these were the same regardless of where they were being measured . The radian , being 1 / 2π of a revolution , has mathematical advantages but it is cumbersome for navigation , and , as with time , the units used in navigation have a large degree of consistency around the world . The tonne , litre , and hectare were adopted by the CGPM in 1879 and have been retained as units that may be used alongside SI units , having been given unique symbols . The catalogued units are 
 minute , hour , day , degree of arc , minute of arc , second of arc , hectare , litre , tonne , astronomical unit and [ <unk> ] bel 
 Non @-@ SI units whose values in SI units must be obtained experimentally ( Table 7 ) . 
 Physicists often use units of measure that are based on natural phenomena , particularly when the quantities associated with these phenomena are many orders of magnitude greater than or less than the equivalent SI unit . The most common ones have been catalogued in the SI Brochure together with consistent symbols and accepted values , but with the caveat that their physical values need to be <unk> , dalton / unified atomic mass unit , Planck constant , and electron mass 
 Other non @-@ SI units ( Table 8 ) : 
 A number of non @-@ SI units that had never been formally sanctioned by the CGPM have continued to be used across the globe in many spheres including health care and navigation . As with the units of measure in Tables 6 and 7 , these have been catalogued by the CIPM in the SI Brochure to ensure consistent usage , but with the recommendation that authors who use them should define them wherever they are used . 
 bar , millimetre of mercury , ångström , nautical mile , barn , knot and <unk> 
 Non @-@ SI units associated with the CGS and the CGS @-@ Gaussian system of units ( Table 9 ) 
 The SI manual also catalogues a number of legacy units of measure that are used in specific fields such as geodesy and geophysics or are found in the literature , particularly in classical and relativistic electrodynamics where they have certain advantages : The units that are catalogued are : 
 erg , dyne , poise , stokes , <unk> , <unk> , gal , maxwell , gauss , and <unk> . 
 = = Writing unit symbols and the values of quantities = = 
 Before 1948 , the writing of metric quantities was haphazard . In 1879 , the CIPM published recommendations for writing the symbols for length , area , volume and mass , but it was outside its domain to publish recommendations for other quantities . Beginning in about 1900 , physicists who had been using the symbol " μ " for " micrometre " ( or " micron " ) , " λ " for " microlitre " , and " γ " for " microgram " started to use the symbols " μm " , " <unk> " and " μg " , but it was only in 1935 , a decade after the revision of the Metre Convention that the CIPM formally adopted this proposal and recommended that the symbol " μ " be used universally as a prefix for 10 − 6 . 
 In 1948 , the ninth CGPM approved the first formal recommendation for the writing of symbols in the metric system when the basis of the rules as they are now known was laid down . These rules were subsequently extended by International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) and the International Electrotechnical Commission ( IEC ) and now cover unit symbols and names , prefix symbols and names , how quantity symbols should be written and used and how the values of quantities should be expressed . Both ISO and the IEC have published rules for the presentation of SI units that are generally compatible with those published in the SI Brochure . As of August 2013 ISO and IEC were in the process of merging their standards for quantities and units into a single set of compatible documents identified as the ISO / IEC 80000 Standard . The rules covering printing of quantities and units are part of ISO 80000 @-@ 1 : 2009 . 
 = = = Unit names = = = 
 Names of units follow the grammatical rules associated with common nouns : in English and in French they start with a lowercase letter ( e.g. , newton , hertz , pascal ) , even when the symbol for the unit begins with a capital letter . This also applies to " degrees Celsius " , since " degree " is the unit . In German , however , the names of units , as with all German nouns , start with capital letters . The spelling of unit names is a matter for the guardians of the language concerned – the official British and American spellings for certain SI units differ – British English , as well as Australian , Canadian and New Zealand English , uses the spelling <unk> , metre , and litre whereas American English uses the spelling <unk> , meter , and liter , respectively . 
 Likewise , the plural forms of units follow the grammar of the language concerned : in English , the normal rules of English grammar are used , e.g. " <unk> " is the plural of " henry " . However , the units lux , hertz , and siemens have irregular plurals in that they remain the same in both their singular and plural form . 
 In English , when unit names are combined to denote multiplication of the units concerned , they are separated with a hyphen or a space ( e.g. newton @-@ metre or newton metre ) . The plural is formed by converting the last unit name to the plural form ( e.g. ten newton @-@ metres ) . 
 = = = Unit names as adjectives = = = 
 In English , a space is recommended between the number and the unit symbol when used as an adjective , e.g. " a 25 kg sphere " . 
 The normal rules of English apply to unit names , where a hyphen is incorporated into the adjectival sense , e.g. " a 25 @-@ kilogram sphere " . 
 = = = Chinese and Japanese = = = 
 Chinese uses traditional logograms for writing the unit names , while in Japanese unit names are written in the phonetic katakana script ; in both cases , symbols are also written using the internationally recognised Latin and Greek characters . 
 Chinese 
 The basic Chinese units are metre ( 米 <unk> ) , litre ( <unk> <unk> ) , gram ( <unk> kè ) , and second ( <unk> <unk> ) , while others include watt ( <unk> <unk> ) . Prefixes include deci- ( 分 <unk> ) , centi- ( 厘 <unk> ) , milli- ( <unk> <unk> ) , micro- ( <unk> <unk> ) , kilo- ( 千 <unk> ) , and mega- ( <unk> <unk> ) . These are combined to form disyllabic characters , such as <unk> <unk> " centimetre " or 千瓦 <unk> " kilowatt " . In the 19th century , various compound characters were also used , similar to Japanese , either imported or formed on the same principles , such as <unk> for 千瓦 <unk> ( kilowatt ) or <unk> for <unk> . These are generally not used today , but are occasionally found in older or technical writing . 
 Some units have different names in Taiwan . Meter ( <unk> ) , centimeter ( <unk> ) , liter ( <unk> ) , kilogram ( <unk> ) , gram ( <unk> ) and hectare ( <unk> ) have the prefix " <unk> " , which means " universal " . The prefixes " <unk> " , " 分 " and " 厘 " are not commonly used , and the use of " 千 " is limited to kilowatt ( 千瓦 ) . 
 Japanese 
 A set of characters representing various metric units was created in Japan in the late 19th century . Characters , same as the Chinese , exist for three base units : the metre ( 米 ) , litre ( <unk> ) and gram ( <unk> ) . These were combined with a set of six prefix characters – kilo- ( 千 ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , deci- ( 分 ) , centi- ( 厘 ) and milli- ( <unk> ) – to form an additional 18 single @-@ character units . The seven length units ( kilometre to millimetre ) , for example , are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , 米 , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . These characters , however , are not in common use today ; instead , units are written in katakana , the Japanese syllabary used for foreign borrowings , such as <unk> ( <unk> ) for kilometre , but are also written in standard prefixes such as " km " for kilometre . A few Sino @-@ Japanese words for these units remain in use in Japanese , most significantly " <unk> " ( <unk> ) for " square metre " , but otherwise borrowed pronunciations are used . 
 These characters are examples of the rare phenomenon of single @-@ character loan words – a foreign word represented by a single Japanese character – and form the plurality of such words . Similar characters were also coined for other units , such as British units , though these also have fallen out of use ; see Single character <unk> : Metric units and Single character <unk> : Other units for a full list . 
 = = = Unit symbols and the values of quantities = = = 
 Although the writing of unit names is language @-@ specific , the writing of unit symbols and the values of quantities is consistent across all languages and therefore the SI Brochure has specific rules in respect of writing them . The guideline produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) clarifies language @-@ specific areas in respect of American English that were left open by the SI Brochure , but is otherwise identical to the SI Brochure . 
 = = = = General rules = = = = 
 General rules for writing SI units and quantities apply to text that is either handwritten or produced using an automated process : 
 The value of a quantity is written as a number followed by a space ( representing a multiplication sign ) and a unit symbol ; e.g. , 2 @.@ 21 kg , 7 @.@ 3 × 102 m2 , 22 K. This rule explicitly includes the percent sign ( % ) and the symbol for degrees of temperature ( ° C ) . Exceptions are the symbols for plane angular degrees , minutes , and seconds ( ° , ′ , and ″ ) , which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space . 
 Symbols are mathematical entities , not abbreviations , and as such do not have an appended period / full stop ( . ) , unless the rules of grammar demand one for another reason , such as denoting the end of a sentence . 
 A prefix is part of the unit , and its symbol is <unk> to the unit symbol without a separator ( e.g. , k in km , M in MPa , G in GHz ) . Compound prefixes are not allowed . 
 Symbols for derived units formed by multiplication are joined with a centre dot ( · ) or a non @-@ breaking space ; e.g. , N · m or N m . 
 Symbols for derived units formed by division are joined with a solidus ( / ) , or given as a negative exponent . E.g. , the " metre per second " can be written m / s , m s − 1 , m · s − 1 , or m / s . Only one solidus should be used ; e.g. , kg / ( m · s2 ) and kg · m − 1 · s − 2 are acceptable , but kg / m / s2 is ambiguous and unacceptable . 
 The first letter of symbols for units derived from the name of a person is written in upper case ; otherwise , they are written in lower case . E.g. , the unit of pressure is named after Blaise Pascal , so its symbol is written " Pa " , but the symbol for mole is written " mol " . Thus , " T " is the symbol for tesla , a measure of magnetic field strength , and " t " the symbol for tonne , a measure of mass . Since 1979 , the litre may exceptionally be written using either an uppercase " L " or a lowercase " l " , a decision prompted by the similarity of the lowercase letter " l " to the numeral " 1 " , especially with certain typefaces or English @-@ style handwriting . The American NIST recommends that within the United States " L " be used rather than " l " . 
 Symbols of units do not have a plural form ; e.g. , 25 kg , not 25 <unk> . 
 <unk> and lowercase prefixes are not interchangeable . E.g. , the quantities 1 mW and 1 MW represent two different quantities ; the former is the typical power requirement of a hearing aid ( 1 <unk> or 0 @.@ 001 watts ) , and the latter the typical power requirement of a suburban train ( 1 megawatt or 1000000 watts ) . 
 The 10th resolution of CGPM in 2003 declared that " the symbol for the decimal marker shall be either the point on the line or the comma on the line . " In practice , the decimal point is used in English @-@ speaking countries and most of Asia , and the comma in most of Latin America and in continental European languages . 
 Spaces should be used as a thousands separator ( 1000000 ) in contrast to commas or periods ( 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 or 1 @.@ 000 @.@ 000 ) to reduce confusion resulting from the variation between these forms in different countries . 
 Any line @-@ break inside a number , inside a compound unit , or between number and unit should be avoided . Where this is not possible , line breaks should coincide with thousands separators . 
 Since the value of " billion " and " trillion " can vary from language to language , the dimensionless terms " ppb " ( parts per billion ) and " ppt " ( parts per trillion ) should be avoided . No alternative is suggested in the SI Brochure . 
 = = = = Printing SI symbols = = = = 
 Further rules are specified in respect of production of text using printing presses , word processors , typewriters and the like . 
 Symbols are written in upright ( Roman ) type ( m for metres , s for seconds ) , so as to differentiate from the italic type used for quantities ( m for mass , s for displacement ) . By consensus of international standards bodies , this rule is applied independent of the font used for surrounding text . 
 In Chinese , Japanese , and Korean language computing ( CJK ) , some of the commonly used units , prefix – unit combinations , or unit – exponent combinations have been allocated predefined single characters taking up a full square . Unicode includes these in its CJK Compatibility and letter @-@ like symbols sub @-@ ranges for back compatibility , without necessarily recommending future usage . These are summarised in Unicode symbols . The cursive ℓ , a letter @-@ like symbol , has been used in a number of countries in addition to China and Japan as a symbol for the litre , but this is not currently recommended by any standards body . 
 In print , the space used as a thousands separator ( commonly called a thin space ) is typically narrower than that used between words . 
 = = Realisation of units = = 
 <unk> carefully distinguish between the definition of a unit and its realisation . The definition of each base unit of the SI is drawn up so that it is unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made . The realisation of the definition of a unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit . A description of the mise en pratique of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the SI Brochure . 
 The published mise en pratique is not the only way in which a base unit can be determined : the SI Brochure states that " any method consistent with the laws of physics could be used to realise any SI unit . " In the current ( 2016 ) exercise to overhaul the definitions of the base units , various consultative committees of the CIPM have required that more than one mise en pratique shall be developed for determining the value of each unit . In particular : 
 At least three separate experiments be carried out yielding values having a relative standard uncertainty in the determination of the kilogram of no more than 5 × 10 − 8 and at least one of these values should be better than 2 × 10 − 8 . Both the Watt balance and the Avogadro project should be included in the experiments and any differences between these be reconciled . 
 When the kelvin is being determined , the relative uncertainty of the Boltzmann constant derived from two fundamentally different methods such as acoustic gas thermometry and dielectric constant gas thermometry be better than one part in 10 − 6 and that these values be corroborated by other measurements . 
 = = Post @-@ 1960 changes = = 
 The preamble to the Metre Convention read " Desiring the international uniformity and precision in standards of weight and measure , have resolved to conclude a convention ... " . Changing technology has led to an evolution of the definitions and standards that has followed two principal strands – changes to SI itself and clarification of how to use units of measure that are not part of SI , but are still nevertheless used on a worldwide basis . 
 = = = Changes to the SI = = = 
 Since 1960 the CGPM has made a number of changes to SI . These include : 
 The 13th CGPM ( 1967 ) renamed the " degree Kelvin " ( symbol ° K ) to the " kelvin " ( symbol K ) 
 The 14th CGPM ( 1971 ) added the mole ( symbol mol ) to the list of base units . 
 The 14th GCPM ( 1971 ) added the pascal ( symbol Pa ) for pressure and the siemens ( symbol S ) for electrical conductance to the list of named derived units . 
 The 15th CGPM ( 1975 ) added the becquerel ( symbol Bq ) for " activity referred to a radionuclide " and the gray ( symbol Gy ) for ionizing radiation to the list of named derived units 
 In order to distinguish between " absorbed dose " and " dose equivalent " , the 16th CGPM ( 1979 ) added the sievert ( symbol Sv ) to the list of named derived units as the unit of dose equivalent . 
 The 16th CGPM ( 1979 ) clarified that in a break with convention either the letter " L " or the letter " l " may be used as a symbol for the litre . 
 The 21st CGPM ( 1999 ) added the <unk> ( symbol kat ) for catalytic activity to the list of named derived units . 
 In its original form ( 1960 ) , the SI defined prefixes for values ranging from <unk> ( symbol p ) having a value of 10 − 12 to <unk> ( symbol T ) having a value of 1012 . The list was extended at the 12th CGPM ( 1964 ) , at the 15th CGPM ( 1975 ) and at the 19th CGPM ( 1991 ) to give the current range of prefixes . 
 In addition , advantage was taken of developments in technology to redefine many of the base units enabling the use of higher precision techniques . 
 = = = Retention of non @-@ SI units = = = 
 Although , in theory , SI can be used for any physical measurement , it is recognised that some non @-@ SI units still appear in the scientific , technical and commercial literature , and will continue to be used for many years to come . In addition , certain other units are so deeply embedded in the history and culture of the human race that they will continue to be used for the foreseeable future . The CIPM has catalogued such units and included them in the SI Brochure so that they can be used consistently . 
 The first such group comprises the units of time and of angles and certain legacy non @-@ SI metric units . Most of mankind has used the day and its subdivisions as a basis of time with the result that the second , minute , hour and day , unlike the foot or the pound , were the same regardless of where it was being measured . The second has been catalogued as an SI unit , its multiples as units of measure that may be used alongside the SI . The measurement of angles has likewise had a long history of consistent use – the radian , being 1 / 2π of a revolution , has mathematical niceties , but it is cumbersome for navigation , hence the retention of the degree , minute and second of arc . The tonne , litre and hectare were adopted by the CGPM in 1879 and have been retained as units that may be used alongside SI units , having been given unique symbols . 
 Physicists often use units of measure that are based on natural phenomena such as the speed of light , the mass of a proton ( approximately one dalton ) , the charge of an electron and the like . These too have been catalogued in the SI Brochure with consistent symbols , but with the caveat that their physical values need to be measured . 
 In the interests of standardising health @-@ related units of measure used in the nuclear industry , the 12th CGPM ( 1964 ) accepted the continued use of the curie ( symbol Ci ) as a non @-@ SI unit of activity for radionuclides ; the becquerel , sievert and gray were adopted in later years . Similarly , the millimetre of mercury ( symbol mmHg ) was retained for measuring blood pressure . 
 = = Global adoption = = 
 SI has become the world 's most widely used system of measurement , used in both everyday commerce and science . The change to SI had little effect on everyday life in countries that used the metric system – the metre , kilogram , litre and second remained unchanged as did the way in which they were used – most of the changes only affected measurements in the workplace . The CGPM has a role of recommending changes , but no formal role in the enforcement of such changes — another inter @-@ governmental organisation , the International Organization of Legal Metrology ( <unk> ) provides a forum for harmonisation of national standards and legislation in respect of metrology . 
 Both the degree and rate of adoption of SI varied from country to country — countries that had not adopted the metric system by 1960 and subsequently adopted SI did so directly as part of their metrication programs while others migrated from the CGS system of units to SI . In 1960 , the world 's largest economy was that of the United States , followed by the United Kingdom , West Germany , France , Japan , China and India . The United States and the United Kingdom were non @-@ metric , France and Germany had been using the metric system for about a century , and China had been using the metric system for 35 years , while India and Japan had adopted the metric system within the preceding five years . Other non @-@ metric countries were those where the United Kingdom or the United States had considerable influence . These differences are brought out in the examples below : 
 = = = United Kingdom and the former British Empire = = = 
 Even though the use of metric units was legalised for trade in the UK in 1864 , the UK had signed the Metre Convention in 1884 and the UK Parliament had defined the yard and the pound in terms of the metre and the kilogram in 1897 , the UK continued to use the imperial system of measure and to export the imperial system of units to the Empire . In 1932 , the system of Imperial Preference was set up at the Ottawa Conference . Although Ireland left the Commonwealth in 1948 and South Africa in 1961 , both continued their close economic ties with the Commonwealth . 
 When the SI standard was published in 1960 , the only major Commonwealth country to have adopted the metric system was India . In 1863 , the first reading of a bill that would have made the metric system compulsory passed its first reading in the House of Commons by 110 votes to 75 . The bill , however , failed to make the statute book because of lack of parliamentary time . In 1965 , after this and similar false starts the then Federation of British Industry informed the British Government that its members favoured the adoption of the metric system . The rationale behind the request was that 80 % of British exports were to countries that used the metric system or that were considering changing to the metric system . The Board of Trade , on behalf of the Government , agreed to support a ten @-@ year metrication programme . The government agreed to a voluntary policy requiring minimal legislation and costs to be borne where they fell . SI would be used from the outset . The rest of the Commonwealth , South Africa and Ireland followed within a few years ; in some countries such as South Africa and Australia metrication was mandatory rather than voluntary . 
 By 1980 all apart from the United Kingdom , Canada and Ireland had effectively completed their programs . In the United Kingdom the breakdown of voluntary metrication in the mid @-@ 1970s coincided with the United Kingdom 's obligations as part of the EEC to adopt the metric system , resulting in legislation to force metrication in certain areas and the Eurosceptic movement adopting an anti @-@ metrication stance and the United Kingdom seeking a number of <unk> from the relevant EEC directives . Once the metrication of most consumer goods was completed in 2000 , aspects of British life , especially in government , commerce and industry used SI . Although imperial units are widely encountered in unregulated areas such as the press and everyday speech , SI or units approved for use alongside SI are used in most areas where units of measure are regulated . High @-@ profile exceptions include the sale of draught beer , the sale of milk in returnable containers , and United Kingdom road signs . Irish road signs ( road distances and speeds ) were converted to metric units during the first decade of the 21st century ; otherwise , the situation in Ireland is similar to that in the United Kingdom . 
 Canada has adopted it for most purposes , but imperial units are still legally permitted and remain in common use throughout a few sectors of Canadian society , particularly in the buildings , trades and railways sectors . 
 = = = European Union = = = 
 In 1960 , all the largest industrialised nations that had an established history of using the metric system were members of the European Economic Community ( EEC ) . 
 In 1972 , in order to harmonise units of measure as part of a programme to facilitate trade between member states , the EEC issued directive 71 / 354 / EEC . This directive catalogued units of measure that could be used for " economic , public health , public safety and administrative purposes " and also provided instructions for a transition from the existing units of measure that were in use . The directive replicated the CGPM SI recommendations and in addition pre @-@ empted some of the additions whose use had been recommended by the CIPM in 1969 , but had not been ratified by the CGPM . The directive also catalogued units of measure whose status would be reviewed by the end of 1977 ( mainly coherent CGS units of measure ) and also catalogued units of measure that were to be phased out by the end of 1977 , including the use of obsolete names for the sale of timber such as the <unk> , the use of units of force and pressure that made use of the acceleration due to gravity , the use of non @-@ coherent units of power such as the <unk> ( PS ) , the use of the calorie as a measure of energy and the <unk> as a measure of luminance . The directive was silent in respect of units that were specific to one or two countries including the pond , <unk> , livre ( Dutch , German and French synonyms for 500 g ) , thereby effectively prohibiting their use as well . 
 When the directive was revisited during 1977 , some of the older units that were being reviewed ( such as millimetre of mercury for blood pressure ) were retained but others were phased out , thereby broadly aligning the allowable units with SI . The directive was however overhauled to accommodate British and Irish interests in retaining the imperial system in certain circumstances . It was reissued as directive 80 / 181 / EEC . During subsequent revisions , the directive has reflected changes in the definition of SI . The directive also formalised the use of supplementary units , which in 1979 were permitted for a period of ten years . The cut @-@ off date for the use of supplementary units was extended a number of times and in 2009 was extended indefinitely . 
 = = = India = = = 
 India was one of the last countries to start a metrication programme before the advent of SI . When it became independent in 1947 , both imperial and native units of measure were in use . Its metrication programme started in 1956 with the passing of the Standards of Weights and Measures Act . Part of the act fixed the value of the seer ( a legacy unit of mass ) to 0 @.@ <unk> kg exactly ; elsewhere the Act declared that from 1960 all non @-@ metric units of measure were to be illegal . 
 Four years after the Indian Government announced its metrication programme , SI was published . The result was that the initial metrication programme was a conversion to the CGS system of units and the subsequent adoption of SI has been haphazard . Fifty years later , many of the country 's schoolbooks still use CGS or imperial units . Originally the Indian Government had planned to replace all units of measure with metric units by 1960 . In 1976 a new Weights and Measures Act replaced the 1956 Act which , amongst other things , required that all weighing devices be approved before being released onto the market place . However , in 2012 , it was reported that traditional units were still encountered in small manufacturing establishments and in the marketplace alongside CGS , SI and imperial measures , particularly in the poorer areas . 
 The use of the Indian numbering system of crores ( <unk> ) and lakhs ( 100000 ) , which do not map onto the SI system of prefixes , is widespread and is often found alongside or in place of the western numbering system . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 Even though Congress set up a framework for the use of the metric system in the nineteenth century , the United States continues to use US customary units , based on English measure passed by parliament under the reign of Queen Anne in 1706 , for most purposes apart from science and medicine . In Puerto Rico , metric units are widely used due to the vast majority of the population having Spanish heritage . 
 On 10 February 1964 , the National Bureau of Standards ( now the National Institute of Standards and Technology ) issued a statement that it was to use SI except where this would have an obvious detrimental effect . In 1968 Congress authorised the U.S. Metric Study the emphasis of which was to examine the feasibility of adopting SI . The first volume was delivered in 1970 . The study recommended that the United States adopt the International System of units , and in 1975 Congress passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 which established a national policy of coordinating and planning for the increased use of the metric measurement system in the United States . Metrication was voluntary and to be coordinated by the United States Metric Board ( <unk> ) . 
 Efforts during the Ford and Carter administrations to force metrication were seized on by many newspaper editorialists as being dictatorial . Public response included resistance , apathy , and sometimes ridicule . The underlying reasons for this response include a relative uniformity of weights and measures ( though , notably , US liquid measure differed by about 20 % from British Imperial measure , which was adopted throughout the British Empire in 1824 ) inherited from the United Kingdom in 1776 , a homogeneous economy and the influence of business groups and populists in Congress caused the country to look at the short @-@ term costs associated with the change @-@ over , particularly those that would be borne by the consumer rather than long @-@ term benefits of efficiency and international trade . The Metrication Board was disbanded under President Ronald Reagan 's direction in 1982 . 
 The 1988 Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act removed international trade barriers and amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 , designating the metric system as " the Preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce " . The legislation stated that the federal government has a responsibility to assist industry , especially small business , as it voluntarily converts to the metric system of measurement . Exceptions were made for the highway and construction industries ; the Department of Transportation planned to require metric units by 2000 , but this plan was cancelled by the 1998 highway bill <unk> . However , the US military uses the metric system widely , partly because of the need to work with armed services from other nations . Although overall responsibility for labelling requirements of consumer goods lies with Congress and is therefore covered by federal law , details of labelling requirements for certain commodities are controlled by state law or by other authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration , Environmental Protection Agency and Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau . The federal Fair Packaging and Labeling Act ( <unk> ) , originally passed in 1964 , was amended in 1992 to require consumer goods directly under its jurisdiction to be labelled in both customary and metric units . Some industries are engaged in efforts to amend this law to allow manufacturers to use only metric labelling . The National Conference on Weights and Measures has developed the Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulations ( UPLR ) which provides a standard approach to those sections of packaging law that are under state control . Acceptance of the UPLR varies from state to state – fourteen states accept it by merely citing it in their legislation . 
 During the first decade of the 21st century , the EU directive 80 / 181 / EEC had required that dual unit labelling of goods sold within the EU cease by the end of 2009 . This was backed up by requests from other nations including Japan and New Zealand to permit metric @-@ only labelling as an aid to trade with those countries . Opinion in the United States was split – a bill to permit metric @-@ only labelling at the federal level was to have been introduced in 2005 but significant opposition from the Food Marketing Institute , representing US grocers , has delayed the introduction of the bill . During a routine decennial review of the directive in 2008 , the EU postponed the sunset clause for dual units indefinitely . 
 Meanwhile , in 1999 the UPLR was amended to permit metric @-@ only labelling and automatically became law in those states that accept UPLR " as is " . By 1 January 2009 , 48 out of 50 states permit metric @-@ only labelling , either through UPLR or through their own legislation . As of February 2013 the use of metric ( and therefore SI ) units in the United States does not follow any pattern . Dual @-@ unit labelling on consumer goods is mandatory . Some consumer goods such as soft drinks are sold in metric quantities , but milk is sold in customary units . The engineering industry is equally split . The automotive industry is largely metric , but aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner were designed using customary units . 
 = = <unk> of units = = 
 After the metre was redefined in 1960 , the kilogram remained the only SI base unit that relied on a specific physical artifact , the international prototype of the kilogram ( IPK ) , for its definition and thus the only unit that was still subject to periodic comparisons of national standard kilograms with the IPK . After the 1996 – 1998 recalibration , a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed . 
 At its 23rd meeting , held in 2007 , the CGPM recommended that the CIPM should continue to investigate methods to provide exact fixed values for physical constants of nature that could then be used in the definitions of units of measure in place of the IPK , thus enabling the transition from explicit unit definitions to explicit constant definitions . 
 At a meeting of the CCU held in Reading , United Kingdom , in September 2010 , a resolution and draft changes to the SI Brochure that were to be presented to the next meeting of the CIPM in October 2010 were agreed to in principle . The proposals that the CCU put forward were : 
 In addition to the speed of light , four constants of nature – the Planck constant , an elementary charge , the Boltzmann constant and the Avogadro number – be defined to have exact values . 
 The International prototype kilogram be retired 
 The current definitions of the kilogram , ampere , kelvin and mole be revised . 
 The wording of the definitions of all the base units be both tightened up and changed to reflect the change in emphasis from explicit unit to explicit constant definitions . 
 The CIPM meeting of October 2010 reviewed progress towards establishing fixed values for the constants but found that " the conditions set by the General Conference at its 23rd meeting have not yet been fully met . For this reason the CIPM does not propose a revision of the SI at the present time " . 
 At the 24th CGPM meeting , held in October 2011 , the CIPM sponsored a resolution in which the requisite definition changes were agreed to in principle and in which the conditions required to be met before the redefinitions could be implemented were restated . 
 By November 2014 the conditions set out at the 23rd meeting of the CGPM for the unit redefinitions had still not been met , and the 25th meeting of the CGPM , held in November 2014 , adopted a similar resolution encouraging further work towards establishing fixed values for the fundamental constants . 
 The redefinitions are expected to be adopted at the 26th CGPM in the fall of 2018 . The CODATA task group on fundamental constants has announced special submission deadlines for data to compute the values that will be announced at this event . 
 = Drowned World Tour = 
 Drowned World Tour was the fifth concert tour by American singer @-@ songwriter Madonna in support of her seventh and eighth studio albums Ray of Light and Music . It was also her first tour in eight years , following The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993 . The tour was supposed to start in 1999 , but was delayed until 2001 as Madonna gave birth to her son , got married to Guy Ritchie , was working on Music , and was busy filming The Next Best Thing . When the tour was decided , Madonna appointed Jamie King as choreographer and the tour was planned in a short timespan of three months , including signing up the dancers , musicians and technicians . Designer Jean @-@ Paul Gaultier was the costume designer who designed the costumes in such way that they indicated different phases of Madonna 's career . The poster and logo for the tour included references to Kabbalah , which Madonna studied . 
 The show was divided into five segments , namely Cyber @-@ Punk , Geisha , Cowgirl , Spanish , and Ghetto . The setlist consisted mainly of songs from the last two studio albums released at that point , with two pre @-@ 1990s song added . The first segment displayed high @-@ energy performances with Madonna wearing a kilt and dominatrix style costumes . In the geisha segment performances Madonna wore a kimono and later performed airborne martial arts . Acoustic songs were performed in the country segment which featured Madonna in cowboy costumes . The Latin segment featured flamenco dancing and the last segment featured ghetto @-@ themed performances . Drowned World Tour was critically appreciated from contemporary critics who complimented her ability to re @-@ invent continuously . 
 The tour was a commercial success . It went on to become the highest @-@ grossing concert tour of 2001 by a solo artist . She grossed more than US $ 76 @.@ 8 million ( $ 102 @.@ 64 million in 2016 dollars ) , selling out summer shows and eventually playing in front of 730 @,@ 000 fans throughout the United States and Europe . It received Major Tour of the Year and Most Creative Stage Production awards nominations at the 2001 Pollstar awards , but lost them to U2 . The concert was broadcast live on HBO from The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills , Michigan on August 26 , 2001 . A DVD titled Drowned World Tour 2001 was released in November 2001 .

 After the release of her seventh studio album Ray of Light ( 1998 ) , Madonna stated in a live interview with Larry King on January 19 , 1999 that " I am going to do a movie in April ; The Next Best Thing , and then I am going to rehearse to go on tour . And then I 'll probably play up until the millennium , New Year 's Eve . " The tour was delayed until 2001 , as she had , in her own words , " been distracted by having children and filming movies " . She also began a serious relationship with Guy Ritchie in 1999 . By 2000 , she had become pregnant with her son Rocco Ritchie , released her eighth studio album Music that year , and married Ritchie in December 2000 . 
 When Madonna finally decided to go on the tour , time was short and she had to prepare the show within three months . Auditioning for the dancers started around March 2001 . Jamie King was signed up as the creative director and the choreographer of the show . King said in an interview that the tour " was so hectic that I suffered from depressions and fell considerably ill . " Rehearsals continued for thirteen hours a day , five days a week , with more and more dancers joining for the show . In the end , ten dancers and two backup singers were used . Madonna had her guitarist Monte Pittman teach her to play the instrument , and she played both acoustic and electric guitar live in the show . French house music expert Stuart Price , who had worked with Madonna on remixes of her album Music , was signed as bassist and keyboards player . Clair Brothers Audio support was roped in for providing a mixture of high @-@ tech techno sound and fusion of acoustic and trance . Madonna clarified : " I don 't see the point of doing a show unless you offer something that is going to mind @-@ <unk> the senses . It 's not enough to get on stage and sing a song . It 's all about theatre and drama and surprises and <unk> . " 
 The Drowned World Tour was originally scheduled to begin with two shows in the <unk> in Cologne , Germany but both concerts had to be canceled due to technical difficulties . As a result , 35 @,@ 000 tickets were refunded . Her show of August 3 at the Continental Airlines Arena in New Jersey was also cancelled , this time due to illness . Therefore , total tour dates numbered forty @-@ seven instead of fifty .

 The tour was divided into five segments , namely Cyber @-@ Punk , Geisha , Cowgirl , Spanish and Ghetto . Each segment represented a phase of Madonna 's career . Madonna 's publicist Liz <unk> announced that the tour was designed as the grandest spectacle amongst all the other Madonna tours . Designer Jean @-@ Paul Gaultier was signed up to create the costumes for the tour . He came up with the concept of creating the costumes of the tour as a fusion of punk and Scottish fashions . Other costumes designed by Gaultier had geisha , cowboy and Spanish themes in them . Other designers associated with the tour included Dean and Dan Caten , <unk> of the DSquared2 fashion line . The dresses developed included a torn shirt and zippered black pants , indicating the early days of her career , and leather <unk> jeans and ghetto fabulous costumes , indicating the phase of her career at that point of time . Black wigs and white makeup would demonstrate the Ray of Light and the geisha themes . A hybrid of clothes from the music video of the Madonna song " La Isla Bonita " ( 1987 ) and the 1996 Madonna starring musical Evita were also created . The setlist for the show consisted mainly of songs from the last two studio albums Ray of Light and Music . Among her pre @-@ 1990s hits , only " Holiday " and " La Isla Bonita " were added to the set list . Dave Kob , FOH engineer for the tour , commented that , 
 " The show is extremely technical , extremely fast @-@ paced , and the variety of music is amazing . [ ... ] It goes from screaming heavy metal to techno dance , to Country and Western ; there 's even a flamenco hootenanny where everyone comes down front , beats on logs and plays acoustic guitars and <unk> . Then it goes back to ' Holiday ' which is an old dance number . It keeps you steppin ' . Madonna sings everything live . She 's been that way from the beginning of her career , even with all the athletic dancing . She 's a hard worker and she expects everybody else to work as hard or harder . I respect that . " 
 The stage was as huge as a tennis court and was made movable . Above the stage was a vast electrical grid , composed of truss sections , chain motors , cabling and the control devices that linked electronically or mechanically with the performances happening below . Four gigantic video monitors formed the backdrop of the stage . Other equipment included a mechanical bull and equipment for aerial movements . The sets were built in sections by three companies . A permanent crew of around hundred was hired . Monitor mixing was handled by four monitor engineers , with two of them for Madonna 's monitors . Blake Suib , one of the engineers , commented that Madonna was a perfectionist and she knew when a sound , coming from the speakers , sounded bad or good during rehearsals . By the suggestion of music director Pat Leonard , they tried out using 14 kHz of sound frequency in their live speakers , which was unusual to use at that point of time . Also they came up with the idea of using isolated amplifiers to pick up the sound of the instruments individually . Suib commented that " the creative process of coming up with new ideas , implementing them , and then soberly evaluating their results was time @-@ consuming but worth it . " The poster and the logo for the tour was developed by Chase Design Group . They wanted to make the logo as much aesthetic as possible . They developed a custom icon and logo type to convey the unique and ethereal qualities of Madonna 's show , which was described by the group 's founder Margo Chase as " a multilayered musical and spiritual journey through diverse worlds . " Chase commented that since " Madonna is a student of Kabbalah , she requested that we include references to that body of knowledge . " The resulting logo and poster included both Arabic and Hebrew references . A number of designs were prepared by Chase and the one ultimately chosen by Madonna made it to the main poster of the show , which featured Madonna 's face @-@ shot from the " What It Feels Like for a Girl " video shots .

 The show was divided into five sections : Cyber @-@ Punk , Geisha , Cowgirl , Spanish and Ghetto . It began with a dramatic performance of " Drowned World / Substitute For Love " ; Madonna entered amidst billows of dry ice , dressed in a sleeveless black top , crossover top with one net sleeve , jeans with zips and bondage straps , a studded dog collar and a tartan kilt . She performed the song standing on the middle platform of the stage . Afterwards a chaotic cyberpunk @-@ themed performance of " Impressive Instant " started , with dancers in gas masks and headlights . She then played guitar for " Candy Perfume Girl " , leading to the performance of " Beautiful Stranger " featuring a lost stage technician . Backdrops displayed scenes from the movie Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged Me and psychedelic fluorescent whirls . The first section finished with " Ray of Light " where Madonna danced energetically across the stage . 
 The second segment opened with a video interlude of " Paradise ( Not for Me ) " and had nearly naked dancers hanging upside down from the ceiling . As the video ended , the dancers stood in front of the stage opening their mouth which was lit from inside . Madonna appeared on the stage wearing a short black wig and a hand @-@ painted kimono with fifty @-@ two @-@ feet long <unk> , to sing " Frozen " . The backdrops display silhouettes of burning trees against racing , blood @-@ red clouds . A short intro of " Open Your Heart " lead to " Nobody 's Perfect " where Madonna was portrayed to be sacrificed for her sins . This was followed by " Mer Girl " which turned into the fast @-@ action , ninja / samurai martial arts battle performance of " Sky Fits Heaven " , transforming back into the slow @-@ tempo " Mer Girl " . This section was inspired by the Chinese film Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ( 2000 ) . Madonna 's battered and bruised face is shown in the backdrops as she emerged with a shotgun from the battle on stage and shot her dancer . As Madonna disappeared into the floor , a violent , sexually explicit Japanese animation dance remix interlude of " What It Feels Like for a Girl " was shown , featuring footage from the Japanese anime film Perfect Blue ( 1997 ) . 
 Madonna appeared as a cowgirl , wearing a stars and stripes vest , for an acoustic guitar performance of " I Deserve It " and dedicated it to her then husband Guy Ritchie . This was followed by line dancing with her dancers dressed as cowboys during " Don 't Tell Me " where she accessorized herself with a raccoon 's tail . For " Human Nature " , she rode a mechanical bull . After the performance , she addressed the audience in a mocking southern accent and sang a macabre themed song titled " The Funny Song " . The next song was " Secret " , which featured scenes of riverside baptism , Sufi dervish ceremonies and Buddhist prayers in the backdrops . She finished off the segment with " Gone " , which was replaced with " You 'll See " on some select U.S. venues . Dancers started the Evita tango interlude of " Don 't Cry for Me Argentina " . A number of candles were lit along the side of the stage . Madonna appeared in a half @-@ dress and performed the Spanish version of " What it Feels Like For a Girl " titled " Lo Que Siente La Mujer " . She finished the segment with an acoustic version of " La Isla Bonita " accompanied by flamenco dancing . 
 Madonna appeared on stage , in a halter D & G T @-@ shirt that read " Mother " on the front and " F * cker " on the back and a fur coat , singing a mash @-@ up of Stardust 's " Music Sounds Better With You " and " Holiday " . She and her entourage finished the show with a ghetto @-@ themed " Music " , introduced by Ali G , as her music video images flashed onscreen behind her . The song was mashed up with Kraftwerk 's song " Trans @-@ Europe Express " . The phrase " The End " appeared on the backdrops , and signified the show was over . 
 Several changes were made to the final shows in Los Angeles after the September 11 attacks : Madonna wore an American flag kilt during the show 's opening segment as a display of patriotism , the closing of " Mer Girl " ( part II ) was altered to remove the staged shooting of a character ; Madonna instead put the gun down , hugged him and they left the stage together . The macabre cannibalism @-@ themed " Funny Song " was removed . Additionally , as a surprise for Madonna at the final concert date , her husband at the time , Guy Ritchie , appeared as the lost technician at the end of " Beautiful Stranger " , the Samurai during " Sky Fits Heaven " wore Los Angeles Lakers jerseys . Also , all of the dancers joined in for the final dance section of " Holiday " , which usually only featured Madonna and her two backing singers . During the New York City performance of " Secret " , she dedicated the song to its inhabitants . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 The tour received positive reviews and critical acclaim . Cory Moss from MTV wrote that " music might make the world go round , but costumes and theatrics make it more fun . Nobody knows this better than the Material Girl . " Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH commented that " you 'd struggle to find a better show than Drowned World and you 'd find it difficult to find a mainstream artist who can command near @-@ universal respect for anything like as long as this fine lady . One could almost judge the artist by what was left out [ ... ] she displayed that temptress quality which has beguiled us for nearly two decades and that , combined with her exquisite music , is why Madonna is so special . " Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote : " Though her Cowgirl image is easily her least significant incarnation to date , Drowned World proves that Madonna is still unmatched in her ability to lift cultural iconography into the mainstream . [ ... ] Those who thought Madonna hung up her handcuffs along with the notorious Sex book should look again closely . With its themes of chaos , dominance , and , ultimately , celebration , Madonna 's Drowned World explores her ever @-@ fervid intrigue with both imposed and pious restraint . " 
 Simon Price from The Independent said that the tour " is a triumph of hydraulics , bungee rope acrobatics and cutting @-@ edge choreography . " However , he felt that the setlist consisting of mainly current songs implied that Madonna was doing " a paranoid attempt to frame herself as part of the present and not the past ? The irony here is that , given the ever @-@ decreasing spirals of pop revivalism , in order to be truly contemporary , rather than eschewing her past , Madonna would need to be ripping herself off circa 1984 . " John McAlley from Entertainment Weekly commented that the music was " loud , energetic , well @-@ sung , and perhaps a little too often beside the point " and that " [ it ] struggle [ d ] to rise above its [ the show 's ] theatrics . " He added that one will be " awed by Madonna 's palpable life force and intelligence . [ ... ] There are plenty of reasons to bow at this artist 's feat . " Jon Pareles of The New York Times said that " through the concert , Madonna made a display of arrogance , tossing off profanities , striking tough postures and glaring more often than she smiled . She represents self @-@ love backed by plenty of gym time and a whole troupe of devoted flunkies , all laboring to delight an audience she only seems to disdain . Music makes the people come together , she sang in the finale – together , that is , if Madonna is clearly in charge . " Alexis Petridis of The Guardian felt that " with its perfect dance routines , special effects , devoted audience and hint of bullish arrogance , the Drowned World show befits the world 's most famous woman . "

 Tour dates were limited to cities in Europe and North America . This decision caused some resentment among fans in other parts of the world . Drowned World became the first ( and only ) Madonna tour to skip over Canada completely . For many weeks prior to the launch of the tour dates , Arthur Fogel from Live Nation himself attempted to book dates in Toronto at the Air Canada Centre between the Sunrise , Atlanta , and Detroit dates , though no free bookings were available . In the end no dates were scheduled in Toronto , to the disappointment of many Canadian fans . Ticket sales were swift in London on April 25 , as Madonna sold out her dates at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in record time – six shows in six hours . Madonna made history with the fastest @-@ selling show ever at Earl 's Court , as 97 @,@ 000 tickets were sold . 
 The first show sold out in just fifteen minutes , and the online ticket website took one million hits in the first ten minutes while thirty million attempts were made to phone Madonna hotlines . All dates of Madonna 's Drowned World Tour sold out within minutes of going on sale . After the tour was over , industry reports presented that it earned US $ 76 @.@ 8 million ( $ 102 @.@ 64 million in 2016 dollars ) in total , from forty @-@ seven summer sold @-@ out shows and eventually played in front of 730 @,@ 000 people throughout North America and Europe , averaging at $ 1 @.@ 6 million ( $ 2 @.@ 14 million in 2016 dollars ) per show . Drowned World Tour became the highest @-@ grossing concert tour of 2001 by a solo artist , as well as the fourth highest @-@ grossing among all , behind U2 , N Sync and the Backstreet Boys . Drowned World received the Major Tour of the Year and Most Creative Stage Production awards nominations at the 2001 Pollstar awards , but lost them to U2 .

 Mathew Adam Latos ( / <unk> / LAY @-@ <unk> ; born December 9 , 1987 ) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is in the Washington Nationals organization . He has played in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for the San Diego Padres from 2009 through 2011 , the Cincinnati Reds from 2012 through 2014 , and the Miami Marlins , Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2015 and Chicago White Sox in 2016 . 
 Born in Alexandria , Virginia , Latos ' family moved to Florida when he was young . He played baseball at Coconut Creek High School , where he became one of the best high school players in the state . Highly regarded for his talent before the 2006 MLB draft , he fell to the 11th round due to questions about his maturity . After pitching at Broward College for a season , the San Diego Padres signed him for a $ 1 @.@ 25 million bonus . He debuted for the Padres in 2009 , and established himself in their starting rotation . The Reds traded four players , including three prospects , to acquire Latos before the 2012 season . The Marlins traded for Latos before the 2015 season and then traded him to the Dodgers in July 2015 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Latos is the only child born to Lisa and Rich Latos . He is originally from Alexandria , Virginia . When Latos was 12 years old , his grandfather insisted that he play in a baseball tournament rather than stay at his bedside the day he died . 
 = = High school and college = = 
 Latos attended Coconut Creek High School in Coconut Creek , Florida , despite being recruited to attend high schools with more prestigious baseball programs . He was named the ace starting pitcher of the Coconut Creek baseball team 's as a freshman . That year , he pitched to a 3 – 4 win – loss record and a 3 @.@ 68 earned run average ( ERA ) , with 41 strikeouts and 26 walks in 39 2 ⁄ 3 innings pitched . His fastball reached 88 to 89 miles per hour ( 142 – 143 km / h ) . He improved his fastball command and velocity as a sophomore , reaching 93 miles per hour ( 150 km / h ) and his statistics improved to a 5 – 2 record , a 1 @.@ 23 ERA , 89 strikeouts , and 21 walks in 68 innings . 
 Heading into his junior year , Latos improved his training regimen and diet . He pitched to a 7 – 4 record with a 0 @.@ 76 ERA as a junior with 128 strikeouts and 17 walks in 83 innings . Eleven of his thirteen starts were complete games . Coconut Creek reached the regional quarterfinals , and Latos was named an Aflac All @-@ American and All @-@ Broward County by the South Florida Sun @-@ Sentinel and Miami Herald . By his senior year , Latos could throw his fastball as high as 98 miles per hour ( 158 km / h ) . He was an honorable mention by the Florida Sports Writers Association for the All @-@ State team . As a senior , Latos had a 7 – 3 record with 110 strikeouts and a 0 @.@ 64 ERA in 69 2 ⁄ 3 innings pitched . He appeared in the Broward County Athletics Association All @-@ Star Game , and was named South Florida Sun @-@ Sentinel 's player of the year . 
 Latos committed to attend the University of Oklahoma to play college baseball for the Oklahoma Sooners baseball team . However , many scouts expected Latos to be a first @-@ round pick in the 2006 Major League Baseball ( MLB ) Draft . <unk> ranked Latos the fifth best high school pitcher available in the 2006 Major League Baseball draft . The San Diego Padres selected Latos in the 11th round ( 333rd overall ) . He fell in the draft since his personality made him difficult to handle in high school , as he was considered immature , and often yelled at teammates who made errors and reacted poorly when the umpire made a call he disagreed with . 
 After the draft , Latos demanded a $ 3 million signing bonus from the Padres . When the Padres did not meet his demands , Latos enrolled at Broward College , a junior college , to pitch for their baseball team . As the Padres retained the right to sign Latos until the start of the 2007 MLB draft , the Padres sent scout Joe Bochy to observe every start Latos made . Latos had a 10 – 3 win – loss record and a 2 @.@ 03 ERA . Feeling that Latos was worth the gamble , the Padres paid Latos $ 1 @.@ 25 million a few days before he would have re @-@ entered the draft in 2007 .

 Latos started his professional career in minor league baseball with the Eugene Emeralds , the Padres ' Class A @-@ Short Season affiliate in the Northwest League , in 2007 . Pitching in 16 games for Eugene , Latos had a 1 – 4 record and a 3 @.@ 83 ERA . In 2008 , Latos started the season with the Fort Wayne Wizards of the Class A Midwest League , but missed playing time during the season due to abdominal and shoulder injuries . 
 The Padres invited Latos to spring training in 2009 , but he suffered a minor ankle sprain that limited his appearances . Latos started the 2009 season in Fort Wayne , and allowed only one run in four starts . He was then promoted to the San Antonio Missions of the Class AA Texas League . At San Antonio , Latos had a 5 – 1 win – loss record , and threw five perfect innings in his last start for San Antonio on July 9 . Between Fort Wayne and San Antonio , Latos had an 8 – 1 record , a 1 @.@ 38 ERA , 73 strikeouts , and a <unk> batting average against ( BAA ) . The Padres named Latos their Padres Minor League Pitcher of the Month for May . Latos was selected to play in the 2009 All @-@ Star Futures Game , and threw one scoreless inning . 
 = = = San Diego Padres = = = 
 The Padres promoted Latos to make his major league debut on July 19 , 2009 , against the Colorado Rockies . In his major league debut , Latos pitched four innings , allowing three hits and two runs while striking out four , while throwing 75 pitches . He recorded his first major league win on July 24 . Latos became the first pitcher in Padres history to win four of his first five career starts . Latos made ten starts for the Padres in 2009 , pitching to a 4 – 5 record and a 4 @.@ 68 ERA . Latos irritated his veteran teammates with his " know @-@ it @-@ all " and abrasive personality . 
 Latos changed his attitude by the 2010 season , and became willing to take advice from his teammates . On May 13 , 2010 , Latos threw a complete game shutout against the division foe San Francisco Giants . The only hit he allowed was an infield single . The Padres won the game 1 – 0 . After posting a 5 @.@ 47 ERA through May 1 , Latos lowered his ERA down to 2 @.@ 45 right before the All Star Break , also leading the league in BAA and WHIP ( .193 and 0 @.@ 97 respectively ) . On September 7 , 2010 , Latos set a major league record with a seven – inning , 10 – strikeout performance in a win against the Dodgers . The victory was Latos ' 15th consecutive start logging at least five innings and allowing two or fewer earned runs , which was at the time the longest streak in modern baseball history ( since 1900 ) according to the Elias Sports Bureau . The record would be broken by Félix Hernández , who recorded 17 such straight outings during the 2014 season . Previously the mark had been set by Greg Maddux ( 1993 – 94 ) and Mike Scott ( 1986 ) , who had such streaks lasting 14 starts . On the season , Latos pitched to a 14 – 10 win – loss record in 31 games started , with a 2 @.@ 92 ( ERA ) , 1 @.@ 08 walks plus hits per inning pitched ( WHIP ) , and 189 strikeouts in 184 2 ⁄ 3 innings pitched . He placed eighth in voting for the National League Cy Young Award . 
 However , Latos lost his last five starts of the 2010 season , culminating with a 3 – 0 loss to the San Francisco Giants on October 3 that , combined with an Atlanta Braves win , eliminated the Padres from playoff contention . The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune attributed his struggles at the end of the year to fatigue , as his 189 2 ⁄ 3 innings for the season were 66 2 ⁄ 3 more than he pitched in 2009 . 
 Latos started 2011 on the disabled list due to a spring training shoulder injury . He lost his first four starts of the season , extending his losing streak to nine consecutive starts dating back to 2010 . The streak tied the longest streak in Padres history , held by Andy Benes and Dennis Rasmussen . Latos had a no @-@ decision in his next start after the bullpen blew a save opportunity , preventing him from earning a win . He lost another decision for a 10 @-@ game losing streak that was one less than the club record held by Gary Ross . Latos won on May 15 against the Colorado Rockies to end his losing streak . He ended the 2011 season with a 9 – 14 record and a 3 @.@ 47 ERA . 
 = = = Cincinnati Reds = = = 
 After the 2011 season , the Cincinnati Reds were looking for another frontline starter to pair with Johnny Cueto in their starting rotation . On December 17 , 2011 , the Padres traded Latos to the Reds in exchange for prospects Yonder Alonso , <unk> <unk> , and Brad <unk> , along with veteran starting pitcher Edinson Vólquez . 
 In the last week of June 2012 , Latos pitched two complete games . He was named the National League Player of the Week for the week ending July 1 . Latos finished the 2012 season with a 14 – 4 win – loss record a 3 @.@ 48 ERA . The Reds reached the playoffs , and faced the San Francisco Giants in the 2012 National League Division Series ( NLDS ) . On October 11 , 2012 , Latos gave up a grand slam to Buster Posey in a 6 @-@ run top of the fifth inning in the elimination game of the NLDS . Latos took the loss in this game , as the Reds were eliminated . 
 The Reds signed Latos to a two @-@ year contract worth $ 11 @.@ 5 million for the 2013 and 2014 seasons . Latos had a 21 @-@ game streak without a loss , extending from August 2012 to June 2013 . He finished the 2013 season with a 14 – 7 win – loss record and a 3 @.@ 16 ERA in 210 2 ⁄ 3 innings pitched . Though he suffered an abdominal strain on June 30 , he continued to pitch without missing any starts . He revealed the injury after a poor outing against the Pittsburgh Pirates in September . The Reds reached the 2013 National League Wild Card Game , opposing Pittsburgh . Reds ' manager Dusty Baker wanted to start Latos for that game , but a bone spur in his elbow prevented him from being available . Baker chose Cueto as his starter . The Reds lost the game , ending their season . 
 Latos had surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow during the offseason . During spring training in 2014 , Latos tore cartilage in his left knee , which was repaired with surgery . His knee had not fully recovered in time for Opening Day of the 2014 season , which he started on the disabled list . He began a rehabilitation assignment with the Louisville Bats of the Class AAA International League on May 26 , and made his 2014 season debut with the Reds on June 14 . Latos said that he came back at " 80 – 90 percent " effectiveness due to his desire to help his team , but experienced setbacks with his knee during the season . He averaged 90 @.@ 7 miles per hour ( 146 @.@ 0 km / h ) on his fastball , down from 92 @.@ 5 miles per hour ( 148 @.@ 9 km / h ) during the 2013 season . His last start came on September 7 , as he suffered a bone bruise on the elbow of his pitching arm . His 2014 season ended with a 5 – 5 record and a 3 @.@ 25 ERA in 16 starts .

 With the goal of reducing their payroll , and with Latos eligible for free agency after the 2015 season , the Reds traded Latos to the Miami Marlins in exchange for Anthony <unk> and Chad Wallach during the 2014 Winter Meetings . Latos sought a $ 10 @.@ 4 million salary for the 2015 season in salary arbitration , but the arbiters sided with the Marlins , who proposed a salary of $ 9 @.@ 4 million . 
 Latos had 90 cubic centimeters of fluid drained from his left knee during spring training . He allowed seven runs in 2 ⁄ 3 of an inning in his first start for Miami , and struggled through knee pain through May .

It was devised in 1933 in order to provide irrigation and municipal water to much of California 's Central Valley — by regulating and storing water in reservoirs in the water @-@ rich northern half of the state , and transporting it to the water @-@ poor San Joaquin Valley and its surroundings by means of a series of canals , aqueducts and pump plants , some shared with the California State Water Project ( SWP ) . Many CVP water users are represented by the Central Valley Project Water Association . 
 In addition to water storage and regulation , the system has a hydroelectric capacity of over 2 @,@ 000 megawatts , provides recreation , and provides flood control with its twenty dams and reservoirs . It has allowed major cities to grow along Valley rivers which previously would flood each spring , and transformed the semi @-@ arid desert environment of the San Joaquin Valley into productive farmland . Freshwater stored in Sacramento River reservoirs and released downriver during dry periods prevents salt water from intruding into the Sacramento @-@ San Joaquin Delta during high tide . There are eight divisions of the project and ten corresponding units , many of which operate in conjunction , while others are independent of the rest of the network . California agriculture and related industries now directly account for 7 % of the gross state product for which the CVP supplied water for about half . 
 Despite the benefits of the Project , many CVP operations have resulted in disastrous environmental and historical consequences . The salmon population in four major California rivers have declined as a result , and many natural river environments , such as riparian zones , meanders and sandbars no longer exist . Many archaeological and historic sites , as well as Native American tribal lands , now lie submerged under reservoirs for the CVP , which has received heavy criticism for promoting high @-@ water @-@ demand irrigated industrial farming that in turn has polluted rivers and groundwater . USBR has also been known to stretch the boundaries of many state and federal regulations in its operations of the CVP . The Central Valley Project Improvement Act , passed in 1992 , intends to alleviate some of the problems associated with the CVP with programs like the Refuge Water Supply Program . 
 In recent years , a combination of drought and regulatory decisions passed based on the Endangered Species Act of 1973 have forced Reclamation to turn off much of the water for the west side of the San Joaquin Valley in order to protect the fragile ecosystem in the Sacramento @-@ San Joaquin Delta and keep alive the dwindling fish populations of Central Valley rivers .

 The CVP stores about 13 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 16 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 dam3 ) of water in 20 reservoirs in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada , the Klamath Mountains and the California Coast Ranges , and passes about 7 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 9 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 dam3 ) of water annually through its canals . Of the water transported , about 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 6 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 dam3 ) goes to about 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 ha ) of irrigated agricultural fields , 600 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 740 @,@ 000 dam3 ) supplies municipal uses , and 800 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 990 @,@ 000 dam3 ) is released into rivers and wetlands in order to comply with state and federal ecological standards . 
 Two large reservoirs , Shasta Lake and Trinity Lake , are formed by a pair of dams in the mountains north of the Sacramento Valley . Water from both of these lakes are released into the Sacramento River , which flows to the Sacramento @-@ San Joaquin Delta , at controlled rates . There , before it can flow on to San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean , some of the water is intercepted by a diversion channel and transported to the Delta @-@ Mendota Canal , which conveys water southwards through the San Joaquin Valley , supplying water to San Luis Reservoir ( a SWP @-@ shared facility ) and the San Joaquin River at Mendota Pool in the process , eventually reaching canals that irrigates farms in the valley . Friant Dam crosses the San Joaquin River upstream of Mendota Pool , diverting its water southwards into canals that travel into the Tulare Lake area of the San Joaquin Valley , as far south as the Kern River . Finally , New Melones Lake , a separate facility , stores water flow of a San Joaquin River tributary for use during dry periods . Other smaller , independent facilities exist to provide water to local irrigation districts . 
 = = = History = = = 
 Despite the rich soils and favorable weather of the 42 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 110 @,@ 000 km2 ) Central Valley , inhabitants of the valley who were unfamiliar with its natural rainfall patterns and started to practice intense irrigated agriculture on the arid land soon found themselves troubled by frequent floods in the Sacramento Valley and a general lack of water in the San Joaquin Valley . The Sacramento River , which drains the northern part , receives between 60 @-@ 75 % of the precipitation in the Valley , despite the Sacramento Valley covering less area than the much larger San Joaquin Valley , drained by the San Joaquin River , which receives only about 25 % of the rainfall . Furthermore , cities drawing water from the Sacramento @-@ San Joaquin Delta faced problems in dry summer and autumn months when the inflowing water was low . In order to continue to sustain the valley 's economy , there needed to be systems to regulate flows in the rivers and equally distribute water among the north and south parts of the valley . 
 In 1873 , Barton S. Alexander completed a report for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that was the first attempt at creating a Central Valley Project . In 1904 , the Bureau of Reclamation ( then the Reclamation Service ) first became interested in creating such a water project , but did not get far involved until a series of droughts and related disasters occurred in the early 1920s . The State of California passed the Central Valley Project Act in 1933 , which authorized Reclamation to sell revenue bonds in order to raise about $ 170 million for the project . Unfortunately , because of insufficient money in the state 's treasury and the coincidence with the Great Depression , California turned to the national government for funding to build the project . This resulted in several transfers of the project between California and the federal government , and between Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers . The first dams and canals of the project started going up in the late 1930s , and the last facilities were completed in the early 1970s . Other features of the project were never constructed , some lie partly finished , or are still awaiting authorization .

 Shasta Division consists of a pair of large dams on the Sacramento River north of the city of Redding . The Shasta Dam is the primary water storage and power generating facility of the CVP . It impounds the Sacramento River to form Shasta Lake , which can store over 4 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 5 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 dam3 ) of water , and can generate 680 MW of power . Shasta Dam functions to regulate the flow of the Sacramento River so that downstream diversion dams and canals can capture the flow of the river more efficiently , and to prevent flooding in the Sacramento @-@ San Joaquin Delta where many water pump facilities for San Joaquin Valley aqueducts are located . The Keswick Dam functions as an afterbay ( regulating reservoir ) for the Shasta Dam , also generating power . 
 The Sacramento Canals Division of the CVP takes water from the Sacramento River much farther downstream of the Shasta and Keswick Dams . Diversion dams , pumping plants , and aqueducts provide municipal water supply as well as irrigation of about 98 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 <unk> ) . The Red Bluff Diversion Dam diverts part of the Sacramento River into the 110 @-@ mile ( 180 km ) Tehama @-@ Colusa Canal , the 21 @-@ mile ( 34 km ) Corning Canal and a small reservoir formed by <unk> Dam . Five pump plants take water from the canal and feed it to the Colusa County water distribution grid . 
 = = = Trinity River = = = 
 Trinity River Division is the second large CVP department for the northern Sacramento Valley . The primary purpose of the division is to divert water from the Trinity River into the Sacramento River drainage downstream of Shasta Dam in order to provide more flow in the Sacramento River and generating peaking power in the process . Trinity Dam forms Trinity Lake , the second largest CVP water @-@ storage reservoir , with just over half the capacity of Shasta and a generating capacity of 140 MW . Lewiston Dam , downstream of Trinity Dam , diverts water into the Clear Creek Tunnel , which travels to empty into a third reservoir , Whiskeytown Lake on Clear Creek , a tributary of the Sacramento River , generating 154 MW of power in the process . Whiskeytown Lake ( formed by Clair . A Hill Whiskeytown Dam ) in turn provides water to the Spring Creek Tunnel , which travels into the lowermost extreme of Spring Creek , a stream that flows into Keswick Reservoir , generating another 180 MW of electricity . From there the water from the Trinity River empties into Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River . In 1963 , the Spring Creek Debris Dam was constructed just upstream of the outlet of the Spring Creek Tunnel , to prevent acid mine drainage from the Iron Mountain Mine from continuing downstream and contaminating the river . 
 = = = American River = = = 
 The American River Division is located in north @-@ central California , on the east side of the Great Central Valley . Its structures use the water of the American River , which drains off the Sierra Nevada and flows into the Sacramento River . The division is further divided into three units : the Folsom , Sly Park and Auburn @-@ Folsom South . The American River Division stores water in the American River watershed , to both provide water supply for local settlements , and supply it to the rest of the system . The dams also are an important flood control measure . Hydroelectricity is generated at Folsom and Nimbus dams , and marketed to the Western Area Power Administration . 
 The Folsom Unit consists of Folsom Dam , its primary water storage component , and Nimbus Dam , which serves as its downstream forebay . The Folsom Dam is located on the American River , and stores 1 @,@ 010 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 1 @,@ 250 @,@ 000 dam3 ) of water in its reservoir , Folsom Lake . Folsom Lake covers 11 @,@ 550 acres ( 4 @,@ 670 ha ) and is located inside the Folsom Lake State Recreational Area . Eight additional earthfill saddle dams are required to keep the reservoir from overflowing . The dam also generates 200 MW from three generators . About 7 mi ( 11 km ) downstream of Folsom Dam is the Nimbus Dam , forming Lake <unk> . The dam generates 7 @.@ 7 MW from two Kaplan turbines on the north side of the river . The Nimbus Fish Hatchery is located downstream of Nimbus Dam , to compensate for the two dams ' destruction of American River spawning grounds . 
 The Sly Park Unit includes Sly Park Dam , Jenkinson Lake , the Camp Creek Diversion Dam , and two diversion tunnels . The Sly Park Dam and its <unk> @-@ sized auxiliary dam form Jenkinson Lake , which covers 650 acres ( 260 ha ) . Jenkinson Lake feeds the Camino Conduit , a 5 mi ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) aqueduct . The Camp Creek Diversion Dam diverts some water from Camp Creek into Jenkinson Lake . 
 The third unit is the Auburn @-@ Folsom South Unit , consisting of several dams on American River tributaries . These include Sugar Pine Dam and Pipeline ( supplying water to Foresthill ) , and the uncompleted Folsom South Canal . The primary component of the unit , concrete thin @-@ arch Auburn Dam , was to be located on the North Fork of the American , but was never built because of the significant risk of earthquakes in the area , and general public opposition to the project . However , the high Foresthill Bridge , built as part of the preliminary work for Auburn Dam , still stands . County Line Dam , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of Folsom Dam , was also never built .

 One of the most important parts of the CVP 's San Joaquin Valley water system is the series of aqueducts and pumping plants that take water from the Sacramento @-@ San Joaquin Delta and send it southwards to supply farms and cities . The Delta Cross Channel intercepts Sacramento River water as it travels westwards towards Suisun Bay and diverts it south through a series of man @-@ made channels , the Mokelumne River , and other natural sloughs , marshes and distributaries . From there , the water travels to the C.W. Bill Jones Pumping Plant , which raises water into the Delta @-@ Mendota Canal , which in turn travels 117 miles ( 188 km ) southwards to Mendota Pool on the San Joaquin River , supplying water to other CVP reservoirs about midway . A facility exists at the entrance of the pump plant in order to catch fish that would otherwise end up in the Delta @-@ Mendota Canal . A second canal , the Contra Costa Canal , captures freshwater near the central part of the delta , taking it 48 miles ( 77 km ) southwards , distributing water to the Clayton and Ygnacio Canals in the process , and supplying water to Contra Loma Dam , eventually terminating at Martinez Reservoir . 
 = = = San Joaquin River = = = 
 The CVP also has several dams on the San Joaquin River — which has far less average flow than the Sacramento — in order to divert its water to southern Central Valley aqueducts . The Friant Dam , completed in 1942 , is the largest component of the Friant Division of the CVP . The dam crosses the San Joaquin River where it spills out of the Sierra Nevada , forming Millerton Lake , which provides water storage for San Joaquin Valley irrigators as well as providing a diversion point for a pair of canals , the Friant @-@ Kern Canal and the Madera Canal . The Friant @-@ Kern Canal sends water southwards through the Tulare Lake area to its terminus at Bakersfield on the Kern River , supplying irrigation water to Tulare , Fresno , and Kern counties . The Madera Canal takes water northwards to Madera County , emptying into the Chowchilla River . 
 = = = Stanislaus River = = = 
 On the Stanislaus River , a major tributary of the San Joaquin , lies the relatively independent East Side Division and New Melones Unit of the CVP . The sole component of the division / unit is New Melones Dam , forming New Melones Lake , which , when filled to capacity , holds nearly 2 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 dam3 ) of water , about equal to the storage capacity of Trinity Lake . The dam functions to store water during dry periods and release it downstream into the northern San Joaquin Valley according to water demand . The dam generates 279 MW of power with a peaking capacity of 300 MW . 
 = = = <unk> storage and aqueducts = = = 
 The CVP has a significant amount of facilities for storing and transporting water on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley , in the foothills of the California Coast Ranges . The West San Joaquin Division and San Luis Unit consist of several major facilities that are shared with the federal California State Water Project ( SWP ) . San Luis Dam ( or B.F. Sisk Dam ) is the largest storage facility , holding 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 2 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 dam3 ) of water . Although called an offstream storage reservoir by <unk> , the reservoir floods part of the San Luis Creek valley . San Luis Creek , however , is not the primary water source for the reservoir . Downstream of San Luis Reservoir is O 'Neill Forebay , which is intersected by the Delta @-@ Mendota Canal , a separate CVP facility . Water is pumped from the canal into the Forebay and uphill into San Luis Reservoir , which functions as an additional water source during dry periods . 
 Water released from San Luis and O 'Neill reservoirs feeds into the San Luis Canal , the federally built section of the California Aqueduct , which carries both CVP and SWP water . The San Luis Canal terminates at <unk> City , where it connects with the state @-@ built section of the California Aqueduct . With a capacity of 13 @,@ 100 cubic feet per second ( 370 m3 / s ) , it is one of the largest irrigation canals in the United States . The Coalinga or Pleasant Valley Canal branches off the San Luis Canal towards the Coalinga area . A pair of separate dams , Los Baños <unk> Dam and Little <unk> Detention Dam , provide flood control in the Los Baños area . The San Luis Drain was a separate project by <unk> in an attempt to keep contaminated irrigation drainage water out of the San Joaquin River , emptying into <unk> Reservoir where the water would evaporate or seep into the ground . Because of environmental concerns , the system was never completed . 
 The CVP also operates a San Felipe Division to supply water to 63 @,@ 500 acres ( 25 @,@ 700 ha ) of land in the Santa Clara Valley west of the Coast Ranges . San Justo Dam stores water diverted from San Luis Reservoir through the Pacheco Tunnel and Hollister Conduit , which travel through the Diablo Range . A separate canal , the Santa Clara Tunnel and Conduit , carries water to the Santa Clara Valley .

 Once , profuse runs of anadromous fish — salmon , steelhead , and others — migrated up the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers to spawn in great numbers . The construction of CVP dams on the two rivers and many of their major tributaries — namely Friant Dam and Shasta Dam — mostly ended the once @-@ bountiful Central Valley salmon run . From north to south , the Sacramento upriver of Shasta Dam , the American upriver of Folsom Dam , the Stanislaus upriver of New Melones Dam , and the San Joaquin upriver of Mendota — have become inaccessible to migrating salmon . In three of these cases , it is because the dams are too high and their reservoirs too large for fish to bypass via fish ladders . The San Joaquin River , however , had a different fate . Almost 60 mi ( 97 km ) of the river is dry because of diversions from Friant Dam and Millerton Lake . Even downstream of Mendota , where the Delta @-@ Mendota Canal gives the river a new surge of water from the Sacramento @-@ San Joaquin Delta , irrigation runoff water , contaminated with pesticides and fertilizer , has caused the river to become heavily polluted . To make matters worse , efforts by the California Department of Fish and Game to route the San Joaquin salmon run into the Merced River in the 1950s failed , because the salmon did not realize the Merced as their " home stream " . 
 Not only on the San Joaquin River have CVP facilities wreaked environmental havoc . On the Sacramento River , Red Bluff Diversion Dam in Tehama County , while not as large or as impacting as Friant Dam , was once a barrier to the migration of anadromous fish . The original fish passage facilities of the dam continually experienced problems from the beginning of operation in 1966 , and introduced species that prey on young smolt often gather at the base of the dam , which reduced the population of <unk> juvenile salmon into the Pacific . The Red Bluff Diversion Dam has since been replaced with a fish screen and pumping plant , thus allowing unimpaired passage through Red Bluff . Further upstream , Keswick and Shasta Dams form total barriers to fish migration . Even out of the Central Valley watershed , the CVP 's diversion of water from the Trinity River from Lewiston Dam into Whiskeytown Lake has significantly hurt the Klamath River tributary 's salmon run . Over three @-@ quarters of the river 's flow is diverted through the Clear Creek Tunnel and away from the Trinity River , causing the river below the dam to become warm , silty , shallow and slow @-@ flowing , attributes that hurt young salmon . Furthermore , the Trinity Dam forms a blockade that prevents salmon from reaching about 109 miles ( 175 km ) of upriver spawning grounds . In the early years of the 21st century , the Bureau of Reclamation finally began to steadily increase the water flow downstream from Lewiston Dam . While providing less water for the CVP altogether , the new flow regime allows operations to meet the line drawn by Reclamation itself in 1952 stating that at least 48 % of the river 's natural flow must be left untouched in order for Trinity River salmon to survive . The lack of flow in the Trinity up to then was also a violation of the authorization that Congress made over the operation of the dam . The " ... legislation required that enough be left in the Trinity for in @-@ basin needs , including preservation of the salmon fishery . " 
 In the early years of the 21st century , the Bureau of Reclamation studied the feasibility of raising Shasta Dam . One of the proposed heights was 18 @.@ 5 feet ( 5 @.@ 6 m ) greater than its current size , thus increasing the storage capacity of Shasta Lake by 636 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 784 @,@ 000 dam3 ) . The agency also proposed a smaller raise of 6 @.@ 5 ft ( 2 @.@ 0 m ) that would add 290 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 360 @,@ 000 dam3 ) . Previously , a 200 ft ( 61 m ) raise of the dam , increasing storage to 13 @,@ 890 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 17 @,@ 130 @,@ 000 dam3 ) , was considered , but deemed uneconomical . When Shasta Dam was first built , it was actually planned to be two hundred feet higher than it is now , but Reclamation stopped construction at its present height because of a shortage of materials and workers during World War II . The raising of the dam would further regulate and store more Sacramento River water for dry periods , thus benefiting the entire operations of the CVP , and also generating additional power . However , the proposed height increase was fought over for many reasons . Raising the dam would cost several hundred million dollars and raise the price of irrigation water from Shasta Lake . It would drown most of the remaining land belonging to the <unk> Wintu tribe — 90 percent of whose land already lies beneath the surface of the lake — and flood several miles of the McCloud River , protected under National Wild and Scenic River status . Buildings , bridges , roads and other structures would have to be relocated . The added capacity of the reservoir would change flow fluctuations in the lower Sacramento River , and native fish populations , especially salmon , would suffer with the subsequent changes to the ecology of the river . 
 New Melones Dam has come under even greater controversy than Shasta Dam , mainly because of the project 's conflicts with federal and state limits and its impact on the watershed of the Stanislaus River . The original Melones Dam , submerged underneath New Melones Lake ( hence the name New Melones Dam ) is the source of one of these problems . The disused Melones Dam blocks cold water at the bottom of the lake from reaching the river , especially in dry years when the surface of the lake is closer to the crest of the old dam . This results in the river below the dam attaining a much higher temperature than usual , hurting native fish and wildlife . To solve this problem , Reclamation shuts off operations of the dam 's hydroelectric power plant when water levels are drastically low , but this results in power shortages . Originally , after the dam was constructed , the State of California put filling the reservoir on hold because of enormous public opposition to what was being inundated : the limestone canyon behind the dam , the deepest of its kind in the United States , contained hundreds of archaeological and historic sites and one of California 's best and most popular whitewater rafting runs . Thus the reservoir extended only to Parrot 's Ferry Bridge , 9 mi ( 14 km ) below its maximum upriver limit , until the El Niño event of 1982 @-@ 1983 , which filled it to capacity within weeks and even forced Reclamation to open the emergency spillways , prompting the state and federal governments to repeal the limits they had imposed on the reservoir . Furthermore , the project allows a far smaller sustainable water yield than originally expected , and Reclamation calls the dam " a case study of all that can go wrong with a project " . 
 In response to these environmental problems , Congress passed in 1992 the Central Valley Project Improvement Act ( <unk> ) , Title 34 of Public Law 102 @-@ 575 , to change water management practices in the CVP in order to lessen the ecological impact on the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers . Actions mandated included the release of more water to supply rivers and wetlands , funding for habitat restoration work ( especially for anadromous fish spawning gravels ) , water temperature control , water conservation , fish passage , increasing the service area of the CVP 's canals , and other items .

 = Camus Cross = 
 The Camus Cross , otherwise known as the Camuston or Camustane Cross , is an Early Medieval Scottish standing stone located on the Panmure Estate near Carnoustie in Angus , Scotland . First recorded in the 15th century in a legal document describing the boundaries between Camuston and the barony of Downie , and described in the 17th century by Robert Maule , it is a freestanding cross , rare in Eastern Scotland . 
 The cross is thought to date from the tenth century , and exhibits distinctive Hiberno @-@ Scottish mission influences , in common with several other monuments in the area . Tradition and folk etymology suggest that the cross marked the burial site of Camus , leader of the Norse army purportedly defeated by King Malcolm II at the apocryphal Battle of Barry . The name of the stone is likely to derive from the extinct village of Camuston , which has a Celtic toponymy . 
 = = Location = = 
 The Camus Cross is in the Downie Hills , approximately 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) northwest of Carnoustie in Angus , Scotland . It is situated at the centre of a 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) long avenue leading east @-@ north @-@ east through Camuston Wood from the Panmure Testimonial to the Craigton to Carnoustie road , at ( grid reference <unk> ) . The avenue is part of Panmure Estate and leads , beyond the road , to the former site of Panmure House . 
 = = Description = = 
 The freestanding cross is carved from Old Red Sandstone and stands 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) high , approximately 0 @.@ 6 metres ( 2 @.@ 0 ft ) wide at the base , 0 @.@ 8 metres ( 2 @.@ 6 ft ) wide at the arms , and approximately 0 @.@ 2 metres ( 0 @.@ 66 ft ) thick . It stands on a low earth mound , 7 @.@ 5 metres ( 25 ft ) wide ( east to west ) , 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) wide ( north to south ) and 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) high , in the centre of the Camuston Wood avenue , facing east to west . All faces and sides are sculpted . The cross has suffered significant weathering , most notably on the west face , which has obscured some of the designs . 
 The stone bears no idiomatic Pictish symbols and , under J Romilly Allen and Joseph Anderson 's classification system , it is a class III stone . Intact freestanding crosses of this age are comparatively rare , perhaps due to their vulnerability to damage , and the only ones in Eastern Scotland are the Camus Cross and the Dupplin Cross in Strathearn . Fragmentary remains of other crosses include heads found at Forteviot , St Vigeans and <unk> and shaft fragments found at Monifieth , Abernethy , Carpow and Invermay , as well as some socketed stones where crosses once stood . 
 The western face is divided into three sections . The uppermost section is almost completely weathered . The antiquarian Alexander Gordon , who described the stone in 1726 in his Itinerarium <unk> , records this panel as holding a crucifixion scene , with the figure of a man at the right hand side and the left side completely defaced . Below this is a depiction of a centaur holding a bow , with the lowest panel having a symmetrical floral scroll design . 
 The eastern face is usually interpreted as a depiction of Christ flanked by angels above the four evangelists , although Robert Maule , in the earliest description of the stone , described the scene as Moses giving out the Law . 
 The carving on the Camus Cross shows distinct similarities with those on the Brechin Hogback stone and point to an Irish Ecclesiastical influence . The foliar designs on the north and south edges , originally seen as Ringerike @-@ like ( and hence , Scandinavian in origin ) , consist of tendrils and volutes with " wave @-@ crest " thickening . These features bear closest similarity with Irish insular art of the late tenth century , and the treatment of the symmetrical foliar scroll design on the lower portion of the west face is <unk> Irish . The full @-@ face figures on the east face are of an identical type to those on the Brechin Hogback . In the case of the Brechin Hogback , the figures are carrying objects that are characteristic of early medieval Irish monasticism . 
 = = History = = 
 The Camus Cross is currently thought to be a late Pictish / early Gaelic era monument , dating from the 10th century . The earliest record of it is in a legal document of 1481 , describing the boundary of the lands of Camuston , owned by Sir Thomas Maule , and the barony of Downy , owned by the Earl of Crawford . The boundary was described as running " a magna cruce <unk> de <unk> " ( ' from the great stone cross of Camuston ' ) . It was mentioned in the context of the Battle of Barry in Hector Boece 's Historia Gentis Scotorum in 1527 , and first described in detail by the antiquarian Robert Maule , who erected it at its present position in 1620 , after moving it six feet to centralise it within the Camuston Wood avenue .

 Camus was the supposed leader of a Norse expeditionary force defeated by the armies of King Malcolm II at the Battle of Barry . Tradition , popularised in the sixteenth century by historian Hector Boece , states that Camus fled the battle scene when defeat was imminent , and was caught and slain at the point where the cross now stands . The battle , and its main protagonists , including Camus , are now known to be historically inauthentic . 
 The name of the cross is likely to derive from the village of Camuston . No trace of this village can be seen today , and it had ceased to exist by the time of the first Ordnance Survey map , published in 1888 , but surveyed in 1857 to 1859 . Its former location is indicated in the 1794 map by Ainslie , about half a mile to the east of the cross . Camuston can be found with earlier spelling variations , for example , ' <unk> ' as it is called in documents from 1425 and 1426 , and has a Celtic rather than Scandinavian etymology . 
 A burial disinterred in 1598 , near the Camus cross , was attributed by Maule as being the body of Camus : 
 Not far <unk> in the bank of <unk> , the <unk> of God Im <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , thear <unk> ane <unk> <unk> <unk> ane bread stone on <unk> quarter <unk> efter the forme of ane malt <unk> , <unk> did ly the <unk> bons of ane man of <unk> <unk> , the thee bone quharof <unk> neir als longue as <unk> the <unk> and thee bone of any reasonable man of this age , the <unk> pan <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> bread of ane hand <unk> , quhilk had <unk> the <unk> as <unk> of ane sword , it wes thought to <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief mans <unk> . 
 Little information of the burial exists , but goods found in the cist were kept at Brechin Castle . These were sketched by <unk> and are typical of Bronze Age artifacts , found fairly commonly in the area .

 The Up All Night Tour was the first headlining concert tour by English @-@ Irish boy band One Direction , showcasing their debut album , Up All Night ( 2011 ) . It began in December 2011 and was One Direction 's first solo tour after being formed in the seventh series of The X Factor and being signed to Syco Records . The concert tour was announced in September 2011 by concert producer Nik <unk> <unk> , with the initial British and Irish dates being revealed . The concert tour was managed by Modest ! Management , the shows were backed by a five @-@ piece musical band , and the creative assessments were handled by Caroline Watson and Lou Teasdale , among others . After the initial concert tour concluded in January 2012 , shortly afterwards , the concert tour expanded with legs in Oceania and North America . They ultimately played over 60 shows in Europe , Oceania and North America . 
 The setlist encompassed songs from One Direction 's debut album and five covers . Commentators commended One Direction 's singing abilities and stage presence , and the production of the show . The Up All Night Tour was a commercial success , with additional matinée and evening shows being performed at several venues . A recording of the Up All Night Tour was filmed during One Direction 's January 2012 show at the International Centre in Bournemouth . Documenting the whole concert with intersperses of backstage footage , a video album , Up All Night : The Live Tour , was released on DVD in May 2012 . The video concert DVD was a global success , topping the charts in twenty @-@ five countries and setting an unprecedented US chart record . By August 2012 , the video album had sold in excess of one million copies worldwide .

 After being formed and finishing third in the seventh series of The X Factor in 2010 , One Direction were signed to Syco Music . The group and nine other contestants from the series participated in The X Factor Live Tour 2011 from February 2011 to April 2011 . The tour saw the group performing for 500 @,@ 000 people throughout the UK . While touring on The X Factor Live Tour 2011 in April 2011 , the group disclosed that they would be embarking on a solo tour " soon " . 
 One Direction 's debut headline UK concert tour , the Up All Night Tour , was officially announced on 27 September 2011 . Set for December 2011 and January 2012 , the tour would showcase their then @-@ upcoming debut album , and would commence on 18 December 2011 in Watford , England and end 26 January 2012 in Belfast , Northern Ireland . One Direction announced the solo tour shortly after releasing their first single , " What Makes You Beautiful " . Shows in the UK and Ireland were an instant success — many rumoured to have sold out in under 10 seconds . Additional shows were added , including an expansion into Australia and New Zealand . In February 2012 , One Direction announced the Oceania leg , the tour dates set for April 2012 , scheduled to visit cities Sydney , Brisbane , Melbourne , Auckland and Wellington . While promoting the tour , band member Liam Payne stated the group wanted this trek to be a " world tour " . To kick off the tour , the band performed a rehearsal show in Watford . Once the first leg of the tour was complete , the band joined Big Time Rush as the opening act on the Better With U Tour . 
 During a break from concerts , One Direction promoted their album in the United States . Following an appearance on The Today Show , Up All Night was released in the US and One Direction became the first ever UK group to have their debut album bow atop the Billboard 200 . This led to the group extending the tour into North America . On 21 March 2012 , One Direction announced the North American leg of the tour . The North American leg would start on 24 May 2012 and compromise out of 26 shows . Shortly after the announcement British recording artist Olly Murs was confirmed to be the opening act for select dates on tour .

 The concerts in England and Ireland received mixed feedback from critics . Kitty Empire ( The Observer ) was not impressed with the show at Windsor Hall . Empire wrote , " It 's easy to sneer at boy bands , but always worth considering their appeal . It goes without saying that One Direction are slick , and often bland . With the exception of their persuasive No 1 single , " What Makes You Beautiful " , their songs aren 't wildly distinctive " . For the concert at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo in London , James Robertson ( Daily Mirror ) gave the band a positive review . He states , " The room shook with hair raising , ear drum piercing and ( if there had been windows ) glass @-@ shattering screams . Each took a turn walking forward to embrace the cries from the sold @-@ out Hammersmith Apollo while singing the lame @-@ named Na , Na , Na . It was impossible to tell which one of the five boys had the biggest ovation but the loudest cheer came when Niall played acoustic guitar as they sang solo around an artificial camp fire " . Another glowing review was done by Alexandra Ryan ( Evening Herald ) for the concert at Dublin 's The O2 . She says , " <unk> came , they saw , they conquered . Dreams came true for thousands of Irish female fans as their pop idols One Direction took to the stage at the O2 . Swarms of screaming girls flocked to the sold @-@ out venue last night as Zayn , Harry , Louis , Liam and Mullingar teen Niall Horan performed for 14 @,@ 000 fans " . 
 As the tour progressed to Oceania and North America , many commentators remarked on the band 's popularity and their singing abilities . For the concert at Sydney 's Hordern Pavilion , Mike Wass ( Idolator ) felt One Direction 's " surprisingly accomplished effort " of Kings of Leon 's " Use Somebody " proved that One Direction are " more than capable " of evolving their sound . Cameron Adams ( Herald Sun ) wrote a positive review for the concert in Melbourne at the Hisense Arena . He assessed that One Direction represented a " cleverly cast pop band with plenty of personality unleashed at the perfect time and seizing their moment . " He opined that the covers performed showcased " strong pop voices . " Adams concluded as follows : " Who knows if they 'll progress beyond the usual boy band lifespan . But for now they 're making a lot of people very happy . " Reviewing the concert in Fairfax at the Patriot Center , Chris Richards ( The Washington Post ) elaborated on the concert synopsis . He wrote , " Over the course of umpteen songs , its members didn 't work the stage so much as loiter on it . They looked comfortable . No silly choreography , just a few ensemble fist @-@ pumps . No ridiculous costumes , just letterman jackets , cardigans and <unk> . A no @-@ nonsense backing band — guitar , bass , keyboards and drums — provided steady renditions of nearly all of the songs on the group 's debut album , " Up All Night " , as well as a few covers , including Kings of Leon 's " Use Somebody " and Natalie Imbruglia 's " Torn . " 
 Lars Brandle ( Billboard ) reviewed the concert at the <unk> Great Hall in Brisbane . Brandle predominantly noted the band 's popularity : " To say [ 1D ] is the hottest boy @-@ band on the scene , doesn 't quite grasp the situation . " On fire " is closer to the mark . " Brandle commended the show for being " all slick , clean fun " . Erica Futterman ( Rolling Stone ) wrote in a title for the concert at the Beacon Theatre in New York , " U.K. boy band relies on vocal prowess and charisma to keep fan base loyal . " Futterman highlighted their acoustic performances , which " showed off Horan 's ability to play guitar , as well as One Direction 's admirable live vocals " <unk> concluded that there " was no need to worry about a backing track or a bum note , a pleasant realization at a pop show " . Jane Stevenson ( Canoe.ca ) maintained that the show at the Molson Canadian Amphitheatre in Toronto had " none of that choreographed dance move nonsense " , and complimented the " naturally , classy , low @-@ key " production . Melody Lau ( National Post ) reviewed the same concert . Lau opined , " It 's easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost @-@ too @-@ put @-@ together preppy style but somewhere in the midst of all the love @-@ struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and , to a certain extent , entertain . " Lau additionally noted One Direction 's lack of original material to perform , " the group falls back on a handful of covers to fill in their set , including Kings of Leon 's " Use Somebody " , Gym Class Heroes ' " Stereo Hearts " and , surprisingly , Natalie Imbruglia 's " Torn " . Not straying too far away from the originals , the mid @-@ show medley definitely felt like the boys randomly belting out songs for the sake of filler but girls didn 't mind . "

 Robert James " Bobby " Fischer ( March 9 , 1943 – January 17 , 2008 ) was an American chess grandmaster , the eleventh World Chess Champion . Many consider him the greatest chess player of all time . In 1972 , he captured the World Chess Championship from Boris Spassky of the USSR in a match held in Reykjavík , Iceland , publicized as a Cold War confrontation which attracted more worldwide interest than any chess championship before or since . In 1975 , Fischer refused to defend his title when an agreement could not be reached with FIDE , the game 's international governing body , over one of the conditions for the match . This allowed Soviet GM Anatoly Karpov , who had won the qualifying Candidates ' cycle , to become the new world champion by default under FIDE rules . 
 Fischer showed skill at an early age . At age 13 he won a " brilliancy " that became known as " The Game of the Century " . Starting at age 14 , Fischer played in eight United States Championships , winning each by at least a one @-@ point margin . At age 15 , Fischer became both the youngest grandmaster up to that time and the youngest candidate for the World Championship . 
 At age 20 , Fischer won the 1963 – 64 U.S. Championship with 11 / 11 , the only perfect score in the history of the tournament . His book My 60 Memorable Games ( published 1969 ) became an icon of American chess literature and is regarded a masterwork . Fischer won the 1970 Interzonal Tournament by a record 3 ½ -point margin and won 20 consecutive games , including two unprecedented 6 – 0 sweeps in the Candidates Matches . In July 1971 , he became the first official FIDE number @-@ one @-@ rated player . 
 After losing his title as World Chess Champion , Fischer became reclusive and sometimes erratic , disappearing from both competitive chess and the public eye . In 1992 he reemerged to win an unofficial rematch against Spassky . It was held in Yugoslavia , which was under a United Nations embargo at the time . His participation led to a conflict with the U.S. government , which sought income tax on Fischer 's match winnings , and ultimately issued a warrant for his arrest . After that , he lived his life as an émigré . In the 1990s , Fischer patented a modified chess timing system that added a time increment after each move , now a standard practice in top tournament and match play . He also invented a new variant of chess named Fischerandom Chess . Fischer made many additional contributions to chess . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Bobby Fischer was born at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago , Illinois , on March 9 , 1943 . His birth certificate listed his father as Hans @-@ Gerhardt Fischer , also known as Gerardo <unk> , a German biophysicist . His mother , Regina Wender Fischer , was a U.S. citizen ; Regina was born in Switzerland , to Jewish parents from Poland and Russia . Raised in St. Louis , Missouri , Regina became a teacher , registered nurse , and later a physician . 
 After graduating from college in her teens , Regina traveled to Germany to visit her brother . It was there she met geneticist and future Nobel Prize winner , Hermann Joseph Muller , who persuaded Regina to move to Moscow to study medicine . She enrolled at I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University , where she met Hans @-@ Gerhardt , whom she married in November 1933 . In 1938 , Hans and Regina had a daughter , Joan Fischer . The reemergence of anti @-@ Semitism under Joseph Stalin prompted Regina to go with Joan to Paris , France , where Regina became an English teacher . The threat of a German invasion led her and Joan to go to the United States in 1939 . Hans @-@ Gerhardt attempted to follow the pair but his German citizenship barred him from entering the United States . Regina and Hans @-@ Gerhardt had separated in Moscow , although they did not officially divorce until 1945 . 
 At the time of her son 's birth , Regina was " homeless " and shuttled to different jobs and schools around the country to support her family . She engaged in political activism , and raised both Bobby and Joan as a single parent . 
 In 1949 , the family moved to Brooklyn , New York , where she studied for her master 's degree in nursing and subsequently began working in that field . 
 = = = Paul Nemenyi as Fischer 's father = = = 
 Sources implying that Paul Nemenyi , a Hungarian Jewish physicist and an expert in fluid and applied mechanics , may have been Fischer 's biological father were first made public in a 2002 investigation by Peter Nicholas and Clea Benson of The Philadelphia Inquirer . Throughout the 1950s , the FBI investigated Regina and her circle for her alleged communist sympathies , as well as her previous life in Moscow . The FBI files identify Paul Nemenyi as Bobby Fischer 's biological father , showing that Hans @-@ Gerhardt Fischer never entered the United States , having been refused admission by U.S. immigration officials due to his alleged Communist sympathies . Not only were Regina and Nemenyi reported to have had an affair in 1942 , but Nemenyi made monthly child support payments to Regina and paid for Bobby 's schooling until his own death in 1952 . Nemenyi had lodged complaints with social workers , saying he was concerned about the way that Regina was raising Bobby , to the point that , on at least one occasion , Nemenyi broke down in tears . Later on Bobby told the Hungarian chess player Zita <unk> that Paul Nemenyi would sometimes show up at the family 's Brooklyn apartment and take him on outings . After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952 , Regina Fischer wrote a letter to Paul Nemenyi 's first son ( Peter ) , asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will : 
 Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or medicine was out of the question . I don 't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby . 
 On one occasion , Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans @-@ Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939 , four years before Bobby was born . On another occasion , she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans @-@ Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting . According to Bobby Fischer 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , Russell Targ , who was married to Bobby 's half @-@ sister , Joan , for 40 years , Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby 's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out @-@ of @-@ wedlock birth .

 In March 1949 , 6 @-@ year @-@ old Bobby and his sister Joan learned how to play chess using the instructions from a set bought at a candy store . When Joan lost interest in chess and Regina did not have time to play , it left Fischer to play many of his first games against himself . When the family vacationed at Patchogue , Long Island that summer , Bobby found a book of old chess games and studied it intensely . Fischer biographer Frank Brady describes the family 's move from Manhattan to Brooklyn in 1950 : 
 In the fall of 1950 , Regina moved the family out of Manhattan and across the bridge to Brooklyn , where she rented an inexpensive apartment near the intersection of Union and Franklin streets . It was only temporary : She was trying to get closer to a better neighborhood . <unk> of her medical degree in Russia because of the war , she was now determined to acquire a nursing diploma . As soon as she enrolled in the Prospect Heights School of Nursing , the peripatetic Fischer family , citizens of nowhere , moved once again — its tenth transit in six years — to a $ 52 @-@ a @-@ month two @-@ bedroom flat at 560 Lincoln Place in Brooklyn . 
 The family resided in apartment Q , a " small , basic , but habitable " apartment . It was there that " Fischer soon became so engrossed in the game that Regina feared he was spending too much time alone " . As a result , on November 14 , 1950 , Regina sent a postcard to the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper , seeking to place an ad inquiring whether other children of Bobby 's age might be interested in playing chess with him . The paper rejected her ad because no one could figure out how to classify it , but forwarded her inquiry to Hermann Helms , the " Dean of American Chess " , who told her that Master Max Pavey , former Scottish champion , would be giving a simultaneous exhibition on January 17 , 1951 . Fischer played in the exhibition . Although he held on for 15 minutes , even drawing a crowd of onlookers , he eventually lost to the chess master . 
 One of the spectators was Brooklyn Chess Club President , Carmine Nigro , an American chess expert of near master strength and an instructor . Nigro was so impressed with Fischer 's play that he introduced him to the club and began teaching him . Fischer noted of his time with Nigro : " Mr. Nigro was possibly not the best player in the world , but he was a very good teacher . Meeting him was probably a decisive factor in my going ahead with chess . " 
 Nigro hosted Fischer 's first chess tournament at his home in 1952 . In the summer of 1955 , Fischer , then 12 years old , joined the Manhattan Chess Club , the strongest chess club in the country . Fischer 's relationship with Nigro lasted until 1956 , when Nigro moved away . 
 = = = = Mentorship from Lombardy = = = = 
 Nigro introduced Fischer to future grandmaster William Lombardy , and , starting in September 1954 , Lombardy began coaching Fischer in private . " We spent hours in our sessions , simply playing over quality games , " said Lombardy . " I tried to instill in Bobby the secret of my own speedy rise . Eidetic Imagery and Total Immersion . " Based on a 1956 game Lombardy played against Povilas <unk> ( in which he agreed to a draw offer after only 13 moves ) , Lombardy told Fischer : " Do not accept draw offers . For an ambitious and talented player , accepting a draw is death to a top result . Opponents fear an uncompromising opponent and thus make more mistakes . Act as I advise and do not copy my timidity . " Lombardy played a key part in Fischer 's becoming World Champion . He was Fischer 's aide at Portorož where they analyzed Fischer 's games . He was Bobby 's second in Reykjavik , where he analyzed with Fischer , and helped keep Fischer in the match . 
 = = = The Hawthorne Chess Club = = = 
 In June 1956 , Fischer began attending the Hawthorne Chess Club , based in master John " Jack " W. Collins ' home . For years it was believed that Collins was Fischer 's teacher and coach , even though Collins stated that he did not teach Fischer . It is now believed that Collins was Fischer 's mentor , not his teacher or coach . A mentor and a friend , Fischer played thousands of blitz and offhand games with Collins and other strong players , studied the books in Collins ' large chess library , and ate almost as many dinners at Collins ' home as his own . 
 Future grandmaster Arnold Denker was also a mentor to young Bobby , often taking him to watch the New York Rangers play hockey at Madison Square Garden . Bobby enjoyed those treats and never forgot them ; the two became lifelong friends . 
 = = Young champion = = 
 In 1956 , Fischer experienced a " meteoric rise " in his playing strength . On the tenth national rating list of the United States Chess Federation ( USCF ) , published on May 20 , 1956 , Fischer 's rating was 1726 , more than 900 points below top @-@ rated Samuel Reshevsky ( <unk> ) . 
 In March 1956 , the Log Cabin Chess Club of Orange , New Jersey , took Fischer on a tour to Cuba , where he gave a 12 @-@ board simultaneous exhibition at Havana 's Capablanca Chess Club , winning ten games and drawing two . On this tour the club played a series of matches against other clubs . Fischer played second board , behind International Master Norman Whitaker . Whitaker and Fischer were the leading scorers for the club , each scoring 5 ½ points out of 7 games . 
 In July 1956 , Fischer won the U.S. Junior Chess Championship , scoring 8 ½ / 10 at Philadelphia to become the youngest @-@ ever Junior Champion at age 13 . At the 1956 U.S. Open Chess Championship in Oklahoma City , Bobby scored 8 ½ / 12 to tie for 4 – 8th places , with Arthur Bisguier winning . In the first Canadian Open Chess Championship at Montreal 1956 , Bobby scored 7 / 10 to tie for 8 – 12th places , with Larry Evans winning . In November , Fischer played in the 1956 Eastern States Open Championship in Washington , D.C. , tying for second with William Lombardy , Nicholas <unk> , and Arthur Feuerstein , with Hans Berliner taking first by a half @-@ point . 
 Fischer accepted an invitation to play in the Third Lessing J. Rosenwald Trophy Tournament in New York City ( 1956 ) , a premier tournament limited to the 12 players considered the best in the country . Although Fischer 's rating was not among the top 12 in the country , he received entry by special consideration . Playing against top opposition , the 13 @-@ year @-@ old Fischer could only score 4 ½ / 11 , tying for 8 – 9th place . Yet , Bobby won the brilliancy prize for his ' " immortal " ' game against International Master Donald Byrne , in which Bobby sacrificed his queen to unleash an unstoppable attack . Hans Kmoch called it " The Game of the Century " . Wrote Kmoch , " The following game , a stunning masterpiece of combination play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent , matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies " . " ' The Game of the Century ' has been talked about , analyzed , and admired for more than fifty years , and it will probably be a part of the canon of chess for many years to come . " " In reflecting on his game a while after it occurred , Bobby was refreshingly modest : ' I just made the moves I thought were best . I was just lucky . ' " 
 In 1957 , Fischer played a two @-@ game match against former World Champion Max Euwe at New York , losing ½ – 1 ½ . On the USCF 's eleventh national rating list , published on May 5 , 1957 , Fischer was rated <unk> — over 500 points higher than his rating a year before . This made him the country 's youngest ever chess master , up to that point . In July , Bobby successfully defended his U.S. Junior title , scoring 8 ½ / 9 at San Francisco . As a result of his strong tournament results , Fischer 's rating went up to 2298 , " making him among the top ten active players in the country " . In August , Fischer scored 10 / 12 at the U.S. Open Chess Championship in Cleveland , winning on tie @-@ breaking points over Arthur Bisguier . This made Bobby the youngest ever U.S. Open Champion . Bobby won the New Jersey Open Championship , scoring 6 ½ / 7 . He then defeated the young Filipino master Rodolfo Tan Cardoso 6 – 2 in a New York match sponsored by Pepsi @-@ Cola . 
 = = = Wins first U.S. title = = = 
 Based on Fischer 's rating and strong results , the USCF invited him to play in the 1957 – 58 U.S. Championship . The tournament included such luminaries as six @-@ time U.S. champion Samuel Reshevsky , defending U.S. champion Arthur Bisguier , and William Lombardy , who in August had won the World Junior Championship with the only perfect score ( 11 – 0 ) in the history of the event . Bisguier predicted that Fischer would " finish slightly over the center mark " . Despite all the predictions to the contrary , Fischer scored eight wins and five draws to win the tournament by a one @-@ point margin , with 10 ½ / 13 . Still two months shy of his 15th birthday , Fischer became the youngest ever U.S. Champion . Since the championship that year was also the U.S. Zonal Championship , Fischer 's victory earned him the title of International Master . Fischer 's victory in the U.S. Championship sent his rating up to <unk> , making him the second highest rated player in the United States , behind only Reshevsky ( <unk> ) , and qualified him to participate in the 1958 Portorož Interzonal , the next step toward challenging the World Champion .

 Bobby wanted to go to Moscow . At his pleading , " Regina wrote directly to the Soviet leader , Nikita Khrushchev , requesting an invitation for Bobby to participate in the World Youth and Student Festival . The reply — affirmative — came too late for him to go . " Regina did not have the money to pay the airfare , but in the following year Fischer was invited onto the game show I 've Got a Secret , where , thanks to Regina 's efforts , the producers of the show arranged two round @-@ trip tickets to Russia . 
 Once in Russia , Fischer was invited by the Soviet Union to Moscow , where International Master Lev <unk> would serve as a guide to Bobby and his sister , Joan . Upon arrival , Fischer immediately demanded that he be taken to the Moscow Central Chess Club , where he played speed chess with " two young Soviet masters " , Evgeni <unk> and Alexander Nikitin , winning every game . Chess author V. I. Linder writes about the impression Fischer gave grandmaster Vladimir Alatortsev when he played blitz against the Soviet masters : " Back in 1958 , in the Central Chess Club , Vladimir Alatortsev saw a tall , angular 15 @-@ year @-@ old youth , who in blitz games , crushed almost everyone who crossed his path ... Alatortsev was no exception , losing all three games . He was astonished by the play of the young American Robert Fischer , his fantastic self @-@ confidence , amazing chess erudition and simply brilliant play ! On arriving home , Vladimir said in admiration to his wife : ' This is the future world champion ! ' " 
 Fischer demanded to play against Mikhail Botvinnik , the reigning World Champion . When told that this was impossible , Fischer asked to play Keres . " Finally , Tigran Petrosian was , on a semi @-@ official basis , summoned to the club ... " where he played speed games with Fischer , winning the majority . " When Bobby discovered that he wasn 't going to play any formal games ... he went into a not @-@ so @-@ silent rage " , saying he was fed up " with these Russian pigs " , which angered the Soviets who saw Fischer as their honored guest . It was then that the Yugoslavian chess officials offered to take in Fischer and Joan as early guests to the Interzonal . Fischer took them up on the offer , arriving in Yugoslavia to play two short training matches against masters Dragoljub <unk> and Milan <unk> . Fischer drew both games against <unk> and then defeated <unk> in Belgrade by 2 ½ – 1 ½ . 
 The top six finishers in the Interzonal would qualify for the Candidates Tournament . Most observers doubted that a 15 @-@ year @-@ old with no international experience could finish among the six qualifiers at the Interzonal , but Fischer told journalist Miro <unk> , " I can draw with the grandmasters , and there are half @-@ a @-@ dozen <unk> in the tournament I reckon to beat . " Despite some bumps in the road and a problematic start , Fischer succeeded in his plan : after a strong finish , he ended up with 12 / 20 ( + 6 − 2 = 12 ) to tie for 5 – 6th . The Soviet grandmaster Yuri Averbakh observed , 
 In the struggle at the board this youth , almost still a child , showed himself to be a full @-@ fledged fighter , demonstrating amazing composure , precise calculation and devilish resourcefulness . I was especially struck not even by his extensive opening knowledge , but his striving everywhere to seek new paths . In Fischer 's play an enormous talent was noticeable , and in addition one sensed an enormous amount of work on the study of chess . 
 Soviet grandmaster David Bronstein said of Fischer 's time in Portorož : " It was interesting for me to observe Fischer , but for a long time I couldn 't understand why this 15 @-@ year @-@ old boy played chess so well " . Fischer became the youngest person ever to qualify for the Candidates and the youngest ever grandmaster at 15 years , 6 months , 1 day . " By then everyone knew we had a genius on our hands . " 
 Before the Candidates ' Tournament , Fischer won the 1958 – 59 U.S. Championship ( scoring 8 ½ / 11 ) . He tied for third ( with Borislav <unk> ) in Mar del Plata ( scoring 10 / 14 ) , a half @-@ point behind <unk> Pachman and Miguel Najdorf . He tied for 4 – 6th in Santiago ( scoring 7 ½ / 12 ) behind <unk> , Pachman , and Herman <unk> . 
 At the Zürich International Tournament , spring 1959 , Fischer finished a point behind future World Champion Mikhail Tal and a half @-@ point behind Yugoslavian grandmaster Svetozar Gligorić . Tal recalled Fischer 's uncompromising style : " In his game with the oldest competitor , the Hungarian grandmaster Gedeon Barcza , Fischer had no advantage , but , not wishing to let his opponent go in peace , played on to the 103rd move . The game was adjourned three times and the contestants used up two score sheets , but even when there were only the kings left on the board , Fischer made two more moves ! Draw ! Stunned by such a fanatical onslaught , Barcza could barely get up from his chair , but Bobby nonchalantly suggested : ' Let 's have a look at the game from the beginning ... ' Barcza then began pleading : ' Look , I have a wife and children . Who 's going to support them in the event of my untimely death ! ' " 
 Although Fischer had ended his formal education at age 16 , dropping out of Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn , he subsequently taught himself several foreign languages so he could read foreign chess periodicals . According to Latvian chess master Alexander <unk> , even he and Tal could not match the commitment that Fischer had made to chess . Recalling a conversation from the tournament : " ' Tell me , Bobby , ' Tal continued , ' what do you think of the playing style of Larissa <unk> ? ' ' She 's too cautious . But you have another girl , Dmitrieva . Her games do appeal to me ! ' Here we were left literally open @-@ mouthed in astonishment . Misha and I have looked at thousands of games , but it never even occurred to us to study the games of our women players . How could we find the time for this ? ! Yet Bobby , it turns out , had found the time ! ' " 
 Until late 1959 , Fischer " had dressed atrociously for a champion , appearing at the most august and distinguished national and international events in sweaters and <unk> . " A director of the Manhattan Chess Club had once banned Fischer for not being " properly <unk> " , forcing Denker to intercede to get him reinstated . Now , encouraged by Pal Benko to dress more smartly , Fischer " began buying suits from all over the world , hand @-@ tailored and made to order . " He told journalist Ralph Ginzburg that he had 17 hand @-@ tailored suits and that all of his shirts and shoes were handmade . 
 At the age of 16 , Fischer finished equal fifth out of eight ( the top non @-@ Soviet player ) at the 1959 Candidates Tournament in Bled / Zagreb / Belgrade , Yugoslavia , scoring 12 ½ / 28 . He was outclassed by tournament winner Tal , who won all four of their individual games . That year , Fischer released his first book of collected games : Bobby Fischer 's Games of Chess , published by Simon & Schuster . 
 = = = Drops out of school = = = 
 Bobby 's interest in chess became more important than schoolwork , to the point that " by the time he reached the fourth grade , he 'd been in and out of six schools . " In 1952 , Regina got Bobby a scholarship ( based on his chess talent and " astronomically high IQ " ) to Brooklyn Community Woodward . Fischer later attended Erasmus Hall High School at the same time as Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond . In 1959 , its student council awarded him a gold medal for his chess achievements . The same year , Fischer dropped out of high school when he turned age 16 , the earliest he could legally do so . He later explained to Ralph Ginzburg , " You don 't learn anything in school . " 
 When Fischer was 16 , his mother moved out of their apartment to pursue medical training . Her friend Joan Rodker , who had met Regina when the two were " idealistic communists " living in Moscow in the 1930s , believes that Fischer resented his mother for being mostly absent as a mother , a communist activist and an admirer of the Soviet Union and that this led to his hatred for the Soviet Union . In letters to Rodker , Fischer 's mother states her desire to pursue her own " obsession " of training in medicine and writes that her son would have to live in their Brooklyn apartment without her : " It sounds terrible to leave a 16 @-@ year @-@ old to his own devices , but he is probably happier that way " . The apartment was on the edge of Bedford @-@ Stuyvesant , a neighborhood that had one of the highest homicide and general crime rates in New York City . Despite the alienation from her son , Regina , in 1960 , protested the practices of the American Chess Foundation and staged a five @-@ hour protest in front of the White House , urging President Dwight Eisenhower to send an American team to that year 's chess Olympiad ( set for Leipzig , East Germany , behind the Iron Curtain ) and to help support the team financially . 
 = = U.S. Championships = = 
 Fischer played in eight U.S. Championships , winning all of them , by at least a one @-@ point margin . His results were : 
 Fischer missed the 1961 – 62 Championship ( he was preparing for the 1962 Interzonal ) , and there was no 1964 – 65 event . Out of eight U.S. Chess Championships , Fischer lost only three games ; to <unk> <unk> in the 1962 – 63 event , and in consecutive rounds to Samuel Reshevsky , and Robert Byrne in the 1965 championship , culminating in a total score of 74 / 90 ( 61 wins , 26 draws , 3 losses ) . 
 = = Olympiads = = 
 Fischer refused to play in the 1958 Munich Olympiad when his demand to play first board ahead of Samuel Reshevsky was rejected . Some sources claim that 15 @-@ year @-@ old Fischer was unable to arrange leave from attending high school . Fischer would later represent the United States on first board at four Men 's Chess Olympiads , winning two individual Silver and one individual Bronze medals : 
 Out of four Men 's Chess Olympiads , Fischer scored + 40 − 7 = 18 , for 49 / 65 : 75 @.@ 4 % . In 1966 , Fischer narrowly missed the individual gold medal , scoring 88 @.@ 23 % to World Champion Tigran Petrosian 's 88 @.@ 46 % , even though he played four games more than Petrosian , faced stiffer opposition , and would have won the gold if he had accepted Florin Gheorghiu 's draw offer , rather than declining it and suffering his only loss . 
 At the 1962 Varna Olympiad , Fischer predicted that he would defeat Argentinian GM Miguel Najdorf in 25 moves . Fischer actually did it in 24 , becoming the only player to beat Najdorf in the tournament . Ironically , Najdorf lost the game whilst employing the very opening variation named after him : the Sicilian Najdorf . 
 Fischer had planned to play for the U.S. at the 1968 Lugano Olympiad , but backed out when he saw the poor playing conditions . Both former World Champion Tigran Petrosian and Belgian @-@ American International Master George Koltanowski , the " leader of the American team " that year , felt that Fischer was " justified " in not participating in the Olympiad . According to Lombardy , Fischer 's non @-@ participation was due to Reshevsky 's refusal to " yield first board " . 
 = = 1960 – 61 = = 
 In 1960 , Fischer tied for first place with Soviet star Boris Spassky at the strong Mar del Plata Tournament in Argentina , winning by a two @-@ point margin , scoring 13 ½ / 15 ( + 13 − 1 = 1 ) , ahead of David Bronstein . Fischer lost only to Spassky ; this was the start of their lifelong friendship . 
 Fischer experienced the only failure in his competitive career at the Buenos Aires Tournament ( 1960 ) , finishing with 8 ½ / 19 ( + 3 − 5 = 11 ) , far behind winners Viktor Korchnoi and Samuel Reshevsky with 13 / 19 . According to Larry Evans , Fischer 's first sexual experience was with a girl to whom Evans introduced him during the tournament . Pal Benko says that Fischer did horribly in the tournament " because he got caught up in women and sex . Afterwards , Fischer said he 'd never mix women and chess together , and kept the promise . " Fischer concluded 1960 by winning a small tournament in Reykjavík with 4 ½ / 5 , and defeating Klaus <unk> in an exhibition game in West Berlin . 
 In 1961 , Fischer started a 16 @-@ game match with Reshevsky , split between New York and Los Angeles . Reshevsky , 32 years Fischer 's senior , was considered the favorite , since he had far more match experience and had never lost a set match . After 11 games and a tie score ( two wins apiece with seven draws ) , the match ended prematurely due to a scheduling dispute between Fischer and match organizer and sponsor Jacqueline Piatigorsky . Reshevsky was declared the winner , by default , and received the winner 's share of the prize fund . 
 Fischer was second in a super @-@ class field , behind only former World Champion Tal , at Bled , 1961 . Yet , Fischer defeated Tal head @-@ to @-@ head for the first time in their individual game , scored 3 ½ / 4 against the Soviet contingent , and finished as the only unbeaten player , with 13 ½ / 19 ( + 8 − 0 = 11 ) . 
 = = 1962 : success , setback , accusations of collusion = = 
 Fischer won the 1962 Stockholm Interzonal by a 2 ½ -point margin , going undefeated , with 17 ½ / 22 ( + 13 − 0 = 9 ) . He was the first non @-@ Soviet player to win an Interzonal since FIDE instituted the tournament in 1948 . Russian grandmaster Alexander Kotov said of Fischer : 
 I have discussed Fischer 's play with Max Euwe and Gideon <unk> . All of us , experienced ' tournament old @-@ timers ' , were surprised by Fischer 's endgame expertise . When a young player is good at attacking or at combinations , this is understandable , but a faultless endgame technique at the age of 19 is something rare . I can recall only one other player who at that age was equally skillful at endgames — Vasily Smyslov . 
 Fischer 's victory made him a favorite for the Candidates Tournament in Curaçao . Yet , despite his result in the Interzonal , Fischer only finished fourth out of eight with 14 / 27 ( + 8 − 7 = 12 ) , far behind Tigran Petrosian ( 17 ½ / 27 ) , Efim Geller , and Paul Keres ( both 17 / 27 ) . Tal fell very ill during the tournament , and had to withdraw before completion . Fischer , a friend of Tal , was the only contestant who visited him in the hospital . 
 = = = <unk> Soviets of collusion = = = 
 Following his failure in the 1962 Candidates , Fischer asserted , in an August 20 , 1962 Sports Illustrated article , entitled " The Russians Have Fixed World Chess " , that three of the five Soviet players ( Tigran Petrosian , Paul Keres , and Efim Geller ) had a prearranged agreement to quickly draw their games against each other in order to conserve their energy for playing against Fischer . It is generally thought that this accusation is correct . Fischer stated that he would never again participate in a Candidates ' tournament , since the format , combined with the alleged collusion , made it impossible for a non @-@ Soviet player to win . Following Fischer 's article , FIDE , in late 1962 , voted to implement a radical reform of the playoff system , replacing the Candidates ' tournament with a format of one @-@ on @-@ one knockout matches ; the format that Fischer would dominate in 1971 . 
 Fischer defeated Bent Larsen in a summer 1962 exhibition game in Copenhagen for Danish TV . Later that year , Fischer beat Bogdan <unk> in a team match against Poland in Warsaw . 
 In the 1962 – 63 U.S. Championship , Fischer experienced his first single @-@ game loss ( to <unk> <unk> ) in round one . Bisguier was in excellent form , and Fischer caught up to him only at the end . Tied at 7 – 3 , the two met in the final round . Bisguier stood well in the middlegame , but blundered , handing Fischer his fifth consecutive U.S. championship . 
 = = Semi @-@ retirement in the mid @-@ 1960s = = 
 Influenced by ill will over the aborted 1961 match against Reshevsky , Fischer declined an invitation to play in the 1963 Piatigorsky Cup tournament in Los Angeles , which had a world @-@ class field . He instead played in the Western Open in Bay City , Michigan , which he won with 7 ½ / 8 . In August – September 1963 , Fischer won the New York State Championship at Poughkeepsie , with 7 / 7 , his first perfect score , " ahead of Bisguier and Sherwin " . 
 In the 1963 – 64 U.S. Championship , Fischer achieved his second perfect score , this time against the top @-@ ranked chess players in the country : " This tournament became , as they say , the stuff of legend . The fact that Fischer won his sixth U.S. title was no surprise . The way he did it was spectacular . " " One by one Fischer mowed down the opposition as he cut an 11 – 0 swathe through the field , to demonstrate convincingly to the opposition that he was now in a class by himself . " This result brought Fischer heightened fame , including a profile in Life magazine . Sports Illustrated diagrammed each of the 11 games in its article , " The Amazing Victory Streak of Bobby Fischer " . Such extensive chess coverage was groundbreaking for the top American sports ' magazine . His 11 – 0 win in the 1963 – 64 Championship is the only perfect score in the history of the tournament , and one of about ten perfect scores in high @-@ level chess tournaments ever . David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld called it " the most remarkable achievement of this kind " . Fischer recalls : " Motivated by my lopsided result ( 11 – 0 ! ) , Dr. [ Hans ] Kmoch congratulated [ Larry ] Evans ( the runner up ) on ' winning ' the tournament ... and then he congratulated me on ' winning the exhibition ' . " 
 International Master Anthony Saidy recalled his last round encounter with the undefeated Fischer : 
 Going into the final game I certainly did not expect to upset Fischer . I hardly knew the opening but played simply , and he went along with the scenario , opting for a N @-@ v @-@ B [ i.e. , Knight vs. Bishop ] endgame with a minimal edge . In the corridor , Evans said to me , ' Good . Show him we 're not all <unk> 
 At adjournment , Saidy saw a way to force a draw , yet " sealed a different , wrong move " , and lost . " The rest is history . " " Chess publications around the world wrote of the unparalleled achievement . Only Bent Larsen , always a Fischer detractor , was unimpressed : ' Fischer was playing against children ' " . 
 Fischer , eligible as U.S. Champion , decided against his participation in the 1964 Amsterdam Interzonal , taking himself out of the 1966 World Championship cycle , even after FIDE changed the format of the eight @-@ player Candidates Tournament from a round @-@ robin to a series of knockout matches , which eliminated the possibility of collusion . Instead , Fischer embarked on a tour of the United States and Canada from February through May , playing a simultaneous exhibition , and giving a lecture in each of more than 40 cities . His 94 % winning percentage over more than 2 @,@ 000 games is one of the best ever achieved . Fischer declined an invitation to play for the U.S. in the 1964 Olympiad in Tel Aviv . 
 = = Successful return = = 
 Fischer wanted to play in the Capablanca Memorial Tournament , Havana in August and September 1965 . Since the State Department refused to endorse Fischer 's passport as valid for visiting Cuba , he proposed , and the tournament officials and players accepted , a unique arrangement : Fischer played his moves from a room at the Marshall Chess Club , which were then transmitted by teleprinter to Cuba . Luděk Pachman observed that Fischer " was handicapped by the longer playing session resulting from the time wasted in transmitting the moves , and that is one reason why he lost to three of his chief rivals . " The tournament was an " ordeal " for Fischer , who had to endure eight @-@ hour and sometimes even twelve @-@ hour playing sessions . Despite the handicap , Fischer tied for second through fourth places , with 15 / 21 ( + 12 − 3 = 6 ) , behind former World Champion Vasily Smyslov , whom Fischer defeated in their individual game . The tournament received extensive media coverage . 
 In December , Fischer won his seventh U.S. Championship ( 1965 ) , with the score of 8 ½ / 11 ( + 8 − 2 = 1 ) , despite losing to Robert Byrne and Reshevsky in the eighth and ninth rounds . Fischer also reconciled with Mrs. Piatigorsky , accepting an invitation to the very strong second Piatigorsky Cup ( 1966 ) tournament in Santa Monica . Fischer began disastrously and after eight rounds was tied for last with 3 / 8 . He then staged " the most sensational comeback in the history of grandmaster chess " , scoring 7 / 8 in the next eight rounds . In the end , World Chess Championship finalist Boris Spassky edged him out by a half point , scoring 11 ½ / 18 to Fischer 's 11 / 18 ( + 7 − 3 = 8 ) . Now aged 23 , Fischer would win every match or tournament he completed for the rest of his life . 
 Fischer won the U.S. Championship ( 1966 – 67 ) for the eighth and final time , ceding only three draws ( + 8 − 0 = 3 ) , In March – April and August – September , Fischer won strong tournaments at Monte Carlo , with 7 / 9 ( + 6 − 1 = 2 ) , and Skopje , with 13 ½ / 17 ( + 12 − 2 = 3 ) . In the Philippines , Fischer played nine exhibition games against master opponents , scoring 8 ½ / 9 .

 Fischer 's win in the 1966 – 67 U.S. Championship qualified him for the next World Championship cycle . 
 At the 1967 Interzonal , held at Sousse , Tunisia , Fischer scored 8 ½ points in the first 10 games , to lead the field . His observance of the Worldwide Church of God 's seventh @-@ day Sabbath was honored by the organizers , but deprived Fischer of several rest days , which led to a scheduling dispute , causing Fischer to forfeit two games in protest and later withdraw , eliminating himself from the 1969 World Championship cycle . Communications difficulties with the highly inexperienced local organizers were also a significant factor , since Fischer knew no French and the organizers had very limited English . No one in Tunisian chess had previous experience running an event of this stature . 
 Since Fischer had completed less than half of his scheduled games , all of his results were annulled , meaning players who had played Fischer had those games cancelled , and the scores nullified from the official tournament record .

 In 1968 , Fischer won tournaments at Netanya , with 11 ½ / 13 ( + 10 − 0 = 3 ) , and Vinkovci , with 11 / 13 ( + 9 − 0 = 4 ) , by large margins . Fischer then stopped playing for the next 18 months , except for a win against Anthony Saidy in a 1969 New York Metropolitan League team match . That year , Fischer ( assisted by grandmaster Larry Evans ) released his second book of collected games : My 60 Memorable Games , published by Simon & Schuster . The book " was an immediate success " .

 In 1970 , Fischer began a new effort to become World Champion . His dramatic march toward the title made him a household name and made chess front @-@ page news for a time . He won the title in 1972 , but forfeited it three years later . 
 = = = Road to the World Championship = = = 
 The 1969 U.S. Championship was also a zonal qualifier , with the top three finishers advancing to the Interzonal . Fischer , however , had sat out the U.S. Championship because of disagreements about the tournament 's format and prize fund . Benko , one of the three qualifiers , agreed to give up his spot in the Interzonal in order to give Fischer another shot at the World Championship . " When it was suggested to Fischer that Benko was considering the gesture based on a large sum of money to be paid to him , Bobby replied that Benko would not give up his berth for money alone . It was a matter of honor " . " Lombardy , who was next in line with the right to participate , was queried as to whether he would also step aside . ' I would like to play , ' he answered , ' but Fischer should have the chance . ' " 
 In 1970 and 1971 , Fischer " dominated his contemporaries to an extent never seen before or since " . 
 Before the Interzonal , in March and April 1970 , the world 's best players competed in the USSR vs. Rest of the World match in Belgrade , Yugoslavia , often referred to as " the Match of the Century " . There was much surprise when Fischer decided to participate : 
 Fischer had not played competitive chess for eighteen months , and many thought he would never return . Then , to general surprise and delight , he agreed to participate in the Soviet Union vs. the Rest of the World in 1970 in Belgrade . 
 With Evans as his second , Fischer flew to Belgrade with the intention of playing board one for the rest of the world . Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen , however , ( due to his recent tournament victories ) demanded to play first board instead of Fischer , even though Fischer had the higher Elo rating . To the surprise of everyone , Fischer agreed . Although the USSR team eked out a 20 ½ – 19 ½ victory , " On the top four boards , the Soviets managed to win only one game out of a possible sixteen . Bobby Fischer was the high scorer for his team , with a 3 – 1 score against Petrosian ( two wins and two draws ) " . " Fischer left no doubt in anyone 's mind that he had put his temporary break from the tournament circuit to good use . Petrosian was almost unrecognizable in the first two games , and by the time he had collected himself , although pressing his opponent , he could do no more than draw the last two games of the four @-@ game set " . 
 After the USSR versus the Rest of the World Match , the unofficial World Championship of Lightning Chess ( 5 @-@ minute games ) was held at Herceg Novi . " [ The Russians ] figured on teaching Fischer a lesson and on bringing him down a peg or two " . Petrosian and Tal were considered the favorites , but Fischer overwhelmed the super @-@ class field with 19 / 22 ( + 17 − 1 = 4 ) , far ahead of Tal ( 14 ½ ) , Korchnoi ( 14 ) , Petrosian ( 13 ½ ) , and Bronstein ( 13 ) . Fischer lost only one game ( to Korchnoi , who was also the only player to achieve an even score against him in the double round robin tournament ) . Fischer " crushed such blitz kings as Tal , Petrosian and Vasily Smyslov by a clean score " . Tal marveled that , " During the entire tournament he didn 't leave a single pawn en prise ! " , while the other players " blundered knights and bishops galore " . For Lombardy , who had played many blitz games with Fischer , Fischer 's 4 ½ -point margin of victory " came as a pleasant surprise " . 
 In April – May 1970 , Fischer won at Rovinj / Zagreb with 13 / 17 ( + 10 − 1 = 6 ) , by a two @-@ point margin , ahead of Gligorić , Hort , Korchnoi , Smyslov , and Petrosian . In July – August , Fischer crushed the mostly grandmaster field at Buenos Aires , winning by a 3 ½ -point margin , scoring 15 / 17 ( + 13 − 0 = 4 ) . Fischer then played first board for the U.S. Team in the 19th Chess Olympiad in Siegen , where he won an individual Silver medal , scoring 10 / 13 ( + 8 − 1 = 4 ) , with his only loss being to World Champion Boris Spassky . Right after the Olympiad , Fischer defeated Ulf Andersson in an exhibition game for the Swedish newspaper Expressen . Fischer had taken his game to a new level . 
 Fischer won the Interzonal ( held in Palma de Mallorca in November and December 1970 ) with 18 ½ / 23 ( + 15 − 1 = 7 ) , far ahead of Larsen , Efim Geller , and Robert Hübner , with 15 / 23 . Fischer finished the tournament with seven consecutive wins . Setting aside the Sousse Interzonal ( which Fischer withdrew from while leading ) , Fischer 's victory gave him a string of eight consecutive first prizes in tournaments . Former World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik was not , however , impressed by Fischer 's results , stating : " Fischer has been declared a genius . I do not agree with this ... In order to rightly be declared a genius in chess , you have to defeat equal opponents by a big margin . As yet he has not done this " . Despite Botvinnik 's remarks , " Fischer began a miraculous year in the history of chess " . 
 In the 1971 Candidates matches , Fischer was set to play against Soviet grandmaster and concert pianist Mark Taimanov in the quarter @-@ finals . " Their match was to begin in May 1971 in Vancouver , Canada , on the beautiful campus of the University of British Columbia " . " Analysts and players alike predicted that Fischer would win the Candidates , but not without a struggle . Tal predicted that Fischer would win 5 ½ – 4 ½ against Taimanov " . " [ Fischer ] saw himself as the firm favorite in the Taimanov match . He was not alone ; the <unk> press was of the same mind . Only Taimanov insisted that he could win , dismissing Fischer as a mere computer " . Taimanov had reason to be confident . He was backed by the firm guidance of Botvinnik , who " had thoroughly analysed Fischer 's record and put together a ' dossier ' on him " , from when he was in talks to play Fischer in a match " a couple of years earlier " . After Fischer defeated Taimanov in the second game of the match , Taimanov asked Fischer how he managed to come up with the move 12 . <unk> , to which Fischer replied " that the idea was not his — he had come across it in the monograph by the Soviet master Alexander Nikitin in a footnote " . Taimanov said of this : " It is staggering that I , an expert on the Sicilian , should have missed this theoretically significant idea by my compatriot , while Fischer had uncovered it in a book in a foreign language ! " With the score at 4 – 0 , in Fischer 's favor , the fifth game adjournment was a sight to behold . Schonberg explains the scene : 
 Taimanov came to Vancouver with two seconds , both grandmasters . Fischer was alone . He thought that the sight of Taimanov and his seconds was the funniest thing he had ever seen . There Taimanov and his seconds would sit , six hands flying , pocket sets waving in the air , while variations were being spouted all over the place . And there sat Taimanov with a confused look on his face . Just before resuming play [ in the fifth game ] the seconds were giving Taimanov some last @-@ minute advice . When poor Taimanov entered the playing room and sat down to confront Fischer , his head was so full of conflicting continuations that he became rattled , left a Rook en prise and immediately resigned . 
 Fischer beat Taimanov by the score of 6 – 0 . " The record books showed that the only comparable achievement to the 6 – 0 score against Taimanov was Wilhelm Steinitz 's 7 – 0 win against Joseph Henry Blackburne in 1876 in an era of more primitive defensive technique . " " Who would have imagined that any challenger 's match would ever have been decided by a perfect score , when the participants are all to be ranked among the strongest players in the world ? " " It is difficult to portray to non @-@ chess players the magnitude of such a shutout . A typical result between well @-@ matched players might be , say , six wins to four , with nine draws " . Taimanov later recalled , " When Grand Masters play , they see the logic of their opponent 's moves . One 's moves may be so powerful that the other may not be able to stop him , but the plan behind the moves will be clear . Not so with Fischer . His moves did not make sense ... " 
 Upon losing the final game of the match , Taimanov shrugged his shoulders , saying sadly to Fischer : " Well , I still have my music . " As a result of his performance , Taimanov " was thrown out of the USSR team and forbidden to travel for two years . He was banned from writing articles , was deprived of his monthly stipend ... [ and ] the authorities prohibited him from performing on the concert platform . " " The crushing loss virtually ended Taimanov 's chess career . " 
 Fischer was next scheduled to play against Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen . " Spassky predicted a tight struggle : ' Larsen is a little stronger in spirit . ' " Before the match , Botvinnik had told a Soviet television audience : 
 It is hard to say how their match will end , but it is clear that such an easy victory as in Vancouver [ against Taimanov ] will not be given to Fischer . I think Larsen has unpleasant surprises in store for [ Fischer ] , all the more since having dealt with Taimanov thus , Fischer will want to do just the same to Larsen and this is impossible . 
 Fischer beat Larsen by the score of 6 – 0 . Robert Byrne writes : " To a certain extent I could grasp the Taimanov match as a kind of curiosity – almost a freak , a strange chess occurrence that would never occur again . But now I am at a loss for anything whatever to say ... So , it is out of the question for me to explain how Bobby , how anyone , could win six games in a row from such a genius of the game as Bent Larsen " . Just a year before , Larsen had played first board for the Rest of the World team ahead of Fischer , and had handed Fischer his only loss at the Interzonal . Garry Kasparov later wrote that no player had ever shown a superiority over his rivals comparable to Fischer 's " incredible " 12 – 0 score in the two matches . Chess statistician Jeff Sonas concludes that the victory over Larsen gave Fischer the " highest single @-@ match performance rating ever " . 
 On August 8 , 1971 , while preparing for his last Candidates match with former World Champion Tigran Petrosian , Fischer played in the Manhattan Chess Club Rapid Tournament , winning with 21 ½ / 22 against a strong field . 
 Despite Fischer 's results against Taimanov and Larsen , his upcoming match against Petrosian seemed a daunting task . Nevertheless , the Soviet government was concerned about Fischer . " Reporters asked Petrosian whether the match would last the full twelve games ... ' It might be possible that I win it earlier , ' Petrosian replied " , and then stated : " Fischer 's [ nineteen consecutive ] wins do not impress me . He is a great chess player but no genius " . Petrosian played a strong theoretical novelty in the first game , gaining the advantage , but Fischer eventually won the game after Petrosian faltered . This gave Fischer a run of 20 consecutive wins against the world 's top players ( in the Interzonal and Candidates matches ) , a winning streak topped only by Steinitz 's 25 straight wins in 1873 – 82 . Petrosian won the second game , finally snapping Fischer 's streak . After three consecutive draws , Fischer swept the next four games to win the match 6 ½ – 2 ½ ( + 5 − 1 = 3 ) . Sports Illustrated ran an article on the match , highlighting Fischer 's domination of Petrosian as being due to Petrosian 's outdated system of preparation : 
 Fischer 's recent record raises the distinct possibility that he has made a breakthrough in modern chess theory . His response to Petrosian 's elaborately plotted 11th move in the first game is an example : Russian experts had worked on the variation for weeks , yet when it was thrown at Fischer suddenly , he faced its consequences alone and won by applying simple , classic principles . 
 Upon completion of the match , Petrosian remarked : " After the sixth game Fischer really did become a genius . I on the other hand , either had a breakdown or was tired , or something else happened , but the last three games were no longer chess . " " Some experts kept insisting that Petrosian was off form , and that he should have had a plus score at the end of the sixth game ... " to which Fischer replied , " People have been playing against me below strength for fifteen years . " Fischer 's match results befuddled Botvinnik : " It is hard to talk about Fischer 's matches . Since the time that he has been playing them , miracles have begun . " " When Petrosian played like Petrosian , Fischer played like a very strong grandmaster , but when Petrosian began making mistakes , Fischer was transformed into a genius . " 
 Fischer gained a far higher rating than any player in history up to that time . On the July 1972 FIDE rating list , his Elo rating of 2785 was 125 points above ( World No. 2 ) Spassky 's rating of 2660 . His results put him on the cover of Life magazine , and allowed him to challenge World Champion Boris Spassky , whom he had never beaten ( + 0 − 3 = 2 ) .
