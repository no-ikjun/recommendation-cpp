 A letter to Hagenauer dated 16 August indicated that Leopold wished to proceed to Turin , then across northern Italy to Venice , and home via the Tyrol . " Our own interest and love of travel should have induced us to follow our noses " , he wrote , but added : " ... I have said I shall go [ directly ] home and I shall keep my word " . The family took a shorter route through Switzerland , arriving in Geneva on 20 August , where the children gave two concerts , and were received by the distinguished composer André @-@ Ernest @-@ Modeste Grétry . Many years later Grétry wrote of this encounter : " I wrote for him [ Wolfgang ] an Allegro in E flat , difficult but without pretension ; he played it , and everyone , except myself , thought it was a miracle . The child had never broken off , but following the modulations , he had substituted a number of passages for those I had written " . This claim , that Wolfgang improvised when faced with passages he could not play , appears to be the only adverse comment from all those called upon to test him . 
 The journey through Switzerland continued , with concerts at Lausanne and Zurich . Since leaving the Netherlands , Wolfgang had composed little ; a minor harpsichord piece , K. 33B , written for the Zürich concerts , and later some cello pieces ( since lost ) written for the Prince of Fürstenberg . The prince received the party on 20 October , on its arrival in Donaueschingen on the German border , for a stay of some 12 days . Resuming their journey , they reached Munich on 8 November . They were delayed here for nearly two weeks after Wolfgang fell ill , but he was well enough to perform before the Elector , with Nannerl , on 22 November . A few days later they set out for Salzburg , arriving at their home on the <unk> on 29 November 1766 .

 The party had survived major setbacks , including several prolonged illnesses which had curtailed their earning powers . Although Leopold did not reveal the full extent of the tour 's earnings , or its expenses , the material benefits from the tour had evidently been considerable — but so had the costs . The librarian of St Peter 's Abbey , Salzburg , thought that the gifts ( " <unk> " ) alone which they brought back were worth about 12 @,@ 000 florins , but estimated the total costs of the enterprise at 20 @,@ 000 florins . The expenses were certainly high ; in a letter to Hagenauer sent in September 1763 , after ten weeks on the road , Leopold reported expenses to date as 1 @,@ 068 florins , an amount covered by their concert earnings without , however , any significant surplus . Leopold stated that " there was nothing to be saved , because we have to travel in noble or courtly style for the preservation of our health and the reputation of my court " . He later recorded that on arrival in Paris in November 1763 that they had " very little money " . 
 At times , the coffers were full ; in April 1764 , near the end of the Paris sojourn and after two successful concerts , Leopold announced he would shortly be depositing 2 @,@ 200 florins with his bankers . Two months later , after the initial London successes , Leopold banked a further 1 @,@ 100 florins . However , in November of that year , after his illness and with uncertain earning prospects , he was worrying about the high costs of living in London — he informed Hagenauer that he had spent 1 @,@ 870 florins in the four @-@ month period since July . The following summer , after little concert activity , Leopold resorted to increasingly desperate measures to raise funds , including the children 's daily circus performances at the Swan and Harp Inn at prices described by Jane Glover as humiliating . The insecurity of travelling life led Leopold to believe , later , that Wolfgang was not worldly @-@ wise enough to attempt such journeys alone , and needed to be anchored to an assured salary . 
 = = = Musical = = = 
 In terms of musical development , while both children had advanced , Wolfgang 's progress had been extraordinary , beyond all expectation . The Mozarts were now known throughout the musical establishments and royal courts of Northern Europe . As well as the encounters in palaces with kings , queens and nobility , the children could converse in several languages ; the tour represented , for them , an outstanding education . However , these advantages had been gained at a price ; Grimm , in Paris , noting the stress and strain on Wolfgang in particular , had feared that " so premature a fruit might fall before maturing " . However , Hildesheimer , while also expressing concerns , concludes that if Mozart 's death at the age of 35 was caused by the exertions of his childhood , the intervening decades would not have been so productive , and obvious symptoms of decline would have manifested themselves . 
 Of Wolfgang 's music composed during the tour , around thirty pieces survive . A number of works are lost , including the Zürich cello pieces and several symphonies . The surviving works include the keyboard sonatas written in Paris , London and The Hague , four symphonies , various arias , the assorted music written for the Prince of Orange , a Kyrie , and other minor pieces . Mozart 's career as a symphonist began in London where , in addition to the direct influences of Abel and J.C. Bach , he would have heard symphonies from leading London composers including Thomas Arne , William Boyce and Giuseppe <unk> — " a nearly ideal introduction to the genre " , according to Zaslaw . The earliest symphonies , Zaslaw points out , while not in the same class as the later Mozart masterpieces , are comparable in length , complexity and originality to those written at the same time by the acknowledged symphonic masters of the day . Indeed , Abel 's Symphony No. 6 in E Flat was similar enough in style and technique to be mistaken as Mozart 's , and is listed as such ( Symphony No. 3 , K. 18 ) in the original Köchel catalogue . Sadie observes that the K. 22 symphony composed in The Hague is a good deal more sophisticated than the earlier ones which were written in London . 
 Mozart 's creative progress is likewise reflected in the sonatas composed for the Princess of Orange , which , according to Sadie , mark a considerable advance in technique and ideas over the earlier Paris and London sets . The arias composed in the Netherlands include Mozart 's first attempts at " aria d <unk> " , Per <unk> , bell <unk> mio , K. <unk> , once thought to have been composed much later , as its higher K number indicates . The tour thus saw Wolfgang 's transformation from a composer of simple keyboard pieces to one with increasing mastery over a range of genres . This was evidenced in his home city , on 8 December , when one of his symphonies ( it is uncertain which ) was performed at High Mass at Salzburg Cathedral . Leopold 's employer , the Prince @-@ Archbishop , was frankly sceptical about Wolfgang 's compositions , believing them to be Leopold 's because they were " not nearly bad enough to be the work of a child " . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Whatever the true extent of their financial rewards from the tour , the Mozart family continued to live in their cramped apartment on the <unk> , while Leopold resumed his duties as a court musician . However , travel and public display dominated the next six years of Wolfgang 's life . In September 1767 the family was on the move again , this time to Vienna , remaining there ( apart from an enforced evacuation during a smallpox epidemic ) until January 1769 . In December of the same year Leopold and Wolfgang left for Italy — without Nannerl who , now 18 , was no longer <unk> as a child wonder . They were away for sixteen months , and returned to Milan in August 1771 for five months , to attend rehearsals and the performance of Wolfgang 's opera Ascanio in Alba . A third and final visit to Italy , from October 1772 until March 1773 , was the last of the extended trips ; the new Prince @-@ Archbishop of Salzburg , Hieronymous Colloredo , had distinct views about the roles of his court musicians , which precluded the freedoms that Leopold — and now Wolfgang , himself employed by the court — had formerly enjoyed . 
 = NSB Class 66 = 
 NSB Class 66 ( Norwegian : NSB type 66 ) was a three @-@ car electric train used by the Norwegian State Railways for express trains on the Østfold Line to Halden and Gothenburg , and the Sørlandet Line to Kristiansand and Stavanger . The four multiple units were built by Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk , with motors from Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri , and delivered in 1945 – 46 . They were originally named Class 106 , but this was changed in 1956 . The trains received the numbering BFM 66 @.@ 01 – 04 , B 66 @.@ 31 – 34 and BS 66 @.@ 61 – 64 . 
 The class was the electric counterpart of diesel Class 88 . With a power output of 474 kW ( 636 hp ) , it was the first train capable of 120 kilometers per hour ( 75 mph ) in Norway . One of the Class 66 trains was involved in the Hjuksebø train disaster in 1950 . Since 1967 , the trains served on the Vestfold Line . The Class 66 was retired from service in 1977 . BFM 66 @.@ 01 has been preserved by the Norwegian Railway Museum . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Four Class 66 units were ordered by the Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) in 1939 , to be used as express trains on the then newly or shortly @-@ to @-@ be electrified Sørland- and Østfold Lines . At the same time , similar Class 88 diesel multiple units were ordered for the non @-@ electrified <unk> and Dovre Lines . The trains were built by Strømmens Værksted , Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri ( NEBB ) . The diesel series was assembled by Strømmen , while Skabo assembled the electric version . NEBB delivered the motors for the units . 
 During construction , which occurred during World War II , there were several modifications , delays and accidents during construction to avoid the trains being finished before the war ended ; this was to avoid the finished trains to be able to assist the German occupation forces . The first three units were finished in 1945 , and delivery was completed the following year . The class was originally numbered 106 , but NSB changed the numbering system in 1956 , and the class was renumbered to 66 . The units consisted of three cars , given the lettering BFM , B and BS . They were numbered 66 @.@ 01 – 04 , 66 @.@ 31 – 34 and 66 @.@ 61 – 64 , respectively ; this numbering system dates from 1970 . 
 = = Specifications = = 
 The trains had aluminum bodies , that were painted in the unusual colors of blue and yellow . Total weight for three cars was 102 @.@ 2 tonnes ( 100 @.@ 6 long tons ; 112 @.@ 7 short tons ) , of which the cars respectively weighed 46 @.@ 7 tonnes ( 46 @.@ 0 long tons ; 51 @.@ 5 short tons ) ( BFM ) , 28 @.@ 0 tonnes ( 27 @.@ 6 long tons ; 30 @.@ 9 short tons ) ( B ) and 27 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 27 @.@ 1 long tons ; 30 @.@ 3 short tons ) ( BS ) . Total length was 66 @.@ 1 meters ( 217 ft ) . The first car was the only one equipped with motors ; the four motors had a total power output of 353 kilowatts ( 473 hp ) . This allowed a maximum speed of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) , and it was the first train in Norway able to run at this speed . The trains were painted beige ( upper half ) and deep blue ( lower half ) , an until then unused color scheme in NSB . Only the Class 88 had a similar livery . 
 Seating was carried for 170 passengers — 46 , 70 and 54 respectively for each car . The motor car had a saloon section with ten seats ; however , this was converted to conventional seating in 1956 . It also had a 15 @-@ square @-@ meter ( 160 sq ft ) cargo section . The center and end cars each had two sections , and the latter had a 13 m2 ( 140 sq ft ) cargo area . However , 66 @.@ 64 instead had a restaurant with 23 seats . This was for when the trains were planned to be used on the Dovre Line . However , the line was not electrified until after the class had been removed from service . 
 = = Operation = = 
 Class 66 was put into service on the Østfold Line on 23 June 1946 . It reduced travel time to Halden to 1 hour and 53 minutes , and was branded as the Østfold Express . From 16 February to 8 September 1946 , it also had three weekly services that continued to Gothenburg , Sweden , as the Gothenburg Express . This was accomplished in 5 hours and 5 minutes . The high speed prohibited standing , and all passengers were required to purchase a seat reservation for NOK 4 . Three units were in operation at any given time , while the fourth was at service or in reserve . This proved to be too optimistic — during the 1950s , there were several periods were the trains were taken out of service due to lack of maintenance . During 1954 , Saturday trains were operated as double units . 
 On 9 June 1947 , the class was also taken into use from Oslo West Station ( Oslo V ) on the Vestfold Line , and along the Sørlandet Line to Kongsberg . From the 1 June 1949 , after the Sørlandet Line was electrified to Kristiansand , these services were shifted to the Sørlandet Express . On 15 November 1950 , one unit was involved in the Hjuksebø train disaster , and the end car needed to be fully rebuilt . From 1 December 1956 , when the whole Sørlandet Line to Stavanger was electrified , the service was extended and rebranded the Stavanger Express . To free up sufficient stock , the Østfold Express was discontinued on 14 November 1956 . The Sørlandet Express operated each day , while the Stavanger Express only operated three times a week . However , the Stavanger Express did not prove a success , featuring low passenger numbers , and the last train ran on 24 August 1958 . The trains remained in service on the Sørlandet Express until 27 May 1967 . 
 During the 1960s , the new El 13 locomotives were delivered , and locomotive @-@ hauled express trains replaced the multiple units . From 28 May 1967 , Class 66 was moved to serve the Vestfold Line . It operated in services to Skien until 3 June 1973 , after which it only served to Larvik . During the summer of 1975 , they could also be seen operating Oslo V – Nelaug , and during the fall of 1976 on Oslo V – Drammen . The units were taken out of service on 21 May 1977 . A single motor car , 66 @.@ 01 , has been preserved by the Norwegian Railway Museum , who has stationed it at Elverum Station . 
 = = Incidents = = 
 On 15 November 1950 , the Hjuksebø train disaster occurred , when a Class 66 train en route from Kristiansand to Oslo collided with freight cars that were running uncontrolled along the track between Hjuksebø and <unk> . The accident is among the most disastrous in Norwegian history , killing twelve people . 
 On 26 March 1957 , motor car 66 @.@ 03 and center car <unk> were damaged in a fire at Kristiansand . Both were retired due to the large damages . On 8 June 1969 , a unit derailed at between <unk> and <unk> , but was restored . Motor car 66 @.@ 02 was exposed to a fire on 4 June 1975 , and again on 28 December 1976 . After the latter incident , the car was retired . 
 = USS Oneota ( 1864 ) = 
 USS Oneota was a single @-@ turreted Canonicus @-@ class monitor built for the Union Navy during the American Civil War . Completed shortly after the end of the war , Oneota was laid up until sold to her builders in 1868 , and then resold to Peru . Renamed Manco Cápac , the ship participated in the defense of Arica during the War of the Pacific . When the town was taken by Chilean troops in 1880 , she was scuttled to prevent her capture . Her wreck was rediscovered in 1960 and it has been heavily looted . 
 = = Description and construction = = 
 The ship was 225 feet ( 68 @.@ 6 m ) long overall , had a beam of 43 feet 3 inches ( 13 @.@ 2 m ) and had a maximum draft of 13 feet 6 inches ( 4 @.@ 1 m ) . Oneota had a tonnage of 1 @,@ 034 tons burthen and displaced 2 @,@ 100 long tons ( 2 @,@ 100 t ) . Her crew consisted of 100 officers and enlisted men . 
 Oneota was powered by a two @-@ cylinder horizontal vibrating @-@ lever steam engine that drove one propeller using steam generated by two Stimers horizontal fire @-@ tube boilers . The 320 @-@ indicated @-@ horsepower ( 240 kW ) engine gave the ship a top speed of 8 knots ( 15 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 mph ) . She carried 140 – 150 long tons ( 140 – 150 t ) of coal . Oneota 's main armament consisted of two smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading , 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) Dahlgren guns mounted in a single gun turret . Each gun weighed approximately 43 @,@ 000 pounds ( 20 @,@ 000 kg ) . They could fire a 350 @-@ pound ( 158 @.@ 8 kg ) shell up to a range of 2 @,@ 100 yards ( 1 @,@ 900 m ) at an elevation of + 7 ° . 
 The exposed sides of the hull were protected by five layers of 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) wrought iron plates , backed by wood . The armor of the gun turret and the pilot house consisted of ten layers of one @-@ inch plates . The ship 's deck was protected by armor 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) thick . A 5 @-@ by @-@ 15 @-@ inch ( 130 by 380 mm ) soft iron band was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent shells and fragments from jamming the turret as had happened to earlier monitors during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863 . The base of the funnel was protected to a height of 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) by 8 inches ( 200 mm ) of armor . A " rifle screen " of 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ inch ( 13 mm ) armor 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) high was installed on the top of the turret to protect the crew against Confederate snipers based on a suggestion by Commander Tunis A. M. Craven , captain of her sister ship Tecumseh . 
 The contract for Oneota , the only Navy ship to be named after the Oneota Tribe of the Sioux Indians , was awarded to Alexander Swift & Company ; the ship was laid down in 1862 at their Cincinnati , Ohio shipyard . She was launched on 21 May 1864 and completed on 10 June 1865 . The ship 's construction was delayed by multiple changes ordered while she was being built — reflecting battle experience with earlier monitors . This included the rebuilding of the turrets and pilot houses to increase their armor thickness from 8 inches ( 203 mm ) to 10 inches and to replace the bolts that secured their armor plates together with rivets to prevent them from being knocked loose by the shock of impact from shells striking the turret . Other changes included deepening the hull by 18 inches ( 457 mm ) to increase the ship 's buoyancy , moving the position of the turret to balance the ship 's trim and replacing all of the ship 's deck armor . Completion of the ship was further delayed by the low depth of the Ohio River which prevented her movement from Cincinnati in December 1864 to finish fitting out . The river finally rose in March 1865 which allowed the ship to reach Mound City , Illinois on 7 March , where Oneota was placed in ordinary after completion , together with her sisters Catawba and Tippecanoe . 
 The ships needed a deep @-@ water berth and were moved opposite Cairo , Illinois in mid @-@ 1865 even though they still had to be anchored in the main channel where they were often struck by debris , drifting ice , and vulnerable to accidents . Tippecanoe 's anchor chain was broken on 27 March 1866 when she was struck by a steamboat towing barges and the monitor collided with Oneota and the two ships were dragged 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) downstream before they could be brought under control . This was a persistent problem and the Navy finally decided to move the ships down to New Orleans in May 1866 . In August 1867 , the Navy turned over Oneota and Catawba to Swift & Co. contingent on a guarantee that they would be returned in good shape if they could not be sold , and the company began refitting them for Peruvian service . 
 In October 1867 , an agent for Swift & Co. negotiated a deal with Peru to purchase Oneota and her sister for a million dollars apiece . Gideon Welles , Secretary of the Navy , initially indicated that the company could repurchase the two if it refunded the government 's costs to build them , but changed his mind and said that he had no authority to do that . Congress debated the issue and ultimately decided that they would be appraised by a board of officers and that the highest competitive bid in equal to or in excess of the appraised value would be accepted . The ship was appraised at $ 375 @,@ 000 and sold for that amount , possibly after a rigged bid , on 11 April 1868 . 
 = = BAP Manco Cápac = = 
 The monitor was renamed by the Peruvian Navy as Manco Cápac , after Manco Cápac , the legendary first king of the Kingdom of Cuzco which would grow into the Inca Empire . To prepare the ship for her lengthy voyage to Peru around Cape Horn , Swift & Co. added a breakwater on the bow , stepped two masts with a fore @-@ and @-@ aft rig to supplement her engine , and provided closures to make vents and deck openings water tight . 
 While this was going on , the United States was negotiating with Great Britain over compensation for losses inflicted by British ships knowingly sold to the Confederacy during the Civil War ( the Alabama Claims ) . Peru had been involved in an undeclared war with Spain ( the Chincha Islands War ) in 1864 – 66 and the US was not willing to prejudice its claims against the United Kingdom by performing a similar action for a belligerent power . Negotiations over the issue delayed the departure of the two monitors until January 1869 , after Peru bought two steamers , Reyes and Marañon to tow the monitors . They only reached Pensacola , Florida , before machinery breakdowns forced them to wait 30 days for repairs to be completed . En route from Key West to the Bahamas , the ships were separated in heavy weather . When Reyes attempted to reattach her <unk> after the storm moderated , she collided with the sharp bow of Manco Cápac and sank in 15 minutes . The monitor , short of coal and food , was forced to make port at Naranjo , Cuba , then held by rebels against the Spanish government . They allowed the ship to restock her supplies , but no coal was available so the crew loaded up enough wood to reach the Bahamas where they were able to send a local schooner to Nassau to inform the authorities of their plight . The ships finally reunited at St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands and had to wait for the <unk> to arrive from Peru to tow Manco Cápac . While entering Rio de Janeiro on the night of 15 September , Manco Cápac ran aground ; she was refloated the following day , but the damage required three months to repair . The ships were joined by the steam corvette Unión during this time . They reached the Strait of Magellan on 29 January 1870 and Callao on 11 May . 
 In 1879 , disagreements over guano and nitrate @-@ rich lands led Chile to start the War of the Pacific with Bolivia and Peru . The ex @-@ Peruvian turret ship <unk> , captured by the Chileans at the Battle of <unk> , attacked the Peruvians at Arica on 27 February 1880 , fighting an inconclusive duel with Manco Cápac . The Peruvian failed in her attempt to ram the Chilean ironclad , although the Huascar 's captain was killed in the engagement . The Chilean fleet continued to blockade Arica as the army closed in on the city from the rear . Manco Cápac hit the schooner <unk> on blockade duty on 6 June , but the monitor was scuttled to prevent her capture when the city fell the following day .

 The wreck was discovered in 1960 and is located 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) west of the mouth of the San José River at a depth of 15 @.@ 7 meters ( 51 ft 6 in ) .

 = Reid Blackburn = 
 Reid Turner Blackburn ( August 11 , 1952 – May 18 , 1980 ) was a photographer killed in the 1980 volcanic eruption of Mount St. Helens . A photojournalist covering the eruption for a local newspaper — the Vancouver , Washington Columbian — as well as National Geographic magazine and the United States Geological Survey , he was caught at Coldwater Camp in the blast . 
 Blackburn 's car and body were found four days after the eruption . His camera , buried under the debris of the eruption , was found roughly one week later . 
 After his death , Reid was praised by his coworkers and friends alike . They spoke of his talent and enthusiasm , as well as his sometimes " acerbic " sense of humor . His wife , Fay , concluded that he had died doing what he loved . 
 = = Life = = 
 Blackburn was born in 1952 , the son of an engineer who possessed " a fixation on figuring out the way things worked " . He loved the idea of photography , once equating it to " painting with light " . He was an accomplished photographer , and had received accolades from the Associated Press for his photographs . Blackburn also authored a book on outboard hydroplane racing . 
 Blackburn attended Linfield College in Oregon . He began working at The Columbian newspaper in 1975 as a photojournalist . It was there that he met his wife , Fay Mall , who worked in the newspaper 's display advertising department . The two dated for several months before marrying in the summer of 1979 . Blackburn enjoyed hiking and loved the outdoors . 
 = = Assignment at Mount St. Helens = = 
 According to coworker and photo editor Steve Small , St. Helens was Blackburn 's favorite mountain . They climbed it together several times , and referred to it as " the Sleeping Beauty of the Northwest . " 
 Blackburn first became interested in the possibility of an eruption at Mount St. Helens in March 1980 , when a series of earthquakes rocked the volcano . Having already climbed the mountain , he was intrigued by the situation and was eventually assigned to document the activity of the volcano for his outdoor skills and his meticulousness . By May , he had begun camping out at the volcano as a joint project to take pictures of the volcanic phenomena for The Columbian , National Geographic , and the United States Geological Survey . 
 Despite being assigned to stay on the mountain only until May 17 , Blackburn opted to stay a few more days . Blackburn was situated near Coldwater Creek , 8 miles ( 13 km ) from the volcano , on the day of the eruption . 
 Early on May 18 , an earthquake measuring 5 @.@ 1 on the Richter scale struck the region , creating a massive landslide — <unk> cubic miles ( 3 km3 ) of rock that released pressure on the volcano 's crater , causing an ejection of steam . Just seconds later , Mount St. Helens erupted laterally ( from its side ) , sending supersonic pyroclastic flows ( very hot clouds of gas and volcanic ash ) into the forest below . 
 = = Death = = 
 Blackburn was killed when a pyroclastic flow enveloped the area where he was camped out . His car was found four days later , surrounded up to the windows in ash with his body inside . The windows had been broken and ash filled the interior of the vehicle . 
 In early June , National Geographic photographer Fred Stocker recovered Blackburn 's camera from debris 2 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 m ) thick . The film was not salvageable , as the intense heat from the eruption had corrupted the negatives . 
 The 1980 event was the deadliest and most destructive volcanic eruption in the history of the United States . A total of 57 people are known to have died , and more were left homeless when the ash falls and pyroclastic flows destroyed or buried 200 houses . In addition to Blackburn , notable resident Harry Randall Truman and volcanologist David Alexander Johnston were killed . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 After his death , friends and coworkers of Blackburn came forward to compliment his pleasant character and his talent . Friends described Blackburn as having " an impishness his friends came to expect . " <unk> Mike Prager called Reid " one of the funniest and most talented journalists in the Pacific Northwest " who " made his job look easy , he was that good . " Tom <unk> , editor of The Columbian , described Blackburn 's humor as " wry " and sometimes " acerbic " , but elaborated that Blackburn was " gentle , displaying aggression when it was necessary for him to get close to a subject he was photographing . " Commenting on her husband 's dedication to photography , Fay Blackburn remarked , " if Reid were alive today , he 'd probably be back on the front line seeking to capture the latest chapter in the mountain 's evolution , in spite of the risk . " " Reid loved that mountain . He climbed it , hiked it , skied it . " She added that he died doing what he loved . 
 The National Press Photographers Association awards a competitive scholarship annually in Blackburn 's honor , worth $ 2000 . In 2005 The Columbian offered an internship to applicants for the scholarship in memory of Blackburn . 
 In December 2013 , a roll of undeveloped film containing pre @-@ eruption shots of Mount St. Helens was discovered in Blackburn 's archives at The Columbian . The photos , taken by Blackburn during a helicopter photo shoot of the mountain the month before the eruption , were successfully developed over 30 years after Blackburn 's death , and remain journalistically important as a record of the pre @-@ eruption landscape . 
 = William Calcraft = 
 William Calcraft ( 11 October 1800 – 13 December 1879 ) was a 19th @-@ century English hangman , one of the most prolific of British executioners . It is estimated in his 45 @-@ year career he carried out 450 executions . A cobbler by trade , Calcraft was initially recruited to flog juvenile offenders held in Newgate Prison . While selling meat pies on streets around the prison , Calcraft met the City of London 's hangman , John Foxton . 
 After Foxton 's death in 1829 the government appointed Calcraft the official Executioner for the City of London and Middlesex . Following this , his executioner services were in great demand throughout England . Nevertheless , some considered Calcraft incompetent , in particular for his controversial use of the short @-@ drop hanging method in which the condemned were slowly strangled to death . 
 Because with Calcraft 's methods the condemned took several minutes to die , to hasten death Calcraft would sometimes dramatically pull on legs or climb on shoulders in an effort to break a victim 's neck . It has been speculated that Calcraft used these methods partly to entertain the crowds , sometimes numbering 30 @,@ 000 spectators or more . 
 Executions in England were public until 1868 . That year the law changed , mandating executions would take place privately and inside the prison . In 1868 Calcraft carried out the last public and first private executions . Among his executions were Marie and Frederick Manning , the first husband and wife to be hanged together since 1700 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Calcraft was born in <unk> , near Chelmsford , in 1800 . He was a cobbler by trade , but had also worked as a nightwatchman at Reid 's brewery in Clerkenwell , London . While attempting to earn a living by selling meat pies on the streets around Newgate Prison he made the acquaintance of John Foxton , who was the City of London 's hangman for 40 years . That meeting led to his employment at Newgate to flog juvenile offenders , for which he was paid 10 shillings a week . 
 = = Career as an executioner , 1829 – 1874 = = 
 Foxton died on 14 February 1829 , and Calcraft was appointed as his successor . He was sworn in as the official Executioner for the City of London and Middlesex on 4 April 1829 , a position for which he was paid one guinea a week plus an additional guinea for each execution . He also received an allowance for cats o ' nine tails and birch rods , and supplemented his income by selling sections of the rope used to hang his victims , for which he charged between five shillings and £ 1 per inch . Calcraft 's first duty in his new role was the execution of Thomas Lister and George Wingfield , hanged together on 27 March 1829 , Lister for burglary and Wingfield for highway robbery . Esther Hibner , known in the press as the " Evil Monster " , was the first woman hanged by Calcraft . She was executed on 13 April 1829 , having been found guilty of starving to death her apprentice , Frances <unk> . Hibner did not go to the scaffold willingly , but had to be restrained in a straitjacket to prevent her from attacking her executioners . As she was hanged the watching crowd shouted out " Three cheers for the Hangman ! " 
 Calcraft was " in great demand " as an executioner elsewhere in the country as well , such as at Reading Gaol . During his tenure of office the Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868 was passed , requiring that all executions must be conducted in private . Calcraft carried out the last public execution in Britain on 26 May 1868 , when he hanged the Fenian Michael Barrett in front of Newgate Prison for his part in the Clerkenwell Outrage . Calcraft also carried out the first private execution in Britain under the new law . Eighteen @-@ year @-@ old Thomas Wells , who had been convicted of the murder of his superior Edward Walshe , the stationmaster at Dover Priory railway station , was hanged on 13 August 1868 in a former timber yard inside Maidstone Gaol . Members of the press were allowed to attend and reported that Wells , who wore his railway porter 's uniform , did not die quickly , " struggling on the end of the rope for several minutes " . Calcraft 's final official duty was the hanging of James Godwin , on 25 May 1874 . 
 Reporting on Calcraft 's visit to Dundee to perform an execution in that city in April 1873 , The Times newspaper observed that " if their visitor had been a Royal personage , or an eminent statesman he could hardly have been treated with greater consideration " . They further reported that Calcraft arrived with only one piece of hand luggage , a carpet bag containing " a new rope , a white cap , and some <unk> straps " . 
 The number of executions Calcraft carried out is unrecorded , but it has been estimated at 450 , of whom 35 were women , making him one of the most active of British executioners . Among his better @-@ known victims was François Courvoisier , executed on 6 July 1840 outside Newgate Prison . Courvoisier had been valet to Lord William Russell , and had murdered his master after being caught stealing silverware from the household . 
 Calcraft officiated at one of the very few executions of a husband and wife , and the first since 1700 , when he hanged Marie and Frederick Manning at <unk> Lane Gaol on 13 November 1849 . The couple had murdered Marie 's wealthy lover , Patrick O 'Connor , with the aim of stealing his money . Calcraft also officiated at the last public execution of a woman in Britain , Frances Kidder , who was hanged on 2 April 1868 . Convicted of drowning her stepdaughter , she was executed in front of a crowd of 2 @,@ 000 , amongst whom was reported to be her husband . After her drop of 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) she struggled for " two or three minutes " before expiring .

 Although Calcraft 's career as a hangman spanned 45 years , he appears to have been " particularly incompetent " , frequently having to " rush below the scaffold to pull on his victim 's legs to hasten death " . Those being hanged had their arms pinioned to their sides with leather straps before being walked to the gallows , where they were placed on a trapdoor and their heads and faces covered with a white cap , or hood . The purpose of the hood was to prevent the prisoner seeing the hangman pull the lever that released the trapdoor – and thus attempting to jump at the critical moment – and to hide from spectators any agony on the dying prisoner 's face . After the noose had been secured around each victim 's neck and the hangman had retired to a safe distance , the trapdoor was released . The bodies were left hanging for some time to ensure that death had occurred , before being lowered to the ground . Calcraft employed the short @-@ drop method of execution , in which the drop through the trapdoor might be around 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) or so . That was often insufficient to break the prisoner 's neck , and therefore death was not always instantaneous , typically occurring slowly by strangulation . Historians Anthony Stokes and Theodore Dalrymple have suggested that Calcraft 's " controversial " use of the short @-@ drop allowed him a couple of minutes to entertain the large crowds of 30 @,@ 000 plus that sometimes attended his public executions . " Renowned for his poor taste " , he would sometimes swing from his victim 's legs or climb onto their shoulders in an attempt to break their necks . In one of the first executions Calcraft carried out at the new Reading Gaol his victim , Thomas Jennings , took more than three minutes to die . 
 On 31 March 1856 , Calcraft executed William Bousfield , but a threat he had received that he would be shot on the scaffold unnerved him . After releasing the bolt securing the trapdoor on which the condemned man was standing , Calcraft ran off , leaving Bousfield hanging ; a few moments later Bousfield raised one of his legs to support himself on the platform . Calcraft 's assistant tried to push the victim off , but Bousfield repeatedly succeeded in supporting himself . The officiating chaplain forced the frightened Calcraft to return to the scaffold , where he " threw himself around his [ Bousfield 's ] legs and by the force of his weight finally succeeded in strangling him " . Calcraft 's bungling became the subject of a popular ballad . 
 Calcraft was also reportedly nervous of executing Fenians , because of threats he had received . On 22 November 1867 he officiated at the public execution of William Philip Allen , Michael Larkin , and Michael O 'Brien , who became known as the Manchester Martyrs . The three Fenians had been found guilty of the murder of a police officer , and were hanged together . Most accounts claim that Allen died almost instantaneously from a broken neck , but Larkin and O 'Brien were not so fortunate . A Catholic priest in attendance , Father Gadd , reported that : 
 The other two ropes , stretched taut and tense by their breathing twitching burdens , were in ominous and distracting movement . The hangman had bungled ! ... Calcraft then descended into the pit and there finished what he could not accomplish from above . He killed Larkin . 
 Father Gadd refused to allow Calcraft to dispatch O 'Brien in the same way , and so " for three @-@ quarters of an hour the good priest [ Father Gadd ] knelt , holding the dying man 's hands within his own , reciting the prayers for the dying . Then the long drawn out agony ended . " 
 Towards the end of his career the feeling began to be expressed in the press that Calcraft 's age was catching up with him . On 15 November 1869 , aged 69 , Calcraft executed Joseph Welsh , for murder , at Maidstone Gaol . Reporting on the execution The Times commented that " the adjustment of the rope was slow and bungling , and such as to show that Calcraft 's age has unfitted him for his occupation " . 
 = = Later life = = 
 By 1869 Calcraft 's mother , Sarah , was living as a pauper in a workhouse at Hatfield Peverel near Chelmsford . Calcraft was ordered to pay 3 shillings a week towards her upkeep , to which he objected , arguing that his brother and sister should be made to help , and that he had three children of his own to support , although there is no record of his marriage . 
 After reluctantly being forced to retire from office because of old age in 1874 , Calcraft received a pension of 25 shillings a week from the City of London and was succeeded as hangman by William Marwood . Although as a younger man Calcraft had been considered to be " genial " , with a love of breeding rabbits , in his later years he was described as " surly and sinister @-@ looking , with long hair and beard , in scruffy black attire and a fob chain " . 
 Calcraft died at Poole Street in Hoxton , on 13 December 1879 . An obituary published in The New York Times on 1 January 1880 reported that " Several so @-@ called biographies of Calcraft were published during his lifetime , but all are notable for a narrow stream of fact meandering through a broad meadow of commentary , and not one may be considered worthy of the subject or to be relied on for a strict accuracy of statement " . The earliest of them was an octavo pamphlet published in 1846 entitled The <unk> of the Gallows ; or ; The Past and Present Life of William Calcraft , the Living Hangman of Newgate .

 = = High school career = = 
 Davis is from the South Side of Chicago and played high school basketball for Perspectives Charter School , where he had attended school since sixth grade . The team plays in a division of the Chicago Public High School League , known as the Blue Division , that is ignored by the media because of its lower level of competition . Perspectives is a charter school that operates as a math and science academy with high academic pedigree , but minimal athletic success . The school had no gymnasium and Davis ' middle school basketball teams practiced at a nearby church . In junior high school , he was known as " the little guy who would shoot threes from the corner " . He ended his freshman year at a height of 6 feet 0 inches ( 1 @.@ 83 m ) . By the beginning of his sophomore year , he had grown another 1 inch ( 2 @.@ 5 cm ) , and he finished the year at 6 feet 4 inches ( 1 @.@ 93 m ) . 
 As an unheralded guard after his sophomore season , he worked out with his cousins on guard drills that their father ( Davis ' uncle ) had developed . Davis did not play in the spring / summer AAU circuit between 8th grade and his junior year . He began his junior year at a height of 6 feet 7 inches ( 2 @.@ 01 m ) and his junior basketball season at 6 feet 8 inches ( 2 @.@ 03 m ) , saying he felt fortunate to have had such a rapid growth spurt without any knee pains . During his junior year , his family considered having him transfer to one of Chicago 's basketball powerhouses , but Hyde Park Career Academy head coach Donnie Kirksey , who knew Davis , Sr. well , advised against it saying " If you 're good enough , they 'll find you wherever you are . " Perspectives finished the season 8 – 15 . Although he remained unnoticed nationally and locally after three seasons of Chicago Public League play , he was soon thereafter rated as the # 1 player in the class of 2011 by Scout.com and in the ESPNU 100 . Rivals.com rated him the # 2 player behind Austin Rivers . The attention came when he started playing on Tai Streets ' <unk> ( AAU team ) traveling system in the spring of his junior year . As late as Spring 2010 he was still unknown , but began to be noticed in mid April . In late April , Syracuse offered him a scholarship . That spring NBA Top 100 Camp Director Dave <unk> , invited him to the camp based on his dominant first half performance of the first game of the Fort Wayne , Indiana <unk> Fieldhouse event . That summer his talent was attention @-@ grabbing . In August 2010 , Davis played in the Nike Global Challenge in Hillsboro , Oregon . In the opening game , he had 23 points and 9 rebounds . 
 Davis verbally committed to Kentucky on August 13 , 2010 , choosing it over his other finalists , which were DePaul , Ohio State , and Syracuse . He had officially visited DePaul and Ohio State . On August 24 , 2010 , he became the number one rated player in the national class of 2011 at Scout.com. The pay @-@ for @-@ play scandal had played out very publicly in the press . Before Davis committed to Kentucky , the Chicago Sun @-@ Times reported that his father , Anthony Davis , Sr. asked Kentucky for $ 200 @,@ 000 for a commitment from his son . The report was initially released on Wednesday August 4 , 2010 by Sun @-@ Times reporter Michael O 'Brien . Citing " a reliable source , " he posted the following text " rumors / sources that have Davis choosing Kentucky are also alleging that the commitment cost $ 200 @,@ 000 . " before it was edited to say " rumors that Davis ' commitment is for sale have surfaced since he cut his list of schools down about a month ago . " and then removed later that day from the Sun @-@ Times ' high school sports website following a threat from a University of Kentucky lawyer . A Lexington , Kentucky law firm sent a letter under the signature of attorney Stephen L. Barker that expressed a " formal demand that you ( O 'Brien and the Sun @-@ Times ) withdraw the publication from any source from which it has been published , and issue an immediate statement that you know of no credible evidence indicating that there is any truth to the ' rumors ' referred to in your article . " Baker 's letter also threatened potential " punitive damages for your malicious and willful actions . " Anthony Davis Sr. declined to speak to the Chicago Tribune on August 4 regarding the allegation , although he denied the allegations to the Sun @-@ Times stating " We haven 't asked anyone for anything , and no one has offered us anything , " on July 30 before the story broke . 
 The article was reposted on the Sun @-@ Times ' website and included in the print edition on Friday August 6 where O 'Brien wrote " sources from three separate universities told the Sun @-@ Times that Davis Sr. asked for money in return for his son 's commitment , with the amounts ranging from $ 125 @,@ 000 to $ 150 @,@ 000 . " The University of Kentucky and the Davis family both threatened to sue the Sun @-@ Times over the article , however , no lawsuits were filed by Kentucky or the Davis family . The Davises and Kentucky claim the restated publication was false . Illinois ' one @-@ year statute of limitations on libel cases expired before any lawsuits were filed . 
 Davis signed his National Letter of Intent on November 10 , 2010 . He began his senior season on the Chicago Sun @-@ Times area 2010 Top 50 list . He was a pre @-@ season first team all @-@ state selection by the Sun @-@ Times along with Ryan Boatright ( East Aurora / Connecticut ) , Wayne Blackshear ( Morgan Park / Louisville ) , <unk> Henry ( Orr / Illinois ) , and Jabari Parker ( Simeon / Duke ) . By that time , he stood at 6 feet 10 inches ( 2 @.@ 08 m ) . According to Rodger Bohn of SLAM Magazine who saw him play more than 10 times , Davis retained his guard instincts after his growth spurt . Despite Davis ' individual prowess , Perspectives began the season with a 0 – 6 record . He sat out one of those games with minor forearm and leg injuries . It took a near quadruple double on December 15 , 2010 against Benito Juarez Community Academy , when he posted 32 points , 21 rebounds , 11 assists and 9 blocked shots for the team to earn its first victory in its seventh game . The team 's subsequent game against Whitney M. Young Magnet High School played at Chicago State University was nationally televised on ESPNU . Later in the season , he missed some games due to a sprained right thumb . Despite losing approximately three @-@ quarters of its regular season games , Perspective earned a Class 3A regional play @-@ in game victory against Noble Street Charter High School in the Illinois High School Association state playoffs when Davis totaled 33 points , 9 rebounds , 7 assists , 5 blocked shots and 4 steals . However , after losing the subsequent regional semifinal game to King College Prep High School the team finished with a 6 – 19 record . Despite his growth , he continued to perform much of the role of a guard by bringing the ball up the court and shooting outside shots . For the season , he averaged 32 points , 22 rebounds and 7 blocks . 
 In high school , Davis earned numerous honors for his basketball abilities including being named to the 2011 McDonald 's All @-@ American Game and the 10th annual Jordan Brand Classic . Although he had not been rated in the Mr. Basketball USA poll to end the 2009 – 10 season , he began the 2010 – 11 season ranked fifth , which was the highest of previously unranked players and finished the season fourth behind Rivers , Mike Gilchrist ( now known as Michael Kidd @-@ Gilchrist ) and Bradley Beal .

However , in the statewide voting for the Illinois Mr. Basketball by coaches and media , he only placed fourth behind co @-@ winners Boatright and Chasson Randle ( Rock Island / Stanford ) and third @-@ place finisher Blackshear .

 Davis committed to the Kentucky Wildcats , coached by John Calipari . Before his college career began , he was being mentioned as the NBA draft first overall selection in the 2012 NBA draft . In late February Dick Vitale mentioned the possibility that Davis might complete the men 's college basketball awards Grand Slam of National Player of the Year , Defensive Player of the Year , Freshman of the Year and the No. 1 overall pick in the upcoming draft . " During the exhibition portion of the season for the 2011 – 12 Wildcats , Calipari described Davis as follows : " He 's 6 – 10 with a 7 – 3 wingspan and he can shoot the 3 and dribble the ball and lead the break . . . " Less than a month into the season , ESPN 's Andy Katz described him similarly : " Davis offers a multitude of skills for the Wildcats with his ability to block shots , run the floor , score in the low post and face up to the basket . " Since Calipari had coached Marcus Camby , who was also a tall shot @-@ blocker , Davis drew comparisons to Camby . ESPN selected Davis as a preseason All @-@ American along with teammate Terrence Jones .

 On May 2 , 2012 , following a rash of injuries to players who had been on the 20 @-@ man Team USA basketball roster in January ( notably center Dwight Howard ) , Davis was named as one of the finalists for the 2012 Olympic basketball team . Davis , along with Greg Monroe , was under consideration to fill the vacancy at center resulting from Howard 's injury . Davis would be the first American player since Emeka Okafor ( 2004 ) to have competed in the Olympics without any prior NBA experience . By the beginning of July , he was one of six players ( along with Blake Griffin , James Harden , Rudy Gay , Andre Iguodala and Eric Gordon ) competing for the final three roster spots , according to USA Basketball director Jerry Colangelo . Tyson Chandler , Kevin Love , Griffin and Davis were the only true post players among the final 15 . It was reported that Davis " suffered a severely sprained ankle in a workout " on June 30 and " almost assuredly [ would ] bypass a chance to play for Team USA [ that ] summer in the London Olympics . " On July 12 , 2012 , however , he was selected for the 2012 USA men 's basketball roster after Blake Griffin suffered an injury to the same knee he injured in the 2012 NBA Playoffs . That team went undefeated in the 2012 Olympic tournament in London and won the gold medal match over Spain . 
 Davis was also a member of the 2014 national team that won the gold medal in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup over Serbia on September 14 .

 Bassem al @-@ Tamimi ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> , born c . 1967 ) is a Palestinian activist and an organizer of protests against Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank . He was convicted by an Israeli military court in 2011 for " sending people to throw stones , and holding a march without a permit " . Tamimi 's lawyers denied those charges saying “ He believes in passive resistance and says he never asked anyone to throw stones ” . 
 al @-@ Tamimi organizes weekly demonstrations against Israeli settlement . He has been arrested by the Israeli authorities over a dozen times , at one point spending more than three years in administrative detention without trial . Al @-@ Tamimi advocates grassroots , nonviolent resistance , but has stated his belief that stone @-@ throwing is an important symbol of Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation . His 2011 arrest drew international attention , with the European Union describing him as a " human rights defender " and Amnesty International designating him a prisoner of conscience . He was arrested again in October 2012 for a demonstration in a supermarket , but released in early 2013 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Al @-@ Tamimi was ten weeks old at the time of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in June 1967 and hid with his mother in a cave during the conflict . As a grassroots activist , he organized weekly demonstrations to protest the seizure of the village 's well by the nearby Israeli settlement of Halamish , established in 1977 . The protests regularly lead to violent clashes , with Palestinian youths throwing stones and Israeli forces firing on protesters with tear gas , rubber bullets , and water cannons . Since the end of 2009 , 64 people ( 13 % of the village 's population ) has been arrested . 
 Prior to his 2011 arrest , al @-@ Tamimi had been arrested by Israeli authorities eleven times , at one point spending more than three years in administrative detention without trial . In 1993 , he lost consciousness for eight days after being shaken during an interrogation , and required surgery for removal of a subdural haematoma . His home has also been designated for demolition by Israel 's Civil Administration . 
 Al @-@ Tamimi is an admirer of Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi and believes that armed conflict against a more powerful Israeli opponent will only bring disaster . Al @-@ Tamimi states that he advocates nonviolent resistance , telling a reporter in 2011 , " Our strategic choice of a popular struggle — as a means to fight the occupation taking over our lands , lives and future — is a declaration that we do not harm human lives . The very essence of our activity opposes killing . " However , he has stated he is not concerned as to whether stone @-@ throwing is a form of violence , but views it instead as a symbol of Palestinian resistance : " We see our stones as our message . "

 On 24 March 2011 al @-@ Tamimi was detained by Israeli forces following a demonstration . Following his arrest , he was charged with sending youths to throw stones , holding a march without a permit , incitement , and perverting the course of justice . He was subsequently held in a military prison for thirteen months . Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience , " detained solely for his role in organizing peaceful protests against the encroachment onto Palestinian lands by Israeli settlers , " and called for his immediate and unconditional release . 
 On 27 April 2012 al @-@ Tamimi was released on 12 @,@ 000 shekels ( US $ 3 @,@ 193 ) bail due to a stroke suffered by his mother two weeks previous .

" 
 Al @-@ Tamimi , during his trial , repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of the Israeli military court trying him as well as Israeli regulations regarding public gatherings . The military judge ultimately found him guilty of sending stone @-@ throwers and illegal protesting but cleared him of the two more serious charges . She stated that testimony from a 14 @-@ year @-@ old witness had been inconsistent and therefore unusable and that she had found misrepresentations by interrogators about the content of the confession of another witness . Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak described al @-@ Tamimi 's partial exoneration as a " miracle " given the 99 @.@ 74 percent conviction rate of the military court . Before his sentencing al @-@ Tamimi stated that " the laws come from an occupying regime whose legitimacy I do not recognise . I don 't think even for a single minute that there is going to be justice done . " His lawyer denied al @-@ Tamimi 's involvement in stone throwing , stating that al @-@ Tamimi believed in passive resistance . 
 On 29 May , al @-@ Tamimi was sentenced to time served of thirteen months ' imprisonment , and an additional two suspended sentences . A military spokeswoman stated that the sentence had been suspended due to " irregularities in the trial " and al @-@ Tamimi 's " clean prison record " . Under the terms of al @-@ Tamimi 's suspended sentences , he would be imprisoned for two months if he participated in an illegal demonstration within two years of the sentencing , and imprisoned for seven months if he participated in " activity against the security forces " within five years . Responding to the suspended sentences , al @-@ Tamimi said , " I feel that my whole life is under the surveillance of the judge . " 
 Catherine Ashton , the European Union High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy , expressed the EU 's concern over the conviction and called on Israel to allow peaceful protests . She also condemned the interrogation of a minor without a lawyer in the investigation as a " violation of his rights . " Human Rights Watch stated that the conviction " violates [ al @-@ Tamimi 's ] right to freedom of assembly , while [ the court 's ] conviction of him on a second charge of urging children to throw stones on the basis of a child ’ s <unk> @-@ obtained statement raises serious concerns about the fairness of his trial .

 = HIV / AIDS in Malawi = 
 As of 2012 , approximately 1 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 people in Malawi are HIV @-@ positive , which represents 10 @.@ 8 % of the country 's population . Because the Malawian government was initially slow to respond to the epidemic under the leadership of Hastings Banda ( 1966 @-@ 1994 ) , the prevalence of HIV / AIDS increased drastically between 1985 , when the disease was first identified in Malawi , and 1993 , when HIV prevalence rates were estimated to be as high as 30 % among pregnant women . The Malawian food crisis in 2002 resulted , at least in part , from a loss of agricultural productivity due to the prevalence of HIV / AIDS . Various degrees of government involvement under the leadership of Bakili Muluzi ( 1994 @-@ 2004 ) and Bingu wa Mutharika ( 2004 @-@ 2012 ) resulted in a gradual decline in HIV prevalence , and , in 2003 , many people living in Malawi gained access to antiretroviral therapy . Condoms have become more widely available to the public through non @-@ governmental organizations , and more Malawians are taking advantage of HIV testing services . 
 Due to several successful television and radio campaigns by the Malawian government and non @-@ governmental organizations in Malawi , levels of awareness regarding HIV / AIDS are high among the general population . However , many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes in response to the epidemic , convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable ; on the other hand , some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection . Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV , women are more likely to be HIV @-@ positive than men in Malawi . The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners , who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease . In addition , many teachers exclude HIV / AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue , and , therefore , many children are not exposed to information about HIV / AIDS at school . Finally , the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi , leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation . 
 = = History = = 
 The first case of HIV / AIDS in Malawi was reported at Lilongwe 's <unk> Central Hospital in 1985 . President Hastings Banda , who was in power at the time , responded with several small @-@ scale prevention initiatives and created the National AIDS Control Programme , a division of the Ministry of Health , to manage the growing epidemic . Banda believed that issues relating to sex , including HIV transmission , should not be addressed in the public sphere ; during this time , it was illegal for Malawian citizens to discuss the epidemic openly . In 1989 , Banda introduced a five @-@ year World Bank Medium Term Plan to combat the epidemic , but HIV prevalence had already increased drastically at this point . 
 In 1994 , when Bakili Muluzi became president , he addressed the nation 's need for a coordinated response to the HIV / AIDS epidemic . In 2000 , Muluzi introduced another five @-@ year policy known as the National Strategic Framework , but , like Banda 's five @-@ year World Bank Medium Term Plan , this plan was largely ineffective . In 2001 , in response to problems within the National AIDS Control Programme established by Banda , Muluzi created the National AIDS Commission . Unlike Banda , who prevented the public from accessing information about the epidemic , Muluzi ensured that information about HIV / AIDS was available on the radio and television , in newspapers , and on billboards . However , despite Muluzi 's efforts , HIV prevalence was already significantly influencing national agricultural productivity during this period , and Malawi experienced an AIDS @-@ related nationwide famine in 2002 . 
 Malawians gained access to antiretroviral drugs in 2003 , and , with a donation from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria and the election of new President Bingu wa Mutharika in 2004 , government interventions increased substantially . However , soon after his election , Mutharika experienced tensions with Muluzi after implementing an anti @-@ corruption program , which distracted the government from addressing the nation 's food and HIV / AIDS @-@ related crises . Despite these obstacles , Mutharika successfully developed a National AIDS Policy and appointed a Principal Secretary for HIV / AIDS during his presidency . 
 = = Awareness and risk perception = = 
 Despite Malawi 's limited health and educational infrastructure , knowledge regarding HIV / AIDS is high among many people living in both urban and rural Malawi . According to a 2004 study by Barden @-@ O 'Fallon et al. involving 100 households , women in Malawi are most likely to learn about HIV / AIDS through radio and television , health workers at local clinics , and female members of their social networks . Men are also likely to access information about HIV / AIDS through radio and television ; however , unlike women , they are not likely to gain information about HIV / AIDS from their male friends . When 57 Malawian men were interviewed in 2003 , 100 % of them said they had heard about the HIV / AIDS epidemic on the radio , and 84 @.@ 2 % of them said they had learned about HIV / AIDS during their visits to local health facilities ; this supports the fact that many people in Malawi have access to information about the epidemic , both through the radio and other sources . 
 Personal traits such as age , gender , location , and education correlate , either positively or negatively , with HIV / AIDS awareness levels . For example , older women have demonstrated higher levels of knowledge regarding HIV / AIDS than younger women in Malawi . Because men typically have greater access to education and other social resources , they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women . While men are , on average , able to list 2 @.@ 2 ways to prevent HIV transmission , women are only able to list 1 @.@ 5 ways . Only 38 % of women surveyed in 2003 @-@ 2004 understood that their husbands would be less likely to contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high @-@ risk groups . In addition , men who are raised in urban environments are , on average , more informed about HIV / AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments , presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children . Among both men and women , higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV / AIDS : men and women who have received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease , such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV @-@ positive , than those who have not . Finally , people who have lost friends or family members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV / AIDS due to their personal , firsthand exposure to the problem . 
 The aforementioned study by Barden @-@ O 'Fallon et al . , which surveyed 940 women and 661 men , indicated that , despite their knowledge and awareness , many people in Malawi do not feel personally susceptible to HIV infection . On average , only 23 % of the adults who were surveyed during this study , both male and female , believed that they were likely to contract HIV and die of AIDS . Greater HIV / AIDS awareness among men does not seem to correspond with increased perceived risk ; on the other hand , increased levels of knowledge about HIV / AIDS do correlate positively to perceived risk among women . Another study conducted in rural Malawi between 1998 and 2001 by Kirsten P. Smith et al. indicated that concerns about personal vulnerability to HIV / AIDS declined during this four @-@ year time frame , probably because the increased use of preventative strategies gave people a sense of control . In fact , many participants in this study claimed that they were " not at all worried " about HIV / AIDS ; unless they had simply adopted a fatalistic standpoint towards the epidemic , these respondents probably felt that they had successfully reduced their risk of exposure through personal behavioral changes . 
 = = Education = = 
 Students in Malawi have expressed high levels of dissatisfaction regarding the HIV / AIDS @-@ related education and support they receive at school . According to a survey of students in Malawi , most secondary students do not believe that the HIV / AIDS curricula at their schools provide them with an adequate understanding of the disease . Although the Malawian government and non @-@ governmental organizations have conducted many campaigns to improve awareness about HIV / AIDS in schools , there is still a significant shortage of age @-@ appropriate audio and visual educational materials relating to HIV / AIDS available to instructors , particularly in rural areas . In addition , most teachers cannot identify the students in their classes who have been personally affected by the epidemic , either through friends or relatives , which suggests that school @-@ based support for HIV / AIDS is minimal . However , despite this lack of support , surveys indicate that children who have been affected by the epidemic do not usually experience HIV / AIDS @-@ based discrimination at school . 
 Most teachers are required to address HIV / AIDS in their curricula ; although instructors are , for the most part , committed to helping their students understand and avoid the disease , they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing their students about HIV / AIDS in productive ways . For example , some teachers cannot advise their students to remain faithful to their sexual partners without seeming hypocritical because they engage in extramarital sexual relations themselves . Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students , and some believe that , due to their limited training , they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV / AIDS to direct classroom discussions about the disease . In addition , many teachers feel unsupported by community members , who often either deny the extent of the epidemic or believe that HIV / AIDS should not be addressed in the classroom . 
 = = Affected groups = = 
 Although the HIV / AIDS epidemic has affected men , women , and children in Malawi , certain factors such as sexual orientation , gender , and age influence infection patterns . In Malawi , HIV / AIDS is usually transmitted through heterosexual sex , but the epidemic has also significantly impacted the homosexual male population in Malawi . In addition , women in Malawi are more likely to be HIV @-@ positive than men , suggesting that women are particularly vulnerable to HIV / AIDS . Finally , the disease has affected children and young adults both directly and indirectly ; 170 @,@ 000 Malawian children were HIV @-@ positive in 2011 , and the number of orphans in Malawi has increased dramatically since the epidemic began in 1985 . 
 = = = Men = = = 
 Due to the vast scope of the HIV / AIDS epidemic , many Malawian men believe that HIV contraction and death from AIDS are inevitable . Older men in particular often claim that the HIV / AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces . Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is inevitable . These men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural ( and therefore necessary and good ) when justifying their lack of condom use during sex with extramarital partners . Finally , some men identify as HIV @-@ positive without having undergone testing for HIV , preferring to believe that they have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as condom use or strict fidelity . Because of these fatalistic beliefs , many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV / AIDS in Malawi . 
 However , despite these widespread feelings of fatalism , some men believe that they can avoid HIV contraction by modifying their personal behaviors . Men who decide to change their behaviors to reduce their risk of infection are unlikely to use condoms consistently , particularly during marital intercourse ; instead , they usually continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations , but alter the ways in which they choose their sexual partners . For example , before selecting extramarital sexual partners , men sometimes survey their peers to determine whether their potential partners are likely to have exposed themselves to the virus . Men who choose their sexual partners based on external appearances and peer recommendations often believe that women who violate traditional gender norms by , for example , wearing modern clothing are more likely to carry HIV , while young girls , who are perceived as sexually inexperienced , are considered " pure . " Because of this perception , many people are concerned that schoolchildren in Malawi , particularly girls , are becoming exposed to the virus through sexual harassment or abuse by their instructors . 
 = = = Women = = = 
 According to traditional gender roles in Malawi , men operate primarily in the formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor , whereas women , who are valued for their domestic skills , are responsible for agricultural labor and care work ; this gender @-@ based division of labor decreases women 's autonomy , thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV / AIDS . Even within the home , women often lack bargaining power because they have limited access to education , formal employment , and other resources that could give them a sense of financial and personal independence . Women who are able to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men , even when they are completing the same tasks , making it difficult for them to elevate their status . 
 Many women are convinced that their husbands are putting their lives at risk by engaging in extramarital sexual relations without using protection ; however , because of their secondary status , they are often unwilling to initiate discussions about HIV / AIDS in the home . Most women in Malawi do not view divorce as a viable option , even when their husbands are HIV @-@ positive and refuse to protect them from the virus by wearing condoms during marital intercourse . Because they lack the education and training needed to seek gainful employment , women are not usually able to support themselves and their children outside of marriage without resorting to commercial sex work for money . 
 However , despite their vulnerability , some women in rural Malawi believe that they do , to a certain extent , have control over their own health and well @-@ being . They tell their husbands that the HIV / AIDS epidemic has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact . In addition , many women are convinced that , by appealing to the vulnerability of their children ( who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract HIV ) , they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters . Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands ' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk . Finally , as a last resort , women might warn their husbands that they will visit the <unk> , or traditional marriage counselor , and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease . 
 = = = Children = = = 
 The number of orphaned children in Malawi has increased dramatically since the HIV / AIDS epidemic began in 1985 , with certain surveys indicating that more than 35 % of schoolchildren have experienced the death of at least one parent due to HIV / AIDS . Because HIV is transmitted sexually , married couples who engage in unprotected sexual relations put their children at increased risk of becoming double orphans , or children who have lost both parents to HIV / AIDS . Older children who have lost both parents to HIV / AIDS often become responsible for the care of their younger siblings , and many double orphans drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try to support themselves and their siblings . Girls who have been orphaned by HIV / AIDS have unusually high rates of school absenteeism in Malawi . 
 When parents die of HIV / AIDS , extended family members usually become the children 's primary caregivers : in Malawi , 44 % of double orphans are adopted by grandparents or other close relatives . Extended family members often provide crucial support to HIV / AIDS orphans ; however , some sources indicate that extended family members mistreat orphans whose parents have died from HIV / AIDS . For example , family members who are unable to support adopted children often arrange early marriages for female orphans , who may then become victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse . 
 Evidence suggests that schoolchildren in Malawi are at risk of being exposed to HIV by their teachers , who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus . Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex ; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities , they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation . Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault , as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented . Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse , children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing , and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations . 
 = = Marriage and relationships = = 
 Although couples are starting to use condoms during extramarital intercourse more frequently , condom use during marital sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians ; in 2000 , only 2 @.@ 3 % of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with their spouses . Some people believe that condoms are only necessary during sex with high @-@ risk partners such as sex workers , and that condom use during marital sex implies infidelity . Others believe that marital condom use violates the religious purposes of marriage : sexual pleasure and reproduction . In a study published in 2007 by Agnes M. <unk> , men claimed that they use condoms with their wives for the sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies ; on the other hand , they were more concerned about sexually transmitted infections when discussing condom use with extramarital sexual partners . 
 Many different sources of information can motivate discussion about HIV / AIDS among married couples . After hearing information about HIV / AIDS at local health facilities or during conversations with friends or family members , people are more likely to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses . In addition , women are more likely than men to mention the dangers of HIV / AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations . According to a 2003 study by Eliya <unk> Zulu and Gloria <unk> , although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV / AIDS , education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV @-@ related prevention strategies . 
 = = Economic impact = = 
 A 2002 study conducted by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV / AIDS has affected economic well @-@ being in rural Malawi . When skilled laborers are infected with HIV , they are usually unable to work ; therefore , they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor @-@ intensive crops , sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable , labor @-@ intensive crops such as tobacco . When family members fall ill with HIV / AIDS , their relatives invest time in their treatment and care , further reducing household productivity . In addition , when family members are infected with HIV , households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses , further decreasing economic stability at the household level . Finally , when adults contract HIV , their children often remain home from school to work in the fields , threatening long @-@ term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi . 
 CARE International proposes several strategies that might reduce the destructive economic impact of HIV / AIDS on rural households . They recommend introducing new technologies that improve productivity to allow households affected by HIV / AIDS to continue supporting themselves through agriculture . Women in patrilineal / <unk> villages are often unable to support themselves and their children when their husbands die of HIV / AIDS ; therefore , helping women acquire traditionally masculine agricultural skills might decrease their vulnerability while improving agricultural productivity at the household and community levels . CARE International recommends increasing cooperation at the community level by establishing labor and food banks in areas that have been devastated by the HIV / AIDS epidemic . Finally , CARE International highlights the importance of increasing access to information about HIV / AIDS in Malawi to help families prepare for and cope with the economic burdens associated with the epidemic . 
 = = Impact on health services = = 
 The HIV / AIDS epidemic in Malawi has been characterized by drastic declines in the number of health workers available to provide treatment and care and increasing strain on health services : more than half of all hospital admissions in Malawi are related to HIV / AIDS . However , Malawi currently faces a significant deficit in human resources : only 159 doctors were practicing in Malawi in 2007 . The World Health Organization 's Essential Health Package recommends placing at least three health workers at every health facility in the country , but the vast majority of Malawi 's health facilities fail to meet this standard . 
 While migration to more developed countries in search of better opportunities , also known as " brain drain , " is partially responsible for the shortage of health care workers in Malawi , many health care workers have been personally affected by the HIV / AIDS epidemic ; in fact , an average of 48 nurses die of HIV / AIDS in Malawi every year . The HIV / AIDS epidemic has resulted in high levels of absenteeism among health workers in Malawi , who often leave work to spend time with HIV @-@ positive friends or relatives , and the Malawian government has failed to respond to the declining number of full @-@ time employees working in the health sector . Health workers who are not chronically absent frequently abandon their jobs because they are unable to cope with the heavy patient loads or because they are afraid that working in a medical environment will increase their risk of becoming infected with HIV . 
 Malawi has adopted task shifting strategies to overcome the shortage of workers available for HIV / AIDS treatment and care . Task shifting , which has been successful in many other regions , involves training less specialized health workers to perform health @-@ related tasks that do not require professional training , such as the initiation of antiretroviral therapy . For example , at <unk> District Hospital , health workers spend one week learning how to initiate antiretroviral therapy in a classroom setting and an additional two weeks practicing their knowledge in a supervised clinical setting ; after completing this course , they are legally ( under Ministry of Health guidelines ) allowed to initiate antiretroviral therapy . Another form of task shifting involves training health @-@ oriented counselors in HIV testing and counseling , which relieves nurses of this additional task . 
 = = Interventions = = 
 Malawi has taken many steps towards slowing the spread of HIV / AIDS , such as increasing access to condoms and improving testing services and treatment options . Many of these efforts have been funded by international donors including the World Bank , the Global Fund , the World Health Organization , the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) , and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS ( UNAIDS ) . The World Bank has lent $ 407 @.@ 9 million to Malawi , the Global Fund has agreed to give $ 390 million , and PEPFAR has donated $ 25 million for prevention and treatment campaigns . 
 = = = <unk> therapy = = = 
 The number of people using antiretroviral therapy in Malawi has increased dramatically in the past decade : between 2004 and 2011 , an estimated 300 @,@ 000 people gained access to antiretroviral treatment . In addition to improving access to antiretroviral therapy , in 2008 , Malawi introduced the World Health Organization 's treatment guidelines for antiretroviral therapy , which improved the quality of treatment available to Malawians . However , Malawi 's proposal for a new antiretroviral treatment plan in 2011 , which would have cost $ 105 million per year , was rejected by the Global Fund , threatening Malawi 's ability to continue expanding access to antiretroviral treatment . 
 In 2000 , Malawi 's Ministry of Health and Population began developing a plan to distribute antiretroviral drugs to the population , and , as of 2003 , there were several sites providing antiretroviral drugs in Malawi . The Lighthouse , a trust in Lilongwe that fights HIV / AIDS , provides antiretroviral drugs at a cost of 2 @,@ 500 <unk> per month . Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre provides antiretroviral therapy through its outpatient department , and Médecins Sans Frontières distributes antiretroviral drugs to patients for free in the <unk> and <unk> Districts . Many different private providers sell antiretroviral drugs , particularly in cities ; however , very few patients can afford to receive drugs from the private sector in Malawi . In addition , private providers are not currently required to obtain certification before selling antiretroviral drugs , and , therefore , this practice is not closely monitored . Finally , some employees receive access to antiretroviral drugs through the health insurance policies provided by their employers , but this practice is not widespread . 
 Due to the advent of antiretroviral drugs , HIV / AIDS has become a manageable disease for people who can access and afford treatment ; however , antiretroviral therapy remains largely unaffordable and inaccessible to most people in Malawi . For example , the South East region of Malawi has disproportionately low access to antiretroviral drugs . In many rural areas , poor health infrastructure combined with widespread famine have made sustained , high @-@ quality antiretroviral therapy difficult or impossible . In addition , donations from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria were used to fund antiretroviral therapy programs that distributed medication on a " first @-@ come , first @-@ served " basis , making the drugs more accessible to the male , urban , educated population . Because there are no explicit policies regarding the fair distribution of antiretroviral drugs in Malawi , individual health care workers often become responsible for deciding who will receive treatment , which inevitably leads to inequitable distribution . 
 = = = Condom distribution = = = 
 Although condoms effectively prevent the sexual transmission of HIV , several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi . People living in non @-@ urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms , and condoms are not typically available at bars and other social locations where they could have a significant impact on HIV prevention . Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV . However , despite these factors , many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV / AIDS epidemic have increased . 
 Non @-@ governmental organizations such as Population Services International ( Malawi ) , an organization that strives to improve the health of Malawians , and Banja La Mtsogolo , an organization that distributes information and resources related to family planning , have conducted campaigns advertising condom use as an effective form of protection against HIV / AIDS . Banja La Mtsogolo provides condoms to both men and women , and has significantly improved the availability of condoms for women in particular . Because of efforts by Population Services International , Banja La Mtsogolo , and many other organizations , condoms have become more widely available to many people in Malawi . 
 = = = Voluntary counseling and testing = = = 
 People living in areas with high rates of HIV / AIDS face several psychological barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for HIV . For example , people may prefer not to know if they are HIV @-@ positive because , due to the obstacles they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs , many view HIV / AIDS diagnoses as death sentences . Others may simply believe that they are HIV @-@ negative , either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease . However , despite these barriers , both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently : 1 @,@ 392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011 . Certain non @-@ governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation ( <unk> ) provide door @-@ to @-@ door counseling and testing services , which have drastically improved the accessibility of HIV testing . 
 = HMS Hotspur ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Hotspur was an H @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s . During the Spanish Civil War of 1936 – 1939 the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters , enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict . During the Norwegian Campaign of the Second World War , she fought in the First Battle of Narvik in April 1940 where she was badly damaged . After her repairs were completed , Hotspur was transferred to Gibraltar where she participated in the Battle of Dakar in September . A month later the ship was badly damaged when she rammed and sank an Italian submarine . She received permanent repairs in Malta and was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet when they were finished in early 1941 . Hotspur participated in the Battle of Cape Matapan in March and evacuated British and Australian troops from both Greece and Crete in April – May . In June the ship participated in the Syria @-@ Lebanon Campaign and was escorting convoys and the larger ships of the Mediterranean Fleet until she was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in March 1942 . 
 Hotspur did not see any action during the Japanese Indian Ocean raid in April , but she did escort an aircraft carrier in September during the later stages of the invasion of Madagascar . In June 1942 the ship returned to the Mediterranean to escort another convoy to Malta ( Operation Vigorous ) . She was converted to an escort destroyer beginning in March 1943 in the United Kingdom and was assigned to escort convoys in the North Atlantic for most of the rest of the war . After a lengthy refit in late 1944 , Hotspur escorted convoys in the Irish Sea until the end of the Second World War in May 1945 . 
 After the war the ship was used both as a training ship and on active duty until she was placed in reserve in early 1948 . She was sold to the Dominican Republic late that year and renamed Trujillo . After the death of Rafael Trujillo , who ruled the Dominican Republic from 1930 until his assassination in 1961 , the ship was renamed Duarte in 1962 , and finally was sold for scrap in 1972 .

 Hotspur displaced 1 @,@ 350 long tons ( 1 @,@ 370 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 883 long tons ( 1 @,@ 913 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 323 feet ( 98 @.@ 5 m ) , a beam of 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 5 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 34 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 25 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers . Hotspur carried a maximum of 470 long tons ( 480 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 5 @,@ 530 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 240 km ; 6 @,@ 360 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime , but this increased to 146 in wartime . 
 The ship mounted four 45 @-@ calibre 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) Mark IX guns in single mounts . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Hotspur had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began . 
 Beginning in mid @-@ 1940 , the ship 's anti @-@ aircraft armament was increased although when exactly the modifications were made is not known . The rear set of torpedo tubes was replaced by a 3 @-@ inch ( 76 @.@ 2 mm ) ( 12 @-@ pounder ) AA gun and the quadruple .50 @-@ calibre Vickers mounts were replaced by 20 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) Oerlikon autocannon . Two more Oerlikon guns were also added in the forward superstructure .

 Hotspur was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding & Engineering Company , Greenock , Scotland on 27 February 1935 , launched on 23 March 1936 and completed on 29 December 1936 . Excluding government @-@ furnished equipment like the armament , the ship cost £ 253 @,@ 037 . She was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning . Hotspur patrolled Spanish waters in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the policies of the Non @-@ Intervention Committee . The ship received an overhaul at Gibraltar between 16 December 1937 and 17 January 1938 . She resumed patrolling Spanish waters in 1938 and 1939 . After the end of the Spanish Civil War , Hotspur began a refit in Sheerness Dockyard in August 1939 , but this was cancelled later in the month as tensions rose just before the beginning of the Second World War . 
 She sailed later that month for the Mediterranean , but , once she reached Gibraltar , she was diverted to Freetown , Sierra Leone to search for German commerce raiders . The ship was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in October and was refitted in Sheerness between 18 January and 6 March 1940 . On 6 April Hotspur and the rest of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla escorted the four destroyer minelayers of the 20th Destroyer Flotilla as they sailed to implement Operation Wilfred , an operation to lay mines in the Vestfjord to prevent the transport of Swedish iron ore from Narvik to Germany . The mines were laid on the early morning of 8 April , before the Germans began their invasion , and the destroyers joined the battlecruiser Renown and her escorts . 
 During the First Battle of Narvik on 10 April the ship , together with her sister ship , Hostile , was initially deployed to secure the escape route of the other three destroyers of the 2nd Flotilla and deal with any captured coast defence guns . Hotspur did eventually move forward and fired four torpedoes into Narvik harbour , sinking at least two merchant ships . As the British ships were leaving the vicinity of Narvik they encountered five German destroyers at close range . Two of the German ships crossed the T of the British ships and quickly set Hardy on fire and forced her to run aground . Hunter eventually took the lead , but was severely damaged by the Germans , probably including one torpedo hit , and her speed dropped rapidly . Hotspur , immediately behind her , was temporarily out of control due to two hits and rammed her from behind . When the ships managed to disengage , Hunter capsized and Hotspur moved ahead slowly , engaged by all five German destroyers . Havock and Hostile had disengaged earlier , but came back to save Hotspur . Hostile laid a smoke screen that allowed Hotspur to escape while Havock engaged the German ships . Hostile escorted the badly damaged Hotspur to the repair base set up at Flakstadøya in the Lofoten Islands . During the battle the ship had been hit seven times by German shells which knocked out No. 2 boiler , all electrical circuits , her depth charges , her rangefinder and killed 18 of her crew . Temporary repairs allowed Hotspur to sail for Chatham Dockyard where she was repaired from 2 May to 16 July . 
 After her repairs were completed the ship was transferred to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla of the North Atlantic Command , based at Gibraltar . During Operation Hurry , Hotspur , and three other destroyers , escorted the aircraft carrier Argus to a position south @-@ west of Sardinia so the carrier could fly off her Hawker Hurricane fighters to Malta on 2 August . On 11 September , the ship spotted the Vichy French cruisers Georges <unk> , Gloire and Montcalm and three escorting destroyers en route from Toulon to Gabon . She escorted the capital ships of Force H during the Battle of Dakar on 23 September , but was not engaged . On 20 October , Hotspur , the destroyer Griffin and her sister Gallant sank the Italian submarine Lafolè east of Gibraltar . The ship was badly damaged when she rammed the submarine and she was given temporary repairs at Gibraltar between 22 October and 20 November . She escorted a troop convoy from Gibraltar to Malta in late November during Operation Collar . Permanent repairs were made at Malta between 29 November and 20 February 1941 .

 After her repairs were completed , Hotspur was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet . The ship escorted the capital ships of the Mediterranean Fleet during the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941 . In mid @-@ April she escorted the fast transport MV Breconshire and three battleships from Alexandria to Malta before going on to escort the battleships as they bombarded Tripoli on 20 April . After refuelling in Alexandria on 23 April , Hotspur sailed for Greece to begin evacuating British and Australian troops from the beaches . On 8 May , the ship again escorted the capital ships of the Mediterranean Fleet as they covered another convoy from Alexandria to Malta before being detached to escort the light cruiser Ajax as she bombarded Benghazi harbour on 7 / 8 May and sank two Italian merchant ships . During the evacuation of Crete Hotspur had to scuttle the destroyer Imperial on 29 May after the latter ship 's steering had been disabled by a near miss by a bomb . 
 The ship escorted the LSI ( L ) Glengyle during the opening stage of the Syria @-@ Lebanon Campaign of June 1941 and also hunted for French submarines . From July to November , Hotspur escorted convoys to Tobruk On 25 November , she was escorting the battleship Barham when that ship was torpedoed by German submarine U @-@ 331 . Hotspur and the other escorting destroyers rescued 451 men . The ship escorted the light cruiser Naiad when she bombarded Derna in early December . While escorting a convoy , Hotspur and her sister , Hasty , sank U @-@ 79 on 23 December north of Sollum . 
 = = = 1942 = = = 
 During a convoy to Malta in January 1942 , the ship was detailed to escort the merchant ship Thermopylae to Benghazi when she started having engine trouble . En route , however , Thermopylae was sunk by air attack on 19 January . On 23 March Hotspur was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean and was assigned to Force A of the fleet during the Indian Ocean raid by the Japanese in early April 1942 . The ship returned to the Mediterranean to participate in Operation Vigorous , another convoy from Alexandria to Malta , in June . Hotspur was forced to sink her sister , Hasty , after the latter was damaged by a torpedo from German motor torpedo boat S @-@ 55 . After the ship returned to the Indian Ocean , she escorted the carrier Illustrious when that ship supported operations on Madagascar in September . Hotspur remained in the Indian Ocean until January 1943 when she was transferred to Freetown , where she arrived on 14 February . The ship remained there only briefly before being transferred home to begin a conversion to an escort destroyer . The conversion began at Sheerness on 1 March and lasted until 31 May . 
 A Type 271 surface search radar replaced the fire @-@ control director and rangefinder above the bridge . A Type 290 surface warning radar was added at the top of the foremast . A High frequency direction finding system was added on a pole mast aft . The ship also received a Type 242 IFF system . Two 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch guns were removed , one each forward and aft , and the forward gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti @-@ submarine spigot mortar . The 3 @-@ inch anti @-@ aircraft gun amidships was also removed , but the number of 20 mm AA guns was increased to six . 
 Hotspur was assigned to Escort Group C4 in June after working up and escorted convoys in the North Atlantic . She was transferred to the 14th Escort Group in June 1944 and refitted in Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness between 31 October and 9 March 1945 . Escort duties in the Irish Sea followed until Victory in Europe Day . Sometime before this , the ship 's Hedgehog was replaced by a 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch gun . Hotspur was briefly assigned to the Rosyth Escort Force before being transferred to the Derry Training Squadron in August . 
 Hotspur was reassigned to the 4th Escort Group in June 1946 until she was refitted at Portsmouth Dockyard in February – March 1947 . The ship was then assigned to the 3rd Escort Flotilla based at Portland Harbour . She was selected to be scrapped in November 1947 and was placed in reserve on 20 January 1948 pending disposal . 
 Hotspur was sold to the Dominican Republic on 23 November 1948 and renamed Trujillo . By this time the ship carried a Type 291 air warning radar and an American SG @-@ 1 surface search radar . Four 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) Bofors guns replaced the 20 mm Oerlikons . In June 1953 , she was one of a number of foreign warships to attend Queen Elizabeth II 's Coronation Review at Spithead . After the death of Rafael Trujillo , the ship was renamed Duarte in 1962 . She was sold for scrap in 1972 . 
 = Tommy Flanagan = 
 Thomas Lee Flanagan ( March 16 , 1930 – November 16 , 2001 ) was an American jazz pianist and composer . He grew up in Detroit , initially influenced by such pianists as Art Tatum , Teddy Wilson , and Nat King Cole , and then by the newer bebop musicians . Within months of moving to New York in 1956 , he had recorded with Miles Davis and on Sonny Rollins ' landmark Saxophone Colossus . Recordings under various leaders , including the historically important Giant Steps of John Coltrane , and The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery , continued well into 1962 , when he became vocalist Ella Fitzgerald 's full @-@ time accompanist . He stayed for three years , then returned to be her pianist and musical director in 1968 , and stayed for a decade . 
 After leaving Fitzgerald again , Flanagan attracted praise for the elegance of his playing , which was principally in trio settings when under his own leadership . In his 45 @-@ year recording career , he recorded more than three dozen albums under his own name and more than 200 as a sideman . By the time of his death he was one of the most widely admired of jazz pianists and had influenced both his contemporaries and later generations of players . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Flanagan was born in Conant Gardens , Detroit , Michigan , on March 16 , 1930 . He was the youngest of six children – five boys and a girl . His parents were both originally from Georgia . His father , Johnson Sr , was a postman , and his mother , Ida Mae , worked in the garment industry . 
 At the age of six , his parents gave him a clarinet for Christmas . He learned to read music from playing that instrument , but within a few years he preferred the piano . The family had a piano in the house , and Flanagan received lessons from one of his brothers , Johnson , and Gladys Wade Dillard , who also taught Kirk Lightsey and Barry Harris . Flanagan graduated from Northern High School , which he attended with other future musicians , including Sonny Red . 
 Flanagan 's early influences included Art Tatum and Teddy Wilson , both of whom he heard on radio and playing in the Detroit area , as well as Nat King Cole and local pianists Earl Van Riper and Willie Anderson . These , however , played in an earlier style , and the young Flanagan and his friends were more interested in the newer bebop , including that played by pianist Bud Powell , who had a strong effect on Flanagan 's musical thinking and improvising .

 Flanagan 's first concert was around 1945 , with trombonist Frank Rosolino . Flanagan 's age meant that he could not stay in the bar area of the club , so between sets he went to another room and did some homework . As a teenager , he played in a band led by Lucky Thompson that also contained Pepper Adams and Kenny Burrell . Still in his teens , Flanagan also sat in on piano for some appearances by Charlie Parker in Detroit . During 1949 Flanagan had his first residence , at the Blue Bird Inn in Detroit . In 1950 he played with Rudy Rutherford , until the clarinetist returned to the Count Basie band . Flanagan then played jazz and rhythm and blues with saxophonist George Benson in Toledo , before being drafted into the army in 1951 . 
 After basic training in Fort Leonard Wood , Missouri , Flanagan auditioned as a pianist for an army show . He got the role , which prevented him from being sent to the Korean War at that time , but around a year later he was sent to Kunsan , with the war ongoing . There , he worked as a motion @-@ picture @-@ projector operator . After two years ' service he was discharged and returned to Detroit , where he soon became pianist at the Blue Bird again . He again worked with Burrell , as well as Donald Byrd and Yusef Lateef , among others .

 Flanagan moved to New York in 1956 . He was unsure of how long he would stay , having been persuaded to go by Burrell ; the pair initially stayed with Burrell 's aunt in Harlem . Flanagan soon found work in clubs and studios , including recording Detroit – New York Junction with Thad Jones in March . Later the same month he returned to recording , this time with Miles Davis and Sonny Rollins , for tracks released on Collectors ' Items . Rollins was leader for another session three months later : Saxophone Colossus , which was labeled an " undisputed masterpiece " by The Penguin Guide to Jazz . 
 Flanagan also first accompanied Ella Fitzgerald in 1956 , for around a month , including at the Newport Jazz Festival . Later that year he joined trombonist J. J. Johnson , with whom he recorded several albums in 1957 and then toured Europe . While in Sweden , Flanagan , with bassist Wilbur Little and drummer Elvin Jones , recorded his first album as leader , Overseas . Late in 1957 he was part of Miles Davis ' band for a short period , before returning to Johnson early the following year , for another stay of 10 months . A period leading his own trio in 1958 was followed by joining trombonist Tyree Glenn . 
 Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s Flanagan made frequent appearances in recording studios , for a large number of leaders and record labels . In May 1959 he was part of a groundbreaking recording : John Coltrane 's Giant Steps , described by The Penguin Guide to Jazz as the saxophonist 's " first genuinely iconic record " . The technical complexity of the music , particularly of the title track , meant that there were numerous false starts and rejected takes , and the initially released take of " Giant Steps " is a rare instance on record of Flanagan sounding uncertain . Another appearance on a landmark recording came in January of the following year : Flanagan was a member of the quartet that made The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery ; his playing complemented that of the guitarist , using controlled force on bebop numbers and delicacy on a ballad track . 
 Flanagan was with trumpeter Harry Edison in 1959 – 60 , and tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins in 1961 – 62 , including a UK tour . In this period , Flanagan recorded albums for several leaders from an earlier era , including Lionel Hampton , Jo Jones , and Pee Wee Russell , as well as one with Edison and around 10 with Hawkins . Flanagan then played with guitarist Jim Hall and bassist Percy Heath as a trio in New York . 
 In 1962 , he was asked by jazz impresario Norman Granz to become Ella Fitzgerald 's full @-@ time accompanist . Flanagan was looking for steadier work than was available with Hawkins , so he accepted . He worked with Fitzgerald from 1962 to 1965 . They toured internationally , including to Japan in 1964 . He also played with other bands when not required by the vocalist ; these included a brief reunion with Rollins in 1965 . Later the same year , Flanagan left Fitzgerald and was part of Art Farmer 's short @-@ lived New York Jazz Sextet , which recorded Group Therapy . Flanagan then became accompanist to Tony Bennett for part of 1966 , and lived on the West Coast . 
 Flanagan returned to working with Fitzgerald in 1968 . In addition to being her pianist , mostly as part of a trio , he was her musical director . Her popularity meant that a lot of touring was required : 40 – 45 weeks a year , including at least one tour of Europe a year ( 29 cities there in 1970 , for example ) . During these concerts , Flanagan often played a set as part of his trio , without the singer . Beginning in 1974 , he again began to perform and record as a leader : his 1975 trio release , The Tommy Flanagan Tokyo Recital , was his first as leader since 1960 . Prior to these performances , he had felt that his technique was inadequate for a soloist , but he enjoyed the extra exposure of being a leader , so decided to continue . Flanagan ended his role with Fitzgerald in 1978 , after he had a heart attack and had become tired of extensive touring . After the heart attack , he stopped smoking , reduced the amount that he drank , and exercised by walking more than he had previously . 
 = = = Late 1978 – 2001 – After Ella Fitzgerald = = = 
 Soon after leaving Fitzgerald , Flanagan played solo piano in New York . In 1979 he was a guest on the first series of Marian <unk> 's Piano Jazz radio programs . He continued to work with other players , including as a trio with Tal Farlow and Red Mitchell in 1980 . For much of the 1980s he led a trio that featured bassist George Mraz and various drummers . By around 1990 Flanagan was concentrating on his own appearances and recordings rather than sideman activities . In the early 1990s Mraz was replaced by Peter Washington , whose heavier bass lines added urgency to the trio 's sound . 
 Flanagan 's reputation gradually grew after he moved on from being primarily an accompanist : in a 1992 article , critic Leonard Feather suggested that " Flanagan is the pianist most likely to be named a personal idol by other jazz pianists , whether they be swing veterans or avant @-@ gardists " . This made him more in demand ; the workload may have contributed to his collapse in 1991 and subsequent quadruple bypass heart surgery . He returned to playing within weeks , but also returned to hospital for treatment for an aneurysm . Flanagan was awarded the Danish <unk> Prize in 1993 . Three years later , he was selected for a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Fellowship . In 1990 , 1993 and 1997 , Flanagan toured Japan , where he was very popular , with 100 Golden Fingers , a 10 @-@ pianist group . 
 Flanagan continued to be praised for the elegance of his playing – critic Ben Ratliff commented in 1998 that the trio with Washington and drummer Lewis Nash was , " in its controlled , elegant way , [ ... ] one of the more extraordinarily coordinated piano trios in jazz 's history " . Despite the near @-@ unanimous praise from critics and musicians for Flanagan 's recordings and concert performances after he left Fitzgerald , he did not secure a recording contract with a major label for more than one album . 
 In late October 2001 , Flanagan played in a John Coltrane tribute at the San Francisco Jazz Festival . The following month , he was admitted to Mount Sinai hospital in Manhattan ; less than a fortnight later , on November 16 , he died there , from complications related to the aneurysm he had suffered a decade earlier . 
 = = Personality and family life = = 
 Flanagan first married in 1960 , to Ann . The couple had a son and two daughters , and divorced in the early 1970s ; Ann was killed in a car accident in 1980 . Flanagan 's mother died in 1959 , and his father in 1977 . Flanagan married Diana , his second wife , in 1976 . He was survived by Diana , the three children from his first marriage , and six grandchildren . 
 Flanagan was usually self @-@ effacing , reserved and amiable . His personality was summarized by his second wife : " His gentleness and quietness are deceptive . He is a strong man , and he has a lot of spirit and firmness . " 
 = = Playing style = = 
 Whitney Balliett stated that Flanagan was the most consistent of the pianists influenced by Wilson , Tatum and Cole , and invariably created something new in his playing : he " often states the melody with dissonant , levering chords played offbeat or staccato . Never decorative , they [ ... ] reveal both a respect for the melody and an intense desire to alter it " ; during his main improvising , he used " interval @-@ filled descending figures [ ... ] charging rhythmic phrases whose accented first notes make the succeeding notes snap , double @-@ time phrases that race ahead to clear the way , and legato phrases that form sauntering rear guards . " In a review of a 1989 concert , Feather commented that Flanagan used " subtle dynamic shadings " , while " bursts of <unk> chords sometimes lent an element of surprise , with a nimble left hand offering graceful filigree fills " and occasional musical quotes that added humor . Other techniques he employed were , in Stanley Crouch 's description , " crooning effects achieved by manipulating the pedals , holding down keys long enough to sustain notes in decisively different ways , and working out inflections that evoke the voice – sighs , moans , swells , purrs " . Critic John S. Wilson described Flanagan 's solo piano style on ballads in 1978 : " He drifts through ballads with a dreamy <unk> flow , but it is not a soft or flabby style . There is , beneath the surface , a vitality that gives it a lean , swinging character " . 
 Although he acknowledged the influence of other pianists , Flanagan stated that , " I like to play like a horn player , like I 'm blowing into the piano . The sound of a piece – its over @-@ all tonality – is what concerns me . " In concerts , Flanagan typically played a range of composers ' works and , once he had become established as a small @-@ group leader , he often played songs by <unk> Dameron , Duke Ellington , Benny Golson , Thad Jones , Tom McIntosh , and Thelonious Monk . 
 = = Awards and legacy = = 
 During his career , Flanagan was nominated for five Grammy Awards . The first occasion was in 1983 : The Magnificent Tommy Flanagan for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance , Soloist ; and Giant Steps for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance , Group . Two years later , <unk> was nominated for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance , Soloist . The next nomination was in 1998 , for Best Jazz Instrumental Solo for his solo on " Dear Old Stockholm " from Sea Changes . The last , in 2003 , was in the same category , for Flanagan 's solo on " Sunset & the Mockingbird " , from A Great Night in Harlem . 
 Flanagan 's influence on pianists extended from his contemporaries to later generations . Contemporaries included fellow Detroit players Barry Harris and Roland Hanna . Lightsey was influenced by Flanagan 's musical creative thinking and pianistic fluidity . Alan Broadbent also acknowledged Flanagan as an influence , as did Helen Sung , who changed from being a classical music pianist to a jazz one after hearing the swing and logic of a Flanagan solo . Kenny Barron described Flanagan as his " hero " and stated that he admired the older man 's touch and phrasing from when he first heard it at junior high school : " He became an influence and continued to be an influence till the day he died – and he still is .

 = Pedro II of Brazil = 
 Dom Pedro II ( English : Peter II ; 2 December 1825 – 5 December 1891 ) , nicknamed " the Magnanimous " , was the second and last ruler of the Empire of Brazil , reigning for over 58 years . Born in Rio de Janeiro , he was the seventh child of Emperor Dom Pedro I of Brazil and Empress Dona Maria Leopoldina and thus a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza . His father 's abrupt abdication and departure to Europe in 1831 left a five @-@ year @-@ old Pedro II as Emperor and led to a grim and lonely childhood and adolescence . Obliged to spend his time studying in preparation for rule , he knew only brief moments of happiness and encountered few friends of his age . His experiences with court intrigues and political disputes during this period greatly affected his later character . Pedro II grew into a man with a strong sense of duty and devotion toward his country and his people . On the other hand , he was increasingly resentful of his role as monarch . 
 Inheriting an Empire on the verge of disintegration , Pedro II turned Portuguese @-@ speaking Brazil into an emerging power in the international arena . The nation grew to be distinguished from its Hispanic neighbors on account of its political stability , zealously guarded freedom of speech , respect for civil rights , vibrant economic growth and especially for its form of government : a functional , representative parliamentary monarchy . Brazil was also victorious in three international conflicts ( the Platine War , the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War ) under his rule , as well as prevailing in several other international disputes and domestic tensions . Pedro II steadfastly pushed through the abolition of slavery despite opposition from powerful political and economic interests . A savant in his own right , the Emperor established a reputation as a vigorous sponsor of learning , culture and the sciences . He won the respect and admiration of scholars such as Charles Darwin , Victor Hugo and Friedrich Nietzsche , and was a friend to Richard Wagner , Louis Pasteur and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow , among others . 
 Although there was no desire for a change in the form of government among most Brazilians , the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d 'état that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator . Pedro II had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy 's future prospects , despite its overwhelming popular support . He allowed no prevention of his ouster and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy . He spent the last two years of his life in exile in Europe , living alone on very little money . 
 The reign of Pedro II thus came to an unusual end — he was overthrown while highly regarded by the people and at the pinnacle of his popularity , and some of his accomplishments were soon brought to naught as Brazil slipped into a long period of weak governments , dictatorships , and constitutional and economic crises . The men who had exiled him soon began to see in him a model for the Brazilian republic . A few decades after his death , his reputation was restored and his remains were returned to Brazil with celebrations nationwide . Historians have regarded the Emperor in an extremely positive light and several have ranked him as the greatest Brazilian . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Birth = = = 
 Pedro was born at 02 : 30 on 2 December 1825 in the Palace of São Cristóvão , in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . Named after St. Peter of Alcantara , his name in full was Pedro de Alcântara João Carlos Leopoldo Salvador <unk> Francisco Xavier de Paula <unk> Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga . Through his father , Emperor Dom Pedro I , he was a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza ( Portuguese : Bragança ) and was referred to using the honorific " Dom " ( Lord ) from birth . He was the grandson of Portuguese King Dom João VI and nephew of Dom Miguel I. His mother was the Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria , daughter of Franz II , the last Holy Roman Emperor . Through his mother , Pedro was a nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte and first cousin of Emperors Napoleon II of France , Franz Joseph I of Austria @-@ Hungary and Don Maximiliano I of Mexico . 
 The only legitimate male child of Pedro I to survive infancy , he was officially recognized as heir apparent to the Brazilian throne with the title Prince Imperial on 6 August 1826 . Empress Maria Leopoldina died on 11 December 1826 , a few days after a stillbirth , when Pedro was a year old . Two and a half years later , his father married Amélie of Leuchtenberg . Prince Pedro developed an affectionate relationship with her , whom he came to regard as his mother . Pedro I 's desire to restore his daughter Maria II to her Portuguese throne , which had been usurped by his brother Miguel I , as well as his declining political position at home led to his abrupt abdication on 7 April 1831 . He and Amélie immediately departed for Europe , leaving behind the Prince Imperial , who became Emperor Dom Pedro II . 
 = = = Early coronation = = = 
 Upon leaving the country , Emperor Pedro I selected three people to take charge of his son and remaining daughters . The first was José Bonifácio de Andrada , his friend and an influential leader during Brazilian independence , who was named guardian . The second was Mariana de Verna , who had held the post of aia ( governess ) since the birth of Pedro II . As a child , the then @-@ Prince Imperial called her " Dadama " , as he could not pronounce the word dama ( Lady ) correctly . He regarded her as his surrogate mother , and would continue to call her by her nickname well into adulthood out of affection . The third person was Rafael , an Afro @-@ Brazilian veteran of the Cisplatine War . He was an employee in the Palace of São Cristóvão whom Pedro I deeply trusted and asked to look after his son — a charge that he carried out for the rest of his life . 
 Bonifácio was dismissed from his position in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian . Pedro II spent his days studying , with only two hours set aside for amusements . Intelligent , he was able to acquire knowledge with great ease . However , the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding . He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters . All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave Pedro II an unhappy and lonely upbringing . The environment in which he was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw books as a refuge and retreat from the real world . 
 The possibility of lowering the young Emperor 's age of majority , instead of waiting until he turned 18 , had been floated since 1835 . His elevation to the throne had led to a troublesome period of endless crises . The regency created to rule on his behalf was plagued from the start by disputes between political factions and rebellions across the nation . Those politicians who had risen to power during the 1830s had by now also become familiar with the pitfalls of rule . According to historian Roderick J. Barman , by 1840 " they had lost all faith in their ability to rule the country on their own . They accepted Pedro II as an authority figure whose presence was indispensable for the country 's survival . " When asked by politicians if he would like to assume full powers , Pedro II shyly accepted . On the following day , 23 July 1840 , the General Assembly ( the Brazilian Parliament ) formally declared the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Pedro II of age . He was later acclaimed , crowned and consecrated on 18 July 1841 . 
 = = Consolidation = = 
 = = = Imperial authority established = = = 
 Removal of the factious regency brought stability to the government . Pedro II was seen nationwide as a legitimate source of authority , whose position placed him above partisanship and petty disputes . He was , however , still no more than a boy , and a shy , insecure and immature one . His nature resulted from his broken childhood , when he experienced abandonment , intrigue and betrayal . Behind the scenes , a group of high @-@ ranking palace servants and notable politicians led by Aureliano Coutinho ( later Viscount of Sepetiba ) became known as the " Courtier Faction " as they established influence over the young Emperor . Some were very close to him , such as Mariana de Verna and Steward Paulo Barbosa da Silva . Pedro II was deftly used by the Courtiers against their actual or suspected foes . 
 The Brazilian government secured the hand of Princess Teresa Cristina of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies . She and Pedro II were married by proxy in Naples on 30 May 1843 . Upon seeing her in person , the Emperor was noticeably disappointed . Teresa Cristina was short , a bit overweight and though not ugly , neither was she pretty . He did little to hide his disillusionment . One observer stated that he turned his back to Teresa Cristina , another depicted him as being so shocked that he needed to sit , and it is possible that both occurred . That evening , Pedro II wept and complained to Mariana de Verna , " They have deceived me , Dadama ! " It took several hours to convince him that duty demanded that he proceed . The Nuptial Mass , with the ratification of the vows previously taken by proxy and the conferral of the nuptial blessing , occurred on the following day , 4 September . 
 In late 1845 and early 1846 the Emperor made a tour of Brazil 's southern provinces , traveling through São Paulo ( of which Paraná was a part at this time ) , Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul . He was buoyed by the warm and enthusiastic responses he received . By then Pedro II had matured physically and mentally . He grew into a man who , at 1 @.@ 90 meters ( 6 ft 3 in ) tall with blue eyes and blond hair , was seen as handsome . With growth , his weaknesses faded and his strengths of character came to the fore . He became self @-@ assured and learned to be not only impartial and diligent , but also courteous , patient and personable . Barman said that he kept " his emotions under iron discipline . He was never rude and never lost his temper . He was exceptionally discreet in words and cautious in action . " Most importantly , this period saw the end of the Courtier Faction . Pedro II began to fully exercise authority and successfully engineered the end of the courtiers ' influence by removing them from his inner circle while avoiding any public disruption . 
 = = = Abolition of slave trade and war = = = 
 Pedro II was faced by three crises between 1848 and 1852 . The first test came in confronting the trade in illegally imported slaves . This had been banned in 1826 as part of a treaty with Great Britain . Trafficking continued unabated , however , and the British government 's passage of the Aberdeen Act of 1845 authorized British warships to board Brazilian shipping and seize any found involved in the slave trade . While Brazil grappled with this problem , the Praieira revolt erupted on 6 November 1848 . This was a conflict between local political factions within Pernambuco province ; it was suppressed by March 1849 . The Eusébio de Queirós Law was promulgated on 4 September 1850 which gave the Brazilian government broad authority to combat the illegal slave trade . With this new tool , Brazil moved to eliminate importation of slaves . By 1852 this first crisis was over , and Britain accepted that the trade had been suppressed . 
 The third crisis entailed a conflict with the Argentine Confederation regarding ascendancy over territories adjacent to the Río de la Plata and free navigation of that waterway . Since the 1830s , Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas had supported rebellions within Uruguay and Brazil . It was only in 1850 that Brazil was able to address the threat posed by Rosas . An alliance was forged between Brazil , Uruguay and disaffected Argentines , leading to the Platine War and the subsequent overthrow of the Argentine ruler in February 1852 . Barman said that a " considerable portion of the credit must be ... assigned to the Emperor , whose cool head , tenacity of purpose , and sense of what was feasible proved indispensable . " 
 The Empire 's successful navigation of these crises considerably enhanced the nation 's stability and prestige , and Brazil emerged as a hemispheric power . Internationally , Europeans began to regard the country as embodying familiar liberal ideals , such as freedom of the press and constitutional respect for civil liberties . Its representative parliamentary monarchy also stood in stark contrast to the mix of dictatorships and instability endemic in the other nations of South America during this period . 
 = = Growth = = 
 = = = Pedro II and politics = = = 
 At the beginning of the 1850s , Brazil enjoyed internal stability and economic prosperity . Under the prime ministry of Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão ( then @-@ Viscount and later Marquis of Paraná ) the Emperor advanced his own ambitious program : the <unk> ( conciliation ) and <unk> ( material developments ) . Pedro II 's reforms aimed to promote less political partisanship , and forward infrastructure and economic development . The nation was being interconnected through railroad , electric telegraph and steamship lines , uniting it into a single entity . The general opinion , both at home and abroad , was that these accomplishments had been possible due to Brazil 's " governance as a monarchy and the character of Pedro II " . 
 Pedro II was neither a British @-@ style figurehead nor an autocrat in the manner of Russian czars . The Emperor exercised power through cooperation with elected politicians , economic interests , and popular support . The active presence of Pedro II on the political scene was an important part of the government 's structure , which also included the cabinet , the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate ( the latter two formed the General Assembly ) . He used his participation in directing the course of government as a means of influence . His direction became indispensable , although it never devolved into " one @-@ man rule . " In his handling of the political parties , he " needed to maintain a reputation for impartiality , work in accord with the popular mood , and avoid any flagrant imposition of his will on the political scene . " 
 The Emperor 's more notable political successes were achieved primarily because of the non @-@ confrontational and cooperative manner with which he approached both issues and the partisan figures with whom he had to deal . He was remarkably tolerant , seldom taking offense at criticism , opposition or even incompetence . He did not have the constitutional authority to force acceptance of his initiatives without support , and his collaborative approach towards governing kept the nation progressing and enabled the political system to successfully function . The Emperor respected the prerogatives of the legislature , even when they resisted , delayed , or thwarted his goals and appointments . Most politicians appreciated and supported his role . Many had lived through the regency period , when the lack of an emperor who could stand above petty and special interests led to years of strife between political factions . Their experiences in public life had created a conviction that Pedro II was " indispensable to Brazil 's continued peace and prosperity . " 
 = = = Domestic life = = = 
 The marriage between Pedro II and Teresa Cristina started off badly . With maturity , patience and their first child , Afonso , their relationship improved . Later Teresa Cristina gave birth to more children : Isabel , in 1846 ; Leopoldina , in 1847 ; and lastly , Pedro , in 1848 . However , both boys died when very young , which devastated the Emperor . Beyond suffering as a father , his view of the Empire 's future changed completely . Despite his affection for his daughters , he did not believe that Princess Isabel , although his heir , would have any chance of prospering on the throne . He felt his successor needed to be male for the monarchy to be viable . He increasingly saw the imperial system as being tied so inextricably to himself , that it would not survive him . Isabel and her sister received a remarkable education , although they were given no preparation for governing the nation . Pedro II excluded Isabel from participation in government business and decisions . 
 Sometime around 1850 , Pedro II began having discreet affairs with other women . The most famous and enduring of these relationships involved Luísa <unk> Portugal de Barros , Countess of Barral , with whom he formed a romantic and intimate , though not adulterous , friendship after she was appointed governess to the emperor 's daughters in November 1856 . Throughout his life , the Emperor held onto a hope of finding a soulmate , something he felt cheated of due to the necessity of a marriage of state to a woman for whom he never felt passion . This is but one instance illustrating his dual identity : one who assiduously carried out his duty in the role of emperor which destiny had assigned to him and another who considered the imperial office an unrewarding burden and who was happier in the worlds of literature and science . 
 Pedro II was hard @-@ working and his routine was demanding . He usually woke up at 07 : 00 and did not sleep before 02 : 00 in the morning . His entire day was devoted to the affairs of state and the meager free time available was spent reading and studying . The Emperor went about his daily routine dressed in a simple black tail coat , trousers , and cravat . For special occasions he would wear court dress , and he only appeared in full regalia with crown , mantle and scepter twice each year at the opening and closing of the General Assembly . Pedro II held politicians and government officials to the strict standards which he exemplified . The Emperor adopted a strict policy for the selection of civil servants based on morality and merit . To set the standard , he lived simply , once having said : " I also understand that useless expenditure is the same as stealing from the Nation . " Balls and assemblies of the Court ceased after 1852 . He also refused to request or allow the amount of his civil list of Rs 800 : 000 $ 000 per year ( U.S. $ 405 @,@ 000 or £ 90 @,@ 000 in 1840 ) to be raised from the declaration of his majority until his dethronement almost fifty years later . 
 = = = Patron of arts and sciences = = = 
 " I was born to devote myself to culture and sciences " , the Emperor remarked in his private journal during 1862 . He had always been eager to learn and found in books a refuge from the demands of his position . Subjects which interested Pedro II were wide @-@ ranging , including anthropology , history , geography , geology , medicine , law , religious studies , philosophy , painting , sculpture , theater , music , chemistry , physics , astronomy , poetry and technology , among others . By the end of his reign , there were three libraries in São Cristóvão palace containing more than 60 @,@ 000 books . A passion for linguistics prompted him throughout his life to study new languages , and he was able to speak and write not only Portuguese but also Latin , French , German , English , Italian , Spanish , Greek , Arabic , Hebrew , Sanskrit , Chinese , Occitan and Tupi . He became the first Brazilian photographer when he acquired a daguerreotype camera in March 1840 . He set up one laboratory in São Cristóvão devoted to photography and another to chemistry and physics . He also had an astronomical observatory constructed . 
 Pedro II 's erudition amazed Friedrich Nietzsche when both met . Victor Hugo told the Emperor : " Sire , you are a great citizen , you are the grandson of Marcus Aurelius " , and Alexandre Herculano called him : " A Prince whom the general opinion holds as the foremost of his era because of his gifted mind , and due to the constant application of that gift to the sciences and culture . " He became a member of the Royal Society , the Russian Academy of Sciences , The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium and the American Geographical Society . In 1875 , he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences , an honor previously granted to only two other heads of state : Peter the Great and Napoleon Bonaparte . Pedro II exchanged letters with scientists , philosophers , musicians and other intellectuals . Many of his correspondents became his friends , including Richard Wagner , Louis Pasteur , Louis Agassiz , John Greenleaf Whittier , Michel Eugène Chevreul , Alexander Graham Bell , Henry Wadsworth Longfellow , Arthur de Gobineau , Frédéric Mistral , Alessandro Manzoni , Alexandre Herculano , Camilo Castelo Branco and James Cooley Fletcher . 
 The Emperor considered education to be of national importance and was himself a concrete example of the value of learning . He remarked : " Were I not an Emperor , I would like to be a teacher . I do not know of a task more noble than to direct young minds and prepare the men of tomorrow . " His reign saw the creation of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute to promote research and preservation in the historical , geographical , cultural and social sciences . The Imperial Academy of Music and National Opera and the Pedro II School were also founded , the latter serving as a model for schools throughout Brazil . The Imperial Academy of the Fine Arts , established by his father , received further strengthening and support . Using his civil list income , Pedro II provided scholarships for Brazilian students to study at universities , art schools and conservatories of music in Europe . He also financed the creation of the Institute Pasteur , helped underwrite the construction of Wagner 's Bayreuth Festspielhaus , as well as subscribing to similar projects . His efforts were recognized both at home and abroad . Charles Darwin said of him : " The Emperor does so much for science , that every scientific man is bound to show him the utmost respect " .

 At the end of 1859 , Pedro II departed on a trip to provinces north of the capital , visiting Espírito Santo , Bahia , Sergipe , Alagoas , Pernambuco and Paraíba . He returned in February 1860 after four months . The trip was a huge success , with the Emperor welcomed everywhere with warmth and joy . The first half of the 1860s saw peace and prosperity in Brazil . Civil liberties were maintained . Freedom of speech had existed since Brazil 's independence and was strongly defended by Pedro II . He found newspapers from the capital and from the provinces an ideal way to keep track of public opinion and the nation 's overall situation . Another means of monitoring the Empire was through direct contacts with his subjects . One opportunity for this was during regular Tuesday and Saturday public audiences , where anyone of any social class ( including slaves ) could gain admittance and present their petitions and stories . Visits to schools , colleges , prisons , exhibitions , factories , barracks and other public appearances presented further opportunities to gather first @-@ hand information . 
 This tranquility disappeared when the British consul in Rio de Janeiro , William Dougal Christie , nearly sparked a war between his nation and Brazil . Christie sent an ultimatum containing abusive demands arising out of two minor incidents at the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862 . The first was the sinking of a commercial barque on the coast of Rio Grande do Sul after which its goods were pillaged by local inhabitants . The second was the arrest of drunken British officers who were causing a disturbance in the streets of Rio . 
 The Brazilian government refused to yield , and Christie issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity . Brazil prepared for what was seen as an imminent conflict . Pedro II was the main reason for Brazil 's resistance ; he rejected any suggestion of yielding . This response came as a surprise to Christie , who changed his tenor and proposed a peaceful settlement through international arbitration . The Brazilian government presented its demands and , upon seeing the British government 's position weaken , severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863 .

 As war with the British Empire threatened , Brazil had to turn its attention to its southern frontiers . Another civil war had begun in Uruguay as its political parties turned against each other . The internal conflict led to the murder of Brazilians and looting of their property in Uruguay . Brazil 's government decided to intervene , fearful of giving any impression of weakness in the face of conflict with the British . A Brazilian army invaded Uruguay in December 1864 , beginning the brief Uruguayan War , which ended in February 1865 . Meanwhile , the dictator of Paraguay , Francisco Solano López took advantage of the situation to establish his country as a regional power . The Paraguayan army invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso ( the area known after 1977 as the state of Mato Grosso do Sul ) , triggering the Paraguayan War . Four months later , Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory as a prelude to an attack on Rio Grande do Sul . 
 Aware of the anarchy in Rio Grande do Sul and the incapacity and incompetence of its military chiefs to resist the Paraguayan army , Pedro II decided to go to the front in person . Upon receiving objections from the cabinet , the General Assembly and the Council of State , Pedro II pronounced : " If they can prevent me from going as an Emperor , they cannot prevent me from abdicating and going as a Fatherland Volunteer " — an allusion to those Brazilians who volunteered to go to war and became known throughout the nation as the " Fatherland Volunteers " . The monarch himself was popularly called the " Number @-@ one volunteer " . Given permission to leave , Pedro II disembarked in Rio Grande do Sul in July and proceeded from there by land . He travelled overland by horse and wagon , sleeping at night in a campaign tent . In September , Pedro II arrived in Uruguaiana , a Brazilian town occupied by a besieged Paraguayan army . 
 The Emperor rode within rifle @-@ shot of Uruguaiana , but the Paraguayans did not attack him . To avoid further bloodshed , he offered terms of surrender to the Paraguayan commander , who accepted . Pedro II 's coordination of the military operations and his personal example played a decisive role in successfully repulsing the Paraguayan invasion of Brazilian territory . Before returning to Rio de Janeiro , he received the British diplomatic envoy Edward Thornton , who apologized on behalf of Queen Victoria and the British Government for the crisis between the empires . The Emperor regarded this diplomatic victory over the most powerful nation of the world as sufficient and renewed friendly relations . 
 = = = Total victory and its heavy costs = = = 
 Against all expectations , the war continued for five years . During this period , Pedro II 's time and energy were devoted to the war effort . He tirelessly worked to raise and equip troops to reinforce the front lines and to push forward the fitting of new warships for the navy . The rape of women , widespread violence against civilians , ransacking and destruction of properties that had occurred during Paraguay 's invasion of Brazilian territory had made a deep impression on him . He warned the Countess of Barral in November 1866 that " the war should be concluded as honor demands , cost what it cost . " " Difficulties , setbacks , and war @-@ weariness had no effect on his quiet resolve " , said Barman . Mounting casualties did not distract him from advancing what he saw as Brazil 's righteous cause , and he stood prepared to personally sacrifice his own throne to gain an honorable outcome . Writing in his journal a few years previously Pedro II remarked : " What sort of fear could I have ? That they take the government from me ? Many better kings than I have lost it , and to me it is no more than the weight of a cross which it is my duty to carry . " 
 At the same time , Pedro II worked to prevent quarrels between the national political parties from impairing the military response . The Emperor prevailed over a serious political crisis in July 1868 resulting from a quarrel between the cabinet and Luís Alves de Lima e Silva ( then @-@ Marques and later Duke of Caxias ) , the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Brazilian forces in Paraguay . Caxias was also a politician and was a member of the opposing party to the ministry . The Emperor sided with him , leading to the cabinet 's resignation . As Pedro II maneuvered to bring about a victorious outcome in the conflict with Paraguay , he threw his support behind the political parties and factions that seemed to be most useful in the effort . The reputation of the monarchy was harmed and its trusted position as an impartial mediator was severely impacted in the long term . He was unconcerned for his personal position , and regardless of the impact upon the imperial system , he determined to put the national interest ahead of any potential harm caused by such expediencies . 
 His refusal to accept anything short of total victory was pivotal in the final outcome . His tenacity was well @-@ paid with the news that López had died in battle on 1 March 1870 , bringing the war to a close . Pedro II turned down the General Assembly 's suggestion to erect an equestrian statue of him to commemorate the victory and chose instead to use the money to build elementary schools .

 In the 1870s progress was made in both social and political spheres , and all segments of society benefited from the reforms and shared in the increasing prosperity . Brazil 's international reputation for political stability and investment potential greatly improved . The Empire was seen as a modern and progressive nation unequalled , with the exception of the United States , in the Americas . The economy began growing rapidly and immigration flourished . Railroad , shipping and other modernization projects were adopted . With " slavery destined for extinction and other reforms projected , the prospects for ' moral and material advances ' seemed vast . " 
 In 1870 , few Brazilians opposed slavery and even fewer openly condemned it . Pedro II , who did not own slaves , was one of the few who did oppose slavery . Its abolition was a delicate subject . Slaves were used by everyone , from the richest to the poorest . Pedro II wanted to end the practice gradually to soften the impact to the national economy . With no constitutional authority to directly intervene to abolish slavery , the Emperor would need to use all his skills to convince , influence and gather support among politicians to achieve his goal . His first open move occurred back in 1850 , when he threatened to abdicate unless the General Assembly declared the Atlantic slave trade illegal . 
 Having dealt with the overseas supply of new slaves , Pedro II turned his attention in the early 1860s to removing the remaining source : enslavement of children born to slaves . Legislation was drafted at his initiative , but the conflict with Paraguay delayed discussion of the proposal in the General Assembly . Pedro II openly asked for the gradual eradication of slavery in the Speech from the Throne of 1867 . He was heavily criticized , and his move was condemned as " national suicide . " Critics argued " that abolition was his personal desire and not that of the nation . " He consciously ignored the growing political damage to his image and to the monarchy in consequence of his support for abolition . Eventually , a bill pushed through by Prime Minister José Paranhos , Viscount of Rio Branco , was enacted as the Law of Free Birth on 28 September 1871 , under which all children born to slave women after that date were considered free @-@ born .

 On 25 May 1871 Pedro II and his wife traveled to Europe . He had long desired to vacation abroad . When news arrived that his younger daughter , the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Leopoldina , had died in Vienna of typhoid fever on 7 February , he finally had a pressing reason to venture outside the Empire . Upon arriving in Lisbon , Portugal , he immediately went to the Janelas Verdes palace , where he met with his stepmother Amélie of Leuchtenberg . The two had not seen each other in forty years , and the meeting was emotional . Pedro II remarked in his journal : " I cried from happiness and also from sorrow seeing my Mother so affectionate toward me but so aged and so sick . " 
 The Emperor proceeded to visit Spain , Great Britain , Belgium , Germany , Austria , Italy , Egypt , Greece , Switzerland and France . In Coburg he visited his daughter 's tomb . He found this to be " a time of release and freedom " . He traveled under the assumed name " Dom Pedro de Alcântara " , insisting upon being treated informally and staying only in hotels . He spent his days sightseeing and conversing with scientists and other intellectuals with whom he shared interests . The European sojourn proved to be a success , and his demeanor and curiosity won respectful notices in the nations which he visited . The prestige of both Brazil and Pedro II were further enhanced during the tour when news came from Brazil that the Law of Free Birth , abolishing the last source of enslavement , had been ratified . The imperial party returned to Brazil in triumph on 31 March 1872 . 
 = = = Religious Question = = = 
 Soon after returning to Brazil , Pedro II was faced with an unexpected crisis . The Brazilian clergy had long been understaffed , undisciplined and poorly educated , leading to a great loss of respect for the Catholic Church . The imperial government had embarked upon a program of reform to address these deficiencies . As Catholicism was the state religion , the government exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs , paying clerical salaries , appointing parish priests , nominating bishops , ratifying papal bulls and overseeing seminaries . In pursuing reform , the government selected bishops who satisfied its criteria for education , support for reform and moral fitness . However , as more capable men began to fill the clerical ranks , resentment of government control over the Church increased . 
 The bishops of Olinda and Belém ( in the provinces of Pernambuco and Pará , respectively ) were two of the new generation of educated , zealous Brazilian clerics . They had been influenced by the <unk> which spread among Catholics in this period . In 1872 they ordered Freemasons expelled from lay brotherhoods . While European Masonry often tended towards atheism and anti @-@ clericalism , things were much different in Brazil where membership in Masonic orders was common — although Pedro II himself was not a Freemason . The government headed by the Viscount of Rio Branco tried on two separate occasions to persuade the bishops to repeal , but they refused . This led to their trial and conviction by the Superior Court of Justice . In 1874 they were sentenced four years at hard labor , although the Emperor commuted this to imprisonment only . 
 Pedro II played a decisive role by unequivocally backing the government 's actions . He was a conscientious adherent of Catholicism , which he viewed as advancing important civilizing and civic values . While he avoided anything that could be considered unorthodox , he felt free to think and behave independently . The Emperor accepted new ideas , such as Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution , of which he remarked that " the laws that he [ Darwin ] has discovered glorify the Creator " . He was moderate in his religious beliefs , but could not accept disrespect to civil law and government authority . As he told his son @-@ in @-@ law : " [ The government ] has to ensure that the constitution is obeyed . In these proceedings there is no desire to protect masonry ; but rather the goal of upholding the rights of the civilian power . " The crisis was resolved in September 1875 after the Emperor grudgingly agreed to grant full amnesty to the bishops and the Holy See annulled the <unk> .

 Once again the Emperor traveled abroad , this time going to the United States . He was accompanied by his faithful servant Rafael , who had raised him from childhood . Pedro II arrived in New York City on 15 April 1876 , and set out from there to travel throughout the country ; going as far as San Francisco in the west , New Orleans in the south , Washington , D.C. , and north to Toronto , Canada . The trip was " an unalloyed triumph " , Pedro II making a deep impression on the American people with his simplicity and kindness . He then crossed the Atlantic , where he visited Denmark , Sweden , Finland , Russia , Ottoman Empire , Greece , the Holy Land , Egypt , Italy , Austria , Germany , France , Britain , Netherlands , Switzerland and Portugal . He returned to Brazil on 22 September 1877 . 
 Pedro II 's trips abroad made a deep psychological impact . While traveling , he was largely freed of the restrictions imposed by his office . Under the pseudonym " Pedro de Alcântara " , he enjoyed moving about as an ordinary person , even taking a train journey solely with his wife . Only while touring abroad could the Emperor shake off the formal existence and demands of the life he knew in Brazil . It became more difficult to <unk> to his routine as head of state upon returning . Upon his sons ' early deaths , the Emperor 's faith in the monarchy 's future had evaporated . His trips abroad now made him resentful of the burden destiny had placed upon his shoulders when only a child of five . If he previously had no interest in securing the throne for the next generation , he now had no desire to keep it going during his own lifetime . 
 = = Decline and fall = = 
 = = = Decadence = = = 
 During the 1880s , Brazil continued to prosper and social diversity increased markedly , including the first organized push for women 's rights . On the other hand , letters written by Pedro II reveal a man grown world @-@ weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook . He remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the imperial office , albeit often without enthusiasm . Because of his increasing " indifference towards the fate of the regime " and his lack of action in support of the imperial system once it was challenged , historians have attributed the " prime , perhaps sole , responsibility " for the dissolution of the monarchy to the Emperor himself . 
 After their experience of the perils and obstacles of government , the political figures who had arisen during the 1830s saw the Emperor as providing a fundamental source of authority essential for governing and for national survival . These elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until , by the 1880s , they had almost entirely been replaced by a younger generation of politicians who had no experience of the early years of Pedro II 's reign , when internal and external dangers threatened the nation 's existence . They had only known a stable administration and prosperity . In sharp contrast to those of the previous era , the young politicians saw no reason to uphold and defend the imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation . 
 To those younger politicians Pedro II was merely an old and increasingly sick man who had steadily eroded his position by taking an active role in politics for decades . Before he had been above criticism , but now his every action and inaction prompted meticulous scrutiny and open criticism . Many young politicians had become apathetic toward the monarchic regime and , when the time came , they would do nothing to defend it . Pedro II 's role in achieving an era of national unity , stability and good government now went unremembered and unconsidered by the ruling elites . By his very success , the Emperor had made his position seem unnecessary . 
 The lack of an heir who could feasibly provide a new direction for the nation also diminished the long @-@ term prospects of the Brazilian monarchy . The Emperor loved his daughter Isabel , but he considered the idea of a female successor as antithetical to the role required of Brazil 's ruler . He viewed the death of his two sons as being a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted . Resistance to accepting a female ruler was also shared by the political establishment . Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne , Brazil was still very traditional , and only a male successor was thought capable as head of state . 
 = = = Slavery abolition and coup d 'état = = = 
 By June 1887 , the Emperor 's health had considerably worsened and his personal doctors suggested going to Europe for medical treatment . While in Milan he passed two weeks between life and death , even being anointed . While on a bed recovering , on 22 May 1888 he received news that slavery had been abolished in Brazil . With a weak voice and tears in his eyes , he said , " Great people ! Great people ! " Pedro II returned to Brazil and disembarked in Rio de Janeiro in August 1888 . The " whole country welcomed him with an enthusiasm never seen before . From the capital , from the provinces , from everywhere , arrived proofs of affection and veneration . " With the devotion expressed by Brazilians upon the return of the Emperor and the Empress from Europe , the monarchy seemed to enjoy unshakable support and to be at the height of its popularity . 
 The nation enjoyed great international prestige during the final years of the Empire , and it had become an emerging power within the international arena . Predictions of economic and labor disruption caused by the abolition of slavery failed to materialize and the 1888 coffee harvest was successful . The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political , economic and social power in the country . Republicanism was an elitist creed which never flourished in Brazil , with little support in the provinces . The combination of republican ideas and the dissemination of Positivism among the army 's lower and medium officer ranks led to indiscipline among the corps and became a serious threat to the monarchy . They dreamed of a dictatorial republic , which they believed would be superior to the monarchy . 
 Although there was no desire in Brazil among the majority of the population to change the form of government , the civilian republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy . They launched a coup d 'état , arrested Prime Minister Afonso Celso , Viscount of Ouro Preto and instituted the republic on 15 November 1889 . The few people who witnessed what occurred did not realize that it was a rebellion . Historian <unk> Besouchet noted that " [ r ] arely has a revolution been so minor . " During the ordeal Pedro II showed no emotion , as if unconcerned about the outcome . He dismissed all suggestions for quelling the rebellion that politicians and military leaders put forward . When he heard the news of his deposition he simply commented : " If it is so , it will be my retirement . I have worked too hard and I am tired . I will go rest then . " He and his family were sent into exile in Europe on 17 November . 
 = = Exile and legacy = = 
 = = = Last years = = = 
 Teresa Cristina died three weeks after their arrival in Europe , and Isabel and her family moved to another place while Pedro settled first in Cannes and later in Paris . Pedro 's last couple of years were lonely and melancholic , as he lived in modest hotels without money and writing in his journal of dreams in which he was allowed to return to Brazil . He never supported a restoration of the monarchy , once stating that he had no desire " to return to the position which I occupied , especially not by means of conspiracy of any sort . " One day he caught an infection that progressed quickly into pneumonia . Pedro rapidly declined and died at 00 : 35 on 5 December 1891 surrounded by his family . His last words were " May God grant me these last wishes — peace and prosperity for Brazil " . While the body was being prepared , a sealed package in the room was found , and next to it a message written by the Emperor himself : " It is soil from my country , I wish it to be placed in my coffin in case I die away from my fatherland . " 
 Isabel wished to hold a discreet and private burial ceremony , but she eventually agreed to the French government 's request for a state funeral . On 9 December , thousands of mourners attended the ceremony at La Madeleine . Aside from Pedro 's family , these included : Francesco II , former king of the Two Sicilies ; Isabel II , former queen of Spain ; Philippe , comte de Paris ; and other members of European royalty . Also present were General Joseph <unk> , representing President Sadi Carnot ; the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies as well as their members ; diplomats ; and other representatives of the French government . Nearly all members of the Institut de France were in attendance . Other governments from the Americas and Europe sent representatives , as did distant countries such as Ottoman Turkey , China , Japan and Persia . Following the services , the coffin was taken in procession to the train station to begin its trip to Portugal . Around 300 @,@ 000 people lined the route under incessant rain and cold . The journey continued on to the Church of São Vicente de Fora near Lisbon , where the body of Pedro was interred in the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza on 12 December . 
 The Brazilian republican government , " fearful of a backlash resulting from the death of the Emperor " , banned any official reaction . Nevertheless , the Brazilians were far from indifferent to Pedro 's demise , and " repercussions in Brazil were also immense , despite the government 's effort to suppress . There were demonstrations of sorrow throughout the country : shuttered business activity , flags displayed at half @-@ staff , black armbands on clothes , death <unk> , religious ceremonies . " Masses were held in memory of Pedro throughout Brazil , and he and the monarchy were praised in the eulogies that followed . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 After his fall , Brazilians remained attached to the former Emperor , who was still a popular and highly praised figure . This view was even stronger among those of African descent , who equated the monarchy with freedom because of his and his daughter Isabel 's part in the abolition of slavery . The continued support for the deposed monarch is largely credited to a generally held and <unk> belief that he was a truly " wise , benevolent , austere and honest ruler " , said historian Ricardo Salles . The positive view of Pedro II , and nostalgia for his reign , only grew as the nation quickly fell into a series of economic and political crises which Brazilians attributed to the Emperor 's overthrow . 
 Strong feelings of guilt manifested among republicans , and these became increasingly evident upon the Emperor 's death in exile . They praised Pedro II , who was seen as a model of republican ideals , and the imperial era , which they believed should be regarded as an example to be followed by the young republic . In Brazil , the news of the Emperor 's death " aroused a genuine sense of regret among those who , without sympathy for a restoration , acknowledged both the merits and the achievements of their deceased ruler . " His remains , as well as those of his wife , were returned to Brazil in 1921 in time for the centenary of the Brazilian independence . The government granted Pedro II dignities befitting a head of state . A national holiday was declared and the return of the Emperor as a national hero was celebrated throughout the country . Thousands attended the main ceremony in Rio de Janeiro where , according to historian Pedro Calmon , the " elderly people cried . Many knelt down . All clapped hands . There was no distinction between republicans and monarchists . They were all Brazilians . " This homage marked the reconciliation of Republican Brazil with its monarchical past . 
 Historians have expressed high regard for Pedro II and his reign . The scholarly literature dealing with him is vast and , with the exception of the period immediately after his ouster , overwhelmingly positive , and even laudatory . He has been regarded by several historians in Brazil as the greatest Brazilian . In a manner similar to methods which were used by republicans , historians point to the Emperor 's virtues as an example to be followed , although none go so far as to advocate a restoration of the monarchy . Historian Richard Graham noted that " [ m ] ost twentieth @-@ century historians , moreover , have looked back on the period [ of Pedro II 's reign ] nostalgically , using their descriptions of the Empire to criticize — sometimes subtly , sometimes not — Brazil 's subsequent republican or dictatorial regimes .

 HD 40307 d is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star HD 40307 , located 42 light @-@ years from Earth in the direction of the southern constellation Pictor . The planet was discovered by the radial velocity method , using the HARPS apparatus in June 2008 . It is the most massive of the six proposed planets in the system . The planet is of interest as this star has relatively low metallicity , supporting a hypothesis that different metallicities in protostars determine what kind of planets they will form . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 HD 40307 d was discovered through the Doppler spectroscopy method , which functions by measuring the variations in radial velocity in a star produced by the gravitational effect of orbiting exoplanets . The radial velocities were measured by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher spectrography system ( HARPS ) at the La Silla Observatory in Chile 's Atacama Desert . The other less massive planets orbiting HD 40307 were discovered in the same way : HD 40307 b and HD 40307 c first , and then HD 40307 e , HD 40307 f , and HD 40307 g . The discovery of HD 40307 d and the former two was announced at the astrophysics conference that took place on June 16 – 18 , 2008 in Nantes , France . 
 = = Orbit and mass = = 
 HD 40307 d has a mass of at least 9 @.@ 2 times Earth 's ; assuming that all planets in the system have coplanar orbits , it is the most massive planet known in the system . The planet orbits approximately 0 @.@ 135 astronomical units from its primary star , as compared to Earth 's orbit at approximately one astronomical unit away from the Sun . As a result , one year on HD 40307 d constitutes approximately 20 @.@ 45 Earth days . The eccentricity of the planet 's orbit was found to not differ significantly from zero , meaning that there is insufficient data to distinguish the orbit from an entirely circular one . 
 The star around which HD 40307 d orbits has an unusually low metallicity compared to that of other planet @-@ bearing stars . This supports a hypothesis concerning the possibility that the metallicity of stars during their births may determine whether a protostar 's accretion disk forms gas giants or terrestrial planets . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The planet has not been found to transit and , further , it is not likely to . It has also not been imaged . More specific physical characteristics such as radius , composition , and average surface temperature cannot be observed . 
 A dynamical study of planets b , c , and d showed tidal effects at least on b and c , to the extent that b had to be a sub @-@ Neptune . All the planets from b to at least f must have migrated inward . That study implied that d was a sub @-@ Neptune as well . 
 As such strong tidal forces often result in the destruction of larger natural satellites in planets orbiting close to a star , it is unlikely that HD 40307 d hosts any satellites . 
 = Phallus hadriani = 
 Phallus hadriani , commonly known as the dune stinkhorn , is a species of fungus in the Phallaceae ( stinkhorn ) family . It is a widely distributed species , and is native to Asia , Europe , and North America . In Australia , it is probably an introduced species . The stalk of the fruit body reaches up to 20 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) tall by 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick , and is spongy , fragile , and hollow . At the top of the stem is a ridged and pitted , thimble @-@ like cap over which is spread olive @-@ colored spore slime ( gleba ) . Shortly after emerging , the gleba liquefies and releases a fetid odor that attracts insects , which help disperse the spores . Said to be edible in its immature egg @-@ like stage , it typically grows in public lawns , yards and gardens , usually in sandy soils . Phallus hadriani may be distinguished from the similar P. impudicus ( the common stinkhorn ) by the presence of a pink or violet @-@ colored volva at the base of the stem , and by differences in odor . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described scientifically by the French botanist Étienne Pierre Ventenat in 1798 , and sanctioned by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon under that name in his 1801 Synopsis Methodica Fungorum . Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck called the species Hymenophallus hadriani in 1817 ; this name is a synonym . According to the taxonomical database Index Fungorum , additional synonyms include : Phallus <unk> , named by Berkeley in 1836 ; Phallus imperialis , <unk> , 1873 ; Ithyphallus impudicus var. imperialis and Ithyphallus impudicus var. <unk> , De Toni , date unknown . 
 The specific epithet hadriani is named after the Dutch botanist <unk> Junius ( 1512 – 1575 ) , who wrote a pamphlet on stinkhorn mushrooms in 1564 ( <unk> , ex fungorum genere , in Hollandiae ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The immature fruiting bodies of P. hadriani in the egg stage have dimensions of 4 to 6 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 4 in ) by 3 to 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 6 in ) , and are colored rosy @-@ pink to violet . They typically have rhizomorphs ( aggregations of mycelium that resemble plant roots ) at the base . The eggs are enclosed in a tough covering and a gelatinous layer that breaks down as the stinkhorn emerges . Mature fruiting bodies , which may be 10 to 20 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 to 7 @.@ 9 in ) tall by 3 to 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick , have a white- or cream @-@ colored hollow stipe that is spongy and honeycombed . The head is reticulate , ridged and pitted , and covered with olive green glebal mass . The volva is cuplike , and typically retains its pink color although it may turn brownish with age . Fruit bodies are short @-@ lived , typically lasting only one or two days . 
 Although the odor of P. hadriani has been described by some authors as faint and pleasant or like violets , others describe the smell as fetid or putrid . The gleba is known to attract insects , including flies , bees , and beetles , some of which consume the spore @-@ containing slime . It is thought that long @-@ distance spore dispersal is facilitated by these insects , who may deposit in their feces intact spores that survive the passage through the digestive tract . 
 The spores are cylindrical , smooth , and hyaline ( translucent ) , with dimensions of 3 – 4 by 1 – 2 µm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are cylindrical , with dimensions of 20 – 25 by 3 – 4 µm . They have eight sterigmata ( slender extensions that attach to the spores ) , as well as a clamp at their base . 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 Like many other stinkhorns , this species is thought to be edible when in its egg form . Central Europeans and the Chinese consider the eggs a delicacy . Regarding the edibility of mature specimens , one author commented on the genus in general , " No one with his sense of smell developed would think of eating the members of this group . " 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Phallus impudicus has the same overall appearance as P. hadriani , but is distinguished by its white volva . Another similar stinkhorn , P. ravenelii has a smooth , not reticulate head . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Phallus hadriani is known to be in Australia ( where it is thought to be an introduced species imported on woodchip mulch used in gardening and landscaping ) , North America , Europe ( including Denmark , Ireland , Latvia , The Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Slovakia , Sweden , Ukraine , and Wales ) Turkey ( Iğdır Province ) , Japan , and China ( Jilin Province ) . 
 Phallus hadriani is a saprobic species , and thus obtains nutrients by decomposing organic matter . In North America , it is commonly associated with tree stumps , or roots of stumps that are decomposing in the ground . In Great Britain , its distribution is more or less restricted to coastal dunes , while in Poland , it has been noted to avoid humid and humic forest soils , and live in symbiosis with <unk> grasses and the black locust tree , Robinia <unk> . The mushroom is one of three species protected by the Red Data Book of Latvia .

 Paciorek was born in Detroit on February 11 , 1945 . His father was a factory worker in Plymouth , Michigan . He was the oldest of eight children ; two of his brothers , Tom and Jim , went on to have MLB careers as well . He attended St. Ladislaus High School in Hamtramck , Michigan , and was named to the varsity baseball team as a freshman . During his high school career , he focused on strength building to achieve his dream of being a baseball player . By the time he graduated , he went from 119 pounds ( 54 kg ) to 200 pounds ( 91 kg ) , and was an all @-@ state three @-@ sport star in baseball , football , and basketball . Paciorek also played on Detroit 's team in the National Amateur Baseball Federation ; he was named most valuable player during the annual tournament in 1962 . While he was still in high school , Houston general manager Paul Richards convinced Paciorek to sign with the Colt .45s ; the two agreed to a $ 45 @,@ 000 contract . 
 = = Baseball career = = 
 In late 1962 , Paciorek attended an instructional league put on by Houston , which led to him becoming part of the team 's spring training roster as one of 63 invited players . During exhibition play , he " hit everything in sight " , and had a batting average of over .300 . After spring training ended , he began his professional career with the Modesto Colts of the California League and played in 78 games for the team with a .219 batting average and 15 doubles . Late in the season , he injured his back and shoulder ; he was diagnosed with a sciatic nerve injury , and was told to rest . Shortly afterward , however , Houston brought Paciorek and seven other rookies onto the major league roster to play in the season finale on September 29 . 
 Paciorek , who was the starting right fielder , began the day with a walk in the second inning . He then had a single in the fourth inning , which drove in Rusty Staub and Bob Aspromonte . After singling and again bringing home Aspromonte in the fifth , Paciorek had a walk in the sixth , and ended the day with a leadoff single in the eighth . In total , he went to the plate five times and hit three singles and had two walks , scoring four runs en route to a 12 – 4 Houston victory over the New York Mets . He had a perfect major league career batting average and on @-@ base percentage of 1 @.@ 000 as a result of his performance that day , something no one else with as many plate appearances as Paciorek has done . 
 Thanks in part to his performance in the final game of Houston 's season , Paciorek was invited to spring training for Houston in 1964 . His performances included a bases @-@ loaded triple against the Mets . However , his poor play on both offense and defense late in spring training led to him being cut despite being nearly a lock to make the roster . He spent part of the year on the Durham Bulls and Statesville Colts , where he had a <unk> batting average in 49 combined games . Partway through the year , he had spinal fusion surgery , which caused Paciorek to miss the rest of the 1964 season , as well as all of 1965 . 
 Paciorek returned to the Houston organization in 1966 , and split the season with the Batavia Trojans and Salisbury Astros , where he hit .193 in 77 combined games . The following year , he played for the Asheville Tourists and Cocoa Astros , had a <unk> average in 32 games , and was released at season 's end . He was given a second chance to return to the major leagues when the Cleveland Indians , who were scouting his brother Tom at the University of Houston , signed him to a minor league contract with a spring training invitation . He spent 1968 with the Single @-@ A Reno Silver Sox and the Rock Hill Indians , and hit .268 with 20 home runs in 95 total games ; his 17 home runs with Reno led the team . Paciorek was promoted the following year to the Double @-@ A Waterbury Indians and played in 29 games with them , but tore his achilles tendon during warm @-@ ups , which led to his release and the end of his professional career .

 After his baseball career ended , Paciorek returned to school and earned a degree in physical education from the University of Houston , a degree that he began to pursue while recovering from back surgery . While acquiring his degree , he became a Christian Scientist and married Linda Cupp . After graduating from college , he spent several years as an instructor at a Jewish community center , then became a physical education teacher after inquiring about a Christian Science Monitor advertisement for a teaching position at <unk> School in San Gabriel , California . Linda died of breast cancer in 1987 , and Paciorek married Karen Purdy two years later . Paciorek has four sons and four daughters . His nephew , Joey Paciorek , played in the Milwaukee Brewers minor league organization , and his sons , Pete and Mack , had minor league careers as well . While watching his son in training camp , Paciorek became an author after watching what he felt was improper instruction given to the players . He has since written two books , Plato & Socrates , Baseball 's <unk> Fans and The Principle of Baseball , and All There is to Know About Hitting . 
 = Suillus bovinus = 
 Suillus bovinus , also known as the Jersey cow mushroom or bovine bolete , is a pored mushroom of the genus Suillus in the family Suillaceae . A common fungus native to Europe and Asia , it has been introduced to North America and Australia . It was initially described as Boletus bovinus by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 , and given its current binomial name by Henri François Anne de Roussel in 1806 . It is an edible mushroom , though not highly regarded . 
 The fungus grows in coniferous forests in its native range , and pine plantations in countries where it has become naturalised . It forms symbiotic ectomycorrhizal associations with living trees by enveloping the tree 's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue , and is sometimes parasitised by the related mushroom Gomphidius roseus . Suillus bovinus produces spore @-@ bearing fruit bodies , often in large numbers , above ground . The mushroom has a convex grey @-@ yellow or ochre cap reaching up to 10 cm ( 4 in ) in diameter , which flattens with age . Like other boletes , it has tubes extending downward from the underside of the cap , rather than gills ; spores escape at maturity through the tube openings , or pores . The pore surface is yellow . The stipe , more slender than those of other Suillus boletes , lacks a ring . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 Suillus bovinus was one of the many species first described in 1753 by the " father of taxonomy " Carl Linnaeus , who , in the second volume of his Species Plantarum , gave it the name Boletus bovinus . The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word bos , meaning " cattle " . The fungus was reclassified in ( and became the type species of ) the genus Suillus by French naturalist Henri François Anne de Roussel in 1796 . Suillus is an ancient term for fungi , and is derived from the word " swine " . Lucien Quélet classified it as Viscipellis bovina in 1886 . 
 In works published before 1987 , the species was written fully as Suillus bovinus ( L. : Fr . ) Kuntze , as the description by Linnaeus had been name sanctioned in 1821 by the " father of mycology " , Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries . The starting date for all the mycota had been set by general agreement as 1 January 1821 , the date of Fries 's work . Furthermore , as Roussel 's description of Suillus predated this as well , the authority for the genus was assigned to Otto Kuntze . The 1987 edition of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature changed the rules on the starting date and primary work for names of fungi , and names can now be considered valid as far back as 1 May 1753 , the date of publication of Linnaeus 's work . 
 Common names include Jersey cow mushroom , bovine bolete , and euro cow bolete . One proposed origin for the scientific name is that medieval knights — who revered Tricholoma equestre — considered this mushroom fit only for cattle @-@ drovers as it was not highly valued . 
 A limited genetic sampling of species in a 1996 study by Annette <unk> and colleagues showed Suillus bovinus was related to a lineage that diverged to S. punctipes , S. variegatus and S. tomentosus . A 2001 study found it was not closely related to other European species , and that all populations tested were more closer to each other than any other and hence it was a cohesive species . 
 Czech mycologist Josef Šutara circumscribed the genus Mariaella in 1987 , assigning Mariaella bovina as the type species . Mariaella contained Suillus species in section <unk> . Molecular studies do not support the existence of Mariaella , and so it is considered synonymous with Suillus . Older synonyms for S. bovinus include those resulting from generic transfers to Agaricus by Jean @-@ Baptiste Lamarck in 1783 , and the now @-@ obsolete Ixocomus by Lucien Quélet in 1888 . 
 In 1951 , Arthur Anselm Pearson described the variety Boletus bovinus var. <unk> , which was later transferred to Suillus by Rolf Singer in 1961 . This variant , collected in Western Cape Province , South Africa , differs from the main form by the staining reaction of the cap flesh , which turns dark or light greenish @-@ blue upon injury . Index Fungorum does not , however , recognise the variety as having independent taxonomic significance . 
 Chemical analysis of pigments and <unk> showed that Suillus was more closely related to Gomphidius and Rhizopogon than to other boletes , and hence Suillus bovinus and its allies were transferred from the Boletaceae to the newly circumscribed family Suillaceae in 1997 . Molecular studies have reinforced how distantly related these fungi are from Boletus edulis and its allies .

 The fruit body — colloquially called a mushroom — of Suillus bovinus is smaller and <unk> than most other boletes . The cap is initially convex , then flat with a wavy margin and a grey @-@ yellow or ochre with pink tinge in some specimens . It ranges from 3 – 10 cm ( 1 1 ⁄ 4 – 4 in ) in diameter and has a sticky skin . The flesh is whitish , yellowish or clay @-@ coloured and has a fruity smell . Sometimes turning a pink tinge when bruised , the flesh is spongy and rubbery . Like other boletes , it has pores instead of gills that make up the hymenophore on the underside of the cap . Suillus bovinus has a characteristic compound pore layer , consisting of an outer layer of coarse , angular pores overlaying an inner layer of finer pores . The pores are <unk> to olive @-@ yellow and generally decurrent , comprising yellow to olive @-@ yellow tubes that measure 0 @.@ 3 – 1 cm ( 1 ⁄ 8 – 3 ⁄ 8 in ) long . The 4 – 6 cm ( 1 1 ⁄ 2 – 2 1 ⁄ 4 in ) tall stipe , similar in colour to the cap , tends to be narrower towards the base . With a diameter of 0 @.@ 5 – 0 @.@ 8 cm ( 1 ⁄ 4 – 3 ⁄ 8 in ) , it is more slender than those of other boletes . 
 The spore print is an olive @-@ brown colour . The oval to spindle @-@ shaped spores have dimensions of 8 – 10 by 3 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 5 μm . Basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are cylindrical to narrowly club @-@ shaped , measuring 22 @.@ 4 – 33 @.@ 4 by 5 @.@ 8 – 8 @.@ 0 μm . They bear four sterigmata ( each holding a single spore ) , which are up to 6 @.@ 8 μm long . Cystidia are present on both the tube ends ( cheilocystidia ) and tube faces ( pleurocystidia ) . There are no clamp connections in the hyphae of Suillus bovinus . The cap cuticle comprises filamentous , gelatinized hyphae with a diameter of 2 @.@ 6 – 5 @.@ 0 μm . The mycelium has a pink tinge . 
 The distinctive colour of the cap and pores make it hard to confuse with other species . Often found in similar habitats is S. variegatus , though this species has a granular cap and dark olive pores , which are smaller and not decurrent . It can also bruise blue . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Suillus bovinus is found in conifer woods and plantations across Europe , including subalpine regions in the Alps , up to altitudes of 800 m ( 2500 ft ) . It is common in Lithuania , where it associates with Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) , the only naturally occurring pine in that country . Preferred soils of S. bovinus are often acidic , sand @-@ based , or sometimes calcareous ( chalky ) and moraine . In Asia , it has been recorded in Taiwan , and in Japan , where it associates with Japanese red pine ( Pinus densiflora ) . In China , it has been recorded from provinces Anhui , Fujian , Guangdong , Hunan , Jiangxi , and Zhejiang . 
 Suillus bovinus has been introduced into other areas . In North America , where it is thought to have been introduced with Scots pine , it is found in the eastern United States , including North Carolina , Pennsylvania , Vermont , and the Adirondack Mountains of New York . It has been recorded infrequently under Scots pine in Australia , where it has been found as far north as southern Queensland , and in more southerly locations including New South Wales and <unk> Forest . It is absent from New Zealand . In South Africa , it grows with Pinus radiata . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Suillus bovinus is mycorrhizal , forming symbiotic associations with living trees by enveloping the tree 's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue . Field work in pine forests in Sweden analysing the population structure of Suillus bovinus found that mushrooms were more abundant in younger forests and forests with disturbed areas , which contained a higher number of genets ( colonies ) — 700 to 5700 per hectare — compared with 30 to 120 genets per hectare in mature stands . Older colonies in mature forests could be 17 @.@ 5 m ( 57 1 ⁄ 2 ft ) in diameter against 1 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 3 m ( 5 1 ⁄ 2 – 17 1 ⁄ 2 ft ) diameter in young forests . Spore @-@ bearing mushrooms ( sporocarps ) produce a huge number of spores ( estimated in a Finnish study at 240 million to 1 @.@ 2 billion per mushroom ) , of which only a small number grow successfully ; this large number is thought to explain the larger numbers of colonies in disturbed and young forests , while the fungus ' vegetative spread becomes more important in established forests . Colonies of S. bovinus do not overlap , which indicates they suppress each other 's growth . The median lifespan of a colony was estimated to be 36 years . Field work conducted in Swedish pine forests suggested that S. variegatus suppressed the growth of S. bovinus , as there was a negative correlation in occurrence . 
 A Finnish study published in 1997 found that bacterial communities under P. sylvestris without mycorrhizae metabolised organic and amino acids , while communities among S. bovinus metabolised mannitol , a sugar alcohol . The mycelia also extended the environment in the soil that the bacteria were able to grow in . An experimental study in Portugal showed that Pinus pinaster trees grew better after being inoculated with mycelium from S. bovinus , <unk> <unk> and Lactarius deterrimus and spores of Pisolithus tinctorius and Scleroderma citrinum . These fungi were proposed as an alternative for chemical fertiliser in <unk> of pine trees . Suillus bovinus has been shown to improve the tolerance of its host Pinus sylvestris to metal pollutants such as cadmium and zinc , though not to hazardous organic compounds such as m @-@ <unk> . 
 Experimental work in 1986 showed that Suillus bovinus could metabolise proteins and peptides directly , causing a drop in nitrogen in growth media , which suggested the species has some saprophytic activity . 
 The related rosy spike @-@ cap ( Gomphidius roseus ) is found exclusively with this species , and is now thought to be parasitic upon the mycelium of Suillus bovinus . This is evidenced by microscopic examination , which shows that G. roseus inserts <unk> in plant root cells and does not produce significant mycelium itself . Furthermore , G. roseus is never found growing in isolation , only with S. bovinus though the latter species is found without the former . <unk> fulva is a yellow mould that has been found growing on decaying S. bovinus fruit bodies in Europe and the United States . 
 = = Edibility = = 
 Suillus bovinus tastes mild and is edible , although it is not highly regarded . When cooked , it releases a lot of fluid , which can be collected and reduced or strained to make a sauce . Its flavour is made more intense by drying . The soft and rubbery consistency of older specimens — as well as their proneness to maggot infestation — renders them almost inedible . Fruit bodies are part of the later summer diet of the red squirrel in Eurasia , which collect the mushrooms and store them in tree forks for a ready food supply after the onset of frost . There are several fly species that often use S. bovinus fruit bodies to rear their young , including <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Pegomya <unk> , and <unk> silvatica . 
 = Port of Split = 
 The Port of Split ( Croatian : Luka Split ) is a port in the central Dalmatian city of Split , Croatia . The port was originally a trading post originally established by Greek settlers from the island of Vis and subsequently taken over by the Romans . The port thrived through the Middle Ages , but it suffered a decline in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when the Port of Rijeka took over as the primary trading and shipping outlet of the region . The decline was also attributed to the decline of the Ottoman Empire , a traditional market for the Port of Split , and the growing domination of Austrian Empire . 
 As of 2011 , the port ranks as the largest passenger port in Croatia and the third largest passenger port in the Mediterranean , with annual passenger volume of approximately 4 million . By 2010 , the Port of Split recorded 18 @,@ 000 ship arrivals each year . The port is managed by the Port of Split Authority ( PSA ) . In the late 2000s , the PSA and the port operators , <unk> Luka Split d.d. and Luka d.d. Split , started to implement an investment plan aimed at increasing both passenger and cargo traffic volume , scheduled to be completed by 2015 , which would allow the port to handle up to 7 million passengers per year .

 = = History = = 
 The first trading post at the site of the Port of Split was <unk> , established by Greek settlers from the island of Vis in the 4th century BC . Position of the trading post was selected because of its location in a natural harbor and its proximity to numerous Adriatic Sea islands and extensive hinterland populated by Illyrians , most notably in Salona . The area subsequently became a part of the Roman Empire , and after its Decline of the Roman Empire , the coast was brought under rule of the Byzantine Empire , until the area was absorbed into the Kingdom of Croatia in the beginning of the 10th century . In 1102 , Croatia and Kingdom of Hungary were joined in a personal union . By the 12th century , Split had developed trading routes with its hinterland and maritime trade throughout the Adriatic Sea and the Mediterranean . The Republic of Venice of gained full control of Dalmatia and the city of Split by 1428 . In the 16th century , Split was the central maritime trade outlet of the Balkans , where goods were transported from the Ottoman Empire , India and Persia to the Venetian Republic and vice versa . After the fall of Venice , Split was briefly ruled by the Habsburg Monarchy and Austrian Empire between 1797 and 1806 , and the First French Empire until 1813 when Austrian rule was restored . In that period , trade routes shifted to other Adriatic ports , especially the Port of Rijeka , causing a downturn in the city 's economy . 
 In the second half of the 19th century , the economy of the city of Split and its surrounding area started to recover and Split soon became hub of the central Dalmatia , connecting the hinterland and the neighboring islands . This spurred development of the city port and its transport connections , including construction of a new breakwater and the Split – Knin railway . In 1925 , the railway was linked to the Rijeka – Zagreb railway via Gospić , allowing development of a modern port . Since 1957 , cargo terminals of the Port of Split were relocated from the city centre to industrial zones in Solin and Kaštela areas , while passenger traffic still uses the centrally positioned harbor .

 After 50 Cent was discovered by rapper Eminem in 2002 , he flew to Los Angeles where he was introduced to record producer Dr. Dre . " In da Club " was the first of seven tracks he recorded in five days with Dr. Dre . 50 Cent described the studio sessions , saying : 
 Dre , he 'll play dope beats ... [ He 'll say ] , ' These are the hits , 50 . So pick one of these and make a couple of singles or something . ' The very first time he heard [ me rap on ] ' In Da Club ' he said , ' Yo , I didn 't think you was going to go there with it , but , you know , it works . ' He was probably thinking of going in a different direction with that song . Then he expanded it into a hit record . 
 The production was originally given to the hip hop group D12 , but was passed on to 50 Cent because the group did not know how to approach the song . He recorded the track with only the drum beat present . Since much of the content on Get Rich or Die Tryin ' was " dark " , he wanted to write material that was " the exact opposite " . He called the song a " celebration of life . Every day it 's relevant all over ' cause every day is someone 's birthday . "

The video also contains a shooting range , which Atwell felt was appropriate because 50 Cent had been shot nine times . He said , " creatively , I felt like we were able to put guns in a video and have it play . And I like it when you are able to play within the standards and still give the artist something symbolic of what they are going for . " 
 The video ends with the camera zooming out of the club to reveal a two @-@ way mirror with Eminem and Dr. Dre in white lab uniforms , observing 50 Cent and taking notes . Atwell stated that " seeing 50 with Dre and Em having his back is as big a visual statement as it is a musical statement " and the shot was significant because it made clear the club was inside the center and not unrelated performance footage . On January 27 , 2003 , the video debuted on MTV 's Total Request Live at number nine and stayed on the chart for fifty days . It also reached number one on the MuchMusic video charts . At the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards , the video was awarded Best Rap Video and Best New Artist and was nominated for Video of the Year , Best Male Video , and Viewer 's Choice . Cameos include : Dr. Dre , Eminem , D12 , Lloyd Banks , Tony Yayo , Game ( in his first cameo appearance ) , Bang ' Em Smurf , Young Buck , Xzibit and DJ Whoo Kid .

 In January 2006 , 50 Cent was sued for copyright infringement by former 2 Live Crew manager Joseph Weinberger , who owns the rights to the rap group 's catalog . He claimed that 50 Cent plagiarized the lines " it 's your birthday " from the eponymous second track of former 2 Live Crew frontman Luther Campbell 's 1994 album Freak for Life 6996 ( also known simply as Freak for Life ) . The lawsuit was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Paul Huck , who ruled that the phrase was a " common , unoriginal and <unk> element of the song " .

 In 2003 , American recording artist Beyoncé recorded a remix version of " In da Club " titled " Sexy Lil Thug " . Her version sampled the original 's instrumental and melody with the singer singing her own , newly added verses . In the song , she references Jimmy Choo shoes , Marilyn Monroe , Marc Jacobs , and Bailey Bank and Biddle . <unk> B. Selah of The Village Voice said , " Her version of ' In da Club ' outed 50 Cent as a singing @-@ ass rapper with lines like ' Don 't wanna be your girl / I ain 't lookin ' for no love / So come give me a hug / You a sexy little thug . ' " Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle coined Beyoncé 's cover version as a " female spin " on the original . The song was officially released on Beyoncé 's mixtape Speak My Mind . According to Guerra of the Houston Chronicle , the song was never an official single , likely because of permission issues . Beyoncé 's version of the song charted for 7 weeks and peaked at number 67 on the US Billboard Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs chart . In 2013 , Mike Wass of the website Idolator put " Sexy Lil Thug " at number six on his list of " Beyonce 's 10 Best Unreleased And Rare Tracks " . He described it as a " radio staple " in 2003 , adding that it " remains something of a lost gem " and concluded " Queen Bey spit iconic lyrics like ' I ’ m that classy <unk> with the Marilyn Monroe body ' " .

 = Master Chief ( Halo ) = 
 <unk> John @-@ 117 , or " Master Chief " , is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Halo fictional universe created by Bungie . Master Chief is a playable character in the series of science fiction first @-@ person shooter video games Halo : Combat Evolved , Halo 2 , Halo 3 , Halo 4 , and Halo 5 : Guardians . Outside video games , the character appears in books and graphic novels — Halo : The Fall of Reach , Halo : The Flood , Halo : First Strike , and Halo : Uprising — and has cameos in other Halo media , including Halo : Reach , Halo : Ghosts of Onyx , The Halo Graphic Novel , Halo Legends and Halo 4 : Forward Unto Dawn . 
 The Master Chief is a towering and faceless biochemically and cybernetically @-@ enhanced supersoldier , raised and trained from an early age to be a weapon ; he is almost never seen without his green @-@ colored armor and helmet . He is commonly referred to by his naval rank , rather than his given birth @-@ name or serial @-@ designation . The character is voiced by Steve Downes , a Chicago disc jockey , in the video games in which he appears . Downes based his personification of the Chief on an initial character sketch which called for a Clint Eastwood @-@ type character of few words . 
 The Master Chief is a video game icon , a relative newcomer among more established franchise characters , such as Mario , Sonic the Hedgehog and Lara Croft . The character has received a mostly positive reception . While some have described the Chief 's silent and faceless nature as a weakness of the character , other publications have suggested these attributes better allows players to assume his role . 
 = = Character design = = 
 The task of developing Master Chief for the character 's first appearance in Halo : Combat Evolved fell on Rob McLees and the project 's art director , Marcus Lehto . Eventually , Shi Kai Wang was hired for conceptual art . One of Wang 's sketches was accepted and became the basis for the Master Chief ; however , after Wang 's version was converted to a 3 @-@ D model , it was decided the character looked too slender , " almost effeminate " . The Master Chief was subsequently bulked up to the version currently found in the games . Similarly , the Chief 's armor went through various changes , such as the addition of an antenna , which was removed later in development , and a green tint . 
 In an interview on creating believable video game characters , Bungie 's Joseph Staten noted that , " Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity , " he said , " in terms of how people react to him . He 's a space Marine in really cool green armor . " The character 's perspective changed as the game itself changed from a real @-@ time strategy game to a first @-@ person shooter , but the Chief was always intended to be a soldier in the last part of a long and bitter war . For much of the game 's development , the character had no name . The developers spent time considering what rank and branch of the armed forces the Chief would belong to — naval ranks grabbed them as " different " from ones the developers had heard of before . " Master Chief " was intended to be a placeholder while a real name was finalized , but the moniker stuck . 
 Downes , who voices the Master Chief , is a disc jockey and voice actor who had never played video games before Halo . Downes only previous experience with video game voice work was a small part for Septerra Core : Legacy of the Creator . During production of Halo , Martin O 'Donnell , Bungie 's music director , recommended Downes for the part of the Chief based on his experience working on Septerra . Downes never interviewed for the part , describing his acceptance as " a phone call " . For years Downes never appeared at Bungie or Microsoft events and believed that the Master Chief is left masked because " [ the character 's identity ] is really in the eye of the player " . 
 = = Attributes = = 
 = = = Personality = = = 
 Downes said that his voicing for Master Chief was based entirely on Bungie 's written character description provided , which specified a character similar to Clint Eastwood and of few words . In a podcast interview , the actor noted that , during the recording , he was given a fair amount of creative leeway to develop the Chief 's personality . In the games , Master Chief never speaks during player @-@ controlled gameplay , making him an almost silent protagonist . Even during cut scenes , the character generally speaks sparingly . Bungie Studios ' Frank O 'Connor has described the Chief as " so quiet and so invisible , literally , that the player gets to pretend they 're the Chief . The player gets to inhabit those shoes [ and ] apply their own personality . " Bungie concept artist Eddie Smith described Master Chief as " pretty much the consummate professional . He does his job , walks off , doesn 't even get the girl , he 's that cool he doesn 't need her . " Although the Master Chief is usually depicted as calm , quiet , and wryly cynical , some reviewers stated that Eric Nylund 's portrayal of the character in Halo : The Fall of Reach deviates significantly from the treatment found in the games and other media . Alternatively , William C. Dietz 's portrayal of the Chief in Halo : The Flood was occasionally blasted by fans as too radical a departure from Nylund 's template . 
 Initially , the very existence of the SPARTAN project and thus John 's existence , was categorised as classified information . Many within the United Nations Space Command ( UNSC ) , who were aware of this information , were strongly opinionated against the project , as the SPARTAN unit 's proven versatility elevated them into direct competition with role @-@ dedicated , established units . Since John emerged as the most exemplary Spartan from among the unit , he became the natural target of their sentiments . Antonio Silva , an officer from one such unit ( ODSTs ) , exemplifies this attitude , and considers the Master Chief the freak product of an experiment that should never be repeated . Although the Chief resents Silva 's dishonor to his fallen comrades ' memory , he is also loyal to the chain of command , and remains quiet . Following the partial declassification of the SPARTAN project , John 's heroic achievements caused the overall sentiment to lean in his favor . Despite these explorations of the character 's personality , O 'Connor said in an interview that revealing the face of the Chief is not as important as revealing the events going on around the character . 
 The Master Chief has a close relationship with the artificial intelligence construct Cortana , whom he meets just prior to the fall of the human colony Reach before the events of Combat Evolved . Cortana was created as a game design requirement to guide the character as Master Chief throughout the game world , but she became an important aspect of revealing the Chief 's humanity . " Over time , Cortana became a fully realized character — a friend and companion to the Chief , not to mention the only person to poke revealing holes in his tough @-@ guy exterior , " Staten recalled . The game designers also crafted the player experience of the first game to focus on abandonment and loneliness in many levels , as it reinforced the plot point that many of the Chief 's friends were killed before the game began . 
 = = = Outward appearance = = = 
 In the video games , the Master Chief is rarely seen without his armor . In @-@ game cutscenes tease the character 's face , but never reveal it ; for example , at the end of Halo : Combat Evolved , the Chief removes his helmet , but camera movement hides his head . Bungie says this helps the gamer fully assume his character . At the end of Halo 4 , Master Chief 's eyes are briefly shown when he removes his armor and helmet . One physical description of the adult Master Chief comes from the novels . During a briefing scene in Halo : The Flood , the Chief is described as tall with short hair , serious eyes , and strong features . His skin is " too white " , a consequence of spending most of his time in his armor . The Master Chief stands about seven feet ( 2 @.@ 13 m ) tall and weighs 1 @,@ 000 pounds ( 450 kg ) in armor ; without it , he stands six feet , seven inches ( 2 m ) tall and weighs 287 pounds ( 130 kg ) .

 The Master Chief 's backstory is never explained in the games . A prequel of Halo : Combat Evolved , the 2001 novel The Fall of Reach , reveals much of the character 's history and was released as a companion to the game . Master Chief , originally named John , was born in 2511 and first lived with his family on the human colony planet Eridanus II . Large for his six years of age , and approximately a foot above his school peers , he is described as a typical boy with brown hair , freckles and a gap between his two front teeth . In 2517 , John and dozens of children his age are covertly taken from their homes and replaced with clones to hide the kidnapping . The original children are brought to the planet Reach , one of the UNSC 's bastions , to begin intense physical and psychological training to become " Spartan @-@ II " supersoldiers . They are assigned new identification numbers instead of last names ; John becomes known as John @-@ 117 . Approximately eight years later , John and the other children are biologically and cybernetically augmented and enhanced . These procedures have substantial risks ; only John and thirty @-@ two other Spartans survive . 
 After the Spartans ' first successful operation , John @-@ 117 is briefed on the threat posed by the Covenant , a theocratic alliance of alien races , and witnesses the utter devastation wrought by a single ship . In 2552 , the Chief and Spartans return to Reach , where the UNSC High Command has developed a last @-@ ditch plan to capture a Covenant High Prophet , who they hope could be used in order to barter a truce . The Master Chief 's armor is upgraded , and he first encounters the artificial intelligence ( AI ) Cortana during a training mission . The Covenant arrive and invade , despite the best efforts of the Spartans and other UNSC forces . Aboard the spaceship Pillar of Autumn , Cortana plots a random course of escape . Seemingly the last Spartan alive , the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep along with the Pillar of Autumn 's crew . 
 = = = Halo : Combat Evolved = = = 
 Master Chief first appears in the games as the protagonist of Halo : Combat Evolved and the 2003 novelization , Halo : The Flood . During the opening cinematic of Halo : Combat Evolved , the Chief is awakened from cryonic sleep . Upon exiting slipspace , the Pillar of Autumn is attacked by the Covenant and crash lands on Halo , a ring @-@ shaped megastructure . Master Chief escapes the ship via an escape pod . Upon landing on Halo , his first task is to find other survivors . While fighting the Covenant , Master Chief and Cortana learn that Halo was created by an ancient race , the Forerunners , as a last line of defense against an alien parasite called the Flood . The Covenant accidentally release the Flood , which begins to spread across the ring . At the request of the installation 's resident AI 343 Guilty Spark , Master Chief retrieves the Index , a device used to activate Halo 's defenses and eliminate the Flood . However , Guilty Spark neglects to inform the Master Chief that Halo would accomplish this by destroying all sentient life in a vast radius , essentially starving the Flood to death . Cortana intervenes to prevent the activation of Halo . She and the Master Chief destroy it by detonating the Pillar of Autumn 's fusion reactor core . The Master Chief and Cortana escape in a <unk> spacecraft , believing they are the only survivors . 
 = = = First Strike and Halo 2 = = = 
 Halo : First Strike , the 2003 novel by Eric Nylund , follows the Master Chief after the events of Halo : Combat Evolved and bridges the events of Halo and Halo 2 . Floating in Halo 's debris field , Cortana and the Chief discover that there are in fact other human survivors . The Master Chief and these soldiers capture the Covenant flagship Ascendant Justice , and return to Reach to save any UNSC survivors on the planet . At Reach , the Master Chief discovers that the Covenant had not destroyed the planet 's biosphere in the usual manner , and that a few other Spartans survive . The Chief retrieves Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey , the creative genius behind the SPARTAN @-@ II Project , and his fellow soldiers . The Spartans then attack a massive Covenant command station , the Unyielding Hierophant , thus delaying a Covenant assault on Earth . 
 The Master Chief returns as one of two playable characters in Halo 2 , the 2004 sequel to Halo : Combat Evolved . Returning to Earth with heavily damaged armor , the Master Chief receives an upgrade . Aboard Cairo Station in space , he attends a brief awards ceremony , which is interrupted by a Covenant invasion . Master Chief is commanded to protect the station . The Covenant is repelled , and the Master Chief joins the ship In Amber Clad to fight the Covenant on Earth 's surface , in New Mombasa . As the Covenant departs via slipspace , the In Amber Clad follows them to Installation 05 , another Halo . The Master Chief lands on this Halo and subsequently assassinates the Covenant High Prophet of Regret . Emerging from a structure , the Master Chief is attacked by orbiting Covenant forces , but is rescued by the Gravemind , an intelligence of Flood origin . The Gravemind sends him to High Charity to search for Delta Halo 's Index . Subsequently , the Master Chief boards a Forerunner ship bound for Earth , intending to " finish the fight " . 
 = = = Uprising and Halo 3 = = = 
 Back on Earth , the Master Chief helps to repel hostile Covenant forces from Mombasa , Kenya and Voi . With the Arbiter ( a Covenant Elite who has sided with humanity ) and fellow allies , the Chief leads the assault on a Forerunner artifact that the Covenant Prophet of Truth is attempting to activate . Soon after Truth escapes Earth through the slipspace portal opened by the artifact , the Flood lands on Earth . After helping to control the infestation , the Master Chief follows Truth to the Ark , an immense constructed world more than 262 @,@ 144 light @-@ years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy and well beyond the range of any Halo . There , all the Halos can be remotely activated , thus killing all sentient life that could be infested by the Flood . It is discovered that a new Halo is being constructed to replace the one that the Master Chief destroyed in Halo : Combat Evolved . The Flood follow the Chief to the Ark , bringing High Charity through the slipspace portal to escape the range of the six original Halos . The allied Elites and humans decide to activate the new Halo in order to kill the Flood outside the galaxy , and thus preserve life there . 343 Guilty Spark opposes the premature activation of the incomplete installation and attempts to stop it . Master Chief destroys him , activates the ring , and escapes with Cortana and the Arbiter on the UNSC frigate Forward Unto Dawn . During the escape , the collapsing slipspace portal severs the Dawn in two , stranding Cortana and the Master Chief deep in space . While the Arbiter returns to Earth , Cortana activates a distress beacon , knowing that rescue could take years ; the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep , telling Cortana , " Wake me , when you need me . " If the player finishes the last level on Legendary difficulty , a cutscene shows the severed half of the ship floating near an unknown planet . 
 = = = Halo 4 = = = 
 Master Chief awakens from the cryo @-@ pod he entered at the end of Halo 3 within the Forward Unto Dawn . The Covenant are invading the ship and Master Chief fights his way outside as the frigate crash lands on a Forerunner shield world . He survives the fall and awakens inside the shield world without serious injury . There , while fighting the shield world 's defensive AI which Cortana identifies as " Prometheans " , he encounters the Didact , an antagonistic Forerunner who plans on using a Forerunner artifact called The Composer to turn humanity into digital data . Master Chief manages to foil his plans by delivering a <unk> nuclear warhead inside the Didact 's ship and detonating it , while the increasingly rampant Cortana protects him with a hard light barrier before fading away leaving the Chief mourning her loss .

 During the events between Halo 4 and Halo 5 , Master Chief has reunited with and taken command of Blue Team , the last remaining known survivors of the SPARTAN @-@ II program since Halo : First Strike . By the events of Halo 5 , Master Chief has been known to execute countless military operations non @-@ stop without rest alongside Blue Team . Blue Team 's latest operation entailed the attempted retaking of an Office of Naval Intelligence facility on Argent Moon from Jul M <unk> 's Covenant remnant forces . During the operation , Master Chief comes into contact with what he believes to be Cortana , directed to go to Meridian . After sharing his findings with both Blue Team and the UNSC flagship Infinity after scuttling the station , Master Chief goes AWOL to investigate Meridian , with Blue Team following out of their lifelong loyalty to their team leader . Blue Team 's rogue actions attract the attention of Fireteam Osiris , a team of SPARTAN @-@ IV operatives led by Jameson Locke assigned with the purpose of returning them to custody . 
 Blue Team finds a dormant Guardian , an autonomous Forerunner ship . After a brief fight with Locke , Blue Team boards the ship and is transported to the Forerunner World of Genesis . Upon reaching Genesis , Blue Team learns that Cortana did not perish , but came across the Domain , a Forerunner computer network that serves as " the fountain of youth " for artificial intelligence . Suspicious about Cortana 's nature and aware of the damage Cortana had caused , Blue Team attempts to meet with Cortana in an attempt to return her back to the UNSC . Fireteam Osiris reaches Blue Team 's location and attempts to assist them , only for the two SPARTAN fireteams to get separated . After fighting through scores of Promethean forces , Master Chief attempts to negotiate with Cortana and asks her to return to the UNSC , only for Cortana to refuse and imprison Blue Team in a Forerunner prison called the Cryptum with the intent of preserving them while Cortana enforces a forced peace across the galaxy . Fireteam Osiris narrowly releases Blue Team from Cortana 's captivity , and reunites Blue Team with Dr. Catherine Halsey , the creator and surrogate mother of the SPARTAN @-@ IIs .

 The Master Chief has appeared or has been referenced several times in non @-@ canon media . He is mentioned several times in Rooster Teeth Productions ' Halo @-@ based machinima parody series Red vs. Blue . In the first episode of the series , <unk> , talking to teammate Simmons , says , " I signed up to fight some aliens . Next thing I know , Master Chief blows up the whole Covenant Armada , and I 'm stuck in the middle of nowhere , fighting a bunch of blue guys . " In the Halo Zune exclusive video titled " Turn On , Tune In , Zune Out " , Doc has a segment on his radio broadcast called " You 're not Master Chief , and that 's okay " . Team Ninja approached Bungie Studios and asked to use the Master Chief in their 2006 video game Dead or Alive 4 . Although the Chief could not be used due to storyline restrictions , Bungie 's interest in the idea resulted in the development of Nicole ( Spartan @-@ 458 ) . 
 Marketing for Halo 3 focused heavily on the character of the Master Chief , including " The Museum " , and appears in the subsequent video as part of a special advertisement series for Halo 3 entitled " Believe in a Hero " . The character appears outside Halo fandom and associated works ; a medieval variation of the Master Chief 's MJOLNIR armour appears in Fable II , as the suit of armour worn by a legendary hero named " Hal " . Hal 's Armour only appears as downloadable content . 
 Peter David 's graphic novel <unk> contains a cameo by the Master Chief " before he actually was [ the Chief ] . " The Master Chief appears as a main character in Marvel 's limited series Halo : Uprising , which ties together the events of Halo 2 and Halo 3 . The Master Chief appears in four episodes of the 2010 anime collection Halo Legends : " The Package " , " Origins " , " Homecoming " and " Odd One Out " . 
 Master Chief can be seen briefly at the end of the Halo : Reach campaign . When moving the right analog stick at the proper time during a cutscene , he can be seen in his cryo @-@ tube , ready to be revived at the beginning of Combat Evolved . 
 In 2008 , Neill Blomkamp , director of the delayed Halo film , said the film would have depicted the character as " the most important supporting cast member " because of his faceless nature . Instead , " other characters around him [ ... ] did most of the emotional heavy lifting " , with their story exploring their perception of the Chief .

 IGN saw in the Master Chief elements of Jon <unk> , a character in Christopher Rowley 's novel <unk> . Other reviewers have suggested that the name John @-@ 117 could be a Biblical reference . Michael Nitsche of the Georgia Institute of Technology found similarity to Gordon Freeman , the protagonist of Valve Corporation 's Half @-@ Life series of FPS video games : " [ Both characters ] are the independent , individualistic , and often lonely heroes that gain admiration by constantly proving their superiority ... in technology @-@ driven , hostile , often closed spaces " . 
 Roger Travis , associate professor of classics at the University of Connecticut , compared the Master Chief to the epic hero Aeneas , in that both superhuman characters save a civilization by defeating strong enemies in a martial setting . The audience is intended to identify with the protagonist similarly in both stories . Matthew Stover compared Halo to the Iliad , saying that both stories share the meta @-@ theme that " war is the crucible of character " . As military science fiction , Halo further raises the issue of being human . Stover argued that , since players are to imagine themselves as the Master Chief , the character is correctly presented as a cyborg , neither a flawless machine nor fully human . Players would be unable to empathize with the former , and the latter would be too specifically developed . This immersion has facilitated the use of the Halo series ' multiplayer mode for live digital puppetry , as in Chris Burke 's machinima talk show This Spartan Life .

 In an article in Time , Lev Grossman stated that the Master Chief represents a " new kind of celebrity for a new and profoundly weird millennium " and is a symbol of the increasing legitimacy of video games as an art form . Asher Moses of The Sydney Morning Herald simply described the Chief as " iconic " . Electronic Gaming Monthly and Empire wrote that the Master Chief had become the de facto symbol for the Xbox and for a new generation of gamers to boot . The recognition of the Master Chief has spread to mainstream culture ; Madame Tussauds in Las Vegas has developed a wax sculpture of the Chief . At the ceremony , Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy said that " the Master Chief is as much of a hero today as characters like Spider @-@ Man , Frodo , and Luke Skywalker were for previous generations . " Downes only realized his character was such a huge hit after children lined up around the block for his autograph about a year after the game shipped . 
 Reaction to the Master Chief as a character is mixed . Some reviewers see the character 's silent nature as a strength ; others have said that this quality leaves him insufficiently developed and not believable . UGO ranked the Master Chief at number eight on its 2007 list of top heroes of all time " , ahead of fellow video game characters Samus Aran , Link , and Gordon Freeman . In 2009 , GameDaily listed the " strong and silent type " among top 25 video game archetypes , using Master Chief as an example . Master Chief was also ranked number eight in Empire 's list of the greatest video game characters . In 2009 , GamesRadar included him among the 25 best new characters of the decade . UGO listed Master Chief 's " trademark " helmet in its 2011 list of the coolest helmets and headgear in video games . In 2012 , GamesRadar ranked him as the eight " most memorable , influential , and badass " protagonist in games , commenting : " Chief isn 't the strongest or most crafty hero , and he isn 't particularly charismatic or intelligent or playful .

 = The Allman Brothers Band = 
 The Allman Brothers Band was an American rock band formed in Jacksonville , Florida in 1969 by brothers Duane Allman ( slide guitar and lead guitar ) and Gregg Allman ( vocals , keyboards , songwriting ) , as well as Dickey Betts ( lead guitar , vocals , songwriting ) , Berry Oakley ( bass guitar ) , Butch Trucks ( drums ) , and Jai Johanny " Jaimoe " Johanson ( drums ) . While the band has been called the principal architects of southern rock , they also incorporate elements of blues , jazz , and country music , and their live shows have jam band @-@ style improvisation and instrumentals . 
 The group 's first two studio releases stalled commercially , but their 1971 live release , At Fillmore East , represented an artistic and commercial breakthrough . The album features extended renderings of their songs " In Memory of Elizabeth Reed " and " Whipping Post " , and is often considered among the best live albums ever made . Group leader Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident later that year , and the band dedicated Eat a Peach ( 1972 ) in his memory , a dual studio / live album that cemented the band 's popularity . Following the motorcycle death of bassist Berry Oakley later that year , the group recruited keyboardist Chuck Leavell and bassist Lamar Williams for 1973 's Brothers and Sisters , which , combined with the hit single , " Ramblin ' Man " , placed the group at the forefront of 1970s rock music . Internal turmoil overtook the band soon after ; the group dissolved in 1976 , re @-@ formed briefly at the end of the decade with additional personnel changes , and dissolved again in 1982 . 
 The band re @-@ formed once more in 1989 , releasing a string of new albums and touring heavily . A series of personnel changes in the late 1990s was capped by the departure of Betts . The group found stability during the 2000s with bassist <unk> Burbridge and guitarists Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks ( the nephew of their drummer ) , and became renowned for their month @-@ long string of shows at New York City 's Beacon Theater each spring . The band retired in 2014 with the departure of the aforementioned members . The band has been awarded eleven gold and five platinum albums , and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 . Rolling Stone ranked them 52nd on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time in 2004 .

 Duane Allman , and his younger brother , Gregg , grew up in Daytona Beach , Florida . Gregg was first to pick up the guitar , but his brother soon surpassed him , dropping out of high school to practice constantly . The duo formed their first band , the Escorts , which evolved into the Allman Joys in the mid @-@ 1960s . When an African @-@ American friend introduced Gregg to R & B and soul music , they began to incorporate it into their sound . By 1967 , the group spent time in St. Louis , where a Los Angeles @-@ based recording executive discovered them ; they consequently moved out West and were renamed the Hour Glass , cutting two unsuccessful albums for Liberty Records . Duane moved back to pursue a career as a session musician in Muscle Shoals , Alabama , while Gregg stayed behind in Hollywood bound by contractual obligations with Liberty , who believed he could hold a solo career . The two were apart for the first time for a year , but managed to reconvene in Miami , producing an album @-@ length demo with the 31st of February , a group that included drummer Butch Trucks . 
 At FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals , Duane Allman became the primary session guitarist , recording with artists such as Aretha Franklin and King Curtis . Duane suggested to Wilson Pickett they record a cover of " Hey Jude " by the Beatles ; the single went to number 23 on the national charts . FAME signed Duane to a five @-@ year recording contract , and he put together a group , including Johnny Sandlin and Paul Hornsby . Duane recruited Jai Johanny Johanson ( Jaimoe ) after hearing his drumming on a songwriting demo of Jackie Avery , and the two moved into his home on the Tennessee River . Allman invited bassist Berry Oakley to jam with the new group ; the pair had met in a Jacksonville , Florida club some time earlier , and became quick friends . The group had immediate chemistry , and Duane 's vision for a " different " band — one with two lead guitarists and two drummers — began evolving . Meanwhile , Phil Walden , the manager of the late Otis Redding and several other R & B acts , was looking to expand into rock acts . FAME owner Hall became frustrated with the group ’ s recording methods , and offered the tracks recorded and their contract to Walden and Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records , who purchased them for $ 10 @,@ 000 . Walden intended the upcoming group to be the centerpiece of his new Atlantic @-@ distributed label , Capricorn . 
 Duane and Jaimoe moved to Jacksonville in early March 1969 , as Duane had become frustrated with being a " robot " of those at FAME . He invited anyone who wanted to join to the jam sessions that birthed the Allman Brothers Band . Dickey Betts , leader of Oakley ’ s previous band , the Second Coming , became the group ’ s second lead guitarist , while Butch Trucks , with whom Duane and Gregg had cut a demo less than a year prior , became the new group 's second drummer . The Second Coming 's Reese Wynans played keyboards , and Duane , Oakley , and Betts all shared vocal duties . The unnamed group began to perform free shows in Willow Branch Park in Jacksonville , with an ever @-@ changing , rotating cast of musicians . Duane felt strongly his brother should be the vocalist of the new group ( which effectively eliminated Wynans ' position , as Gregg also played keyboards ) . Gregg left LA and entered rehearsal on March 26 , 1969 , when the group was rehearsing Muddy Waters ' " Trouble No More " Although Gregg was initially intimidated by the musicians , Duane pressured his brother into " singing [ his ] guts out . " Four days later , the group made their debut at the Jacksonville Armory . Although many names were kicked around , including Beelzebub , the six @-@ piece eventually decided on the Allman Brothers Band .

 The group moved to Macon , Georgia by May 1 , where Walden was establishing Capricorn Records . Mike Callahan and Joseph " Red Dog " Campbell became the band ’ s early crew members . " Red Dog " was a disabled Vietnam veteran who donated his monthly disability checks to the band 's cause . In Macon , the group stayed at friend Twiggs Lyndon 's apartment on 309 College Street , which became known as the communal home of the band and crew , nicknamed the Hippie Crash Pad . " There were five or six occupied apartments in the building with the Hippie Crash Pad and you would expect they would call the police on us because we were constantly raising hell at three or four in the morning , but they all just moved out , " said Trucks . Living <unk> , they found a friend in " Mama Louise " Hudson , cook and proprietor of the H & H Soul Food Restaurant , who ran a tab when they were short of funds , early on made good with proceeds from Duane 's recording sessions on the side . The band 's image was radical in the just barely integrated Macon : " A lot of the white folk around here did not approve of them long @-@ haired boys , or of them always having a black guy with them , " said Hudson . The band performed locally , as well as eighty miles north in Atlanta 's Piedmont Park , and practiced at the newly minted Capricorn nearly each day . 
 The group forged a strong brotherhood , spending countless hours rehearsing , consuming psychedelic drugs , and hanging out in Rose Hill Cemetery , where they would write songs . Their first performances outside the South came on May 30 and 31 in Boston , opening for The Velvet Underground . In need of more material , the group remade old blues numbers like " Trouble No More " and " One Way Out " , in addition to improvised jams such as " Mountain Jam " . Gregg , who had struggled to write in the past , became the band 's sole songwriter , composing songs such as " Whipping Post " and " Black @-@ Hearted Woman . " The band was originally set to record their first album in Miami with Cream and John Coltrane producer Tom Dowd , who proved unavailable . Instead , they headed off for New York City in August 1969 to work with Atlantic house engineer Adrian Barber in his first producer credit . The Allman Brothers Band was recorded and mixed in two weeks , and proved a positive experience for the ensemble . New York became regarded within the group as their " second home . " The Allman Brothers Band saw release in November 1969 through Atco and Capricorn Records , but received a poor commercial response , selling less than 35 @,@ 000 copies upon initial release . 
 Executives suggested to Walden that he relocate the band to New York or Los Angeles to " acclimate " them to the industry . " They wanted us to act ' like a rock band ' and we just told them to fuck themselves , " remembered Trucks . For their part , the members of the band remained optimistic , electing to stay in the South . " Everyone told us we 'd fall by the wayside down there , " said Gregg Allman , but the collaboration between the band and Capricorn Records " transformed Macon from this sleepy little town into a very hip , wild and crazy place filled with bikers and rockers " . The band rented a $ 165 @-@ a @-@ month farmhouse on a lake outside of Macon , the busy comings and goings at which reminded them of New York City 's Idlewild Airport . Idlewild South was the home of rehearsals and parties , and was " where the brotherhood came to pass , " according to roadie Kim Payne ; " There was a pact made out there around a campfire — all for one and one for all ... Everybody believed [ in the band ] 100 percent . " Much of the material presented on the band 's second album , Idlewild South , originated at the cabin . Oakley 's wife rented a large Victorian home on 2321 Vineville Avenue in Macon and the band moved into what they dubbed " the Big House " in March 1970 .

 The band played continuously in 1970 , performing over 300 dates on the road traveling in a Ford Econoline van and later , a Winnebago , nicknamed the Wind Bag . Walden doubted the band ’ s future , worrying whether they would ever catch on , but word of mouth spread due to the band 's relentless touring schedule , and crowds got larger . The close proximity of the Winnebago brought about heavy drug use within the group , and all in the group , with the exception of the brothers , were struggling to make a living . In one instance , touring member Twiggs Lyndon stabbed and killed a promoter for not paying the band ; he later claimed temporary insanity . Later that year , Duane accidentally overdosed on opium after a show . Idlewild South , produced by Tom Dowd , was recorded gradually over a period of five months in various cities , including New York , Miami , and Macon , and contained two of the band 's best @-@ known songs , " Midnight Rider " ( later a hit for various artists ) and " In Memory of Elizabeth Reed " , which became one of the band 's famous concert numbers . 
 Idlewild South was issued by Atco and Capricorn Records in September 1970 , less than a year after their debut . The album sold only " marginally better than its predecessor , though the band had a growing national reputation and the album included songs that would become staples of the band 's repertoire — and eventually of rock radio . " Shortly after completing recording , Dowd put Duane in contact with guitarist Eric Clapton , who invited him to contribute to his new project , Derek and the Dominos . Allman was a huge fan of Clapton 's work with Cream , and Clapton had been blown away by Allman 's session work on Wilson Pickett 's " Hey Jude " some years prior . They met after a show one night in Miami and jammed together until the next afternoon , with the two guitarists regarding one another as " instant soulmates . " Clapton invited Duane to join Derek and the Dominos , and by several accounts he considered it ; in the end , he declined the offer and rejoined the Allman Brothers Band , returning after missing a string of several shows . The sessions were collected on Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs , issued that November . 
 Their fortunes began to change over the course of 1971 , where the band 's average earnings doubled . " We realized that the audience was a big part of what we did , which couldn ’ t be duplicated in a studio . A lightbulb finally went off ; we needed to make a live album , " said Gregg Allman . At Fillmore East was recorded over three nights — March 11 , 12 , and 13 , 1971 — at the Fillmore East in New York , for which the band was paid a nightly $ 1 @,@ 250 . At Fillmore East was released in July 1971 by Capricorn Records as a double album , " people @-@ priced " for the cost of a single LP . While previous albums by the band had taken months to hit the charts ( often near the bottom of the top 200 ) , the record started to climb the charts after a matter of days . At Fillmore East peaked at number thirteen on Billboard 's Top Pop Albums chart , and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America that October , becoming their commercial and artistic breakthrough . The album is considered among the best live albums of all time , and in 2004 was one of the albums selected for preservation in the Library of Congress , deemed " culturally , historically , or aesthetically important " by the National Recording Registry . 
 = = = Eat a Peach and Duane Allman and Berry Oakley 's deaths ( 1971 – 72 ) = = = 
 Although suddenly very wealthy and successful , much of the band and its entourage now struggled with heroin addiction . Four individuals — group leader Duane Allman , bassist Berry Oakley , and roadies Robert Payne and Joseph " Red Dog " Campbell — checked into the Linwood @-@ Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971 . On October 29 , 1971 , Duane Allman , then 24 , was killed in a motorcycle accident one day after returning to Macon . Allman was riding his motorcycle at a high speed at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a flatbed truck carrying a lumber crane approached . The truck stopped suddenly in the intersection , forcing Allman to swerve his Harley @-@ Davidson <unk> motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision . As he was doing so , he struck either the back of the truck or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle . The motorcycle bounced into the air , landed on Allman and skidded another 90 feet with Allman pinned underneath , crushing his internal organs . Though he was alive when he arrived at the hospital , despite immediate emergency surgery , he died several hours later from massive internal injuries . 
 After Duane 's death , the band held a meeting on their future ; it was clear all wanted to continue , and after a short period , the band returned to the road . " We all had this thing in us and Duane put it there . He was the teacher and he gave something to us — his disciples — that we had to play out , " said drummer Butch Trucks . The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on their third studio album . Completing the recording of Eat a Peach raised each member 's spirits ; " The music brought life back to us all , and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us . We found strength , vitality , newness , reason , and belonging as we worked on finishing Eat a Peach , " said Allman . " Those last three songs [ ... ] just kinda floated right on out of us [ ... ] The music was still good , it was still rich , and it still had that energy — it was still the Allman Brothers Band . " Released in February 1972 , Eat a Peach was the band 's second hit album , shipping gold and peaking at number four on Billboard 's Top 200 Pop Albums chart . " We 'd been through hell , but somehow we were rolling bigger than ever , " said Gregg Allman . 
 The band performed nearly 90 shows in the following year , touring as a five @-@ piece . The band also purchased 432 acres of land in Juliette , Georgia for $ 160 @,@ 000 and nicknamed it " the Farm " ; it soon became a group hangout and fulfilled bassist Berry Oakley 's communal dreams . Oakley , however , was visibly suffering from the death of his friend : he excessively drank and consumed drugs , and was losing weight quickly . According to friends and family , he appeared to have lost " all hope , his heart , his drive , his ambition , [ and ] his direction " following Duane ’ s death . " Everything Berry had envisioned for everybody — including the crew , the women and children — was shattered on the day Duane died , and he didn ’ t care after that , " said roadie Kim Payne . Oakley repeatedly wished to " get high , be high , and stay high , " causing quiet concern from all those around him . On November 11 , 1972 , slightly inebriated and overjoyed at the prospect of leading a jam session later that night , Oakley crashed his motorcycle into the side of a bus , just three blocks from where Duane had been killed in a bike accident . He declined hospital treatment and went home , but gradually grew delirious . He was taken to the hospital shortly thereafter and died of cerebral swelling caused by a fractured skull . Oakley was buried directly beside Duane at Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon , Georgia . 
 = = = Brothers and Sisters , celebrity , and inner turmoil ( 1973 – 74 ) = = = 
 The band unanimously decided to carry on and arrange auditions for new bassists , with a renewed fervor and determination . Several bassists auditioned , but the band picked Lamar Williams , an old friend of drummer Jai Johanny Johanson 's from Gulfport , Mississippi , two years removed from an Army stint in Vietnam . Chuck Leavell was asked to play piano for Allman ’ s solo album , Laid Back ( 1973 ) , and gradually found himself contributing to the Allman Brothers as well . Dickey Betts became the group 's de facto leader during the recording process . " It 's not like Dickey came in and said , ' I 'm taking over . I 'm the boss . Do this and that . ' It wasn 't overt ; it was still supposedly a democracy but Dickey started doing more and more of the songwriting , " said road manager Willie Perkins . Brothers and Sisters was an enormous success , peaking at number one , resulting in the band becoming " the most popular band in the country . " " Ramblin ' Man " , Betts ' country @-@ infused number , received interest from radio stations immediately , and it rose to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 . 
 The Allman Brothers Band returned to touring , playing larger venues , receiving more profit and dealing with less friendship , miscommunication and spiraling drug problems . This culminated in a backstage brawl when the band played with the Grateful Dead at Washington 's RFK Stadium in June 1973 , which resulted in the firing of three of the band 's longtime roadies . The band played arenas and stadiums almost solely as their drug use escalated . In 1974 , the band was regularly making $ 100 @,@ 000 per show , and was renting the Starship , a customized Boeing 720B used by Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones . " When [ we ] got that goddamn plane , it was the beginning of the end , " said Allman . Both Allman and Betts released top 20 solo albums in 1974 ( The Gregg Allman Tour and Highway Call ) . The sessions that produced 1975 's Win , Lose or Draw , the last album by the original Allman Brothers Band , were disjointed and inconsistent ; Gregg Allman was largely living in Los Angeles and dating pop star Cher , and was , according to biographer Alan Paul , " [ becoming ] more famous for being famous than for his music . " His vocals were recorded there , as he could not be bothered to return to Macon much . Upon its release , it was considered subpar and sold less than its predecessor ; the band later remarked that they were " embarrassed " about the album . 
 From August 1975 to May 1976 , the Allman Brothers Band played 41 shows to some of the biggest crowds of their career . Gradually , the members of the band grew apart during these tours , with sound checks and rehearsals " [ becoming ] a thing of the past . " Allman later pointed to a benefit for presidential candidate Jimmy Carter as the only real " high point " in an otherwise " rough , rough tour . " The shows were considered lackluster and the members were excessive in their drug use . The " breaking point " came when Gregg Allman testified in the trial of security man Scooter Herring . <unk> considered him a " snitch , " and he received death threats , leading to law @-@ enforcement protection . Herring was convicted on five counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and received a 75 @-@ year prison sentence , which was later reduced . For his part , Allman always maintained that Herring had told him to take the deal to turn state 's evidence and that he ( Herring ) would take the fall ; nevertheless , the band refused to communicate with Allman after the incident . As a result , the band finally broke up ; Leavell , Williams , and Jaimoe continued playing together in Sea Level , Betts formed Great Southern , and Allman founded the Gregg Allman Band . The 1976 live album Wipe the Windows , Check the Oil , Dollar Gas was seen as " the last gasp of a dying band , " which was unfortunate for the now @-@ foundering Capricorn Records , which desperately needed the band together to stay afloat . 
 = = = First reunion , subsequent break @-@ up , and interim years ( 1979 – 88 ) = = = 
 In 1978 , Allman and Walden first approached Betts with the idea of a reunion . Their first public appearance together came at a Great Southern show in New York 's Central Park that summer , when Allman , Trucks , and Jaimoe joined the band for a few songs . Williams and <unk> declined to leave Sea Level , so the Allman Brothers Band hired two new members : guitarist Dan Toler and bassist David <unk> . The band reunited with Tom Dowd at Criteria Studios in Miami to cut their reunion album , which was released in February 1979 as Enlightened Rogues , a term Duane had used to describe the band . While the band " tried to make it happen , " they later concluded that the chemistry was not there ; the album was a minor commercial success , which was credited to the production work from Dowd . Betts filed a lawsuit against Walden for nonpayment of record and publishing royalties , and Betts 's lawyer , Steve Massarsky , began managing the group . Betts won the lawsuit , and the rest of the band filed suit while Capricorn declared bankruptcy that October . Massarsky led the successful effort to sign the band with Arista , which pushed the band to " modernize " their sound . " [ Arista founder ] Clive Davis destroyed any hope that we had that we could make the thing work again , " said Trucks later . " He wanted us to be a Southern American version of Led Zeppelin and brought in outside producers and it just kept getting worse . " 
 Their first Arista effort , Reach for the Sky ( 1980 ) , was produced by Nashville songwriters Mike Lawler and Johnny Cobb . Bonnie Bramlett , who toured with the band near the end of the decade , sang lead on one song . Lawler soon became a part of the band 's touring ensemble , incorporating center @-@ stage keytar solos " that most fans consider the band 's nadir . " Drugs remained a problem with the band , particularly among Betts and Allman . Although the album was made with the intention of creating a hit single , the genre of southern rock was waning considerably in the mainstream . The band again grew apart , firing longtime roadie " Red Dog " and replacing Jaimoe with Toler 's brother Frankie , who had been a member of Great Southern . The main point of contention was Jaimoe 's insistence that his wife and manager , Candace Oakley ( Berry 's sister ) , handle his business affairs . " One of the real blights on the history of the Allman Brothers Band was that Jaimoe , this gentle man , was fired from this organization , " said Allman later . Not long after , " the band changed managers , hiring the promoter John Scher after Massarsky eased himself out , reportedly saying , ' It ’ s a million @-@ dollar headache and a quarter @-@ million @-@ dollar job . ' " 
 For their second and final album with Arista , Brothers of the Road , they collaborated with a " name producer " ( John Ryan , of Styx and the Doobie Brothers ) , who pushed the band even harder to change their sound . " Straight from the Heart " was the album 's single , which became a minor hit but heralded the group 's last appearance on the top 40 charts . The band , considering their post @-@ reunion albums " embarrassing , " subsequently broke up in 1982 after clashing with Clive Davis , who rejected every producer the band suggested for a possible third album , including Tom Dowd and Johnny Sandlin . " We broke up in ' 82 because we decided we better just back out or we would ruin what was left of the band ’ s image , " said Betts . The band 's final performance came on Saturday Night Live in January 1982 , where they performed " Southbound " and " Leavin ' . " The members regrouped occasionally in the intervening years ; in 1986 , Betts and Allman toured together , with each opening for one another and collaborating for a set . Allman 's solo career began looking up when he released his first solo album in over a decade in 1987 , I 'm No Angel . The title track became a surprise hit on radio , garnering heavy airplay . 
 = = = Second reunion and heavy touring ( 1989 – 96 ) = = = 
 The Allman Brothers Band celebrated its twentieth anniversary in 1989 , and the band reunited for a summer tour , with Jaimoe once again on drums . In addition , they featured guitarist Warren Haynes and pianist Johnny Neel , both from the Dickey Betts Band , and bassist Allen Woody , who was hired after open auditions held at Trucks 's Florida studio . The classic rock radio format had given the band 's catalog songs new relevance , as did a multi @-@ CD retrospective box set , Dreams . Epic , who had worked with Allman on his solo career , signed the band . Danny Goldberg became the band 's manager ; he had previously worked with acts such as Led Zeppelin and Bonnie Raitt . The group were initially reluctant to tour , but found they performed solidly ; in addition , former roadies such as " Red Dog " returned . The band returned to the studio with longtime producer Tom Dowd for 1990 's Seven Turns , which was considered a return to form . " Good Clean Fun " and " Seven Turns " each became big hits on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart . The addition of Haynes and Woody had " reenergized " the ensemble . Neel left the group in 1990 , and the band added percussionist Marc Quiñones , formerly of Spyro <unk> , the following year . 
 The band performed 87 shows in 1991 , and 77 the following year . The band did not renew Goldberg 's contract as manager , and as a result , their tour manager , Bert Holman , became the band 's full @-@ time manager in 1991 and remained so for the rest of their career . Their next studio effort , Shades of Two Worlds ( 1992 ) , produced the crowd favorite " Nobody Knows " . The band also released a live album , An Evening with the Allman Brothers Band : First Set , recorded at their 1992 residency at New York 's Beacon Theater . The band performed ten consecutive shows there ( establishing themselves as a " New York rite of spring , " according to biographer Alan Paul ) , which set the stage for their return nearly every year afterward . The band grew contentious over a 1993 tour , in which Betts was arrested when he shoved two police officers . Struggling to find a replacement guitarist , they brought in David Grissom ( then touring with John Mellencamp ) , and also Jack Pearson , a Nashville @-@ based friend of Haynes ( the original replacement , Zakk Wylde , filled in for a show but his onstage antics did not fit with the band ) . Haynes was both opening with his own band and headlining with the Allman Brothers , and began to consider leaving the group , due to their increasing lack of communication . 
 Despite the growing tension , Haynes remained a member and Betts returned . Their third post @-@ reunion record , Where It All Begins ( 1994 ) , was recorded entirely live . " The Allman Brothers was a year @-@ by @-@ year thing . There was no indication that it was capable of staying together for years to come . We all looked at it as each tour could be the last one , and there was no reason to think otherwise , " said Haynes . The band continued to tour with greater frequency , attracting younger generations with their headlining of the <unk> Festival . The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1995 ; Allman was severely inebriated and could not make it through his acceptance speech . Seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later , Allman was mortified , providing a catalyst for his final , successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse . During the 1996 run at the Beacon , turmoil came to a breaking point between Allman and Betts , nearly causing a cancellation of a show and causing another band breakup . " We were upstairs in our dressing rooms [ ... ] I ’ m sitting there thinking , ' This is it . This is how it finally ends , ' " said Trucks . Haynes and Woody left to focus on Gov 't Mule , feeling as though a break was imminent with the Allman Brothers Band .

 The group recruited <unk> Burbridge of the Aquarium Rescue Unit to replace Woody on bass , and Jack Pearson on guitar . Concerns arose over the increasing loudness of Allman Brothers shows , which were largely centered on Betts . Pearson , struggling with tinnitus , left as a result following the 1999 Beacon run . Trucks phoned his nephew , Derek Trucks , to join the band for their thirtieth anniversary tour . Trucks was very young , at age 20 , and younger than any of the original members when the band formed . " It was an honor to be part of such a great institution from the start , " said Derek Trucks . " When I first got the gig , I was just trying to maintain the spirit of the whole thing while hopefully bringing some fire to it , hoping to hold up my end while also expressing my own voice . " The Beacon run in 2000 , captured on <unk> ' at the Beacon , was ironically considered among the band 's worst performances ; an eight @-@ show spring tour led to even more strained relations in the group . " It had ceased to be a band — everything had to be based around what Dickey was playing , " said Allman . Anger boiled over within the group towards Betts , which led to all original members sending him a letter , informing him of their intentions to tour without him for the summer . 
 All involved contend that the break was temporary , but Betts responded by hiring a lawyer and suing the group , which led to a permanent divorce . " I had no idea that I would be snapped out of the picture . I thought it was cruel and impersonal , " said Betts . Allman was finally sober and felt more miserable shows with Betts would be a waste of time . Betts later received a cash settlement , which is subject to a confidentiality agreement ; he went on to record new music with a new band . Jimmy Herring joined the band for the summer tour , where the band fought negative press ; fans contended that attending shows by an Allman Brothers Band without Betts was pointless . Herring exited shortly after the tour , as he felt guilty that he would replace Betts . That August , former bassist Allen Woody was found dead in a hotel room in New York . Warren Haynes set up a benefit show for his former bandmate , which featured the Allman Brothers Band . With Derek Trucks unavailable , he sat in for the set . In 2001 , Haynes rejoined the band for their Beacon run : " It was my first time with the band in four years and it was very comfortable , " he remarked . 
 This incarnation of the Allman Brothers Band was well @-@ regarded among fans and the general public , and remained stable and productive . " This band is the greatest one since Duane and Berry , and why shouldn 't it be ? " said Jaimoe . The band released their final studio recording , Hittin ' the Note ( 2003 ) , to critical acclaim . The record was the first to feature Derek Trucks and the only Allman Brothers album to not feature Betts . The band continued to tour throughout the 2000s , remaining a top touring act , regularly attracting more than 20 @,@ 000 fans . The decade closed with a successful run at the Beacon Theater , in celebration of the band 's fortieth anniversary . " That [ 2009 run ] was the most fun I 've ever had in that building , " said Allman , and it was universally regarded within the band as a career highlight . The run featured numerous special guests , including Eric Clapton , whom all in the band regarded as the most " special " guest , due to his association with Duane . Allman had a liver transplant in 2010 , and suffered health setbacks for the following two years . He went to rehab in 2012 for addiction following his medical treatments . In 2012 the Allman Brothers started their own music festival , The Peach , which features many associated acts and many genres in addition to two Allman Brothers performances . They played a run at the Beacon in 2013 per tradition and after continued to tour . In 2014 , Haynes and Derek Trucks announced their intention to depart the group at the end of the year . The group intended their 2014 run of Beacon shows to be their last , but the residency was cut short when Allman developed bronchitis . 
 The Allman Brothers Band performed its final show on October 28 , 2014 at the Beacon Theater . The show was the 238th straight sellout for the band at the Beacon . The concert consisted of three sets , comprising mostly music from their first five records , with no guest musicians sitting in ( " We had a band meeting and decided no guest sit @-@ ins . We 're going out with just the band , " Allman told reporters ) . Following the sets , which ran into the early morning hours , the band joined together center stage and took a bow , with Allman recalling the group 's first rehearsal 45 years prior . " I was called to come and meet these guys in Jacksonville , Florida , [ ... ] on March 26 , 1969 . Now , we 're gonna do the first song we ever played . " Following this , the band performed " Trouble No More " by Muddy Waters . During the night 's intermissions , a video screen displayed a message : " The road indeed goes on forever . So stay calm , eat a peach and carry on ... " 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 The Allman Brothers Band have generally been considered one of the pioneering bands in southern rock , although the group distanced themselves from the term . Guitarist Dickey Betts was most vocal about this classification , which he considered unfair : " I think it ’ s limiting . I ’ d rather just be known as a progressive rock band from the South . I ’ m damned proud of who I am and where I ’ m from , but I hate the term ‘ Southern rock . ’ I think calling us that pigeonholed us and forced people to expect certain types of music from us that I don ’ t think are fair . " Gregg Allman also saw the " southern rock " tag as redundant , saying it was like saying " rock rock " . The band was certainly at the forefront of the genre 's popularity in the early 1970s ; the breakthrough of At Fillmore East led their hometown of Macon to become flooded with " southern rock " groups . Despite this , the group has continued to remove themselves from the term . " The problem I have is a lot of people associate it with rednecks and rebel flags and backward mentality . That has never been representative of the Allman Brothers Band , " said guitarist Warren Haynes . 
 The group largely infused hints of the blues , jazz , and country into their music . They all avidly shared their record collections with one another during the early days of the band . For example , Betts was into country music and the guitar work of Chuck Berry , while Trucks was largely into groups such as the Rolling Stones and the Grateful Dead . Duane and Gregg Allman grew infatuated with rhythm and blues in their teens , collecting records by James Brown , B.B. King , Sonny Boy Williamson , and Howlin ' Wolf . Drummer Jai Johanny " Jaimoe " Johanson largely introduced the group to jazz . While Betts commented that he was interested in artists such as Howard Roberts prior , Jaimoe " really fired us up on it , " introducing his bandmates to Miles Davis and John Coltrane . Duane Allman was also inspired by Howard Roberts , Wes Montgomery , Tal Farlow , and Kenny Burrell . The source of the band 's modal jamming in their earliest days was Coltrane ’ s rendition of " My Favorite Things " and Davis 's " All Blues , " which Jaimoe occasionally stole from : " I did a lot of copying , but only from the best . " This type of jazz @-@ infused jamming is expressed in the instrumental " In Memory of Elizabeth Reed " , which focuses heavily on improvisation . " Whipping Post " was notable for its inclusion of blues @-@ ballad themes , and became one of the most popular ( and longest ) compositions . Later , Betts generally led the band in a more " country " direction following Duane 's passing ; their only hit single " Ramblin ' Man " was considered so unusually " country " for the group they were initially reluctant to record it . 
 Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists , which was inspired by Curtis Mayfield ; " [ he ] wanted the bass , keyboards , and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping , " said Allman . Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians . " The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques , often forming intricate , interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist , Berry Oakley , setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies . " Dickey Betts ' playing was very melody @-@ based ; " My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight , because I ’ m such a melody guy that even when I ’ m playing the blues , I go for melody first , " he said . His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably : " I played mandolin , ukulele , and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar , which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from . " He later characterized their style as " question and answer , anticipation and conclusion , " which involved allowing each musician 's downbeat to arrive in a different spot , while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines . 
 The group also held an improvisational approach to live performances , which connected the band with jam band culture . " Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades , but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music , " said Haynes . " We sure didn ’ t set out to be a " jam band " but those long jams just emanated from within the band , because we didn ’ t want to just play three minutes and be over , " said Allman . Rolling Stone referred to the group as " without question the first great jam band , and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States . Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable southern rock acts — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd , the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success , and also " almost single @-@ handedly " made Capricorn Records into " a major independent label . " Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top , writing for Rolling Stone , wrote that the group " defined the best of every music from the American South in that time . They were the best of all of us . " He went on to call the band " a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race and ego . It was a thing of beauty . " The band 's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans , one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of " latter @-@ day collegiate jam rock . " AllMusic praised the band 's history : " they went from being America 's single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories , to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era . "
