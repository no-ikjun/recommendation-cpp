 at Tampa Stadium , Tampa , Florida 
 Super Bowl XXV took place amidst a background of war and patriotism in front of 73 @,@ 813 fans at Tampa Stadium , in Tampa , Florida . The Gulf War had begun less than two weeks previous and the nation rallied around the Super Bowl as a symbol of America . Adding to the patriotism was Whitney Houston 's stirring rendition of the National Anthem , which became known as one of the greatest renditions in Super Bowl history . The game lived up to the stirring Anthem , as it went down as the most competitive Super Bowl in history . The Giants got off to a quick 3 – 0 lead . However , the Bills scored the next 12 points , on a field goal , a touchdown by backup running back Don Smith , and a safety after Jeff Hostetler was sacked in the end zone by Bruce Smith , to give the Bills a 12 – 3 lead . The Giants then ran a drive that took nearly 8 minutes , and culminated in a 14 @-@ yard touchdown pass from Hostetler to Stephen Baker making the score 12 – 10 at halftime . 
 The Giants received the second half kickoff and mounted a record @-@ setting drive , during which they converted on five third down plays . The opening drive ran for over 9 minutes ( a Super Bowl record ) and culminated in a 1 @-@ yard touchdown run by Ottis Anderson , giving the Giants a 17 – 12 lead . The signature play of the drive came on a third down play , when Giants receiver Mark Ingram appeared about to be tackled well short of a first down . However , Ingram evaded several tacklers , and dragged one defender just enough to get the Giants the first down , and kept the drive alive . By this time , the Giants strategy to handle the Bills offense had become clear : keep them off the field . Indeed , the Giants two touchdown drives consumed over 17 minutes . 
 The Bills struck back quickly . On the first play of the fourth quarter , Thurman Thomas ran for a 31 @-@ yard touchdown that put the Bills back in front , 19 – 17 . A few possessions later , the Giants drove down to the Bills 4 yard line , but were unable to score a touchdown and had to settle for a 21 @-@ yard field goal by Matt Bahr that gave the Giants a 20 – 19 lead . Both teams exchanged possessions before the Bills began one final drive . The Bills drove down to the Giants 30 @-@ yard line to set up what would be a potentially game @-@ winning 47 @-@ yard field goal attempt by Scott Norwood . Just before the kick , ABC showed a graphic indicating that , on grass that season , Norwood had only made 3 – of – 7 field goals from at least 40 yards , and that the 47 @-@ yarder would be Norwood 's longest ever on grass . A few moments later , in what became the game 's signature moment , Norwood 's attempt missed wide right , and the Giants won their second Super Bowl in five years , 20 – 19 . 
 The Giants set a Super Bowl record for time of possession with a mark of 40 : 33 , and Ottis Anderson was named MVP of the game after rushing for 102 yards and a touchdown .

 = 102d Intelligence Wing = 
 The United States Air Force 's 102d Intelligence Wing ( 102 IW ) , of the Massachusetts Air National Guard , is a military intelligence unit located at Otis Air National Guard Base , Massachusetts . Its primary subordinate operational unit is the 101st Intelligence Squadron . According to the Air Force , the history of the 102d begins with the 318th Fighter Group , which was active during World War II . After the war , the 318th was inactivated , and eventually the 102d Fighter Wing was formed , which had a direct lineage link . In 1946 , the 102d was activated at Logan International Airport where it stayed until 1968 , when it moved to Otis Air Force Base . Beginning in 1946 , the wing began regular patrols of the Northeastern United States which took place in conjunction with Air Force active duty units . In 1968 , the 102d was moved to Otis , where it continued its regular patrols until 1973 . 
 During the time that the wing had a flying mission , the wing deployed to many locations around the globe to assist in missions for the Air Force . In 1961 , the wing deployed to France during the Berlin Crisis . Twenty eight years later , the wing deployed to Panama during Operation Coronet Nighthawk . It also participated in Operation Northern Watch , helping to patrol the No @-@ Fly Zone north of the 36th parallel in Iraq . During the 11 September attacks , the 102d Fighter Wing deployed the first Air Force aircraft toward New York City , but they arrived too late to stop the attacks . 
 Over the years , the wing has controlled many other Air National Guard units . Following the inactivation of the 67th Fighter Wing in November 1950 , the wing was put in charge of a few fighter units on the Atlantic Coast . In 1976 , the wing even became responsible for the 147th Fighter Interceptor Group , located in Texas . 
 Military downsizing through the Base Realignment and Closure ( BRAC ) process removed the wing 's F @-@ 15C Eagles beginning in 2007 , leaving the 102d with an intelligence gathering mission . If activated to federal service , the Wing is gained by the United States Air Force Air Force Intelligence , Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency , and is one of three Air National Guard wings under this agency . As commonwealth militia units , the units in the 102d Intelligence Wing are not in the normal United States Air Force chain of command . They are under the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts National Guard unless they are federalized by order of the President of the United States . 
 = = Mission = = 
 According to their home page , the 102d 's mission is " to provide world wide precision intelligence and command and control , along with trained and experienced airmen for expeditionary combat support and homeland security . " In addition , the website says that their Air Force based mission is in line with the ability of joint force commanders to keep pace with information and incorporate it into a campaign plan . In addition to its strictly military role , the wing shares the overall Air National Guard mission of providing assistance during national emergencies such as natural disasters and civil disturbances . 
 = = History = = 
 The 102d Intelligence Wing traces its roots to the 318th Fighter Group which was formed in 1942 . It fought in the Pacific as part of bomber escort missions to Japan , and participated in aircraft carrier operations , rarely experienced by the Army Air Force . The 318th returned to the United States after the war , was inactivated on 12 January 1946 
 The wartime 318th Fighter Group was re @-@ designated as the 102d Fighter Group , and was allotted to the Massachusetts Air National Guard on 24 May 1946 . It was organized at Logan Airport , Boston , and was extended federal recognition on 22 October 1946 by the National Guard Bureau . The 102d Fighter Group was bestowed the lineage , history , honors , and colors of the 318th Fighter Group . 
 From October 1946 the 102nd ( previously the 69th Fighter Wing ) was commanded by General Louis E. Boutwell until his death in July 1947 . From July 1947 until 1956 the 102nd was commanded by Brigadier General Lyle E. Halstead . 
 = = = Cold War = = = 
 In the post @-@ war era the National Guard Bureau began a major expansion of its air units . Massachusetts was allotted the 67th Fighter Wing , which consisted of the 101st Fighter Squadron , the 131st Fighter Squadron , the 132nd Fighter Squadron , the 202nd Air Service Group , 601st Signal Construction Company , 101st Communications Squadron , 101st Air Control Squadron , 151st Air Control and Warning Group , <unk> Air Force Band , 101st Weather Flight and the <unk> Aviation Engineer Company . The 67th Wing was assigned to Air Defense Command . 
 Guard units were generally neglected when the United States Air Force was created . Despite the introduction of jet fighters , the Guard units were left with generally overused World War II propeller aircraft , and had few funds for training . As the Cold War intensified , the Air Force looked to the Guard to fill United States @-@ based interception missions and started overhauling their organization . Although the Massachusetts Air National Guard wasn 't federalized for the Korean War , many airmen volunteered for active duty and flew in Korea . On 1 November 1950 , the 67th Fighter Wing was inactivated and replaced by the 102d Fighter Wing , including just the 101st and 131st squadrons and their associated support units , and at some point before 1961 the wing was renamed a Tactical Fighter Wing . Additionally , the wing kept the <unk> , and the <unk> . The squadrons were issued F @-@ <unk> <unk> , but these were recalled and replaced by F @-@ 51 Mustangs which were flown until 1954 when the F @-@ 94 Starfire replaced the Mustangs . In 1952 the 253rd Combat Communications Group was activated and added to the 102d . In 1958 the Wing converted to the F @-@ <unk> Sabre . 
 From 1956 to 1976 , the 102d was commanded by Brigadier General Charles W. Sweeney , pilot of the B @-@ 29 Superfortress Bockscar that dropped the Fat Man nuclear bomb on Nagasaki , Japan . During his tenure , the wing developed from a rather new unit to the mainstay of air defense in the Northeastern United States . 
 = = = = Berlin Wall Crisis = = = = 
 On 16 August 1961 , when the Berlin Wall crisis was unfolding , several United States Air Force Reserve units were notified of their pending recall to active duty . On 1 October the wing and its three squadrons , the 101st , 131st and 138th were placed on active duty at Otis Air Force Base . 
 In late October , the 102d departed Logan for Phalsbourg @-@ <unk> Air Base , Phalsbourg , France . The wing had 82 Sabres , plus two C @-@ 47 Skytrains and six T @-@ 33 Shooting Stars for support and training purposes . During the crisis , the wing controlled the 102d Tactical Fighter Group , the 104th Tactical Fighter Group , and the 174th Tactical Fighter Group from New York . The 102d 's primary mission was to provide close air support to NATO ground forces , including the Seventh Army , and air interdiction . During the blockade , the 102d did not incur any losses . Starting on 5 December 1961 the 102d began deploying to <unk> Air Base , Libya for gunnery training . 
 During its time in Europe , the 102d participated in several United States Air Force and North Atlantic Treaty Organization exercises , including a deployment to Leck Air Base , West Germany near the Danish border . At Leck , ground and support crews from both countries exchanged duties , learning how to perform aircraft maintenance and operational support tasks . 
 The 102d returned to the United States in August 1962 . Regular Air Force personnel and a group of Air National Guard personnel who volunteered to remain on active duty formed the 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the newly activated 366th Tactical Fighter Wing . 
 = = = = Relocation to Otis = = = = 
 In 1968 , the 102d Tactical Fighter Wing moved to Otis Air Force Base , and was reassigned from the Air Defense Command to the Tactical Air Command the next year . The wing flew the F @-@ 84F Thunderstreak from 1964 until June 1971 , when a squadron of F @-@ 100D Super Sabres was transferred directly from units fighting the Vietnam War . These were superseded soon after by the Mach 2 F @-@ 106 Delta Darts and on 10 June 1972 , the unit became the 102d Air Defense Wing . On 30 December 1973 , Otis Air Force Base was inactivated and transferred to the Massachusetts Air National Guard as Otis Air National Guard Base . 
 The wing intercepted Soviet Tupolev Tu @-@ 95 Bear bombers on many occasions , the first of which occurred off Long Island on 25 April 1975 . Many of these incidents involved escorting the Bears to Cuba . The wing occasionally shadowed drug smuggling aircraft , and on one occasion was scrambled to escort an unidentified object , which later turned out to be a weather balloon . 
 In 1976 , the 102d Fighter Interceptor Group was inactivated and reformed as the 102d Fighter Interceptor Wing . It assumed authority for the 177th Fighter Interceptor Group at Atlantic City Air National Guard Base and the 125th Fighter Interceptor Group at Jacksonville Air National Guard Base . Both units flew the F @-@ 106 . It also assumed command of the 107th Fighter Interceptor Group at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station and the 147th Fighter Interceptor Group at Ellington Field , Texas . The latter two flew the F @-@ 4C Phantom . 
 The 102d Fighter Interceptor Wing lost its F @-@ <unk> on 5 January 1988 . Between January and April 1988 , the wing converted to the F @-@ 15A Eagle , which it received from the 5th Fighter @-@ Interceptor Squadron which was inactivating at Minot Air Force Base . It then resumed its alert commitment at Otis , and also established a new Detachment 1 at Loring Air Force Base , taking over for the inactivating 5th Fighter @-@ Interceptor Squadron . The 102d was the first Air National Guard unit to be equipped with the F @-@ 15 . 
 On 24 January 1989 , airmen monitoring the radar at the Northeast Air Defense Sector at Griffiss Air Force Base spotted a plane which was not following any known flight plan . The order was then given to " scramble the Eagles , " after repeated attempts to contact the pilot failed . Two jets then took off from Loring to search for the " unknown rider . " The pilots later came across a plane that was blacked out , with no lights on inside or outside . The pilot was a narcotics smuggler from Colombia 's Medellin drug cartel . He was carrying had a street value of two hundred million dollars in the amount of 500 kilograms of cocaine .

 The wing continued its air defense mission after the fall of the Soviet Union . In 1992 , the wing deployed eight pilots , five F @-@ 15 Eagles , and 48 maintenance and security personnel , for five days training at Canadian Forces Base Goose Bay , Labrador , Canada . The same year , with the reorganization of the Air Force , the wing was reassigned from the disbanding Tactical Air Command to the newly formed Air Combat Command . In July 1993 , the wing deployed 50 personnel from the 102d Civil Engineering Squadron under field conditions , to the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas . They helped rebuild schools and municipal facilities damaged by Hurricane Andrew . 
 On 11 February 1993 , jets were scrambled to intercept the hijacked Lufthansa Flight 592 , which eventually landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport without incident . The planes were joined by F @-@ 16s from the 177th Fighter Wing in Atlantic City , New Jersey . The F @-@ 15s initially intercepted the aircraft off the coast of eastern Canada . The planes then began to trail the jet at a distance of 10 @-@ mile ( 16 km ) . As they approached the airport , the distance decreased to 5 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) . The fighters then did a low fly @-@ by as the plane landed . They continued to circle around the airport until they returned to Otis . 
 In 1994 , the 102d received more F @-@ 15A / B Eagles from the 32nd Fighter Group at <unk> Air Base , which was inactivating as part of the post Cold War draw down of forces in Europe . 
 = = = = Deployments = = = = 
 Between 1991 and 1995 , the 102d deployed to Panama as part of Operation Coronet Nighthawk , which was a drug interdiction operation . In 1992 the wing became simply the 102d Fighter Wing as part of an Air Force @-@ wide renaming of units . The wing was deployed from 1995 to 1998 to Iceland for periodic 45 day deployments . In 1998 , the wing 's members also trained and deployed to Iceland , Canada , Korea , and Europe . The next year , the 102d participated in Operation Northern Watch and was deployed to Turkey in order to enforce the no @-@ fly zone over Iraq north of the 36th Parallel . In 2000 , personnel were deployed to the Middle East and Europe in order to participate in Operation Southern Watch .

 Around 8 : 30 on the morning of 11 September 2001 , the Otis Air Base Operations Center received a call from the Federal Aviation Administration 's Cape Cod Facility Calls Operations Center that it might be receiving a call from the North American Aerospace Defense Command 's Northeast Air Defense Sector . The manager of the Cape Cod facility then called the 102d at Otis Air National Guard Base as they figured " ... a call [ to Otis Air Base ] will be coming from NEADS soon and a scramble order is likely . " He called the base because he figured that the pilots would appreciate the heads up . When he called the Otis operations center , the superintendent of aviation management , Mark Rose , answered . He was initially confused by the call as no identification was given . Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Duffy was then handed the phone and alerted of the situation . On his radio , he called pilot Major Daniel Nash , the pilot who was sharing alert duty , and told him to get ready for a coming alert call . He also told him to suit up and get ready for a scramble call . 
 Soon after , the commander of the 101st Fighter Squadron phoned the Northeast Air Defense Sector and asked for permission to launch the fighter jets . The sector in turn responded by ordering the commander of the weapons team which controlled the jets , Major Kevin <unk> , to place the fighters on " battle stations . " This resulted in a warning siren sounding at Otis and the pilots scrambled to their jets . Four to five minutes later , the scramble order was received and the jets took off . Officially , this occurred at 8 : 46 am , with a six @-@ minute difference between the official and unofficial accounts . Duffy radioed his command post for guidance and was told among other things that American Airlines Flight 11 was a Boeing 737 , when in reality it was a 767 . Once in the air , their radar kicked in , allowing them to effectively intercept the plane . 
 Difficulties in accurately locating Flight 11 caused a delay of five minutes , to 8 : 43 am , before the scramble order was given and pilots Duffy and Nash could respond . When Flight 11 hit the North Tower at 8 : 46 , the two jets were still readying for flight and did not take off until 8 : 52 am . 
 Major <unk> was then asked what to do with the fighters and he responded by saying , " Send ' em to New York City still . Continue ! Go ! This is what I got . Possible news that a 737 just hit the World Trade Center . This is a real @-@ world ... Continue taking the fighters down to the New York City area , JFK [ International Airport ] area , if you can . Make sure that the FAA clears it — your route all the way through ... Let 's press with this . " Unsure of their target , they were directed to a holding pattern in military @-@ controlled airspace Whiskey 105 off of Long Island to avoid New York area air traffic . At 9 : 03 am , United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower as the fighters were progressing to their holding position . The Northeast Air Defense Sector was not advised of this hijacked aircraft until 9 : 03 . 
 Between 9 : 09 and 9 : 13 , the jets stayed in a holding pattern . Soon after , they headed toward Manhattan and arrived at 9 : 25 , where they established a Combat Air Patrol over the city . 
 While all of this was going on , senior battle staff at Otis were watching the news when United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower . This immediately caused one commander to shout out , " We need to go to battle staff ! " This order caused senior commanders to disperse and head towards nearby operations buildings . Inside , the gathered together in the battle cab of the installation operations center . Soon after , a voice came over the base 's loudspeakers : " The commander has ordered the 102d core battle staff to assemble . Please report to the operations building immediately . " Mobilization of the wing began to occur after this time . At the time of the order , eighteen planes were ready for flight and commanders began to prepare based on what they anticipated they would be asked to do . Most of these actions were guessing because there had never been an attack on the country before . Knowing that they couldn 't await on guidance from the North American Aerospace Defense Command , the recalled all training flights and began loading fuel and weapons onto all available fighter jets . 
 Meanwhile , at the battle cab , a maintenance squadron officer was told , " Listen , I want you to generate as many airframes [ i.e. fighter jets ] as you can ! " This immediately caused all personnel to be called back and they were ordered to work on the remaining jets . This rush involved the placement of missiles on all jets , including some newer missiles which were rarely pulled out . Six jets which were on a training mission were traversing through the Whiskey Airspace when they were told by the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center to head back to Otis immediately . Once landed , the pilots were told to park their jets but leave the engines on . Finally , the first planes took off at 10 : 20 in the morning . 
 After a while , an order was received to launch all available fighters . Pilots were briefed on the national emergency and the potential that they might have to take out an aircraft . At this point , someone then ran into the room and said that there had been an order that was received from the Northeast Air Defense Sector that all available jets must launch . The pilots then ran out to their aircraft with speaker Treacy saying " Go , go , go ! " In the haste that the morning had become , not all the jets had been refueled and a majority of the jets were still unarmed . The handful of jets that were armed were sent up with one or two missiles . The standard missile load involves at least two missiles at launch . This is after the handlers had worked at a " furious pace " and " hurried to fix all available jets with live weapons . " Arming of the jets even began fifteen minutes after the South Tower had been <unk> this fact would later lend credence to the theory that there was an idea floating around to ram the hijacked planes with a jet . Starting around 10 : 30 and ending at six that night , all twenty one planes were put into the air .

 After the initial shock of the attacks had passed , questions arose about how the military handled the hijacking and subsequent response with the jets . Some thought that the jets had been purposely kept from flying immediately to New York City . The questions arising from the response time of the jets come from the practice of Cold War era policies which prohibited the immediate response to an emergency like a hijacking . First responder and pilot Daniel Nash said that he could not recall being told that the North Tower was hit but he did remember seeing the smoke over 70 @-@ mile ( 110 km ) away . It is also claimed by conspiracists that the calculations of North American Aerospace Defense Command were incorrect because according to their own calculations , the planes were flying at 24 % of their maximum speed . This statement takes into account the time in which the planes were in a holding pattern over military airspace . The jets were also prohibited from going supersonic over land by Federal Aviation Administration rules . These rules are meant to prevent damage to buildings from the shock wave a sonic boom produces .

 More than 600 wing members were mobilized for Operation Noble Eagle , and the wing began flying around @-@ the @-@ clock combat air patrol missions immediately thereafter . This continued until February 2002 . On 22 December 2001 the wing escorted American Airlines Flight 63 as a direct result of Richard Reid trying to blow up a plane . 
 In the buildup to the invasion of Afghanistan , six F @-@ 15s and 161 personnel were sent to the Persian Gulf region . The wing also patrolled the skies of the Northeastern United States during this time period . The wing though never deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom . The wing converted from the F @-@ 15A / B to the F @-@ 15C / D in 2004 . These planes came from Kadena Air Base . 
 = = = = BRAC 2005 = = = = 
 The Base Realignment and Closure 2005 commission originally planned to close Otis Air National Guard Base and dissolve the 102d . Locals argued that this would leave a huge gap in the national air defenses . Commission officials , after visiting the base , decided to keep it open , but the 102d would still lose its planes , only this time they were only going to the 104th Fighter Wing , based at Barnes Municipal Airport . 
 In May 2006 it trained with the Israeli Air Force 's 115 Squadron . 
 The wing hosted the Cape Cod Air Show & Open House , its last air show with the F @-@ 15C Eagle at the end of Air Force Week in August 2007 . The wing shared a commonality with the 101st Air Refueling Wing , the 103d Fighter Wing , and the 104th Fighter Wing , which due to commission decisions , also changed the type of planes that they flew . Beginning in 2007 , the F @-@ 15s began moving to Barnes Municipal Airport . With the grounding of the F @-@ 15 Eagles , the 158th Fighter Wing , which is based in Vermont took over the role of patrolling the Northeast 's skies earlier than expected . This interruption of the F @-@ 15 's flight , coinciding with the transitioning of the fighter jets to the 104th Fighter Wing , created some issues . 
 On 24 January 2008 , the 102d Fighter Wing flew its last patrol mission . The unit 's wing commander , Colonel Anthony <unk> , led the flight , accompanied by Major Daniel Nash , who was one of the first responders for 9 / 11 . Fire trucks were on hand when the team landed a half @-@ hour later , giving the planes and the pilots the customary ceremonial hose @-@ down for the last time .

 When it was announced that the wing would be restructured and Otis Air National Guard Base would remain open , discussions began about the future of the 102d . Staff of the 102d and those at Massachusetts Air National Guard headquarters considered a plan centered on the idea that the wing could transition to an intelligence mission to support the growing War on Terror . The idea hit a roadblock when it was announced that the funds which the wing could use to convert into its new mission had been depleted . 
 Eventually , Governor Deval Patrick announced that the wing would adopt an intelligence role as soon as the aircraft left . 
 Original Base Realignment and Closure commission plans only hinted at a Distributed Common Ground System being created at Otis . These plans did not include the air guardsmen affected by the loss of their jobs . The issue was resolved when the Air Force announced its plans , right before the F @-@ 15s started to leave for Barnes . 
 The 102d Fighter Wing was formally re @-@ designated the 102d Intelligence Wing on 6 April 2008 and was planned to reach full operational capacity in 2010 . 
 Members of the wing had the option of moving with the F @-@ 15s to Barnes , but most decided to stay behind and train for new missions . The crash trucks went to Barnes , leaving the brush breakers of the Massachusetts Military Reservation behind . The buildings formerly occupied by the fighter wing , including the hangars , will be occupied by the intelligence mission . 
 On 6 November 2009 , ground was broken on new facilities for the 102d Intelligence Wing . The building will eventually replace the temporary facilities that the wing is now operating in .

 = Emperor penguin = 
 The emperor penguin ( Aptenodytes forsteri ) is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species and is endemic to Antarctica . The male and female are similar in plumage and size , reaching 122 cm ( 48 in ) in height and weighing from 22 to 45 kg ( 49 to 99 lb ) . The dorsal side and head are black and sharply delineated from the white belly , pale @-@ yellow breast and bright @-@ yellow ear patches . Like all penguins it is flightless , with a streamlined body , and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat . 
 Its diet consists primarily of fish , but can also include crustaceans , such as krill , and cephalopods , such as squid . In hunting , the species can remain submerged up to 18 minutes , diving to a depth of 535 m ( 1 @,@ 755 ft ) . It has several adaptations to facilitate this , including an unusually structured haemoglobin to allow it to function at low oxygen levels , solid bones to reduce barotrauma , and the ability to reduce its metabolism and shut down non @-@ essential organ functions . 
 The only penguin species that breeds during the Antarctic winter , emperor penguins trek 50 – 120 km ( 31 – 75 mi ) over the ice to breeding colonies which may include thousands of individuals . The female lays a single egg , which is incubated by the male while the female returns to the sea to feed ; parents subsequently take turns foraging at sea and caring for their chick in the colony . The lifespan is typically 20 years in the wild , although observations suggest that some individuals may live to 50 years of age . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Emperor penguins were described in 1844 by English zoologist George Robert Gray , who created the generic name from Ancient Greek word elements , <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> [ a @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> ] , " without @-@ wings @-@ diver " . Its specific name is in honour of the German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster , who accompanied Captain James Cook on his second voyage and officially named five other penguin species . Forster may have been the first person to sight the penguins in 1773 – 74 ; he recorded a sighting of what he believed to be A. patagonicus but , given the location , may well have been A. forsteri . 
 Together with the similarly coloured but smaller king penguin ( A. patagonicus ) , the emperor penguin is one of two extant species in the genus Aptenodytes . Fossil evidence of a third species — <unk> 's penguin ( A. <unk> ) — has been found in fossil records from the late Pliocene , about three million years ago , in New Zealand . Studies of penguin behaviour and genetics have proposed that the genus Aptenodytes is basal ; in other words , that it split off from a branch which led to all other living penguin species . Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests this split occurred around 40 million years ago . 
 = = Description = = 
 Adult emperor penguins stand up to 110 – 130 cm ( 43 – 51 in ) tall . The weight ranges from 22 @.@ 7 to 45 @.@ 4 kg ( 50 to 100 lb ) and varies by sex , with males weighing more than females . It is the fifth heaviest living bird species , after only the larger varieties of ratite . The weight also varies by season , as both male and female penguins lose substantial mass while raising hatchlings and incubating their egg . A male emperor penguin must withstand the Antarctic cold for more than two months to protect his egg from extreme cold . During this entire time he doesn 't eat anything . Most male penguins will lose about 12 kg ( 26 lb ) while they wait for their chicks to hatch . The mean weight of males at the start of the breeding season is 38 kg ( 84 lb ) and that of females is 29 @.@ 5 kg ( 65 lb ) . After the breeding season this drops to 23 kg ( 51 lb ) for both sexes . 
 Like all penguin species , emperor penguins have streamlined bodies to minimize drag while swimming , and wings that are more like stiff , flat flippers . The tongue is equipped with rear @-@ facing barbs to prevent prey from escaping when caught . Males and females are similar in size and colouration . The adult has deep black dorsal feathers , covering the head , chin , throat , back , dorsal part of the flippers , and tail . The black plumage is sharply delineated from the light @-@ coloured plumage elsewhere . The underparts of the wings and belly are white , becoming pale yellow in the upper breast , while the ear patches are bright yellow . The upper mandible of the 8 cm ( 3 in ) long bill is black , and the lower mandible can be pink , orange or lilac . In juveniles , the auricular patches , chin and throat are white , while its bill is black . Emperor penguin chicks are typically covered with silver @-@ grey down and have black heads and white masks . A chick with all @-@ white plumage was found in 2001 , but was not considered to be an albino as it did not have pink eyes . Chicks weigh around 315 g ( 11 oz ) after hatching , and fledge when they reach about 50 % of adult weight . 
 The emperor penguin 's dark plumage fades to brown from November until February ( the Antarctic summer ) , before the yearly moult in January and February . Moulting is rapid in this species compared with other birds , taking only around 34 days . Emperor penguin feathers emerge from the skin after they have grown to a third of their total length , and before old feathers are lost , to help reduce heat loss . New feathers then push out the old ones before finishing their growth . 
 The average yearly survival rate of emperor penguins has been measured at 95 @.@ 1 % , with an average life expectancy of 19 @.@ 9 years . The same researchers estimated that 1 % of emperor penguins hatched could feasibly reach an age of 50 years . In contrast , only 19 % of chicks survive their first year of life . Therefore , 80 % of the emperor penguin population comprises adults five years and older . 
 = = = Vocalization = = = 
 As the species has no fixed nest sites that individuals can use to locate their own partner or chick , emperor penguins must rely on vocal calls alone for identification . They use a complex set of calls that are critical to individual recognition between parents , offspring , and mates , displaying the widest variation in individual calls of all penguins . <unk> emperor penguins use two frequency bands simultaneously . Chicks use a frequency @-@ modulated whistle to beg for food and to contact parents . 
 = = = Adaptations to cold = = = 
 The emperor penguin breeds in the coldest environment of any bird species ; air temperatures may reach − 40 ° C ( − 40 ° F ) , and wind speeds may reach 144 km / h ( 89 mph ) . Water temperature is a frigid − 1 @.@ 8 ° C ( 28 @.@ 8 ° F ) , which is much lower than the emperor penguin 's average body temperature of 39 ° C ( 102 ° F ) . The species has adapted in several ways to counteract heat loss . Feathers provide 80 – 90 % of its insulation , and it has a layer of sub @-@ dermal fat which may be up to 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick before breeding . This resultant blubber layer impedes the mobility of emperor penguins on land compared to their less fat @-@ insulated cousins , the Magellanic penguins . While the density of contour feathers is approximately 9 per square centimetre , a combination of dense <unk> and down feathers ( <unk> ) likely play a critical role for insulation . Muscles allow the feathers to be held erect on land , reducing heat loss by trapping a layer of air next to the skin . Conversely , the plumage is flattened in water , thus waterproofing the skin and the downy <unk> . <unk> is vital in facilitating insulation and in keeping the plumage oily and water @-@ repellent . 
 The emperor penguin is able to thermoregulate ( maintain its core body temperature ) without altering its metabolism , over a wide range of temperatures . Known as the thermoneutral range , this extends from − 10 to 20 ° C ( 14 to 68 ° F ) . Below this temperature range , its metabolic rate increases significantly , although an individual can maintain its core temperature from 38 @.@ 0 ° C ( 100 @.@ 4 ° F ) down to − 47 ° C ( − 53 ° F ) . Movement by swimming , walking , and shivering are three mechanisms for increasing metabolism ; a fourth process involves an increase in the breakdown of fats by enzymes , which is induced by the hormone glucagon . At temperatures above 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) , an emperor penguin may become agitated as its body temperature and metabolic rate rise to increase heat loss . Raising its wings and exposing the undersides increases the exposure of its body surface to the air by 16 % , facilitating further heat loss . 
 = = = Adaptations to pressure and low oxygen = = = 
 In addition to the cold , the emperor penguin encounters another stressful condition on deep dives — markedly increased pressure of up to 40 times that of the surface , which in most other terrestrial organisms would cause barotrauma . The bones of the penguin are solid rather than air @-@ filled , which eliminates the risk of mechanical barotrauma . 
 While diving , the emperor penguin 's oxygen use is markedly reduced , as its heart rate is reduced to as low as 15 – 20 beats per minute and non @-@ essential organs are shut down , thus facilitating longer dives . Its haemoglobin and myoglobin are able to bind and transport oxygen at low blood concentrations ; this allows the bird to function with very low oxygen levels that would otherwise result in loss of consciousness . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The emperor penguin has a circumpolar distribution in the Antarctic almost exclusively between the 66 ° and 77 ° south latitudes . It almost always breeds on stable pack ice near the coast and up to 18 km ( 11 mi ) offshore . Breeding colonies are usually located in areas where ice cliffs and icebergs shelter them from the wind . Three land colonies have been reported : one ( now disappeared ) on a shingle spit at the Dion Islands on the Antarctic Peninsula , one on a headland at Taylor Glacier in the Australian Antarctic Territory , and most recently one at Amundsen Bay . Since 2009 , a number of colonies have been reported on shelf ice rather than sea ice , in some cases moving to the shelf in years when sea ice forms late . 
 The northernmost breeding population is on Snow Island , near the northern tip of the Peninsula . Individual vagrants have been recorded on Heard Island , South Georgia , and in New Zealand . 
 The total population was estimated in 2009 to be at around 595 @,@ 000 adult birds , in 46 known colonies spread around the Antarctic and sub @-@ Antarctic ; around 35 % of the known population lives north of the Antarctic Circle . Major breeding colonies were located at Cape Washington , Coulman Island in Victoria Land , Halley , Cape Colbeck , and Dibble Glacier . Colonies are known to fluctuate over time , often breaking into " suburbs " which move apart from the parent group , and some have been known to disappear entirely . The Cape Crozier colony on the Ross Sea dropped drastically in size between the first visits by the Discovery Expedition in 1902 – 03 and the later visits by the Terra Nova Expedition in 1910 – 11 ; it was reduced to a few hundred birds , and may have come close to extinction due to changes in the position of the ice shelf . By the 1960s it had rebounded dramatically , but by 2009 was again reduced to a small population of around 300 . 
 = = = Conservation status = = = 
 In 2012 the emperor penguin was uplisted from a species of least concern to near threatened by the IUCN . Along with nine other species of penguin , it is currently under consideration for inclusion under the US Endangered Species Act . The primary causes for an increased risk of species endangerment are declining food availability , due to the effects of climate change and industrial fisheries on the crustacean and fish populations . Other reasons for the species 's placement on the Endangered Species Act 's list include disease , habitat destruction , and disturbance at breeding colonies by humans . Of particular concern is the impact of tourism . One study concluded that emperor penguin chicks in a crèche become more apprehensive following helicopter approach to 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 281 ft ) . 
 Population declines of 50 % in the Terre Adélie region have been observed due to increased adult mortality , especially of males , during an abnormally prolonged warm period in the late 1970s , which resulted in reduced sea @-@ ice coverage . On the other hand , egg hatching success rates declined when the sea @-@ ice extent increased . The species is therefore considered to be highly sensitive to climatic changes . In 2009 , the Dion Islands colony , which has been extensively studied since 1948 , was reported to have disappeared at some point over the previous decade , the first confirmed loss of a colony . 
 A Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution study in January 2009 found that emperor penguins could be pushed to the brink of extinction by the year 2100 due to global climate change . The study constructed a mathematical model to predict how the loss of sea ice from climate warming would affect a big colony of emperor penguins at Terre Adélie , Antarctica . The study forecasted an 87 % decline in the colony 's population , from three thousand breeding pairs in 2009 to four hundred breeding pairs in 2100 . 
 In June 2014 a study by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution concluded that emperor penguins are at risk from global warming , which is melting the sea ice . This study predicted that by 2100 all 45 colonies of emperor penguins will be declining in numbers , mostly due to loss of habitat . Loss of ice reduces the supply of krill , which is a primary food for emperor penguins . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 The emperor penguin is a social animal in its nesting and its foraging behaviour ; birds hunting together may coordinate their diving and surfacing . Individuals may be active day or night . A mature adult travels throughout most of the year between the nesting area and ocean foraging areas ; the species disperses into the oceans from January to March . 
 The American physiologist Gerry <unk> revolutionized the study of penguin foraging behaviour in 1971 when he published his results from attaching automatic dive @-@ recording devices to emperor penguins . He found that the species reaches depths of 265 m ( 869 ft ) , with dive periods of up to 18 minutes . Later research revealed a small female had dived to a depth of 535 m ( 1 @,@ 755 ft ) near McMurdo Sound . It is possible that emperor penguins can dive even deeper , as the accuracy of the recording devices is diminished at greater depths . Further study of one bird 's diving behaviour revealed regular dives to 150 m ( 490 ft ) in water around 900 m ( 3 @,@ 000 ft ) deep , and shallow dives of less than 50 m ( 160 ft ) , interspersed with deep dives of more than 400 m ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) in depths of 450 to 500 m ( 1 @,@ 480 to 1 @,@ 640 ft ) . This was suggestive of feeding near or at the sea bottom . 
 Both male and female emperor penguins forage for food up to 500 km ( 311 mi ) from colonies while collecting food to feed chicks , covering 82 – 1 @,@ 454 km ( 51 – 903 mi ) per individual per trip . A male returning to the sea after incubation heads directly out to areas of permanent open water , known as <unk> , around 100 km ( 62 mi ) from the colony . 
 An efficient swimmer , the emperor penguin exerts pressure with both its upward and downward strokes while swimming . The upward stroke works against buoyancy and helps maintain depth . Its average swimming speed is 6 – 9 km / h ( 3 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 6 mph ) . On land , the emperor penguin alternates between walking with a wobbling gait and tobogganing — sliding over the ice on its belly , propelled by its feet and wing @-@ like flippers . Like all penguins , it is flightless . The emperor penguin is a very powerful bird . In one case , a crew of six men , trying to capture a single male penguin for a zoo collection , were repeatedly tossed around and knocked over before all of the men had to collectively tackle the bird , which weighs about half as much as a man . 
 As a defence against the cold , a colony of emperor penguins forms a compact huddle ( also known as the turtle formation ) ranging in size from ten to several hundred birds , with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour . As the wind chill is the least severe in the center of the colony , all the juveniles are usually huddled there . Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge , producing a slow churning action , and giving each bird a turn on the inside and on the outside . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The emperor penguin 's diet consists mainly of fish , crustaceans and cephalopods , although its composition varies from population to population . Fish are usually the most important food source , and the Antarctic silverfish ( <unk> <unk> ) makes up the bulk of the bird 's diet . Other prey commonly recorded include other fish of the family <unk> , the glacial squid ( <unk> glacialis ) , and the hooked squid species <unk> <unk> , as well as Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ) . The emperor penguin searches for prey in the open water of the Southern Ocean , in either ice @-@ free areas of open water or tidal cracks in pack ice . One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around 50 m ( 164 ft ) , where it can easily spot <unk> fish like the bald <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) swimming against the bottom surface of the sea @-@ ice ; it swims up to the bottom of the ice and catches the fish . It then dives again and repeats the sequence about half a dozen times before surfacing to breathe . 
 = = = Predators = = = 
 The emperor penguin 's predators include birds and aquatic mammals . Southern giant petrels ( <unk> giganteus ) are the predominant land predator of chicks , responsible for up to 34 % of chick deaths in some colonies though they often scavenge dead penguins as well . The south polar skua ( Stercorarius <unk> ) mainly scavenges for dead chicks , as the live chicks are too large to be attacked by the time of its annual arrival in the colony . Occasionally , a parent may defend their chick from attack , although it may be more passive if the chick is sickly . 
 The only known predators thought to attack healthy adults , and who attack emperor penguins in the water , are both mammals . The first is the leopard seal ( <unk> <unk> ) , which takes some adult birds , as well as fledglings soon after they enter the water . Orcas ( Orcinus orca ) , mostly take adult birds , although they will attack penguins of any age in or near water . 
 = = = Courtship and breeding = = = 
 Emperor penguins are able to breed at around three years of age , and usually commence breeding around one to three years later . The yearly reproductive cycle begins at the start of the Antarctic winter , in March and April , when all mature emperor penguins travel to colonial nesting areas , often walking 50 to 120 km ( 31 to 75 mi ) inland from the edge of the pack ice . The start of travel appears to be triggered by decreasing day lengths ; emperor penguins in captivity have been induced successfully into breeding by using lighting systems mimicking seasonal Antarctic day lengths . 
 The penguins start courtship in March or April , when the temperature can be as low as − 40 ° C ( − 40 ° F ) . A lone male gives an ecstatic display , where it stands still and places its head on its chest before inhaling and giving a courtship call for 1 – 2 seconds ; it then moves around the colony and repeats the call . A male and female then stand face to face , with one extending its head and neck up and the other mirroring it ; they both hold this posture for several minutes . Once in pairs , couples waddle around the colony together , with the female usually following the male . Before copulation , one bird bows deeply to its mate , its bill pointed close to the ground , and its mate then does the same . 
 Emperor penguins are serially monogamous . They have only one mate each year , and stay faithful to that mate . However , fidelity between years is only about 15 % . The narrow window of opportunity available for mating appears to be an influence , as there is a priority to mate and breed which often precludes waiting for the appearance of the previous year 's partner . 
 The female penguin lays one 460 – 470 g ( 1 @.@ 01 – 1 @.@ 04 lb ) egg in May or early June ; it is vaguely pear @-@ shaped , pale greenish @-@ white , and measures around 12 cm × 8 cm ( 4 3 ⁄ 4 in × 3 1 ⁄ 4 in ) . It represents just 2 @.@ 3 % of its mother 's body weight , making it one of the smallest eggs relative to the maternal weight in any bird species . 15 @.@ 7 % of the weight of an emperor penguin egg is shell ; like those of other penguin species , the shell is relatively thick , which minimizes risk of breakage . 
 After laying , the mother 's nutritional reserves are exhausted and she very carefully transfers the egg to the male , before immediately returning to the sea for two months to feed . The transfer of the egg can be awkward and difficult , and many couples drop the egg in the process . When this happens , the chick inside is quickly lost , as the egg cannot withstand the freezing temperatures on the icy ground . The male spends the dark winter incubating the egg in his brood pouch , balancing it on the tops of his feet , for 64 consecutive days until hatching . The emperor penguin is the only species where this behaviour is observed ; in all other penguin species both parents take shifts incubating . By the time the egg hatches , the male will have fasted for around 115 days since arriving at the colony . To survive the cold and winds of up to 200 km / h ( 120 mph ) , the males huddle together , taking turns in the middle of the huddle . They have also been observed with their backs to the wind to conserve body heat . In the four months of travel , courtship , and incubation , the male may lose as much as 20 kg ( 44 lb ) , from a total mass of 38 to 18 kg ( 84 to 40 lb ) . 
 Hatching may take as long as two or three days to complete , as the shell of the egg is thick . Newly hatched chicks are semi @-@ altricial , covered with only a thin layer of down and entirely dependent on their parents for food and warmth . If the chick hatches before the mother 's return , the father feeds it a curd @-@ like substance composed of 59 % protein and 28 % lipid , which is produced by a gland in his oesophagus . The young chick is brooded in what is called the guard phase , spending time balanced on its parent 's feet and sheltered in the brood pouch . 
 The female penguin returns at any time from hatching to ten days afterwards , from mid @-@ July to early August . She finds her mate among the hundreds of fathers by his vocal call and takes over caring for the chick , feeding it by regurgitating the food that she has stored in her stomach . The male then leaves to take his turn at sea , spending around 24 days there before returning . The parents then take turns , one brooding while the other forages at sea . If the incubating parent is not relieved by its partner before its own energy reserves are depleted , then it returns to the sea to re @-@ feed , abandoning its doomed egg or chick at the colony site . Abandoned chicks do not survive . 
 About 45 – 50 days after hatching , the chicks form a crèche , huddling together for warmth and protection . During this time , both parents forage at sea and return periodically to feed their chicks . A crèche may comprise up to several thousand birds densely packed together and is essential for surviving the low Antarctic temperatures . 
 From early November , chicks begin moulting into juvenile plumage , which takes up to two months and is often not completed by the time they leave the colony ; adults cease feeding them during this time . All birds make the considerably shorter trek to the sea in December or January and spend the rest of the summer feeding there .

 The species has been bred outside Antarctica at SeaWorld San Diego ; more than 20 individuals have hatched there since 1980 . Considered a flagship species , 55 individuals were counted in captivity in North American zoos and aquaria in 1999 . The first emperor penguin was hatched at <unk> Ocean Park in Dalian in northeastern China in August 2010 . In Japan , the species is housed at Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium and Wakayama Adventure World , with successful hatching in the latter place .

 In June 2011 , a juvenile emperor penguin was found on the beach at <unk> <unk> , north of Wellington in New Zealand . He had been consuming 3 kg of sand , which he had mistaken for snow , as well as sticks and stones , and had to undergo a number of operations to remove these and save his life . Following recovery , on 4 September , the juvenile , named " Happy Feet " ( after the 2006 film ) , was fitted with a tracking device and released into the Southern Ocean 80 km north of Campbell Island . However , 8 days later scientists lost contact with the bird , suggesting that the transmitter had fallen off ( considered likely ) or that he had been eaten by a predator ( considered less likely ) .

 The species ' unique life cycle in such a harsh environment has been described in print and visual media . Apsley Cherry @-@ Garrard , the Antarctic explorer , said : " Take it all in all , I do not believe anybody on Earth has a worse time than an emperor penguin " . Widely distributed in cinemas in 2005 , the French documentary La Marche de l 'empereur , which was also released with the English title March of the Penguins , told the story of the penguins ' reproductive cycle . The subject has been covered for the small screen four times by the BBC and presenter David Attenborough : first in episode five of the 1993 series on the Antarctic Life in the Freezer , again in the 2001 series The Blue Planet , once again in the 2006 series Planet Earth , and finally Frozen Planet in 2011 . 
 The computer @-@ animated movie Happy Feet ( 2006 ) features emperor penguins as its primary characters , with one in particular that loves to dance ; although a comedy , it too depicts their life cycle and promotes an underlying serious environmental message of threats from global warming and depletion of food sources by overfishing . The computer @-@ animated movie Surf 's Up ( 2007 ) features a surfing emperor penguin named Zeke " Big @-@ Z " Topanga . More than 30 countries have depicted the bird on their stamps – Australia , Great Britain , Chile and France have each issued several . It has also been depicted on a 1962 10 franc stamp as part of an Antarctic expedition series . Canadian band The Tragically Hip composed the song " Emperor Penguin " for their 1998 album Phantom Power . 
 = Alabama ( band ) = 
 Alabama is an American country , Southern rock and bluegrass band formed in Fort Payne , Alabama in 1969 . The band was founded by Randy Owen ( lead vocals , rhythm guitar ) and his cousin Teddy Gentry ( bass guitar , background vocals ) , soon joined by their other cousin , Jeff Cook ( lead guitar , fiddle , keyboards ) . First operating under the name Wildcountry , the group toured the Southeast bar circuit in the early 1970s , and began writing original songs . They changed their name to Alabama in 1977 and following the chart success of two singles , were approached by RCA Records for a record deal . 
 Alabama 's biggest success came in the 1980s , where the band had over 27 number one hits , seven multi @-@ platinum albums and received numerous awards . Alabama 's first single on RCA Records , " Tennessee River " , began a streak of number one singles , including " Love in the First Degree " ( 1981 ) , " Mountain Music " ( 1982 ) , " Dixieland Delight " ( 1983 ) , " If You 're Gonna Play in Texas ( You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band ) " ( 1984 ) and " Song of the South " ( 1987 ) . The group 's popularity waned slightly in the 1990s , although they continued to receive hit singles and multi @-@ platinum record sales . Alabama disbanded in 2006 following a farewell tour and two albums of inspirational music , but reunited in 2011 and have continued to record and tour worldwide . 
 The band 's blend of traditional country music and Southern rock combined with elements of gospel , and pop music gave it a crossover appeal that helped lead to their success . They also toured extensively and incorporated production elements such as lighting and " sets " inspired by rock concerts into their shows . The band has over 30 number one country records on the Billboard charts to their credit and have sold over 75 million records , making them one of the world 's best @-@ selling bands of all time . AllMusic credited the band with popularizing the idea of a country band , and wrote that " it 's unlikely that any other country group will be able to surpass the success of Alabama . " 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Formation and early years : 1969 – 79 = = = 
 Alabama was formed by guitarists Randy Owen and Jeff Cook , and bassist Teddy Gentry , three cousins born and raised near Fort Payne , Alabama , an area with strong country music roots . Owen and Gentry grew up on separate cotton farms on Lookout Mountain ( a plateau that stretches across northeastern Alabama , through northwest Georgia and into Tennessee ) , learning guitar together and singing in church before the age of six . Gentry and Owen played in numerous groups during the 1960s , ranging from pop to bluegrass . Cook joined the band in 1969 , forming the group Young Country , which first jammed together around Christmas . Cook also played in numerous bands and was a rock and roll disk jockey . The three cousins all shared vocal duties , with another cousin , drummer Jackie Owen , completing the group 's first lineup . The band 's first performance was at a high school talent contest ( playing a Merle Haggard song ) , for which they won first prize and tickets to the Grand Ole Opry . Despite this , all were busy with prior commitments to pursue music : Owen still in high school , Cook working for Western Electric , and Gentry laying carpets full @-@ time . The band grew further inactive when Cook went to college and Owen into the military . 
 The group became a professional band in 1972 , adding drummer Bennett Vartanian and changing their name to Wildcountry . During this time , the group accepted a position playing at the nearby <unk> theme park . The park would bring in established stars , such as Jerry Wallace , Bobby Bare , and Narvel Felts , and the band would back them , afterwards performing a one @-@ hour dance set . After a while , with opportunities for the band slim , a discouraged Cook took a government job in Anniston , Alabama . Owen was studying English at Jacksonville State University , and Cook had an electronics job . The trio shared at $ 56 @-@ a @-@ month apartment in Anniston , working to keep the band afloat with night and weekend gigs . The group decided to become professional musicians in 1973 , and began performing at bars throughout the Southeast . In March , the band relocated to Myrtle Beach , South Carolina , performing six nights a week at a club named The Bowery for tips . They made their best money performing cover songs of Lynyrd Skynyrd and Merle Haggard . The group could not secure a record contract , and began to self @-@ finance recordings . The group borrowed $ 4 @,@ 000 from a Fort Payne bank to record and release their own albums to sell at shows . Vartanian dropped out of the group , and following a rotation of four more drummers , they settled on Rick Scott in 1974 . 
 The group sent out demo tapes to record companies but received few responses until executives at GRT Records signed the band to a one @-@ record contract , issuing their debut single , " I Want to Be with You Tonight " , in 1977 . GRT was more interested in the band as songwriters , and convinced the group to change their name to the Alabama Band , later shortened to Alabama . The song only reached number 78 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts , and GRT declared bankruptcy the following year . Due to a hidden clause in their contract , Alabama was forbidden from recording with another label . For the next two years , the band raised money to buy out their contract , and they began recording again in 1979 . Following self @-@ recorded efforts Wildcountry ( 1976 ) and Deuces Wild ( 1977 ) , Alabama Band No. 3 became the band 's third album , and the band performed over 300 shows on the road that year . The group hired independent radio promoters to receive radio play for the single " I Wanna Come Over " , and they sent hand @-@ written letters to program directors and DJs nationwide . It received the attention of Dallas @-@ based <unk> Records , who signed the band . Scott left the group at this time , and was replaced by Mark Herndon , a rock drummer later credited with bringing the band their signature sound . " I Wanna Come Over " , became their first radio hit , reaching the top 40 in the Billboard country chart . 
 = = = Mainstream success and superstardom : 1980 – 85 = = = 
 The group 's next single , " My Home 's in Alabama " , received an even better response , reaching the top 20 . Their early chart successes led to an invitation to appear at the " New Faces " show at Nashville 's annual Country Radio Seminar , along with other new acts , such as Reba McEntire . The band had to perform with studio musicians , rather than as a band , and left the session believing they had destroyed their chances . Despite this , the group drew interest from several labels , among those RCA Records , with whom they signed in April 1980 . Their first single on RCA , " Tennessee River " , was produced by Harold Shedd and was their first to hit number one on the Billboard country chart , beginning a streak of over 30 number one hits . Cashbox named the band the New Vocal Group of the Year , marking the band 's first award . In July 1980 , the band left their long @-@ time gig at the Bowery , promoting their single , which they initially believed to be fluke . The success took the band by surprise , and soon became " all but consuming . " 
 Alabama enjoyed a great deal of creative freedom at RCA ; they followed up " Tennessee River " with " Why Lady Why " , despite the objections of executives and trade publications , The song became their second number one on the charts . They toured extensively , headlining small clubs and opening for bigger acts in major venues . In addition , the group also received television exposure on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and The Merv Griffin Show . In February 1981 , Alabama released its second major label album , Feels So Right ; it peaked at number 16 on the Billboard 200 and stayed for more than three years , longer than any other Alabama album . " Old Flame " was their next number one in February 1981 , followed by " Feels So Right " in May , and " Love in the First Degree " that October . That year , Alabama received a great deal of industry attention : Billboard named them New Group for the Year , Radio & Records called them Group of the Year , and the Academy of Country Music ( ACM ) deemed the band the Vocal Group of the Year . The quintet performed on the 1981 Country Music Association Awards , where it received both Instrumental Group of the Year and Vocal Group of the Year . Although the band received unprecedented success , Owen 's personal life was " falling apart " : his father died while he was on the road , affecting him greatly . 
 Mountain Music , released in February 1982 , is considered their final release before a significant upgrade in production and sound . All three of the album 's singles reached number one : " Mountain Music " in May 1982 , followed two months later by " Take Me Down " that July , and " Close Enough to Perfect " in October . That year , both Mountain Music and Feels So Right would go quadruple platinum ; by late 1982 , the band had sold over six million albums , despite just two years on the national circuit . " Christmas in Dixie " , a seasonal song released in 1982 , charted on two of Billboard magazine 's music popularity charts in six different calendar years . Alabama became the first group to win CMA 's prestigious Entertainer of the Year award , which they collected three years in a row , from 1982 to 1984 . The group received a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal , for Mountain Music . 
 The Closer You Get ... , released in March 1983 , was certified platinum within two months , and also won the Grammy for Best Country Performance . Each of the album 's singles — " Dixieland Delight " , " The Closer You Get " , and " Lady Down on Love " — were number ones in both the U.S. and Canada . Roll On was Alabama 's next LP , and its four singles , " Roll On ( Eighteen Wheeler ) " , " When We Make Love " , " If You 're Gonna Play in Texas ( You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band ) " , " ( There 's A ) Fire in the Night " , all went to the top in both countries . 40 @-@ Hour Week ( 1985 ) continued the band 's string of multinational successes , with " 40 Hour Week ( For a Livin ' ) " and " Can 't Keep a Good Man Down " peaking at number one in both territories , with only the lead single , " There 's No Way " , falling short in Canada ( although it peaked at number two ) . 40 @-@ Hour Week was one of Alabama 's most popular albums , crossing over in the pop album charts . Alabama Christmas , a collection of nine holiday songs plus " Christmas in Dixie " , became Alabama 's debut on the compact disc that September ; it was also the centerpiece of a retail and television promotion ( sponsored by the Nashville Network ) . 
 = = = Continued success : 1986 – 2002 = = = 
 RCA issued an Alabama Greatest Hits compilation in January 1986 , which went over five times platinum , making the band the most successful country act of the 1980s . The Touch followed in September 1986 , and although considered one of the weakest in the band 's catalogue , it did have two number one hits : " " You 've Got " the Touch " and " Touch Me When We 're Dancing " . Their next record , Just Us , received a similar critical response , but produced two number ones : " Face to Face " and " Fallin ' Again " . They also contributed their vocals to " Deep River Woman " , a single by Lionel Richie , from Richie 's third solo album Dancing on the Ceiling . Released in December 1986 , the single peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart and number 71 on the Hot 100 . 
 By the late 1980s , Alabama 's sales slowed down considerably , with only their major albums going gold . The group 's popularity was mostly eclipsed by more traditional @-@ sounding artists such as Ricky Skaggs , Randy Travis , George Strait , and Dwight Yoakam . Despite this , they continued to be a popular touring act , and the band issued their first live album , Alabama Live , in 1988 . For 1989 's Southern Star , the band decided to part ways with longtime producer Shedd , instead splitting production duties between Josh Leo and Larry Lee , and the other half with Barry Beckett . " Song of the South " was another number one , and the album 's remaining singles — " If I Had You " , " High Cotton " , and " Southern Star " — were number ones in both the U.S. and Canada . That year , Alabama were named by Billboard the Country Artist of the 1980s and the ACA voted the band the Artist of the Decade . 
 Although their popularity continued to decline during the 1990s , their albums still reached gold and platinum status . The 1990 album Pass It on Down featured three number one singles : " Jukebox in My Mind " , " Forever 's as Far as I 'll Go " , and " Down Home " . According to AllMusic , by the time the band released 1992 's American Pride , " they were among the genre 's aging veterans . " Richard Carlin of Country Music : A Biographical Dictionary , suggested that the group 's harmonies sounded dated to the new audience . " I 'm in a Hurry ( And Don 't Know Why ) " became the album 's biggest hit , reaching number one ; the album 's other singles still fared very well , with " Take a Little Trip " , " Once Upon a Lifetime " , and " Hometown Honeymoon " peaking within the top three . Cheap Seats followed in 1993 , with " Reckless " becoming Alabama 's final number one , although most of the band 's singles afterward peaked within the top ten . The band 's 1995 album , In Pictures , represented their eighteenth gold album , more than the total for any other country act to that point . In 1996 , the group remained finalists in the Vocal Group of the Year at the Country Music Association Awards . The band released Dancin ' on the Boulevard in 1997 , exploring R & B and beach music . Singles " Sad Lookin ' Moon " and " Dancin ' , <unk> ' on the Boulevard " were top five hits in the U.S. and Canada . The following year , the group released For the Record , a two @-@ disc greatest hits compilation that contained two new singles — " How Do You Fall in Love " and " Keepin ' Up " . Both new tracks were hits on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart , peaking at number two and fourteen , respectively . 
 For their fifteenth studio release , Twentieth Century ( 1999 ) , the band recorded a cover of " ( God Must Have Spent ) A Little More Time on You " by the boy band ' N Sync in 1999 , in a move that was considered an attempt to " stay relevant . " The single nonetheless hit number one in Canada , number three on the US country charts , and number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 . When It All Goes South ( 2001 ) followed in 2001 . " If I never did another CD , this is the one I will always point to as the one that I was happy with the most , " said Owen at the time of its release . Despite this , the album 's singles did not fare well in comparison to past successes , with only the title track becoming a top 15 hit , representing the band 's last career peak . 
 = = = Farewell tour and reunion : 2003 – present = = = 
 Alabama announced the American Farewell tour in May 2002 at the Country Music Association Awards ( CMAs ) , encompassing 40 tour dates , sponsorships , special events , and a TV special . Owen spoke then on the decision to part ways : " When you get down to it , there are many , many factors involved — some of them very personal . It 's really about the integrity of the group , the dignity of the group . " Owen later admitted the group was exhausted after twenty years of nonstop touring and recording , and " everybody needed some time . " The tour collected $ 15 million in box office before it even began , and Alabama performed to packed arenas from June to November 2003 . Due to " extraordinary fan response and overwhelming ticket demand , " the tour was extended for an additional 30 shows , running between February and June 2004 . The group performed their " final " show in October 2004 in Bismarck , North Dakota , with Herndon jokingly declaring " I need a job " as the concert closed . In the ensuing years , Owen stayed active as a solo act , Cook with his Allstar Goodtime Band and Gentry as a producer and with his band Rockit City . 
 Herndon and the other group members had had a difficult relationship during the band 's career . While he was present in each press photo and a photo of him once hung at Alabama 's fan club and museum , Owen contended that he was never an official member of the group . He claimed his inclusion in photos was the label 's idea , and that Herndon was a paid employee of the band , rather than a member . In May 2008 , the other members of the group sued drummer Mark Herndon for $ 202 @,@ 670 in money allegedly overpaid to him three years earlier after the band 's farewell tour concluded . This money was factored into the net profit and given to Herndon before accounting was completed , an allegation Herndon has denied . The band did not sue Herndon until he requested money from the multiple live albums and songs that the band had released but never paid Herndon for playing on . Owen stated that RCA desired Herndon in the band so their image could be comparable to the Beatles . Despite their troubles , he stated they had no hard feelings in an interview years later : " I don ’ t have one thing against him in any way in the world . " 
 Owen was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2010 , but he was later given a clean bill of health , which led to the band 's reunion , without Herndon . Following a series of tornados destroying homes and businesses throughout their state in 2011 , Alabama assembled a benefit concert in Birmingham , called Bama Rising . Featuring the band 's first set since 2004 , alongside Luke Bryan , Sheryl Crow and Brad Paisley , the concert raised $ 2 @.@ 1 million . " I guess we realized that maybe we missed the playing ... and five or six years had gone by and we were like , ' Maybe that wasn 't as bad as we remember it being , ' " said Gentry . In celebration of the group 's 40th anniversary , Alabama resumed touring in 2013 for the Back to the Bowery tour , referencing the Myrtle Beach club where they first became professional musicians . They also undertook a short cruise , The Alabama & Friends Festival at Sea , which left for the Bahamas on Norwegian Cruise Line 's Norwegian Pearl ship . In addition , the band released Alabama & Friends , a tribute album encompassing covers from newer artists such as Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia Line , in addition to two new tracks by Alabama . 
 The band released their first new studio album in 14 years , Southern Drawl , on September 18 , 2015 via BMG Chrysalis . 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Alabama 's music mixes both country , rock , and pop , particularly evident in their musical concept : the group was one of the first country bands to achieve significant airplay . Despite their influences from other genres , the band was most inspired by country music , which is most evident in their " harmonies , songwriting , and approach . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes that the band is " indebted to country , particularly the Bakersfield sound of Merle Haggard , bluegrass , and the sound of Nashville pop . " The band echoed its country upbringing in one of its first trade articles : " We 're country first and crossover second . If crossovers come , that 's great , but we 'd rather have a No. 1 @.@ country song than be lost in the middle of both country and pop charts , " said Owen . 
 By the mid @-@ 1980s , the band increasingly moved toward a general pop @-@ rock sound , " going for <unk> productions with a more heavily amplified sound . " Alabama 's lyrics often centered on their homeland . Their first hit single , " Tennessee River " , recounts being " born across the river in the mountains I call home , " while " Dixieland Delight " chronicles cruising down a rural Tennessee byway .

 Alabama has been credited with " substantially broadening country 's audience while becoming one of the most popular acts in American musical history " by Michael McCall of The Encyclopedia of Country Music . The band was notable for its three @-@ person lead ( as " most other country acts focused on a soloist accompanied by an anonymous band " ) , their collective hair length and facial hair ( which would have been deemed unacceptable just a decade earlier ) , and their prominent electric bass and drums . They had a slightly edgier sound than other groups , and both played their own instruments and wrote their own songs . Alabama mostly appealed to a younger audience , although their clean @-@ cut image appealed to the more conservative , older country audience as well . Kurt Wolff described the band 's appeal : " They 're just rebel enough for the young folks , but their parents also dig the boys ' pretty harmonies , sentimental soft spots , and old @-@ fashioned family values . " Alabama gave prominence to their hometown of Fort Payne , and also raised awareness for environmental issues . 
 The band 's incorporation of rock and roll into their sound was an inspiration for groups such as Restless Heart , Shenandoah , Exile , Diamond Rio , Lonestar , Ricochet , and the Mavericks . According to Irwin Stambler and <unk> Landon , authors of Country Music : The Encyclopedia , the group 's diminishing sales in the late 1980s reflected competition from country bands that would not have received recognition had it not been for Alabama paving the way . For their part , these groups credited Alabama with providing a massive influence on their careers . Prior to Alabama 's unprecedented chart success , most country hit singles belonged to solo artists or duets . Many Alabama singles and albums represented crossover appeal on the pop charts . 
 Despite their successes , Alabama 's career was loathed by music critics of the day , citing the " vacuous songs and watered @-@ down , middle @-@ of @-@ the @-@ road arrangements " that blurred lines between country and pop . The Baltimore Sun once argued the band " render [ s ] country music all but indistinguishable from pop " and thus " trivializes some of country 's most hallowed traditions . " Indeed , reviewers such as Wolff consider the band 's " overriding problem " their calculated sound , which leads many contemporary music critics to label the band mediocre .

 = Brockway Mountain Drive = 
 Brockway Mountain Drive is an 8 @.@ 883 @-@ mile ( 14 @.@ 296 km ) scenic roadway just west of Copper Harbor in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the United States . Drivers can access the road from state highway M @-@ 26 on either end near Eagle Harbor to the west or Copper Harbor to the east in the Keweenaw Peninsula . The drive runs along the ridge of Brockway Mountain on the Keweenaw Fault and climbs to 1 @,@ 320 feet ( 402 m ) above sea level , 720 feet ( 220 m ) above the surface of Lake Superior . Several viewpoints along the route allow for panoramas of Copper Harbor , Lake Superior , and undeveloped woodland . On a clear day , Isle Royale is visible approximately 50 miles ( 80 km ) in distance from the top of the mountain . 
 Brockway Mountain was named for Daniel D. Brockway , one of the pioneer residents of the area . The road was constructed by the county road commission with funding through Depression @-@ era work programs in 1933 . It was briefly used as a connection for the parallel state highway after it opened . Since it opened , Brockway Mountain Drive has been recognized nationally and locally in several media outlets for its picturesque qualities , usually in profiles of Keweenaw County , the Upper Peninsula or other scenic drives . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The road can be accessed from either Eagle Harbor or Copper Harbor and serves as a scenic loop off M @-@ 26 . The western end starts at M @-@ 26 near Lake Bailey and Agate Harbor . Brockway Mountain Drive ascends along the ridgeline of the Keweenaw Fault . Immediately south of the road , Upson Creek runs parallel to the cliff face as it drains Lake Upson . Two and a half miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) from the western end , there is a parking area for the Oren Krumm Trail , part of the Brockway Mountain Audubon Sanctuary . The drive is lined with low stone walls , built as part of the original construction of the roadway . 
 Upon reaching the top of the mountain , drivers are greeted with a full panoramic view of the surrounding area , allowing views of Lake Superior , Copper Harbor , Eagle Harbor and the surrounding lakes and forests . Freighters occasionally can be seen traversing Lake Superior , and on clear days Isle Royale can be spotted nearly 50 miles ( 80 km ) in the distance . 
 Continuing eastward , the drive descends down the mountain toward Copper Harbor . The roadway twists and turns as it alternately climbs and descends several smaller hills along the ridgeline . Along the drive , several viewpoints provide the opportunity to pull off and take in the surroundings . A few of them lie directly adjacent to the face of the bluff where the mountain quickly rises from the surrounding land . Near the eastern end , there are two sharp hairpin turns , the first of which has a scenic overlook and parking area . This spot overlooks Copper Harbor and the nearby Copper Country Trail National Scenic Byway portion of US Highway 41 ( US 41 ) just to the east . From here , the road makes its steep descent down from the ridge , through the second turn and ends at M @-@ 26 on the western edge of town . 
 This road is one of the highest scenic roadways above sea level in the US between the Rocky and Allegheny mountains . During the winter , Brockway Mountain Drive is closed to cars as the Keweenaw County Road Commission does not plow the road ; instead the drive is used as a snowmobile trail . According to the commission , 200 vehicles per day use the roadway on average . There are no posted speed limits along the roadway , however in the words of a former Keweenaw County Sheriff 's Department deputy , " the nature and design of the road was such that the ' problem ' of people driving too fast ... was basically ' self @-@ correcting ' . " 
 = = History = = 
 Brockway Mountain is a 1 @,@ 320 @-@ foot ( 400 m ) volcanic landform on the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan about five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) west of Copper Harbor . The top of the mountain is 720 feet ( 220 m ) above the level of Lake Superior . The peak was named for Daniel D. Brockway , local pioneer settler , postmaster and state road commissioner . Brockway moved to Copper Harbor in 1846 at the beginning of the area 's copper boom . He built the first permanent structure in the community , a hostelry named The Brockway House , which was used by the miners and scientists in the area . By the time of his death on May 9 , 1899 , the ridge west of town had been named in his honor . 
 A road to the summit of Brockway Mountain was first proposed in the 1920s by Warren H. Manning , a renowned landscape architect . Manning was in the Keweenaw at the time to design Agassiz Park in Calumet and suggested the road while visiting the area . The road was designed in 1932 with three different options considered . The first involved the construction of the current road from near the Silver River on the west to the summit . It followed a route used by the previous Military Road that connected Fort Wilkins to Fort Howard ; traffic would have to turn around to descend Brockway Mountain . Another option included a route from the summit southwest across the Upson Creek Valley to a second summit on the nearby Mount Lookout , a total of about 16 miles ( 26 km ) . The third option was that of the current route down the mountain to the west . 
 Construction of Brockway Mountain Drive began in early 1933 by the Keweenaw County Road Commission with federal highway funding designed to provide meaningful work to the many copper miners who became unemployed during the Great Depression . Rather than provide welfare , the government provided work for the jobless . The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was the agency on the federal level responsible for the project . Up to 300 laborers were employed for a wage of 25 ¢ / hr ( equivalent to $ 4 @.@ 57 / hr in 2015 ) . The work required to build the road was carried out by manual labor , with the assistance of a team of horses , in a project designed to maximize the numbers of men employed . The grading and leveling of the road surface was done by hand ; no survey instruments were used to level the roadway . The road was opened for public use that October 14 , at a preliminary cost of $ 30 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 3 @.@ 68 million in 2015 ) . That same year , the Skytop Inn opened on top of the mountain . During 1934 , additional work was done to the roadway to build the stone walls . Motorists were restricted to one @-@ way traffic , and the road was only open to the public on Sundays and holidays . In the interim , the road was temporarily used as a connection between completed segments of the parallel state highway , numbered M @-@ 129 at the time . This highway , now part of M @-@ 26 , was built starting in July 1933 but was not completed through the area until October 1934 . The KCRC declared the road initially finished on June 14 , 1935 , at a cost of $ 40 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 3 @.@ 83 million in 2015 ) 
 According to historian LeRoy Barnett , " this county highway quickly became one of the most popular motoring destinations in the Midwest . " The Ironwood Daily Globe reported that in December 1938 , " at least one million persons " had traveled on Brockway Mountain Drive in the first five years it was open , sparking a tourism boom in the area . The eastern end of the roadway was paved in 1938 , with the final two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) done in 1940 . The first Skytop Inn was built at the summit of Brockway Mountain in 1935 . A replacement structure was built in 1965 . During the first few winters of 1946 / 47 and 1947 / 48 , a ski hill was operated down the roadway on the western end . 
 In February 2013 , Eagle Harbor Township purchased 320 acres ( 130 ha ) at the top of Brockway Mountain with plans to refit the Skytop Inn to serve as a visitors center . The building was the oldest gift shop in Keweenaw County and owned by the same family from the time of its construction until it was sold in 2013 . The following August , Governor Rick Snyder helped to dedicate the summit as part of the Keweenaw Coastal Wildlife Corridor , a protected area in the raptors ' annual migration flight path . The area is now owned by the township after assistance by The Nature Conservancy and local donors .

 During the spring , particularly in April , hawks migrate along the length of the Keweenaw Peninsula headed across Lake Superior . They flock together along the cliffs and ridges of Brockway Mountain . The top of the mountain is a semi @-@ alpine climate with strong winds , and guide books advise visitors to bring <unk> jackets , even in the summer . The peak is also known as an excellent star @-@ gazing location because there are no electric lights to interrupt the darkness . The surrounding mountainsides are privately owned , mostly by Champion International Paper . The company receives reduced taxes in exchange for keeping the land open for recreational uses . The Michigan Nature Association owns 200 acres ( 81 ha ) of property on Brockway Mountain itself . There are over 700 species of flowers including trillium and orchids . The peak bloom is in June , and some of the wildflowers on display are not found elsewhere in the state . Motorcycle Cruiser magazine featured a piece on Copper Harbor in February 2010 that suggested visiting Brockway Mountain at dawn saying that " the vista at the peak is amazing and it 's worth the early morning rise . " The area is renowned as a fall foliage destination ; color season starts by the second week of September and ends in October .

 Many locales in the Keweenaw Peninsula are frequently praised for their beauty and pristine appearances and Brockway Mountain Drive is no exception . The road has been recognized in numerous publications , dating back to the 1950s . The Milwaukee Sentinel profiled the " famous Brockway Mountain Drive " in 1956 in an article about a tourism boom to the region . More attention was focused on the roadway when Milwaukee 's other newspaper , the Milwaukee Journal , spotlighted the region in 1961 stating , " the road along the Brockway Mountain fault follows the Keweenaw Peninsula 700 ft [ 210 m ] above Lake Superior , past ghost copper mines [ toward ] restored Fort Wilkins " . The New York Times had similar praise in 1962 , saying " a side trip that should not be missed is the Brockway Mountain Drive ... for a panoramic view of the forest and the blue waters of Lake Superior . " The Chicago Tribune called the overlook " breathtaking " in 1986 , and the Chicago Sun @-@ Times said that views from Brockway " rival [ ed ] any in New England " in 1990 . The Pioneer Press of St. Paul profiled the area in 2005 saying that the tourists " cruise along Brockway Mountain Drive , renowned for fall color . " The staff of <unk> , the online news presence of Booth Newspapers in Michigan , highlighted the height of the roadway , the view to Isle Royale , and the birdwatching opportunities in a profile of the area in 2007 . 
 In April 1994 and April 2001 , the route along US 41 and Brockway Mountain Drive was selected as " one of the best fall color views and mountain biking areas " by Michigan Living . It was also named the " most beautiful bike ride in the United States " by Bicycling magazine in February 1995 . The Star Tribune in Minneapolis said that a visit to the drive " is worth the whole trip by itself , with a twisting road leading up to the crest , with panoramic views of fall colors . " The drive was also included in the coverage of the Copper Country Trail , a designation applied to the neighboring US 41 by the Federal Highway Administration as a part of the National Scenic Byway program . NBC 's Today featured Brockway Mountain Drive in September 2007 as part of a segment on " great and unusual fall foliage destinations " . In May 2010 , local residents of the Upper Peninsula chose the road as the region 's " favorite natural wonder " in a poll conducted by WLUC @-@ TV .

 = Dopamine = 
 Dopamine ( contracted from 3 @,@ 4 @-@ <unk> ) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays several important roles in the brain and body . It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L @-@ DOPA , which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys . Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most multicellular animals . 
 In the brain , dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter — a chemical released by neurons ( nerve cells ) to send signals to other nerve cells . The brain includes several distinct dopamine pathways , one of which plays a major role in reward @-@ motivated behavior . Most types of reward increase the level of dopamine in the brain , and most addictive drugs increase dopamine neuronal activity . Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones . These pathways and cell groups form a dopamine system which is <unk> . 
 Outside the central nervous system , dopamine functions in several parts of the peripheral nervous system as a local chemical messenger . In blood vessels , it inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator ( at normal concentrations ) ; in the kidneys , it increases sodium excretion and urine output ; in the pancreas , it reduces insulin production ; in the digestive system , it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa ; and in the immune system , it reduces the activity of lymphocytes . With the exception of the blood vessels , dopamine in each of these peripheral systems is synthesized locally and exerts its effects near the cells that release it . 
 Several important diseases of the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system , and some of the key medications used to treat them work by altering the effects of dopamine . Parkinson 's disease , a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment , is caused by a loss of dopamine @-@ secreting neurons in an area of the midbrain called the substantia nigra . Its metabolic precursor L @-@ DOPA can be manufactured , and in its pure form marketed as Levodopa is the most widely used treatment for the condition . There is evidence that schizophrenia involves altered levels of dopamine activity , and most antipsychotic drugs used to treat this are dopamine antagonists which reduce dopamine activity . Similar dopamine antagonist drugs are also some of the most effective anti @-@ nausea agents . Restless legs syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) are associated with decreased dopamine activity . Dopaminergic stimulants can be addictive in high doses , but some are used at lower doses to treat ADHD . Dopamine itself is available as a manufactured medication for intravenous injection : although it cannot reach the brain from the bloodstream , its peripheral effects make it useful in the treatment of heart failure or shock , especially in newborn babies . 
 = = Structure = = 
 A dopamine molecule consists of a catechol structure ( a benzene ring with two hydroxyl side groups ) with one amine group attached via an ethyl chain . As such , dopamine is the simplest possible catecholamine , a family that also includes the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and epinephrine . The presence of a benzene ring with this amine attachment makes it a substituted phenethylamine , a family that includes numerous psychoactive drugs . 
 Like most amines , dopamine is an organic base . As a base , it is generally protonated in acidic environments ( in an acid @-@ base reaction ) . The protonated form is highly water @-@ soluble and relatively stable , but can become oxidized if exposed to oxygen or other oxidants . In basic environments , dopamine is not protonated . In this free base form , it is less water @-@ soluble and also more highly reactive . Because of the increased stability and water @-@ solubility of the protonated form , dopamine is supplied for chemical or pharmaceutical use as dopamine hydrochloride — that is , the hydrochloride salt that is created when dopamine is combined with hydrochloric acid . In dry form , dopamine hydrochloride is a fine colorless powder . 
 = = Biochemistry = = 
 = = = Synthesis = = = 
 Dopamine is synthesized in a restricted set of cell types , mainly neurons and cells in the medulla of the adrenal glands . The metabolic pathway is : 
 L @-@ Phenylalanine → L @-@ Tyrosine → L @-@ DOPA → Dopamine 
 The direct precursor of dopamine , L @-@ DOPA , can be synthesized indirectly from the essential amino acid phenylalanine or directly from the non @-@ essential amino acid tyrosine . These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and so are readily available in food , with tyrosine being the most common . Although dopamine is also found in many types of food , it is incapable of crossing the blood – brain barrier that surrounds and protects the brain . It must therefore be synthesized inside the brain to perform its neuronal activity . 
 L @-@ Phenylalanine is converted into L @-@ tyrosine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase , with molecular oxygen ( O2 ) and tetrahydrobiopterin as cofactors . L @-@ Tyrosine is converted into L @-@ DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase , with tetrahydrobiopterin , O2 , and iron ( Fe2 + ) as cofactors . L @-@ DOPA is converted into dopamine by the enzyme aromatic L @-@ amino acid decarboxylase ( also known as DOPA decarboxylase ) , with pyridoxal phosphate as the cofactor . 
 Dopamine itself is used as precursor in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters ( and hormones ) norepinephrine and epinephrine . Dopamine is converted into norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine β @-@ hydroxylase , with O2 and L @-@ ascorbic acid as cofactors . Norepinephrine is converted into epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N @-@ methyltransferase with S @-@ adenosyl @-@ L @-@ methionine as the cofactor . 
 Some of the cofactors also require their own synthesis . Deficiency in any required amino acid or cofactor can impair the synthesis of dopamine , norepinephrine , and epinephrine . 
 = = = Degradation = = = 
 Dopamine is broken down into inactive metabolites by a set of enzymes — monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) , catechol @-@ O @-@ methyl transferase ( COMT ) , and aldehyde dehydrogenase , acting in sequence . Both isoforms of monoamine oxidase , MAO @-@ A and MAO @-@ B , effectively metabolize dopamine . Different breakdown pathways exist but the main end @-@ product is homovanillic acid , which has no known biological activity . From the bloodstream , homovanillic acid is filtered out by the kidneys and then excreted in the urine . 
 In clinical research on schizophrenia , measurements of homovanillic acid in plasma have been used to estimate levels of dopamine activity in the brain . A difficulty in this approach however , is separating the high level of plasma homovanillic acid contributed by the metabolism of norepinephrine . 
 Although dopamine is normally broken down by an oxidoreductase enzyme , it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen , yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products . The rate of oxidation can be increased by the presence of ferric iron or other factors . Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells , and there is evidence that this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson 's disease and other conditions . 
 = = Functions = = 
 = = = Cellular effects = = = 
 Dopamine exerts its effects by binding to and activating cell surface receptors . In mammals , five subtypes of dopamine receptors have been identified , labeled from D1 to D5 . All of them function as metabotropic , G protein @-@ coupled receptors , meaning that they exert their effects via a complex second messenger system . These receptors can be divided into two families , known as D1 @-@ like and D2 @-@ like . For receptors located on neurons in the nervous system , the ultimate effect of D1 @-@ like activation ( D1 and D5 ) can be excitation ( via opening of sodium channels ) or inhibition ( via opening of potassium channels ) ; the ultimate effect of D2 @-@ like activation ( D2 , D3 , and D4 ) is usually inhibition of the target neuron . Consequently , it is incorrect to describe dopamine itself as either excitatory or inhibitory : its effect on a target neuron depends on which types of receptors are present on the membrane of that neuron and on the internal responses of that neuron to the second messenger cAMP . D1 receptors are the most numerous dopamine receptors in the human nervous system ; D2 receptors are next ; D3 , D4 , and D5 receptors are present at significantly lower levels . 
 = = = = Storage , release , and reuptake = = = = 
 Inside the brain , dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator , and is controlled by a set of mechanisms common to all monoamine neurotransmitters . After synthesis , dopamine is transported from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles by a solute carrier — a vesicular monoamine transporter , VMAT2 . Dopamine is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the synaptic cleft . In most cases , the release of dopamine occurs through a process called exocytosis which is caused by action potentials , but it can also be caused by the activity of an intracellular trace amine @-@ associated receptor , TAAR1 . TAAR1 is a high @-@ affinity receptor for dopamine , trace amines , and certain substituted amphetamines that is located along membranes in the intracellular milieu of the presynaptic cell ; activation of the receptor can regulate dopamine signaling by producing reuptake inhibition and neurotransmitter efflux and inhibiting neuronal firing through a diverse set of mechanisms . 
 Once in the synapse , dopamine binds to and activates dopamine receptors . These can be postsynaptic dopamine receptors , which are located on dendrites ( the postsynaptic neuron ) , or presynaptic autoreceptors ( e.g. , the <unk> and presynaptic D3 receptors ) , which are located on the membrane of an axon terminal ( the presynaptic neuron ) . After the postsynaptic neuron elicits an action potential , dopamine molecules quickly become unbound from their receptors . They are then absorbed back into the presynaptic cell , via reuptake mediated either by the dopamine transporter or by the plasma membrane monoamine transporter . Once back in the cytosol , dopamine can either be broken down by a monoamine oxidase or repackaged into vesicles by VMAT2 , making it available for future release . 
 In the brain the level of extracellular dopamine is modulated by two mechanisms : phasic and tonic transmission . <unk> dopamine release , like most neurotransmitter release in the nervous system , is driven directly by action potentials in the dopamine @-@ containing cells . Tonic dopamine transmission occurs when small amounts of dopamine are released without being preceded by presynaptic action potentials . Tonic transmission is regulated by a variety of factors , including the activity of other neurons and neurotransmitter reuptake . 
 = = = Nervous system = = = 
 Inside the brain , dopamine plays important roles in executive functions , motor control , motivation , arousal , reinforcement , and reward , as well as lower @-@ level functions including lactation , sexual gratification , and nausea . The dopaminergic cell groups and pathways make up the dopamine system which is <unk> . 
 Dopaminergic neurons ( dopamine @-@ producing nerve cells ) are comparatively few in number — a total of around 400 @,@ 000 in the human brain — and their cell bodies are confined in groups to a few relatively small brain areas . However their axons project to many other brain areas , and they exert powerful effects on their targets . These dopaminergic cell groups were first mapped in 1964 by <unk> Dahlström and Kjell <unk> , who assigned them labels starting with the letter " A " ( for " aminergic " ) . In their scheme , areas A1 through A7 contain the neurotransmitter norepinephrine , whereas A8 through A14 contain dopamine . The dopaminergic areas they identified are the substantia nigra ( groups 8 and 9 ) ; the ventral tegmental area ( group 10 ) ; the posterior hypothalamus ( group 11 ) ; the arcuate nucleus ( group 12 ) ; the zona incerta ( group 13 ) and the periventricular nucleus ( group 14 ) . 
 The substantia nigra is a small midbrain area that forms a component of the basal ganglia . This has two parts — an input area called the pars compacta and an output area the pars reticulata . The dopaminergic neurons are found mainly in the pars compacta ( cell group A8 ) and nearby ( group A9 ) . In humans , the projection of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta to the dorsal striatum , termed the nigrostriatal pathway , plays a significant role in the control of motor function and in learning new motor skills . These neurons are especially vulnerable to damage , and when a large number of them die , the result is a parkinsonian syndrome . 
 The ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) is another midbrain area . The most prominent group of VTA dopaminergic neurons projects to the prefrontal cortex via the <unk> pathway and another smaller group projects to the nucleus accumbens via the mesolimbic pathway . Together , these two pathways are collectively termed the mesocorticolimbic projection . The VTA also sends dopaminergic projections to the amygdala , cingulate gyrus , hippocampus , and olfactory bulb . <unk> neurons play a central role in reward and other aspects of motivation . 
 The posterior hypothalamus has dopamine neurons that project to the spinal cord , but their function is not well established . There is some evidence that pathology in this area plays a role in restless legs syndrome , a condition in which people have difficulty sleeping due to an overwhelming compulsion to constantly move parts of the body , especially the legs . 
 The arcuate nucleus and the periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus have dopamine neurons that form an important projection — the <unk> pathway which goes to the pituitary gland , where it influences the secretion of the hormone prolactin . Dopamine is the primary neuroendocrine inhibitor of the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland . Dopamine produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus is secreted into the <unk> portal system of the median eminence , which supplies the pituitary gland . The prolactin cells that produce prolactin , in the absence of dopamine , secrete prolactin continuously ; dopamine inhibits this secretion . In the context of regulating prolactin secretion , dopamine is occasionally called prolactin @-@ inhibiting factor , prolactin @-@ inhibiting hormone , or <unk> . 
 The zona incerta , grouped between the arcuate and periventricular nuclei , projects to several areas of the hypothalamus , and participates in the control of gonadotropin @-@ releasing hormone , which is necessary to activate the development of the male and female reproductive systems , following puberty . 
 An additional group of dopamine @-@ secreting neurons is found in the retina of the eye . These neurons are <unk> cells , meaning that they have no axons . They release dopamine into the extracellular medium , and are specifically active during daylight hours , becoming silent at night . This retinal dopamine acts to enhance the activity of cone cells in the retina while suppressing rod cells — the result is to increase sensitivity to color and contrast during bright light conditions , at the cost of reduced sensitivity when the light is dim . 
 = = = = Basal ganglia = = = = 
 The largest and most important sources of dopamine in the vertebrate brain are the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area . These structures are closely related to each other and functionally similar in many respects . Both are components of the basal ganglia , a complex network of structures located mainly at the base of the forebrain . The largest component of the basal ganglia is the striatum . The substantia nigra sends a dopaminergic projection to the dorsal striatum , while the ventral tegmental area sends a similar type of dopaminergic projection to the ventral striatum . 
 Progress in understanding the functions of the basal ganglia has been slow . The most popular hypotheses , broadly stated , propose that the basal ganglia play a central role in action selection . The action selection theory in its simplest form proposes that when a person or animal is in a situation where several behaviors are possible , activity in the basal ganglia determines which of them is executed , by releasing that response from inhibition while continuing to inhibit other motor systems that if activated would generate competing behaviors . Thus the basal ganglia , in this concept , are responsible for initiating behaviors , but not for determining the details of how they are carried out . In other words , they essentially form a decision @-@ making system . 
 The basal ganglia can be divided into several sectors , and each is involved in controlling particular types of actions . The ventral sector of the basal ganglia ( containing the ventral striatum and ventral tegmental area ) operates at the highest level of the hierarchy , selecting actions at the whole @-@ organism level . The dorsal sectors ( containing the dorsal striatum and substantia nigra ) operate at lower levels , selecting the specific muscles and movements that are used to implement a given behavior pattern . 
 Dopamine contributes to the action selection process in at least two important ways . First , it sets the " threshold " for initiating actions . The higher the level of dopamine activity , the lower the impetus required to evoke a given behavior . As a consequence , high levels of dopamine lead to high levels of motor activity and impulsive behavior ; low levels of dopamine lead to torpor and slowed reactions . Parkinson 's disease , in which dopamine levels in the substantia nigra circuit are greatly reduced , is characterized by stiffness and difficulty initiating movement — however , when people with the disease are confronted with strong stimuli such as a serious threat , their reactions can be as vigorous as those of a healthy person . In the opposite direction , drugs that increase dopamine release , such as cocaine or amphetamine , can produce heightened levels of activity , including at the extreme , psychomotor agitation and stereotyped movements . 
 The second important effect of dopamine is as a " teaching " signal . When an action is followed by an increase in dopamine activity , the basal ganglia circuit is altered in a way that makes the same response easier to evoke when similar situations arise in the future . This is a form of operant conditioning , in which dopamine plays the role of a reward signal . 
 = = = = Reward = = = = 
 In the reward system , reward is the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior ( also known as approach behavior ) – and consummatory behavior . A rewarding stimulus is one that has the potential to cause an approach to it and a choice to be made to consume it or not . Pleasure , learning ( e.g. , classical and operant conditioning ) , and approach behavior are the three main functions of reward . As an aspect of reward , pleasure provides a definition of reward ; however , while all pleasurable stimuli are rewarding , not all rewarding stimuli are pleasurable ( e.g. , <unk> rewards like money ) . The motivational or desirable aspect of rewarding stimuli is reflected by the approach behavior that they induce , whereas the pleasurable component of <unk> rewards is derived from the consummatory behavior that ensues upon acquiring them . A neuropsychological model which distinguishes these two components of an intrinsically rewarding stimulus is the incentive salience model , where " wanting " or desire ( less commonly , " seeking " ) corresponds to appetitive or approach behavior while " liking " or pleasure corresponds to consummatory behavior . In human drug addicts , " wanting " becomes dissociated with " liking " as the desire to use an addictive drug increases , while the pleasure obtained from consuming it decreases due to drug tolerance . 
 Within the brain , dopamine functions partly as a " global reward signal " , where an initial phasic dopamine response to a rewarding stimulus encodes information about the salience , value , and context of a reward . In the context of reward @-@ related learning , dopamine also functions as a reward prediction error signal , that is , the degree to which the value of a reward is unexpected . According to this hypothesis of Wolfram Schultz , rewards that are expected do not produce a second phasic dopamine response in certain dopaminergic cells , but rewards that are unexpected , or greater than expected , produce a short @-@ lasting increase in synaptic dopamine , whereas the omission of an expected reward actually causes dopamine release to drop below its background level . The " prediction error " hypothesis has drawn particular interest from computational neuroscientists , because an influential computational @-@ learning method known as temporal difference learning makes heavy use of a signal that encodes prediction error . This confluence of theory and data has led to a fertile interaction between neuroscientists and computer scientists interested in machine learning . 
 Evidence from <unk> recordings from the brains of animals shows that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) and substantia nigra are strongly activated by a wide variety of rewarding events . These reward @-@ responsive dopamine neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra are crucial for reward @-@ related cognition and serve as the central component of the reward system . The function of dopamine varies in each axonal projection from the VTA and substantia nigra ; for example , the VTA – nucleus accumbens shell projection assigns incentive salience ( " want " ) to rewarding stimuli and its associated cues , the VTA – orbitofrontal cortex projection updates the value of different goals in accordance with their incentive salience , the VTA – amygdala and VTA – hippocampus projections mediate the consolidation of reward @-@ related memories , and both the VTA – nucleus accumbens core and substantia nigra – dorsal striatum pathways are involved in learning motor responses that facilitate the acquisition of rewarding stimuli . Some activity within the VTA dopaminergic projections appears to be associated with reward prediction as well . 
 While dopamine has a central role in mediating " wanting " — associated with the appetitive or approach behavioral responses to rewarding stimuli , detailed studies have shown that dopamine cannot simply be equated with " liking " or pleasure , as reflected in the consummatory behavioral response . Dopamine neurotransmission is involved in some but not all aspects of pleasure @-@ related cognition , since pleasure centers have been identified both within the dopamine system ( i.e. , nucleus accumbens shell ) and outside the dopamine system ( i.e. , ventral pallidum and <unk> nucleus ) . For example , direct electrical stimulation of dopamine pathways , using electrodes implanted in the brain , is experienced as pleasurable , and many types of animals are willing to work to obtain it . Antipsychotic drugs used to treat psychosis reduce dopamine levels and tend to cause anhedonia , a diminished ability to experience pleasure . Many types of pleasurable experiences — such as sex , enjoying food , or playing video games — increase dopamine release . All addictive drugs directly or indirectly affect dopamine neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens ; these drugs increase drug " wanting " , leading to compulsive drug use , when repeatedly taken in high doses , presumably through the sensitization of incentive @-@ salience . Drugs that increase dopamine release include stimulants such as methamphetamine or cocaine . These produce increases in " wanting " behaviors , but do not greatly alter expressions of pleasure or change levels of satiation . However , opiate drugs such as heroin or morphine produce increases in expressions of " liking " and " wanting " behaviors . Moreover , animals in which the ventral tegmental dopamine system has been rendered inactive do not seek food , and will starve to death if left to themselves , but if food is placed in their mouths they will consume it and show expressions indicative of pleasure . 
 = = = Outside the nervous system = = = 
 Dopamine does not cross the blood – brain barrier , so its synthesis and functions in peripheral areas are to a large degree independent of its synthesis and functions in the brain . A substantial amount of dopamine circulates in the bloodstream , but its functions there are not entirely clear . Dopamine is found in blood plasma at levels comparable to those of epinephrine , but in humans , over 95 % of the dopamine in the plasma is in the form of dopamine sulfate , a conjugate produced by the enzyme <unk> 1A3 / <unk> acting on free dopamine . The bulk of this dopamine sulfate is produced in the mesentery that surrounds parts of the digestive system . The production of dopamine sulfate is thought to be a mechanism for detoxifying dopamine that is ingested as food or produced by the digestive process — levels in the plasma typically rise more than fifty @-@ fold after a meal . Dopamine sulfate has no known biological functions and is excreted in urine . 
 The relatively small quantity of unconjugated dopamine in the bloodstream may be produced by the sympathetic nervous system , the digestive system , or possibly other organs . It may act on dopamine receptors in peripheral tissues , or be metabolized , or be converted to norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine beta hydroxylase , which is released into the bloodstream by the adrenal medulla . Some dopamine receptors are located in the walls of arteries , where they act as a vasodilator and an inhibitor of norepinephrine release . These responses might be activated by dopamine released from the carotid body under conditions of low oxygen , but whether arterial dopamine receptors perform other biologically useful functions is not known . 
 Beyond its role in modulating blood flow , there are several peripheral systems in which dopamine circulates within a limited area and performs an exocrine or <unk> function . The peripheral systems in which dopamine plays an important role include the immune system , the kidneys and the pancreas . 
 In the immune system dopamine acts upon receptors present on immune cells , especially lymphocytes . Dopamine can also affect immune cells in the spleen , bone marrow , and circulatory system . In addition , dopamine can be synthesized and released by immune cells themselves . The main effect of dopamine on lymphocytes is to reduce their activation level . The functional significance of this system is unclear , but it affords a possible route for interactions between the nervous system and immune system , and may be relevant to some autoimmune disorders . 
 The renal dopaminergic system is located in the cells of the <unk> in the kidney , where all subtypes of dopamine receptors are present . Dopamine is also synthesized there , by tubule cells , and discharged into the tubular fluid . Its actions include increasing the blood supply to the kidneys , increasing the glomerular filtration rate , and increasing the excretion of sodium in the urine . Hence , defects in renal dopamine function can lead to reduced sodium excretion and consequently result in the development of high blood pressure . There is strong evidence that faults in the production of dopamine or in the receptors can result in a number of pathologies including oxidative stress , edema , and either genetic or essential hypertension . Oxidative stress can itself cause hypertension . Defects in the system can also be caused by genetic factors or high blood pressure . 
 In the pancreas the role of dopamine is somewhat complex . The pancreas consists of two parts , an exocrine and an endocrine component . The exocrine part synthesizes and secretes digestive enzymes and other substances , including dopamine , into the small intestine . The function of this secreted dopamine after it enters the small intestine is not clearly established — the possibilities include protecting the intestinal mucosa from damage and reducing gastrointestinal motility ( the rate at which content moves through the digestive system ) . 
 The pancreatic islets make up the endocrine part of the pancreas , and synthesize and secrete hormones including insulin into the bloodstream . There is evidence that the beta cells in the islets that synthesize insulin contain dopamine receptors , and that dopamine acts to reduce the amount of insulin they release . The source of their dopamine input is not clearly established — it may come from dopamine that circulates in the bloodstream and derives from the sympathetic nervous system , or it may be synthesized locally by other types of pancreatic cells . 
 = = Medical uses = = 
 Dopamine as a manufactured medication is sold under the trade names <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , among others . It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines . It is most commonly used as a stimulant drug in the treatment of severe low blood pressure , slow heart rate , and cardiac arrest . It is especially important in treating these in newborn infants . It is given intravenously . Since the half @-@ life of dopamine in plasma is very short — approximately one minute in adults , two minutes in newborn infants and up to five minutes in preterm infants — it is usually given in a continuous intravenous drip rather than a single injection . 
 Its effects , depending on dosage , include an increase in sodium excretion by the kidneys , an increase in urine output , an increase in heart rate , and an increase in blood pressure . At low doses it acts through the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart muscle contraction force and heart rate , thereby increasing cardiac output and blood pressure . Higher doses also cause vasoconstriction that further increases blood pressure . Older literature also describes very low doses thought to improve kidney function without other consequences , but recent reviews have concluded that doses at such low levels are not effective and may sometimes be harmful . While some effects result from stimulation of dopamine receptors , the prominent cardiovascular effects result from dopamine acting at α1 , β1 , and β2 adrenergic receptors . 
 Side effects of dopamine include negative effects on kidney function and irregular heartbeats . The LD50 , or lethal dose which is expected to prove fatal in 50 % of the population , has been found to be : 59 mg / kg ( mouse ; administered intravenously ) ; 950 mg / kg ( mouse ; administered intraperitoneally ) ; 163 mg / kg ( rat ; administered intraperitoneally ) ; 79 mg / kg ( dog ; administered intravenously ) . 
 A fluorinated form of L @-@ DOPA known as <unk> is available for use in positron emission tomography to assess the function of the nigrostriatal pathway . 
 = = Disease , disorders , and pharmacology = = 
 The dopamine system plays a central role in several significant medical conditions , including Parkinson 's disease , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , schizophrenia , and addiction . Aside from dopamine itself , there are many other important drugs that act on dopamine systems in various parts of the brain or body . Some are used for medical or recreational purposes , but <unk> have also developed a variety of research drugs , some of which bind with high affinity to specific types of dopamine receptors and either agonize or antagonize their effects , and many that affect other aspects of dopamine physiology , including dopamine transporter inhibitors , VMAT inhibitors , and enzyme inhibitors . 
 = = = Aging brain = = = 
 A number of studies have reported an age @-@ related decline in dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor density ( i.e. , the number of receptors ) in the brain . This decline has been shown to occur in the striatum and <unk> regions . Decreases in the D1 , D2 , and D3 receptors are well documented . The reduction of dopamine with aging is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age , such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity . Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age @-@ related changes in cognitive flexibility . 
 Other neurotransmitters , such as serotonin and glutamate also show a decline in output with aging . 
 = = = Parkinson 's disease = = = 
 Parkinson 's disease is an age @-@ related disorder characterized by movement disorders such as stiffness of the body , slowing of movement , and trembling of limbs when they are not in use . In advanced stages it progresses to dementia and eventually death . The main symptoms are caused by the loss of dopamine @-@ secreting cells in the substantia nigra . These dopamine cells are especially vulnerable to damage , and a variety of insults , including encephalitis ( as depicted in the book and movie " <unk> " ) , repeated sports @-@ related concussions , and some forms of chemical poisoning such as <unk> , can lead to substantial cell loss , producing a parkinsonian syndrome that is similar in its main features to Parkinson 's disease . Most cases of Parkinson 's disease , however , are idiopathic , meaning that the cause of cell death cannot be identified . 
 The most widely used treatment for parkinsonism is administration of L @-@ DOPA , the metabolic precursor for dopamine . L @-@ DOPA is converted to dopamine in the brain and various parts of the body by the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase . L @-@ DOPA is used rather than dopamine itself because , unlike dopamine , it is capable of crossing the blood @-@ brain barrier . It is often co @-@ administered with an enzyme inhibitor of peripheral decarboxylation such as carbidopa or benserazide , to reduce the amount converted to dopamine in the periphery and thereby increase the amount of L @-@ DOPA that enters the brain . When L @-@ DOPA is administered regularly over a long time period , a variety of unpleasant side effects such as dyskinesia often begin to appear ; even so , it is considered the best available long @-@ term treatment option for most cases of Parkinson 's disease . 
 L @-@ DOPA treatment cannot restore the dopamine cells that have been lost , but it causes the remaining cells to produce more dopamine , thereby compensating for the loss to at least some degree . In advanced stages the treatment begins to fail because the cell loss is so severe that the remaining ones cannot produce enough dopamine regardless of L @-@ DOPA levels . Other drugs that enhance dopamine function , such as <unk> and <unk> , are also sometimes used to treat <unk> , but in most cases L @-@ DOPA appears to give the best trade @-@ off between positive effects and negative side @-@ effects . 
 Dopaminergic medications that are used to treat Parkinson 's disease are sometimes associated with the development of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome , which involves the overuse of dopaminergic medication and medication @-@ induced compulsive engagement in natural rewards like gambling and sexual activity . The latter behaviors are similar to those observed in individuals with a behavioral addiction . 
 = = = Drug addiction and psychostimulants = = = 
 Cocaine , substituted amphetamines ( including methamphetamine ) , Adderall , methylphenidate ( marketed as Ritalin or <unk> ) , MDMA ( ecstasy ) and other psychostimulants exert their effects primarily or partly by increasing dopamine levels in the brain by a variety of mechanisms . Cocaine and methylphenidate are dopamine transporter blockers or reuptake inhibitors ; they non @-@ competitively inhibit dopamine reuptake , resulting in increased dopamine concentrations in the synaptic cleft . Like cocaine , substituted amphetamines and amphetamine also increase the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft , but by different mechanisms . 
 The effects of psychostimulants include increases in heart rate , body temperature , and sweating ; improvements in alertness , attention , and endurance ; increases in pleasure produced by rewarding events ; but at higher doses agitation , anxiety , or even loss of contact with reality . Drugs in this group can have a high addiction potential , due to their activating effects on the dopamine @-@ mediated reward system in the brain . However some can also be useful , at lower doses , for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and narcolepsy . An important differentiating factor is the onset and duration of action . Cocaine can take effect in seconds if it is injected or inhaled in free base form ; the effects last from 5 to 90 minutes . This rapid and brief action makes its effects easily perceived and consequently gives it high addiction potential . Methylphenidate taken in pill form , in contrast , can take two hours to reach peak levels in the bloodstream , and depending on formulation the effects can last for up to 12 hours . These slow and sustained actions reduce the addiction potential and make it more useful for treating ADHD . 
 A variety of addictive drugs produce an increase in reward @-@ related dopamine activity . Stimulants such as nicotine , cocaine and methamphetamine promote increased levels of dopamine which appear to be the primary factor in causing addiction . For other addictive drugs such as the opioid heroin , the increased levels of dopamine in the reward system may only play a minor role in addiction . When people addicted to stimulants go through withdrawal , they do not experience the physical suffering associated with alcohol withdrawal or withdrawal from opiates ; instead they experience craving , an intense desire for the drug characterized by irritability , restlessness , and other arousal symptoms , brought about by psychological dependence . 
 The dopamine system plays a crucial role in several aspects of addiction . At the earliest stage , genetic differences that alter the expression of dopamine receptors in the brain can predict whether a person will find stimulants appealing or aversive . Consumption of stimulants produces increases in brain dopamine levels that last from minutes to hours . Finally , the chronic elevation in dopamine that comes with repetitive high @-@ dose stimulant consumption triggers a wide @-@ ranging set of structural changes in the brain that are responsible for the behavioral abnormalities which characterize an addiction . Treatment of stimulant addiction is very difficult , because even if consumption ceases , the craving that comes with psychological withdrawal does not . Even when the craving seems to be extinct , it may re @-@ emerge when faced with stimuli that are associated with the drug , such as friends , locations and situations . Association networks in the brain are greatly interlinked . 
 = = = Psychosis and antipsychotic drugs = = = 
 Psychiatrists in the early 1950s discovered that a class of drugs known as typical antipsychotics ( also known as major tranquilizers ) , were often effective at reducing the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia . The introduction of the first widely used antipsychotic , chlorpromazine ( Thorazine ) , in the 1950s , led to the release of many patients with schizophrenia from institutions in the years that followed . By the 1970s researchers understood that these typical antipsychotics worked as antagonists on the D2 receptors . This realization led to the so @-@ called dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia , which postulates that schizophrenia is largely caused , by hyperactivity of brain dopamine systems . The dopamine hypothesis drew additional support from the observation that psychotic symptoms were often intensified by dopamine @-@ enhancing stimulants such as methamphetamine , and that these drugs could also produce psychosis in healthy people if taken in large enough doses . In the following decades other atypical antipsychotics that had fewer serious side effects were developed . Many of these newer drugs do not act directly on dopamine receptors , but instead produce alterations in dopamine activity indirectly . These drugs were also used to treat other psychoses . Antipsychotic drugs have a broadly suppressive effect on most types of active behavior , and particularly reduce the delusional and agitated behavior characteristic of overt psychosis . There remains substantial dispute , however , about how much of an improvement the patient experiences on these drugs . 
 Later observations , however , have caused the dopamine hypothesis to lose popularity , at least in its simple original form . For one thing , patients with schizophrenia do not typically show measurably increased levels of brain dopamine activity . Also , other dissociative drugs , notably ketamine and phencyclidine that act on glutamate NMDA receptors ( and not on dopamine receptors ) can produce psychotic symptoms . Perhaps most importantly , those drugs that do reduce dopamine activity are a very imperfect treatment for schizophrenia : they only reduce a subset of symptoms , while producing severe short @-@ term and long @-@ term side effects . Even so , many psychiatrists and neuroscientists continue to believe that schizophrenia involves some sort of dopamine system dysfunction . As the " dopamine hypothesis " has evolved over time , however , the sorts of dysfunctions it postulates have tended to become increasingly subtle and complex . 
 However , the widespread use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial . There are several reasons for this . First , antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who have to take them , because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure . Second , it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior . Third , they can produce a range of serious side effects , including weight gain , diabetes , fatigue , sexual dysfunction , hormonal changes , and a type of serious movement disorder known as <unk> dyskinesia . Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use , or even permanently . 
 = = = Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder = = = 
 Altered dopamine neurotransmission is implicated in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , a condition associated with impaired cognitive control , in turn leading to problems with regulating attention ( attentional control ) , inhibiting behaviors ( inhibitory control ) , and forgetting things or missing details ( working memory ) , among other problems . There are genetic links between dopamine receptors , the dopamine transporter , and ADHD , in addition to links to other neurotransmitter receptors and transporters . The most important relationship between dopamine and ADHD involves the drugs that are used to treat ADHD . Some of the most effective therapeutic agents for ADHD are psychostimulants such as methylphenidate ( Ritalin , <unk> ) and amphetamine ( Adderall , Dexedrine ) , drugs that increase both dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain . The clinical effects of these psychostimulants in treating ADHD are mediated through the indirect activation of dopamine and norepinephrine receptors , specifically dopamine receptor D1 and adrenoceptor A2 , in the prefrontal cortex . 
 = = = Pain = = = 
 Dopamine plays a role in pain processing in multiple levels of the central nervous system including the spinal cord , <unk> gray , thalamus , basal ganglia , and cingulate cortex . Decreased levels of dopamine have been associated with painful symptoms that frequently occur in Parkinson 's disease . Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission also occur in several painful clinical conditions , including burning mouth syndrome , fibromyalgia , and restless legs syndrome . 
 = = = Nausea = = = 
 Nausea and vomiting are largely determined by activity in the area <unk> in the medulla of the brainstem , in a region known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone . This area contains a large population of type D2 dopamine receptors . Consequently , drugs that activate D2 receptors have a high potential to cause nausea . This group includes some medications that are administered for Parkinson 's disease , as well as other dopamine agonists such as apomorphine . In some cases , D2 @-@ receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide are useful as anti @-@ nausea drugs . 
 = = Comparative biology and evolution = = 
 = = = Microorganisms = = = 
 There are no reports of dopamine in archaea , but it has been detected in some types of bacteria and in the protozoan called <unk> . Perhaps more importantly , there are types of bacteria that contain homologs of all the enzymes that animals use to synthesize dopamine . It has been proposed that animals derived their dopamine @-@ synthesizing machinery from bacteria , via horizontal gene transfer that may have occurred relatively late in evolutionary time , perhaps as a result of the symbiotic incorporation of bacteria into eukaryotic cells that gave rise to mitochondria . 
 = = = Animals = = = 
 Dopamine is used as a neurotransmitter in most multicellular animals . In sponges there is only a single report of the presence of dopamine , with no indication of its function ; however , dopamine has been reported in the nervous systems of many other radially symmetric species , including the cnidarian jellyfish , hydra and some corals . This dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of the nervous system , over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian era . Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates , echinoderms , arthropods , molluscs , and several types of worm . 
 In every type of animal that has been examined , dopamine has been seen to modify motor behavior . In the model organism , nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , it reduces locomotion and increases food @-@ exploratory movements ; in flatworms it produces " screw @-@ like " movements ; in leeches it inhibits swimming and promotes crawling . Across a wide range of vertebrates , dopamine has an " activating " effect on behavior @-@ switching and response selection , comparable to its effect in mammals . 
 Dopamine has also consistently been shown to play a role in reward learning , in all animal groups . As in all vertebrates – invertebrates such as roundworms , flatworms , molluscs and common fruit flies can all be trained to repeat an action if it is consistently followed by an increase in dopamine levels . 
 It had long been believed that arthropods were an exception to this with dopamine being seen as having an adverse effect . Reward was seen to be mediated instead by octopamine , a neurotransmitter closely related to norepinephrine . More recent studies however have shown that dopamine does play a part in reward learning in fruit flies . Also it has been found that the rewarding effect of octopamine is due to its activating a set of dopaminergic neurons not previously accessed in the research . 
 = = = Plants = = = 
 Many plants , including a variety of food plants , synthesize dopamine to varying degrees . The highest concentrations have been observed in bananas — the fruit pulp of red and yellow bananas contains dopamine at levels of 40 to 50 parts per million by weight . Potatoes , avocados , broccoli , and Brussels sprouts may also contain dopamine at levels of 1 part per million or more ; oranges , tomatoes , spinach , beans , and other plants contain measurable concentrations less than 1 part per million . The dopamine in plants is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine , by biochemical mechanisms similar to those that animals use . It can be metabolized in a variety of ways , producing melanin and a variety of alkaloids as byproducts . The functions of plant catecholamines have not been clearly established , but there is evidence that they play a role in the response to stressors such as bacterial infection , act as growth @-@ promoting factors in some situations , and modify the way that sugars are metabolized . The receptors that mediate these actions have not yet been identified , nor have the intracellular mechanisms that they activate . 
 Dopamine consumed in food cannot act on the brain , because it cannot cross the blood – brain barrier . However , there are also a variety of plants that contain L @-@ DOPA , the metabolic precursor of dopamine . The highest concentrations are found in the leaves and bean pods of plants of the genus <unk> , especially in <unk> <unk> ( velvet beans ) , which have been used as a source for L @-@ DOPA as a drug . Another plant containing substantial amounts of L @-@ DOPA is Vicia faba , the plant that produces fava beans ( also known as " broad beans " ) . The level of L @-@ DOPA in the beans , however , is much lower than in the pod shells and other parts of the plant . The seeds of Cassia and Bauhinia trees also contain substantial amounts of L @-@ DOPA . 
 In a species of marine green algae <unk> obscura , a major component of some algal blooms , dopamine is present in very high concentrations , estimated at 4 @.@ 4 % of dry weight . There is evidence that this dopamine functions as an anti @-@ herbivore defense , reducing consumption by snails and isopods . 
 = = = As a precursor for melanin = = = 
 <unk> are a family of dark @-@ pigmented substances found in a wide range of organisms . Chemically they are closely related to dopamine , and there is a type of melanin , known as dopamine @-@ melanin , that can be synthesized by oxidation of dopamine via the enzyme tyrosinase . The melanin that darkens human skin is not of this type : it is synthesized by a pathway that uses L @-@ DOPA as a precursor but not dopamine . However , there is substantial evidence that the <unk> that gives a dark color to the brain 's substantia nigra is at least in part dopamine @-@ melanin . 
 Dopamine @-@ derived melanin probably appears in at least some other biological systems as well . Some of the dopamine in plants is likely to be used as a precursor for dopamine @-@ melanin . The complex patterns that appear on butterfly wings , as well as black @-@ and @-@ white stripes on the bodies of insect larvae , are also thought to be caused by spatially structured accumulations of dopamine @-@ melanin . 
 = = History and development = = 
 Dopamine was first synthesized in 1910 by George Barger and James <unk> at Wellcome Laboratories in London , England and first identified in the human brain by Kathleen Montagu in 1957 . It was named dopamine because it is a monoamine whose precursor in the Barger @-@ <unk> synthesis is 3 @,@ 4 @-@ dihydroxyphenylalanine ( levodopa or L @-@ DOPA ) . Dopamine 's function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils @-@ Åke <unk> at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of Sweden . Carlsson was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing that dopamine is not only a precursor of norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) and epinephrine ( adrenaline ) , but is also itself a neurotransmitter . 
 = = = Polydopamine = = = 
 Research motivated by adhesive <unk> proteins in mussels led to the discovery in 2007 that a wide variety of materials , if placed in a solution of dopamine at slightly basic pH , will become coated with a layer of polymerized dopamine , often referred to as <unk> . This polymerized dopamine forms by a spontaneous oxidation reaction , and is formally a type of melanin . Synthesis usually involves reaction of dopamine hydrochloride with Tris as a base in water . The structure of <unk> is unknown . 
 Polydopamine coatings can form on objects ranging in size from nanoparticles to large surfaces . Polydopamine layers have chemical properties that have the potential to be extremely useful , and numerous studies have examined their possible applications . At the simplest level , they can be used for protection against damage by light , or to form capsules for drug delivery . At a more sophisticated level , their adhesive properties may make them useful as substrates for biosensors or other biologically active macromolecules . 
 = California State Route 139 = 
 State Route 139 ( SR 139 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California . Running from SR 36 in Susanville north to Oregon Route 39 , it forms part of the shortest route between Reno , Nevada , and Klamath Falls , Oregon . SR 139 cuts through much Modoc National Forest and passes near Antelope Mountain and Tule Lake . The entire route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System , but is a two @-@ lane road . North of the SR 299 overlap , SR 139 is an eligible State Scenic Highway , but has not been designated as such ; the short piece north of <unk> is however part of the federal Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway . The portion north of SR 299 is also in the Interregional Road System as a High Emphasis Route and in the National Highway System . North of SR 299 , the highway was built by the federal government and turned over to the state in about 1940 ; the remainder was built by a joint highway district of Lassen and Modoc Counties , completed in 1956 , and given to the state in 1959 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 State Route 139 begins at SR 36 in Susanville , and heads northeast up Antelope Mountain along the eastern edge of Susanville Ranch Park before turning north and descending into the Eagle Lake Basin , passing along the eastern edge of Eagle Lake and later the Said Valley Reservoir . The highway continues north and northwest through valleys and over hills and through a part of the Modoc National Forest , through the community of Avila Place , and then enters the east end of the Big Valley , where it begins to overlap SR 299 through Adin . The combined routes continue northerly through another part of the forest and over Adin Pass into the Warm Springs Valley , where SR 139 splits to the northwest near Canby . 
 SR 139 runs northwest and north over mostly flat terrain through the center of the national forest and the communities of Ambrose and Perez before turning northwest . The route continues through <unk> , Newell , Stronghold , Homestead , and Tuber before cutting across the intermittent Tule Lake as the Lava Beds Highway through the city of <unk> to the Oregon state line at Hatfield . At an intersection right on the state line , SR 161 begins to the west , and Oregon Route 39 continues northwest towards Klamath Falls . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1925 , a state @-@ created " California Highway Advisory Committee " recommended a number of additions to the state highway system ; among these was a route from Susanville to the Oregon state line towards Klamath Falls , via Bieber . This would be part of a road connecting Reno , Nevada and Klamath Falls east of the Sierra Nevada , which would attract heavy traffic and improve access to Crater Lake and Lassen Volcanic National Parks . A local county road already followed this path , but it was unpaved , mostly dirt and gravel but with sections of rock and bad sand . This was close to the present SR 139 , with notable deviations around the areas of Hayden Hill , Bieber and Lookout , and Malin , Oregon ( as Tule Lake covered SR 139 's current location ) . 
 By the mid @-@ 1920s , the main road southeast from Klamath Falls , still unimproved in California , headed southeast to State Highway Route 28 ( now SR 299 ) at Canby rather than south to Bieber . There travelers could head east on Route 28 to Alturas and south on the present US 395 ( not a state highway north of Susanville until 1933 ) towards Reno . The California state legislature passed a law in 1939 , providing for state takeover of the Canby @-@ Oregon road if the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Public Roads were to construct and pave it . The road was in fact mostly paved by mid @-@ 1939 , and under construction or completed by mid @-@ 1940 , when Oregon Route 58 opened , continuing the corridor northwest from Klamath Falls . In 1943 the legislature gave it the Route 210 designation ; Oregon had added the short connecting Hatfield Highway to its state highway system in 1937 . 
 Lassen and Modoc Counties organized Joint Highway District No. 14 on December 21 , 1929 to construct and maintain a road from Susanville via Adin to Oregon . However , since the state took over the part north of Adin , the district 's scope was narrowed to Susanville @-@ Adin . It finally completed work in 1956 , and held a ceremony on August 26 , in which it placed a monument at a point near Eagle Lake . The legislature added the road to the state highway system as Route 216 in 1959 . The portion south of Horse Lake Road became an extension of Route 20 instead ; this route from Susanville to <unk> ( later <unk> ) was never constructed by the state , and was deleted from SR 36 in 1998 . Also in 1959 , a spur of Route 210 west to Dorris was added ; this became SR 161 in 1964 . 
 By 1946 , the Canby @-@ Oregon portion had been marked as Sign Route 139 , connecting with Oregon Route 39 ; it was extended south over US 299 to Adin and Routes 216 and 20 to Susanville by 1960 . The number was legislatively adopted , replacing Routes 210 and 216 , in the 1964 renumbering . It has remained a two @-@ lane road , despite being added to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 ( Canby to Oregon ) and 1965 ( Susanville to Adin ) .

 = Actor Rebellion of 1733 = 
 The Actor Rebellion of 1733 was an event that took place at the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane in London , England when the actors who worked there , disapproving of the changes in the management , attempted to seize control . Before the rebellion , the theatre was controlled by the managers Theophilus Cibber , John Ellys , and John Highmore . When Theophilus lost his share and was denied a bid to run the theatre , he , along with other actors , attempted to take over the theatre by controlling the lease . When the shareholders found out , they refused to admit the actors to the building and the theatre was closed for several months . The fight spilled over to the contemporary newspapers , which generally sided with the managers . 
 The Theatre Royal reopened on 24 September 1733 with a new company of actors , though they were less experienced and talented than the old crew . The majority of old actors moved to the Little Theatre , Haymarket , though a few remained loyal . Henry Fielding sided with the managers and produced several plays to aid the Theatre Royal , though this caused a backlash when the rebelling actors finally won the dispute . By the end of 1733 , the rebellious actors managed to seize legal control of the theatre 's property and Highmore , the sole manager of the Theatre Royal at the time , lost all legal abilities to stop them . By February 1734 , he sold his shares to Charles Fleetwood who then made an agreement with the actors that secured their return .

It was operated by Christopher Rich from 1693 until 1714 . He was replaced after his death by three actors , Colley Cibber , Thomas Doggett , and Robert Wilks . After Doggett died , Barton Booth took over his share . In 1730 , a notice in the Daily Journal stated that a patent would be issued to Booth , Cibber , and Wilks authorising the official government license to run the Theatre Royal . After bureaucratic delays , the official patent was given to the three managers only in 1732 that was to last for 21 years . On 13 July 1732 , Booth , in poor health , decided to sell half of his share to Highmore , a fellow actor and a socialite . On 27 September , Wilks died and his share was inherited by his widow , who then authorised Ellys , a painter , to serve in her place . In reaction to the changing partners , Colley Cibber rented his share to his son Theophilus , an actor . 
 The new management group had two members , Highmore and Ellys , who were incompetent and Theophilus Cibber was known to be both arrogant and volatile . By the end of 1732 , there were problems with the management of the theatre , which resulted in the failure of Charles Johnson 's <unk> : or , The <unk> Lover on 4 December . The 8 March 1733 Grub @-@ Street Journal seized on the event and used the failure to criticise the theatre 's management : " how insufficient the present managers of Drury @-@ lane playhouse are to discharge their trust , as directors of our public entertainments . " The newspaper was not the only group concerned and many plays were soon cancelled . 
 Matters were complicated by mass illnesses spreading across London ; the epidemic , probably flu , reduced the number of actors able to work and many plays were cancelled . Even Henry Fielding 's play The Miser , which was to open early January , was postponed because of the poor health of its cast members , including Theophilus . The Miser was eventually staged in mid February and was successful , but another of his plays , Deborah : or , a Wife for You All , lasted only one night on 6 April 1733 . Regardless of the problems plaguing the season , it was positive for Fielding while it lasted , with six of his plays being produced on stage along with Thomas Arne 's The Opera of Operas , Fielding 's Tom Thumb set to music . 
 = = Management changes = = 
 Highmore and Ellys , both gentlemen and not actors , insisted on actively participating in every day @-@ to @-@ day decisions regarding scheduling , choice of plays , expenses , actors ' behaviour . Their management style clashed with Theophilus , when he recovered and returned in February . They denied his play The Harlot 's Progress instead putting a play by Ellys . The fighting between the managers coincided with poor attendance from both the epidemic in London and other theatres attracting audiences with popular operatic performances . Theophilus 's play The Mock @-@ Officer failed , which caused Highmore and Ellys to turn further against him . However , his 31 March 1733 The Harlot 's Progress , based on William Hogarth 's painting of the same name , proved to be very successful and embarrassed the two other managers . 
 While Theophilus Cibber was disputing with Highmore and Ellys , Aaron Hill became interested in partnering at the Theatre Royal . Hill was earlier a partner at the theatre until he was removed during a previous actor riot that took place in June 1710 . On 22 March 1733 , Hill , in a letter to Benjamin Victor , a dramatist who had arranged the sale of Booth 's shares to Highmore , criticised the fact that he was kept from buying into the theatre 's management and attacked Theophilus . He offered 900 pounds for three years for Booth 's shares and 1800 pounds for Mary Wilks 's shares . Negotiations continued until May when they were dropped . Hester Booth , widow of Barton Booth , sold her remaining shares to Henry Giffard , the manager of Goodman 's Fields Theatre , just few days after her husband died on 10 May . 
 By this time , many of the partners , including Wilks , Ellys , and Colley Cibber , no longer wanted to be a part of the theatre and sought to sell their shares . When Colley sought to rent out his share to his son for 300 pounds a year , Highmore approached Colley in order to buy . News of Colley 's selling of the shares to Highmore first appeared in the Daily Post of 27 March 1733 . The sale price was around 3000 guineas and 3500 pounds . Theophilus was upset that his father sold the share to Highmore instead of continuing to rent it out to himself . The share , as Theophilus believed , was his " Birthright " . 
 = = Rebellion = = 
 Theophilus first tried to work with Highmore and asked to run the operations of the theatre . However , he was turned down , which provoked him to stir the actors into a rebellion . Many of the actors were upset about the management changes and theatre 's operations . Highmore did not have experience in theatre , refused to listen to actors ' ideas , and cut their salaries in half . Theophilus was known as a successful manager and a good actor . The rebellious actors ' plan was to take over the lease and then deny the use of the building to the shareholders , who did not own the complex that they set their stage in . The actors would then use their control over the building to negotiate renting of the patent so they could control how the theatre was run . 
 When the actors tried to rent the building , the remaining shareholders found out about it . They responded by refusing admittance to the actors . The building was shut down and no plays were performed . According to the Daily Post of 29 May 1733 : 
 the Occasion we are inform 'd was , that at Midnight on Saturday last several Persons arm 'd took Possession of the same , by Direction from some of the Patentees , and lock 'd up and <unk> 'd all the Doors and Entrances thereunto , against the whole Company of his Majesty 's Comedians , as also against Mr. Cibber , <unk> notwithstanding he had paid to one of the Patentees several Hundred Pounds for one third Part of the Patent , <unk> , Scenes , & c. and all Rights and Privileges thereunto annexed , for a certain Term not yet expired . 
 The actors petitioned Charles FitzRoy , 2nd Duke of Grafton , the Lord Chamberlain , and requested that he settle the dispute , but he refused to involve himself in the matter . By early June , the actors had control of the theatre through the lease , but the management refused to leave . The actors tried to file for the management to be legally removed from the property , but the court system was slow to respond . 
 The management continued to cause problems for various actors , including Benjamin Griffin . Griffin was fired from the theatre on 4 June 1733 . He responded in the Daily Post on 11 June 1733 with a history of the events since he first started in 1721 until his removal . He accused the management of bad treatment and wrote : 
 I could give the Publick a great many Instances of the Gentlemen 's <unk> and of Injuries done to the Company this Season in their Direction . But when I affirm that they have no Experience , no Knowledge , no Capacity , For Gathering together , Forming , Entertaining , Governing , <unk> , and Keeping a Company of Comedians ... more than the being able to purchase the Patent [ ... ] it is a Truth that if any one does not now believe , I am positive that they will in a very little Time be thoroughly convinced of . 
 = = Contemporary response = = 
 Many of the local newspapers were quick to respond to the rebellion . An article in The Craftsman dated 2 June 1733 described the actors as " <unk> Players " who were busy in mutiny . On 7 June , the Grub @-@ Street Journal stated , in an article by Musaeus , that Theophilus was selfish . Another article in the Grub @-@ Street Journal , by Philo <unk> , attacked the management for not understanding how theatres are supposed to work . The managers were the first to state their defence and argued that everything they did was correct and that the actors had no reason to complain , especially over the treatment that they received . 
 The actors responded later in June with A Letter from Theophilus Cibber , <unk> , To John Highmore , Esq . Within the response , Theophilus Cibber emphasised the inability of the management to effectively run the theatre , claimed that they were acting like tyrants , and alleged that they unjustly refused the offer by the actors to rent out the patent . This did not calm the dispute ; instead , the Grub @-@ Street Journal of 14 June 1733 printed parts of John Vanbrugh 's Aesop , a play that criticised the actor rebellion that took place in 1695 . On 26 June , the Grub @-@ Street Journal in an article by Musaeus claimed that many of the problems that the actors complained about were caused by previous managers , who were also actors , and not by the current management that was composed of outsiders . Additionally , Musaeus claimed that actors in general were unfit to run the theatre . 
 A pamphlet titled An Impartial State of the Present Dispute Between the Patent and Players was published during the late summer that attacked the actors . It claimed that " all Men of Sense and Integrity seem to be entirely convinced that the Patentees of the Theatre @-@ Royal in Drury @-@ Lane , have had great Injustice done them by the late Attempt of Part of their own Company to defraud them of their Property " . The actors responded in an article published in the Daily Journal of 26 September . Also during the summer , Edward Phillips produced The Stage @-@ Mutineers , a play that started on 27 July and ran for twelve nights . The play made fun of actors , writers , and the management as a whole . Even though it was attacked in the Grub @-@ Street Journal of 9 August , theatre historian Robert Hume described the play as " harmless stuff " . Regardless , Fielding was personally mocked as <unk> , one of the characters within the play , and was offended by the portrayal . 
 = = Reopening = = 
 The Theatre Royal reopened on 24 September 1733 with a new company of actors . The majority of the rebellious actors joined the Little Theatre in Haymarket and started producing plays on 26 September . Although the Theatre Royal had replacement actors of a lesser talent and a few loyal experienced members , Henry Fielding joined the management 's side of the dispute . Of the 15 loyal actors that stayed with the Theatre Royal , only a few , including Kitty Clive , Christiana Horton , William <unk> , and Charles <unk> , were of note . Reportedly , Highmore was losing 50 – 60 pounds a week . Victor , in his account of the time , wrote : 
 In this maimed Condition the Business of Course went lamely on ; for a very middling Company of Players could be expected to bring but thin losing Audiences , especially while Party prevailed , and those very Plays were acted much better in the Haymarket . The unavoidable and melancholy Consequence of this Proceeding was , that there was a <unk> every Saturday Morning in the Office against the Manager , of Fifty or Sixty Pounds ; and his Pride , as well as his Honour , were too nearly concerned not to prudence the Deficiency every Week with the utmost <unk> . 
 In such conditions , Giffard sold his shares and turned over full control of the theatre to Highmore . Hill was brought in to work with the actors at Drury Lane by Autumn 1733 , but the theatre was still declining by the end of the year . 
 In order to aid the theatre , Fielding revised his The Author 's Farce and The Intriguing Chambermaid . Fielding 's The Miser was also put on 27 October 1733 with the King , the Queen , and many noble families in attendance . After this , Fielding produced The Universal Gallant : or , The Different Husbands , which didn 't run until February 1735 . 20th @-@ century theatre scholar Charles Woods believed that Fielding joined with the management of the Theatre Royal because they were " people whose legitimate investments were being jeopardized " . Fielding later attacked Theophilus in a revised version of his The Author 's Farce which ran on 15 January 1734 . This caused a backlash upon him after the rebelling actors finally won in the dispute , and it was harder for him to stage plays . 
 Theophilus , through his father , applied to the Lord Chamberlain during the summer asking to have a new license issued , but he was refused . Following this , he applied to Charles Lee , the Master of the Revels , and received a license to perform theatrical shows in return for payment even though the license had no legal authority . This brought about criticism against Lee in the Daily Post dated 29 September 1733 over issuing the licence and called it just a ploy by the actors . On 30 October , the management of the Theatre Royal sent a letter to veteran actor John Mills and other rebels threatening further legal action regarding their unlicensed theatre . After Theophilus responded with a claim that he was acting within the law , the management and John Rich , manager of the Theatre Royal , Covent Garden , demanded the courts to shut down the unlicensed theatres . A 5 November hearing set a date for a trial , but the case fell apart before it was ever heard over the technical wording of a law that conflicted with the original request by the licensed theatre managers . 
 A trial , in which the rebellious actors sued the management at the King 's Bench over the management 's occupation of the building that the actors controlled the lease , was held on 12 November . The judgment under Chief Justice Philip Yorke was in favour of the actors , and they were to be granted control of the theatre building in March 1734 . Highmore , in response , asked for a charge against John Harper , one of the rebellious actors , for being a vagrant , and Harper was sent to Bridewell Palace prison . This provoked a negative reaction by the public , and the action was attacked in the Daily Post of 16 November . Eventually , a writ of habeas corpus was issued on 20 November and he was released without a case tried against him . Having no other recourse , Highmore began to negotiate the sale of the theatre license . Charles Fleetwood purchased both Highmore and Wilks 's portions of the license on 24 January 1734 . On 2 February , the Daily Courant announced that Fleetwood asked for the rebellious actors to return . An agreement was reached for higher wages and promotion of Theophilus to a deputy manager of the theatre . The actors took control of the Theatre Royal on 8 March 1734 , marking the end of the rebellion . 
 = Kidney stone = 
 A kidney stone , also known as a renal calculus or <unk> , is a solid piece of material which is formed in the kidneys from minerals in urine . Kidney stones typically leave the body in the urine stream , and a small stone may pass without causing symptoms . If stones grow to sufficient size ( usually at least 3 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 1 in ) ) they can cause blockage of the ureter . This leads to pain , most commonly beginning in the flank or lower back and often radiating to the groin . This pain is often known as renal colic and typically comes in waves lasting 20 to 60 minutes . Other associated symptoms include : nausea , vomiting , fever , blood in the urine , pus in the urine , and painful urination . <unk> of the ureter can cause decreased kidney function and dilation of the kidney . 
 Most stones form due to a combination of genetics and environmental factors . Risk factors include being overweight , certain foods , some medications , and not drinking enough fluids . The diagnosis is usually based on symptoms , urine testing , and medical imaging . Blood tests may also be useful . Urinary stones are typically classified by their location in the kidney ( nephrolithiasis ) , ureter ( <unk> ) , or bladder ( <unk> ) , or by their chemical composition ( calcium @-@ containing , struvite , uric acid , or other compounds ) . 
 In those who have previously had stones , prevention is recommended by drinking fluids such that more than two liters of urine is produced per day . If this is not effective enough , thiazide diuretic , citrate or allopurinol may be taken . It is recommended that soft drinks containing phosphoric acid ( typically <unk> ) be avoided . When a stone causes no symptoms , no treatment is needed . For stones which are causing symptoms , pain control is usually the first measure , using medications such as nonsteroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs or opioids . More severe cases may require procedures . For example , some stones can be shattered into smaller fragments using extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy . Others require <unk> procedures . 
 In 2013 , 49 million cases of kidney stones occurred , resulting in about 15 @,@ 000 deaths globally . In the United States , about 9 % of the population has had a kidney stone . Generally , slightly more men are affected than women . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 The hallmark of a stone that obstructs the ureter or renal pelvis is excruciating , intermittent pain that radiates from the flank to the groin or to the inner thigh . This pain , known as renal colic , is often described as one of the strongest pain sensations known . Renal colic caused by kidney stones is commonly accompanied by urinary urgency , restlessness , hematuria , sweating , nausea , and vomiting . It typically comes in waves lasting 20 to 60 minutes caused by <unk> contractions of the ureter as it attempts to expel the stone . The embryological link between the urinary tract , the genital system , and the gastrointestinal tract is the basis of the radiation of pain to the gonads , as well as the nausea and vomiting that are also common in urolithiasis . <unk> <unk> and hydronephrosis can be observed following the obstruction of urine flow through one or both ureters . Pain in the lower left quadrant can sometimes be confused with diverticulitis because the sigmoid colon overlaps the ureter and the exact location of the pain may be difficult to isolate due to the close proximity of these two structures . 
 = = Risk factors = = 
 Dehydration from low fluid intake is a major factor in stone formation . 
 High dietary intake of animal protein , sodium , refined sugars , fructose and high fructose corn syrup , oxalate , grapefruit juice , and apple juice may increase the risk of kidney stone formation . 
 Kidney stones can result from an underlying metabolic condition , such as distal renal tubular acidosis , Dent 's disease , hyperparathyroidism , primary hyperoxaluria , or medullary sponge kidney . 3 – 20 % of people who form kidney stones have medullary sponge kidney . 
 Kidney stones are more common in people with Crohn 's disease ; Crohn 's disease is associated with hyperoxaluria and malabsorption of magnesium . 
 A person with recurrent kidney stones may be screened for such disorders . This is typically done with a 24 @-@ hour urine collection . The urine is analyzed for features that promote stone formation . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Calcium is one component of the most common type of human kidney stones , calcium oxalate . Some studies suggest people who take calcium or vitamin D as a dietary supplement have a higher risk of developing kidney stones . In the United States , kidney stone formation was used as an indicator of excess calcium intake by the Reference Daily Intake committee for calcium in adults . 
 In the early 1990s , a study conducted for the Women 's Health Initiative in the US found that postmenopausal women who consumed 1000 mg of supplemental calcium and 400 international units of vitamin D per day for seven years had a 17 % higher risk of developing kidney stones than subjects taking a placebo . The Nurses ' Health Study also showed an association between supplemental calcium intake and kidney stone formation . 
 Unlike supplemental calcium , high intakes of dietary calcium do not appear to cause kidney stones and may actually protect against their development . This is perhaps related to the role of calcium in binding ingested oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract . As the amount of calcium intake decreases , the amount of oxalate available for absorption into the bloodstream increases ; this oxalate is then excreted in greater amounts into the urine by the kidneys . In the urine , oxalate is a very strong promoter of calcium oxalate precipitation — about 15 times stronger than calcium . A 2004 study found that diets low in calcium are associated with a higher overall risk for kidney stone formation . For most individuals , other risk factors for kidney stones , such as high intakes of dietary oxalates and low fluid intake , play a greater role than calcium intake . 
 = = = Other electrolytes = = = 
 Calcium is not the only electrolyte that influences the formation of kidney stones . For example , by increasing urinary calcium excretion , high dietary sodium may increase the risk of stone formation . 
 Drinking fluoridated tap water may increase the risk of kidney stone formation by a similar mechanism , though further epidemiologic studies are warranted to determine whether fluoride in drinking water is associated with an increased incidence of kidney stones . High dietary intake of potassium appears to reduce the risk of stone formation because potassium promotes the urinary excretion of citrate , an inhibitor of calcium crystal formation . 
 Kidney stones are more likely to develop , and to grow larger , if a person has low dietary magnesium . Magnesium inhibits stone formation . 
 = = = Animal protein = = = 
 Diets in Western nations typically contain a large proportion of animal protein . Consumption of animal protein creates an acid load that increases urinary excretion of calcium and uric acid and reduced citrate . Urinary excretion of excess sulfurous amino acids ( e.g. , cysteine and methionine ) , uric acid , and other acidic metabolites from animal protein acidifies the urine , which promotes the formation of kidney stones . Low urinary citrate excretion is also commonly found in those with a high dietary intake of animal protein , whereas vegetarians tend to have higher levels of citrate excretion . Low urinary citrate , too , promotes stone formation . 
 = = = Vitamins = = = 
 The evidence linking vitamin C supplements with an increased rate of kidney stones is inconclusive . The excess dietary intake of vitamin C might increase the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation , in practice this is rarely encountered . The link between vitamin D intake and kidney stones is also tenuous . Excessive vitamin D supplementation may increase the risk of stone formation by increasing the intestinal absorption of calcium ; correction of a deficiency does not . 
 = = = Other = = = 
 There are no conclusive data demonstrating a cause @-@ and @-@ effect relationship between alcoholic beverage consumption and kidney stones . However , some have theorized that certain behaviors associated with frequent and binge drinking can lead to dehydration , which can in turn lead to the development of kidney stones . 
 The American <unk> Association has projected that global warming will lead to an increased incidence of kidney stones in the United States by expanding the " kidney stone belt " of the southern United States . 
 People with lymphoproliferative / myeloproliferative disorders who were treated with chemotherapy developed symptomatic kidney stones 1 @.@ 8 % of the time in one study . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 = = = Hypocitraturia = = = 
 Hypocitraturia or low urinary citrate excretion ( defined as lower than 320 mg / day ) can cause kidney stones in up to 2 / 3 of cases . The protective role of citrate is linked to several mechanisms ; in fact citrate reduces urinary supersaturation of calcium salts by forming soluble complexes with calcium ions and by inhibiting crystal growth and aggregation . The therapy with potassium citrate , or magnesium potassium citrate , is commonly prescribed in clinical practice in order to increase urinary citrate and to reduce stone formation rates . 
 = = = Supersaturation of urine = = = 
 When the urine becomes supersaturated ( when the urine solvent contains more solutes than it can hold in solution ) with one or more calculogenic ( crystal @-@ forming ) substances , a seed crystal may form through the process of nucleation . Heterogeneous nucleation ( where there is a solid surface present on which a crystal can grow ) proceeds more rapidly than homogeneous nucleation ( where a crystal must grow in a liquid medium with no such surface ) , because it requires less energy . Adhering to cells on the surface of a renal papilla , a seed crystal can grow and aggregate into an organized mass . Depending on the chemical composition of the crystal , the stone @-@ forming process may proceed more rapidly when the urine pH is unusually high or low . 
 Supersaturation of the urine with respect to a calculogenic compound is pH @-@ dependent . For example , at a pH of 7 @.@ 0 , the solubility of uric acid in urine is 158 mg / 100 ml . Reducing the pH to 5 @.@ 0 decreases the solubility of uric acid to less than 8 mg / 100 ml . The formation of uric acid stones requires a combination of hyperuricosuria ( high urine uric acid levels ) and low urine pH ; hyperuricosuria alone is not associated with uric acid stone formation if the urine pH is alkaline . Supersaturation of the urine is a necessary , but not a sufficient , condition for the development of any urinary calculus . Supersaturation is likely the underlying cause of uric acid and cystine stones , but calcium @-@ based stones ( especially calcium oxalate stones ) may have a more complex etiology . 
 = = = Inhibitors of stone formation = = = 
 Normal urine contains chelating agents , such as citrate , that inhibit the nucleation , growth , and aggregation of calcium @-@ containing crystals . Other endogenous inhibitors include calgranulin ( an S @-@ 100 calcium binding protein ) , Tamm – Horsfall protein , <unk> , <unk> ( a form of <unk> ) , <unk> ( an acidic glycoprotein ) , prothrombin F1 peptide , and <unk> ( <unk> acid @-@ rich protein ) . The biochemical mechanisms of action of these substances have not yet been thoroughly elucidated . However , when these substances fall below their normal proportions , stones can form from an aggregation of crystals . 
 Sufficient dietary intake of magnesium and citrate inhibits the formation of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones ; in addition , magnesium and citrate operate synergistically to inhibit kidney stones . Magnesium 's efficacy in subduing stone formation and growth is dose @-@ dependent . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Diagnosis of kidney stones is made on the basis of information obtained from the history , physical examination , urinalysis , and radiographic studies . Clinical diagnosis is usually made on the basis of the location and severity of the pain , which is typically colicky in nature ( comes and goes in spasmodic waves ) . Pain in the back occurs when calculi produce an obstruction in the kidney . Physical examination may reveal fever and tenderness at the <unk> angle on the affected side . 
 = = = Imaging studies = = = 
 In people with a history of stones , those who are less than 50 years of age and are presenting with the symptoms of stones without any concerning signs do not require helical CT scan imaging . 
 Otherwise a <unk> helical CT scan with 5 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 2 in ) sections is the diagnostic modality of choice in the radiographic evaluation of suspected nephrolithiasis . All stones are detectable on CT scans except very rare stones composed of certain drug residues in the urine , such as from <unk> . Calcium @-@ containing stones are relatively radiodense , and they can often be detected by a traditional radiograph of the abdomen that includes the kidneys , ureters , and bladder ( KUB film ) . Some 60 % of all renal stones are <unk> . In general , calcium phosphate stones have the greatest density , followed by calcium oxalate and magnesium ammonium phosphate stones . Cystine calculi are only faintly radiodense , while uric acid stones are usually entirely radiolucent . 
 Where a CT scan is unavailable , an intravenous <unk> may be performed to help confirm the diagnosis of urolithiasis . This involves intravenous injection of a contrast agent followed by a KUB film . <unk> present in the kidneys , ureters or bladder may be better defined by the use of this contrast agent . Stones can also be detected by a retrograde <unk> , where a similar contrast agent is injected directly into the distal ostium of the ureter ( where the ureter terminates as it enters the bladder ) . 
 Ultrasound imaging of the kidneys can sometimes be useful , as it gives details about the presence of hydronephrosis , suggesting the stone is blocking the outflow of urine . <unk> stones , which do not appear on KUB , may show up on ultrasound imaging studies . Other advantages of renal ultrasonography include its low cost and absence of radiation exposure . Ultrasound imaging is useful for detecting stones in situations where X @-@ rays or CT scans are discouraged , such as in children or pregnant women . Despite these advantages , renal ultrasonography in 2009 was not considered a substitute for <unk> helical CT scan in the initial diagnostic evaluation of urolithiasis . The main reason for this is that compared with CT , renal ultrasonography more often fails to detect small stones ( especially ureteral stones ) , as well as other serious disorders that could be causing the symptoms . A 2014 study confirmed that ultrasonography rather than CT as an initial diagnostic test results in less radiation exposure and did not find any significant complications . 
 = = = Laboratory examination = = = 
 Laboratory investigations typically carried out include : 
 microscopic examination of the urine , which may show red blood cells , bacteria , leukocytes , urinary casts and crystals ; 
 urine culture to identify any infecting organisms present in the urinary tract and sensitivity to determine the susceptibility of these organisms to specific antibiotics ; 
 complete blood count , looking for <unk> ( increased neutrophil granulocyte count ) suggestive of bacterial infection , as seen in the setting of struvite stones ; 
 renal function tests to look for abnormally high blood calcium blood levels ( hypercalcemia ) ; 
 24 hour urine collection to measure total daily urinary volume , magnesium , sodium , uric acid , calcium , citrate , oxalate and phosphate ; 
 collection of stones ( by urinating through a <unk> kidney stone collection cup or a simple tea strainer ) is useful . Chemical analysis of collected stones can establish their composition , which in turn can help to guide future preventive and therapeutic management . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 Kidney stones are typically classified by their location and chemical composition . 
 = = = = Chemical composition = = = = 
 = = = = = Calcium @-@ containing stones = = = = = 
 By far , the most common type of kidney stones worldwide contains calcium . For example , calcium @-@ containing stones represent about 80 % of all cases in the United States ; these typically contain calcium oxalate either alone or in combination with calcium phosphate in the form of apatite or <unk> . Factors that promote the precipitation of oxalate crystals in the urine , such as primary hyperoxaluria , are associated with the development of calcium oxalate stones . The formation of calcium phosphate stones is associated with conditions such as hyperparathyroidism and renal tubular acidosis . 
 <unk> is increased in patients with certain gastrointestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn disease or patients who have undergone resection of the small bowel or small bowel bypass procedures . <unk> is also increased in patients who consume increased amounts of oxalate ( found in vegetables and nuts ) . Primary hyperoxaluria is a rare autosomal recessive condition which usually presents in childhood . 
 Calcium oxalate crystals in urine appear as ' envelopes ' microscopically . They may also form ' <unk> 
 = = = = = Struvite stones = = = = = 
 About 10 – 15 % of urinary calculi are composed of struvite ( ammonium magnesium phosphate , <unk> · 6H2O ) . Struvite stones ( also known as " infection stones " , urease or triple @-@ phosphate stones ) , form most often in the presence of infection by urea @-@ splitting bacteria . Using the enzyme urease , these organisms metabolize urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide . This <unk> the urine , resulting in favorable conditions for the formation of struvite stones . Proteus mirabilis , Proteus vulgaris , and <unk> <unk> are the most common organisms isolated ; less common organisms include <unk> <unk> , and some species of Providencia , Klebsiella , Serratia , and Enterobacter . These infection stones are commonly observed in people who have factors that predispose them to urinary tract infections , such as those with spinal cord injury and other forms of neurogenic bladder , ileal conduit urinary diversion , <unk> reflux , and obstructive <unk> . They are also commonly seen in people with underlying metabolic disorders , such as idiopathic hypercalciuria , hyperparathyroidism , and gout . Infection stones can grow rapidly , forming large <unk> staghorn ( antler @-@ shaped ) calculi requiring invasive surgery such as percutaneous nephrolithotomy for definitive treatment . 
 Struvite stones ( triple phosphate / magnesium ammonium phosphate ) have a ' coffin lid ' morphology by microscopy . 
 = = = = = Uric acid stones = = = = = 
 About 5 – 10 % of all stones are formed from uric acid . People with certain metabolic abnormalities , including obesity , may produce uric acid stones . They also may form in association with conditions that cause hyperuricosuria ( an excessive amount of uric acid in the urine ) with or without hyperuricemia ( an excessive amount of uric acid in the serum ) . They may also form in association with disorders of acid / base metabolism where the urine is excessively acidic ( low pH ) , resulting in precipitation of uric acid crystals . A diagnosis of uric acid urolithiasis is supported by the presence of a radiolucent stone in the face of persistent urine acidity , in conjunction with the finding of uric acid crystals in fresh urine samples . 
 As noted above ( section on calcium oxalate stones ) , patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis ) tend to have hyperoxaluria and form oxalate stones . These patients also have a tendency to form urate stones . <unk> stones are especially common after colon resection . 
 Uric acid stones appear as pleomorphic crystals , usually diamond @-@ shaped . They may also look like squares or rods which are polarizable . 
 Patients with hyperuricosuria can be treated with allopurinol which will reduce urate formation . Urine alkalinization may also be helpful in this setting . 
 = = = = = Other types = = = = = 
 People with certain rare inborn errors of metabolism have a propensity to accumulate crystal @-@ forming substances in their urine . For example , those with <unk> , <unk> , and Fanconi syndrome may form stones composed of cystine . Cystine stone formation can be treated with urine alkalinization and dietary protein restriction . People afflicted with <unk> often produce stones composed of xanthine . People afflicted with adenine <unk> deficiency may produce 2 @,@ 8 @-@ <unk> stones , <unk> produce <unk> acid stones , and <unk> produce stones of glycine , proline and hydroxyproline . <unk> has also been noted to occur in the setting of therapeutic drug use , with crystals of drug forming within the renal tract in some people currently being treated with agents such as <unk> , sulfadiazine and <unk> . 
 = = = = Location = = = = 
 <unk> refers to stones originating anywhere in the urinary system , including the kidneys and bladder . <unk> ( from the Ancient Greek : <unk> <unk> , " kidney " ; and <unk> , lithos , " stone " ) refers to the presence of such calculi in the kidneys . <unk> calculi refers to aggregations in either the minor or major calyx , parts of the kidney that pass urine into the ureter ( the tube connecting the kidneys to the urinary bladder ) . The condition is called <unk> when a calculus is located in the ureter . Stones may also form or pass into the bladder , a condition referred to as <unk> .

 Specific therapy should be tailored to the type of stones involved . Diet can have a profound influence on the development of kidney stones . Preventive strategies include some combination of dietary modifications and medications with the goal of reducing the excretory load of calculogenic compounds on the kidneys . Current dietary recommendations to minimize the formation of kidney stones include : 
 Increasing total fluid intake to more than two liters per day of urine output . 
 Increasing citric acid intake ; lemon / lime juice is the richest natural source . 
 Moderate calcium intake 
 Limiting sodium intake 
 Avoidance of large doses of supplemental vitamin C 
 Limiting animal protein intake to no more than two meals daily ( an association between animal protein consumption and recurrence of kidney stones has been shown in men ) . 
 Limiting consumption of cola soft drinks , which contain phosphoric acid , to less than one liter of soft drink per week . 
 Maintenance of dilute urine by means of vigorous fluid therapy is beneficial in all forms of nephrolithiasis , so increasing urine volume is a key principle for the prevention of kidney stones . Fluid intake should be sufficient to maintain a urine output of at least 2 litres ( 68 US fl oz ) per day . A high fluid intake has been associated with a 40 % reduction in recurrence risk . The quality of the evidence for this , however , is not very good . 
 Calcium binds with available oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract , thereby preventing its absorption into the bloodstream , and reducing oxalate absorption decreases kidney stone risk in susceptible people . Because of this , some <unk> and urologists recommend chewing calcium tablets during meals containing oxalate foods . Calcium citrate supplements can be taken with meals if dietary calcium cannot be increased by other means . The preferred calcium supplement for people at risk of stone formation is calcium citrate because it helps to increase urinary citrate excretion . 
 Aside from vigorous oral hydration and consumption of more dietary calcium , other prevention strategies include avoidance of large doses of supplemental vitamin C and restriction of oxalate @-@ rich foods such as leaf vegetables , rhubarb , soy products and chocolate . However , no randomized , controlled trial of oxalate restriction has yet been performed to test the hypothesis that oxalate restriction reduces the incidence of stone formation . Some evidence indicates magnesium intake decreases the risk of symptomatic nephrolithiasis . 
 = = = Urine alkalinization = = = 
 The mainstay for medical management of uric acid stones is alkalinization ( increasing the pH ) of the urine . Uric acid stones are among the few types amenable to dissolution therapy , referred to as <unk> . <unk> is usually achieved through the use of oral medications , although in some cases , intravenous agents or even <unk> of certain irrigating agents directly onto the stone can be performed , using antegrade <unk> or retrograde ureteral catheters . Acetazolamide ( Diamox ) is a medication that <unk> the urine . In addition to acetazolamide or as an alternative , certain dietary supplements are available that produce a similar alkalinization of the urine . These include sodium bicarbonate , potassium citrate , magnesium citrate , and <unk> ( a combination of citric acid monohydrate and sodium citrate dihydrate ) . Aside from alkalinization of the urine , these supplements have the added advantage of increasing the urinary citrate level , which helps to reduce the aggregation of calcium oxalate stones . 
 Increasing the urine pH to around 6 @.@ 5 provides optimal conditions for dissolution of uric acid stones . Increasing the urine pH to a value higher than 7 @.@ 0 increases the risk of calcium phosphate stone formation . Testing the urine periodically with <unk> paper can help to ensure the urine pH remains in this optimal range . Using this approach , stone dissolution rate can be expected to be around 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) of stone radius per month . 
 = = = Diuretics = = = 
 One of the recognized medical therapies for prevention of stones is the thiazide and thiazide @-@ like diuretics , such as <unk> or <unk> . These drugs inhibit the formation of calcium @-@ containing stones by reducing urinary calcium excretion . Sodium restriction is necessary for clinical effect of thiazides , as sodium excess promotes calcium excretion . <unk> work best for renal leak hypercalciuria ( high urine calcium levels ) , a condition in which high urinary calcium levels are caused by a primary kidney defect . <unk> are useful for treating absorptive hypercalciuria , a condition in which high urinary calcium is a result of excess absorption from the gastrointestinal tract . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 For people with hyperuricosuria and calcium stones , allopurinol is one of the few treatments that have been shown to reduce kidney stone recurrences . <unk> interferes with the production of uric acid in the liver . The drug is also used in people with gout or hyperuricemia ( high serum uric acid levels ) . Dosage is adjusted to maintain a reduced urinary excretion of uric acid . Serum uric acid level at or below 6 mg / 100 ml ) is often a therapeutic goal . Hyperuricemia is not necessary for the formation of uric acid stones ; hyperuricosuria can occur in the presence of normal or even low serum uric acid . Some practitioners advocate adding allopurinol only in people in whom hyperuricosuria and hyperuricemia persist , despite the use of a urine @-@ <unk> agent such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate . 
 = = Management = = 
 Stone size influences the rate of spontaneous stone passage . For example , up to 98 % of small stones ( less than 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 in ) in diameter ) may pass spontaneously through urination within four weeks of the onset of symptoms , but for larger stones ( 5 to 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter ) , the rate of spontaneous passage decreases to less than 53 % . Initial stone location also influences the likelihood of spontaneous stone passage . Rates increase from 48 % for stones located in the proximal ureter to 79 % for stones located at the <unk> junction , regardless of stone size . Assuming no high @-@ grade obstruction or associated infection is found in the urinary tract , and symptoms are relatively mild , various nonsurgical measures can be used to encourage the passage of a stone . Repeat stone formers benefit from more intense management , including proper fluid intake and use of certain medications . In addition , careful surveillance is clearly required to maximize the clinical course for people who are stone formers . 
 = = = Pain management = = = 
 Management of pain often requires intravenous administration of NSAIDs or opioids . Orally administered medications are often effective for less severe discomfort . The use of <unk> do not have further benefit . 
 = = = Expulsion therapy = = = 
 The use of medications to speed the spontaneous passage of ureteral calculi is referred to as medical <unk> therapy . Several agents , including alpha adrenergic blockers ( such as tamsulosin ) and calcium channel blockers ( such as <unk> ) , have been found to be effective . Alpha blockers appear to lead to both higher and faster stone clearance rates . A combination of tamsulosin and a corticosteroid may be better than tamsulosin alone . These treatments also appear to be a useful adjunct to lithotripsy . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 <unk> shock wave lithotripsy ( ESWL ) is a noninvasive technique for the removal of kidney stones . Most ESWL is carried out when the stone is present near the renal pelvis . ESWL involves the use of a lithotriptor machine to deliver externally applied , focused , high @-@ intensity pulses of ultrasonic energy to cause fragmentation of a stone over a period of around 30 – 60 minutes . Following its introduction in the United States in February 1984 , ESWL was rapidly and widely accepted as a treatment alternative for renal and ureteral stones . It is currently used in the treatment of uncomplicated stones located in the kidney and upper ureter , provided the aggregate stone burden ( stone size and number ) is less than 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) and the anatomy of the involved kidney is normal . For a stone greater than 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) , ESWL may not help break the stone in one treatment ; instead , two or three treatments may be needed . Some 80 to 85 % of simple renal calculi can be effectively treated with ESWL . A number of factors can influence its efficacy , including chemical composition of the stone , presence of anomalous renal anatomy and the specific location of the stone within the kidney , presence of hydronephrosis , body mass index , and distance of the stone from the surface of the skin . Common adverse effects of ESWL include acute trauma , such as bruising at the site of shock administration , and damage to blood vessels of the kidney . In fact , the vast majority of people who are treated with a typical dose of shock waves using currently accepted treatment settings are likely to experience some degree of acute kidney injury . ESWL @-@ induced acute kidney injury is dose @-@ dependent ( increases with the total number of shock waves administered and with the power setting of the lithotriptor ) and can be severe , including internal bleeding and <unk> hematomas . On rare occasions , such cases may require blood transfusion and even lead to acute renal failure . <unk> rates may be related to the type of lithotriptor used ; hematoma rates of less than 1 % and up to 13 % have been reported for different lithotriptor machines . Recent studies show reduced acute tissue injury when the treatment protocol includes a brief pause following the initiation of treatment , and both improved stone breakage and a reduction in injury when ESWL is carried out at slow shock wave rate . 
 In addition to the aforementioned potential for acute kidney injury , animal studies suggest these acute injuries may progress to scar formation , resulting in loss of functional renal volume . Recent prospective studies also indicate elderly people are at increased risk of developing new @-@ onset hypertension following ESWL . In addition , a retrospective case @-@ control study published by researchers from the Mayo Clinic in 2006 has found an increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus and hypertension in people who had undergone ESWL , compared with age and gender @-@ matched people who had undergone nonsurgical treatment . Whether or not acute trauma progresses to long @-@ term effects probably depends on multiple factors that include the shock wave dose ( i.e. , the number of shock waves delivered , rate of delivery , power setting , acoustic characteristics of the particular lithotriptor , and frequency of <unk> ) , as well as certain intrinsic predisposing <unk> risk factors . 
 To address these concerns , the American <unk> Association established the Shock Wave <unk> Task Force to provide an expert opinion on the safety and risk @-@ benefit ratio of ESWL . The task force published a white paper outlining their conclusions in 2009 . They concluded the risk @-@ benefit ratio remains favorable for many people . The advantages of ESWL include its noninvasive nature , the fact that it is technically easy to treat most upper urinary tract calculi , and that , at least acutely , it is a well @-@ tolerated , low @-@ morbidity treatment for the vast majority of people . However , they recommended slowing the shock wave firing rate from 120 pulses per minute to 60 pulses per minute to reduce the risk of renal injury and increase the degree of stone fragmentation . 
 = = = Surgery = = = 
 Most stones under 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 in ) pass spontaneously . Prompt surgery may , nonetheless , be required in persons with only one working kidney , bilateral obstructing stones , a urinary tract infection and thus , it is presumed , an infected kidney , or intractable pain . Beginning in the mid @-@ 1980s , less invasive treatments such as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy , ureteroscopy , and percutaneous nephrolithotomy began to replace open surgery as the modalities of choice for the surgical management of urolithiasis . More recently , flexible ureteroscopy has been adapted to facilitate retrograde <unk> creation for percutaneous nephrolithotomy . This approach is still under investigation , though early results are favorable . <unk> nephrolithotomy or , rarely , <unk> nephrolithotomy , is the treatment of choice for large or complicated stones ( such as <unk> staghorn calculi ) or stones that cannot be extracted using less invasive procedures . 
 = = = = <unk> surgery = = = = 
 <unk> has become increasingly popular as flexible and rigid fiberoptic <unk> have become smaller . One ureteroscopic technique involves the placement of a ureteral stent ( a small tube extending from the bladder , up the ureter and into the kidney ) to provide immediate relief of an obstructed kidney . Stent placement can be useful for saving a kidney at risk for <unk> acute renal failure due to the increased hydrostatic pressure , swelling and infection ( <unk> and <unk> ) caused by an obstructing stone . <unk> stents vary in length from 24 to 30 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 to 11 @.@ 8 in ) and most have a shape commonly referred to as a " double @-@ J " or " double pigtail " , because of the curl at both ends . They are designed to allow urine to flow past an obstruction in the ureter . They may be retained in the ureter for days to weeks as infections resolve and as stones are dissolved or fragmented by ESWL or by some other treatment . The stents dilate the ureters , which can facilitate instrumentation , and they also provide a clear landmark to aid in the visualization of the ureters and any associated stones on radiographic examinations . The presence of indwelling ureteral stents may cause minimal to moderate discomfort , frequency or urgency incontinence , and infection , which in general resolves on removal . Most ureteral stents can be removed <unk> during an office visit under topical anesthesia after resolution of the urolithiasis . 
 More definitive ureteroscopic techniques for stone extraction ( rather than simply bypassing the obstruction ) include basket extraction and ultrasound <unk> . Laser lithotripsy is another technique , which involves the use of a holmium : yttrium aluminium garnet ( Ho : YAG ) laser to fragment stones in the bladder , ureters , and kidneys . 
 <unk> techniques are generally more effective than ESWL for treating stones located in the lower ureter , with success rates of 93 – 100 % using Ho : YAG laser lithotripsy . Although ESWL has been traditionally preferred by many practitioners for treating stones located in the upper ureter , more recent experience suggests ureteroscopic techniques offer distinct advantages in the treatment of upper ureteral stones . Specifically , the overall success rate is higher , fewer repeat interventions and postoperative visits are needed , and treatment costs are lower after ureteroscopic treatment when compared with ESWL . These advantages are especially apparent with stones greater than 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter . However , because ureteroscopy of the upper ureter is much more challenging than ESWL , many urologists still prefer to use ESWL as a first @-@ line treatment for stones of less than 10 mm , and ureteroscopy for those greater than 10 mm in diameter . <unk> is the preferred treatment in pregnant and morbidly obese people , as well as those with bleeding disorders . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Kidney stones affect all geographical , cultural , and racial groups . The lifetime risk is about 10 to 15 % in the developed world , but can be as high as 20 to 25 % in the Middle East . The increased risk of dehydration in hot climates , coupled with a diet 50 % lower in calcium and 250 % higher in oxalates compared to Western diets , accounts for the higher net risk in the Middle East . In the Middle East , uric acid stones are more common than calcium @-@ containing stones . The number of deaths due to kidney stones is estimated at 19 @,@ 000 per year being fairly consistent between 1990 and 2010 . 
 In North America and Europe , the annual number of new cases per year of kidney stones is roughly 0 @.@ 5 % . In the United States , the frequency in the population of urolithiasis has increased from 3 @.@ 2 % to 5 @.@ 2 % from the mid @-@ 1970s to the mid @-@ 1990s . The total cost for treating urolithiasis was US $ 2 billion in 2003 . About 65 – 80 % of those with kidney stones are men ; most stones in women are due to either metabolic defects ( such as <unk> ) or infection . ( p . 1057 ) Men most commonly experience their first episode between 30 and 40 years of age , whereas for women , the age at first presentation is somewhat later . The age of onset shows a bimodal distribution in women , with episodes peaking at 35 and 55 years . Recurrence rates are estimated at 50 % over a 10 @-@ year and 75 % over 20 @-@ year period , with some people experiencing ten or more episodes over the course of a lifetime . 
 A 2010 review concluded that rates of disease are increasing . 
 = = History = = 
 The existence of kidney stones was first recorded thousands of years ago , and lithotomy for the removal of stones is one of the earliest known surgical procedures . In 1901 , a stone discovered in the pelvis of an ancient Egyptian mummy was dated to 4 @,@ 800 BC . Medical texts from ancient Mesopotamia , India , China , Persia , Greece , and Rome all mentioned <unk> disease . Part of the Hippocratic Oath suggests there were practicing surgeons in ancient Greece to whom physicians were to defer for <unk> . The Roman medical treatise De Medicina by Aulus Cornelius Celsus contained a description of lithotomy , and this work served as the basis for this procedure until the 18th century . 
 Famous people who were kidney stone formers include Napoleon I , Epicurus , Napoleon III , Peter the Great , Louis XIV , George IV , Oliver Cromwell , Lyndon B. Johnson , Benjamin Franklin , Michel de Montaigne , Francis Bacon , Isaac Newton , Samuel Pepys , William Harvey , Herman Boerhaave , and Antonio Scarpa . 
 New techniques in lithotomy began to emerge starting in 1520 , but the operation remained risky . After Henry Jacob Bigelow popularized the technique of <unk> in 1878 , the mortality rate dropped from about 24 % to 2 @.@ 4 % . However , other treatment techniques continued to produce a high level of mortality , especially among inexperienced urologists . In 1980 , Dornier <unk> introduced extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for breaking up stones via acoustical pulses , and this technique has since come into widespread use . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 Renal calculus is from the Latin <unk> , " kidneys , " and calculus , " pebble " ) . <unk> ( stone formation ) in the kidneys is called nephrolithiasis ( / <unk> / ) , from <unk> ( kidney ) + <unk> ( stone ) + <unk> ( disorder ) . 
 = = Research directions = = 
 Crystallization of calcium oxalate appears to be inhibited by certain substances in the urine that retard the formation , growth , aggregation , and adherence of crystals to renal cells . By purifying urine using salt precipitation , isoelectric focusing , and size @-@ exclusion chromatography , some researchers have found that calgranulin , a protein formed in the kidney , is a potent inhibitor of the in vivo formation of calcium oxalate crystals . Considering its extremely high levels of inhibition of growth and aggregation of calcium oxalate crystals , calgranulin might be an important intrinsic factor in the prevention of nephrolithiasis . 
 = = Children = = 
 Although kidney stones do not often occur in children , the incidence is increasing . These stones are in the kidney in two thirds of reported cases , and in the ureter in the remaining cases . Older children are at greater risk independent of age and sex . 
 As with adults , most pediatric kidney stones are predominantly composed of calcium oxalate ; struvite and calcium phosphate stones are less common . Calcium oxalate stones in children are associated with high amounts of calcium , oxalate , and magnesium in acidic urine .

 Maryland Route 150 ( MD 150 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . Known for most of its length as either Eastern Avenue or Eastern Boulevard , the highway runs 13 @.@ 01 miles ( 20 @.@ 94 km ) from U.S. Route 40 ( US 40 ) in Baltimore east to Graces Quarters Road in Chase in eastern Baltimore County . MD 150 connects Baltimore with its southeastern suburbs of Dundalk , Essex , and Middle River . The state highway also links those communities with Interstate 95 , I @-@ 695 , I @-@ 895 , and Martin State Airport . MD 150 was constructed from Baltimore to Middle River and in Chase in the mid @-@ 1920s . The road was completed through Middle River in the early 1930s . Between 1942 and 1944 , MD 150 was reconstructed as a four @-@ lane divided highway with interchanges to improve access between Baltimore and the Glenn L. Martin Company aircraft manufacturing plant in Middle River . The highway has followed several routes since it was extended west into the city of Baltimore in the mid @-@ 1940s ; the present route in East Baltimore was established shortly after 2000 .

 MD 150 is known as Eastern Avenue from just west of I @-@ 895 in Baltimore to the Back River between Dundalk and Essex . The highway is also named Eastern Avenue from Carroll Island Road in Middle River to the highway 's eastern terminus in Chase . Between the two sections of Eastern Avenue , MD 150 follows Eastern Boulevard through Essex and Middle River . The state highway is maintained by the Baltimore City Department of Transportation in the city of Baltimore and by the Maryland State Highway Administration in Baltimore County . MD 150 is a part of the National Highway System as a rail @-@ to @-@ truck intermodal freight transport connection from its western terminus at US 40 to I @-@ 95 within Baltimore . The highway is also a National Highway System principal arterial from I @-@ 95 to Carroll Island Road in Middle River .

 MD 150 begins at an intersection with US 40 ( Pulaski Highway ) in East Baltimore . The route heads south as Haven Street , a four @-@ lane undivided street that passes through an industrial area . East of the Highlandtown neighborhood , MD 150 turns east onto Lombard Street , which crosses over three rail spurs that head south to Canton ; one line splits from CSX 's Philadelphia Subdivision , while the other two spring from the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and are operated by Norfolk Southern Railway . The state highway 's run on Lombard Street ends at Ponca Street ; Lombard Street continues east toward ramps to northbound I @-@ 895 ( Harbor Tunnel Thruway ) and Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center . MD 150 turns south onto Ponca Street , a four @-@ lane divided highway that has a ramp to southbound I @-@ 895 toward the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel . The highway follows Ponca Street to the Greektown neighborhood , where MD 150 turns east onto Eastern Avenue and immediately crosses over I @-@ 895 . 
 MD 150 continues east as a six @-@ lane divided highway that reduces to four lanes at Dundalk Avenue . The highway runs through the Joseph Lee neighborhood , where it intersects Kane Street and meets the Canton Railroad at grade before the highway 's partial cloverleaf interchange with I @-@ 95 . Access from eastbound MD 150 to southbound I @-@ 95 is provided via Kane Street to the south . Just east of I @-@ 95 , the state highway enters Baltimore County . While passing along the northern edge of Dundalk , MD 150 follows the edge of Oaklawn Cemetery and meets MD 151 ( North Point Boulevard ) at a cloverleaf interchange . The route passes along the north side of the Eastpoint Mall , crosses the Norfolk Southern rail spur to Sparrows Point , and meets I @-@ 695 ( Baltimore Beltway ) at a partial cloverleaf interchange . Access from northbound I @-@ 695 to westbound MD 150 and from eastbound MD 150 to southbound I @-@ 695 is provided through MD 151 . East of the Beltway , MD 150 passes the city of Baltimore 's Back River Waste Water Treatment Plant and crosses the Back River .

 On the east side of the Back River , MD 150 enters the densely populated community of Essex . Just east of <unk> Avenue , the highway 's old alignment , Old Eastern Avenue , splits to the east . In the center of Essex , MD 150 has a partial interchange with MD 702 ( Southeast Boulevard ) that only allows access to and from the north ; access to the southern part of the Back River Neck is provided via Old Eastern Avenue 's connection with MD 702 or the parallel <unk> Run Road . The route continues northeast and receives the other end of Old Eastern Avenue before crossing the Middle River into the community of Middle River . MD 150 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 700 ( Martin Boulevard ) at Lockheed Martin 's Middle River Complex . The highway closely parallels the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and meets the northern end of MD 587 ( Wilson Point Road ) , after which the route passes along the northern edge of Martin State Airport . MD 150 curves away from the railroad just west of the Martin State Airport station on MARC 's Penn Line and the highway 's intersection with MD 43 ( White Marsh Boulevard ) . 
 East of MD 43 and the adjacent General Services Administration facility , MD 150 becomes a five @-@ lane road with center turn lane east to Carroll Island Road . East of that county highway , which leads to the community of Bowleys Quarters , the state highway reduces to two lanes . MD 150 passes under a Norfolk Southern Railway spur from the Amtrak Northeast Corridor to the Charles P. Crane Generating Station and intersects <unk> Point Road , which leads into Dundee Natural Environment Area . The route ends at its intersection with Ebenezer Road and Graces Quarter Road in the community of Chase . Graces Quarter Road serves as a connector to the main section of the county highway , which heads east into a unit of Gunpowder Falls State Park . The county highway also heads west as Ebenezer Road , which passes over Eastern Avenue and the Amtrak Northeast Corridor immediately to the northeast on Eastern Avenue . Eastern Avenue itself continues northeast as a county highway to its end at Greenbank Road on the Gunpowder River . 
 = = History = = 
 The predecessor highway of MD 150 was an oyster shell road from the village of Highlandtown ( later annexed by Baltimore ) to Chase . Between the Back River and Middle River , this highway was operated as the east – west segment of the Back River Neck Turnpike ; the turnpike also included what is now Back River Neck Road . The first portion of Eastern Avenue improved by the Maryland State Roads Commission was from the eastern terminus in Chase to east of Earls Road , which was paved as a 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) wide concrete road around 1923 . MD 150 was constructed as a macadam road from the Baltimore city line to the crossing of Middle River in 1924 ; this section would be widened with concrete shoulders to a width of 18 to 20 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 to 6 @.@ 1 m ) by 1926 . The gap between the Middle River and east of Earls Road remained a county highway until the existing highway was supplemented by concrete shoulders and repaved in macadam between 1932 and 1934 . The portion of Eastern Avenue in the city of Baltimore was not part of MD 150 , which had its western terminus at the city – county line as of 1939 . 
 Suburban development in Dundalk and Essex and the establishment of the Glenn L. Martin Company aircraft manufacturing plant in Middle River in 1929 resulted in heavy traffic along MD 150 . By 1934 , an average of 5 @,@ 275 vehicles per day used the highway between Baltimore and Middle River , leading the Maryland State Roads Commission to recommend widening the highway to 40 feet ( 12 m ) in width . Relief did not come until just before World War II when MD 150 from Baltimore to Middle River was deemed a vital defense connection between the city and the Martin aircraft plant . MD 150 was expanded to a four @-@ lane divided highway from Dundalk Avenue in Baltimore to east of the Martin aircraft plant in Middle River between 1942 and 1944 . This expansion involved the construction of interchanges at Martin Boulevard ( later designated MD 700 ) and North Point Boulevard , a northern extension of MD 151 that was also constructed as a defense access project . Replacement bridges were built over the Back River and Middle River . MD 150 was also relocated in Essex ; Old Eastern Avenue was designated MD 600 , a designation removed by 1956 . 
 By 1946 , MD 150 had been extended west into the city of Baltimore over Eastern Avenue at least as far as Highlandtown . Around 1950 , the state highway followed Highland Avenue south from US 40 to Eastern Avenue . MD 150 was moved to Kresson Street , Lombard Street , and Ponca Street , which met Eastern Avenue just west of its present junction , in 1960 . Around 1963 , Haven Street and Kresson Street were converted to a one @-@ way pair , with Haven Street carrying eastbound traffic south and Kresson Street handling westbound traffic toward US 40 . The portion of Lombard Street between Haven and Kresson was added to MD 150 ; the state highway was also extended north on Haven and Kresson to Monument Street , then east along Monument Street to MD 150 's new western terminus at US 40 at the U.S. Highway 's underpass of CSX 's Philadelphia Subdivision . This convoluted path was ameliorated around 2002 when the highway was shortened to its present course in East Baltimore .

 Xenogears is a science fiction role @-@ playing video game developed and published by Squaresoft ( now Square Enix ) for Sony 's PlayStation . It was released on February 11 , 1998 , in Japan and on October 20 , 1998 , in North America . The game was never released in PAL territories . It was re @-@ released by Squaresoft as a Greatest Hits title in 2003 , and on the PlayStation Network on June 25 , 2008 , in Japan and on February 22 , 2011 , in North America . 
 Xenogears follows protagonist Fei Fong Wong and several others as they journey to uncover the truth behind mysterious , <unk> entities operating in their world . The principles and philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche , Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung influence the plot , character design , and world of Xenogears . Additionally , the symbols , theological concepts , and devotional practices of several world religions are represented in fictionalized forms in the game . Major psychological themes are the nature of identity and human memory , particularly as these relate to the phenomenon of dissociative identity disorder . The relationship between humanity and machines is central to the game 's plot , as indicated by the presence of giant robots dubbed " gears , " which almost each playable character can control . 
 Xenogears received critical acclaim , with a 91 % rating on Game Rankings and a score of 83 out of 100 at Metacritic . Reviews particularly praised the storyline with multiple subplots , the gameplay , the characters , the themes ( including allusions to Jungian psychology , Freudian thought , and Gnostic spirituality ) , and the generally epic scope of the narrative . It was voted the 16th best video game of all time by readers of Famitsu in 2006 . Xenogears has shipped 1 @.@ 19 million copies worldwide as of March 31 , 2003 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Xenogears combines traditional role @-@ playing video game structures such as Square 's signature Active Time Battle system with new features particular to the game 's martial @-@ arts combat style . It features two slightly different battle systems : in the first the user controls human characters in turn @-@ based combat manipulated through the sequencing of learned combos . The second , making use of " gears , " introduces different sets of statistics and abilities for each character . Xenogears features both traditional anime and pre @-@ rendered CGI movie clips by Production I.G to illustrate important plot points . 
 The player advances the protagonist and his companions through a fully three @-@ dimensional fictional world . There is an overworld map with visitable cities , geographical sites , and other important locations spread out across several continents . A couple of locations encountered throughout the game exist not on the original world map , but in the sky . At first , the party only travels on foot , but is eventually permitted to make use of a variety of vehicles , including their gears and the " sand submarine " Yggdrasil . 
 = = = Battle system = = = 
 Battle in Xenogears is a variant of the Active Time Battle system found in games such as Chrono Trigger and the Final Fantasy series . Most enemy encounters in Xenogears are random . When a battle begins , there is a transition to a separate screen with a combat interface . Player @-@ characters use a combination of martial arts moves , " Ether " ( magical ) attacks , and special " <unk> " combinations which are learned through the repetition of specific proportions of strong , moderate , and weak hits . All offensive actions use Action Points ( AP ) , costing either three points , two points , or one point , corresponding to the intensity of the attack . Each character can initially use only three AP per turn , but at higher levels , they can eventually use up to seven AP per turn . At a certain point in the game , characters can begin using " Elemental <unk> , " which , as the name implies , attach elemental attributes to physical combos . In addition to being used for attacks , AP may be saved and allocated to Attack Points for combo attacks during later turns . A total of 28 AP may be accumulated for combo attacks . 
 Characters can also use a variety of magical abilities for both offense and ally @-@ support . These abilities are limited by the number of Ether Points ( EP ) that are available to a character , which must be replenished using items during exploration ( non @-@ combat ) sequences . For most characters , these abilities are attributed to " Ether , " a mysterious power to which ( presumably ) all humans have access . Some characters ' magical abilities are referred to by different names , implying differences in their origins . For example , Fei 's magic is called " Chi " and Citan 's is called " Arcane " . While fighting in gears , human Ether abilities are amplified , though some change or become unavailable during this type of combat . 
 = = = Gear battle = = = 
 In addition to small @-@ scale , hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat , the characters sometimes fight from within their respective giant robots , called gears . In gear combat , the limiting factor of AP is replaced by fuel , with each attack consuming an amount corresponding to its power . For these battles , " deathblows " may only be executed after first building up the " Attack Level " — an abstract concept represented by a number in the bottom @-@ left of the gear combat interface — through the execution of simple strong , moderate , or weak attacks . One deathblow is allowed per point on the Attack Level gauge . There are three levels for normal gear deathblows and , beyond the third level , an " infinite " level with its own set of deathblows . To reach Infinity Mode , a character has to stay at attack level 3 while performing any other action . With each turn , there is a chance that Infinity Mode will be reached . Having a duration of three turns , " Infinity Mode " allows fuel to be recharged in much larger quantities and , while in this mode , gears have access to " Infinity " attacks . This mode is actually referred to as " Hyper Mode " in @-@ game through a little @-@ known text read @-@ out found in one of the bonus dungeons at the end of the game . 
 Gears can regain fuel with a " Charge " command . The gears can also activate " Boosters " which enable them to act faster at a cost of extra fuel per turn . The " Special Option " command allows for gear HP restoration abilities and special , fuel @-@ consuming attacks . When a gear has no fuel left , it can no longer execute attacks , use special options , or use boosters . They can , however , Charge to regain fuel and use Ether abilities . Gear fuel , parts , and upgrades may be purchased in shops or from certain individual vendors .

 Xenogears initially takes place on Ignas , the largest continent of the Xenogears world , and the site of a centuries @-@ long war between the nations of Aveh and Kislev . A church @-@ like organization known as the Ethos has excavated gears , ostensibly for the preservation of the world 's culture . Although Kislev originally had the upper hand in the war , a mysterious army known as Gebler appeared and began to provide assistance to Aveh . With Gebler 's help , the Aveh military not only recovered its losses , but began making its way into Kislev 's territory . As the story unfolds , the setting broadens to encompass the entire world and the two floating countries , Shevat and Solaris . Solaris , ruled by Emperor Cain and the Gazel Ministry , commands the Gebler army and the Ethos and secretly uses both to dominate the land @-@ dwellers . Shevat has been the only country to evade the control of Solaris . 
 Much of Xenogears plot and backstory is detailed in the Japanese @-@ only book Xenogears Perfect Works . This book , produced by the now defunct DigiCube , details the history of the Xenogears universe from the discovery of the Zohar to the start of the game . According to the Perfect Works schematic ( as well as the game 's end credits ) , Xenogears is the fifth episode in a series of six , with events spanning multiple millennia .

 Xenogears ' nine playable characters hail from different areas of the game 's world . The game begins on Ignas , a continent with two countries , Aveh and Kislev . Fei and Citan at first appear to be from this land , although it is later learned that they originate from the capital cities <unk> Aura and <unk> of the floating countries of Shevat and Solaris , respectively . Fei is the story 's protagonist , and has initially lost his memories of his past . Citan is a man whose knowledge of the world and technology often aids in the party 's quest . Bart , a desert pirate , is also from Ignas and is the rightful heir to the throne of Aveh . Rico , a demi @-@ human with incredible strength , lives in a Kislev prison , spending his days as a gear @-@ battling champion . Solaris , a hidden city of advanced technology , is home to several characters in the game . Billy , a pious worker for the Ethos religious group , was originally from Solaris . Elly , a beautiful Gebler officer of Solaris , is destined to be near Fei and falls in love with him by the end of the game . Maria and Chu @-@ Chu are both from Shevat , the floating city and the only place resisting Solaris ' domination . Emeralda is a humanoid being constructed by an ancient civilization from a colony of nanomachines , and was retrieved from the ruins of the ancient civilization Zeboim . Significant non @-@ playable characters include Krelian and Miang , both leaders of Solaris who seek to revive Deus , a mechanical weapon that fell to earth thousands of years ago . They serve as the game 's main antagonists . Grahf , a mysterious man with immense power , serves as a major antagonist ; he follows Fei and his group and often fights them , though his goals remain a mystery until very late in the game . As being the Contact , the Anti @-@ type and the Complement , Fei , Elly , and Miang have been reincarnated several times throughout the game 's history . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 Xenogears centers around the protagonist Fei Fong Wong , an adopted young male in the village , Lahan , brought by a mysterious " masked man " three years ago . The events surrounding Fei 's arrival at the village cause him to have retrograde amnesia . During an attack on Lahan from Gebler , Fei pilots an empty gear and fights the enemy , accidentally destroying the village . As a result , Fei and Citan , the village 's doctor , decide to leave with the abandoned gear to get it away from the village . Fei meets Elly , a Gebler officer , and Grahf , who claims to know about Fei 's past . Eventually , Fei and Citan are picked up by Bart , a desert pirate and heir to the throne of Aveh . Fei again loses control of himself inside his gear while Bart and Citan are attacked by an unknown red gear . Fei wakes up in a Kislev prison and meets Wiseman , a mysterious masked man , who originally brought Fei to Lahan . Fei is able to escape with the help of his friends , but he and Elly are separated from the rest of the party and accidentally shot down by Bart. 
 They are rescued by the Thames , a mobile floating city . After learning Elly 's whereabouts , Gebler attacks Thames to kidnap Elly and Miang , a Gebler officer , unsuccessfully brainwashes her . <unk> , who holds a vendetta against Fei , attacks Thames , searching for him . Afterward , Billy , an Ethos worker onboard Thames , allows Fei to use the Ethos ' advanced medical technology . Bishop Stone , Ethos ' leader , reveals to the party Ethos 's true purpose of controlling the land dwellers , or " Lambs " , for Solaris . The group follows Stone to Zeboim , an excavation site . They discover a young girl composed of nanomachines , which is what Krelian , a <unk> leader , seeks . Stone takes the girl while the group fights Id , the mysterious red gear 's pilot , who wants the girl , but is stopped by Wiseman . The group returns and finds Fei awake and standing at his gear with a case of anterograde amnesia . Fei and his friends decide to ally themselves with the floating city of Shevat , the only remaining city capable of resisting Solaris . When entering Solaris , they encounter Emeralda , the nanomachine colony . She attacks at first , but recognizes Fei , referring to him as " Kim " , much to Fei 's confusion . In Solaris , Fei learns that Citan has been working for Emperor Cain and that Solaris has been producing food and medicine out of recycled humans in the Soylent System facility . The party also learns that the Gazel Ministry seeks to revive Deus and achieve eternal life , while Krelian seeks to possess Elly . Back at Shevat , Citan informs his friends that Id is actually Fei 's split personality . 
 The Gazel Ministry uses the <unk> Key , an artifact that manipulates the DNA of massive amounts of humans around the world , turning them into mutants called Wels in order to collect flesh to reconstruct a god called Deus that crash @-@ landed on the planet ten thousand years ago . During this time , Elly and Fei become romantically involved with each other . They learn that they are the reincarnations of Sophia and Lacan . Lacan was a painter while Sophia was the Holy Mother of Nisan around the time of the war between Shevat and Solaris five @-@ hundred years earlier . Lacan blamed himself for Sophia 's death during the war and , with the help of Miang , became Grahf and sought to destroy the world . Although defeated , he and Miang have <unk> their minds into other humans since . Krelian and Miang dispose of the Emperor and the Gazel Ministry because they are no longer necessary and kidnap Elly , the Mother , who must be sacrificed in order to revive Deus . Miang is killed by an enraged <unk> as he realizes he has been used , and Elly turns into Miang , becoming absorbed by Deus . Fei , as Id , attempts to make contact with the Zohar . Wiseman , who reveals himself to be Fei 's father , stops him , giving peace to Fei 's other personalities . Fei 's gear transforms into the Xenogears and Grahf appears , revealing that he had been inside Fei 's father 's body . At this time , Fei makes contact with the Wave Existence — an extra @-@ dimensional being who is trapped inside Deus and is the source of power for all gears — and learns that he must destroy Deus to free humanity . Grahf , who tries to merge with Fei , is defeated . 
 Fei discovers that he is a descendant of Abel , a young boy who was a passenger on board the Eldridge , a spaceship that was being used to transport Deus , the core of an interplanetary invasion system created by a federation of spacefaring humans , one that was deemed far too dangerous for use and was therefore dismantled . Deus , however , had become self @-@ aware and took over the Eldridge . Amidst the confusion , Abel was separated from his mother and accidentally made contact with the Wave Existence through the Zohar , Deus ' power source . It gave him the power to one day destroy Deus and the Zohar in order to free itself . The Wave Existence also sensed Abel 's longing for his mother and used the biological computer <unk> to create a woman for a companion . When Deus gained full control over the Eldridge , the captain decided to initiate the self @-@ destruct sequence in an attempt to destroy it . Both Deus and the Zohar survived the explosion and landed on a nearby planet along with Abel , under the protection of the Wave Existence . He was the sole survivor , but was soon united with the woman that the Wave Existence had created for him as a companion , Elly . Abel and Elly , at first , led a happy life , but Deus had also created Miang , Cain , and the Gazel Ministry to begin a human civilization on the planet , one which would be under their control to one day be turned into Wels and be absorbed into Deus to recover its strength . When the now @-@ adult Abel and Elly discovered this , they openly challenged Cain and the Gazel Ministry , but lost . However , through the power of the Wave Existence , they are able to be reincarnated in later eras to combat Deus . One of these incarnations lived during an ancient technologically advanced era in Zeboim , where Abel 's incarnation went by the name Kim and created Emeralda . 
 Fei sets out to destroy Deus and free the Wave Existence and Elly . In <unk> , the party defeats Deus , but they realize that the energy released from the Wave Existence 's shift will destroy the planet . Elly , inside Deus , tries to move it away from the planet and Fei , in his Xenogears , follows to save her , but both disappear in the rift . Krelian confronts them , telling Fei he only sought to end the pain and suffering that comes with human existence by reverting everything back to when it all began , when all was one , to ascend to the realm of God . Fei rejects Krelian 's ideology with his love for Elly , but Krelian challenges Fei , telling him to prove this love that could make him independent of God , and calls forth <unk> , a gigantic serpent @-@ like incarnation of Miang . Xenogears appears and Fei uses it to defeat <unk> . Krelian releases Elly and reveals to Fei that he had planned to become one with God along with Elly . During her time with Krelian , Elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full of sadness and despair for all the atrocities he had committed . Despite everything , Elly says that Krelian truly loved people more than anyone else . Because no one will forgive his sins , he declines Fei 's offer to return and ascends to a higher plain of existence along with the Wave Existence , telling Fei and Elly that he envies them . Fei and Elly then return to their planet along with Xenogears and reunite with the rest of the party .

 Xenogears was produced by Hiromichi Tanaka , who previously worked on the SNES game Secret of Mana . The scenario of the game was written by director Tetsuya Takahashi and by Kaori Tanaka . Yasuyuki Honne served as art director , while Kunihiko Tanaka was responsible for the character designs . Tetsuo Mizuno , Tomoyuki Takechi , and Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi were executive producers for Xenogears . Koichi Mashimo , an animation director and his studio Bee Train , was in charge of the anime cut scenes . Xenogears started out as an early concept conceived by Tetsuya Takahashi and Kaori Tanaka for the Square game Final Fantasy VII . Their superior in the company deemed it " too dark and complicated for a fantasy " , but Takahashi was allowed to develop it as a separate project . The project began under the working title " Project Noah " . The main impetus for Takahashi was that he was growing frustrated with the Final Fantasy series . The initial concept was to make Xenogears a sequel to Chrono Trigger , but after multiple clashes with the company over this and unspecified practical difficulties , it was decided to make it a completely original title . Due to this initial development idea , there were concepts unsuited for a fantasy world , so a compromise was made by incorporating both fantasy and science fiction into the game 's world . 
 Development took approximately two years , and included a staff of thirty developers . Preliminary planning and creation of the backstory extended to several years before that . The word " Xeno " had been decided between staff from an early stage , with its meaning being " something strange or alien " . " Gears " was chosen from multiple suggested words . The game 's Gears were not present during early stages , with their places being filled by traditional summoned monsters . The game 's use of anime cutscenes was chosen as it was difficult to properly recreated Tanaka 's Gear artwork into 3D CGI . The game 's engine was also designed to be best suited for the 3D map displays and battle arenas . Takahashi had wanted to create the game in full 3D , but the PlayStation 's capacities meant this could not be managed , resulting in the current mesh of 2D sprites against 3D backgrounds . The themes and story were greatly influenced by the works and philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche , Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung . According to Tanaka , the reason for this correlation was simply due to a common interest with her husband . According to her , the story revolved around " where do we come from , what are we , where are we going " . There was a large portion of story and artwork that did not make it into the final game . 
 Square had announced that Xenogears may not have come out in the United States due to " sensitive religious issues " . The English translation of Xenogears was the first instance in which an English localization team worked directly with Square developers . It also was the first major project of Square translator Richard Honeywood . According to Honeywood , translating the game was a particularly difficult task due to it containing numerous scientific concepts and philosophies . He came into contact with it because its previously assigned translators quit or asked for reassignment due to its challenge . In a later interview , Honeywood stated that the biggest issue was with the multiple religious references , and the concept at the end of " killing God " , which needed to be adjusted so that it remained faithful to the original premise while stepping around some content that might offend . Honeywood unintentionally had a hand in the Japanese naming of Deus : the staff were originally going to call it Yahweh , and during his argument against it he said " <unk> @-@ o " , a Japanese phrase meaning something dangerous . Seeing it as a good pun , the staff used <unk> as the name . 
 Square Enix released Xenogears on the Japanese PlayStation Network on June 25 , 2008 and in North America on February 22 , 2011 . 
 = = = Audio = = = 
 The music in Xenogears was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda , composer of the SNES title Chrono Trigger . The Xenogears Original Soundtrack was released on two discs and published by DigiCube in Japan . The score contains 41 instrumental tracks , in addition to a choral track and two songs . According to Mitsuda , the music of Xenogears belongs to the traditional music genre . Though he first described it as stemming from " a world of [ his ] own imagining " rather than any specific country , he has also claimed a strong Irish or Celtic music influence . There are two vocal tracks included on the OST , and both are sung by Joanne Hogg . One of the tracks , " Stars of Tears " , did not appear in the final version of the game . It was originally intended to play in a cut scene at the start of the game along with the main staff credits . The scene , however , was removed for pacing issues , as it would have made the combined opening movie and introduction scenes last roughly ten minutes . The other , " Small Two of Pieces ~ Screeching Shards ~ " , was the first ending theme with sung lyrics to ever appear in a game developed by Square . 
 An arranged soundtrack of Xenogears also composed and arranged by Mitsuda was released as Creid . For Creid , he expanded on the theme from the original album of having Celtic influences in " easy @-@ to @-@ listen @-@ to " pop tracks to create an album of arranged Xenogears music with a more prominent Celtic style . The album contains a mixture of vocal and instrumental tracks , and combines Japanese and Celtic music together in its pieces . The album features five vocal tracks and five instrumental tracks . The main lyricist , Junko Kudo , wrote the lyrics to four of the five vocal tracks , while Mitsuda wrote the lyrics to the title track , which were then translated from Japanese to Gaelic for the recording . Celtic singer Joanne Hogg did not reprise her role in Creid . Instead , Tetsuko Honma sang the four tracks written by Kudo , while Eimear Quinn sang " Creid " . 
 In October 2010 , Mitsuda announced that he planned to work on Myth : The Xenogears Orchestral Album , a second arranged album of music from the game , in an orchestral style . He took suggestions from fans as to which tracks to include .

 There have been several Japanese books and comics published concerning the Xenogears franchise . Xenogears God Slaying Story , a series by Masatoshi Kusakabe , was published by Shueisha in 1998 . DigiCube published both Xenogears Perfect Works and a memorial album named Thousands of Daggers , which contains the entire script to the game in Japanese , along with screenshots . Two manga books , Xenogears Comic Anthology and Xenogears <unk> Comic , were released by Movic . Movic also released <unk> , notebooks , pins , keychains , stickers , and postcards depicting the Xenogears cast .

In Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu , Xenogears was voted the 16th best video game of all time by its readers in a poll held in 2006 . On a similar poll at GameFAQs , users of the website voted Xenogears the 32nd " Best Game Ever " in 2005 . It was placed in the same position in IGN 's " Top 100 Games - Readers Choice " feature in 2006 , and as number 28 in 2008 . 
 = = = Critical response = = = 
 Xenogears was met with critical acclaim . Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the story , characters , gameplay , graphics , and soundtrack . IGN described it as the " hands @-@ down best RPG " of the year , praising the storyline , gameplay , graphics , presentation , and soundtrack . GameSpot described it as one of Squaresoft 's best role @-@ playing games , praising the story , gameplay , and audio , but criticized the lack of graphical polish . Allgame pointed out in a positive light that the character battles are " unlike most role @-@ playing games from this company " . Retrospectively , Edge commented that although it is " considered by some to be a multimillion @-@ yen , convoluted science @-@ fiction vanity project , Xenogears nevertheless remains one of the most keenly eulogized PlayStation RPGs . " The magazine also noted that it was Takahashi 's " most challenging and pure work " and that the Xenosaga series never quite matched up to Xenogears . 
 The game 's story and characters were well received . Electronic Gaming Monthly said it is " rich in story and character development . " Game Informer and Next Generation agreed that the plot was one of the game 's highlights , the former drawing comparisons to Star Wars , Star Blazers , the Old Testament , and many other Square games , making it " a game every RPG fanatic must play . " IGN said the storyline is intricate , engrossing , " deep , complex , and once in a while even confusing , until more of the real underlying plotline is uncovered . " GameSpot said the story is " excellent " and " thought @-@ provoking " but said it can be " a little preachy at times " , but went on to say that the religious and existential themes " enhance the story and [ our ] understanding of the game 's deep characterizations " . Game Revolution described the storyline as " epic " and " fabulous " with " many twists and turns " and a large cast of characters . RPGFan said " the story is unique and probably the most complex and interesting of any RPG " , giving it a 99 % rating for the story . Retrospectively , Edge praised the plot 's scope and ambition and the protagonist as the " most complicated Freudian hero " in video games , but said it has a " flawed " script and " muddied " translation , as well as too many cut scenes , especially on the second disc , where the use of the world map is restricted for an extended period and the amount of cut scenes increases . Years after the game 's release , Jeremy Parish of Electronic Gaming Monthly called the game 's plot " one of the wackiest game plotlines ever " , but said that it " actually makes sense " if the player ignores all of the <unk> . IGN , however , stated that despite having too many cut scenes and a sometimes confusing plot , " immersion is a key factor in Xenogears and the questions you may have about the storyline are all answered at some point in the game . " Following the PSN release , RPGFan 's James Quentin Clark said Xenogears has " hands down the best single story I have seen in any video game , " giving it a 100 % rating for the story . 
 Reviewers largely praised Xenogears ' gameplay . Next Generation praised Square 's Active Time Battle gauge and said that inclusion of the AP meter and combo attacks " is not only refreshing in a turn @-@ based RPG , but gives players a higher level of interaction during battle . " IGN claimed that " the most impressive feature in combat is the ability to use massive " Gears " or mechs " , noting that Square 's attention to programming these battles is made evident by how " visually satisfying " they are . IGN praised the game 's exploration , saying that the ability to jump and climb " adds even more depth to exploration of different environments and distances Xenogears from being too straightforward of a traditional RPG " , the only complaint being that the rotating camera is sometimes " clumsy " . 
 The soundtrack was well received . Electronic Gaming Monthly said the game sounds as " beautiful " as it looks . GameSpot said it " expertly uses audio to push the story along " and noted that many of the games ' tracks " include voice or chanting and all are appropriately uppity or low with the game 's mood " , but said there were many areas with silence or ambience making the " game 's soundtrack a tad sparse . " Xenogears was the first Square game to feature voice overs and anime cut scenes . Electronic Gaming Monthly said they are " some of the slickest animation cinemas " they have seen . Game Revolution praised the " absolutely spectacular and stunning " hand @-@ drawn anime cut @-@ scenes , but stated that they were sparse and poorly synched with the voice acting .

 Shortly after Xenogears was released , there was speculation of a sequel being released , although this never occurred . In 1999 , Tanaka said that a project related to Xenogears was being developed . He also revealed that a sequel to Xenogears was initially planned , but never came to be . While Xenogears has never had an official sequel or prequel , there was wide speculation that Namco and Monolith Soft 's Xenosaga was a prequel when it was first announced . Tetsuya Takahashi was the director and writer for both Xenogears and Xenosaga and has noted that " with our relation between Square , I think it is difficult for us to say it is a direct sequel or prequel " . Approximately twenty members of the Xenosaga development staff had previously worked on Xenogears . 
 On the connection between Xenogears and Xenosaga , Takahashi has stated : 
 It 's probably more suitable to say that it follows the direction and style of Xenogears . [ ... ] Now that we are under a different company , we figured we should start everything from scratch all over again . Though there are familiar faces that serve as important characters in Xenosaga , others are more like self @-@ parodies , so we don 't really want Xenogears fans to overreact . Like movies , sometimes you have the director of the movie or friend of the leading actor appearing as cameos , so it 's similar to that . 
 Several members of the Xenogears staff came together in 2008 to work on Sands of Destruction , a role @-@ playing game for the Nintendo DS , published by Sega . These staff members include Masato Kato , Kunihiko Tanaka , and Yasunori Mitsuda .
