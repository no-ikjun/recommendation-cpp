 The album was recorded at the Athens <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , lit . Music Hall ) , chosen for its excellent acoustics . For the recording , Vangelis expanded the original composition of 1993 by adding two movements , extending two more and inserting some new cues throughout . The chorus parts were also touched upon , with lyrics and melodic changes . 
 Except for Vangelis , none of the performers of the 1993 concert reprised their roles . Instead , Vangelis was accompanied by the London Metropolitan Orchestra augmented with two harpists , sopranos Kathleen Battle and Jessye Norman ( both Sony Classical artists as well ) , and the Greek National Opera Choir and percussion ensemble . Vangelis asked musician Blake Neely to make the instrument transcriptions and conduct the orchestra as well . 
 Although the album was finished by the date of the concert in June 2001 , its release was held back until October . A promotional CD @-@ audio was nevertheless given to the press at the date of the concert and a CD @-@ audio in a blue velvet box was given to guests of a private dinner that took place after the concert . In 2004 , two of these boxes were auctioned off online for charity purposes , fetching a total of US $ 2 @,@ 435 .

 The album was officially released in the audio CD format only , on October 23 , 2001 to coincide with the entry of the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft in the orbit of Mars , but copies were already on sale by September in some markets . Two CD @-@ singles were also released , both featuring a track called " Mythodea Special Edit " ( 3 : 57 ) which combined parts of " Movement 9 " and " Movement 1 " , plus either " Movement 1 " or " Movement 7 " . They were not widely available , so their original purpose may have been purely promotional , as were specifically a number of other CD @-@ single releases . 
 There were variations on the track listing : some releases of the album carried alternative titles " Movement 1 " through " Movement 11 " , and " Mythodea Special Edit " was sometimes included either as a bonus or as a hidden track .

 = Toxin @-@ antitoxin system = 
 A toxin @-@ antitoxin system is a set of two or more closely linked genes that together encode both a protein ' poison ' and a corresponding ' antidote ' . When these systems are contained on plasmids – transferable genetic elements – they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division . If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell , the unstable anti @-@ toxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell ; this is known as ' post @-@ <unk> killing ' ( PSK ) . Toxin @-@ antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes , and organisms often have them in multiple copies . 
 Toxin @-@ antitoxin systems are typically classified according to how the antitoxin neutralises the toxin . In a type I toxin @-@ antitoxin system , the translation of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) that encodes the toxin is inhibited by the binding of a small non @-@ coding RNA antitoxin to the mRNA . The protein toxin in a type II system is inhibited post @-@ translationally by the binding of another protein antitoxin . A single example of a type III toxin @-@ antitoxin system has been described whereby a protein toxin is bound directly by an RNA molecule . Toxin @-@ antitoxin genes are often transferred through horizontal gene transfer and are associated with pathogenic bacteria , having been found on plasmids conferring antibiotic resistance and virulence . 
 Chromosomal toxin @-@ antitoxin systems also exist , some of which perform cell functions such as responding to stresses , causing cell cycle arrest and bringing about programmed cell death . In evolutionary terms , toxin @-@ antitoxin systems can be considered selfish DNA in that the purpose of the systems are to replicate , regardless of whether they benefit the host organism or not . Some have proposed adaptive theories to explain the evolution of toxin @-@ antitoxin systems ; for example , chromosomal toxin @-@ antitoxin systems could have evolved to prevent the inheritance of large deletions of the host genome . Toxin @-@ antitoxin systems have several biotechnological applications , such as a method of maintaining plasmids in cell lines , targets for antibiotics , and as positive selection vectors . 
 = = Evolutionary advantage = = 
 Plasmid stabilising toxin @-@ antitoxin systems have been used as examples of selfish DNA as part of the gene centered view of evolution . It has been theorised that toxin @-@ antitoxin loci serve only to maintain their own DNA , at the expense of the host organism . Other theories propose the systems have evolved to increase the fitness of plasmids in competition with other plasmids . Thus , the toxin @-@ antitoxin system confers an advantage to the host DNA by eliminating competing plasmids in cell progeny . This theory was corroborated through computer modelling . This does not , however , explain the presence of toxin @-@ antitoxin systems on chromosomes . 
 Chromosomal toxin @-@ antitoxin systems have a number of adaptive theories explaining their success at natural selection . The simplest explanation of their existence on chromosomes is that they prevent harmful large deletions of the cell 's genome , though arguably deletions of large coding regions are fatal to a daughter cell regardless . MazEF , a toxin @-@ antitoxin locus found in E. coli and other bacteria , induces programmed cell death in response to starvation , specifically a lack of amino acids . This releases the cell 's contents for absorption by neighbouring cells , potentially preventing the death of close relatives , and thereby increasing the inclusive fitness of the cell that perished . This is an example of altruism and how bacterial colonies resemble multicellular organisms . 
 Another theory states that chromosomal toxin @-@ antitoxin systems are designed to be bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal . <unk> , for example , is a global inhibitor of translation during nutrient stress , and its expression reduces the chance of starvation by lowering the cell 's nutrient requirements . A homologue of <unk> toxin called <unk> @-@ mx is essential for fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus . When nutrients become limiting in this swarming bacteria , a group of 50 @,@ 000 cells converge into a fruiting body structure . The <unk> @-@ mx toxin is a component of this nutrient @-@ stress pathway ; it enables a percentage of cells within the fruiting body to form myxospores . It has been suggested that M. xanthus has hijacked the toxin @-@ antitoxin system , replacing the antitoxin with its own molecular control to regulate its development . 
 It has also been proposed that chromosomal copies of plasmid toxin @-@ antitoxin systems may serve as anti @-@ addiction modules – a method of omitting a plasmid from progeny without suffering the effects of the toxin . An example of this is an antitoxin on the Erwinia <unk> genome that counteracts the toxic activity of an F plasmid toxin counterpart . 
 Nine possible functions of toxin @-@ antitoxin systems have been proposed . These are : 
 Junk – they have been acquired from plasmids and retained due to their addictive nature . 
 Stabilisation of genomic parasites – chromosomal remnants from transposons and bacteriophages . 
 Selfish alleles – non @-@ addictive alleles are unable to replace addictive alleles during recombination but the opposite is able to occur . 
 Gene regulation – some toxins act as a means of general repression of gene expression while others are more specific . 
 Growth control – bacteriostatic toxins , as mentioned above , restrict growth rather than killing the host cell . 
 <unk> – some bacterial populations contain a sub @-@ population of ' <unk> ' controlled by toxin @-@ antitoxin systems that are slow @-@ growing , hardy individuals , which potentially insure the population against catastrophic loss . 
 Programmed cell arrest and the preservation of the commons – the altruistic explanation as demonstrated by MazEF , detailed above . 
 Programmed cell death – similar to the above function , although individuals must have variable stress survival level to prevent entire population destruction . 
 <unk> mechanism – when bacteriophage interrupt the host cell 's transcription and translation , a toxin @-@ antitoxin system may be activated that limits the phage 's replication . 
 An experiment where five TA systems were deleted from a strain of E. coli found no evidence that the TA systems conferred an advantage to the host . This result casts doubt on the growth control and programmed cell death hypotheses . 
 = = System types = = 
 = = = Type I = = = 
 Type I toxin @-@ antitoxin systems rely on the base @-@ pairing of complementary antitoxin RNA with the toxin 's mRNA . Translation of the mRNA is then inhibited either by degradation via RNase III or by occluding the Shine @-@ Dalgarno sequence or ribosome binding site . Often the toxin and antitoxin are encoded on opposite strands of DNA . The 5 ' or 3 ' overlapping region between the two genes is the area involved in complementary base @-@ pairing , usually with between 19 – 23 contiguous base pairs . 
 Toxins of type I systems are small , hydrophobic proteins that confer toxicity by damaging cell membranes . Few intracellular targets of type I toxins have been identified , possibly due to the difficult nature of analysing proteins that are poisonous to their bacterial hosts . 
 Type I systems sometimes include a third component . In the case of the well @-@ characterised hok / sok system , in addition to the hok toxin and sok antitoxin , there is a third gene , called mok . This open reading frame almost entirely overlaps that of the toxin , and the translation of the toxin is dependent on the translation of this third component . Thus the binding of antitoxin to toxin is sometimes a simplification , and the antitoxin in fact binds a third RNA , which then affects toxin translation . 
 = = = = Example systems = = = = 
 = = = Type II = = = 
 Type II toxin @-@ antitoxin systems are generally better @-@ understood than type I. In this system a labile protein antitoxin tightly binds and inhibits the activity of a stable toxin . The largest family of type II toxin @-@ antitoxin systems is <unk> , which has been found through bioinformatics searches to represent between 37 and 42 % of all predicted type II loci . 
 Type II systems are organised in operons with the antitoxin protein typically being located upstream of the toxin . The antitoxin inhibits the toxin by downregulating its expression . The proteins are typically around 100 amino acids in length , and exhibit toxicity in a number of ways : CcdB protein , for example , affects DNA <unk> by poisoning DNA topoisomerase II whereas MazF protein is a toxic <unk> that cleaves cellular mRNAs at specific sequence motifs . The most common toxic activity is the protein acting as an endonuclease , also known as an <unk> . 
 A third protein can sometimes be involved in type II toxin @-@ antitoxin systems . In the case of the aforementioned MazEF addiction module , in addition to the toxin and antitoxin there is a regulatory protein involved called MazG . MazG protein interacts with E. coli 's Era GTPase and is described as a ' nucleoside triphosphate <unk> , ' which hydrolyses nucleoside triphosphates to monophosphates . Later research showed that MazG is transcribed in the same <unk> mRNA as <unk> and MazF , and that MazG bound the MazF toxin to further inhibit its activity . 
 = = = = Example systems = = = = 
 = = = Type III = = = 
 Type III toxin @-@ antitoxin systems rely on direct interaction between a toxic protein and an RNA antitoxin . The toxic effects of the protein are neutralised by the RNA gene . One example is the ToxIN system from the bacterial plant pathogen Erwinia <unk> . The toxic ToxN protein is approximately 170 amino acids long and has been shown to be toxic to E. coli . The toxic activity of ToxN is inhibited by <unk> RNA , an RNA with 5 @.@ 5 direct repeats of a 36 nucleotide motif ( <unk> ) . <unk> analysis of ToxIN has found that ToxN inhibition requires the formation of a trimeric ToxIN complex , whereby three <unk> monomers bind three ToxN monomers ; the complex is held together by extensive protein @-@ RNA interactions . 
 = = <unk> applications = = 
 The biotechnological applications of toxin @-@ antitoxin systems have begun to be realised by several biotechnology organisations . A primary usage is in maintaining plasmids in a large bacterial cell culture . In an experiment examining the effectiveness of the hok / sok locus , it was found that <unk> stability of an inserted plasmid expressing beta @-@ <unk> was increased by between 8 and 22 times compared to a control culture lacking a toxin @-@ antitoxin system . In large @-@ scale microorganism processes such as fermentation , progeny cells lacking the plasmid insert often have a higher fitness than those who inherit the plasmid and can outcompete the desirable microorganisms . A toxin @-@ antitoxin system maintains the plasmid thereby maintaining the efficiency of the industrial process . 
 Additionally , toxin @-@ antitoxin systems may be a future target for antibiotics . Inducing suicide modules against pathogens could help combat the growing problem of multi @-@ drug resistance . 
 Ensuring a plasmid accepts an insert is a common problem of DNA cloning . Toxin @-@ antitoxin systems can be used to positively select for only those cells that have taken up a plasmid containing the inserted gene of interest , screening out those that lack the inserted gene . An example of this application comes from CcdB @-@ encoded toxin , which has been incorporated into plasmid vectors . The gene of interest is then targeted to recombine into the CcdB locus , inactivating the transcription of the toxic protein . Thus , cells containing the plasmid but not the insert perish due to the toxic effects of CcdB protein , and only those that incorporate the insert survive . 
 Another example application involves both the CcdB toxin and <unk> antitoxin . CcdB is found in recombinant bacterial genomes and an inactivated version of <unk> is inserted into a <unk> plasmid vector . A short extra sequence is added to the gene of interest that activates the antitoxin when the insertion occurs . This method ensures orientation @-@ specific gene insertion . 
 Genetically modified organisms must be contained in a pre @-@ defined area during research . Toxin @-@ antitoxin systems can cause cell suicide in certain conditions , such as a lack of a lab @-@ specific growth medium they would not encounter outside of the controlled laboratory set @-@ up . 
 = Australian green tree frog = 
 The Australian green tree frog , simply green tree frog in Australia , White 's tree frog , or dumpy tree frog ( Litoria caerulea ) is a species of tree frog native to Australia and New Guinea , with introduced populations in the United States and New Zealand , though the latter is believed to have died out . The species belongs to the genus Litoria . It is morphologically similar to some other members of the genus , particularly the magnificent tree frog ( L. <unk> ) and the white @-@ lipped tree frog ( L. <unk> ) . 
 Larger than most Australian frogs , the Australian green tree frog reaches 10 cm ( 4 in ) or more in length . Its average lifespan in captivity , about 16 years , is long compared with most frogs . Docile and well suited to living near human dwellings , Australian green tree frogs are often found on window sills or inside houses , eating insects drawn by the light . The green tree frog screams when it is in danger to scare off its foe , and squeaks when it is touched . 
 Due to its appearance and behavioral traits , the green tree frog is a popular exotic pet throughout the world . The skin secretions of the frog have antibacterial and antiviral properties that may prove useful in pharmaceutical preparations and which have rendered it relatively immune to the population declines being experienced by many species of amphibian . It is a common species and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being " least concern " . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Australian green tree frog is a member of the New World tree frog family Hylidae and is placed in the subfamily " <unk> " which is endemic to Australia and New Guinea and includes about 160 species in the genera Cyclorana , Litoria and <unk> . Frogs in the genus Litoria are distinguishable from other tree frogs by the presence of horizontal irises and the lack of pigmentation on the eyelids . The common name of the species , " White 's tree frog " , is in honor of John White 's first description in 1790 . The green tree frog was the first Australian frog to be scientifically described ; the original specimen found its way into the collection of Sir Joseph Banks , but was destroyed when the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London was bombed in World War II . 
 The species was originally called the " blue frog " ( Rana caerulea ) despite its green color . The specimens White sent to England were damaged by the preservative and appeared blue . The color of the frog is caused by blue and green pigments covered in a yellow layer ; the preservative destroyed the yellow layer and left the frog with a blue appearance . The specific epithet , caerulea , which is Latin for blue , has remained . This frog is sometimes referred to as <unk> caerulea in the scientific literature . In Australia , the frog is also known more simply as the " green tree frog " , but that name is often given to the most common green arboreal species in a region , such as the American green tree frog ( Hyla cinerea ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The green tree frog is a plump , rather large tree frog , and can grow up to 11 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 5 in ) in length , with fully @-@ grown females being slightly larger than males . There is a distinctive fatty ridge over the eye and the parotoid gland is moderately large . The iris is golden and has a horizontal slit pupil , as is typical of the Litoria genus , and the tympanum ( a skin membrane similar to an eardrum ) is visible just behind the eye . The limbs are short and robust and there are large adhesive discs at the end of the digits which provide grip while climbing . The fingers are about one @-@ third webbed , and the toes nearly three @-@ quarters webbed . The dorsal color depends on the temperature and nature of the environment , ranging from <unk> or greyish @-@ green to bright emerald green . The frog occasionally has small , irregularly @-@ shaped white spots on its back . Males have a greyish , wrinkled vocal sac under the throat while the throat of females is white . The ventral surface in both sexes is creamy @-@ white and rough in texture . 
 This frog is similar in appearance to the magnificent tree frog ( L. <unk> ) , which inhabits only north @-@ western Australia . Older members of that species have very large parotoid glands , which cover the entire top of their heads and droop over their tympana . The parotoid gland of the green tree frog is much smaller , and it also lacks the yellow speckling on the back and the yellow markings on the hand , groin and thigh . It can be distinguished from the giant tree frog ( L. <unk> ) by the distinct white stripe that that species has along the edge of the lower jaw and extending to the shoulder , which is not present in the green tree frog . 
 The tadpoles ' appearance changes throughout their development . When newly hatched , they are 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 3 in ) long and when fully developed , 44 mm ( 1 @.@ 7 in ) . They are initially mottled with brown , and increase in pigmentation ( to either green or brown ) during development . Their underside is initially dark but later becomes lighter in hue . The eggs are brown and are wrapped in a clear jelly ; they are 1 @.@ 1 to 1 @.@ 4 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 043 to 0 @.@ 055 in ) in diameter . 
 The call is a low , slow brawk @-@ brawk @-@ brawk , repeated many times . For most of the year , the frogs call from high positions , such as trees and gutters , but during the breeding season they descend to near the ponds and pools where they will breed . Like many frogs , green tree frogs call not only to attract a mate , but also to advertise their location outside the mating season . They are particularly vocal after rain , but the reasons for this are unclear . They emit a stress call when they are in danger , such as when being attacked by a predator or when a person steps on the log in which one is concealed . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The green tree frog is native to northern and eastern regions of Australia and to the lowlands of New Guinea . Distribution is limited mostly to areas with warm , wet tropical climates . Its range spans from Irian Jaya to Port Moresby , and is most abundant on Daru Island . The International Conservation Union ( IUCN ) suggests " scattered locations " in both New Guinea and Indonesia . In Australia its range extends from the Kimberley region of Western Australia through the Northern Territory and Queensland to north and central New South Wales and the extreme northeasterly part of South Australia . Its total extent of land occupancy is approximately 4 @,@ 078 @,@ 600 square kilometres ( 1 @,@ 574 @,@ 800 sq mi ) . 
 The species has been introduced to both the United States and New Zealand . In the United States , it is restricted to two regions within Florida , where it was possibly introduced through the pet trade . Only small populations have been found there and it is unknown whether they have caused any ecological damage as an invasive species . In New Zealand , a number of individuals were liberated in various locations in 1897 and 1899 , and a further accidental introduction was made in the 1940s . No sightings have been reported of this species since the 1950s . 
 Depending on their location , green tree frogs occupy various habitats , but are not usually found in tropical rainforests . They are often found in the canopy of trees near water bodies but also occupy terrestrial habitats well away from water . They favor old stands of Eucalyptus where the trees have hollows in which water collects . They are common along inland waterways and can survive in swamps ( among the reeds ) or in grasslands in cooler climates . 
 Green tree frogs are little troubled by the presence of man and often live in close association with humans . They sometimes stray inside houses and are found in such places as sinks and toilets . They can also be found on outside windowsills at night , eating insects attracted to the light , and they may gather under outdoor lighting for the same reason . They sometimes occupy tanks ( cisterns ) , downpipes ( downspouts ) , and gutters , as these have high humidity and are usually cooler than the external environment . They may be drawn to the downpipes and tanks during the mating season because the fixtures amplify their calls . Green tree frogs seem to have homing abilities , being able to return to locations from which they were caught from a considerable distance after being displaced . 
 = = Ecology and behavior = = 
 Green tree frogs are very docile and unafraid of humans . They are nocturnal and come out in early evenings to call ( in spring and summer ) and hunt for food . During the day , they find cool , dark and moist areas , such as tree holes or rock crevices , in which to sleep . They are not a rainforest species but make use of the rain that falls almost daily and collects on leaves and in crevices , to keep themselves moist . Their skin exudes a waxy coating that helps prevent evaporation . In dry periods , they avoid desiccation by concealing themselves in a cool spot , perhaps by burrowing , and enveloping themselves in a cocoon made of shed skin and mucus . 
 The diet of the green tree frog consists mainly of insects such as moths , cockroaches and locusts . They also eat spiders and can include smaller frogs and even small mammals ( including bats ) among their prey . Frog teeth are not suited to cutting up prey , so the food item must be small enough to fit inside its mouth . Many frogs flick out their sticky tongues at prey and the victim sticks to the tip and is drawn back into the mouth and consumed . A green tree frog will use this technique for smaller prey ; for larger items however , it pounces , then pushes the prey into its mouth with its hands . 
 The frog has a few native predators , among them snakes and birds . Since the European settlement of Australia , non @-@ native predators have been introduced , primarily dogs and cats . The species has an average life expectancy in captivity of 16 years , but some have been known to live for over 20 years . 
 = = Reproduction = = 
 Breeding occurs between November and February . During the mating season , the males call from slightly elevated positions close to the still @-@ water sources in which they choose to breed . Clumps of between two hundred and two thousand eggs are laid which initially float , but sink within twenty @-@ four hours . The development of the tadpoles takes about six weeks , after which they undergo metamorphosis and leave the water as juvenile frogs . 
 = = Domestication = = 
 The green tree frog is one of the most popular pet frogs throughout the world . Its docile nature and long life expectancy make it an attractive choice for exotic @-@ pet owners . It is also one of the easier frogs to maintain : its diet is broad and it has a strong resistance to disease . One problem commonly associated with keeping this species as a pet is overfeeding ; green tree frogs tend to become obese if overfed . In the wild , exertion of energy is required for a frog to capture its prey . However , in captivity , they are usually given live feed in a confined space . This lessens the activity needed for feeding , resulting in weight gain . An overweight member of the species will deposit fat layers over the top of the head and body , giving it a " dumpy " appearance . Thus the name , " dumpy tree frog " . 
 Fireflies , genus Photinus , are poisonous to lizards , and there has been an incident when a firefly was fed to a green tree frog which subsequently died . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Australian law gives protected status to the green tree frog — along with all Australian fauna — under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 . The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the green tree frog 's conservation status as being of " least concern " , given its broad range , its large total population and its tolerance of a variety of habitat types . The population trend seems to be stable , and any decline in numbers is not likely to be at a fast enough rate to justify listing it in a more threatened category . 
 In suburban areas , this frog is threatened by pollution and by predation by domestic animals . Also , some of the frogs have been found to be infected with the chytrid fungus which causes the fatal amphibian disease chytridiomycosis . The frog 's status in New Guinea is poorly studied , but in 2002 , some 75 @,@ 000 individuals were exported from Indonesia as part of the pet trade and this may impact populations in some locations . The frog is present in a number of protected areas in New Guinea and it has been successfully bred in some Australian zoos . Overall the main threat to this species is the potential for a widespread disease epidemic . 
 = = Use in research = = 
 Although frogs have lungs , they absorb oxygen through their skin ; and for this to occur efficiently , the skin must be moist . A disadvantage of moist skin is that pathogens such as molds and bacteria can thrive on it , increasing the chance of infection . To counteract this , frogs secrete peptides that destroy these pathogens . The secretion from the paratoid gland of the green tree frog contains twenty @-@ five <unk> , a group of peptides with antibacterial and antiviral properties . It has been found that the <unk> produced by frogs of this species from different geographical localities have subtle but reproducible differences . The secretions also contain <unk> , which have the same physiological effects as <unk> @-@ 8 , a digestive hormone and hunger suppressant . These <unk> now have a number of clinical applications . Several peptides from the skin secretions of the green tree frog have been found to destroy HIV without harming healthy T cells . 
 The fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , the causal agent of chytridiomycosis , is causing declines in many species of amphibian , but it has been shown that the secretions produced by the green tree frog and certain other Australian species of frog ( Litoria <unk> and Litoria <unk> ) are protective against this fungus . The peptides inhibit the growth of the fungus in vitro and these frog species are believed not to be in decline . 
 Green tree frogs are sometimes used as model animals in research . The structure of their toepads was used to investigate the microstructure and properties of the epithelium that allows the animals to adhere to wet surfaces . 
 = Atlantic Ocean Road = 
 The Atlantic Ocean Road or the Atlantic Road ( Norwegian : <unk> ) is an 8 @.@ 3 @-@ kilometer ( 5 @.@ 2 mi ) long section of County Road 64 that runs through an archipelago in Eide and Averøy in Møre og Romsdal , Norway . It passes by <unk> , an unsheltered part of the Norwegian Sea , connecting the island of Averøy with the mainland and <unk> peninsula . It runs between the villages of <unk> on Averøy and <unk> in <unk> . It is built on several small islands and skerries , which are connected by several causeways , viaducts and eight bridges — the most prominent being <unk> Bridge . 
 The route was originally proposed as a railway line in the early 20th century , but this was abandoned . Serious planning of the road started in the 1970s , and construction started on 1 August 1983 . During construction the area was hit by 12 European windstorms . The road was opened on 7 July 1989 , having cost 122 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) , of which 25 percent was financed with tolls and the rest from public grants . Collection of tolls was scheduled to run for 15 years , but by June 1999 the road was paid off and the toll removed . The road is preserved as a cultural heritage site and is classified as a National Tourist Route . It is a popular site to film automotive commercials , has been declared the world 's best road trip , and been awarded the title as " Norwegian Construction of the Century " . In 2009 , the Atlantic Ocean Tunnel opened from Averøy to Kristiansund ; together they form a second fixed link between Kristiansund and Molde .

 The road is a 8 @.@ 274 @-@ kilometer ( 5 @.@ 141 mi ) long section of County Road 64 that connects the island and municipality of Averøy with the mainland at Eide . The road runs across an archipelago of partially inhabited islands and skerries . To the north lies <unk> , an unsheltered section of the Norwegian Sea , to the south <unk> . The road has a width of 6 @.@ 5 meters ( 21 ft ) and a maximum gradient of eight percent . It consists of eight bridges and four resting places and viewpoints . Several tourist sites , including dining , fishing and scuba diving resorts , have been established on the islands . Along with the section from <unk> to Bud , the road has been designated one of 18 National Tourist Routes . 
 The road begins at <unk> on Averøy , close to the village of <unk> .

It then runs across <unk> and <unk> , before reaching <unk> , where there are a resting place , parking and a viewpoint . Next is <unk> Bridge , a cantilever bridge 260 meters ( 850 ft ) long . The municipal boundary between Eide and Averøy runs under the bridge . It then runs across <unk> , where there is a viewpoint , before crossing onto <unk> via the three <unk> Bridges , which combined are 293 @-@ meter ( 961 ft ) long . From there the road runs through <unk> and <unk> , both with a resting place . The route reaches the mainland over the 119 @-@ meter ( 390 ft ) long <unk> Bridge .

 The first proposals to use the route were made in the early 20th century . Planning of the Rauma Line to connect the national railway network to Møre og Romsdal was under way , and several proposals were made to extend it to the coastal towns . In 1921 , Møre og Romsdal County Council chose the outer route , which would have followed a path close to that of the road . The Rauma Line was not built beyond Åndalsnes , and in 1935 the Parliament of Norway decided to connect the coastal towns in Møre og Romsdal to Åndalsnes by road instead of rail . 
 Although the plans were officially shelved , locals continued to work with the idea of a road connecting Averøy with the mainland . The toll company <unk> AS was established in 1970 . Arne <unk> , who was Minister of Local Government and Regional Development in the early 1980s , proposed that job creation funds could be allocated to road projects . The proposal was approved in 1983 , after it had been supported by the municipalities of Averøy , Eide and Fræna . Construction started as a municipal road project on 1 August 1983 , but progressed slowly . From 1 July 1986 , the Norwegian Public Roads Administration took over the project , speeding up construction and allowing it to open on 7 July 1989 . During construction , the area was hit by 12 hurricanes . The opening of the road allowed the <unk> – <unk> Ferry to be terminated . 
 Construction cost NOK 122 million and was financed 25 percent by debt to be recollected through tolls , 25 percent by job creation funds and 50 percent by ordinary state road grants . There was significant local opposition against toll financing , as few people believed it would be possible to pay off the road in the stipulated 15 years . However , by June 1999 the road was paid off and tolls removed . The accelerated amortization was caused both by greater than predicted local traffic and by large amounts of tourist traffic . 
 In 2009 , the road was Norway 's ninth @-@ most @-@ visited natural tourist attraction , with 258 @,@ 654 visitors from May through August . The route won the title " Norwegian Construction of the Century " , awarded by the Norwegian construction industry in 2005 . In 2006 , The Guardian declared it the world 's best road trip . The road has become a popular place for the automotive industry to film advertisements ; more than ten manufacturers have made television commercials along the route , often depicting the harsh weather . The Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage preserved the road as a cultural heritage in December 2009 . The Atlantic Ocean Tunnel between Averøy and Kristiansund opened on 19 December 2009 . In combination with the road it provides a fixed link between Kristiansund and Molde . This is the second fixed link between the two towns , after the 1992 opening of the Kristiansund and Frei Fixed Link .

 = George E. Smith ( gambler ) = 
 George Elsworth Smith ( 1862 – 1905 ) was an American gambler and Thoroughbred horse racing enthusiast who became a multi @-@ millionaire during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century . Smith was given the nickname " Pittsburgh Phil " in 1885 by Chicago gambler William " Silver Bill " Riley to differentiate him from the other Smiths that also frequented Riley 's pool halls . Pittsburgh Phil is considered by many <unk> to have been an expert strategist , winning large sums of money at a time when racing statistic publications , such as The Daily Racing Form , were not widely available . At the time of his death from tuberculosis in 1905 , he had amassed a fortune worth $ 3 @,@ 250 @,@ 000 , which is comparable to $ US 85 @,@ 595 @,@ 370 today . His racing Maxims , published posthumously in 1908 , are considered to be the foundations of many modern handicapping strategies and formulas . 
 = = Early life and initial occupation = = 
 = = = Family = = = 
 George Elsworth Smith was born in Sewickley , Pennsylvania in 1862 to Elizabeth ( " Eliza " ) and Christian Smith . The Smith family also included two sisters , Annie and Elizabeth , and another son , William C. Smith , that was a few years younger than George Smith . His mother was originally from Ireland and emigrated to the United States in 1857 , and his father was a carpenter from Baden , Germany . Eliza remarried after Christian Smith 's death in the early 1870s to retail grocer Edward Downing , who died in the 1880s . She remarried a second time on November 20 , 1906 to real estate and coal developer Thomas S. Wood after George Smith 's death . 
 George Smith 's sister Anne married and had a son named James Christian McGill ( 1880 – 1972 ) . McGill was orphaned at a young age when his parents died in the mid @-@ 1880s during an unspecified epidemic and was subsequently raised , along with his infant sister Eleanor , by Mrs. Smith and George Smith . Smith was a notoriously reticent and shy individual that only granted one interview during his lifetime , in which he relayed only information pertaining to racing matters . Consequently , much of the published biographical information on Pittsburgh Phil 's early life , his rise to fame and the reasoning behind his methods on the track comes from interviews with his nephew , James McGill , who was a close confidant in the ten years preceding George Smith 's death . 
 = = = Cork cutting and early sporting exploits = = = 
 The Smith family initially lived on a small farm in Sewickley , Pennsylvania but moved in 1872 to Allegheny City when George Smith was 10 years old . The Smiths eventually settled in the neighborhood of Pleasant Valley , which was located across the Ohio River from Pittsburgh in the present day city neighborhood of California @-@ Kirkbride . George Smith 's father died within a year ( in late 1872 or 1873 ) , which created financial hardships for his mother and sisters and resulted in George going to work at the age of 12 at the local cork cutting factory ( possibly Armstrong Cork Co . ) for $ 5 per week . Smith was not happy with this occupation , once remarking on the banality of the profession later in life : " [ I ] thought [ I ] could do a little better than cutting corks , inasmuch as [ I ] knew how to divide six by two . " Smith set aside money from his weekly pay ( after giving the majority to his mother ) to purchase and train <unk> , hiding the fowl from his devout Roman Catholic mother and sisters who greatly disapproved of gambling . He also bet on the outcomes of National League baseball games in Pittsburgh pool halls and would attribute his often sizable winnings to pay raises at the cork factory . 
 Most of the pool halls in 1870s Pittsburgh also broadcast horse races via telegraph . The often colorful race descriptions soon captured young Smith 's attention and he wrote down and stockpiled the names and times of the winning horses for a year to form crude racing charts . In the fall of 1879 , Smith placed his first bet on a 5 : 1 odds horse named Gabriel running in a race at the Brighton Beach racetrack at Coney Island . He won $ 38 when the horse won by 2 lengths but did not show any outward signs of emotion while the race was run . Determined that he could win at horse racing , Smith quit his job at the cork factory and accrued more than $ 5 @,@ 000 from betting on horse races in the next two years , hiding the proceeds under his mattress at home . Upon his mother eventually discovering the money , he reasoned with her that he was not really gambling because he was making logical predictions based on the past performances of horses and not merely guessing . By 1885 , Smith had become one of the most touted gamblers in Pittsburgh and had won over $ 100 @,@ 000 without ever seeing a horse race run firsthand . However , Smith was becoming too famous in Pittsburgh . He could not maintain the favorable , high odds when placing bets that he had attained earlier in his career when he was a virtual unknown because everyone in the crowd would lower the odds by betting his choices .

 = = = A new name = = = 
 The first horse race that Smith witnessed live was the 1885 Kentucky Derby in which Joe Cotton was the favorite and won at 4 : 5 odds , but he did not bet on the outcome . Smith decided that the best gambling prospects at the time were in Chicago and made his way to William " Silver Bill " Riley 's poolroom in late 1885 . Riley was a Civil War veteran from Brooklyn with prematurely gray hair that owned one of the first clubs in Chicago dedicated to betting on horse racing . It was Riley that saddled Smith with the nickname " Pittsburgh Phil " on their first meeting to differentiate George Smith 's bets from the rest of the " room full of Smiths . " Riley usually named his customers based on their appearances , but by McGill 's reckoning he chose the name " Pittsburgh Phil " because Smith was from Pittsburgh and Phil was short for Philadelphia . Smith quickly gained a reputation as being one of the most successful " <unk> " , or men that bet large sums of money on races , in Chicago . Within a few years , he relocated to New York and focused most of his betting operations out of New York tracks . 
 = = = King Cadmus and Parvenu = = = 
 Smith also purchased and raced Thoroughbred horses under the name Pleasant Valley Stable . His racing colors during the early 1890s were royal @-@ purple and canary yellow . Smith 's brother , Bill , became his principal horse trainer during the 1890s and early 1900s . One of his most successful horses was a two @-@ year @-@ old bay colt named King Cadmus . Smith purchased King Cadmus as a yearling in 1890 for $ 4 @,@ 000 at the stable dispersal sale of the late August Belmont . The colt was a son of Kingfisher and was a full brother to another popular racehorse named King Crab . The horse only won two races in his entire racing career , but Smith won $ 195 @,@ 000 from Cadmus ' two victories . The first win occurred on September 3 , 1891 at Sheepshead Bay Race Track and resulted in Smith winning approximately $ 115 @,@ 000 , which was the largest payout from a horse race recorded in the US at that time . Cadmus ' other win occurred at Morris Park Racetrack in 1892 with Smith netting another $ 80 @,@ 000 . King Cadmus was a fast runner but he had a vicious temperament , seriously injuring several of Smith 's employees , in addition to weak legs and was sold as a three @-@ year @-@ old in 1892 . 
 Parvenu ( sired by Uncas , out of <unk> ) was purchased by Smith in 1891 as a two @-@ year @-@ old and was initially considered to be a poor racing prospect by the general public due to his repeated losses early in the season . However , Smith saw potential in the colt and recognized that he could win a large amount of money if the horse could win a race against high odds . On August 29 , 1892 , Parvenu was entered in a race at Sheepshead Bay and was given 30 : 1 initial odds by bookmakers , which would have won Smith close to $ 300 @,@ 000 . However all bets had to be rescinded before the start of the race because there was a miscalculation of the horse handicapping weights , causing the odds on Parvenu to drop to 10 : 1 in the new pool . As a result , Smith only won $ 50 @,@ 000 . But despite this mishap , Smith was rewarded when the horse won nine consecutive races , netting approximately $ 200 @,@ 000 before Parvenu was retired at age four due to a spinal injury . 
 = = = Professional relationship with Tod Sloan = = = 
 Smith employed several jockeys on a race @-@ to @-@ race basis during his career as a Thoroughbred owner , including Henry " Skeets " Martin , Fred <unk> , Edward R. Garrison and Sam Doggett . However , Smith considered Tod Sloan to be the best jockey in his employ and commissioned the rider to race in only his colors from 1895 to 1897 . Smith met Sloan in the fall of 1895 at a San Francisco racetrack after Sloan had been suspended for ten days for trying to " beat the barrier " , or disregarding the starting barrier that had recently been adopted at US tracks . Smith was taken with Sloan 's unique riding style , later termed the " monkey crouch " , that redistributed the rider 's weight over the neck and withers and allowed horses to run faster . However , Smith did not trust the bookmakers at the California tracks and suspected them , as well as the trainers , of rampant cheating and paying off jockeys to not win on certain horses . Consequently , Smith paid Sloan $ 500 for every race he won , insuring that his jockey would always be trying to win on any of Smith 's mounts . Sloan returned to New York with Smith in 1896 where he became one of the top jockeys on the east coast , giving Smith the most profitable years of his career . 
 Smith soon tired of Sloan 's off @-@ track antics , which included lavish parties and often arrogant statements that questioned Smith 's judgment on the track . A case in point was Sloan 's behavior prior to the running of 1897 Brooklyn Handicap which occurred over a sloppy , mud @-@ laden track that year . Sloan had won several races on Belmar , a gray 5 @-@ year old by Belvidere , and felt confident that the horse would win the Brooklyn Handicap , openly criticizing Smith 's choice of Howard Mann in front of his other employees . However , Smith knew that Belmar was not a fast runner in the mud and that Sloan would not push the horse to win because he disliked being splattered with mud . Smith instead put Skeets Martin , who was better at racing on sloppy tracks , on the 4 @-@ year old Howard Mann . He advised Martin to , " Use your own judgment with this horse , and don 't bother about Belmar . Tod probably won 't be anywhere near you after the first hundred yards . " Howard Mann won easily , winning $ 50 @,@ 000 for Smith , while Belmar finished in 8th place . When James R. Keene asked Smith in late 1897 for permission to take Sloan to England to race in the Cambridgeshire Handicap , Smith accepted the offer . Sloan achieved great success while racing in England , but he lost his racing license permanently in 1900 . Sloan and Smith remained friends after dissolving their partnership , the later loaning Sloan $ 5 @,@ 000 without interest after his license was revoked . After Sloan 's departure , Smith used Skeets Martin as his principal jockey , but in 1899 Martin also left the US for better racing prospects in England . Willie Shaw was ultimately hired to replace Sloan and raced for Smith from 1899 until 1903 . 
 = = = Suspension = = = 
 Smith kept few horses in 1902 and consequently allowed James R. Keene to employ Willie Shaw for much of the season . While his overall percentage of wins was still high , Shaw lost some races in a way that the general public thought was suspicious and he was accused of not trying to win . Shaw 's poor performance was soon linked to some action on Smith 's part and he was accused of paying the jockey to lose , a claim which Smith vehemently denied . In May 1903 , Shaw was suspended by The Jockey Club for presumed " listless " riding on Illyria at a May 6 race at the Jamaica Racetrack . On June 24 , 1903 , Smith was also banned from entering his horses in races overseen by The Jockey Club . He admitted to no wrongdoing , and he suspected the ban was a hold @-@ over from Willie Shaw 's suspension and resulted from The Jockey Club 's increased efforts to remove <unk> from their tracks . Smith continued to make bets , notably securing $ 60 @,@ 000 when <unk> won the 1903 Suburban Handicap , but had sold his stable to <unk> <unk> by the end of the year . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Smith lived in moderation compared to other horsemen of the era , with the only outward display of ostentation being a diamond ring that he would wear to track engagements . Smith also did not smoke and only drank an occasional glass of wine . He socialized with very few women and was considered to be a confirmed bachelor by his family . He was adamant about not bringing women to racetracks , even his own mother , including a reference to their distracting influence on men in his Maxims . 
 " A man who wishes to be successful cannot divide his attentions between horses and women . A man who accepts the responsibility of escorting a woman to the race track , and of seeing that she is comfortably placed and agreeably entertained , cannot keep his mind on his work before him ... A sensible woman understands this and cannot feel hurt at my words . " 
 However , Smith did court Daisy Dixon , an aspiring actress and chorus girl from Chicago , in 1896 . The courtship turned sour after he caught her cavorting with his jockey and notorious ladies man Tod Sloan . Dixon later married fellow gambler , Riley <unk> , who eventually died broke in Rawhide , Nevada in 1908 . According to McGill , Smith never had an interest in another woman after Dixon 's betrayal . 
 = = Methods = = 
 Smith took notice of every detail in horse racing . He kept detailed notes of which horses were good runners during muddy conditions and always inspected horses at the end of a race to look for subtle signs of lameness or impediments ( i.e. loose girth straps ) that may have negatively impacted a horse 's speed . As he became more famous and seemingly successful , bookmakers would often refuse to place his bets outright for fear of losing money when he won . As a result , Smith conducted most of his betting through " beards " , or men that he would commission to place bets for him . Smith tried to keep the identity of his beards a secret and never revealed their identities , even to his other commissioners . His movements were continuously followed by agents for the bookmakers and by the Pinkerton detectives employed by The Jockey Club . 
 " They wanted to know everything I did and was going to do . That never made me mad because it was business on their part just as it was business for me to mislead the spies . I rarely have been able to keep the same set of betting commissioners for any length of time . A few bets and my commissioners were pointed out and watched . " 
 Smith rarely wrote down his bets and relied on his memory to serve him when he won and had to collect his money from the numerous commissioners that placed his bets with the bookmakers . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 By the fall of 1903 , Smith began curtailing his turf activities for frequent trips to the Adirondacks and Hot Springs to rest . His family assumed that his " nerves " were affected from the stress of his and Shaw 's suspension from racing , but Smith had also developed a persistent cough by the early months of 1904 . He made his last bet , 4 : 1 on High Chancellor , at the Sheepshead Bay racetrack during the summer of 1904 and won $ 2 @,@ 000 . 
 In October 1904 , Smith traveled to the Winyah Sanitarium in Asheville , North Carolina for treatment of his worsening cough , a result of advanced tuberculosis . George E. Smith died at the sanitarium on February 1 , 1905 . His death was attributed to " shattering of his nerves " , instead of tuberculosis , due to his habit of never showing emotion . Smith was interred in Union Dale Cemetery in Pittsburgh , a short distance from his childhood home in Allegheny . His funeral occurred on February 5 during a snowstorm and was attended by many people . He was entombed in a stone mausoleum that reportedly cost $ 30 @,@ 000 to build and was built to Smith 's specifications seven years before his death . His mother later commissioned a statue in his likeness and placed it on top of the mausoleum . The statue depicts Smith , hatless and wearing a suit , looking toward Pittsburgh while clutching a racing form . 
 Smith 's net worth , including real estate and stocks and bonds , was $ 3 @,@ 250 @,@ 000 , and as he had no will his estate was divided equally among his mother , brother , nephew ( James McGill ) and niece ( Eleanor Ewing ) . William Smith and James McGill later moved to Indianapolis in 1913 after purchasing the Indianapolis Baseball Club for $ 150 @,@ 000 . George Smith , the 1916 Kentucky Derby winner , was named after Pittsburgh Phil because he had once owned the colt 's dam , Consuelo II . His racing Maxims , gleaned from his only interview with Edward Cole a few years before his death , are still considered valid by modern <unk> .

 = Ship 's chronometer from HMS Beagle = 
 A nautical chronometer made by Thomas Earnshaw ( 1749 – 1828 ) , and once part of the equipment of HMS Beagle , the ship that carried Charles Darwin on his voyage around the world , is held in the British Museum . The chronometer was the subject of one episode of the BBC 's series A History of the World in 100 Objects . 
 Meticulous naval inventories show that HMS Beagle carried a total of at least 34 recorded chronometers on its three main survey voyages from 1826 to 1843 , and 22 on the second voyage with Darwin on board , when they had a dedicated cabin . Some were Navy property and others were on loan from the manufacturers , as well as six on the second voyage owned by the captain , Robert FitzRoy . Both the two known survivors from the second voyage are owned by the British Museum . The second is on loan to the National Museum of Australia in Canberra . 
 = = Background = = 
 Nautical chronometers were of great importance in the 18th and 19th centuries as aids to navigation . Accurate measurement of time was needed for the determination of longitude . Earnshaw was not the first to make such chronometers , but he was one of the first to make them cheaply enough that they started to become essential equipment for a ship at sea . By the time the Beagle set sail it was being reported in The Nautical Magazine that the price of chronometers was dropping rapidly while the same quality was being maintained . <unk> ' chronometer had a novel escapement mechanism , the spring detent escapement , and a bimetallic strip for temperature compensation so that it would continue to maintain accuracy in all climates around the world . 
 = = = Beagle 's <unk> = = = 
 The Beagle was sent in 1831 on a survey mission which involved circumnavigating the globe , a journey described by the naturalist on board the ship , Charles Darwin , in his book The Voyage of the Beagle and which lasted until 1836 . It was on this journey that Darwin began to form the ideas published much later as On the Origin of Species . The Beagle carried twenty @-@ two chronometers , an unusually large number , but necessary to ensure accuracy of the survey . Three would have been commonplace on ships of the time , as this is the minimum number required to easily identify one that has gone faulty . The Admiralty started a general issue of chronometers to H. M. Ships from 1825 , but between about 1800 and 1840 the availability of chronometers could not keep up with the demand . The Admiralty therefore only issued one chronometer to each ship unless the Captain personally owned one . In those cases the Admiralty would issue a second machine to make the total up to three , reasoning that a ship with two was no better off than with one since in the event of a discrepancy it was not possible to identify the faulty instrument . 
 The Beagle however , would be gone for several years and was required to take chronometers ashore and in boat expeditions up rivers to determine the coordinates of specific reference points as instructed by the Admiralty . It could not be guaranteed that any one chronometer would continue to function accurately , or even survive the journey at all . Each chronometer is mounted on gimbals to keep it level in all sea conditions and the whole assembly fixed inside a hinged wooden box for protection . For additional protection , they were stored in sawdust in a special cabin in the Captain 's quarters . Only crew who needed to take measurements , or who maintained them , were allowed access , measures which indicate the importance attached to these instruments . The Beagle voyage succeeded , for the first time , in establishing a linked chain of reference points around the globe of known longitude which could be used by subsequent voyages to calibrate their own chronometers . 
 = = = Maintenance and accuracy = = = 
 The chronometers were maintained by an instrument maker , one George James Stebbing , whose salary was paid for personally by the captain of the vessel , Robert FitzRoy . FitzRoy considered the post to be essential to the mission but the Admiralty had refused to pay for it . FitzRoy bore the cost himself , as he did for much of the ship 's equipment , but the Admiralty did concede that Stebbing could be fed from the ship 's rations . This concession was not extended to Darwin , who paid £ 500 for his own keep . 
 Fitzroy was able to measure the overall accuracy of his entire journey by using his chronometers to measure the time of local noon when he returned to his home port . As he sailed west , local noon occurred progressively later , until finally , when he had circumnavigated the globe , the shift in local noon time , as measured by his chronometers should be exactly twenty @-@ four hours . In fact , Fitzroy 's measurements exceeded this by 33 seconds , which is equivalent to just 8 @.@ 25 nautical miles ( 15 @.@ 28 km ) . This was impressive for a journey of tens of thousands of miles over five years , but nevertheless Fitzroy considered the error to be inexplicably large .

 Thomas Earnshaw 's Marine <unk> <unk> was manufactured around 1800 and served on a number of Royal Navy ships . William Edward Parry while exploring Baffin Bay in July 1819 during his first attempt to find the Northwest Passage mentions that Earnshaw 's chronometer had been used in 1818 to determine the longitude of a spot to within 1 ' 30 " of his own measurement . He does not , however , say which ship it was on board . At this early time , all Royal Navy purchased chronometers were issued by the Greenwich Observatory who also checked their rates and sent them out for cleaning between voyages . Initially , Greenwich issued chronometers directly to ships , but later , as chronometers became more common , they were sent from Greenwich to other Royal Navy ports and dockyards for issue locally . The first recorded issue from Greenwich was 3 July 1823 to Captain Frederick Marryat in command of HMS Larne . Larne took part in the First Anglo @-@ Burmese War which lasted from 1824 to 1826 . 
 The chronometer was returned to Greenwich 6 February 1826 and then sent to its makers for servicing . It did not come back to Greenwich for nearly two years . On 4 March 1828 it was issued to Captain J. Bolder in command of HMS Hecla . At this time Hecla was a famous ship : under the command of George Francis Lyon she had been part of Parry 's second expedition to find the Northwest Passage . Over 6 @,@ 000 members of the public visited the ship at Deptford while she waited to set out on Parry 's third expedition in 1824 . The attempt was abandoned in 1825 after the leading ship , HMS Fury was abandoned due to ice damage . Parry used Hecla again in an 1827 attempt to reach the North Pole . Parry unwillingly gave up Hecla when the admiralty sent her to survey the West African coast under the command of Bolder . In July 1830 the chronometer was returned from Hecla and went for cleaning to Robert Molyneux in London . It was returned to Greenwich in November but not immediately issued to another ship .

 In March 1831 the chronometer was delivered to Devonport where the rate was checked and recorded . On 6 December 1831 it was issued to Captain Stokes in command of HMS Beagle . It sailed with Captain Fitzroy in command on Beagle 's famous second voyage and was returned to Greenwich 7 November 1836 . After a period at Arnold and Dent for cleaning it was transported by HMS Lightning to Devonport or Portsmouth for issue to ships there . 
 It was returned to Greenwich 17 November 1841 and after another service by Arnold and Dent was issued to HMS Formidable on 13 January 1842 . It stayed with Formidable until 20 November 1845 when it was returned to Greenwich . It was then serviced by Charles Frodsham and sent for issue to ships at Portsmouth . It was transported back to Greenwich periodically by Royal Navy ships for service by Frodsham ( HMS Rattlesnake 11 March 1850 , HMS Odin 27 December 1854 ) and finally returned from Portsmouth 7 May 1857 . The final ship to be issued the chronometer was HMS Pembroke who received it 20 April 1858 . Pembroke returned the chronometer to Greenwich 1 February 1867 .

 After serving on Pembroke the chronometer stayed with Frodsham for over six months . Greenwich issued it to the Meteorological Committee of the Royal Society on 25 November 1867 .

Poole returned the chronometer on 13 December 1886 declaring it to be beyond economic repair . It was given to E. Dent & Co. on 16 July 1888 in part exchange for the chronometer Dent <unk> . It was later acquired by the private collector Courtenay Adrian Ilbert . After his death in 1956 , Ilbert 's collection was put up for auction in 1958 . The auction was cancelled , however , and the collection purchased by the British Museum following a private donation of funds .

 = 1940 Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania = 
 The Soviet Union issued an ultimatum to Lithuania before midnight of June 14 , 1940 . The Soviets , using a formal pretext , demanded to allow an unspecified number of Soviet soldiers to enter the Lithuanian territory and to form a new pro @-@ Soviet government ( later known as the " People 's Government " ) . The ultimatum and subsequent incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union stemmed from the division of Eastern Europe into the German and Russian spheres of influence in the Molotov – Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 . Lithuania , along with Latvia and Estonia , fell into the Russian sphere . According to the Soviet – Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty of October 1939 , Lithuania agreed to allow some 20 @,@ 000 of Soviets troops to be stationed at several bases within Lithuania in exchange for a portion of the Vilnius Region . Further Soviet actions to establish its dominance in its sphere of influence were delayed by the Winter War with Finland and resumed in spring 1940 when Germany was making rapid advances in western Europe . Despite the threat to the independence , Lithuanian authorities did little to plan for contingencies and were unprepared for the ultimatum . 
 With Soviet troops already stationed in the country according to the Mutual Assistance Treaty , it was impossible to mount effective military resistance . On June 15 , Lithuania unconditionally accepted the ultimatum and lost its independence . The Soviets sought to show the world that this was not a military occupation and annexation , but a legitimate socialist revolution , initiated by the local population demanding to join the Soviet Union . Therefore , the Soviets followed semi @-@ legal procedures : they took control of the government institutions , installed a new puppet government , and carried out show elections to the People 's Seimas . During its first session , the Seimas proclaimed creation of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and petitioned to be admitted into the Soviet Union . The petition was officially accepted by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on August 3 , 1940 . At the same time almost identical processes took place in Latvia and Estonia . Lithuania would not regain its independence until the proclamation of the Act of the Re @-@ Establishment of the State of Lithuania on March 11 , 1990 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Baltic states of Lithuania , Latvia , and Estonia were part of the Russian Empire during the 19th century , achieving independence in the aftermath of World War I. The rise of Nazi Germany during the 1930s created Russian fears of a German invasion . The Soviet Union signed the Molotov – Ribbentrop Pact with Germany in August 1939 , in part as an attempt to delay this possibility . Germany shortly initiated World War II by invading Poland on September 1 . The secret protocols of the pact , which were reinforced by the German – Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty of September 28 , divided large portions of northeastern Europe between the two powers , and assigned Lithuania to the Soviet sphere of influence . A Lithuanian delegation was invited to Moscow , where it signed the Soviet – Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty on October 10 , 1939 . According to the treaty , the Soviet Union would cede a portion of the Vilnius Region , including the important city of Vilnius , which it had gained during the invasion of Poland , to Lithuania in exchange for the right to station up to 20 @,@ 000 ( the original bargaining point was 50 @,@ 000 ) Soviet troops in Lithuania on a permanent basis . Official Soviet sources claimed that the presence of the Soviet military was necessary to strengthen defenses of a weak nation against possible attacks by Nazi Germany . In reality , it was the first step toward the eventual occupation of Lithuania and was described by The New York Times as a " virtual sacrifice of independence . " 
 Despite the pacts , the Soviet Union 's fears continued . In a stance long held by Russian military theorists , control of the Baltic Sea was crucial to the defense of St. Petersburg , Russia 's second @-@ largest city and the Baltic states offered a buffer zone between Russia and Germany . Pursuing this strategy , the Soviet Union initiated the Winter War in Finland after that country rejected a similar Moscow @-@ offered mutual assistance treaty . Stalin was unnerved by German successes in Europe , since they had taken Denmark , Norway , the Netherlands , Belgium , and Luxembourg by spring of 1940 . According to Nikita Khrushchev , after the fall of France in May , Joseph Stalin expressed the concern that Adolf Hitler would ' beat our brains in ' . 
 The political situation in Lithuania , however , remained stable between October 1939 and March 1940 . The Soviets did not interfere with Lithuania 's domestic affairs and the Russian soldiers were well @-@ behaved in their bases . As late as March 29 , 1940 , Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov delivered a speech before the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union expressing his satisfaction with the execution of the mutual assistance treaties with Lithuania , Latvia , and Estonia . While Lithuanian politicians publicly praised the Soviet Union for its generosity and touted the " traditional Soviet – Lithuanian friendship " , in private they understood this treaty was a serious threat to Lithuanian independence . The popular attitude was reflected in the slogan " Vilnius – mūsų , Lietuva – <unk> " ( Vilnius is ours , but Lithuania is Russia 's ) . 
 The Lithuanian government had been debating its options and discussing the possibility of occupation since November 1939 . At that time , the Lithuanian envoys Stasys Lozoraitis , Petras Klimas , and Bronius Kazys <unk> prepared a memorandum containing contingency plans . They advised strengthening the army , depositing funds abroad , reinforcing the 1934 Baltic Entente alliance with Latvia and Estonia , and investigating the establishment of a government @-@ in @-@ exile . Although various resolutions were forwarded , nothing tangible was accomplished . During winter 1940 the Baltic Entente nations discussed greater cooperation . Mindful of their circumstances , the three governments worded their communications carefully , but the talks would be used as evidence that Lithuania was conspiring with Latvia and Estonia in violation of the mutual assistance treaty . 
 = = Rising tension = = 
 = = = Initial accusations = = = 
 Tensions between the Soviet Union and Lithuania escalated along with Germany 's successes . By mid @-@ March 1940 , the Winter War with Finland was over and the Soviets could concentrate their attention on gaining control of the Baltic states . In April , after Germany occupied Denmark , a Lithuanian envoy in Moscow reported rising hostility from Russian diplomats . During May , while the Battle of France was in full swing , the Soviets intensified their rhetoric and diplomatic pressure . On May 16 , shortly after the German invasion of Luxembourg , Belgium , and the Netherlands , Soviet official newspaper Izvestia published an article warning that it was naive for a small country to attempt neutrality while giants were fighting for survival . Between May 18 and May 25 , Russian soldiers moved some military equipment from Vilnius to <unk> , a location much closer to the government seat in Kaunas . The action 's proximity to the then @-@ capital carried symbolic weight . 
 On May 25 , the day before the Dunkirk evacuation , Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov presented a diplomatic note that accused the Lithuanian government of abducting three Soviet soldiers stationed in Lithuania in accordance with the terms of the mutual assistance treaty . The note alleged that two soldiers had been tortured to obtain Russian military secrets but managed to escape , and that the third , <unk> , was murdered . Earlier in May , <unk> had deserted his unit and was searched by the Lithuanian police . When found , he committed suicide . The Lithuanian government replied that the accusations were baseless , but promised a full investigation of the incident and convened a special commission . However , the commission 's requests for detailed information , including interviews , photographs , physical descriptions , or other data that could further the investigation , went unanswered . The official Soviet stance was that Lithuania needed to carry out the investigation on its own and that its requests were an attempt to shift responsibility to the Russians . 
 = = = Direct negotiations = = = 
 On May 30 , the accusations were restated , in an official communique , published by TASS , the official Soviet news agency . The same day , Stasys Lozoraitis — the Lithuanian envoy in Rome — was authorized to form a government in exile in case of the Soviet occupation . The Lithuanian police tightened security around Soviet bases and arrested 272 suspicious individuals , but that only drew additional criticism of harassment . Foreign Minister Juozas Urbšys offered to settle the matter in direct negotiations in Moscow . Molotov agreed to talk but only with Prime Minister Antanas Merkys . On June 7 , Merkys arrived in Moscow . The Soviets repeated the accusations of kidnapping . Other charges were leveled , including the allegation that Minister of the Interior Kazys Skučas and Director of State Security Department Augustinas Povilaitis had provoked Russian soldiers . During the second meeting on June 9 , Molotov also accused the Lithuanian government of conspiring with Latvia and Estonia to establish a secret military union ( in reference to the Baltic Entente ) , thereby violating the mutual assistance pact . 
 On June 10 , the Lithuanian government discussed the new developments . It decided that Merkys should return to Kaunas and Urbšys should deliver a note offering withdrawal from the Baltic Entente , a full investigation of the incident , and dismissal of Skučas and Povilaitis . A personal letter from President Antanas Smetona to Chairman of Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Mikhail Kalinin repeated assurances that Lithuania always honored the mutual assistance pact . The third and final meeting between Merkys , Urbšys , and Molotov on June 11 brought no resolution . The Soviets continued to press charges which the Lithuanians could not meaningfully answer and made no more actionable requests . On June 12 , Merkys returned to Lithuania and informed the government of the situation . It was decided that Skučas should resign and Povilaitis would be immediately dismissed . The Lithuanian Army was ordered to be alert , but no orders were issued regarding mobilization or preparedness . Lithuanian politicians did not fully understand the gravity of the situation and did not think the results would be catastrophic . Urbšys reported that the Soviets strongly disapproved of Merkys and his cabinet ; he suggested that a new government be installed , possibly led by Stasys Raštikis , former Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Lithuanian Army . Such suggestion interfered with Lithuania 's domestic affairs . 
 = = = Internal crisis = = = 
 While Merkys and Urbšys negotiated in Moscow , the Lithuanian opposition saw an opportunity to unseat the authoritarian regime of Smetona and his Lithuanian National Union . On June 12 , the Christian Democrats and the Peasant Popular Union met and decided to ask Kazys Bizauskas and Juozas <unk> to resign from the cabinet , expecting that these resignations would trigger a government crisis . The opposition saw Soviet pressure as a means of ousting Smetona 's regime , restoring democracy , and preserving some form of autonomy . The opposition also hoped to persuade Merkys , who had just returned from Moscow , to resign along with the rest of the cabinet . However , Merkys could not be found — he was apparently resting at his estate near Kaunas . This episode was harshly criticized afterwards as an illustration of several weaknesses in the Lithuanian government : it underestimated the threat posed by the Soviet Union , it was disoriented during the crisis , and its members focused on party interests rather than national priorities . Algirdas Julien <unk> later described the opposition ′ s actions as a " joyful dance next to the corpse of the lost state " . 
 = = = Military movements = = = 
 Mobilization of the Red Army had begun before the last round of meetings in Moscow . On June 7 , the Army was ordered to prepare for an attack against Lithuania . As of June 5 , all Soviet forces in the Baltic region were assigned to command of Semyon Timoshenko , People 's Commissar for Defense . The Soviets gathered their forces on Lithuania ′ s eastern border in modern @-@ day Belarus ; they consisted of five divisions and supporting units from the 3rd and the 11th Armies . The armies included 221 @,@ 260 soldiers , operating 1 @,@ 140 airplanes and 1 @,@ 513 tanks . Lithuania already housed 18 @,@ 786 Soviet troops within its territory . At the time the Lithuanian Army comprised 28 @,@ 005 troops and owned 118 planes . The Soviets readied hospitals for the wounded and prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camps . On June 11 , under the command of General Dmitry Pavlov , the Soviets finalized their attack plan and assigned specific tasks to all units . The orders were to cross the border silently , use bayonets as gunshots would be noticed , and to maneuver around defensive forces in order to occupy the territory more quickly . The Soviets expected to take control of the entire territory in three to four days . 
 On the night of June 14 , while the Lithuanian government was discussing the ultimatum , Soviet soldiers began actions at the border . They fired shots at a border post near <unk> and killed policeman <unk> <unk> . At other points the Soviets interrogated Lithuanian border guards and harassed civilians , hoping to provoke a retaliation that would serve as a rationale for a full @-@ scale military attack . 
 = = Ultimatum and acceptance = = 
 Just before midnight on June 14 , while the world was focused on the imminent capitulation of Paris , Molotov presented the ultimatum to Urbšys in Moscow . It reiterated the earlier charges of kidnapping Soviet soldiers and conspiracy with Latvia and Estonia . The ultimatum demanded : 
 That Skučas and Povilaitis be put on trial for ordering the Soviet soldiers to be kidnapped ; 
 That a government , more capable of adhering to the Mutual Assistance Pact , be formed ; 
 That an unspecified , but " sufficiently large " number of Soviet troops be allowed to enter Lithuanian territory ; 
 That an answer be given by 10 : 00 am the next morning . 
 The Lithuanian government — given less than 12 hours to respond — debated the ultimatum during the night session . It was clear that no matter how the government responded , the Soviet army would invade Lithuania . President Antanas Smetona agreed only with the demand to form a new government argued for military resistance , even if it were symbolic . Merkys and his deputy Kazys Bizauskas urged acceptance . Soviet troops were stationed in Lithuania since October 1939 and acted honorably – the Soviets would surely continue to be reasonable . Bizauskas , a member of the opposition , saw the ultimatum as an opportunity to get rid of the Smetona regime . Historians cited his attitudes to illustrate his incomprehension of the dire situation . Raštikis , as the potential head of a new government , was invited to the meeting . Both former and current Chief Military Commanders Raštikis and Vincas <unk> reported that mounting an effective armed resistance , when Soviet troops were already in the country and the Lithuanian military was not mobilized , was impossible . The government also rejected a diplomatic protest . In Raštikis ' view , such actions were empty and would do no more than anger the Russians and Urbšys , calling from Moscow , urged not to needlessly antagonize the Russians . Merkys and his cabinet resigned to make way for a new government led by Raštikis . The session ended at 7 am with a decision to accept all Russian demands without expressing protest or complaint . 
 By noon , the Lithuanians received a reply from Moscow stating that Raštikis was not a suitable candidate for Prime Minister . The selection of another candidate would be supervised by Molotov 's deputy Vladimir Dekanozov . Merkys continued to act as Prime Minister . Smetona , who continued to disagree with the majority of his government , decided to leave the country in protest and appointed Merkys as acting President . By late evening on June 15 , Smetona and Minister of Defense Kazys <unk> reached <unk> and crossed the border into Germany , where they were granted temporary asylum . The Lithuanian guards did not allow them to pass ; thus , Smetona had to wade across the shallow <unk> rivulet . Smetona ′ s departure worked to the Soviets ′ advantage ; its indignity opened him to ridicule and they were able to exploit the sentiments against him without fearing that he would be seen as a martyr . By fleeing , Smetona escaped the fate of Latvian President Kārlis <unk> and Estonian President Konstantin <unk> , who were manipulated by the Soviets and later arrested . Under the Lithuanian constitution , Merkys became acting president . 
 The Red Army was scheduled to enter Lithuanian territory from three separate directions at 3 : 00 pm and had orders to take control of Vilnius , Kaunas , <unk> , <unk> , and Šiauliai . The Lithuanian Army was ordered not to resist and to extend friendly greetings ; its air force was ordered to remain on the ground . The Soviets came in great numbers clogging Lithuanian roads . They had an obvious intention to show power and intimidate any resistance . Writer Ignas <unk> claimed that he observed the same squadron of Soviet planes making the same flight over and over again to create an impression of much larger Soviet Air Forces . 
 On June 16 , nearly identical <unk> were issued to Latvia and Estonia , although they were given only eight hours to respond . With Lithuania already in Soviet hands , armed resistance in Latvia or Estonia was even more futile . All three states were occupied and lost their independence . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 = = = <unk> of the occupation = = = 
 One of Dekanozov ′ s primary goals was the organization of a puppet government that would legitimize the occupation . On June 16 , the Lithuanian government , exceeding its authority , decided that Smetona 's emigration was in effect a resignation and granted Merkys full presidential powers . On June 17 , Merkys appointed <unk> <unk> the new Prime Minister and confirmed the new government , known as the People 's Government . Merkys and Urbšys then resigned ; both would later be arrested and deported to Russia . <unk> assumed the presidency and appointed writer Vincas <unk> @-@ <unk> as Prime Minister . The People 's Government included several well @-@ known politicians and public figures to reassure the public that the new government was not a tool of Soviet occupation , but a simple replacement of the authoritarian Smetona regime . Since there had been strong opposition to Smetona 's rule , it was interpreted by some Lithuanians as a destruction of presidential power rather than as a loss of independence . 
 On July 1 , the People 's Government dissolved the Fourth Seimas of Lithuania and announced a show election for a " People 's Seimas " to be held on July 14 . A new electoral law was adopted on July 5 . The law , in violation of the constitution , specified that only candidate could stand for each seat available in the parliament . It was also worded in such a way to effectively limit the field to the Lithuanian Communist Party and its supporters . The official fraudulent results showed a voter turnout of 95 @.@ 51 % and support of 99 @.@ 19 % to the communist delegates . Officially , however , 39 of the elected delegates were Communists and 40 were independents . During its first session on July 21 , the parliament proclaimed the creation of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and petitioned the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to accept this new republic into the Union . A 20 @-@ member Lithuanian delegation presented the case for incorporation in Moscow on August 1 . The petition was accepted on August 3 and Lithuania became the 14th republic of the Soviet Union . 
 = = = Sovietization of Lithuania = = = 
 Immediately after the occupation , the new government began implementing political , economic , and social Sovietization policies . On July 1 , all cultural and religious organizations were closed . The Communist Party of Lithuania — with some 1 @,@ 500 members , — and its youth branch were designated the only legitimate political entities . Before the elections to the People 's Seimas , the Soviets arrested about 2 @,@ 000 of the most prominent political activists . These arrests paralyzed the opposition . The repressions continued and intensified . An estimated 12 @,@ 000 individuals were imprisoned as " enemies of the people " during the year following the annexation . Between June 14 and June 18 , 1941 , less than a week before the Nazi invasion , some 17 @,@ 000 Lithuanians were deported to Siberia , where many perished due to inhumane living conditions ( see the June deportation ) . 
 All banks ( including all accounts holding over 1 @,@ 000 litas ) , real estate holdings larger than 170 m2 ( 1 @,@ 800 sq ft ) , and private enterprises employing over 20 workers or grossing more than 150 @,@ 000 litas were nationalized . This disruption in management and operations created a sharp drop in production . The Lithuanian litas was artificially depreciated by three to four times less than its actual value and withdrawn by March 1941 . The drop in production , combined with massive spending of appreciated rubles by Russian soldiers and officials , caused widespread shortages . All land was nationalized ; the largest farms were reduced to 30 ha ( 0 @.@ 30 km2 ) , and extra land ( some 575 @,@ 000 ha ( 5 @,@ 750 km2 ) ) was distributed to small farmers . To turn small peasants against large landowners , collectivization was not introduced in Lithuania . In preparation for eventual collectivization , farm taxes were increased by 50 – 200 % and additional heavy in @-@ kind <unk> were enacted . Some farmers were unable to pay the exorbitant new taxes , and about 1 @,@ 100 of the larger ones were put on trial . 
 = = = Nazi occupation = = = 
 On June 22 , 1941 , Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union and within a week took control of all Lithuania . At first the Germans were greeted as liberators from the oppressive Soviet regime . The Lithuanians hoped that the Germans would re @-@ establish their independence or at least allow some degree of autonomy ( similar to the Slovak Republic ) . Organized by the Lithuanian Activist Front ( <unk> ) , Lithuanians rose in the anti @-@ Soviet and pro @-@ Nazi June Uprising , established the short @-@ lived Provisional Government , and declared independence . However , the Germans did not recognize the Provisional Government and established their own civil administration , the Reichskommissariat Ostland . When the Red Army regained control of Lithuania in summer 1944 – January 1945 , the Lithuanian partisans began an armed struggle against the second Soviet occupation . An estimated 30 @,@ 000 partisans and partisan supporters were killed during the guerrilla warfare between 1944 and 1953 . 
 = = Impacts and evaluation = = 
 While unsuccessful , the June Uprising demonstrated that many Lithuanians were determined to be independent . Lithuania would become disillusioned with the Nazi regime and organize resistance , notably the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania , but the Soviet Union remained " Public Enemy Number One . " A Lithuanian perception that Jewish Bolshevism was involved in the occupation strengthened antisemitic attitudes and contributed to Lithuanian participation in the Holocaust . 
 The acceptance of the ultimatum remains a highly controversial topic in Lithuania . Observers criticize the Lithuanian Army , which had been consuming some 20 % of the state budget , for not staging even a symbolic resistance that would have invalidated Soviet claims that the takeover was a " socialist revolution " and a legitimate change of government . Others criticize the government of inaction : there were eight months in which to create contingency plans . Barring armed resistance , diplomatic options remained — the Lithuanian government could have rejected the ultimatum , retreated abroad , and formed a recognized government @-@ in @-@ exile . Historian Alfonsas Eidintas points to a lack of public comprehension of the risk . Negative news about the Soviets was censored and even politicians did not believe the ultimatum would mean a complete loss of independence . Another debate centers on the lack of bloodshed . By accepting the ultimatum , the government may have avoided loss of life at the time , but its submission may also have encouraged later Soviet repressions . The Russian Federation , the successor state of the Soviet Union , continues to dispute whether the events surrounding the ultimatum and the subsequent years that Lithuania spent as a Soviet Socialist Republic constitute an occupation .

 Star Trek is an American science fiction entertainment franchise created by Gene Roddenberry and owned by CBS and Paramount Pictures . The television series Star Trek : The Original Series , Star Trek : The Animated Series , Star Trek : The Next Generation , Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , Star Trek : Voyager , Star Trek : Enterprise , Star Trek : Discovery as well as the Star Trek film franchise make up the franchise 's canon . 
 The first series , now referred to as The Original Series , debuted in 1966 and ran for three seasons on NBC . It followed the galactic adventures of James T. Kirk and the crew of the starship Enterprise , an exploration vessel of a 23rd @-@ century interstellar " United Federation of Planets " . In creating the first Star Trek , Roddenberry was inspired by Westerns such as Wagon Train , the Horatio Hornblower novels and Gulliver 's Travels . In fact , the original series was originally described as Wagon Train to the Stars . These adventures continued in the short @-@ lived Star Trek : The Animated Series and six feature films . Four spin @-@ off television series were eventually produced : Star Trek : The Next Generation followed the crew of a new starship Enterprise set a century after the original series ; Star Trek : Deep Space Nine and Star Trek : Voyager , set contemporaneously with The Next Generation ; and Star Trek : Enterprise , set before the original series , in the early days of human interstellar travel . Four additional The Next Generation feature films were produced . In 2009 , the film franchise underwent a relaunch with a prequel to the original series set in an alternate timeline titled simply Star Trek . This film featured a new cast portraying younger versions of the crew from the original show . A sequel to that film , Star Trek Into Darkness , premiered on May 16 , 2013 . A thirteenth film feature and sequel , Star Trek Beyond , was released in July 2016 , to coincide with the franchise 's 50th anniversary . A new Star Trek TV series , titled Star Trek : Discovery , will premiere in January 2017 on the digital platform CBS All Access . 
 Star Trek has been a cult phenomenon for decades . Fans of the franchise are called Trekkies or <unk> . The franchise spans a wide range of spin @-@ offs including games , figurines , novels , toys , and comics . Star Trek had a themed attraction in Las Vegas that opened in 1998 and closed in September 2008 . At least two museum exhibits of props travel the world . The series has its own full @-@ fledged constructed language , Klingon . Several parodies have been made of Star Trek . In addition , viewers have produced several fan productions . 
 Star Trek is noted for its influence on the world outside of science fiction . It has been cited as an inspiration for several technological inventions , including the cell phone and tablet computers . The franchise is also noted for its progressive civil rights stances . The Original Series included one of television 's first multiracial casts . Star Trek references can be found throughout popular culture from movies such as the submarine thriller Crimson Tide to the animated series South Park . 
 = = Conception and setting = = 
 As early as 1964 , Gene Roddenberry drafted a proposal for the science @-@ fiction series that would become Star Trek . Although he publicly marketed it as a Western in outer space — a so @-@ called " Wagon Train to the Stars " ( like the popular Western TV series ) — he privately told friends that he was modeling it on Jonathan Swift 's Gulliver 's Travels , intending each episode to act on two levels : as a suspenseful adventure story and as a morality tale . 
 Most Star Trek stories depict the adventures of humans and aliens who serve in Starfleet , the space @-@ borne humanitarian and peacekeeping armada of the United Federation of Planets . The protagonists have altruistic values , and must apply these ideals to difficult dilemmas . 
 Many of the conflicts and political dimensions of Star Trek represent allegories of contemporary cultural realities . Star Trek : The Original Series addressed issues of the 1960s , just as later spin @-@ offs have reflected issues of their respective decades . Issues depicted in the various series include war and peace , the value of personal loyalty , authoritarianism , imperialism , class warfare , economics , racism , religion , human rights , sexism , feminism , and the role of technology . Roddenberry stated : " [ By creating ] a new world with new rules , I could make statements about sex , religion , Vietnam , politics , and intercontinental missiles . Indeed , we did make them on Star Trek : we were sending messages and fortunately they all got by the network . " 
 Roddenberry intended the show to have a progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter @-@ culture of the youth movement , though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this . He wanted Star Trek to show humanity what it might develop into , if it would learn from the lessons of the past , most specifically by ending violence . An extreme example is the alien species , the Vulcans , who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions . Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti @-@ war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal , optimistic version of the United Nations . His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability , e.g. , they opposed Roddenberry 's insistence that the Enterprise have a racially diverse crew . 
 Star Trek has also been accused of evincing racism and imperialism , however , by frequently depicting Starfleet and the Federation trying to impose their values and customs on other planets . 
 = = Mythology = = 
 The central trio of Kirk , Spock and McCoy from Star Trek : The Original Series was modeled on classical mythological storytelling . 
 William Shatner said : “ There is a mythological component [ to pop culture ] , especially with science fiction . It ’ s people looking for answers – and science fiction offers to explain the inexplicable , the same as religion tends to do … If we accept the premise that it has a mythological element , then all the stuff about going out into space and meeting new life – trying to explain it and put a human element to it – it ’ s a hopeful vision . All these things offer hope and imaginative solutions for the future . ” 
 Richard Lutz wrote : “ The enduring popularity of Star Trek is due to the underlying mythology which binds fans together by virtue of their shared love of stories involving exploration , discovery , adventure and friendship that promote an egalitarian and peace loving society where technology and diversity are valued rather than feared and citizens work together for the greater good . Thus Star Trek offers a hopeful vision of the future and a template for our lives and our society that we can aspire to . ”

 In early 1964 , Roddenberry presented a brief treatment for a proposed Star Trek TV series to Desilu Productions comparing it to Wagon Train , " a Wagon Train to the stars . " Desilu worked with Roddenberry to develop the treatment into a script , which was then pitched to NBC . 
 NBC paid to make a pilot , " The Cage " , starring Jeffrey Hunter as Enterprise Captain Christopher Pike . NBC rejected The Cage , but the executives were still impressed with the concept , and made the unusual decision to commission a second pilot : " Where No Man Has Gone Before " . 
 The first regular episode ( " The Man Trap " ) of Star Trek : The Original Series aired on Thursday , September 8 , 1966 . While the show initially enjoyed high ratings , the average rating of the show at the end of its first season dropped to 52nd ( out of 94 programs ) . 
 Unhappy with the show 's ratings , NBC threatened to cancel the show during its second season . The show 's fan base , led by <unk> Trimble , conducted an unprecedented letter @-@ writing campaign , petitioning the network to keep the show on the air . NBC renewed the show , but moved it from primetime to the " Friday night death slot " , and substantially reduced its budget . In protest Roddenberry resigned as producer and reduced his direct involvement in Star Trek , which led to Fred Freiberger becoming producer for the show 's third and final season . Despite another letter @-@ writing campaign , NBC cancelled the series after three seasons and 79 episodes .

 After the original series was cancelled , Paramount Studios , which had bought the series from Desilu , licensed the broadcast syndication rights to help recoup the production losses . Reruns began in the fall of 1969 and by the late 1970s the series aired in over 150 domestic and 60 international markets . This helped Star Trek develop a cult following greater than its popularity during its original run . 
 One sign of the series ' growing popularity was the first Star Trek convention which occurred on January 21 – 23 , 1972 in New York City . Although the original estimate of attendees was only a few hundred , several thousand fans turned up . Star Trek fans continue to attend similar conventions worldwide . 
 The series ' newfound success led to the idea of reviving the franchise . Filmation with Paramount Television produced the first post original series show , Star Trek : The Animated Series . It ran on NBC for 22 half @-@ hour episodes over two seasons on Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1974 . Although short @-@ lived , typical for animated productions in that time slot during that period , the series garnered the franchise 's only " Best Series " Emmy Award as opposed to the franchise 's later technical ones . Paramount Pictures and Roddenberry began developing a new series , Star Trek : Phase II , in May 1975 in response to the franchise 's newfound popularity . Work on the series ended , however , when the proposed Paramount Television Service folded . 
 Following the success of the science fiction movies Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind , Paramount adapted the planned pilot episode of Phase II into the feature film , Star Trek : The Motion Picture . The film opened in North America on December 7 , 1979 , with mixed reviews from critics . The film earned $ 139 million worldwide , below expectations but enough for Paramount to create a sequel . The studio forced Roddenberry to relinquish creative control of future sequels . 
 The success of the critically acclaimed sequel , Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan , reversed the fortunes of the franchise . While the sequel grossed less than the first movie , The Wrath of Khan 's lower production costs made it net more profit . Paramount produced six Star Trek feature films between 1979 and 1991 . In response to the popularity of Star Trek feature films , the franchise returned to television with Star Trek : The Next Generation ( TNG ) in 1987 . Paramount chose to distribute it as a first @-@ run syndication show rather than a network show . 
 = = = After Roddenberry = = = 
 Following Star Trek : The Motion Picture , Roddenberry 's role was changed from producer to creative consultant with minimal input to the films while being heavily involved with the creation of Star Trek : The Next Generation . Roddenberry died on October 24 , 1991 , giving executive producer Rick Berman control of the franchise . Star Trek had become known to those within Paramount as " the franchise " , because of its great success and recurring role as a tent pole for the studio when other projects failed . TNG had the highest ratings of any Star Trek series and became the # 1 syndicated show during the last years of its original seven @-@ season run . In response to TNG 's success , Paramount released a spin @-@ off series Deep Space Nine in 1993 . While never as popular as TNG , the series had sufficient ratings for it to last seven seasons . 
 In January 1995 , a few months after TNG ended , Paramount released a fourth TV series , Voyager . Star Trek saturation reached a peak in the mid @-@ 1990s with DS9 and Voyager airing concurrently and three of the four TNG @-@ based feature films released in 1994 , 1996 , and 1998 . By 1998 , Star Trek was Paramount 's most important property ; the enormous profits of " the franchise " funded much of the rest of the studio 's operations . Voyager became the flagship show of the new United Paramount Network ( UPN ) and thus the first major network Star Trek series since the original . 
 After Voyager ended , UPN produced Enterprise , a prequel TV series to the original show . Enterprise did not enjoy the high ratings of its predecessors and UPN threatened to cancel it after the series ' third season . Fans launched a campaign reminiscent of the one that saved the third season of the Original Series . Paramount renewed Enterprise for a fourth season , but moved it to the Friday night death slot . Like the Original Series , Enterprise ratings dropped during this time slot , and UPN cancelled Enterprise at the end of its fourth season . Enterprise aired its final episode on May 13 , 2005 . Fan groups , " Save Enterprise " , attempted to save the series and tried to raise $ 30 million to privately finance a fifth season of Enterprise . Though the effort garnered considerable press , the fan drive failed to save the series . The cancellation of Enterprise ended an eighteen @-@ year continuous production run of Star Trek programming on television . The poor box office performance in 2002 of the film Nemesis , cast an uncertain light upon the future of the franchise . Paramount relieved Berman , the franchise producer , of control of Star Trek . 
 = = = Reboot = = = 
 Paramount turned down several proposals in the mid @-@ 2000s to restart the franchise . These included pitches from film director Bryan Singer , Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski , and Trek actors Jonathan Frakes and William Shatner . The studio also turned down an animated web series . Instead , Paramount hired a new creative team to reinvigorate the franchise in 2007 . Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and Lost producer , J. J. Abrams , had the freedom to reinvent the feel of Trek . 
 The team created the franchise 's eleventh film , titled simply Star Trek , releasing it in May 2009 . The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original show . Star Trek was a prequel of the original series set in an alternate timeline . This gave the film and future sequels to it freedom from the need to conform to the franchise 's canonical timeline . The eleventh Star Trek film 's marketing campaign targeted non @-@ fans , even stating in the film 's advertisements that " this is not your father 's Star Trek " . 
 The film earned considerable critical and financial success , grossing in inflation @-@ adjusted dollars more box office sales than any previous Star Trek film . The plaudits include the franchise 's first Academy Award ( for makeup ) . The film 's major cast members are contracted for two sequels . Paramount 's sequel to the 2009 film , Star Trek Into Darkness , premiered in Sydney , Australia on April 23 , 2013 , but the film did not release in the United States until May 17 , 2013 . While the film was not as successful in the North American box office as its predecessor , internationally , in terms of box office receipts , Into Darkness was the most successful of the franchise . A thirteenth film entitled Star Trek Beyond was released on July 22 , 2016 . 
 Star Trek will return to subscription @-@ television in January 2017 . The new series , titled Star Trek : Discovery , will be the first series produced specifically for CBS All Access . Episodes will also be <unk> on Netflix within 24 hours of their U.S. premieres .

 Six television series make up the bulk of the Star Trek mythos : The Original Series , The Animated Series , The Next Generation , Deep Space Nine , Voyager , and Enterprise . All the different versions in total amount to 726 Star Trek episodes across the 30 seasons of the TV series .

 Star Trek : The Original Series or " TOS " debuted in the United States on NBC on September 8 , 1966 . The show tells the tale of the crew of the starship Enterprise and its five @-@ year mission " to boldly go where no man has gone before . " The original 1966 – 1969 television series featured William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk , Leonard Nimoy as Spock , DeForest Kelley as Dr. Leonard " Bones " McCoy , James Doohan as Montgomery " Scotty " Scott , Nichelle Nichols as Uhura , George Takei as Hikaru Sulu , and Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov . During the series ' original run , it earned several nominations for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and won twice : for the two @-@ parter " The Menagerie " and the Harlan Ellison @-@ written episode " The City on the Edge of Forever " . 
 NBC canceled the show after three seasons ; the last original episode aired on June 3 , 1969 . The petition near the end of the second season to save the show signed by many Caltech students and its multiple Hugo nominations would , however , indicate that despite low Nielsen ratings , it was highly popular with science fiction fans and engineering students . The series later became popular in reruns and found a cult following . 
 = = = The Animated Series ( 1973 – 74 ) = = = 
 Star Trek : The Animated Series , produced by Filmation , ran for two seasons from 1973 to 1974 . Most of the original cast performed the voices of their characters from The Original Series , and many of the writers who worked on The Original Series , D. C. Fontana , David Gerrold , and Paul Schneider , wrote for the series . While the animated format allowed the producers to create more exotic alien landscapes and life forms , animation errors and liberal reuse of shots and musical cues have tarnished the series ' reputation . Although it was originally sanctioned by Paramount , which owned the Star Trek franchise following its acquisition of Desilu in 1967 , Gene Roddenberry often spoke of TAS as non @-@ canon . Star Trek writers have used elements of the animated series in later live @-@ action series and movies , and as of June 2007 , the Animated Series has references in the library section of the official <unk> web site officially bringing the series into the franchise 's main canon . 
 The Animated Series won Star Trek 's first Emmy Award on May 15 , 1975 . Star Trek TAS briefly returned to television in the mid @-@ 1980s on the children 's cable network Nickelodeon . Nickelodeon 's Evan McGuire greatly admired the show and used its various creative components as inspiration for his short series called <unk> Wiggly Hears A Sound which never aired . Nickelodeon parent Viacom would purchase Paramount in 1994 . In the early 1990s , the Sci @-@ Fi Channel also began <unk> TAS . The complete TAS was also released on Laserdisc format during the 1980s . The complete series was first released in the USA on eleven volumes of VHS tapes in 1989 . All 22 episodes were released on DVD in 2006 .

 Star Trek : The Next Generation , also known as " TNG " , takes place about a century after The Original Series ( 2364 – 2370 ) . It features a new starship , the Enterprise @-@ D , and a new crew led by Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) and Commander William Riker ( Jonathan Frakes ) . Some crewmembers represent new alien races , including Deanna Troi , a half @-@ Betazoid counselor played by Marina Sirtis . Michael Dorn plays Worf , the first Klingon officer in Starfleet , alongside Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher , LeVar Burton as chief engineer Geordi La Forge , the android Data portrayed by Brent Spiner , and Dr. Crusher 's son Wesley Crusher played by Wil Wheaton . The show premiered on September 28 , 1987 , and ran for seven seasons , ending on May 23 , 1994 . It had the highest ratings of any of the Star Trek series and became the # 1 syndicated show during the last few years of its original run , allowing it to act as a springboard for ideas in other series . Many relationships and races introduced in TNG became the basis of episodes in Deep Space 9 and Voyager . During its run it earned several Emmy awards and nominations – including a nomination for Best Dramatic Series during its final season – two Hugo Awards and a Peabody Award for Outstanding Television Programming for the episode " The Big Goodbye " . 
 = = = Deep Space Nine ( 1993 – 99 ) = = = 
 Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , also known as " DS9 " , takes place during the last years and the immediate post @-@ years of The Next Generation ( <unk> – 2375 ) and aired for seven seasons , debuting the week of January 3 , 1993 . Like Star Trek : The Next Generation , it aired in syndication in the United States and Canada . Unlike the other Star Trek series , DS9 takes place primarily on a space station rather than aboard a starship . 
 The show begins after the brutal Cardassian occupation of the planet Bajor . The liberated Bajoran people ask the United Federation of Planets to help run a Cardassian built space station , Deep Space Nine , near Bajor . After the Federation takes control of the station , the protagonists of the show discover a uniquely stable wormhole that provides immediate access to the distant Gamma Quadrant making Bajor and the station one of the most strategically important locations in the galaxy . The show chronicles the events of the station 's crew , led by Commander ( later Captain ) Benjamin Sisko , played by Avery Brooks , and Major ( later Colonel ) Kira Nerys , played by Nana Visitor . Recurring plot elements include the repercussions of the Cardassian occupation of Bajor , Sisko 's spiritual role for the Bajorans as the Emissary of the Prophets , and in later seasons a war with the Dominion . 
 Deep Space Nine stands apart from earlier Trek series for its lengthy serialized storytelling , conflict within the crew , and religious themes — all elements that critics and audiences praised but Roddenberry forbade in the original series and The Next Generation . Nevertheless , he was informed before his death of DS9 , making this the last Star Trek series connected to Gene Roddenberry . 
 = = = Voyager ( 1995 – 2001 ) = = = 
 Star Trek : Voyager ran for seven seasons , airing from January 16 , 1995 , to May 23 , 2001 , launching a new Paramount @-@ owned television network UPN . It features Kate Mulgrew as Captain Kathryn Janeway , the first female commanding officer in a leading role of a Star Trek series , and Commander Chakotay , played by Robert Beltran . 
 Voyager takes place at about the same time period as Deep Space Nine and the years following that show 's end ( <unk> – <unk> ) . The premiere episode has the USS Voyager and its crew pursue a Maquis ( Federation rebels ) ship . Both ships become stranded in the Delta Quadrant about 70 @,@ 000 light @-@ years from Earth . Faced with a 75 @-@ year voyage to Earth , the crew must learn to work together to overcome challenges on their long and perilous journey home while also seeking ways to shorten the voyage . Like Deep Space Nine , early seasons of Voyager feature more conflict between its crewmembers than seen in later episodes . Such conflict often arises from friction between " by @-@ the @-@ book " Starfleet crew and rebellious Maquis fugitives forced by circumstance to work together on Voyager . Eventually , though , they settle their differences , after which the overall tone becomes more reminiscent of The Original Series . The starship Voyager , isolated from its home , faces new cultures and dilemmas not possible in shows based in the Alpha Quadrant . Later seasons , however , brought an influx of characters and cultures from prior shows , the Borg , Q , the Ferengi , Romulans , Klingons , Cardassians and cast members of The Next Generation . 
 = = = Enterprise ( 2001 – 05 ) = = = 
 Star Trek : Enterprise , originally titled Enterprise , is a prequel to the original Star Trek series . It aired from September 26 , 2001 to May 13 , 2005 . Enterprise takes place in the <unk> , some 90 years after the events of Zefram Cochrane 's first warp flight and about a decade before the founding of the Federation . The show centers on the voyages of Earth 's first warp @-@ five capable starship , the Enterprise , commanded by Captain Jonathan Archer ( played by Scott Bakula ) , and the Vulcan Sub @-@ Commander T 'Pol ( played by Jolene Blalock ) . 
 During the show 's first two seasons , Enterprise featured self @-@ contained episodes , like The Original Series , The Next Generation and Voyager . The third season consisted of one arc , " Xindi mission " , which had a darker tone and serialized nature similar to that of Deep Space 9 . Season 4 consisted of several two to three episode mini @-@ arcs . The final season showed the origins of elements seen in earlier series , and it rectified and resolved some core continuity problems between the various Star Trek series . Ratings for Enterprise started strong but declined rapidly . Although critics received the fourth season well , both fans and the cast reviled the series finale , partly because of the episode 's focus on the guest appearance of members of The Next Generation cast . The cancellation of Enterprise ended an 18 @-@ year run of back @-@ to @-@ back new Star Trek shows beginning with The Next Generation in 1987 .

 In 2013 , Star Trek Magazine was a significant publication from the U.K. which was sold at newsstands and also via subscription .

 = = Cultural impact = = 
 The Star Trek media franchise is a multibillion @-@ dollar industry , owned by CBS . Gene Roddenberry sold Star Trek to NBC as a classic adventure drama ; he pitched the show as " Wagon Train to the Stars " and as Horatio Hornblower in Space . The opening line , " to boldly go where no man has gone before , " was taken almost verbatim from a U.S. White House booklet on space produced after the Sputnik flight in 1957 . The central trio of Kirk , Spock , and McCoy was modeled on classical mythological storytelling . 
 Star Trek and its spin @-@ offs have proven highly popular in syndication and are shown on TV stations worldwide . The show 's cultural impact goes far beyond its longevity and profitability . Star Trek conventions have become popular among its fans , who call themselves " trekkies " or " trekkers " . An entire subculture has grown up around the show which was documented in the film Trekkies . Star Trek was the highest @-@ ranked cult show by TV Guide . The franchise has also garnered many comparisons of the Star Wars franchise being rivals in the science fiction genre with many fans and scholars . 
 The Star Trek franchise inspired some designers of technologies , the Palm PDA and the handheld mobile phone .

The <unk> X Prize , a contest to build a medical tricorder device was announced in 2012 . Ten finalists have been selected in 2014 , and the winner will be selected in January 2016 . Star Trek also brought teleportation to popular attention with its depiction of " matter @-@ energy transport " , with the famously misquoted phrase " Beam me up , Scotty " entering the vernacular . The Star Trek replicator is credited in the scientific literature with inspiring the field of diatom nanotechnology . In 1976 , following a letter @-@ writing campaign , NASA named its prototype space shuttle Enterprise , after the fictional starship . Later , the introductory sequence to Star Trek : Enterprise included footage of this shuttle which , along with images of a naval sailing vessel called the Enterprise , depicted the advancement of human transportation technology . 
 Beyond Star Trek 's fictional innovations , its contributions to TV history included a multicultural and multiracial cast . While more common in subsequent years , in the 1960s it was controversial to feature an Enterprise crew that included a Japanese helmsman , a Russian navigator , a black female communications officer , and a Vulcan @-@ Human first officer .

He fought with distinction in the wars between the Habsburg and the Ottoman empires , the French Revolutionary Wars , and the Napoleonic Wars . 
 Maximilian entered the military as a young man , and acquired his first combat experiences the Habsburg wars with the Ottoman Empire . Following his experience in the Balkans , he retreated to the cloister at Bonn , where he spent a year as a novice in the Teutonic Order . At the outbreak of war between Austria and France in 1792 , he returned to military service , and proved an intrepid and enterprising cavalry field officer . His role in the Austrian victory at Neerwinden in 1793 earned him the honor of conveying the news to the Emperor in Vienna . 
 In the War of the Second Coalition , Maximilian served in Swabia and northern Italy and Switzerland . In subsequent wars between France and Austria , his role on the battlefield often meant the difference between defeat and victory . He was wounded and captured at the Battle of Leipzig and , as a condition of release , he agreed not to bear arms against France again .

In the wars between Austria and the Ottoman Empire , ( 1787 – 1791 ) , he was a Rittmeister , or captain of cavalry and wing adjutant to Field Marshal Franz Moritz , Count von Lacy .

There , he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 7 July 1794 . Subsequently , he was appointed as an attaché to the staff of Frederick , Duke of York . 
 In the 1794 campaign , Merveldt fought at the Battle of <unk> and again at the Battle of Villers @-@ en @-@ <unk> , 15 kilometres ( 9 mi ) south of Landrecies on 22 April , during which he commanded the right wing . After the Battle of Tournai ( 22 May 1794 ) , he was promoted on the field to Oberst ( colonel ) . His failing health prevented him from continued field service and he took sick leave until early 1796 . In 1796 he transferred to the 18th Chevau @-@ légers Regiment <unk> and fought at the Battle of <unk> , in the Westerwald , where , despite the French superiority of numbers , the Austrians eked out a victory . At <unk> , with two squadrons of <unk> @-@ <unk> , Merveldt saved the Austrian artillery from French capture , thus contributing to the Austrian victory . The <unk> ( daily dispatch ) of the Army of the Rhine referred to his keen sense of duty , and his ability to seize the moment , which , in this case , proved a vital element in the extraordinary success of the small Austrian force against the considerably larger French one . Afterward he was promoted to major general . He was assigned as proprietor of the First Lancer 's Regiment , and given command of a cavalry brigade in Franz von Werneck 's Reserve of the Army of the Lower Rhine . 
 Merveldt was known to his contemporaries for his strength of will , presence of mind , and his self @-@ control . Those same qualities made him attractive to his military superiors as part of the negotiation party in the cease @-@ fire preliminaries at Leoben in 1797 . He opposed Napoleon 's desire to move a general peace congress closer to Vienna , and later was a co @-@ <unk> of the Peace of Campo Formio on 17 November 1797 . He brought the document to Rastatt , where the Rastatt Peace Congress convened . He stayed in Rastatt in the capacity of ambassador .

 At the outbreak of the War of the Second Coalition in March 1799 , and the dissolution of Congress on 7 April 1799 , Merveldt returned to his regiment , which by this time had crossed the Lech and Iller rivers , and was advancing into Swabia . During the campaigns of 1800 , he commanded the left wing by <unk> at the Battle of Alt @-@ <unk> on 25 April , and on 10 May conducted a rear @-@ guard action to protect the Imperial army 's withdrawal . He remained with his brigade on the right bank of the Danube , where he directed a series of bold actions against the French , and then along the Iller and Lech rivers , he organized a series of well @-@ timed thrusts designed to keep the French from pushing the retreating army . After the battle at Offenburg , he was promoted to lieutenant field marshal on 4 September 1800 . At the Austrian defeat in the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December , Merveldt commanded a division in the left wing . He signed the 24 @-@ hour cease @-@ fire at <unk> with Jean Victor Moreau on 22 December . During the cease @-@ fire , he retreated to Pressburg .

 In 1805 he was in Berlin when the hostilities between France and Austria resumed , and he returned to the Danube valley , where he fought a series of rearguard actions . He avoided being caught in the capitulation of Ulm and fell back toward Mikhail Kutuzov 's Russian army . With 6 @,@ 000 soldiers in six line and ten Grenz infantry battalions plus 14 squadrons of cavalry , Merveldt made for Styria , hoping to join the army of Archduke Charles . Napoleon detached Louis Davout 's III Corps in pursuit . Slowed by heavy snow in the mountains , his " poorly @-@ handled corps " was overtaken by the French at Gross @-@ <unk> , also called <unk> , in the Austrian Steiermark , on 8 November . His exhausted troops were routed by General of Brigade Etienne <unk> de Bierre 's advanced guard of Davout 's III Corps ; half , about 2 @,@ 000 , were taken prisoner , and they lost four colors and 16 guns . 
 After the War of the Third Coalition , he acted as ambassador to St. Petersburg for over two years , with the assignment of improving military relations between the armies of the respective countries . He attempted to do this , including trying an offer to mediate between Britain and France , and was appointed Privy Councilor . During this time , he married Maria Theresia Gräfin von <unk> . 
 In 1808 he was given command of a cavalry division in Lemberg . In early 1809 , Merveldt became a prominent member of the group pushing for war against France , together with such notables as Archduke Ferdinand , Archduke John , Empress Maria Ludovika of Austria @-@ Este , and Count Heinrich von Bellegarde . In the 1809 campaign , Merveldt 's force was stationed in the <unk> and part of Galicia , and from 1809 to mid @-@ 1813 , he spent three years in Moravia . 
 On 22 July 1813 he was appointed governor of the fortress of Theresienstadt and shortly after that Commanding General in Moravia and Silesia . He then became commander of II Corps ; the First Division held the village of <unk> , in the French defeat at the Battle of Kulm ( now <unk> ) on 29 – 30 August 1813 . 
 On 16 October , during the Battle of Leipzig , Merveldt 's forces were arrayed on the right flank of the French center , commanded by Napoleon . On his own right stood Wittgenstein 's Corps , and beyond that , Johann von Klenau 's . His troops were interspersed among several wooded sections and surrounding several small villages : <unk> , Mark @-@ <unk> and <unk> . Opposite him were the forces of Józef Antoni Poniatowski and Pierre Augereau . He rode out to view the battlefield and to direct the disposition of his force . Near <unk> , which lay close to the French line , he wandered into a troop of Hungarians , or so he thought , but they were actually a mixed group of Saxons and Poles , whom he mistook for Hungarians , and was captured . Most of the action , on the first day , occurred to the north , where Blücher 's Prussians repelled Michel Ney 's cavalry , but when Napoleon heard that Ney and Marmont had been forced back , he sought a cease @-@ fire from the Allied monarchs . He called for Merveldt , and , after a meeting , Merveldt carried Napoleon 's proposal to the allied monarchs , which they refused . 
 = = = Final diplomatic missions = = = 
 As a condition of his release at Leipzig , he agreed not to participate in combat against France . Subsequent to his release , Merveldt was appointed commanding general of Moravia , and lived in Brno , where he received in January 1814 the instructions to proceed to London as an envoy extraordinaire to the Court of St. James 's , replacing Baron <unk> . He arrived in London in early March , and met the Prince Regent at Carlton House on 7 March 1814 , where he ceremoniously presented his ambassadorial credentials . He was well @-@ received in Britain , and became a notable personage , invited to many social events ; he told good stories about the wars and the various people he had encountered , which made him popular in social circles . His comings and goings were widely reported in the society columns : For example , on 4 July 1814 , he attended a lecture by the Abbé <unk> , and was listed among the distinguished persons present . When he died in 1815 , the British government proposed to bury him at Westminster Abbey . However , his widow took into account his last wishes and had the remains sent to Germany . He was buried in the crypt of the Michaelis <unk> in Lembeck Castle where his grave still exists . 
 In 1903 , in the <unk> neighborhood of the city of Leipzig a square and a street were named after Maximilian von Merveldt , in honor of his contribution to the Battle of Leipzig . In 1950 , the communist authorities of East Germany renamed Merveldt square to Rembrandt square and Merveldt street to <unk> street .

 = The American Bible Challenge = 
 The American Bible Challenge is a Biblical @-@ themed American television game show created by Game Show Network . The series is hosted by Jeff Foxworthy , with Kirk Franklin joining Foxworthy as co @-@ host and announcer in the second season . The series debuted on August 23 , 2012 . 
 The game involves three teams consisting of three contestants each answering questions to display their knowledge of the Bible . At the end of the main game , the teams utilize only their strongest contestants to answer questions by themselves without any assistance from their teammates . Once the main game is completed , the two highest @-@ scoring teams compete in a final round with the scores being reset to zero . The remaining teams answer as many questions correctly as possible within one minute ; the highest @-@ scoring team from this round wins a $ 20 @,@ 000 prize . 
 The show became GSN 's highest rated original program in the history of the network . In 2014 , The American Bible Challenge received two nominations at the 41st Daytime Emmy Awards , with the series receiving one for Outstanding Game Show , and Foxworthy receiving the other for Outstanding Game Show Host ; however , both the show and Foxworthy lost to Jeopardy ! and Steve Harvey ( host of Family Feud ) respectively . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 = = = Main game = = = 
 To begin the game , a category is revealed , and the three teams of three contestants are asked multiple choice questions under that category , with each question having four possible answers . The contestant that buzzes in with the correct answer earns the respective team 100 points ; an incorrect answer loses 100 points , and opens up the question to the other teams . Contestants must wait until after the host reads the entire question ( including the choices ) to buzz in . 
 Each team then participates in a physical stunt . These stunts involve teams answering questions about Bible characters , with the same set of choices given for each character . For example , in the game " Stick a Fork In It , " the teams must use a spoon to catapult a fork into a glass to select their answer . Where teams compete individually , each team is given 60 seconds ; occasional games where teams compete at the same time are either <unk> ( with the first team to complete the game winning ) or played in 90 seconds . In all cases , the team that wins the stunt receives 200 points ; in case of a tie , each of the teams involved in the tie receives the points . The next round , entitled " Kirk 's Righteous Remix " , features Grammy Award @-@ winner Kirk Franklin and the choir singing songs relating to various books of the Bible . Each team is then given one question based on an announced subject worth 300 points ; no penalty is assessed for an incorrect answer . 
 The teams then set their strongest respective contestants aside for the final round of main gameplay , entitled " The Chosen Three " . These contestants move to an area behind the teams , and cannot participate in this round . The host then asks each team , in turn , a question based on an announced category . Each question in this round is worth 500 points , with no penalty assessed for an incorrect answer . Only the two contestants standing at the podium may confer and answer the question . Two questions are asked to each team in this round . In the " Chosen Three " round , the contestants who were set aside from the previous round stand alone at their podiums , with their teammates standing in the area behind them . The host asks each contestant , in turn , a question with six possible answers , three of which are correct . The contestants then make three selections without conferring with the rest of their respective teams . Each individual correct answer is worth 1 @,@ 000 points , thus , a total of 3 @,@ 000 points are available to each team in this round . The two teams with the highest total scores advance to the final round , while the third @-@ place team is eliminated and leaves with $ 2 @,@ 500 for their charity . 
 = = = The Final Revelation = = = 
 Before this game , entitled " The Final Revelation " , scores from the previous rounds are discarded . The host announces the category for the final round , and gives each team a copy of the Bible . The teams then move to a backstage area , and are permitted 10 minutes to study the Bible for information based on that category . In Season 2 , while backstage , the teams also have the option to use the <unk> App of the Bible on an electronic tablet along with the copy of the Bible . 
 After the 10 minutes are up , the first team comes on @-@ stage , while the second team is placed in a sound @-@ proof booth . The host then asks the team questions from the announced category . Each question is given , in rotation , to one player , who cannot confer with teammates . Both teams play the same set of questions . Each team has a total of 60 seconds to answer as many questions as possible , and the team that answers more questions correctly wins $ 20 @,@ 000 for their charity ; the runners @-@ up win $ 5 @,@ 000 for their charity . Teams that win this round advance to a semi @-@ final game ; the winners of that episode advance to the season finale , where team that wins this round wins $ 100 @,@ 000 for their charity in addition to all winnings from previous episodes . 
 = = = Previous rules = = = 
 Immediately following the first round in season 2 , each team had a chance to earn 25 additional points . Before the show , a question was asked to 100 You @-@ Version App users ( e.g. " Would you rather fast for 40 days or eat manna for 40 years ? " ) . A question with 3 possible choices was then asked about the percentage of people who answered ( e.g. " What percentage said they would rather fast for 40 days than eat manna for 40 years ? " ) . During the break , each team wrote their answer on a tablet computer , and each team that submitted the correct answer earned 25 points . This round was removed from the game in the third season and replaced with another opening round @-@ style game played for ± 100 points a question . 
 = = Production = = 
 The series began development with production staff approaching Troy Schmidt , a pastor at First Baptist Church in Windermere , Florida , to work as both a writer and a consultant for the show . One of Schmidt 's initial roles was to be an " on @-@ camera Bible expert " for the series , one of many aspects of the pilot episode that was rejected by test audiences . GSN was then forced to bring in many new staff members during a six @-@ week period and made various changes to the show 's format . 
 After these changes were made , the test audience became more appreciative of the series , and GSN announced its development to the public at an upfront presentation in New York City on March 21 , 2012 for the network 's upcoming programming . By this time , a pilot episode had already been shot with American stand @-@ up comedian and television personality Jeff Foxworthy providing the hosting duties for the show . When first asked if he was interested in hosting the show , Foxworthy was hesitant ; however , he was " sold " on providing hosting duties when he learned contestants would be playing for charity rather than on their own behalf . Casting for the series was held in various cities from May to June 2012 . On July 7 , 2012 , GSN confirmed the premiere date of the show as August 23 , 2012 , alongside the premiere of Beat the Chefs .

 = = Reception = = 
 Despite breaking many ratings records for GSN , the series received mixed reviews from critics . David Hinckley of the New York Daily News gave the series a positive review , saying , " Anyone who knows even a little about the Bible will be unable to resist playing along and matching answers with the teams on the screen " . In addition , Rebecca <unk> of <unk> argued , " Those that take the Bible as the word of God will enjoy this show " . Conversely , Hank Stuever of The Washington Post was critical of the series . Stuever called the show " just as dull as it sounds " , and argued that " weariness " could be detected in Foxworthy 's hosting . 
 The American Bible Challenge was also honored with two Emmy Award nominations at the 41st Daytime Emmy Awards in 2014 . The series received a nomination for Outstanding Game Show , while Foxworthy received one for Outstanding Game Show Host . However , both the show and Foxworthy lost to Jeopardy ! and Steve Harvey of Family Feud respectively . 
 The premiere episode of The American Bible Challenge debuted on August 23 , 2012 , breaking all previous viewership records for GSN .

 = The Tribunal , Glastonbury = 
 The Tribunal in Glastonbury , Somerset , England , was built in the 15th century as a merchant 's house . It has been designated as a Grade I listed building . 
 The history of the building is not well documented , although the majority of the present stone house was constructed in the 15th century on the site of a 12th @-@ century wooden building . The current front wall was added in the 16th century . It has been used as a merchant 's house and possibly a shop and school . It was thought that it was the venue for court proceedings , hence the title Tribunal , however there is no evidence this ever occurred . One of the ground floor rooms still has the window and ceiling panels from the Elizabethan era . The front room upstairs has an arched braced , wooden , truss roof . 
 The building is currently in the guardianship of English Heritage and used as a tourist information centre . On the first floor is the museum of the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society which houses artefacts from Glastonbury Lake Village including the " Glastonbury Bowl " . The bottom part of the bowl dates from the Iron Age and the upper part was added in the 1st century AD . 
 = = History = = 
 The house owes its name to the fact that it was formerly mistakenly identified with the Abbey ’ s tribunals , where secular justice was administered for Glaston Twelve Hides . The name may have been first used by John Collinson in his History and Antiquities of the County of Somerset in 1791 , however <unk> investigated by Richard Warner in 1826 he could not identify where the name had originated . It was also thought to be the site of trials by Judge Jeffreys for the Bloody Assizes after the Monmouth Rebellion . 
 The current building was constructed in the 15th century on the site of a wooden building dating from the 12th century . In the 16th century a new facade was added to the original building . It is possible that the stonework and window of the front wall were removed from the abbot 's lodgings behind the great kitchen of the Abbey as similar features can be identified in a 1712 engraving , and it is known that the building was ruined and without its front wall by 1723 . 
 The door is original and above it are a Tudor rose and the arms of Richard Beere who was Abbot of Glastonbury from 1493 to 1524 . It is possible that the building was used as a hospice in the time of Richard Beere as Abbot as a document of 1716 describes " Beere 's Hospital " although it is uncertain whether this is the same building . <unk> documentary evidence shows that it was used as a " commercial school for young gentlemen " in the second half of the 18th century . It is now in the guardianship of English Heritage and managed by Glastonbury Tribunal Ltd . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The building has two rooms and an attached kitchen on the ground floor with a staircase between them leading to the living quarters in the first floor rooms . The front room may originally have been a shop but was not used for trade after the installation of the new front wall in the 16th century . The front room has recesses on either side of the arched fireplace . The rear room on the ground floor was the hall and still has its 16th @-@ century ceiling panels and four @-@ light window . The ceiling has plaster decorations from the Elizabethan era , when the kitchen block was also added . 
 The wooden stairs leading to the first floor replaced an earlier stone staircase , the remains of which can be seen protruding from the walls . The front room on the first floor had previously been partitioned , but the larger space was created when the new front wall was added to the building . Its roof has arched braced wooden trusses . The rear room still has the remains of a large fireplace , however , the chimney was blocked when the downstairs fireplace was installed . 
 = = Glastonbury Lake Village Museum = = 
 The first floor of the Tribunal now houses the Glastonbury Lake Village Museum containing Iron Age possessions and works of art from the Glastonbury Lake Village , a " crannog " or man made island , which were preserved in almost perfect condition in the peat after the village was abandoned . Glastonbury Lake Village was an Iron Age village on the Somerset Levels near Godney , some 3 miles ( 5 km ) north west of <unk> and covers an area of 400 feet ( 122 m ) north to south by 300 feet ( 91 m ) east to west . 
 The village was built in about 300 BC and occupied into the early Roman period ( around <unk> ) when it was abandoned , possibly due to a rise in the water level . It was built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood , bracken , rubble and clay . The village housed around 100 people in five to seven groups of houses , each for an extended family , with sheds and barns , made of hazel and willow covered with reeds , and surrounded either permanently or at certain times by a wooden palisade . At its maximum it may have had 15 houses with a population of up to 200 people . 
 The exhibits include the metal " Glastonbury Bowl " . It was made from two sections riveted together and repaired several times over its life . The bottom half has been dated as having been constructed in the Iron Age . The upper half was probably added in the 1st century from one sheet of metal , which may have been previously used for another purpose , and the two halves riveted together . Other artefacts that form the village include a clay <unk> from a pair of bellows , whetstones , iron knives and iron currency bars , which could be used as tokens and exchanged for goods . The glazed jar on display is a 1936 copy of one from the village site ; however some of the original storage bowls are included in the displays which were re assembled by Arthur Bulleid , who discovered the site in 1892 . In the old kitchen at the rear of the building is a log boat excavated near the village . 
 The museum is run by the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society . The building also houses the tourist information centre .

During a preview of The 2nd Law on French site <unk> , the song was said to resemble Depeche Mode and described as " calm , languid and sweet " . Matthew Bellamy stated that the song started as a personal reflection after a fight with his girlfriend Kate Hudson , and how , after she had gone to her mother 's house , he began to realise " yeah , she was right , wasn 't she ? " In a separate interview , Bellamy stated the song was the band 's attempt to strip down the sound of the album , and that the song has its roots in 12 bar blues with gospel , soul and R & B influences . He went on to conclude that , " It 's the song I 'm probably most proud of on the album for sure . "

" The track review goes on to call it a brilliant single and jokingly states that Muse have tamed the shark ( following their declaration that Muse had jumped the shark with " Survival " ) . <unk> noted that the single " doesn 't sound like the Muse that established itself as one of the worlds biggest rock bands " but that " the unusual blend of sounds works far better than it probably should " ; giving the track 8 / 10 . Rolling Stone stated that the single sees Muse " swap bombastic bass brutality with <unk> subtleties as Matthew Bellamy croons over a surprisingly gentle pop track . " Radio Times described it as " George Michael 's Faith underwater " . In a negative review of the song , Robert Myers of The Village Voice wrote that " the band 's U2 imitation has finally caught up to Achtung Baby and Zooropa " . He further added that Muse " gets the surface details right but lacks the emotional and intellectual foundation to get at their inspiration 's essence . " Rolling Stone named the song the 37th best song of 2012 . Chris Martin of Coldplay described the single as " Muse 's best song yet " .

The missile hits the Eiffel Tower and releases the nanomites in it , destroying the tower and some of the surrounding area before Duke manages to hit the kill switch , but in so doing , he is captured and taken to McCullen 's base under the Arctic . 
 The Joes locate the secret base and fly there , as McCullen loads three missiles with <unk> , which are aimed for Beijing , Moscow , and Washington , DC , the world 's three most important cities . He intends to do this to strike fear into the hearts of every man , woman , and child on the planet , after which they will turn to the person with the most power in the world , the President of the United States . After Snake Eyes takes out one missile , Ripcord destroys the remaining two using a stolen M.A.R.S. prototype Night Raven jet , while Scarlett , Breaker , and Snake Eyes infiltrate the base . Snake Eyes duels and prevails over Storm Shadow . Duke learns that the Doctor is Rex Lewis , Ana 's brother , believed to have been killed by a mistimed airstrike during a mission led by Duke ( also the origin of the alienation between Duke and Ana ) . Rex had encountered Doctor <unk> ( Kevin J. O 'Connor ) in the bunker and was seduced by the nanomite technology , taking too long to retrieve the data and getting caught in the bombing , which disfigured him . After freeing Duke , the Baroness is subdued , as the Doctor reveals he has implanted her with nanomites , which has put her under his control for the past four years . Attempting to kill Duke , McCullen ends up being burned , so the Doctor and he flee to an escape vessel . Duke and the Baroness pursue him while the Joes fall back ; when the Doctor activates the base 's self @-@ destruct sequence , which involves ' blowing the ice cap ' to create blocks of ice which then nearly crush the Joes . 
 The Doctor assumes the identity of the Commander , having healed McCullen 's burned face with nanomites , encasing it in silver and naming him " Destro " , which places McCullen under the Commander 's control . They are captured by G.I. Joe soon after . On the supercarrier USS Flagg , the Baroness is placed in protective custody until they can remove the nanomites from her body . Meanwhile , Zartan , having had his physical appearance altered by nanomites , infiltrates the White House during the missile crisis and assumes the identity of the President of the United States of America ( Jonathan Pryce ) , thus completing a part of McCullen 's plan to rule the world .

 = = = G.I. Joe = = = 
 Channing Tatum as Conrad S. Hauser / Duke 
 The lead soldier . Lorenzo di Bonaventura was originally interested in casting Mark Wahlberg , and when the script was rewritten into a G.I. Joe origin story , the studio offered the role to Tatum . Tatum had played a soldier in Stop @-@ Loss , an anti @-@ war film , and originally wanted no part in G.I. Joe , which he felt glorified war . The actor later detailed that he wound up in the film due to a contractual obligation with Paramount , given Tatum signed a three picture deal following Coach Carter . Tatum was a fan of the G.I. Joe franchise growing up , and expressed interest in playing Snake Eyes despite Paramount wanting him for Duke . 
 Marlon Wayans as Wallace A. Weems / Ripcord 
 A pilot with a romantic interest in Scarlett . A fan of the franchise , Wayans was cast on the strength of his performance in Requiem for a Dream . Bonaventura said that the film showed Wayans could be serious as well as funny . 
 Adewale Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje as Hershel Dalton / Heavy Duty 
 An ordnance expert and field commander of the team . Common was offered the role of Heavy Duty 's cousin Roadblock , although Bonaventura previously indicated Heavy Duty was being used in that character 's stead . Stuart Beattie ultimately chose to have Heavy Duty instead of Roadblock . 
 Dennis Quaid as General Clayton M. Abernathy / Hawk 
 The Joes ' commanding officer . Quaid described Hawk as " a cross between Chuck Yeager and Sgt. Rock and maybe a naïve Hugh Hefner " . Quaid 's son convinced him to take on the part , and the filmmakers enjoyed working with him so much , Stuart Beattie wrote " 10 to 15 more scenes " for the character . He filmed all his scenes within the first two months of production . 
 Rachel Nichols as Shana M. O 'Hara / Scarlett 
 Scarlett graduated from college at age 12 and became the team 's intelligence expert . Having left school so early , she does not understand men 's attraction to her . Nichols was the first choice for the role . Nichols had dyed her blonde hair red – Scarlett 's hair color – for her role in Star Trek , which she filmed before G.I. Joe . She burned herself filming an action sequence with Sienna Miller . 
 Ray Park as Snake Eyes 
 A mysterious ninja commando who took a vow of silence , a departure from the character 's traditional difficulty in speaking due to grievous vocal wounds , a close member of the Arashikage ninja clan , and Storm Shadow 's rival . Park specifically practiced wushu for the role , as well as studying the character 's comic book poses . Park was already familiar with the character , but knew very little of the surrounding saga of G.I. Joe versus Cobra , so he read the comics to further understand the character . He was nervous about wearing the mask , which covered his entire head quite tightly , so he requested to practice wearing it at home . He found the full costume , including the visor , very heavy to wear and akin to a rubber band ; he had to put effort into moving in it . 
 Leo Howard as young Snake Eyes 
 Saïd Taghmaoui as Abel <unk> / Breaker 
 The team 's communications specialist and hacker . He is seen chewing gum during the Battle of Paris in an homage to the original character . 
 <unk> <unk> as Courtney A. Krieger / Cover Girl 
 Hawk 's aide @-@ de @-@ camp . <unk> described going from her modeling career to making such a film as " an amazing experience " , but said she was upset about not taking part in any action sequences . 
 Brendan Fraser ( uncredited ) as Sgt. Geoffrey Stone IV / Stone 
 Fraser was reportedly going to play Gung @-@ Ho , but was instead later revealed to be playing Sergeant Stone . According to the director 's commentary on the DVD , Fraser begged director Stephen Sommers to be in the movie , making it his fourth collaboration with Sommers after the The Mummy franchise . 
 = = = Cobra = = = 
 Joseph Gordon @-@ Levitt as Rexford G. " Rex " Lewis / The Doctor / Cobra Commander 
 The Baroness ' brother , a former soldier who was thought to have been killed during a mission led by Duke – instead , he became the disfigured head scientist of Military Armament Research Syndicate ( MARS ) . USA Today reported that Gordon @-@ Levitt would play multiple roles . Gordon @-@ Levitt wore prosthetic makeup under a mask that was redesigned from the comics because the crew found it too reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan . Upon seeing concept art of the character , Gordon @-@ Levitt signed on because ; " I was like , ' I get to be that ? You 're going to make that [ makeup ] in real life and stick it on me ? Cool . Let me do it . ' That 's a once @-@ in @-@ lifetime opportunity . " Gordon @-@ Levitt is a friend of Tatum and they co @-@ starred in Stop @-@ Loss and Havoc . His casting provided extra incentive for Tatum to join the film . Gordon @-@ Levitt described his vocal performance as being " half reminiscent " of Chris Latta 's voice for the 1980s cartoon , but also half his own ideas , because he felt rendering it fully would sound ridiculous . 
 Christopher Eccleston as Laird James McCullen XXIV / Destro 
 A weapons designer and the founder of MARS who is the main villain in the early part of the film . Irish actor David Murray was originally cast as Destro , but was forced to drop out due to visa issues . Murray was later cast as an ancestor of James McCullen in a flashback scene . 
 Sienna Miller as Anastasia DeCobray / Ana Lewis / The Baroness 
 The sister of Cobra Commander and a spy . Years earlier , The Baroness was going to marry Duke , but he left her at the altar , due to his guilt over her brother 's apparent death . Miller auditioned for the part because it did not involve " having a breakdown or addicted to heroin or dying at the end , something that was just maybe really great fun and that people went to see and actually just had a great time seeing . " Miller prepared with four months of weight training , boxing sessions and learned to fire live ammunition , gaining five pounds of muscle . She sprained her wrist after slipping on a rubber bullet while filming a fight scene with Rachel Nichols . 
 Lee Byung @-@ hun as Thomas Arashikage / Storm Shadow 
 Snake Eyes ' rival ; both were close members of the Arashikage ninja clan . Lee was unfamiliar with G.I. Joe because the franchise is unknown in South Korea , but Sommers and Bonaventura told him that it was not necessary to watch the cartoons to prepare for the role . Lee was attracted to Storm Shadow 's " dual personality , " which he stated has " huge pride and honor . " 
 Brandon Soo Hoo as young Storm Shadow 
 Arnold Vosloo as Zartan 
 A disguise expert who serves Destro . 
 Kevin J. O 'Connor as Doctor <unk> 
 A scientist in McCullen 's employ who developed the nanomite technology . After playing Igor in Van Helsing , this is O 'Connor 's fourth collaboration with Stephen Sommers .

 = = = Development = = = 
 In 1994 , Larry <unk> and his production company , Threshold Entertainment , held the rights to do a live @-@ action G.I. Joe film with Warner Bros. as the distributor , but instead chose to concentrate their efforts on their Mortal Kombat films . As late as 1999 , there had been rumors that a film from Threshold Entertainment was still a possibility , but that project never panned out . In 2003 , Lorenzo di Bonaventura was interested in making a film about advanced military technology ; Hasbro 's Brian Goldner called him and suggested to base the film on the G.I. Joe toy line . Goldner and Bonaventura worked together before , creating toy lines for films Bonaventura produced as CEO of Warner Bros. Goldner and Bonaventura spent three months working out a story , and chose Michael B. Gordon as screenwriter , because they liked his script for 300 . Bonaventura wanted to depict the origin story of certain characters , and introduced the new character of Rex , to allow an exploration of Duke . Rex 's name came from Hasbro . Beforehand , Don Murphy was interested in filming the property , but when the Iraq War broke out , he considered the subject matter inappropriate , and chose to develop Transformers ( another Hasbro toy line ) instead . Bonaventura felt , " What [ the Joes ] stand for , and what Duke stands for specifically in the movie , is something that I 'd like to think a worldwide audience might connect with . " 
 By February 2005 , Paul Lovett and David Elliot , who wrote Bonaventura 's Four Brothers , were rewriting Gordon 's draft . In their script , the Rex character is corrupted and mutated into the Cobra Commander , whom Destro needs to lead an army of supersoldiers . Skip Woods was rewriting the script by March 2007 , and he added the Alex Mann character from the British Action Man toy line . Bonaventura explained , " Unfortunately , our president has put us in a position internationally where it would be very difficult to release a movie called G.I. Joe . To add one character to the mix is sort of a fun thing to do . " The script was leaked online by El <unk> of Latino Review , who revealed Woods had dropped the Cobra Organization in favor of the Naja / Ryan , a crooked CIA agent . In this draft , Scarlett is married to Action Man but still has feelings for Duke , and is killed by the Baroness . Snake Eyes speaks , but his vocal cords are slashed during the story , rendering him mute . <unk> suggested Stuart Beattie rewrite the script . Fan response to the film following the script review was negative . Bonaventura promised with subsequent rewrites , " I 'm hoping we 're going to get it right this time . " He admitted he had problems with Cobra , concurring with an interviewer " they were probably the stupidest evil organization out there [ as depicted in the cartoon ] " . Hasbro promised they would write Cobra back into the script . 
 In August 2007 , Paramount Pictures hired Stephen Sommers to direct the film after his presentation to CEO Brad Grey and production <unk> Brad Weston was well received . Sommers had been inspired to explore the G.I. Joe universe after visiting Hasbro 's headquarters in Rhode Island . The project had found the momentum based on the success of Transformers , which Bonaventura produced with Murphy . Sommers partly signed on to direct because the concept reminded him of James Bond , and he described an underwater battle in the story as a tribute to Thunderball . Stuart Beattie was hired to write a new script for Sommers 's film , and G.I. Joe comic and <unk> writer Larry Hama was hired as creative consultant . Hama helped them change story elements that fans would have disliked and made it closer to the comics , ultimately deciding fans would enjoy the script . He persuaded them to drop a comic scene at the film 's end , where Snake Eyes speaks . To speed up production before the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike , John Lee Hancock , Brian Koppelman and David Levien also assisted in writing various scenes . Goldner said their inspiration was generally Hama 's comics and not the cartoon . Sommers said had it not been for the rich backstory in the franchise , the film would have fallen behind schedule because of the strike . 
 After Variety had reported that G.I. Joe became a Brussels @-@ based outfit that stands for Global Integrated Joint Operating Entity , there were reports of outrages over Paramount 's alleged attempt to change the origin of G.I. Joe Team . Hasbro responded in its G.I. Joe site claiming it was not changing what the G.I. Joe brand is about , and the name " G.I. Joe " will always be synonymous with bravery and heroism . Instead , it would be a modern telling of the " G.I. Joe vs. Cobra " storyline , based out of the " Pit " as they were throughout the 1980s comic book series . 
 = = = Filming and design = = = 
 Filming began on February 11 , 2008 , in Los Angeles , California . The Downey soundstage was chosen as Paramount needed a large stage to get production underway as soon as possible . The first two levels of the Pit were built there , to complement the rest of the building which would be done with special effects . Downey also housed Destro 's MARS base in the Arctic , his legitimate weapons factory in an ex @-@ Soviet state , as well as various submarines interiors , including a <unk> ( Submersible High @-@ speed Attack and Reconnaissance Craft ) manned by two G.I. Joes . 
 Filming in the Czech Republic 's Barrandov Studios began in May . The crew took over sections of the Old Town in Prague . While filming in the city on April 26 , people were injured when a bus and several cars collided with a four @-@ wheel @-@ drive vehicle that appeared to have braking problems . The emergency services confirmed those taken to hospital had minor injuries . Filming wrapped after a month in Prague . Additional second unit filming took place in Paris itself , Egypt , Tokyo , the Arctic and underwater . 
 Sommers felt " almost 100 percent " of the technology in the film would be available within 10 to 20 years , citing the various books and magazines about developing weapons that he loved reading . For example , Sommers said he believed invisibility was impossible , but the virtual invisibility provided by camouflage camera that projects what is behind a soldier on their front allowed him to include it . The production designers modelled the interior of Destro 's private submarine on a Handley Page Jetstream . Sommers said the bulky immobile " accelerator suits " ( which Beattie said had enabled them to write " a car chase where one guy 's not even in a car " ) had been tough on the actors and were likely to have their roles reduced in potential sequels . Critics have compared the suits to that of NFL <unk> , a comic book character jointly licensed by the NFL and Marvel Comics , and resembling an armored football player . 
 Bonaventura predicted the United States armed forces ' aid of the film would be limited since much of the hardware is fictional . The filmmakers were denied use of MRAP vehicles at the start of filming as the Defense Department had just prioritised their deployment on combat operations , however they were later permitted to film the vehicles at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin Military Reservation . Some commentators reviewing previews and promotional art from the film have noted superficial resemblances between it and the action film parody Team America : World Police . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 Six visual effects companies worked in The Rise of Cobra , the most prominent being Digital Domain , which handled the Paris action sequences and the opening convoy sequence . For the Eiffel Tower destruction , a special code for depicting how the crumbling metal works was written . To create the digital Eiffel Tower , the technicians had access to the original building plans , and built a digital model so complex that it could not fit in a single file . The nanomites used two proprietary software for their depiction , one by Digital Domain , and another by Prime Focus VFX , which also created tools to generate 3D cloud and sky environments for the aerial scenes . Many scenarios were almost fully developed by computer @-@ generated imagery , such as the landing platform of the Pit , the Cobra ice caverns , and the final underwater battle . As for the sound effects themselves , only one is considered popular and isn 't instantly recognisable . When the pulse cannon fires upon the main submarine during the polar assault , the sound of a program de @-@ resolution from the 1982 cult movie classic TRON can be heard .

 G.I.

A soundtrack album of the score was released by Varèse Sarabande Records on August 4 , 2009 . 
 The score came under scrutiny from various soundtrack forums soon after being released . Spectral analysis of the content of the CD revealed certain frequency cutoff patterns around 16 kHz , which are typical for lossy codecs . By analyzing the block size of these cutoffs , individuals at <unk> were able to identify the lossy codec that was used before mastering the CD as MP3 with a sample rate of 48 kHz . According to the aforementioned forums , Varèse 's German subsidiary Colosseum <unk> acknowledged this as a mastering error , while Varèse Sarabande itself denied this . It is so far unclear if a remastered version with full frequency content will be released .

 Paramount decided to not screen the film for print critics before its release and wanted to focus on internet critics . The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 35 % approval rating with an average rating of 4 @.@ 6 / 10 based on 159 reviews . The website 's consensus reads , " While fans of the Hasbro toy franchise may revel in a bit of nostalgia , G.I. Joe : The Rise of Cobra is largely a cartoonish , over @-@ the @-@ top action fest propelled by silly writing , inconsistent visual effects , and merely passable performances . " Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the film has received an average score of 32 out of 100 , based on 25 reviews . 
 One of the many complaints made by fans was that the film failed to relate to the G.I. Joe franchise . <unk> stated that , " [ the studio ] actually went out of their way to butcher the G.I. Joe mythos in favor of derivative storyline devices . " They cited the Baroness , who was changed from an East European noble in the comics to Duke 's brainwashed ex @-@ girlfriend in the film . 
 Dan Jolin of Empire magazine commented that it was " Bond without the style and Team America without the <unk> " . The Daily Telegraph reviewer said , " The taint of <unk> extends everywhere in this joyless stinker . " James Berardinelli said the characters were " as plastic as the toys that inspired them " and considered Tatum " wooden " and that his character was " more animated in sequences when he is rendered by special effects than when being portrayed by Tatum " . Roger Ebert described that " there is never any clear sense in the action of where anything is in relation to anything else " . Chuck Wilson of The Village Voice criticized the dialogue and described the underwater battle as " absurdly overproduced , momentarily diverting , and then instantly forgettable " . Manohla Dargis of The New York Times considered the plot " at once elemental and incomprehensible " , and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone thought that , despite the high budget , the special effects " look shockingly crappy ; the Eiffel Tower appears to be destroyed by some green slime left over from the Ghostbusters films " . Reviewers also criticized the film for the scientific impossibility of sinking ocean ice . 
 Matthew Leyland from Total Film called it " a throwaway blast of solid , stupid fun " and gave it three out of five stars , particularly praising Joseph Gordon @-@ Levitt 's performance as the treacherous Cobra Commander . Sister publication SFX called the film " dumb and dopey , with plenty of bumpy bits " and that " GI Joe has a genuine cliffhanger charm , especially when the last act becomes a whole string of pulp plot twists .

Christopher Monfette of IGN also gave the film a positive review , saying " This is an adult 's interpretation of a childhood phenomenon , and if you 're willing to give it a shot , one suspects that you 'll find yourself entertained enough to give your best , " Yo , Joe ! " He gave the film three and a half out of five stars .

 = Vardar Offensive = 
 The Vardar Offensive ( Bulgarian : <unk> при <unk> ) was a World War I military operation , fought between 15 and 29 September 1918 . The operation took place during the final stage of the Balkans Campaign . On September 15 , a combined force of Serbian , French and Greek troops attacked the Bulgarian @-@ held trenches in Dobro Pole ( " Good Field " ) , at the time part of the Kingdom of Serbia ( present day Republic of Macedonia ) . The assault and the preceding artillery preparation had devastating effects on Bulgarian morale , eventually leading to mass desertions . 
 On September 18 , a second Entente formation assaulted the Bulgarian positions in the vicinity of Lake Doiran . Effectively employing machine gun and artillery fire the Bulgarians managed to stall the Allied advance on the Doiran sector . However the collapse of the front at Dobro Pole forced the Bulgarians to withdraw from Doiran . The Allies pursued the German 11th Army and the Bulgarian 1st Army , while pushing deeper into Vardar Macedonia . By 29 September , the Allies had captured the former HQ of Uskub , thus endangering the remnants of the 11th Army . 
 The parallel development of the anti @-@ monarchist Radomir Rebellion , forced Bulgaria to sign the Armistice of Salonica and withdraw from the war . The treaty included the full capitulation of the 11th Army , bringing the final tally of German and Bulgarian prisoners to 77 @,@ 000 and granting the Allies 500 artillery pieces . The Bulgarian downfall turned the strategic and operational balance of the war against the Central Powers . The Macedonian Front was brought to an end at noon on 30 September , when the ceasefire came into effect . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 The 28 June 1914 , assassination of Austro @-@ Hungarian heir presumptive Archduke Franz Ferdinand precipitated Austria @-@ Hungary 's declaration of war against Serbia . The conflict quickly attracted the involvement of all major European countries , pitting the Central Powers against the Entente coalition and starting World War I. 
 Serbia was defeated during the autumn 1915 phase of the Serbian Campaign , prompting France and Britain to transfer troops from the Gallipoli Campaign to Greek Macedonia . The Macedonian Front was thus established in an effort to support the remnants of the Serbian army to conquer Vardar Macedonia . 
 On 17 August 1916 , in the Struma Offensive Bulgaria invaded Greece , easily conquering all Greek territory east of the Struma , since the Greek Army was ordered not to resist by the pro @-@ German King Constantine . The surrender of territory recently won with difficulty in the Second Balkan War of 1913 was the last straw for many supporters of Liberal Party politician Eleftherios Venizelos . With Allied assistance , they launched a coup which secured Thessaloniki and most of Greek Macedonia , causing the National Schism . In June 1917 , the Venizelists gained full control of the country , immediately declaring war on the Central Powers and joining the Allied Army of the Orient operating on the Balkan Front . The Greek entry into the war along with the 24 division reinforcements that the Army had received in the spring of the same year had created a strategic advantage for the Entente . 
 On 30 May 1918 , the Allies launched an offensive on the heavily fortified Skra salient , commencing the battle of Skra @-@ di @-@ <unk> . Utilizing the cover of heavy artillery a Franco @-@ Hellenic force made a rapid push into the enemy trenches , conquering Skra and the surrounding system of fortifications . Greek casualties amounted to 434 – 440 killed in action , 154 – 164 missing in action and 1 @,@ 974 – 2 @,@ 220 wounded , France lost approximately 150 men killed or injured . A total of 1 @,@ 782 soldiers of the Central Powers became prisoners of war , including a small number of German engineers and artillery specialists that served in Bulgarian units ; considerable amounts of military equipment also fell into Entente hands . The plan for a Bulgarian counterattack against Skra remained unfulfilled as the Bulgarian soldiers refused to take part in the operation . Both the Greek and the French press used the opportunity to extol the efforts of the Greek army , favorably influencing the Greek mobilization . 
 The fall of Skra prompted Bulgarian prime minister Vasil <unk> to resign on 21 June 1918 . Aleksandar <unk> who assumed office immediately afterwards pursued secret negotiations with Britain , offering Bulgaria 's exit from the war with the condition that Bulgaria fully retains eastern Macedonia . However , British prime minister David Lloyd George rejected the proposal , assuring the Greek ambassador in London Ioannis <unk> , that Britain would not act against Greek interests . 
 In late July 1918 , Bulgarian commander @-@ in @-@ chief Nikola Zhekov sent German Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg a message regarding a rumored Entente offensive , and detailed Bulgaria 's inability to adequately defend the Vardar portion of the front . Zhekov requested that Germany immediately reinforce the Balkan Front , hinting that Austria @-@ Hungary would also be required to strengthen its positions in Albania . On 17 August , Hindenburg pledged to provide Bulgaria with support once the situation on other front permits it . Hindenburg 's reluctance to support Bulgaria was also manifested by the early September redeployment of the last German Jäger battalion stationed in Macedonia back into Germany . 
 The Bulgarians , using information from escaped prisoners of war , determined that Entente forces would engage in hostile actions west of lake Ohrid , in Monastir , Dobro Pole or Human . On 27 August , the 2nd and 3rd Bulgarian Divisions stationed at Dobro Pole were ordered to make emergency preparations , as new evidence indicated a frontal assault on Dobro Pole along with a secondary attack on Human . By 7 September , Dobro Pole was reinforced by one machine gun company , six battalions and ten heavy howitzers , the head of Army Group Scholtz General Friedrich von Scholtz then stated that the defensive measures made the defense of the front feasible . Scholtz had failed to take into account the departure of Bulgarian chief of staff Nikola Zhekov and his subsequent replacement by Georgi Todorov . Widespread insubordination and desertions also plagued the Bulgarian troops who refused to participate in fortification works ; poor rations and fatigue contributed to the low morale . 
 A day prior to the Entente offensive , General Louis Franchet d 'Espèrey laid out the final plan for the operation . The first phase consisted of a combined Franco @-@ Serbian attack on the positions of the 2nd and 3rd Bulgarian Divisions , which was expected to create a breach of the front line in the area of Dobro Pole , while also posing a danger to the Bulgarian supply lines on river Vardar . Τhe 1 @,@ 875 metres ( 6 @,@ 152 ft ) Dobro Pole ( " Good Field " ) peak dominated the region , providing excellent observation points for the defenders . Dobro Pole was surrounded by a well @-@ developed system of trenches which , in combination with the rough terrain , made the area impassable for wheeled transport . Dobro Pole was , however , lower and less steep than the mountains on other parts of the front that averaged 2 @,@ 000 metres ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) . 
 A second Anglo @-@ Franco @-@ Hellenic force would then attack the Bulgarian 1st Army between the Vardar river and Lake Doiran , preventing it from forming new defensive positions in the area . The initial advance would allow the Armée d 'Orient to progress in support of other units first to Prilep , <unk> and <unk> . In the meantime , an Anglo @-@ Hellenic force would strike Mount Belasica , occupying the Rupel Pass . The Doiran sector had previously been subject to two major Entente offensives known as the First Battle of Doiran ( August 1916 ) and Second Battle of Doiran ( April – May 1917 ) . Both engagements ended in decisive Bulgarian victories , forcing the Allies to limit their operations to small raids and harassing fire . Between 1916 and July 1918 , Bulgarian defenses around Doiran underwent a period of considerable reorganization under the personal supervision of General Vladimir Vazov . The sector was divided into two 14 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 7 mi ) defensive areas , protected by the Mountain Division and the 9th Infantry Division respectively . Bulgaria established combat security outposts at a distance of 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) from the enemy trenches , while also reinforcing the defenses of the dominant Dub and Kala Tepe mountains . Similarly to Dobro Pole the defenses consisted of a series of mutually supporting trenches , with built in observation posts , machine gun positions and artillery pieces . 
 D 'Espèrey expected to march the Allied Army of the Orient through the towns of Demir Hisar , Rupel , <unk> , <unk> , Gradec , Štip and <unk> finally seizing Skopje . Units stationed at <unk> and Tetovo would prevent a Bulgarian flanking maneuver , while the main body of the force would widen the breach both in Štip and Prilep . In case of a collapse of the front between Dobro Pole and <unk> , the Bulgarian 1st Army and the German 11th Army . Armies would either be annihilated or , in less favorable circumstances , perform an organised retreat to a new defensive line on river Crna . The prevention of such a retreat was to be achieved by a rapid , penetrating attack on <unk> , <unk> Planina and <unk> .

 At 8 a.m. on 14 September 1918 , Entente forces commenced a 566 @-@ gun artillery barrage on enemy positions . Their aircraft also bombed enemy positions and strafed a 250 @-@ truck column moving towards Kozjak . On the same day , Scholtz sent Hindenburg a telegraph stating that 
 ... all indications point out that an enemy offensive will target the 11th Army on both sides of Vardar as well as Dobro Pole .... 
 The Bulgarian high command did not attempt to perform a spoiling attack as they lacked the necessary vehicles and pack animals . The barrage did not cause a significant number of casualties but severely affected the Bulgarian esprit de corps . On the night between 14 and 15 September , Franco @-@ Serbian patrols reported that the artillery barrage had dealt sufficient damage to the barbed wire entanglements separating the trenches . 
 At 5 : 30 a.m. on 15 September , the French 122nd and 17th ( Colonial ) Divisions struck Sokol , Dobro Pole , Kravitski Kamene and Kravitsa while the Serbian Shumadia Division assaulted Kamene and Veternik . The Greek Archipelago Division , 3rd Division and 4th Division under Panagiotis <unk> acted as a link between the Serbian and French troops without entering combat . The offensive immediately caused a wave of mass desertion among the Bulgarian units ; the remaining infantrymen and artillery squadrons were not able to hold their ground . During the course of the battle , the 122nd Division broke into two columns and suffered heavy casualties . The left column managed to reach a position located 50 metres ( 160 ft ) from Sokol at 6 : 30 a.m. and take the peak at the end of the day . At 16 : 00 p.m. , the right column captured Dobro Pole after rushing a 200 metres ( 660 ft ) segment of steep terrain . The 17th Division seized Kravitsa at 7 : 00 a.m. , suppressing the last signs of resistance . 
 Two Franco @-@ Greek Regiments attempted to storm Zborsko but were pushed back in the ensuing counterattack , as powerful pockets of resistance between the Sousnitsa and <unk> streams facilitated its defense . Greek units then focused on Sousnitsa the fall of which created an opening in the Bulgarian rear and put the surrounding units to flight . Using dispersed bluffs as cover , soldiers of the Shumadia Division took over Veternik , Kamene and the western part of a nearby mountain range with considerable difficulty . Elements of the same unit successfully flanked Kravitski Kamene while the 17th Division was engaging in a frontal assault . At 16 : 00 p.m. , the Serbian 1st Army 's thrust on Sokol failed to produce intended results . An attack later that night did secure the peak . The two French divisions were then ordered to remain in position while the Serbian Timok and Yugoslav Divisions moved forward . By the end of the day , Bulgaria lost approximately 40 – 50 percent of the 12 @,@ 000 soldiers involved in the battle , including 3 @,@ 000 prisoners of war , 2 @,@ 689 dead and 50 out of the initial 158 artillery pieces . Entente casualties amounted to 1 @,@ 700 Frenchmen and 200 Serbians killed in action . 
 On the morning of 16 September , the Serbians overran the Kozjak mountain range and the Golo Bilo peak . They were joined by the 35th Greek Regiment which crossed the Poroi river and later marching on Topolets . At 11 : 00 a.m. , Franco @-@ Hellenic units stormed Zborsko for a second time and were met by heavy artillery and machine gun fire . The attack was rebuffed with the loss of 158 Greeks and roughly the same number of French lives and attempts to take the area were suspended . Živojin Mišić 's 1st Army and the Armée d 'Orient performed a night attack on the Gradešnica fortified zone , suppressing the defenders . The 1st Division Group moved into a position on the Poroi river north of <unk> in conjunction with the Timok Division . By the night of 16 September , the gap in what formerly constituted the front @-@ line had extended to 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) in width and 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) in depth . The Allied command ordered its air department to continue attacking all bridges on the river Vardar . 
 At 4 @.@ 00 a.m. on 17 September , Hellenic components of the 1st Division Group raided mount Preslap , a key position housing Bulgarian artillery . The Greeks rapidly descended from Golo Bilo and then began climbing the cliffs of Preslap with their bare hands . The Preslap garrison proceeded to abandon their positions and retreat eastwards . Having lost their artillery cover forces at Zborsko followed their comrades in retreat . The Timok Division conquered Topolets and advanced towards Studena Voda and Preslap while the Morava and Yugoslav Divisions overran <unk> Kamene . At the same time , the Drina and Danube Divisions seized Gradešnica along with the <unk> and <unk> peaks , then halted at <unk> . 
 On 18 September , the 11th French Colonial Division and the 6th Greek Regiment occupied the villages of <unk> , <unk> and Cebren , approaching towards the Cebren Monastery bridge on Crna . An Entente air raid destroyed another bridge north of <unk> Bey . Bulgarian forces failed at putting a stop to the Allied offensive , abandoning their wounded and large quantities of military equipment . By the end of the day , Allied troops had advanced 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) into enemy territory while also seizing locales of strategic importance that would later enable them to continue pushing deeper into Vardar Macedonia . 
 = = = Battle of Doiran = = = 
 On 16 September , the Allies commenced a 232 gun and 24 howitzer artillery barrage on the Bulgarian positions between Vardar and Doiran . Bulgaria responded in kind , with the artillery duel continuing during the following two days . On the night of 17 – 18 September , Bulgarian positions were targeted by nine salvos of gas shells , however the attack failed to produce any considerable effect due to the preceding arrival of new gas masks and the adequate training of the defenders . 
 At 5 @.@ 00 a.m. on 18 September , the British XII Corps executed a pincer maneuver on the 9th Bulgarian Division , while the Greek Serres Division and the 83rd British Brigade assaulted the Bulgarian trenches to the west , taking numerous prisoners . On the north – east direction the Crete Division and the 28th British Division advanced between the lake and Belasica , after clearing out the Bulgarian outpost line . The 26th British Division seized a number of Bulgarian security outposts but was quickly repulsed by heavy artillery fire and counter @-@ attacks that recaptured the lost ground . It was not until 7 : 20 a.m. , when the Serres Division managed to make limited gains on the flanks having suffered numerous casualties and lost momentum . In the meantime the 22nd British Division overtook two central <unk> . Supported by concentrated artillery and machine gun fire the 3rd Bulgarian Brigade pushed the Allies back , by the end of the day the sum of the Entente forces were back at their starting point , the British 67th Brigade having lost 65 percent of its soldiers . 
 The offensive was resumed at 4 @.@ 00 a.m. on 19 September after a night of heavy shelling . The operation involved the British 77th and 65th Brigades , the 2nd French Zouaves Regiment , along with the Serres and 14th Greek Divisions . Following five hours of intense fighting the Allies managed to overrun the town of <unk> , mount Kala Tepe and Teton Hill , with the Pip Ridge and mount Dub remaining in Bulgarian hands . In the aftermath of the engagement the Allied command found itself to be unable to make any further offensive operations on the Doiran sector as it no longer possessed an adequate reserve of manpower . Bulgaria lost a total of 518 dead , 998 wounded , and 1 @,@ 210 captured . Greek casualties amounted to 503 killed , 2 @,@ 286 injured and 615 missing , with the British suffering 3 @,@ 871 dead and wounded . 
 = = = Subsequent operations = = = 
 On 20 September , the 17th and 122nd French Colonial Divisions along with the 1st Serbian Army crossed river Crna . News of a breakthrough at Dobro Pole prompted the defenders of Doiran to abandon their positions and rush to the defense of their homeland , in order to prevent a future occupation by the Entente . On 21 September , the Allies became aware of the Bulgarian withdrawal after observing a series of fires and munition dump explosions on the Bulgarian positions , a pursuit by the British XII Corps was launched immediately . The Serbian advanced guard approached <unk> , thus creating a wedge between the 1st Bulgarian and 11th German Armies in an effort to force the latter to retire towards Albania . The 2nd Bulgarian Army headed towards the <unk> Pass avoiding direct engagement with the Allies . 
 At 17 : 30 p.m. on 22 September , the Italian 35th Division under General Ernesto <unk> joined the offensive , seizing Hill 1050 stronghold from the 302nd German Division and taking 150 prisoners . Fighting took place in <unk> and along the Monastir – Prilep road , in <unk> , <unk> and <unk> as the Allies continued to advance towards Prilep . At 14 : 00 p.m. on 23 September , General Louis Franchet d 'Espèrey announced that the initial plan of the operation was to be modified . The Italians were ordered to strike Kičevo with the aim of preventing the enemy forces stationed at Monastir from reaching the railroad hub in Uskub , the 11th Colonial French Division was instead tasked with securing Prilep . Half an hour later the French entered Prilep , to the east Franco – Serbian columns marched on Štip , Veles , Brod and through the <unk> mountain range . 
 On 24 September , Bulgarian infantry supported by artillery halted the advance of the Italian cavalry between Kruševo and the <unk> bridge . At 17 : 00 p.m. , an Italo – Serbian assault resulted in the fall of <unk> . On 25 September , the Sicilia Brigade captured Kruševo and the surrounding peaks after being reinforced by the 11th Colonial French Division . The Quadruple Alliance High Command set Uskub as the rallying point for its forces in Vardar Macedonia , intending to later strengthen them with units from Germany and Austria . The 30th and 156th French Divisions occupied <unk> and Drvenik respectively . On 25 September , a band of Bulgarian deserters who had previously fled from Dobro Pole arrived at Kyustendil , looting the city and putting the Bulgarian High Command to flight . The mass of retreating Bulgarian mutineers then converged on the railway center of Radomir in Bulgaria , just 30 miles ( 48 km ) from the capital city of Sofia . On the evening of 26 September , Italian cavalry wrestled <unk> from a Saxon infantry unit , later entering <unk> where it received information of a Bulgarian withdrawal from Veles . On 27 September , the leaders of the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union took control of these troops and proclaimed the establishment of the Bulgarian Republic . About 4 @,@ 000 – 5 @,@ 000 rebellious troops threatened Sofia the following day , in what came to be known the Radomir Rebellion . 
 The Serbian Second Army having previously taken Štip , entered Veles , <unk> and <unk> . Uskub was protected by a garrison of six and a half battalions , four armored trains and four artillery batteries split between a mountain range south of the city and a position north of lake Kaplan . Between 27 – 28 September , the 1st and 4th French Colonial Regiments made their way through <unk> and <unk> , successfully bypassing any sentries located in the 20 @-@ kilometre ( 12 mi ) gap between the two Bulgarian formations that protected Uskub . At 4 : 00 a.m. on 29 September , French General <unk> @-@ Gambetta laid out the plan for the final stage of the offensive , the attack on Uskub . The assault was launched an hour later , French <unk> utilized thick fog to advance on mount <unk> , however they were forced to regroup after facing heavy resistance . A pincer movement by the 1st Colonial Regiment created a bridgehead at river Vardar , while the 4th Colonial Regiment seized <unk> village . At 9 : 00 a.m. , the <unk> overtook <unk> , later shifting their attention towards the <unk> road . The 1st Colonial Regiment joined the <unk> , opening machine gun fire on the retreating 61st German Corps and causing numerous casualties . At 11 : 00 a.m. , the French entered Uskub , detaining 220 Bulgarian and 139 German soldiers , while also seizing 5 guns and large amounts of ordnance . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Under those chaotic circumstances a Bulgarian delegation arrived in Thessaloniki to ask for an armistice . On 29 September , the Bulgarians were granted the Armistice of Salonica by General d 'Esperey . The Bulgarian downfall turned the strategic and operational balance of the war against the Central Powers . The Macedonian Front was brought to an end at noon on 30 September , when the ceasefire came into effect . The treaty included the full capitulation of the 11th German Army , bringing the final tally of German and Bulgarian prisoners to 77 @,@ 000 and granting the Allies 500 artillery pieces . The Radomir Rebellion was put down , by Bulgarian forces , as of the 2 October , while Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria abdicated and went into exile the following day . 
 The British Army headed east towards the European side of the Ottoman Empire , while the French and Serbian forces continued north . The British Army neared Constantinople and , without a force capable to stopping the advance , the Ottoman government asked for an armistice ( the Armistice of Mudros ) on 26 October . In Serbia , " Desperate Frankie " ( as the British nicknamed d 'Esperey ) continued to advance and the Serbo @-@ French Army re @-@ captured the country , overrunning several weak German divisions that tried to block its push near Niš . On 3 November , Austria @-@ Hungary was forced to sign an armistice on the Italian Front ending the war there . On 10 November , d 'Esperey 's army crossed the Danube river and was poised to enter the Hungarian heartland . At the request of the French general , Count Mihály Károlyi , leading the Hungarian government , came to Belgrade and signed another armistice . 
 = Monarchy of the United Kingdom = 
 The monarchy of the United Kingdom , commonly referred to as the British monarchy , is the constitutional monarchy of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories . The monarch 's title is " King " ( male ) or " Queen " ( female ) . The current monarch and head of state , Queen Elizabeth II , ascended the throne on the death of her father , King George VI , on 6 February 1952 . 
 The monarch and his or her immediate family undertake various official , ceremonial , diplomatic and representational duties . As the monarchy is constitutional , the monarch is limited to non @-@ partisan functions such as bestowing honours and appointing the Prime Minister . The monarch is , by tradition , commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the British Armed Forces . Though the ultimate formal executive authority over the government of the United Kingdom is still by and through the monarch 's royal prerogative , these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and , in practice , within the constraints of convention and precedent . 
 The British monarchy traces its origins from the petty kingdoms of early medieval Scotland and Anglo @-@ Saxon England , which consolidated into the kingdoms of England and Scotland by the 10th century AD . In 1066 , the last crowned Anglo @-@ Saxon monarch , Harold II , was defeated and killed during the Norman conquest of England and the English monarchy passed to the Normans ' victorious leader , William the Conqueror , and his descendants . 
 In the 13th century , Wales , as a principality , became a client state of the English kingdom , while Magna Carta began a process of reducing the English monarch 's political powers . 
 From 1603 , when the Scottish monarch King James VI inherited the English throne as James I , both the English and Scottish kingdoms were ruled by a single sovereign . From 1649 to 1660 , the tradition of monarchy was broken by the republican Commonwealth of England , which followed the Wars of the Three Kingdoms . The Act of Settlement 1701 , which is still in force , excluded Roman Catholics , or those who marry Catholics , from succession to the English throne . In 1707 , the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to create the Kingdom of Great Britain , and in 1801 , the Kingdom of Ireland joined to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . The British monarch became nominal head of the vast British Empire , which covered a quarter of the world 's surface at its greatest extent in 1921 . 
 In the 1920s , five @-@ sixths of Ireland seceded from the Union as the Irish Free State , and the Balfour Declaration recognised the evolution of the dominions of the empire into separate , self @-@ governing countries within a Commonwealth of Nations . After the Second World War , the vast majority of British colonies and territories became independent , effectively bringing the empire to an end . George VI and his successor , Elizabeth II , adopted the title Head of the Commonwealth as a symbol of the free association of its independent member states . 
 The United Kingdom and fifteen other Commonwealth monarchies that share the same person as their monarch are called Commonwealth realms . The terms British monarchy and British monarch are frequently still employed in reference to the shared individual and institution ; however , each country is sovereign and independent of the others , and the monarch has a different , specific , and official national title and style for each realm . 
 = = Constitutional role = = 
 In the uncodified Constitution of the United Kingdom , the Monarch ( otherwise referred to as the Sovereign or " His / Her Majesty " , abbreviated H.M. ) is the Head of State . Oaths of allegiance are made to the Queen and her lawful successors . God Save the Queen ( or God Save the King ) is the British national anthem , and the monarch appears on postage stamps , coins and banknotes . 
 The Monarch takes little direct part in Government . The decisions to exercise sovereign powers are delegated from the Monarch , either by statute or by convention , to Ministers or officers of the Crown , or other public bodies , exclusive of the Monarch personally . Thus the acts of state done in the name of the Crown , such as Crown Appointments , even if personally performed by the Monarch , such as the Queen 's Speech and the State Opening of Parliament , depend upon decisions made elsewhere : 
 Legislative power is exercised by the Queen @-@ in @-@ Parliament , by and with the advice and consent of Parliament , the House of Lords and the House of Commons . 
 Executive power is exercised by Her Majesty 's Government , which comprises Ministers , primarily the Prime Minister and the Cabinet , which is technically a committee of the Privy Council . They have the direction of the Armed Forces of the Crown , the Civil Service and other Crown Servants such as the Diplomatic and Secret Services ( the Queen receives certain foreign intelligence reports before the Prime Minister does ) . 
 Judicial power is vested in the Judiciary , who by constitution and statute have judicial independence of the Government . 
 The Church of England , of which the Monarch is the head , has its own legislative , judicial and executive structures . 
 Powers independent of government are legally granted to other public bodies by statute or Statutory Instrument such as an Order in Council , Royal Commission or otherwise . 
 The Sovereign 's role as a constitutional monarch is largely limited to non @-@ partisan functions , such as granting honours . This role has been recognised since the 19th century . The constitutional writer Walter Bagehot identified the monarchy in 1867 as the " dignified part " rather than the " efficient part " of government . 
 = = = Appointment of the Prime Minister = = = 
 Whenever necessary , the Monarch is responsible for appointing a new Prime Minister ( who by convention appoints and may dismiss every other Minister of the Crown , and thereby constitutes and controls the government ) . In accordance with unwritten constitutional conventions , the Sovereign must appoint an individual who commands the support of the House of Commons , usually the leader of the party or coalition that has a majority in that House . The Prime Minister takes office by attending the Monarch in private audience , and after " kissing hands " that appointment is immediately effective without any other formality or instrument . 
 In a hung parliament where no party or coalition holds a majority , the monarch has an increased degree of latitude in choosing the individual likely to command the most support , though it would usually be the leader of the largest party . Since 1945 , there have only been two hung parliaments . The first followed the February 1974 general election when Harold Wilson was appointed Prime Minister after Edward Heath resigned following his failure to form a coalition . Although Wilson 's Labour Party did not have a majority , they were the largest party . The second followed the May 2010 general election , in which the Conservatives ( the largest party ) and Liberal Democrats ( the third largest party ) agreed to form the first coalition government since World War II . 
 = = = Dissolution of Parliament = = = 
 In 1950 the King 's Private Secretary writing pseudonymously to The Times newspaper asserted a constitutional convention : according to the Lascelles Principles , if a minority government asked to dissolve Parliament to call an early election to strengthen its position , the monarch could refuse , and would do so under three conditions . When Prime Minister Wilson requested a dissolution late in 1974 , the Queen granted his request as Heath had already failed to form a coalition . The resulting general election gave Wilson a small majority . The monarch could in theory unilaterally dismiss a Prime Minister , but a Prime Minister 's term now comes to an end only by electoral defeat , death , or resignation . The last monarch to remove a Prime Minister was William IV , who dismissed Lord Melbourne in 1834 . The Fixed @-@ term Parliaments Act 2011 removed the monarch 's authority to dissolve Parliament ; the Act specifically retained the monarch 's power of prorogation however , which is a regular feature of the parliamentary calendar . 
 = = = Royal Prerogative = = = 
 Some of the government 's executive authority is theoretically and nominally vested in the Sovereign and is known as the royal prerogative . The monarch acts within the constraints of convention and precedent , exercising prerogative only on the advice of ministers responsible to Parliament , often through the Prime Minister or Privy Council . In practice , prerogative powers are exercised only on the Prime Minister 's advice – the Prime Minister , and not the Sovereign , has control . The monarch holds a weekly audience with the Prime Minister . No records of these audiences are taken and the proceedings remain fully confidential . The monarch may express his or her views , but , as a constitutional ruler , must ultimately accept the decisions of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet ( providing they command the support of the House ) . In Bagehot 's words : " the Sovereign has , under a constitutional monarchy ... three rights – the right to be consulted , the right to encourage , the right to warn . " 
 Although the Royal Prerogative is extensive and parliamentary approval is not formally required for its exercise , it is limited . Many Crown prerogatives have fallen out of use or have been permanently transferred to Parliament . For example , the monarch cannot impose and collect new taxes ; such an action requires the authorisation of an Act of Parliament . According to a parliamentary report , " The Crown cannot invent new prerogative powers " , and Parliament can override any prerogative power by passing legislation . 
 The Royal Prerogative includes the powers to appoint and dismiss ministers , regulate the civil service , issue passports , declare war , make peace , direct the actions of the military , and negotiate and ratify treaties , alliances , and international agreements . However , a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of the United Kingdom ; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases . The monarch is commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Armed Forces ( the Royal Navy , the British Army , and the Royal Air Force ) , <unk> British High Commissioners and ambassadors , and receives diplomats from foreign states . 
 It is the prerogative of the monarch to summon and prorogue Parliament . Each parliamentary session begins with the monarch 's summons . The new parliamentary session is marked by the State Opening of Parliament , during which the Sovereign reads the Speech from the throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords , outlining the Government 's legislative agenda . <unk> usually occurs about one year after a session begins , and formally concludes the session . Dissolution ends a parliamentary term , and is followed by a general election for all seats in the House of Commons . A general election is normally held five years after the previous one under the Fixed @-@ term Parliaments Act 2011 , but can be held sooner if the Prime Minister loses a motion of confidence , or if two @-@ thirds of the members of the House of Commons vote to hold an early election . 
 Before a bill passed by the legislative Houses can become law , the royal assent ( the monarch 's approval ) is required . In theory , assent can either be granted ( making the bill law ) or withheld ( vetoing the bill ) , but since 1707 assent has always been granted . 
 The monarch has a similar relationship with the devolved governments of Scotland , Wales , and Northern Ireland . The Sovereign appoints the First Minister of Scotland on the nomination of the Scottish Parliament , and the First Minister of Wales on the nomination of the National Assembly for Wales . In Scottish matters , the Sovereign acts on the advice of the Scottish Government . However , as devolution is more limited in Wales , in Welsh matters the Sovereign acts on the advice of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of the United Kingdom . The Sovereign can veto any law passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly , if it is deemed unconstitutional by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland . 
 The Sovereign is deemed the " fount of justice " ; although the Sovereign does not personally rule in judicial cases , judicial functions are performed in his or her name . For instance , prosecutions are brought on the monarch 's behalf , and courts derive their authority from the Crown . The common law holds that the Sovereign " can do no wrong " ; the monarch cannot be prosecuted for criminal offences . The Crown Proceedings Act 1947 allows civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity ( that is , lawsuits against the government ) , but not lawsuits against the monarch personally . The Sovereign exercises the " prerogative of mercy " , which is used to pardon convicted offenders or reduce sentences . 
 The monarch is the " fount of honour " , the source of all honours and dignities in the United Kingdom . The Crown creates all peerages , appoints members of the orders of chivalry , grants knighthoods and awards other honours . Although peerages and most other honours are granted on the advice of the Prime Minister , some honours are within the personal gift of the Sovereign , and are not granted on ministerial advice . The monarch alone appoints members of the Order of the Garter , the Order of the Thistle , the Royal Victorian Order and the Order of Merit . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = English monarchy = = = 
 Following Viking raids and settlement in the ninth century , the Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdom of Wessex emerged as the dominant English kingdom . Alfred the Great secured Wessex , achieved dominance over western Mercia , and assumed the title " King of the English " . His grandson Æthelstan was the first king to rule over a unitary kingdom roughly corresponding to the present borders of England , though its constituent parts retained strong regional identities . The 11th century saw England become more stable , despite a number of wars with the Danes , which resulted in a Danish monarchy for one generation . William , Duke of Normandy 's conquest of England in 1066 was crucial in terms of both political and social change . The new monarch continued the centralisation of power begun in the Anglo @-@ Saxon period , while the Feudal System continued to develop . 
 William I was succeeded by two of his sons : William II , then Henry I. Henry made a controversial decision to name his daughter Matilda ( his only surviving child ) as his heir . Following Henry 's death in 1135 , one of William I 's grandsons , Stephen , laid claim to the throne and took power with the support of most of the barons . Matilda challenged his reign ; as a result , England descended into a period of disorder known as the Anarchy . Stephen maintained a precarious hold on power , but agreed to a compromise under which Matilda 's son Henry would succeed him . Henry accordingly became the first Angevin king of England and the first monarch of the Plantagenet dynasty as Henry II in 1154 . 
 The reigns of most of the Angevin monarchs were marred by civil strife and conflicts between the monarch and the nobility . Henry II faced rebellions from his own sons , the future monarchs Richard I and John . Nevertheless , Henry managed to expand his kingdom , forming what is retrospectively known as the Angevin Empire . Upon Henry 's death , his elder son Richard succeeded to the throne ; he was absent from England for most of his reign , as he left to fight in the Crusades . He was killed besieging a castle , and John succeeded him . 
 John 's reign was marked by conflict with the barons , particularly over the limits of royal power . In 1215 , the barons coerced the king into issuing Magna Carta ( Latin for " Great Charter " ) to guarantee the rights and liberties of the nobility . Soon afterwards , further disagreements plunged England into a civil war known as the First Barons ' War . The war came to an abrupt end after John died in 1216 , leaving the Crown to his nine @-@ year @-@ old son Henry III . Later in Henry 's reign , Simon de Montfort led the barons in another rebellion , beginning the Second Barons ' War . The war ended in a clear royalist victory and in the death of many rebels , but not before the king had agreed to summon a parliament in 1265 . 
 The next monarch , Edward I ( " Edward Longshanks " ) , was far more successful in maintaining royal power and responsible for the conquest of Wales . He attempted to establish English domination of Scotland . However , gains in Scotland were reversed during the reign of his successor , Edward II , who also faced conflict with the nobility . In 1311 , Edward II was forced to relinquish many of his powers to a committee of baronial " <unk> " ; however , military victories helped him regain control in 1322 . Nevertheless , in 1327 , Edward was deposed and then murdered by his wife Isabella . His 14 @-@ year @-@ old son became Edward III . Edward III claimed the French Crown , setting off the Hundred Years ' War between England and France . 
 His campaigns conquered much French territory , but by 1374 , all the gains had been lost . Edward 's reign was also marked by the further development of Parliament , which came to be divided into two Houses . In 1377 , Edward III died , leaving the Crown to his 10 @-@ year @-@ old grandson Richard II . Like many of his predecessors , Richard II conflicted with the nobles by attempting to concentrate power in his own hands . In 1399 , while he was campaigning in Ireland , his cousin Henry Bolingbroke seized power . Richard was deposed , imprisoned , and eventually murdered , probably by starvation , and Henry became king as Henry IV . 
 Henry IV was the grandson of Edward III and the son of John of Gaunt , Duke of Lancaster ; hence , his dynasty was known as the House of Lancaster . For most of his reign , Henry IV was forced to fight off plots and rebellions ; his success was partly due to the military skill of his son , the future Henry V. Henry V 's own reign , which began in 1413 , was largely free from domestic strife , leaving the king free to pursue the Hundred Years ' War in France . Although he was victorious , his sudden death in 1422 left his infant son Henry VI on the throne and gave the French an opportunity to overthrow English rule . 
 The unpopularity of Henry VI 's counsellors and his belligerent consort , Margaret of Anjou , as well as his own ineffectual leadership , led to the weakening of the House of Lancaster . The Lancastrians faced a challenge from the House of York , so called because its head , a descendant of Edward III , was Richard , Duke of York . Although the Duke of York died in battle in 1460 , his eldest son , Edward IV , led the Yorkists to victory in 1461 . The Wars of the Roses , nevertheless , continued intermittently during his reign and those of his son Edward V and brother Richard III . Edward V disappeared , presumably murdered by Richard . Ultimately , the conflict culminated in success for the Lancastrian branch led by Henry Tudor , in 1485 , when Richard III was killed in the Battle of Bosworth Field . 
 Now King Henry VII , he neutralised the remaining Yorkist forces , partly by marrying Elizabeth of York , a Yorkist heir . Through skill and ability , Henry re @-@ established absolute supremacy in the realm , and the conflicts with the nobility that had plagued previous monarchs came to an end . The reign of the second Tudor king , Henry VIII , was one of great political change . Religious upheaval and disputes with the Pope led the monarch to break from the Roman Catholic Church and to establish the Church of England ( the Anglican Church ) . 
 Wales – which had been conquered centuries earlier , but had remained a separate dominion – was annexed to England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Henry VIII 's son and successor , the young Edward VI , continued with further religious reforms , but his early death in 1553 precipitated a succession crisis . He was wary of allowing his Catholic elder half @-@ sister Mary to succeed , and therefore drew up a will designating Lady Jane Grey as his heiress . Jane 's reign , however , lasted only nine days ; with tremendous popular support , Mary deposed her and declared herself the lawful sovereign . Mary I married Philip of Spain , who was declared king and co @-@ ruler , pursued disastrous wars in France , and attempted to return England to Roman Catholicism , burning Protestants at the stake as heretics in the process . Upon her death in 1558 , the pair were succeeded by her Protestant half @-@ sister Elizabeth I. England returned to Protestantism and continued its growth into a major world power by building its navy and exploring the New World . 
 = = = Scottish monarchy = = = 
 In Scotland , as in England , monarchies emerged after the withdrawal of the Roman empire from Britain in the early fifth century . The three groups that lived in Scotland at this time were the Picts in the north east , the Britons in the south , including the Kingdom of Strathclyde , and the Gaels or Scotti ( who would later give their name to Scotland ) , of the Irish petty kingdom of Dál Riata in the west . Kenneth MacAlpin is traditionally viewed as the first king of a united Scotland ( known as Scotia to writers in Latin , or Alba to the Scots ) . The expansion of Scottish dominions continued over the next two centuries , as other territories such as Strathclyde were absorbed . 
 Early Scottish monarchs did not inherit the Crown directly ; instead the custom of <unk> was followed , where the monarchy alternated between different branches of the House of Alpin . As a result , however , the rival dynastic lines clashed , often violently . From 942 to 1005 , seven consecutive monarchs were either murdered or killed in battle . In 1005 , Malcolm II ascended the throne having killed many rivals . He continued to ruthlessly eliminate opposition , and when he died in 1034 he was succeeded by his grandson , Duncan I , instead of a cousin , as had been usual . In 1040 , Duncan suffered defeat in battle at the hands of Macbeth , who was killed himself in 1057 by Duncan 's son Malcolm . The following year , after killing Macbeth 's stepson Lulach , Malcolm ascended the throne as Malcolm III . 
 With a further series of battles and <unk> , five of Malcolm 's sons as well as one of his brothers successively became king . Eventually , the Crown came to his youngest son , David . David was succeeded by his grandsons Malcolm IV , and then by William the Lion , the longest @-@ reigning King of Scots before the Union of the Crowns . William participated in a rebellion against King Henry II of England but when the rebellion failed , William was captured by the English . In exchange for his release , William was forced to acknowledge Henry as his feudal overlord . The English King Richard I agreed to terminate the arrangement in 1189 , in return for a large sum of money needed for the Crusades . William died in 1214 , and was succeeded by his son Alexander II . Alexander II , as well as his successor Alexander III , attempted to take over the Western Isles , which were still under the overlordship of Norway . During the reign of Alexander III , Norway launched an unsuccessful invasion of Scotland ; the ensuing Treaty of Perth recognised Scottish control of the Western Isles and other disputed areas . 
 Alexander III 's unexpected death in a riding accident in 1286 precipitated a major succession crisis . Scottish leaders appealed to King Edward I of England for help in determining who was the rightful heir . Edward chose Alexander 's three @-@ year @-@ old Norwegian granddaughter , Margaret . On her way to Scotland in 1290 , however , Margaret died at sea , and Edward was again asked to adjudicate between 13 rival claimants to the throne . A court was set up and after two years of deliberation , it pronounced John Balliol to be king . However , Edward proceeded to treat Balliol as a vassal , and tried to exert influence over Scotland . In 1295 , when Balliol renounced his allegiance to England , Edward I invaded . During the first ten years of the ensuing Wars of Scottish Independence , Scotland had no monarch , until Robert the Bruce declared himself king in 1306 . 
 Robert 's efforts to control Scotland culminated in success , and Scottish independence was acknowledged in 1328 . However , only one year later , Robert died and was succeeded by his five @-@ year @-@ old son , David II . On the pretext of restoring John Balliol 's rightful heir , Edward Balliol , the English again invaded in 1332 . During the next four years , Balliol was crowned , deposed , restored , deposed , restored , and deposed until he eventually settled in England , and David remained king for the next 35 years . 
 David II died childless in 1371 and was succeeded by his nephew Robert II of the House of Stuart . The reigns of both Robert II and his successor , Robert III , were marked by a general decline in royal power . When Robert III died in 1406 , regents had to rule the country ; the monarch , Robert III 's son James I , had been taken captive by the English . Having paid a large ransom , James returned to Scotland in 1424 ; to restore his authority , he used ruthless measures , including the execution of several of his enemies . He was assassinated by a group of nobles . James II continued his father 's policies by subduing influential noblemen but he was killed in an accident at the age of thirty , and a council of regents again assumed power . James III was defeated in a battle against rebellious Scottish earls in 1488 , leading to another boy @-@ king : James IV . 
 In 1513 James IV launched an invasion of England , attempting to take advantage of the absence of the English King Henry VIII . His forces met with disaster at Flodden Field ; the King , many senior noblemen , and hundreds of soldiers were killed . As his son and successor , James V , was an infant , the government was again taken over by regents . James V led another disastrous war with the English in 1542 , and his death in the same year left the Crown in the hands of his six @-@ day @-@ old daughter , Mary . Once again , a regency was established . 
 Mary , a Roman Catholic , reigned during a period of great religious upheaval in Scotland . As a result of the efforts of reformers such as John Knox , a Protestant ascendancy was established . Mary caused alarm by marrying her Catholic cousin , Lord Darnley , in 1565 . After Lord Darnley 's assassination in 1567 , Mary contracted an even more unpopular marriage with the Earl of Bothwell , who was widely suspected of Darnley 's murder . The nobility rebelled against the Queen , forcing her to abdicate . She fled to England , and the Crown went to her infant son James VI , who was brought up as a Protestant . Mary was imprisoned and later executed by the English Queen Elizabeth I. 
 = = = Personal union and republican phase = = = 
 Elizabeth 's death in 1603 ended Tudor rule in England . Since she had no children , she was succeeded by the Scottish monarch James VI , who was the great @-@ grandson of Henry VIII 's older sister and hence Elizabeth 's first cousin twice removed . James VI ruled in England as James I after what was known as the " Union of the Crowns " . Although England and Scotland were in personal union under one monarch – James I became the first monarch to style himself " King of Great Britain and Ireland " in 1604 – they remained separate kingdoms . James I 's successor , Charles I , experienced frequent conflicts with the English Parliament related to the issue of royal and parliamentary powers , especially the power to impose taxes . He provoked opposition by ruling without Parliament from 1629 to 1640 , unilaterally levying taxes and adopting controversial religious policies ( many of which were offensive to the Scottish Presbyterians and the English Puritans ) . His attempt to enforce Anglicanism led to organised rebellion in Scotland ( the " Bishops ' Wars " ) and ignited the Wars of the Three Kingdoms . In 1642 , the conflict between the King and English Parliament reached its climax and the English Civil War began . 
 The Civil War culminated in the execution of the king in 1649 , the overthrow of the English monarchy , and the establishment of the Commonwealth of England . Charles I 's son , Charles II , was proclaimed King of Great Britain in Scotland , but he was forced to flee abroad after he invaded England and was defeated at the Battle of Worcester . In 1653 , Oliver Cromwell , the most prominent military and political leader in the nation , seized power and declared himself Lord Protector ( effectively becoming a military dictator , but refusing the title of king ) . Cromwell ruled until his death in 1658 , when he was succeeded by his son Richard . The new Lord Protector had little interest in governing ; he soon resigned . The lack of clear leadership led to civil and military unrest , and for a popular desire to restore the monarchy . In 1660 , the monarchy was restored and Charles II returned to Britain . 
 Charles II 's reign was marked by the development of the first modern political parties in England . Charles had no legitimate children , and was due to be succeeded by his Roman Catholic brother , James , Duke of York . A parliamentary effort to exclude James from the line of succession arose ; the " Petitioners " , who supported exclusion , became the Whig Party , whereas the " Abhorrers " , who opposed exclusion , became the Tory Party . The Exclusion Bill failed ; on several occasions , Charles II dissolved Parliament because he feared that the bill might pass . After the dissolution of the Parliament of 1681 , Charles ruled without a Parliament until his death in 1685 . When James succeeded Charles , he pursued a policy of offering religious tolerance to Roman Catholics , thereby drawing the ire of many of his Protestant subjects . Many opposed James 's decisions to maintain a large standing army , to appoint Roman Catholics to high political and military offices , and to imprison Church of England clerics who challenged his policies . As a result , a group of Protestants known as the Immortal Seven invited James II 's daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange to depose the king . William obliged , arriving in England on 5 November 1688 to great public support . Faced with the defection of many of his Protestant officials , James fled the realm and William and Mary ( rather than James II 's Catholic son ) were declared joint Sovereigns of England , Scotland and Ireland . 
 James 's overthrow , known as the Glorious Revolution , was one of the most important events in the long evolution of parliamentary power . The Bill of Rights 1689 affirmed parliamentary supremacy , and declared that the English people held certain rights , including the freedom from taxes imposed without parliamentary consent . The Bill of Rights required future monarchs to be Protestants , and provided that , after any children of William and Mary , Mary 's sister Anne would inherit the Crown . Mary died childless in 1694 , leaving William as the sole monarch . By 1700 , a political crisis arose , as all of Anne 's children had died , leaving her as the only individual left in the line of succession . Parliament was afraid that the former James II or his supporters , known as Jacobites , might attempt to reclaim the throne . Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701 , which excluded James and his Catholic relations from the succession and made William 's nearest Protestant relations , the family of Sophia , Electress of Hanover , next in line to the throne after his sister @-@ in @-@ law Anne . Soon after the passage of the Act , William III died , leaving the Crown to Anne . 
 = = = After the 1707 Acts of Union = = = 
 After Anne 's accession , the problem of the succession re @-@ emerged . The Scottish Parliament , infuriated that the English Parliament did not consult them on the choice of Sophia 's family as the next heirs , passed the Act of Security 1704 , threatening to end the personal union between England and Scotland . The Parliament of England retaliated with the Alien Act 1705 , threatening to devastate the Scottish economy by restricting trade . The Scottish and English parliaments negotiated the Acts of Union 1707 , under which England and Scotland were united into a single Kingdom of Great Britain , with succession under the rules prescribed by the Act of Settlement . 
 In 1714 , Queen Anne was succeeded by her second cousin , and Sophia 's son , George I , Elector of Hanover , who consolidated his position by defeating Jacobite rebellions in 1715 and 1719 . The new monarch was less active in government than many of his British predecessors , but retained control over his German kingdoms , with which Britain was now in personal union . Power shifted towards George 's ministers , especially to Sir Robert Walpole , who is often considered the first British prime minister , although the title was not then in use . The next monarch , George II , witnessed the final end of the Jacobite threat in 1746 , when the Catholic Stuarts were completely defeated . During the long reign of his grandson , George III , Britain 's American colonies were lost , the former colonies having formed the United States of America , but British influence elsewhere in the world continued to grow , and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was created by the Acts of Union 1800 . 
 From 1811 to 1820 , George III suffered a severe bout of what is now believed to be porphyria , an illness rendering him incapable of ruling . His son , the future George IV , ruled in his stead as Prince Regent . During the Regency and his own reign , the power of the monarchy declined , and by the time of his successor , William IV , the monarch was no longer able to effectively interfere with parliamentary power . In 1834 , William dismissed the Whig Prime Minister , William Lamb , 2nd Viscount Melbourne , and appointed a Tory , Sir Robert Peel . In the ensuing elections , however , Peel lost . The king had no choice but to recall Lord Melbourne . During William IV 's reign , the Reform Act 1832 , which reformed parliamentary representation , was passed . Together with others passed later in the century , the Act led to an expansion of the electoral franchise and the rise of the House of Commons as the most important branch of Parliament . 
 The final transition to a constitutional monarchy was made during the long reign of William IV 's successor , Victoria . As a woman , Victoria could not rule Hanover , which only permitted succession in the male line , so the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover came to an end . The Victorian era was marked by great cultural change , technological progress , and the establishment of the United Kingdom as one of the world 's foremost powers . In recognition of British rule over India , Victoria was declared Empress of India in 1876 . However , her reign was also marked by increased support for the republican movement , due in part to Victoria 's permanent mourning and lengthy period of seclusion following the death of her husband in 1861 . 
 Victoria 's son , Edward VII , became the first monarch of the House of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha in 1901 . In 1917 , the next monarch , George V , changed " Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha " to " Windsor " in response to the anti @-@ German sympathies aroused by the First World War . George V 's reign was marked by the separation of Ireland into Northern Ireland , which remained a part of the United Kingdom , and the Irish Free State , an independent nation , in 1922 . 
 = = = Shared monarchy = = = 
 During the twentieth century , the Commonwealth of Nations evolved from the British Empire . Prior to 1926 , the British Crown reigned over the British Empire collectively ; the Dominions and Crown colonies were subordinate to the United Kingdom . The Balfour Declaration of 1926 gave complete self @-@ government to the Dominions , effectively creating a system whereby a single monarch operated independently in each separate Dominion . The concept was solidified by the Statute of Westminster 1931 , which has been likened to " a treaty among the Commonwealth countries " . 
 The monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution , although it is often still referred to as " British " for legal and historical reasons and for convenience . The monarch became separately monarch of the United Kingdom , monarch of Canada , monarch of Australia , and so forth . The independent states within the Commonwealth would share the same monarch in a relationship likened to a personal union . 
 George V 's death in 1936 was followed by the accession of Edward VIII , who caused a public scandal by announcing his desire to marry the divorced American Wallis Simpson , even though the Church of England opposed the remarriage of <unk> . Accordingly , Edward announced his intention to abdicate ; the Parliaments of the United Kingdom and of other Commonwealth countries granted his request . Edward VIII and any children by his new wife were excluded from the line of succession , and the Crown went to his brother , George VI . George served as a rallying figure for the British people during World War II , making morale @-@ boosting visits to the troops as well as to munitions factories and to areas bombed by Nazi Germany . In June 1948 George VI relinquished the title Emperor of India , although remaining head of state of the Dominion of India . 
 At first , every member of the Commonwealth retained the same monarch as the United Kingdom , but when the Dominion of India became a republic in 1950 , it would no longer share in a common monarchy . Instead , the British monarch was acknowledged as " Head of the Commonwealth " in all Commonwealth member states , whether they were realms or republics . The position is purely ceremonial , and is not inherited by the British monarch as of right but is vested in an individual chosen by the Commonwealth heads of government . Member states of the Commonwealth that share the same person as monarch are known as Commonwealth realms . 
 = = = Monarchy in Ireland = = = 
 In 1155 the only English pope , Pope Adrian IV , authorised King Henry II of England to take possession of Ireland as a feudal territory nominally under papal overlordship . The pope wanted the English monarch to annex Ireland and bring the Irish church into line with Rome , despite this process already underway in Ireland by 1155 . An all @-@ island kingship of Ireland had being created in 854 by Máel Sechnaill mac <unk> <unk> . His last successor was Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair , who had become King of Ireland in early 1166 , and exiled Diarmait Mac Murchada , King of Leinster . Diarmait asked Henry II for help , gaining a group of Anglo @-@ Norman aristocrats and adventurers , led by Richard de Clare , 2nd Earl of Pembroke , to help him regain his throne . Diarmait and his Anglo @-@ Norman allies succeeded and he became King of Leinster again . De Clare married Diarmait 's daughter , and when Diarmait died in 1171 , de Clare became King of Leinster . Henry was afraid that de Clare would make Ireland a rival Norman kingdom , so he took advantage of the papal bull and invaded , forcing de Clare and the other Anglo @-@ Norman aristocrats in Ireland and the major Irish kings and lords to recognise him as their overlord . English lords came close to colonising the entire island , but a Gaelic resurgence from the 1260s resulted in the island divided between Gaelic @-@ Irish and Anglo @-@ Irish lords by 1400 . Many of the latter became completely Gaelicised , and did not recognise England 's kings except perhaps nominally . Some , such as Manus O 'Donnell and Conn O 'Neill , 1st Earl of Tyrone , were kings themselves . 
 By 1541 , King Henry VIII of England had broken with the Church of Rome and declared himself Supreme Head of the Church of England . The pope 's grant of Ireland to the English monarch became invalid , so Henry summoned a meeting of the Irish Parliament to change his title from Lord of Ireland to King of Ireland . However much of the island was beyond English control , resulting in the extended Tudor conquest of Ireland that only made the Kingdom of Ireland a reality in 1603 , at the conclusion of the Nine Years ' War ( Ireland ) . Nevertheless , Ireland retained its own parliament , becoming an independent state in 1642 @-@ 1649 ( Confederate Ireland ) , and again in 1688 @-@ 91 . Only warfare such as the Williamite War in Ireland and subsequent occupation enabled the English crown from 1692 , and successive British states from 1707 , to retain the country . 
 In 1800 , as a result of the Irish Rebellion of 1798 , the Act of Union merged the kingdom of Great Britain and the kingdom of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . The whole island of Ireland continued to be a part of the United Kingdom until 1922 , when what is now the Republic of Ireland won independence as the Irish Free State , a separate Dominion within the Commonwealth . The Irish Free State was renamed Éire ( or " Ireland " ) in 1937 , and in 1949 declared itself a republic , left the Commonwealth and severed all ties with the monarchy . Northern Ireland remained within the Union . In 1927 , the United Kingdom changed its name to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , while the monarch 's style for the next twenty years became " of Great Britain , Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas , King , Defender of the Faith , Emperor of India " . 
 = = = Modern status = = = 
 In the 1990s , Republicanism in the United Kingdom grew , partly on account of negative publicity associated with the Royal Family ( for instance , immediately following the death of Diana , Princess of Wales ) . However , recent polls show that around 70 – 80 % of the British public support the continuation of the monarchy . 
 = = Religious role = = 
 The sovereign is the Supreme Governor of the established Church of England . Archbishops and bishops are appointed by the monarch , on the advice of the Prime Minister , who chooses the appointee from a list of nominees prepared by a Church Commission . The Crown 's role in the Church of England is titular ; the most senior clergyman , the Archbishop of Canterbury , is the spiritual leader of the Church and of the worldwide Anglican Communion . The monarch takes an oath to preserve Church of Scotland and he or she holds the power to appoint the Lord High Commissioner to the Church 's General Assembly , but otherwise plays no part in its governance , and enjoys no powers over it . The Sovereign plays no formal role in the disestablished Church in Wales or Church of Ireland . 
 = = Succession = = 
 The relationship between the Commonwealth realms is such that any change to the laws governing succession to the shared throne requires the unanimous consent of all the realms . Succession is governed by statutes such as the Bill of Rights 1689 , the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Acts of Union 1707 . The rules of succession may only be changed by an Act of Parliament ; it is not possible for an individual to renounce his or her right of succession . The Act of Settlement restricts the succession to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover ( 1630 – 1714 ) , a granddaughter of James I. 
 Upon the death of the Sovereign , his or her heir immediately and automatically succeeds ( hence the phrase " The king is dead , long live the king ! " ) , and the accession of the sovereign is publicly proclaimed by an Accession Council that meets at St James 's Palace . The monarch is crowned in Westminster Abbey , normally by the Archbishop of Canterbury . A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign ; indeed , the ceremony usually takes place many months after accession to allow sufficient time for its preparation and for a period of mourning . 
 After an individual ascends the throne , he or she reigns until death . The only voluntary abdication , that of Edward VIII , had to be authorised by a special Act of Parliament , His Majesty 's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936 . The last monarch involuntarily removed from power was James VII and II , who fled into exile in 1688 during the Glorious Revolution . 
 = = = Restrictions by gender and religion = = = 
 Succession was largely governed by male @-@ preference cognatic primogeniture , under which sons inherit before daughters , and elder children inherit before younger ones of the same gender . The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , David Cameron , announced at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011 that all 16 Commonwealth realms , including the United Kingdom , had agreed to abolish the gender @-@ preference rule for anyone born after the date of the meeting , 28 October 2011 . They also agreed that future monarchs would no longer be prohibited from marrying a Roman Catholic – a law which dated from the Act of Settlement 1701 . However , since the monarch is also the Supreme Governor of the Church of England , the law which prohibits a Roman Catholic from acceding to the throne remains . The necessary UK legislation making the changes received the royal assent on 25 April 2013 and was brought into force in March 2015 after the equivalent legislation was approved in all the other Commonwealth realms . 
 Only individuals who are Protestants may inherit the Crown . Roman Catholics are prohibited from succeeding . An individual thus disabled from inheriting the Crown is deemed " naturally dead " for succession purposes , and the disqualification does not extend to the individual 's legitimate descendants . 
 = = = Regency = = = 
 The Regency Acts allow for regencies in the event of a monarch who is a minor or who is physically or mentally incapacitated . When a regency is necessary , the next qualified individual in the line of succession automatically becomes regent , unless they themselves are a minor or incapacitated . Special provisions were made for Queen Elizabeth II by the Regency Act 1953 , which stated that the Duke of Edinburgh ( the Queen 's husband ) could act as regent in these circumstances . 
 During a temporary physical infirmity or an absence from the kingdom , the sovereign may temporarily delegate some of his or her functions to Counsellors of State , the monarch 's spouse and the first four adults in the line of succession . The present Counsellors of State are : The Duke of Edinburgh , The Prince of Wales , The Duke of Cambridge , Prince Harry and The Duke of York . 
 = = Finances = = 
 Until 1760 the monarch met all official expenses from hereditary revenues , which included the profits of the Crown Estate ( the royal property portfolio ) . King George III agreed to surrender the hereditary revenues of the Crown in return for the Civil List , and this arrangement persisted until 2012 . An annual Property Services Grant @-@ in @-@ aid paid for the upkeep of the royal residences , and an annual Royal Travel Grant @-@ in @-@ Aid paid for travel . The Civil List covered most expenses , including those for staffing , state visits , public engagements , and official entertainment . Its size was fixed by Parliament every 10 years ; any money saved was carried forward to the next 10 @-@ year period . From 2012 until 2020 , the Civil List and Grants @-@ in @-@ Aid are to be replaced with a single Sovereign Grant , which will be set at 15 % of the revenues generated by the Crown Estate . 
 The Crown Estate is one of the largest property owners in the United Kingdom , with holdings of £ 7 @.@ 3 billion in 2011 . It is held in trust , and cannot be sold or owned by the Sovereign in a private capacity . In modern times , the profits surrendered from the Crown Estate to the Treasury have exceeded the Civil List and Grants @-@ in @-@ Aid . For example , the Crown Estate produced £ 200 million in the financial year 2007 – 8 , whereas reported parliamentary funding for the monarch was £ 40 million during the same period . 
 Like the Crown Estate , the land and assets of the Duchy of Lancaster , a property portfolio valued at £ 383 million in 2011 , are held in trust . The revenues of the Duchy form part of the Privy Purse , and are used for expenses not borne by the parliamentary grants . The Duchy of Cornwall is a similar estate held in trust to meet the expenses of the monarch 's eldest son . The Royal Collection , which includes artworks and the Crown Jewels , is not owned by the Sovereign personally and is held in trust , as are the occupied palaces in the United Kingdom such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle . 
 The sovereign is subject to indirect taxes such as value @-@ added tax , and since 1993 the Queen has paid income tax and capital gains tax on personal income . Parliamentary grants to the Sovereign are not treated as income as they are solely for official expenditure . Republicans estimate that the real cost of the monarchy , including security and potential income not claimed by the state , such as profits from the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall and rent of Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle , is £ 334 million a year .
