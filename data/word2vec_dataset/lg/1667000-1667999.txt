 As a result of the outbreak of World War I , Kaiser Barbarossa and her sisters were brought out of reserve and mobilized as the V Battle Squadron on 5 August 1914 . The ships were prepared for war very slowly , and they were not ready for service in the North Sea until the end of August . They were initially tasked with coastal defense , though they served in this capacity for a very short time . In mid @-@ September , the V Squadron was transferred to the Baltic , under the command of Prince Heinrich . He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault on Windau , but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan . Instead , the V Squadron was to carry the landing force , but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September . Kaiser Barbarossa and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day , disembarked the landing force , and then proceeded to the North Sea , where they resumed guard ship duties . Before the end of the year , the V Squadron was once again transferred to the Baltic . 
 After returning to the Baltic , Prince Heinrich ordered a foray toward Gotland . On 26 December 1914 , the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and then departed on the sortie . Two days later , the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag , and was back in Kiel by 30 December . The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties , but was withdrawn from frontline service in February 1915 . Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet , coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime , necessitated the deactivation of Kaiser Barbarossa and her sisters . Her crew was reduced on 5 March , only to be replaced on 11 April so the ship could be used as a torpedo target ship ; this service lasted until 9 November . Ten days later , she was decommissioned for the last time , and in 1916 she was disarmed . Kaiser Barbarossa was thereafter employed as a floating prison for prisoners of war in Wilhelmshaven . In November 1918 , Germany sought an end to the war and signed the First Armistice at Compiègne , which temporarily ended hostilities so a peace treaty could be negotiated . Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , which formally ended the war and was signed on 28 June 1919 , Germany was permitted to retain only six battleships of the " Deutschland or Lothringen types . " Accordingly , the ship was struck from the naval list on 6 December 1919 and sold to ship @-@ breakers . Kaiser Barbarossa was broken up for scrap metal in Rüstringen in 1919 and 1920 . 
 = Acer pseudoplatanus = 
 Acer pseudoplatanus , known as the sycamore in the United Kingdom and the sycamore maple in the United States , is a flowering plant species in the <unk> and lychee family <unk> . It is a large deciduous , broad @-@ leaved tree , tolerant of wind and coastal exposure . It is native to Central Europe and Western Asia , from France eastwards to Ukraine , northern Turkey and the Caucasus and southwards in the mountains of northern Spain and Italy . 
 The sycamore establishes itself easily from seed and was introduced to the British Isles by 1500 , and is now naturalised there and in other parts of Europe , North America , Australia and New Zealand where it may become an invasive species . 
 The sycamore can grow to a height of about 35 m ( 115 ft ) and the branches form a broad , rounded crown . The bark is grey , smooth when young and later flaking in irregular patches . The leaves grow on long <unk> and are large and palmate , with 5 large radiating lobes . The flowers are greenish @-@ yellow and hang in dangling flowerheads called panicles . They produce copious amounts of pollen and nectar that are attractive to insects . The winged seeds or samaras are borne in pairs and twirl to the ground when ripe . They germinate freely in the following spring . 
 In its native range , the sycamore is associated with a biodiverse range of invertebrates and fungi , but these are not always present in areas to which it has been introduced . It is sometimes planted in urban areas for its value as an amenity tree and produces a hard @-@ wearing , creamy @-@ white close @-@ grained timber that is used for making musical instruments , furniture , joinery , wood flooring and kitchen utensils . It also makes good firewood . The rising sap in spring has been used to extract sugar and make alcoholic and non @-@ alcoholic drinks , and honey is made by bees collecting the nectar . 
 = = Taxonomy and etymology = = 
 Acer pseudoplatanus was first described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum in 1753 . It is the type species in the maple genus Acer . Many forms and varieties have been proposed , including natural varieties such as var. <unk> Spach , var. <unk> Spach , and var. tomentosum <unk> , and forms such as f. <unk> ( Carrière ) Pax , f. purpureum ( Loudon ) Rehder , and f. variegatum ( Weston ) Rehder . These are all now considered to be synonyms of Acer pseudoplatanus L. 
 The specific name pseudoplatanus refers to the superficial similarity of the leaves and bark of the sycamore to those of plane trees in the genus Platanus , the prefix <unk> ( from Ancient Greek ) meaning " false " . However , the two genera are in different families that are only distantly related . Acer and Platanus differ in the position in which leaves are attached to the stem ( alternate in Platanus , paired or opposite in Acer ) and in their fruit , which are spherical clusters in Platanus and paired samaras ( winged fruit ) in Acer . 
 The common name " sycamore " originally applied to the fig species Ficus <unk> , the sycamore or <unk> referred to in the Bible , that is native to southwest Asia . Other common names for the tree include false plane @-@ tree , great maple , Scottish maple , mount maple , mock @-@ plane , or Celtic maple . 
 = = Description = = 
 The sycamore is a large , broadleaved deciduous tree that reaches 20 – 35 m ( 66 – 115 ft ) tall at maturity , the branches forming a broad , domed crown . The bark of young trees is smooth and grey but becomes rougher with age and breaks up into scales , exposing the pale @-@ brown @-@ to @-@ pinkish inner bark . 
 The buds are produced in opposite pairs , ovoid ( approximately oval in shape ) and pointed , with the bud scales ( the modified leaves that enclose and protect the bud ) green , edged in dark brown and with dark brown tips , 0 @.@ 5 – 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 @-@ 0 @.@ 4 in ) . When the leaves are shed they leave horseshoe shaped marks called leaf scars on the stem . The leaves are opposite , large , 10 to 25 cm ( 4 to 10 in ) long and broad , palmate with 5 pointed lobes that are coarsely toothed or serrated . They have a leathery texture with thick veins protruding on the underside . They are dark green in colour with a paler underside . Some cultivars have purple @-@ tinged or yellowish leaves . The leaf stalk or petiole is 5 to 15 cm ( 2 to 6 in ) long , is often tinged red with no stipules or leaf @-@ like structures at the base . 
 The monoecious ( or bisexual ) yellow @-@ green flowers are produced after the leaves in early summer , in May or June in the British Isles , on pendulous panicles 10 to 20 cm ( 4 to 8 in ) long with about 60 – 100 flowers on each stalk . The fruits are paired winged seeds or samaras , the seeds 5 to 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter , each with a wing 20 to 40 mm ( 0 @.@ 8 to 1 @.@ 6 in ) long developed as an extension of the ovary wall . The wings are held at about right angles to each other , distinguishing them from those of A. platanoides and A. campestre , in which the wings are almost opposite , and from those of A. saccharum , in which they are almost parallel . When shed , the wing of the samara catches the wind and rotates the fruit as it falls , slowing its descent and enabling the wind to disperse it further from the parent tree . The seeds are mature in autumn about four months after pollination . 
 The sycamore is tetraploid ( each cell having four sets of chromosomes , 2n = 52 ) , whereas A. campestre and A. platanoides are diploid ( with 2 sets of chromosomes , 2n = 26 ) . 
 = = Botany = = 
 Sycamore trees produce their flowers in hanging branched clusters known as panicles that contain a variety of different flower types . Most are morphologically bisexual , with both male and female organs , but function as if they were unisexual . Some are both morphologically and functionally male , others morphologically bisexual but function as males , and still others are morphologically bisexual but function as females . All of the flower types can produce pollen , but the pollen from functionally female flowers does not germinate . All flowers produce nectar , the functionally female flowers producing it in greater volume and with a higher sugar content . 
 Sycamore trees are very variable across their wide range and have strategies to prevent self @-@ pollination , which is undesirable because it limits the genetic variation of the progeny and may depress their vigour . Most inflorescences are formed of a mixture of functionally male and functionally female flowers . On any one tree , one or other of these flower types opens first and the other type opens later . Some trees may be male @-@ starters in one year and female @-@ starters in another . The change from one sex to the other may take place on different dates in different parts of the crown , and different trees in any one population may come into bloom over the course of several weeks , so that cross @-@ pollination is encouraged , although self @-@ pollination may not be completely prevented . 
 The sycamore may hybridise with other species in Acer section Acer , including with A. heldreichii where their natural ranges overlap and with <unk> <unk> hybrids with A. <unk> ( Acer section <unk> ) are also known , in which the basal lobes of the leaf are reduced in size , making the leaves appear almost three @-@ lobed ( <unk> ) . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 The sycamore is native to central and eastern Europe and western Asia . Its natural range includes Albania , Austria , Belgium , Bulgaria , Czech Republic , Georgia , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Italy , Lithuania , Poland , Romania , southern Russia , Switzerland and the former Yugoslavia . Reports of it occurring in eastern Turkey have been found to refer to A. heldreichii subsp. <unk> . It was probably introduced into Britain in the Tudor period by 1500 and was first recorded in the wild in 1632 in Kent . The date of its first introduction into Ireland is unclear , but the oldest specimen in Ireland is in County Cavan and dates from the seventeenth century . It was introduced into Sweden around 1770 with seeds obtained from Holland . 
 The lack of old native names for it has been used to demonstrate its absence in Britain before introduction in around 1487 , but this is challenged by the presence of an old Scottish Gaelic name for the tree , <unk> <unk> which suggests a longer presence in Scotland at least as far back as the Gaelic settlement at Dál Riata in the late 6th and early 7th centuries . This would make it either an <unk> ( a naturalised tree introduced by humans before 1500 ) or perhaps native if it can be seen to have reached Scotland without human intervention . At the moment it is usually classified as a neophyte , a plant that is naturalised but arrived with humans on or after the year 1500 . Today , the sycamore is present in 3 @,@ 461 ( 89 @.@ 7 % ) of <unk> in Britain , more than any native tree species . 
 The sycamore has been introduced to suitable locations outside Europe as an attractive tree for park , street or garden . These include the United States , Canada , Australia ( Victoria and Tasmania ) , Chile and New Zealand , Patagonia and the laurel forests of Madeira and the Azores . At the time of its introduction it was probably not appreciated that its prolific production of seeds might one day cause a problem to the landscape as it spread and out @-@ competed native species . The tree is now considered to be an environmental weed in some parts of Australia ( Yarra Ranges , Victoria ) and also Mount Macedon , near Daylesford , parts of the Dandenong Ranges and Tasmania , where it is naturalised in the eucalypt forests . It is also considered to be an invasive species in New Zealand , Norway , and environmentally sensitive locations in the United Kingdom . 
 In about 1870 , the sycamore was introduced into the United States , and was planted in New York and New Jersey . It was later cultivated as a park or street tree in New England and the Mid @-@ Atlantic states . By the early part of the 21st century , it was naturalised in fourteen states ( Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Kentucky , Maine , Michigan , North Carolina , New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island and Washington , D.C. ) , and in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia and Ontario . The United States Department of Agriculture considers it an invasive species . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 In its native range , the sycamore is a natural component of birch ( Betula sp . ) , beech ( Fagus sp . ) and fir ( Abies sp . ) forests . It readily invades disturbed habitats such as forest plantations , abandoned farmland and brownfield land , railway lines and roadsides verges , hedgerows , native and semi @-@ natural woodland and , in New Zealand , high country tussock grassland . As an introduced , invasive species it may degrade the laurel forest in Madeira and Portugal and is a potential threat to the rare endemic Madeiran orchid , Dactylorhiza foliosa . 
 It is tolerant of a wide range of soil types and pH , except heavy clay and is at its best on nutrient @-@ rich slightly calcareous soils . The roots of the sycamore form highly specific beneficial mycorrhizal associations with the fungus <unk> hoi which promotes phosphorus uptake from the soil . Sycamore <unk> are of the internal arbuscular mycorrhizal type , in which the fungus grows within the tissues of the root and forms branched , tree @-@ like structures within the cells of the root cortex . 
 The larvae of a number of species of moth use the leaves as a food source . These include the sycamore moth ( <unk> <unk> ) , the maple prominent ( <unk> <unk> ) and the plumed prominent ( <unk> <unk> ) . The horse @-@ chestnut leaf miner ( <unk> <unk> ) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore , although 70 % of the larvae do not survive beyond the second instar . The leaves attract aphids , and also the ladybirds and hoverflies that feed on them . The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects , and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as voles and birds . As an introduced plant , in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species , but it does have a larger range of leafhoppers than does the native field maple . 
 The tree may also be attacked by the horse chestnut scale insect ( <unk> regalis ) which sucks sap from the trunk and branches , but does not cause serious damage to the tree . Sometimes squirrels will strip the bark off branches , girdling the stem ; as a result whole branches may die , leaving brown , wilted leaves . 
 The sycamore gall mite Eriophyes macrorhynchus produces small red galls , similar to those of the nail gall mite Eriophyes <unk> , on leaves of sycamore and field maple , Acer campestris from April onwards . Another mite , <unk> <unk> causes a ' sycamore felt gall ' on the underside of leaves of both sycamore and Norway maple ( Acer platanoides ) . The sycamore aphid <unk> <unk> sucks sap from buds and foliage , producing large quantities of sticky honeydew that contaminate foliage , cars and garden furniture beneath . 
 The sycamore is susceptible to sooty bark disease , caused by the fungus <unk> <unk> . This causes wilting of the crown and the death of branches . Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores . The fungus may be present in the heartwood without symptoms for many years , working its way towards the bark following long , hot summers . The spores are hyper @-@ allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper ’ s disease , a hypersensitivity pneumonitis . Less serious is the fungus <unk> <unk> which often forms the disease known as tar spot , in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage . The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected . Sycamore leaf spot , caused by the fungus <unk> <unk> , results in pale blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall . This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 Sycamore self @-@ seeds very vigorously , the seeds germinating en masse in the spring so that there is little , or no , seed bank in the soil . It is readily propagated from seed in cultivation , but varieties cannot be relied on to breed true . Special cultivars such A. pseudoplatanus ' <unk> ' may be propagated by grafting . This variety is notable for the bright salmon @-@ pink colour of the young foliage and is the only sycamore cultivar to have gained the Royal Horticultural Society 's Award of Garden Merit . A rare weeping form with dangling branches , A. pseudoplatanus var. pendulum , was first sold by Knight & Perry 's exotic nursery in Chelsea , England before 1850 when the name was published by W.H. Baxter in the Supplement to Loudon 's Hortus <unk> , but no specimens of this cultivar are known to survive . 
 The sycamore is noted for its tolerance of wind , urban pollution , salt spray , and low summer temperatures , which makes it a popular tree for planting in cities , along roads treated with salt in winter , and in coastal localities . It is cultivated and widely naturalised north of its native range in Northern Europe , notably in the British Isles and Scandinavia north to Tromsø , Norway ( seeds can ripen as far north as Vesterålen ) ; Reykjavík , Iceland ; and Tórshavn on the Faroe Islands . It now occurs throughout the British Isles , having been introduced in the 16th century . 
 Sycamores make new growth from the stump or roots if cut down and can therefore be coppiced to produce poles and other types of small timber . Its coppice stools grow comparatively rapidly , reaching up to 10 feet in diameter in 450 years . It is grown as a species for medium to large bonsai in many areas of Europe where some fine specimens can be found . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Sycamore is planted in parks for ornamental purposes , and sometimes as a street tree , since its tolerance of air pollution makes it suitable for use in urban plantings . Because of its tolerance to wind , it has often been planted in coastal and exposed areas as a windbreak . 
 It produces a hard @-@ wearing , white or cream close @-@ grained timber that turns golden with age . The wood can be worked and sawn in any direction and is used for making musical instruments , furniture , joinery , wood flooring and <unk> . Because it is non @-@ staining , is used for kitchen utensils , wooden spoons , bowls , rolling pins and chopping boards . In Scotland it has traditionally been used for making fine boxes , sometimes in association with contrasting , dark @-@ coloured laburnum wood . The reference to the " white maple " in the English Christmas carol , " Wassail , Wassail All Over the Town " , in " Our bowl , it is made of the white maple tree " presumably refers not to the silver or white maple ( A. saccharinum ) , which does not occur naturally in Europe , but to the white wood of the sycamore or the field maple , Acer campestre . 
 Occasionally , trees produce wood with a wavy grain , greatly increasing the value for decorative veneers . The wood is a medium weight for a hardwood , weighing 630 kg per cubic metre . It is a traditional wood for use in making the backs , necks and scrolls of violins . The wood is often marketed as rippled sycamore . Whistles can be made from straight twigs when the rising sap allows the bark to be separated , and these , and sycamore branches , are used in customs associated with early May in Cornwall . The wood is used for fuel , being easy to saw and to split with an axe , producing a hot flame and good embers when burnt . 
 In Scotland , sycamores were once a favoured tree for hangings , because their lower branches rarely broke under the strain . Both male and female flowers produce abundant nectar , which makes a fragrant , delicately flavoured and pale @-@ coloured honey . The nectar and copious dull yellow ochre pollen are collected by honeybees as food sources . The sap rises vigorously in the spring and like that of sugar maple can be tapped to provide a refreshing drink , as a source of sugar and to make beer .

Not only was it claimed to be the " largest sycamore in Scotland " but also the scene of James Lord Forrester 's murder in 1679 . The tree was blown down in a storm on Boxing Day 1998 , but a replacement , grown from a cutting , now stands in the churchyard of Corstorphine Kirk .

Filled with amazement , people hung rags on the tree and pressed coins into its trunk as votive offerings and it became known as the " Money Tree " . Some years later , it fell down , but new shoots appeared from its base , and the water still welled up . It remains a place of veneration on St Fintan 's day , February 17 . 
 = Tropical Storm Larry ( 2003 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Larry was the twelfth tropical storm in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season . It was one of eight storms to impact Mexico from either the Pacific or Atlantic Oceans in the season , a near @-@ record . Larry formed in early October from an extratropical storm in the Bay of Campeche , and reached a peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) . Due to weak steering currents , the storm moved southward , which resulted in the storm hitting the Tabasco coastline . The storm was the first <unk> landfall since Tropical Storm Brenda in 1973 . 
 Larry drifted across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec , dropping heavy rainfall of over 9 in ( 229 mm ) in places . The rainfall led to flooding and mudslides , causing damage to thousands of houses . The flooding killed five people and resulted in $ 53 @.@ 6 million ( 2003 USD ) in damage . Larry was one of three tropical cyclones to hit Mexico in a short period of time , including Tropical Depression Nora and Tropical Storm Olaf in the eastern Pacific Ocean . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 17 . It moved across the shear @-@ ridden Atlantic Ocean without development , and remained disorganized until reaching the western Caribbean Sea on September 26 . There , the wave situated itself beneath an upper @-@ level anticyclone , allowing for favorable upper @-@ level outflow and for deep convection to develop . On the September 27 , a low pressure area developed while the system was located a few hundred miles to the east of the Yucatán Peninsula . The system continued to organize , and nearly developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore on the Yucatán Peninsula on September 29 . 
 Dry air and land weakened the tropical wave , and when it entered the area of the Bay of Campeche , it merged with a stationary frontal boundary . Cool , dry air around the system caused the system to develop a cold core , and the area organized into an extratropical low on September 30 . A large high pressure system over the northern Gulf of Mexico forced the system southward , where it developed significant convection . The system developed a warm core , and on October 1 the storm organized into Tropical Storm Larry while located 300 mi ( 483 km ) east @-@ southeast of Tampico , Mexico . 
 Weak steering currents allowed for Larry to drift westward at about two mph ( 3 km / h ) while marginally favorable conditions allowed the storm to strengthen to a peak of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) on October 3 . A mid @-@ level ridge forced the storm more to the south @-@ southeast , where after remaining a 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) storm for three days , Larry made landfall on Paraíso in the Mexican state of Tabasco on October 5 . It steadily weakened over land , and degenerated into a remnant low on October 6 while mid @-@ way through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec . The remnant low turned to the southwest , and reached the eastern Pacific Ocean on the October 7 . The remnants of Larry re @-@ organized in the eastern Pacific , with the National Hurricane Center indicating for the possibility of redevelopment into a tropical depression on October 9 . However , the convection diminished , and further development was no longer anticipated .

 Due to its erratic motion , the Mexican government issued a Tropical Storm Warning and a Hurricane Watch early in Larry 's lifetime from Veracruz to Campeche . The watches and warnings were extended westward to Tuxpan on the 4th and extended eastward to Ciudad del Carmen on October 5 . Due to the threat of the storm , officials closed three Pemex oil ports . The company used its reserves to make sure profits weren 't disrupted . In addition , the storm closed shipping ports in Dos Bocas in Tabasco , Coatzacoalcos in Veracruz , and Cayo Arcas in Campeche . The Mexican government placed six coastal states on maximum alert , while authorities set up 75 evacuation shelters for around 1 @,@ 500 people . Because of the storm , the government declared much of eastern Mexico a state of emergency .

 Tropical Storm Larry was one of eight storms to hit Mexico from either the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean , the highest since the record of nine in 1971 . The National Hurricane Center expected the storm to produce a storm surge of 3 to 5 feet ( .9 to 1 @.@ 5 m ) , with high waves on top , though no official surge readings were reported . The highest recorded winds on land were 59 mph ( 95 km / h ) in El <unk> in Tabasco . The worst of Larry 's effects came from its rainfall , peaking at 24 @.@ 77 inches ( 629 @.@ 2 mm ) in Upper Juarez in southeastern Mexico . The highest 24 @-@ hour rainfall total was 9 @.@ 6 inches ( 245 @.@ 5 mm ) in Tortuguero , Chiapas , while several other locations reported over 4 inches ( 102 mm ) in 24 hours .

 = Canterbury = 
 Canterbury ( / <unk> / , / <unk> / , or / <unk> / ) is a historic English cathedral city and UNESCO World Heritage Site , which lies at the heart of the City of Canterbury , a local government district of Kent , England . It lies on the River Stour . 
 The Archbishop of Canterbury is the primate of the Church of England and the worldwide Anglican Communion owing to the importance of St Augustine , who served as the apostle to the pagan Kingdom of Kent around the turn of the 7th century . The city 's cathedral became a major focus of pilgrimage following the 1170 martyrdom of Thomas Becket . A journey of pilgrims to his shrine served as the frame for Geoffrey Chaucer 's 14th century classic The Canterbury Tales . 
 Canterbury is a popular tourist destination : consistently one of the most @-@ visited cities in the United Kingdom , the city 's economy is heavily reliant upon tourism . The city has been occupied since Paleolithic times and served as the capital of the Celtic <unk> and Jute Kingdom of Kent . Many historical structures fill the area , including a city wall founded in Roman times and rebuilt in the 14th century , the ruins of St Augustine 's Abbey and a Norman castle , and the oldest extant school in the world , the King 's School . Modern additions include the Marlowe Theatre and the St Lawrence Ground , home of the Kent County Cricket Club . There is also a substantial student population , brought about by the presence of the University of Kent , Canterbury Christ Church University , the University for the Creative Arts , and the <unk> American University Canterbury campus . Canterbury remains , however , a relatively small city in terms of geographical size , when compared with other British cities . 
 = = Name = = 
 The Roman settlement of Durovernum Cantiacorum ( " Kentish Durovernum " ) occupied the location of an earlier British town whose ancient British name has been reconstructed as * <unk> ̯ <unk> ( " Stronghold by the Alder Grove " ) , although the name is sometimes supposed to have derived from various British names for the Stour . ( Medieval variants of the Roman name include <unk> and <unk> . ) In Sub @-@ Roman Britain , it was known in Old Welsh as Cair <unk> ( " Fortress of Kent " ) . Occupied by the Jutes , it became known in Old English as <unk> ( " Kentish Stronghold " ) , which developed into its present name . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 The Canterbury area has been inhabited since prehistoric times . Lower Paleolithic axes , and Neolithic and Bronze Age pots have been found in the area . Canterbury was first recorded as the main settlement of the Celtic tribe of the <unk> , which inhabited most of modern @-@ day Kent . In the 1st century AD , the Romans captured the settlement and named it Durovernum Cantiacorum . The Romans rebuilt the city , with new streets in a grid pattern , a theatre , a temple , a forum , and public baths . Although they did not maintain a major military garrison , its position on Watling Street relative to the major Kentish ports of Rutupiae ( Richborough ) , <unk> ( Dover ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) gave it considerable strategic importance . In the late 3rd century , to defend against attack from barbarians , the Romans built an earth bank around the city and a wall with seven gates , which enclosed an area of 130 acres ( 53 ha ) . 
 Despite being counted as one of the 28 cities of Sub @-@ Roman Britain , it seems that after the Romans left Britain in 410 Durovernum Cantiacorum was abandoned except by a few farmers and gradually decayed . Over the next 100 years , an Anglo @-@ Saxon community formed within the city walls , as Jutish refugees arrived , possibly intermarrying with the locals . In 597 , Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine to convert its King Æthelberht to Christianity . After the conversion , Canterbury , being a Roman town , was chosen by Augustine as the centre for his episcopal see in Kent , and an abbey and cathedral were built . Augustine thus became the first Archbishop of Canterbury . The town 's new importance led to its revival , and trades developed in pottery , textiles , and leather . By 630 , gold coins were being struck at the Canterbury mint . In 672 , the Synod of Hertford gave the see of Canterbury authority over the entire English Church . 
 In 842 and 851 , Canterbury suffered great loss of life during Danish raids . In 978 , Archbishop Dunstan refounded the abbey built by Augustine , and named it St Augustine 's Abbey . A second wave of Danish attacks began in 991 , and in 1011 the cathedral was burnt and Archbishop Alphege was killed in 1012 . Remembering the destruction caused by the Danes , the inhabitants of Canterbury did not resist William the Conqueror 's invasion in 1066 . William immediately ordered a wooden motte @-@ and @-@ bailey castle to be built by the Roman city wall . In the early 12th century , the castle was rebuilt with stone . 
 After the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket at the cathedral in 1170 , Canterbury became one of the most notable towns in Europe , as pilgrims from all parts of Christendom came to visit his shrine . This pilgrimage provided the framework for Geoffrey Chaucer 's 14th @-@ century collection of stories , The Canterbury Tales . Canterbury Castle was captured by the French Prince Louis during his 1215 invasion of England , before the death of John caused his English supporters to desert his cause and support the young Henry III . 
 Canterbury is associated with several saints from this period who lived in Canterbury : 
 Saint Augustine of Canterbury 
 Saint Anselm of Canterbury 
 Saint Thomas Becket 
 Saint Mellitus 
 Saint Theodore of Tarsus 
 Saint Dunstan 
 Saint Adrian of Canterbury 
 Saint Alphege 
 Saint Æthelberht of Kent

 The Black Death hit Canterbury in 1348 . At 10 @,@ 000 , Canterbury had the 10th largest population in England ; by the early 16th century , the population had fallen to 3 @,@ 000 . In 1363 , during the Hundred Years ' War , a Commission of Inquiry found that disrepair , stone @-@ robbing and ditch @-@ filling had led to the Roman wall becoming eroded . Between 1378 and 1402 , the wall was virtually rebuilt , and new wall towers were added . In 1381 , during Wat Tyler 's Peasants ' Revolt , the castle and Archbishop 's Palace were sacked , and Archbishop Sudbury was beheaded in London . Sudbury is still remembered annually by the Christmas mayoral procession to his tomb at Canterbury Cathedral . In 1413 Henry IV became the only sovereign to be buried at the cathedral . In 1448 Canterbury was granted a City Charter , which gave it a mayor and a high sheriff ; the city still has a Lord Mayor and Sheriff . In 1504 the cathedral 's main tower , the Bell Harry Tower , was completed , ending 400 years of building . 
 During the Dissolution of the Monasteries , the city 's priory , nunnery and three friaries were closed . St Augustine 's Abbey , the 14th richest in England at the time , was surrendered to the Crown , and its church and cloister were levelled . The rest of the abbey was dismantled over the next 15 years , although part of the site was converted to a palace . Thomas Becket 's shrine in the Cathedral was demolished and all the gold , silver and jewels were removed to the Tower of London , and Becket 's images , name and feasts were obliterated throughout the kingdom , ending the pilgrimages . 
 By the 17th century , Canterbury 's population was 5 @,@ 000 ; of whom 2 @,@ 000 were French @-@ speaking Protestant Huguenots , who had begun fleeing persecution and war in the Spanish Netherlands in the mid @-@ 16th century . The Huguenots introduced silk weaving into the city , which by 1676 had outstripped wool weaving . 
 In 1620 Robert Cushman negotiated the lease of the Mayflower at 59 Palace Street for the purpose of transporting the Pilgrims to America . 
 In 1647 , during the English Civil War , riots broke out when Canterbury 's puritan mayor banned church services on Christmas Day . The rioters ' trial the following year led to a Kent revolt against the Parliamentarian forces , contributing to the start of the second phase of the war . However , Canterbury surrendered peacefully to the Parliamentarians after their victory at the Battle of Maidstone .

 The city 's first newspaper , the Kentish Post , was founded in 1717 . It merged with the newly founded Kentish Gazette in 1768 . 
 By 1770 , the castle had fallen into disrepair , and many parts of it were demolished during the late 18th century and early 19th century . In 1787 all the gates in the city wall , except for Westgate — the city jail — were demolished as a result of a commission that found them impeding to new coach travel . Canterbury Prison was opened in 1808 just outside the city boundary . By 1820 the city 's silk industry had been killed by imported Indian muslins ; its trade was thereafter mostly limited to hops and wheat . The Canterbury and Whitstable Railway , the world 's first passenger railway , was opened in 1830 ; bankrupt by 1844 , it was purchased by the South Eastern Railway , which connected the town to its larger network in 1846 . The London , Chatham , and Dover arrived in 1860 ; the competition and cost @-@ cutting between the lines was resolved by merging them as the South Eastern and Chatham in 1899 . In 1848 , St Augustine 's Abbey was refurbished for use as a missionary college for the Church of England 's representatives in the British colonies . Between 1830 and 1900 , the city 's population grew from 15 @,@ 000 to 24 @,@ 000 . 
 During the First World War , a number of barracks and voluntary hospitals were set up around the city , and in 1917 a German bomber crash @-@ landed near Broad Oak Road . During the Second World War , 10 @,@ 445 bombs dropped during 135 separate raids destroyed 731 homes and 296 other buildings in the city , including the missionary college and Simon Langton Girls ' Grammar Schools , and 115 people were killed . The most devastating raid was on 1 June 1942 during the Baedeker Blitz . 
 Before the end of the war , architect Charles Holden drew up plans to redevelop the city centre , but locals were so opposed that the Citizens ' Defence Association was formed and swept to power in the 1945 municipal elections . Rebuilding of the city centre eventually began 10 years after the war . A ring road was constructed in stages outside the city walls some time afterwards to alleviate growing traffic problems in the city centre , which was later pedestrianised . The biggest expansion of the city occurred in the 1960s , with the arrival of the University of Kent at Canterbury and Christ Church College . 
 The 1980s saw visits from Pope John Paul II and Queen Elizabeth II , and the beginning of the annual Canterbury Festival . Canterbury received its own radio station in CTFM , now KMFM Canterbury , in 1997 . Between 1999 and 2005 , the Whitefriars Shopping Centre underwent major redevelopment . In 2000 , during the redevelopment , a major archaeological project was undertaken by the Canterbury Archaeological Trust , known as the Big Dig , which was supported by Channel Four 's Time Team . 
 Another famous visitor was Mahatma Gandhi , who came to the city in October 1931 ; he met Hewlett Johnson , then Dean of Canterbury .

The City Council has invested heavily in Park and Ride systems around the City 's outskirts and there are three sites : at Wincheap , New Dover Road and Sturry Road . There are plans to build direct access <unk> to and from the London directions of the A2 where it meets the congested Wincheap ( at present there are only slips from the A28 to and from the direction of Dover ) to allow more direct access to Canterbury from the A2 , but these are currently subject to local discussion . In 2011 a third junction was constructed , linking the A28 to the northbound A2 ; this leaves just the A2 southbound exit missing , but since this would cut across the Park & Ride car park and meet the A28 at an already complicated junction , it is not expected to be added in the near term .

 = Cavalera Conspiracy = 
 Cavalera Conspiracy is an American heavy metal band founded by Brazilian brothers Max ( vocals , guitar ) and Igor Cavalera ( drums ) , currently performing along with American musicians Marc Rizzo ( guitar ) and Johny Chow ( bass ) . The band originally formed in 2007 as Inflikted but changed its name for legal reasons . The group 's creation marked the end of a 10 @-@ year feud between the Cavalera brothers who founded Sepultura in the early 1980s . 
 Following the brothers ' falling out , Max had formed a new band , Soulfly , and Igor had recorded four studio albums with Sepultura before leaving the band in January 2006 . In July 2006 , Max received an unexpected call from his brother , and by the end of the conversation , Max had invited Igor to visit him in Phoenix , Arizona , to perform in a Soulfly show . Igor joined Soulfly in concert and performed two Sepultura songs . After the show , Max suggested they begin a new project , and Igor accepted . To complete the band , Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and the Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier to play bass guitar . The group then recorded their debut album at Undercity Studios in Los Angeles with engineer and co @-@ producer Logan Mader in July 2007 . Named after the band 's original moniker , Inflikted was released through Roadrunner Records on 25 March 2008 .

 On 16 August 1996 at 1 : 43 a.m. , Max Cavalera 's stepson Dana Wells , was killed in a car accident at the age of 21 in Phoenix , Arizona . At the time , Cavalera was the lead vocalist for Sepultura which was on tour promoting its sixth studio album , Roots , in England with Ozzy Osbourne . After hearing the news , Ozzy and his wife Sharon Osbourne hired a private plane to take Cavalera and his wife , manager and mother of Dana , Gloria , back home . After the funeral , Max returned his focus to Sepultura , and the band resumed its European tour . Then , following a sold @-@ out show at London 's Brixton Academy on 16 December — later documented on the live album Under a Pale Grey Sky — drummer Igor Cavalera , guitarist Andreas Kisser , and bassist Paulo Jr. told Max they wanted to replace numerous members of the band 's staff , including Gloria . Andreas , Paulo and Igor proposed ending the contract with Gloria and hiring a new manager for Sepultura , saying that she paid more attention to Max than the band . The trio suggested that she could continue as Max 's personal manager but that someone else should manage the band . Gloria refused . Max felt betrayed by his mates , especially his brother . 
 Max decided to leave Sepultura , as he felt that his band mates were " biting the hands that feeds " . In an interview with Revolver magazine 's May 2008 issue , Max explained that Gloria had worked for Sepultura for two years without earning one dollar , just for the passion of the music . Disagreeing with the other Sepultura members , Max said , " If this is how it 's going down , I 'm out . I quit . I can 't just put a mask on and backstab a bunch of people that trust me . " Later , Max stated that it was the hardest decision he had to make in his life . 
 His departure from Sepultura caused a 10 @-@ year feud between the Cavalera brothers . During this period , Max formed a new band , Soulfly , which has released nine studio albums . Igor continued as Sepultura 's drummer , appearing on the group 's next four studio records before leaving in January 2006 to work on his DJ project , <unk> , and to spend more time with his family . 
 In July 2006 , while Soulfly was on tour , Max received a call from his brother , and by the end of the conversation , Max had invited Igor to visit him in Phoenix for the tenth anniversary of D @-@ Low , an annual memorial show for Dana . At the concert , Igor joined Soulfly and performed two Sepultura songs , " Roots Bloody Roots " and " Attitude , " for which Dana had written the lyrics . In an interview with Chad Bowar for About.com , Max stated that performance was " the birth of Cavalera Conspiracy " . After the show , Max suggested they begin a new project after Soulfly finished touring . Max confessed to Bowar that he had lied to Igor when he said all the songs were ready when he had only finished one . He added , " It was one of those good lies . Everything rolled from there . What I like about the Conspiracy is that nothing is really planned . One thing leads to another . There 's no pressure and it feels like a different project than anything I 've done . "

 Before talking with his brother , Max wrote a song entitled " Inflikted , " inspired by Sepultura 's visit in 1992 to Indonesia where they saw a " crazy ritual " . Describing what he saw , Max said , " There was self @-@ inflicted pain , knives , blood , fire . It was insane . It stuck in my head . " Max stated that " Inflikted " was supposed to go towards Soulfly 's sixth studio album Conquer , but he wanted to do the song with Igor . For legal reasons , they could not use Inflikted as the band name . According to Max , " A lot of people had used it before , so he had to come up with something else . " When trying to find a name , he " blurted out " Cavalera Conspiracy , and Igor liked it . Max added , " I think I like it better than Inflikted . It has a ring to it that connects me and Igor as two brothers back together . " 
 = = = Inflikted ( 2007 – 2009 ) = = = 
 To complete the band , Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and vocalist Joe Duplantier of Gojira . Rizzo was his choice because , according to Max , he and Rizzo " play together in Soulfly and musically we are like twin brothers " . Max also said that he talked to Rizzo about going back to the roots of the mid @-@ 1980s thrash metal , which he did with Sepultura . Max continues , " Marc was completely into it and he did great . He surpassed what I asked him to do . " Max stated that Duplantier was Gloria 's idea , as he did not know him at all . He added , " We had no idea who the guy is , he 's from a different continent and we don 't speak French . I did know the Gojira CD . But I like the element of surprise and danger Joe brought . " 
 In July 2007 , the band recorded their debut album at Undercity Studios in Los Angeles with engineer and co @-@ producer Logan Mader ( who played in Soulfly for a year after leaving Machine Head in 1999 ) and Lucas Banker of the Dirty Icon production team . The album included guest appearances of bassist Rex Brown on the song " Ultra @-@ Violent " , and Max 's stepson Ritchie Cavalera singing on " Black Ark " . The band made their debut live performance on August 31 , 2007 at the 11th Annual D @-@ Low Memorial Concert in Tempe , AZ . Inflikted , named after the band 's original moniker , was released through Roadrunner Records on 25 March 2008 . Commercially , Inflikted did not have great sales , reaching moderate positions on the charts . The album reached the top 30 on Austria , Finland and Germany , and the top 40 on Australia and Belgium . Having sold more than 9 @,@ 000 copies during its first week , Inflikted peaked at number 72 on the Billboard 200 chart . 
 The <unk> supporting the debut album began on 30 May 2008 , when Cavalera Conspiracy played its first official concert at the Electric Weekend festival in Madrid , Spain . However , for this live performance and the subsequent European tour , the band had to replace Duplantier , who was unable to join Cavalera Conspiracy on the road as he was recording Gojira 's fourth studio album , The Way of All Flesh . He was replaced by Johny Chow of Fireball Ministry . Between June and mid @-@ July 2008 , the band performed in several festivals , including appearances at the Pinkpop Festival , Rock am Ring and Rock im Park , Download Festival , Graspop Metal Meeting , <unk> , among others . 
 The band then returned to the United States for a North American tour from mid @-@ July to August 2008 , featuring headling dates with The Dillinger Escape Plan , Throwdown , Bury Your Dead , and <unk> . Cavalera Conspiracy also performed at the Monsters of Rock festival , which was held on 26 July at McMahon Stadium in Calgary , Canada , and the one @-@ day Ozzfest at the Pizza Hut Park on 9 August . During its tour , Cavalera Conspiracy performed on several dates with Judas Priest at the Priest Feast throughout Eastern Europe , but both bands cancelled their shows in Australia and New Zealand , which were scheduled for September 2008 . In a press release , promoters claimed the cancellation was due to " logistic and freight issues " , but Max Cavalera wrote on the band 's website that they were " banned " from performing in New Zealand and Australia because someone — whom he did not specify — " deemed " them an " inappropriate " band and " too inflammatory " . 
 Due to commitments of Max with Soulfly and Igor with <unk> , Cavalera Conspiracy was put on hold until August 2009 , when the band regrouped to touring in Europe and Japan , including shows at the <unk> , Summer Sonic , Pukkelpop , and <unk> festivals , and two September 2009 dates in Austria and Russia .

 In October 2009 , Max told Noisecreep that he and his brother Igor have plans to work on a second Cavalera Conspiracy album together . The following month , Noisecreep spoke with Igor about a new Cavalera Conspiracy album . Igor said that he and Max are both busy with their main commitments , but " We have some ideas of maybe doing a remix album of [ Inflikted ] and have people like Justice or Soulwax — even some dub artists that my brother likes — remix the whole album , " he says . " But that 's just an idea . It 's nothing confirmed . But me and Max are talking about doing a new album in the future , but there 's no pressure . There 's nobody from the label or the agents trying to push us to do it as quick as possible . " 
 Cavalera Conspiracy entered the studio in April 2010 to begin recording the follow @-@ up to their 2008 debut album , Inflikted . In May 2010 , the band finished recording with producer Logan Mader in co @-@ production with Max . Cavalera Conspiracy recruited their touring bassist Johny Chow to play bass on the album , as former member Joe Duplantier was busy with Gojira 's next album . Upon finished recordings , Roadrunner Records confirmed that the band 's new album would not be released until early 2011 . 
 On 16 November 2010 , in an article on <unk> it was revealed that the band 's second album would be titled Blunt Force Trauma , and would be released on 29 March 2011 . A tracklist for the album was also revealed . 
 Prior to the album 's release , two songs were published by the band . The song " Killing inside " was released via the homepage of the band 's label Roadrunner Records and the Cavalera Conspiracy newsletter . The download was only available from 7 February 2011 until 9 February 2011 . The title track " Blunt Force Trauma " was released on 17 February 2011 as a stream via the Roadrunner Records homepage . 
 In a November 2012 concert in Belo Horizonte , original Sepultura lead guitarist Jairo <unk> joined the band ( performing with Tony Campos on bass ) to perform Troops of Doom .

 In September 2013 Max Cavalera stated his intent to begin work on a new Cavalera Conspiracy album in 2014 , which will be predominantly grindcore . Igor then implied on October 1 that the album could consist solely of the two brothers , without involvement from Marc Rizzo or Johnny Chow , with the album produced by James Murphy . However this was proven false when Max 's wife Gloria announced the trio of Max , Igor and Marc entering the studio with producer John Gray in late December 2013 , along with the announcement on 31 December of Nate Newton of Converge as the band 's new bassist . 
 In August 2014 , a new song titled " Banzai Kamikaze " was uploaded to Napalm 's Soundcloud account . The new Cavalera Conspiracy album Pandemonium was released on 31 October 2014 in Europe and on 4 November 2014 in North America . 2015 saw Johnny Chow return to Cavalera Conspiracy on bass for live shows , however the group 's Facebook page lists Chow , Newton and Campos as rotating live duties on bass . 
 = = Style , lyrics and reception = = 
 Revolver 's Jon Wiederhorn , pointed out that although the songs were arranged and recorded quickly , Inflikted sounds neither hastily executed nor incomplete . There 's a connection between Max 's riffing and Igor 's drumming ; a chemistry that comes only from musicians who learned to play together and honed their craft through years of studio sessions and live shows . Wiederhorn described Inflikted as an " explosive flashback to the remorseless thrash and primal groove @-@ metal Sepultura created between 1991 's Arise and 1993 's Chaos A.D. [ ... ] The songs are raw and simple , yet graced with syncopated drum runs , experimental guitar flourishes , and sonic frills inspired by Max 's love of reggae and Igor 's fascination with DJ culture . The vocals are primal and savage , emboldened by a sense of urgency that 's equal parts desperation , rage , and celebration . " 
 On Inflikted , Max was the group 's songwriter and lyricist . At the time of the album recording , he was watching the same four movies almost every day : Apocalypse Now , City of God , A Clockwork Orange , and La Haine . Max revealed to Revolver that he wanted to do something different , and it gave him a lot of ideas . He said , " What came out of this album was more than enough to fill the void of not working together for so long . It 's pretty intense . From the first moment , it 's war . " 
 Allmusic 's Eduardo Rivadavia , said that release of Inflikted " brings to fruition one of the most anticipated yet most improbable reunions in heavy metal history . " Rivadavia expressed that Duplantier " generally just keeps a low sonic profile and his nose out of trouble , but Rizzo 's contributions really can 't be overstated . [ ... ] His otherworldly soloing and inventive melodic lines often serve as the creative catalysts responsible for the most inspired moments . " Keith Carman of Exclaim ! praised the group 's musicianship on Inflikted , saying that " it wouldn 't be a stretch to proclaim that Inflikted , with its detuned grunt , bombastic lyrics and hyperactive drumming , is the album that should have succeeded Sepultura 's widely @-@ acclaimed 1996 powerhouse Roots . " Like the former , Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote enthusiastically for both Cavalera Conspiracy and Inflikted . 
 Sure , it 's not a Sepultura reunion , but having Max and Igor performing on record for the first time in a dozen years is as close as we 'll ever get , and not only does Cavalera Conspiracy 's Inflikted revisit the post @-@ thrash sounds of 1993 's Chaos A.D. , but it manages to outshine anything Sepultura has put out in the last dozen years . Rounded out by Soulfly lead guitarist Marc Rizzo and , most impressively , Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier on bass and rhythm guitar , the band is as solid a metal supergroup as you 'll ever come across , and the album 's eleven tracks benefit hugely from the chemistry between the four musicians . 
 Joel McIver of Record Collector wrote : " Inflikted is <unk> violent . The 11 tracks combine hardcore punk ( without the crappy production ) and thrash metal ( without the clichés ) to produce an insanely fast record loaded with references to their best work : Sepultura ’ s Beneath the Remains and Arise . It ’ s too modern to sound close to those records , of course , but in terms of attitude and riff weight it matches them beat @-@ for @-@ beat and riff @-@ for @-@ riff . Those thousands praying for the Max @-@ era Sepultura line @-@ up to reform can get off their knees : the key reunion has happened . "

 Green was born in Paris , France , two minutes earlier than her fraternal twin sister , Joy ( Johanne ) . She is the daughter of Marlène Jobert , an actress , and Walter Green , a dentist . ( Her father Walter has acted in film , appearing in Robert Bresson 's film Au Hasard Balthazar . ) Her father is of Swedish and French descent , and through him she is the great @-@ granddaughter of the French composer Paul Le Flem . Her mother , a native of French Algeria , later moved to Metropolitan France . Green is Jewish , as is her mother ( of Sephardi Jewish heritage ) . However , she was not raised religious at all ; she has said " I feel like a citizen of the world . Life and cinema don 't have borders . " Green has described her family as " bourgeois " , and has said that her sister is very different from her . Green is a natural dark blonde ; she has dyed her hair black since she was 15 years old . The French @-@ Swedish actress Marika Green is her aunt . The 1980s pop @-@ star Elsa <unk> is her first cousin , through their mothers . 
 Green was raised in France and attended the American University of Paris , an English @-@ speaking institution . She also spent time between Ramsgate , London and Ireland growing up . Green was quiet in school , and developed an interest in Egyptology when she visited the Louvre at age seven . At age 14 , after seeing Isabelle Adjani in The Story of Adele H. , Green decided to become an actress . Her mother initially feared that an acting career would be too much for her sensitive daughter , but later came to support young Eva 's ambitions . Green continued her studies at St. Paul Drama School in Paris , and took an acting course at Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London . Around this time , Green returned to Paris , where she performed in several plays . Green stated that in drama school , " I always picked the really evil roles . It 's a great way to deal with your everyday emotions . " 
 = = Career = = 
 Green appeared on stage in <unk> en Trois Fax ( 2001 ) for which she was nominated for a Molière Award . She also appeared in <unk> ( 2002 ) . 
 In 2002 , Green had her film debut , when director Bernardo Bertolucci cast her for the role of Isabelle in The Dreamers ( 2003 ) , which involved her in extensive full frontal nude scenes and graphic sex scenes . Green told The Guardian that her agent and her parents begged her not to take the role , concerned that the film would cause her career to " have the same destiny as Maria Schneider " , because of Schneider 's traumatic experience during the filming of Bertolucci 's Last Tango in Paris . Green said that with Bertolucci 's guidance she felt comfortable during the filming of the nude and sex scenes but was embarrassed when her family saw the film . Her performance was well @-@ received , and some compared her to Liv Tyler . Green expressed surprise when a minute was cut from the film for the American market , stating , " [ T ] here is so much violence , both on the streets and on the screen . They think nothing of it . Yet I think they are frightened by sex . " Her next film was Arsène Lupin ( 2004 ) , in which she portrayed Lupin 's love interest . She enjoyed the light @-@ hearted role , although she has stated that she generally prefers more complex characters . 
 Her performance in The Dreamers led Ridley Scott to cast Green in Kingdom of Heaven ( 2005 ) , a film about the Crusades where she played Sibylla of Jerusalem . Green performed six screen tests and was hired only a week before principal photography began . Green found the atmosphere of coming onto a film so late tense and exciting , and she liked the film 's ambiguity in approaching its subject matter . To her disappointment , much of her screen time was cut . Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised her performance : " She doesn 't quite know what to do with her character 's stilted dialogue , but she carries herself so regally that you barely notice . " Nev Pierce of the BBC , however , called her character " limp " . Green was satisfied when her character 's complex subplot was restored in the director 's cut . Total Film said the new scenes completed her performance : " In the theatrical cut , Princess Sibylla sleeps with Balian and then , more or less , loses her mind . Now we understand why . Not only does Sibylla have a young son , but when she realizes he 's afflicted with leprosy just like her brother Baldwin , she decides to take his life shortly after he 's been crowned king . " 
 Green was considered for roles in The Constant Gardener ( a role that went to Rachel Weisz ) and The Black Dahlia . She was cast at the last minute for the role of Vesper Lynd in the James Bond film Casino Royale ( 2006 ) . Green was approached in mid @-@ 2005 but turned it down . Principal photography was already underway , and director Martin Campbell said casting the role was difficult because " we didn 't have the final script and a Bond girl always had the connotation of tits ' n ' ass . " Campbell saw Green 's performance in the director 's cut of Kingdom of Heaven , and approached Green again . She read the script , and found the character of Vesper far deeper than most Bond girls . Green 's performance was well received : Entertainment Weekly called her the fourth @-@ best Bond girl of all time ; IGN named her the best femme fatale , stating , " This is the girl that broke – and therefore made – James Bond " ; and she won a BAFTA and an Empire award for her performance . Both awards were voted for by the British public . 
 Green portrayed the witch <unk> <unk> in the 2007 film adaptation of The Golden Compass . She found it difficult being flown on a harness because of her fear of heights , which led her to refuse to reshoot a scene on her last day of filming . Green hoped the religious themes of the book would be preserved , but references to Catholicism were removed from the film . Green next appeared in Franklyn , as Emilia , a woman whose multiple personalities are split between tormented artist ( which Green compared to real @-@ life figures Sophie Calle and Tracey Emin ) and another , which she described as , " full of life , very witty , big sense of humor " . She also filmed Cracks , the directorial debut of Jordan Scott , Ridley Scott 's daughter , where she plays a mysterious teacher at a girls ' school named Miss G , who falls in love with one of her pupils . In March 2009 , she appeared in Womb , where she plays a woman who clones her dead boyfriend . It is a collaboration between actor Matt Smith and director <unk> <unk> . 
 She was considered for the role eventually played by Cécile de France in Un Secret ( 2007 ) . Additionally , she was initially approached for the female lead in Lars von Trier 's controversial film Antichrist ( 2009 ) . According to Trier , Green was positive about appearing in the film , but her agents refused to allow her . The unsuccessful casting attempt took two months of the film 's pre @-@ production process . Anglo @-@ French actress Charlotte Gainsbourg was subsequently cast in the role . Green later told she got along well with Trier , " but then we started talking about nudity and sex and so on . It got a bit too far ... It was my dream to work with him , but it ’ s a shame it was on that film that it nearly happened . I ’ m sure I would have been trashed doing that film " . 
 Green starred in the first season of Starz 's series , Camelot , as the sorceress Morgan le Fay . Green stated , " This is such an iconic story and you have 10 episodes to explore a character . It 's not a girlfriend role that you could have in a movie . It 's a real ballsy character . She has some guts . " In 2012 , Green played a vengeful witch Angelique Bouchard who curses Johnny Depp 's character into a vampire in Tim Burton 's Dark Shadows . In 2014 , she played Artemisia in the 300 sequel , 300 : Rise of an Empire . Since May 2014 , Green starred in the Showtime series Penny Dreadful as Vanessa Ives .

 Green has expressed interest in returning to the theatre .

 American songwriter and producer Christopher " Tricky " Stewart convened with Terius " The @-@ Dream " Nash and Kuk Harrell in January 2007 at the Atlanta @-@ based Triangle Studios to create new material . In the studio , Stewart was " messing around with a walloping hi @-@ hat sound " , which he found in the free music software GarageBand , which is included in all Mac computers . With his attention caught by the sound , Nash asked Stewart what he was doing : " Oh , my Gosh , what is that beat ? " . When Stewart incorporated chords onto the hi @-@ hat , " immediately the word popped into [ Nash 's ] head " ; he went to the vocal booth and started singing . Nash wrote the first two verses and the chorus over Stewart 's skeleton track . They quickly wrote the lyrics , completing the first verse in 60 seconds . They continued into writing , adding the hook while " [ Stewart ] would put the next chord " . In a matter of hours , they had recorded a demo of the track . The song was written with American pop singer Britney Spears in mind , whom Stewart had previously worked with on her 2003 single " Me Against the Music " . Stewart and Nash thought that Spears , who had " her personal life ... a little out of control " at the time , needed a hit as musical comeback . Spears was working on her fifth album , Blackout , so they sent a copy of the demo to Spears ' management . However , Spears did not hear of the song because her label rejected it , claiming they had enough songs for her to record . 
 Following the management 's rejection of the track , Stewart and Nash dealt it out to other record labels . It was also given to English singer @-@ songwriter Taio Cruz , who failed to convince his record company to release it . It was then opted by Island Def Jam chairman Antonio " L.A. " Reid , a friend of Stewart who established his first studio . By early February 2007 , the demo was sent to Reid 's right @-@ hand woman , A & R executive Karen Kwak , who passed it along to Reid with a message confirming that they had found a song suited for Rihanna , who was working on her third studio album , Good Girl Gone Bad , at the time . Reid immediately sent the demo to Rihanna , who was also positive of it : " When the demo first started playing , I was like , This is interesting , this is weird . ... But the song kept getting better . I listened to it over and over . I said , ' I need this record . I want to record it tomorrow . " 
 However , since it was the Grammy season of 2007 , Stewart and Nash eyed American R & B singer Mary J. Blige for the demo . Upon calling them to set the record aside for Rihanna , Stewart had played it to an associate of Blige , subsequently promising the song to her . Having heard the move of the writers , Kwak began calling Stewart and his manager , Mark Stewart , incessantly . Meanwhile , considering Blige 's nominations at the Grammys , Stewart and Nash agreed to wait for her response . However , Blige failed to hear the song in full due to her obligations to the Grammys at the time and " had to sign off on the record before her reps could accept it " . Finally , Reid " stepped in , trading on his power @-@ broker status and longstanding relationship with Stewart " , and admits , " I made the producers an offer they couldn 't refuse . " By the time Reid had successfully persuaded Stewart 's camp , they " just couldn 't say no " . On giving up the record to Reid 's camp , Mark Stewart comments , " We knew Rihanna 's album would be out in a few months . Mary wasn 't even in an album cycle yet . We made the sensible business decision . " 
 Rihanna recorded the song , with vocal production by <unk> " Kuk " Harrell , in a Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles . Initially , Stewart admitted he was still reluctant as to whether Rihanna was the right artist to record the song , but following the recording of the " ella , ella " catch phrase , he felt they were onto " something " . Following Rihanna 's recording , Def Jam CEO @-@ rapper Jay @-@ Z added his rap . However , Jay @-@ Z rewrote his verse without the awareness of Stewart and Nash . Stewart could not understand it , but later realized it made " sense " instead of the first version . Stewart noted that " from a songwriter 's standpoint , he just really made it more about the song , with the metaphors about umbrellas and about the weather versus what he had before " . 
 " Umbrella " was released worldwide on March 29 , 2007 , debuting on Rihanna 's Def Jam website . The song was released digitally in the United Kingdom on May 14 , 2007 , along with its physical release following two weeks later .

 Andy Kellman of AllMusic commented : " ' Umbrella ' is [ Rihanna 's best song ] to date , delivering mammoth if spacious drums , a towering backdrop during the chorus , and vocals that are somehow totally convincing without sounding all that impassioned - an ideal spot between trying too hard and boredom , like she might 've been on her 20th take . " Alex Macpherson of British newspaper The Guardian , " Umbrella " is " evidence " that Rihanna 's " strict work ethic is paying off " , adding that she " delivers [ in the song ] an impassioned declaration of us @-@ against @-@ the @-@ world devotion " . Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media , though he complimented the production , dismissed Rihanna 's voice which " takes on an unpleasant icepick edge when she tries to fill the space between the slow @-@ tempo beats " , adding that the song is " <unk> as event @-@ pop , particularly because of the disconnect between Rihanna 's cold , clinical delivery and the comforting warmth of the lyrics " . 
 Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote " That the song is just plain good , regardless of genre , proves that Jay and Rihanna , who 's already scored hits across several formats with a string of singles that couldn 't be more different from each other , are dedicated to producing quality hits — however frivolous they may be . " Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters.com said that " " Umbrella " is a monster , so much so that I 'll even confess to spending a portion of a rainy afternoon practicing the hook . " Jonah Weiner of Blender magazine called the song the album 's highlight and stated that it " would be far less engrossing if it wasn 't for the way Rihanna disassembles its ungainly title into 11 hypnotic , tongue @-@ flicking syllables " . The New York Times ' Kelefa Sanneh described the song as " a space @-@ age hip @-@ pop song " .

 While working on the album , ideas began to circulate concerning Rihanna 's image , extending into her music videos .

Makeup artist Pamela Neal mixed a silver paint that would give Rihanna such a look . During the session , the paint was re @-@ applied between takes to ensure she was completely covered . The set was closed to Rihanna , Applebaum and a camera assistant .

 The song 's reign at number one in the United Kingdom occurred as the country was hit by extreme rainfall and flooding , which led the British national newspaper The Sun to humorously suggest the two events were related , with the media referring to it as the " Rihanna Curse .

 Ford Island ( Hawaiian : Poka <unk> ) is an islet in the center of Pearl Harbor , Oahu , in the U.S. state of Hawaii . It has been known as Rabbit Island , Marín 's Island , and Little Goats Island , and its native Hawaiian name is <unk> . The island had an area of 334 acres ( 135 ha ) when it was surveyed in 1825 , which was increased during the 1930s to 441 acres ( 178 ha ) with fill dredged out of Pearl Harbor by the United States Navy to accommodate battleships . 
 It was the site of an ancient Hawaiian fertility ritual , which was stopped by Christian missionaries during the 1830s . The island was given by Kamehameha I to Spanish deserter Francisco de Paula Marín , and later returned to the monarchy . After the island was bought at auction by James Isaac Dowsett and sold to Caroline Jackson , it became the property of Dr. Seth Porter Ford by marriage and was renamed Ford Island . After Ford 's death , his son sold the island to the John Papa ʻĪʻī estate and it was converted into a sugarcane plantation . 
 In 1916 , part of Ford Island was sold to the U.S. Army for use by an aviation division in Hawaii , and by 1939 it was taken over by the U.S. Navy as a station for battleship and submarine maintenance . From the 1910s to the 1940s , the island continued to grow as a strategic center of operations for the U.S. Navy in the Pacific Ocean . Ford Island was at the center of the attack on Pearl Harbor and on the U.S. Pacific Fleet by the Japanese fleet on December 7 , 1941 . It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964 , and as of 2011 the National Trust for Historic Preservation has listed the island as one of the United States ' most @-@ endangered historic sites . 
 By the late 1990s , hundreds of millions of dollars had been invested in real estate development and infrastructure , including a new bridge . Ford Island continues to serve an active role in the Pacific , hosting military functions at the Pacific Warfighting Center and civilian functions at NOAA 's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center . The island has been featured in films such as Tora ! Tora ! Tora ! and Pearl Harbor and receives tourists from the U.S. and abroad at the USS Arizona memorial and the USS Missouri museum . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Ford Island is located inside Pearl Harbor , South Oʻahu of the Hawaiian Islands . Pearl Harbor is divided into three large bodies of water called the West Loch , Middle Loch and East Loch with Ford Island in the center of the East Loch . It is 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) long and 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 21 km ) wide , and was enlarged from 334 to 441 acres ( 135 to 178 ha ) between 1930 and 1940 with land fill dredged from the surrounding harbor . The land is a relatively flat plain rising from 5 to 15 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 to 4 @.@ 6 m ) above mean water level , and slopes toward Pearl Harbor . It connects to the larger island of Oʻahu , surrounding Pearl Harbor , via a 4 @,@ 672 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 424 m ) bridge at its northern tip which crosses east to Halawa Landing . 
 The island 's soil is composed primarily of volcanic material , lagoonal deposits and coralline debris , with silty sand from the dredging . Its volcanic material is Aeolian ash , weathered tuff and basalt . Ford Island proper is a coral outcrop . There are two smaller islets near the island : <unk> and <unk> . 
 = = = Contamination = = = 
 In 1991 , the Navy discovered nine metals , two semi @-@ volatile organic compounds and a polychlorinated biphenyl in Ford Island 's soil , groundwater and marine sediment . Suspected sources were nine 225 @,@ 000 @-@ US @-@ gallon ( 850 @,@ 000 l ; 187 @,@ 000 imp gal ) fuel tanks on the east @-@ central side of the island ( from 1924 to 1954 ) , a 4 @.@ 4 @-@ acre ( 1 @.@ 8 ha ) landfill on the southwestern shore ( from 1930 to 1960 ) and ordnance bunkers on the northeastern side . An investigation suggested covering the contaminated areas with clean soil . In 1994 , the Navy considered removing the contaminated soil and installed six wells to monitor groundwater , but decided to follow the original recommendation in 1995 and capped the contaminated soil with topsoil and erosion @-@ resistant vegetation ( including Bermuda grass ) . The containment system was completed in 1996 . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 The wildlife on Ford Island is likely very similar to that on Naval Station Pearl Harbor . Wildlife is sparse and dominated by invasive species such as the house mouse , mongoose , brown rat , black rat , house sparrow , Java sparrow and common <unk> . An endangered owl , the endemic <unk> ( a subspecies of the short @-@ eared owl ) , has been seen hunting on the island . Nearly all the plant life on the island is non @-@ native , including edible cacti from California introduced in the late 1700s by Francisco de Paula Marín . The island 's harbor was important to ancient Hawaiians for its ample supply of fish , including mullet , milkfish and Hawaiian anchovy . The National Park Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service oversee and administer the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument battlefields at Pearl Harbor and Ford Island .

 Ancient Hawaiians called the island <unk> ( " isle of attraction " or " island of strife " ) , after the ceremony ( ʻume ) held during the <unk> festival for married couples who were having difficulty conceiving children . In the Hawaiian language the word <unk> means to cut or sever in two , as well as an island or inlet . The word ʻume means to draw , attract or entice and was used to name the ceremony for the common people . Hawaii historian Herb <unk> Kāne considered ʻume to be a courtship game . Those selected for ʻume ( never virgins or the unmarried ) would sing around a large bonfire while a tribal leader with a <unk> ( wand ) chanted , touching individual men and women . Those who were touched would find a secluded part of the island to have sex . Husbands and wives were not paired , and jealousy was discouraged . Children born of these unions were considered children of the husband , not the biological father . By 1830 , this activity was forbidden by Christian missionaries . 
 The native Hawaiian people of the area were called Ke <unk> o <unk> . They used the island to cultivate watermelon and to harvest pili grass for the construction of thatched roofs . According to Hawaiian legend , the goddess <unk> killed a girl on the island ; remorseful , she then proclaimed a law forbidding further killing . <unk> @-@ <unk> 's brother <unk> ( sometimes referred to by historians as her son , Ku @-@ <unk> ) was said to live in an underwater cavern off Ford Island with <unk> , a giant water lizard which supplied food to the people of <unk> Beach .

 Although no historical records provide an exact date , researchers at the Hawaiian Historical Society believe that the island was given to Francisco de Paula Marín on February 9 , 1818 , and later named after him for his assistance in providing weapons used by Kamehameha I to conquer the island of Oʻahu . However , Marín wrote in an 1809 journal entry that he was given the island and its adjacent fishing waters as early as 1791 . He used the land to raise sheep , hogs , goats and rabbits as provisions for ships , and grew plants and vegetables which he had imported . 
 In 1825 , Admiral George Byron , the 7th Baron Byron arrived , commanding the HMS Blonde , to return the remains of Kamehameha II and Queen Kamāmalu after their deaths in England of Measles . While on Oahu , he would map the Pearl River ( known today as Pearl Harbor ) . The ship 's naturalist , Andrew Bloxam , spent time on Ford Island hunting rabbits and wild ducks ; its surveyor , Lieutenant Charles Robert Malden , called it Rabbits Island . In 1826 , Hiram Paulding became the first American naval officer to visit the island . Marín 's ownership claim to the island was cloudy ; Hawaiians generally refused to recognize land ownership by foreigners . Kamehameha II believed that the island had been loaned to Marín and by the 1850s the island was split between Kamehameha IV — who purchased 214 acres ( 87 ha ) — and High <unk> <unk> , granddaughter of Kamehameha I , who was awarded 147 acres ( 59 ha ) in the Great <unk> . On August 28 , 1865 , the island was bought at public auction for $ 1 @,@ 040 by James I. Dowsett , who sold it to Caroline Jackson for $ 1 on December 28 . 
 Dr. Seth Porter Ford arrived in 1851 from Boston , and practiced medicine at the U.S. Seamen 's Hospital . Ford married Caroline Jackson in June 1866 , taking control of the island and changing its name from Marín Island to Ford Island . When Ford died in 1866 , it was transferred to his son , Seth Porter Ford , Jr . The island was managed by Sanford B. Dole on behalf of Ford 's minor children until Ford , Jr. came of age and sold the island in 1891 to the John Papa ʻĪʻī land trust . 
 = = = Sugar reciprocity = = = 
 Sugar had been a major export from Hawaii since Captain James Cook 's arrival in 1778 . During the 1850s , the U.S. import tariff on sugar from Hawaii was much higher than the import tariffs Hawaiians were charging the U.S. , and Kamehameha III sought reciprocity . 
 As early as 1873 , a United States military commission recommended attempting to obtain Ford Island in exchange for the tax @-@ free importation of sugar to the U.S. At that time Major General John Schofield , U.S. commander of the military division of the Pacific , and Brevet Brigadier General Burton S. Alexander arrived in Hawaii to ascertain its defensive capabilities . U.S. control of Hawaii was considered vital for the defense of the west coast of the United States , and they were especially interested in Pu <unk> , Pearl Harbor . The sale of one of Hawaii 's harbors was proposed by Charles Reed Bishop , a foreigner who had married into the Kamehameha family , had risen in the government to be Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs , and owned a country home near Pu <unk> . He showed the two U.S. officers around the lochs , although his wife , Bernice Pauahi Bishop , privately disapproved of selling Hawaiian lands . As monarch , William Charles Lunalilo , was content to let Bishop run almost all business affairs but the ceding of lands would become unpopular with the native Hawaiians . Many islanders thought that all the islands , rather than just Pearl Harbor , might be lost and opposed any cession of land . By November 1873 , Lunalilo canceled negotiations and returned to drinking , against his doctor 's advice ; his health declined swiftly , and he died on February 3 , 1874 . 
 Lunalilo left no heirs . The legislature was empowered by the constitution to elect the monarch in these instances and chose David Kalākaua as the next monarch . The new ruler was pressured by the U.S. government to surrender Pearl Harbor to the Navy . Kalākaua was concerned that this would lead to annexation by the U.S. and to the contravening of the traditions of the Hawaiian people , who believed that the land ( ' <unk> ) was fertile , sacred , and not for sale to anyone . In 1875 , the United States Congress agreed to an additional seven years of reciprocity in exchange for Ford Island . At the end of the seven @-@ year reciprocity agreement , the United States showed little interest in renewal . 
 On January 20 , 1887 , the United States began leasing Pearl Harbor . Shortly afterwards , a group of mostly non @-@ Hawaiians calling themselves the Hawaiian Patriotic League began the Rebellion of 1887 . They drafted their own constitution on July 6 , 1887 . The new constitution was written by Lorrin Thurston , the Hawaiian Minister of the Interior who used the Hawaiian militia as threat against Kalākaua . Kalākaua was forced to dismiss his cabinet ministers and sign a new constitution which greatly lessened his power . It would become known as the " Bayonet Constitution " due to the force used . 
 With support from California ( because the state had profited from the import of sugar ) , Kalākaua again approached Congress . When the United States still seemed uninterested in reciprocity , he threatened to forge more favorable export agreements with Australia or New Zealand . Congress feared that a treaty between Hawaii and Australia or New Zealand would result in annexation by one of those countries instead of the United States . Although Kalākaua was loath to give any foreign country land in Hawaii , he signed the treaty in September 1887 . 
 The Oahu Sugar Company ( also known as the Oahu Sugar Cane Plantation ) leased about 300 acres ( 120 ha ) from the John Papa ʻĪʻī estate ( after their purchase of the island in 1891 ) to harvest sugar in 1899 . The business was successful , and the company sublet land from Benjamin Dillingham on the <unk> 'o peninsula ( southeast of present <unk> ) to build a 12 @-@ roller mill and railroad . Sugarcane was grown and harvested on Ford Island with a network of aqueducts from freshwater reservoirs , transported to <unk> by barge and then by rail to the mills . 
 In 1902 , the nearby estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop lost a crucial lawsuit brought by the United States to purchase land around Pearl Harbor for below its market value . Although the Bishop estate valued the land at $ 600 per acre , the United States was only willing to pay $ 30 per acre . A jury determined that the land would be sold to the United States at $ 75 per acre . Facing a similar lawsuit and interest in its land on Ford Island , the John Papa ʻĪʻī estate settled with the United States to deed twenty @-@ five acres at no cost . In exchange , the U.S. dropped its suit for the entire island . 
 The military leased sections of the north and south sides of the island — 25 @.@ 83 acres ( 10 @.@ 45 ha ) for $ 3 @,@ 000 — from the John Papa ʻĪʻī estate to build 6 @-@ inch ( 15 cm ) gun batteries : Battery Boyd and Battery Henry Adair . In 1917 , the John Papa ʻĪʻī estate agreed to sell part of the Island to the United States for construction of an airfield , despite the Oahu Sugar Company complaining in court that the sale would hurt their business .

 In 1917 , the 6th Aero Squadron was created in Honolulu , with Captain John F. Currey as its commander . Although 50 were assigned , only 49 arrived ; one deserted en route . Currey chose Ford Island as the location for the new squadron and bought it from the John Papa ʻĪʻī land trust for $ 236 @,@ 000 , citing its access to water and winds as assets . When Currey was transferred to Washington , command of the squadron was given to Captain John B. Brooks and then Major Hugh J. <unk> , who built hangars and a runway . Early soldiers had to level the island , removing hills and boulders . 
 All housing and major hangars were completed in 1918 , including a large steel @-@ and @-@ wood hangar , two concrete hangars for seaplanes and flying boats , a supply warehouse , a machine shop , a photography laboratory and a powerhouse . In 1919 , the field was named Luke Field after Frank Luke , a World War I ace and Medal of Honor recipient . The U.S. Army 's introduction of aviation to Ford Island triggered expansion throughout Hawaii with the development of civilian airports , the creation of the Hawaii chapter of the National Aeronautic Association , and a national flying code . The army 's aviation division was generally favorably received by the Hawaiians , who took the military 's investment in their land as a compliment . 
 The Navy decided that a Hawaiian base was a necessity , considering the Army field at Ford Island an ideal candidate . Naval Air Station Pearl Harbor , consisting of nine officers and fifty @-@ five men , was commissioned on December 19 , 1919 . Although the Navy attempted to displace the Army from the island and designate it solely for naval use , U.S. Secretary of War Newton D. Baker divided the island equally between the military branches . The Army received the west side of the island , and the Navy the southeastern side . Lieutenant Commander Robert D. Kirk @-@ Patrick was sent to establish a naval station on the island with four airplanes and fifty @-@ five men . Kirk @-@ Patrick 's men had two Curtiss <unk> flying boats and two N @-@ 9 planes salvaged from World War I , which they stored in two large canvas hangars across the harbor from the island . After the naval hangars were commissioned on January 17 , 1923 , by Lieutenant Commander John Rodgers , the detachment moved onto Ford Island and received Naval Aircraft Factory TS , Felixstowe <unk> , Curtiss H @-@ 16 , Keystone PK @-@ 1 and Douglas DT type aircraft . To accommodate ship berthing the Navy built a concrete @-@ and @-@ stone quay around the entire island , and in 1926 , they received Vought FU , Vought VE @-@ 7 and Vought VE @-@ 9 biplanes . 
 During the 1930s , the Navy contracted a $ 1 @.@ 5 million dredging of Pearl Harbor to allow larger battleships and the fleet 's carriers to enter it . Work began in May 1940 resulting in 13 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 9 @,@ 900 @,@ 000 m3 ) of material dredged from the opening of Pearl Harbor to build a channel to Ford Island as well as to create a turning channel around the island . Material was also dredged to deepen the West Loch , East Loch , and Middle Loch for the mooring of battleships . With dredged material used as land fill , the island 's size was increased from 334 acres ( 135 ha ) to 441 acres ( 178 ha ) . 
 The Navy replaced its PK , <unk> , and <unk> aircraft with newer models ( see table below ) . In 1933 VP @-@ 8F arrived on station , and in 1935 the army bombers had become too large to be maintained and stored at Luke Field . Construction began on a new Army airfield , Hickam Army Airfield , named after pioneer U.S. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Colonel Horace Meek Hickam . From 1936 to 1940 Pan American flew its Clipper service into Ford Island , using it as a refueling stop between the United States and Asia . The Navy built a $ 25 @,@ 000 boathouse , spent $ 579 @,@ 565 on a new crew barracks and built a firehouse , water @-@ supply and lighting systems . In June 1936 the Navy lengthened the island 's landing field by 400 feet ( 120 m ) , to 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) . In March 1937 Amelia Earhart , on her second visit to Luke Field , crashed her Lockheed Electra on takeoff . 
 In 1939 , after three years of construction , Hickam Field opened . The Army transferred its operations there , leaving Luke Field under Navy control . The latter was renamed Naval Air Station Ford Island , and became the headquarters of Patrol Wing 2 ; its former namesake was re @-@ honored with a new base , Luke Air Force Base in Arizona . A September 8 , 1939 , presidential emergency proclamation spurred the rapid construction of new facilities to prepare the island for additional operations . This included additional barracks , a new assembly and repair hangar , an administration building , a dispensary , a control tower , a laundry and a theater . At the height of World War II , over 40 @,@ 000 people lived or worked on the island .

 Beginning in the 1930s , Imperial Japan attempted to expand its territory into China . Opposed to these aggressive actions , the United States , Britain , and the Netherlands froze Japanese assets and imposed economic restrictions which prohibited the exportation of aircraft fuel as well as steel and iron to Japan , affecting 90 % of Japan 's war production needs . Japan was forced to either give up its expansion plans or find alternative raw materials to continue producing equipment for the war . Japan chose to continue with its plans , but decided it needed to neutralize any threat from the United States first . 
 Ford Island ( in the center of Pearl Harbor ) was the headquarters of Patrol Wing Two , an important target for the first @-@ wave airborne raiders in the December 7 , 1941 , Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . Before dawn , the U.S. strategic center in the Pacific consisted of the seven battleships moored along Battleship Row and the six pairs of interrupted quays along the east side of Ford Island . Quay F @-@ 2 ( the southernmost ) , which usually berthed an aircraft carrier , was empty . The Pacific Fleet flagship California was moored northeastward , at F @-@ 3 . Side by side with the Maryland was Oklahoma ( outboard ) , followed by Tennessee with West Virginia outboard . Behind Tennessee was Arizona alongside the repair ship Vestal . Closing the row was Nevada , alone at F @-@ 8 . These battleships , from eighteen to twenty @-@ five years old , represented all but two of those available to the Pacific Fleet . Pennsylvania was also in Pearl Harbor , being dry @-@ docked at the Navy Yard . The ninth battleship of the fleet , Colorado , was being overhauled on the West Coast . These nine battleships taken together were one short of equaling Japan 's active battle fleet , although most of the Japanese vessels were newer . 
 The initial bombs struck the island at 07 : 57 local time , prompting the historic dispatch : " Air Raid , Pearl Harbor — this is no drill . " The battleships ringing Ford Island were the Japanese attackers ' primary targets . Twenty @-@ four of the forty Japanese torpedo planes were assigned to attack Battleship Row , and five more came over to that side of Ford Island after failing to find battleships in other parts of the harbor . The planes carried 29 Type 91 aerial torpedoes , each with a high @-@ explosive payload of 450 pounds ( 200 kg ) , of which 12 are thought to have found their targets : two in California , one in Nevada and a possible total of nine in Oklahoma and West Virginia ; the latter two ships sank within minutes of being hit . 
 Horizontal bomber aircraft delivering armor @-@ piercing bombs attacked as the last torpedo planes finished , and other horizontal and dive bombers came in later . The aircraft registered many direct hits and damaging near @-@ misses , including two each on California , Maryland and Tennessee and several more on West Virginia . 
 A bomb meant for the California hit Hangar 6 on the island , igniting it . Additional bombs hit Hangar 38 ( a dud ) , the dispensary courtyard ( leaving a large crater ) and the road outside the repair @-@ and @-@ assembly hangar . Only one man , Theodore Wheeler Croft , was killed on the island while standing guard duty . 
 The bombers ' most notable success was Arizona . A bomb exploded near the forward magazines , triggering a catastrophic explosion which immediately sank the ship . The island 's freshwater supply was cut off when the Arizona severed the main water line and the auxiliary line was destroyed at the Pearl Harbor end . The Nevada , which eventually got underway while under attack , was hit repeatedly by dive bombers who spotted a ship escaping from Ford Island . So she would not sink between the island and the Navy Yard ( blocking the entire harbor ) , Nevada was run aground . 
 Several planes from the aircraft carrier Enterprise , near Hawaii after a mission to Wake Island , arrived in the midst of the attack ; four were shot down by American air @-@ defense friendly fire . H. L. Young , commander of Enterprise air group , attempted to man the control tower to provide communications between the island , Enterprise , and the planes . However , he reported that although he attempted to communicate with Enterprise by radio from Ford Island , the communications systems there were inadequate , and he attributed the friendly fire to ineffective radio communications . After attempting to notify as many ships and anti @-@ aircraft batteries as possible , several planes from Enterprise and others from Ford Island 's complement were again airborne within hours to search for the attackers . Some of these search planes were again shot down on their return by friendly fire from the Ford Island defense , which was on high alert . 
 In addition to Battleship Row and the island 's naval field , the fixed moorings on the western side of Ford Island ( capable of securing battleships or aircraft carriers ) were high @-@ priority targets . Just west of the island , the seaplane tender Curtiss was hit by a crashing dive bomber , a bomb and fragments of another bomb . She was then unsuccessfully attacked by a Japanese midget submarine , which fired a torpedo before being sunk by the destroyer Monaghan . Hangar 6 and several patrol seaplanes and other aircraft on Ford Island ( 33 out of 70 of the island 's planes ) were destroyed . 
 = = = = Aftermath = = = = 
 The Japanese disabled all seven battleships on Battleship Row . Maryland , Tennessee and Pennsylvania were repaired in only a few weeks and three others within a year , but Oklahoma and Arizona were total losses . The weakened state of the US Pacific Fleet would allow the Japanese Navy to hold the initiative until the Guadalcanal Campaign eight months later . 
 Enterprise launched aircraft to patrol Ford Island and search for Japanese carriers . Five American pilots returning from missions to hunt down the Japanese fleet were mistakenly shot down by Ford Island anti @-@ aircraft gunners while attempting to land . The island 's commanding officer said about the friendly @-@ fire losses , " Somebody let fly and I never saw so many bullets in the air in my life and never expect to ... all tracer bullets at night . " 
 After the attack , ROTC cadets from the University of Hawaii were assigned to active duty guarding strategic buildings . Because of the island 's lack of fresh water and electric power to the dispensary , a temporary hospital had to be set up at the # 2 barracks . The island 's gasoline tank was emptied and refilled with water ; trenches were dug , and buildings camouflaged . Its runway was cleared of over three tons of scrap metal in two hours . The Marines who had picked up rifles for guard duty were tasked with feeding and clothing the soldiers and sailors . Twenty prisoners from the island 's brig were marched to the Marine barracks and put to work without incident ; some received commuted sentences for their efforts . That evening , Hawaiians were instructed to observe an indoor blackout , stay off the telephone , keep extra buckets of water available for fighting fires and keep cars off the streets ( parking them on lawns , if necessary ) . 
 Sixty concrete revetments were constructed to protect aircraft from another attack , and the Navy laid down a 16 @-@ inch ( 410 mm ) water main from across the harbor . A new control tower was commissioned on May 1 , 1942 , and the Navy built bomb shelters and gas @-@ decontamination chambers . Due to the need for better control of the US Pacific Fleet , its headquarters moved to Ford Island . 
 During the next few weeks , the Navy set up twenty @-@ one large winches on the island to turn the Oklahoma upright so it could be re @-@ floated and patched before being scrapped . Coral was piled between the ship and the island so the ship would roll upright , instead of sliding toward the shore . Oklahoma sank during a mid @-@ Pacific storm while it was being towed to the scrapyard . Nevada , California , West Virginia and the minelayer USS Oglala were re @-@ floated and salvaged by the Navy . The entire salvage operation took 20 @,@ 000 man @-@ hours underwater and 5 @,@ 000 dives to recover human remains , weapons , ammunition and artifacts of historic or military importance .

 The US Pacific Fleet established the Fleet Intelligence Center , Pacific ( <unk> ) on Ford Island by 1955 as the Vietnam War escalated and an additional intelligence branch was needed in addition to the one in Guam . With little other use of the island , as naval and air operations were moved to facilities on the side of the Pearl Harbor previously owned by the Bishop estate , the Navy decommissioned Naval Air Station Ford Island in 1966 . The island continued to be controlled by the Navy as a sub @-@ component of Naval Air Station Pearl Harbor . 
 On February 20 , 1970 , the 4 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) runway at NALF Ford Island was opened to civilian flight training operations , primarily local Army , Navy , Air Force and Marine Corps flying clubs . Itinerant military helicopter training activities also continued at NALF Ford Island during this period . Hawaii ( which achieved statehood in 1959 ) contracted with the US Navy to allow touch @-@ and @-@ go landings until 1972 , when the airfield was opened to students making their first solo flights . The island 's use as a training center helped relieve congestion at nearby Honolulu International Airport . After its active @-@ duty commission on February 1 , 1973 the Third Fleet moved its headquarters to Ford Island , where it remained until its 1991 move to San Diego . The island remained home to Navy officers and several naval headquarters . 
 For the 12 @-@ month period ending March 4 , 1998 , the airport had 39 @,@ 992 aircraft operations , an average of 110 per day : 98 percent general aviation and two percent military . On July 1 , 1999 , all military and civilian general @-@ aviation activity at NALF Ford Island ended when NAS Barbers Point was closed in a BRAC action and became the present civilian <unk> Airport and Coast Guard Air Station Barbers Point . The new airport was open to general aviation and rendered NALF Ford Island redundant . 
 Before the completion of the Admiral Clarey Bridge , access to Ford Island was by ferry . Two diesel @-@ powered ferries , Waa Hele Honoa ( YFB @-@ 83 ) and Moko Holo Hele ( YFB @-@ 87 ) , served the island . The Waa Hele Honoa ( meaning " canoe go to land " ) was purchased in 1959 for $ 274 @,@ 000 , and pressed into service by the Navy on March 3 , 1961 . It is the older and larger of the two ferries , at 181 feet ( 55 m ) , with a capacity of 750 people and 33 vehicles . The other , Moko Holo Hele ( meaning " boat go back and forth " ) was purchased for $ 1 @.@ 1 million on May 25 , 1970 . At 162 feet ( 49 m ) , its capacity was 750 people and 42 vehicles . Both ferries were operated by US Navy personnel , and access to the island was restricted to US military personnel , their dependents and invited guests . In addition to the two car ferries , there were several smaller " foot ferries " allowing pedestrians to travel between Ford Island and alternate landings around Pearl Harbor . 
 = = = Rebirth = = = 
 Initially called " the bridge to nowhere " , the Admiral Clarey Bridge was instrumental in Senator Daniel Inouye 's " rebirth " of Ford Island and enabled over $ 500 million in development with special legislation ( 2814 US Code ) . It connected 45 families and 3 @,@ 000 civilian workers to Kamehameha Highway , and visitor access enabled construction of the $ 50 million 16 @-@ acre ( 6 @.@ 5 ha ) Pacific Aviation Museum . Plans included 500 homes for Navy personnel , a child @-@ development center and a Navy lodge . 
 In planning the island 's development , the Navy considered its operational needs and the island 's historic value . However , the National Trust for Historic Preservation considered the Navy 's communication style more directive rather than collaborative , restricting the <unk> 's ability to share their concerns , and in 2001 designated Ford Island one of its 11 most @-@ endangered sites . Although the Navy 's plans included preserving important hangars , the control tower and seaplane ramps , they failed to protect the existing runway and 1920s housing and did not address preserving bullet holes on the seaplane ramps . As hoped by the Trust , after the designation the Navy agreed to delay development of some of these items until an agreement could be reached . 
 To accommodate additional facilities and housing , the Navy needed to upgrade the island 's infrastructure . Its sewage system was upgraded with the 2001 installation of a 6 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) , 20 @-@ inch ( 510 mm ) sewage main from the island to Pearl Harbor and improvements to the sewage @-@ pumping station . Due to the bridge 's unique design , which includes a floating section , it was impossible to use it to transit cable across the loch . In 2005 , the Navy contracted drilling for primary and auxiliary conduits 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) apart and parallel to the bridge from Halawa Landing to the Ford Island golf course . The contractor installed 5 @,@ 045 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 538 m ) -long , 24 @-@ inch ( 610 mm ) -thick carbon @-@ steel high @-@ magnetic casing conduits , and fiber @-@ optic communications cables and <unk> power lines were fed through them . 
 In June 2013 the Navy planned to install 60 @,@ 000 photovoltaic panels over 28 acres ( 11 ha ) on the Ford Island runway , to comply with Congressional and Defense Department mandates to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and offset the cost of Hawaiian energy ( the highest in the United States ) . This plan deviated from a 2009 proposal ( using the panels to define the runway ) in favor of panels producing twice the power . The Navy offered the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor $ 250 @,@ 000 toward renovation of the control tower 's elevator in exchange for its support of the plan . The museum declined , organizing an internet campaign opposing the plan based on the runway 's historic significance and highlighting Ford Island 's role in the attack on Pearl Harbor and Amelia Earhart 's visit . In response , the Navy decided to install the panels on existing structures around Pearl Harbor .

 Ford Island continues to be used by the US Navy . It hosts the 34 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 3 @,@ 200 m2 ) Pacific Warfighting Center for exercises , training and battle simulations . The Admiral Clarey Bridge enabled the Navy to develop a $ 331 million Pacific tsunami warning center named after Senator Daniel Inouye , replacing the aging facility on <unk> Beach . The center 's location is controversial because of its location in a tsunami @-@ vulnerable area and the Navy 's tsunami @-@ evacuation plan calls for the island 's only access point — the Admiral Clarey Bridge — to be opened for ship evacuation ( making the bridge inaccessible to land vehicles ) . The island also continues to host a military brig . 
 Nominally based in Alaska , the Sea @-@ based X @-@ band Radar ( <unk> @-@ 1 ) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for maintenance and repairs and has returned several times since .

 = = Memorials and museums = = 
 Soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor , it was decided that the USS Arizona would remain at the bottom of the harbor as the final resting place for those lost . In 1958 , President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved the construction of a memorial over the vessel and the USS Arizona memorial was dedicated in 1962 . It includes a complex at Halawa Landing ( opposite Ford Island ) and a structure over the Arizona which receives visitors by ferry . Although the ferries are operated by US Navy personnel , the complex is staffed by the National Park Service . 
 In January 29 , 1964 , the navy facility in Pearl Harbor centering on the Ford Island was designated " United States Naval Base , Pearl Harbor " and became a National Historic Landmark . 
 The battleship USS Utah , which was actually a test dummy , remains submerged off the island . After salvaging the capsized USS Oklahoma with <unk> cables , the Navy unsuccessfully tried to recover the Utah using the same technique . In 1972 , the remains of the Utah ( on the northwest side of the island ) were dedicated as a memorial to the fifty @-@ eight men still inside . 
 Despite concern that it would detract from the Arizona memorial , in 1998 the USS Missouri was transferred from Washington State to Ford Island . After a year of conversion into a museum , the ship opened for visitors on January 29 , 1999 . On December 7 , 2006 , the 65th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor , the aviation museum opened to visitors in Hangar 37 after more than ten years of planning . On December 7 , 2007 , a joint ceremony was held by the National Park Service and the USS Oklahoma memorial committee to dedicate a memorial to the ship just outside the entrance to the USS Missouri museum on the northeast side of the island . The Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor signed a lease with the US Navy on September 2 , 2010 , for the Ford Island control tower , which sent the first radio alert of the attack , and began its restoration .

 A 1965 film , In Harm 's Way starring John Wayne , was filmed on Ford Island . A fictionalized scene before the attack , with officers and their wives at a pool party , was reenacted by island residents on the anniversary of the attacks as late as 2001 . In 1970 , the island 's control tower was repainted for the filming of Tora ! Tora ! Tora ! . A Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress used in the production experienced a landing @-@ gear malfunction and crash @-@ landed on Ford Island , and the crash landing was included in the film . 
 In April 2000 , filming began on the Michael Bay film Pearl Harbor . Before the filming , the cast and crew gathered on the USS Arizona memorial for a wreath @-@ laying by a representative of Touchstone Pictures , Jerry Bruckheimer and Bay . The producers brought fifteen vintage planes to Ford Island , placing them in one hangar for the filming . In addition , they brought fifteen ships back to Pearl Harbor for live bombardment ( without sinking them ) . The operations room of the control tower was converted into a barracks for the filming . The Pacific Aviation Museum hoped that the film would increase public awareness of the tower and spur support for its restoration . Bay reflected on the historic significance of Ford Island : " I have a vivid memory of showing the crew around Ford Island during pre @-@ production . We came upon a plaque directly across from the sunken Arizona , marking the spot where a torpedo hit nearly six decades ago . My crew stood in silence for three minutes at the sight of this small monument . It was a solemn moment for all of us , and I think it helped the crew appreciate the undertaking were [ sic ] about to begin . " During filming , a Vultee BT @-@ 13 Valiant used as a torpedo bomber crashed on the island . 
 In 2010 , the television series Hawaii Five @-@ 0 chose Battleship Cove , a housing community just outside the dock of the USS Missouri museum , as the location for an episode . The episode , with police cars racing down Tennessee and Nevada Streets , featured a number of Ford Island homes and some residents appeared as extras . That year , Peter Berg featured the USS Missouri in the film Battleship . The ship , which was towed off Ford Island for maintenance , was brought out to sea between completion of the maintenance and its return to the dock for filming . Michael Carr , president of the Battleship Missouri Memorial , hoped that the film would spike the number of visitors to the Ford Island museum .

 The Lion class were a class of battlecruisers built for the British Royal Navy before World War I. Nicknamed the " Splendid Cats " , the ships were a significant improvement over their predecessors of the Indefatigable class in terms of speed , armament and armour . The Lion @-@ class battlecruisers were 2 knots ( 3 @.@ 7 km / h ; 2 @.@ 3 mph ) faster , exchanged the 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns of the older ships for 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 343 mm ) guns , and had a waterline armour belt 9 inches ( 229 mm ) thick versus the 6 inches ( 152 mm ) of the Indefatigables . These improvements were in response to the German Moltke class , the first German battlecruisers , which were larger and more powerful than the first British battlecruisers of the Invincible class . 
 Lion served as the flagship of the Grand Fleet 's battlecruisers throughout World War I , except when she was being refitted or under repair . She sank the German light cruiser Cöln during the Battle of Heligoland Bight and served as Vice Admiral Beatty 's flagship at the battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland . She was so badly damaged at the first of these battles that she had to be towed back to port by the battlecruiser Indomitable and was under repair for more than two months . During the Battle of Jutland , Lion suffered a serious propellant fire that could have destroyed the ship if not for the action of Royal Marine Major Francis Harvey , the turret commander , who posthumously received the Victoria Cross for ordering the magazine to be flooded . However , the fire destroyed Harvey 's turret which had to be removed and rebuilt while the ship underwent repairs for several months . 
 Princess Royal participated in the Battle of Heligoland Bight a month after the war began and then was sent south to the Caribbean to prevent the German East Asia Squadron from using the Panama Canal . After the East Asia Squadron was sunk at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914 by the Invincible and Inflexible , Princess Royal rejoined the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron ( BCS ) . During the Battle of Dogger Bank she scored only a few hits , although one crippled the German armoured cruiser Blücher which allowed the enemy vessel to be caught and sunk by the concentrated fire of the British battlecruisers . Shortly afterwards , Princess Royal became the flagship of the 1st BCS , under the command of Rear Admiral Osmond Brock . She was then moderately damaged during the Battle of Jutland and required a month and a half of repairs afterwards . 
 Both ships spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea , although they did provide distant cover during Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917 . In 1920 they were both put into reserve and sold for scrap a few years later in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The acceleration of the German naval building programme in 1907 – 08 forced the Government to yield to public pressure and authorize more ships for the 1909 – 10 Construction Programme . Only a single battleship and a battlecruiser had been authorized in the 1908 – 09 Construction Programme , but three battleships and a battlecruiser were authorized in the 1909 – 10 Programme with another three battleships and a battlecruiser planned as " contingency " ships to placate the public and the Admiralty . Continuing pressure forced the Government to announce in July 1909 that the " contingency " ships would also be built . This pressure also allowed the Admiralty to gain approval to improve the size and power of its new ships so as to maintain qualitative superiority over the new German dreadnoughts then under construction . 
 The Lion @-@ class battlecruisers were designed to be as superior to the new German battlecruisers of the Moltke class as the German ships were to the Invincible class . The increase in speed , armour and gun size forced a 70 % increase in size over the Indefatigable class and made them the largest warships in the world . Their layout was adapted from the design of the first " super @-@ dreadnought " ( or 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch gunned ) class , the Orion @-@ class battleships of 1910 . The ships were the first battlecruisers to be armed with the new model 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch gun ( 343 mm ) by Vickers . The design of the Lions remedied some of the shortcomings of the preceding battlecruisers , which suffered from an inability for the en echelon amidships turrets to safely fire across deck , which limited them to a three turret broadside . This was done , however , because the greater size and weight of the new guns rendered beam turrets impracticable . As such , all four turrets in the Lions were arranged on the centreline , although ' Q ' turret was located amidships and was unable to fire directly aft . The Director of Naval Construction , Sir Philip Watts suggested that a fifth turret , superfiring over the rear turret , could be added if the ship was lengthened by three frames , 12 feet ( 4 m ) in total , and that this would add very little cost other than the £ 175 @,@ 000 for the additional turret , but add 25 % more firepower to the ship . This was not approved , however , possibly because of doubts about its feasibility .

 The Lions were significantly larger than their predecessors of the Indefatigable class . They had an overall length of 700 feet ( 213 @.@ 4 m ) , a beam of 88 feet 6 @.@ 75 inches ( 27 @.@ 0 m ) , and a draught of 32 feet 5 inches ( 9 @.@ 9 m ) at deep load . They displaced 26 @,@ 270 long tons ( 26 @,@ 690 t ) at load and 30 @,@ 820 long tons ( 31 @,@ 310 t ) at deep load , over 8 @,@ 000 long tons ( 8 @,@ 100 t ) more than the earlier ships . They had a metacentric height of 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) at deep load . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Lion @-@ class ships had two paired sets of Parsons direct @-@ drive steam turbines , each of which was housed in a separate engine @-@ room . The wing shafts were coupled to high @-@ pressure turbines and these exhausted into low @-@ pressure turbines which drove the inner shafts . A cruising stage was built into the casing of each high @-@ pressure ahead turbine . Their three @-@ bladed propellers were 12 feet 3 inches ( 3 @.@ 73 m ) in diameter on the inner shafts while the outer propellers were 11 feet 8 inches ( 3 @.@ 56 m ) in diameter . The turbines were powered by forty @-@ two Yarrow water @-@ tube boilers in seven boiler rooms . They were designed to produce a total of 70 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 52 @,@ 199 kW ) , but achieved more than 76 @,@ 000 shp ( 56 @,@ 673 kW ) during trials , although Lion did not exceed her designed speed of 28 knots ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) and Princess Royal only reached 28 @.@ 5 knots . 
 They carried 3 @,@ 500 long tons ( 3 @,@ 556 t ) of coal , and an additional 1 @,@ 135 long tons ( 1 @,@ 153 t ) of fuel oil that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate . At full capacity , they could steam for 5 @,@ 610 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 390 km ; 6 @,@ 460 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The Lion @-@ class ships mounted eight BL 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Mark V guns in four twin hydraulically powered turrets , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' Q ' and ' Y ' . Unlike the two previous classes of battlecruiser in the Royal Navy , which had turrets fore , aft and on each wing of the ship , the Lion class ships had their main armament mounted in a single line from front to rear , with ' B ' turret superimposed over ' A ' turret , ' Q ' turret mounted amidships , and ' Y ' turret aft . The guns could be depressed to − 3 ° and elevated to + 20 ° , although the rangefinders controlling the turrets were limited to + 15 ° 21 ' until superelevating prisms were installed before the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 to allow full elevation . They fired 1 @,@ 250 @-@ pound ( 567 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 582 ft / s ( 787 m / s ) ; at 14 @.@ 75 ° , this provided a maximum range of 20 @,@ 000 yd ( 18 @,@ 288 m ) with armour @-@ piercing ( AP ) shells . At 20 ° elevation , the range was extended to 23 @,@ 820 yd ( 21 @,@ 781 m ) . The rate of fire of these guns was 1 @.@ 5 – 2 rounds per minute . The ships carried a total of 880 rounds during wartime for 110 shells per gun . 
 Their secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL 4 @-@ inch Mark VII guns , most of which were mounted in casemates . The guns on their PII * or <unk> * mounts had a maximum elevation of 15 ° . They fired 31 @-@ pound ( 14 @.@ 1 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 864 ft / s ( 873 m / s ) ; this gave a maximum range of 11 @,@ 600 yd ( 10 @,@ 607 m ) . Their rate of fire was 6 – 8 rounds per minute . They were provided with 150 rounds per gun . 
 The Lion @-@ class ships were built without anti @-@ aircraft guns , but a variety of guns were fitted over the course of the war . These included the QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss gun on HA MkIc mounting . This had a maximum depression of 8 ° and a maximum elevation of 60 ° . It fired a 6 @-@ pound ( 2 @.@ 7 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 765 ft / s ( 538 m / s ) at a rate of fire of 20 rounds per minute . It had a maximum ceiling of 10 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) , but an effective range of only 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) . QF 3 inch 20 cwt AA guns on high @-@ angle MkII mounts were also used . They had a maximum depression of 10 ° and a maximum elevation of 90 ° . They fired a 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 500 ft / s ( 760 m / s ) at a rate of 12 – 14 rounds per minute . It had a maximum effective ceiling of 23 @,@ 500 ft ( 7 @,@ 200 m ) . 
 Princess Royal received two 4 @-@ inch Mark VII guns on HA MkII mounts capable of 60 ° of elevation in April 1917 and a pair of single 2 @-@ pdr MK II " pom @-@ poms " were added in April 1919 . They fired 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) shells weighing 2 pounds ( 0 @.@ 9 kg ) at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 920 ft / s ( 590 m / s ) to a maximum effective range of 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 1 @,@ 097 m ) . Their practical rate of fire was between 50 and 75 rounds per minute . 
 Two 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) submerged torpedo tubes were fitted on the beam . Fourteen Mark II * * * torpedoes were carried which had a warhead of 515 pounds ( 234 kg ) of TNT . They had two speed settings which governed their range ; at 45 knots ( 83 @.@ 3 km / h ; 51 @.@ 8 mph ) they could reach 4 @,@ 500 yards ( 4 @,@ 115 m ) or 10 @,@ 750 yards ( 9 @,@ 830 m ) at 31 knots ( 57 @.@ 4 km / h ; 35 @.@ 7 mph ) . 
 = = = Fire @-@ control = = = 
 The main guns of the Lion @-@ class ships were controlled from the conning tower . Data from a 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) Argo rangefinder located on top of the conning tower was input into a Mk I Dreyer Fire Control Table located in the transmitting station ( TS ) below the conning tower where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns . The target 's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target . ' B ' and ' X ' turrets were provided with nine @-@ foot rangefinders and were fitted as secondary control positions . 
 Fire @-@ control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding World War I and the development of the director firing system was a major advance . This consisted of a fire @-@ control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided gun data to the turrets via pointers , which the turret crewmen only had to follow . The director officer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimized the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells . Lion received her system in early 1915 while undergoing repairs after the Battle of Dogger Bank and Princess Royal got hers in early 1916 . A second director was added to each ship in 1918 . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The armour protection given to the Lions was heavier than that of the Indefatigables ; their waterline belt of Krupp Cemented Armour measured 9 inches ( 229 mm ) thick amidships in contrast to the 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) belt of their predecessors . It thinned to four inches towards the ships ' ends , but did not reach either the bow or the stern . In addition they were given an upper armour belt with a maximum thickness of six inches over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to 5 inches ( 127 mm ) abreast the end turrets . Four @-@ inch transverse bulkheads closed off the ends of the armoured citadel . Nickel @-@ steel plating was used for the protective decks . The lower armoured deck was generally only 1 inch ( 25 @.@ 4 mm ) thick except outside the citadel where it was 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) . The upper armoured deck was situated at the top of the upper armour belt and was also only one inch thick . The forecastle deck ranged from 1 @.@ 25 to 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 32 to 38 mm ) . 
 The gun turrets had 9 @-@ inch front and sides while their roofs were 2 @.@ 5 to 3 @.@ 25 inches ( 64 to 83 mm ) thick . The barbettes were protected by 9 inches of armour above the deck , but it thinned to 8 inches ( 203 mm ) above the upper armour deck and 3 inches ( 76 mm ) below it . The conning tower sides were 10 inches ( 254 mm ) thick and it had a three @-@ inch roof and communication tube . Nickel @-@ steel torpedo bulkheads 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) thick were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms . Her funnel uptakes were protected by nickel @-@ steel splinter armour 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) thick on the sides and one inch on the ends between the upper and forecastle decks . After the Battle of Jutland revealed her vulnerability to plunging shellfire , one inch of additional armour , weighing approximately 130 long tons ( 132 t ) , was added to the magazine crowns and turret roofs . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Only Lion was completed to the original design , which had the foremost funnel placed between the forward superstructure and the tripod foremast . This meant that hot clinker and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely unworkable when the ships were steaming at high speed , that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable , depending on the wind , and that the signal flags and halyards were at risk of burning . Both ships were altered to correct this problem , Lion before she commissioned , and Princess Royal as she was fitting out , at a total cost of £ 68 @,@ 170 . The fore funnel was replaced and moved aft , the original fore and mainmasts exchanged position , although the foremast was now just a pole mast , not a tripod , the spotting tower at the rear of the conning tower was removed , the conning tower enlarged , the 9 @-@ foot Argo rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower , and all the funnels were raised to the same height . The two four @-@ inch guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action as part of these modifications . 
 Although the standard British practice was to quote the cost without armament , the data available for the Lions includes guns .

 The pole foremast was modified to a tripod after 1916 . This was due to the increased weight of masthead fire @-@ control equipment associated with director firing . In 1917 Lion and Princess Royal received searchlight towers on the after funnel and mainmast while losing 1 × 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) gun each from the after battery . In early 1918 , both ships received flying @-@ off platforms on ' Q ' and ' X ' turrets , for Sopwith Pup and Sopwith 1 ½ Strutter aircraft . Lion was fitted with a torpedo control station at the aft end of her aft superstructure .

 Upon commissioning , both Lion and Princess Royal were assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron , which in January 1913 was renamed the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron ( BCS ) , although Lion became the flagship . Rear Admiral Beatty assumed command of the 1st BCS on 1 March 1913 . Lion and Princess Royal , along with the rest of the 1st BCS , made a port visit to Brest in February 1914 and the squadron visited Russia in June , where Lion entertained the Russian Royal Family aboard while in Kronstadt .

 = = = = Battle of Heligoland Bight = = = = 
 Lion 's first action was as flagship of the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral Beatty during the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914 . Beatty 's ships had originally been intended as distant support of the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast in case the large ships of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks . They turned south at full speed at 11 : 35 am when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule and the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the bar at the mouth of the Jade Estuary . The brand @-@ new light cruiser Arethusa had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers Strassburg and Cöln when Beatty 's battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12 : 37 pm . Strassburg was able to duck into the mists and evade fire , but Cöln remained visible and was quickly crippled by fire from the squadron . Beatty , however , was distracted from the task of finishing her off by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser Ariadne directly to his front . He turned in pursuit and reduced her to a flaming hulk in only three salvos at close range ( under 6 @,@ 000 yards ( 5 @.@ 5 km ) ) . At 1 : 10 pm Beatty turned north and made a general signal to retire . Beatty 's main body encountered the crippled Cöln shortly after turning north and she was sunk by two salvos from Lion . 
 Princess Royal was detached from the 1st BCS and sailed from Cromarty on 28 September to rendezvous with a Canadian troop convoy and escort it to the United Kingdom . She rejoined the 1st BCS on 26 October . Shortly afterward she was detached again to reinforce the North Atlantic and Caribbean Squadrons in the search for Admiral Graf Spee 's German East Asia Squadron after it destroyed the West Indies Squadron of Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock during the Battle of Coronel on 1 November 1914 . She arrived at Halifax on 21 November before cruising off New York City for a period and then down to the Caribbean to guard against the possibility of Graf Spee using the Panama Canal . She departed Kingston , Jamaica for the U.K. on 19 December , after the East Asia Squadron had been sunk at the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 7 December . 
 = = = = Raid on Scarborough = = = = 
 The German Navy had decided on a strategy of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast in an attempt to draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail . An earlier Raid on Yarmouth on 3 November had been partially successful , but a larger @-@ scale operation was devised by Admiral Franz von Hipper afterwards . The fast battlecruisers would actually conduct the bombardment while the entire High Seas Fleet was to station itself east of Dogger Bank to provide cover for their return and to destroy any elements of the Royal Navy that responded to the raid . But what the Germans did not know was that the British were reading the German naval codes and were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey , although they were not aware that the High Seas Fleet would be at sea as well . Admiral Beatty 's 1st BCS , now reduced to four ships , including Lion , as well as the 2nd Battle Squadron with six dreadnoughts , was detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank . 
 Admiral Hipper set sail on 15 December 1914 for another such raid and successfully bombarded several English towns , but British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet at 5 : 15 am and fought an inconclusive action with them . Vice Admiral Sir George Warrender , commanding the 2nd Battle Squadron , had received a signal at 5 : 40 that the destroyer Lynx was engaging enemy destroyers although Beatty had not . The destroyer Shark spotted the German armoured cruiser Roon and her escorts at about 7 : 00 , but could not transmit the message until 7 : 25 . Admiral Warrender received the signal , as did the battlecruiser New Zealand , but Beatty did not , despite the fact that New Zealand had been specifically tasked to relay messages between the destroyers and Beatty . Warrender attempted to pass on Shark 's message to Beatty at 7 : 36 , but did not manage to make contact until 7 : 55 . Beatty reversed course when he got the message and dispatched New Zealand to search for Roon . She was being overhauled by New Zealand when Beatty received messages that Scarborough was being shelled at 9 : 00 . Beatty ordered New Zealand to rejoin the squadron and turned west for Scarborough . 
 The British forces split going around the shallow Southwest Patch of the Dogger Bank ; Beatty 's ships passed to the north while Warrender passed to the south as they headed west to block the main route through the minefields defending the English coast . This left a 15 nautical miles ( 28 km ) gap between them through which the German light forces began to move . At 12 : 25 , the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper . HMS Southampton spotted the light cruiser Stralsund and signalled a report to Beatty . At 12 : 30 Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships . Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper 's ships , however , those were some 50 km ( 31 mi ) behind . The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron , which had been screening for Beatty 's ships , detached to pursue the German cruisers , but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions . This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape , and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers . The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape . 
 = = = = Battle of Dogger Bank = = = = 
 On 23 January 1915 , a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Franz von Hipper sortied to clear the Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements . However , the British were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of British battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Beatty . Contact was initiated at 7 : 20 am on the 24th when the British light cruiser Arethusa spotted the German light cruiser SMS Kolberg . By 7 : 35 the Germans had spotted Beatty 's force and Hipper ordered a turn to the south at 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) , believing that this would suffice if the ships that he saw to his northwest were British battleships and that he could always increase speed to Blücher 's maximum speed of 23 knots ( 26 mph ; 43 km / h ) if they were British battlecruisers . 
 Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch the Germans before they could escape . The leading ships , Lion , Princess Royal and Tiger , were doing 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) in pursuit and Lion opened fire at 8 : 52 at a range of 20 @,@ 000 yards ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) . The other ships followed a few minutes later but , hampered by the extreme range and decreasing visibility , they did not score their first hit on Blücher until 9 : 09 . The German battlecruisers opened fire themselves a few minutes later at 9 : 11 , at a range of 18 @,@ 000 yards ( 16 @,@ 000 m ) , and concentrated their fire on Lion . They first hit her at 9 : 28 on the waterline with a shell that flooded a coal bunker . Shortly afterwards a 21 @-@ centimetre ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) shell from Blücher hit the roof of ' A ' turret , denting it and knocking out the left gun for two hours . At 9 : 35 Beatty signalled ' Engage the corresponding ships in the enemy 's line ' , but Tiger 's captain , believing that Indomitable was already engaging Blücher , fired at Seydlitz , as did Lion , which left Moltke unengaged and able to continue to engage Lion without risk . Moltke and Derfflinger combined their fire to cripple Lion over the next hour even though Princess Royal engaged Derfflinger during this period . 
 In the meantime Blücher had been heavily damaged by fire from all the other battlecruisers ; her speed had dropped to 17 knots ( 20 mph ; 31 km / h ) and her steering gear had been jammed . Beatty ordered Indomitable to attack her at 10 : 48 am . Six minutes later Beatty spotted what he thought was a submarine periscope on the starboard bow and ordered an immediate 90 ° turn to port to avoid the submarine , although he failed to hoist the ' Submarine Warning ' flag because most of Lion 's signal halyards had been shot away . Almost immediately afterward Lion lost her remaining dynamo to the rising water which knocked out all remaining light and power . He ordered ' Course Northeast ' at 11 : 02 to bring his ships back to their pursuit of Hipper . He also hoisted ' Attack the rear of the enemy ' on the other halyard although there was no connection between the two signals . This caused Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Gordon Moore , temporarily commanding in New Zealand , to think that the signals meant to attack Blücher , which was about 8 @,@ 000 yards ( 7 @,@ 300 m ) to the northeast . So they turned away from the pursuit of Hipper 's main body and engaged Blücher . Beatty tried to correct the mistake , but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read amidst the smoke and haze . 
 He transferred his flag to the destroyer Attack at 11 : 50 and set off in pursuit of his battlecruisers . He caught up to them shortly before Blücher sank and boarded Princess Royal at 12 : 20 . He ordered the pursuit resumed of the German battlecruisers , but rescinded the order when it became clear that too much time had been wasted sinking Blücher and Hipper 's ships would be able to reach German waters before the British could catch them . Lion was headed home at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) when the rest of the battlecruisers caught up with her around 12 : 45 . 
 Lion 's starboard engine was temporarily shut down due to contaminated feed water , but it was restarted and Lion headed home at 10 knots ( 12 mph ; 19 km / h ) when the rest of the battlecruisers caught up with her around 12 : 45 . At 2 : 30 the starboard engine began to fail and her speed was reduced to 8 knots ( 9 @.@ 2 mph ; 15 km / h ) . Indomitable was ordered to tow Lion back to port at 3 : 00 , but it took two hours and two tries before she could start to tow Lion , and a further day @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half to reach port at speeds of 7 – 10 knots ( 8 @.@ 1 – 11 @.@ 5 mph ; 13 – 19 km / h ) , even after Lion 's starboard engine was temporarily repaired . 
 Lion was temporarily repaired at Rosyth with timber and concrete before sailing to Newcastle upon Tyne to be repaired by Palmers as the Admiralty did not wish it known that she was damaged badly enough to require repair at either Portsmouth or Devonport Dockyards lest that be seen as a sign of defeat . She was heeled 8 ° to starboard with four cofferdams in place between 9 February and 28 March to repair about 1 @,@ 500 square feet ( 140 m2 ) of bottom plating and replace five armour plates and their supporting structure . She rejoined the Battlecruiser Fleet , again as Beatty 's flagship , on 7 April . She had fired 243 rounds from her main guns , but had only made four hits : one each on Blücher and Derfflinger , and two on Seydlitz . In return she had been hit by the Germans sixteen times , but only one man was killed and twenty wounded . 
 Princess Royal hit Derfflinger once , but only forced in a pair of armour plates that flooded a coal bunker . She also hit Blücher at least twice , including the hit that crippled her , but having fired a total of 271 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch shells during the battle this gave the Princess Royal a hit rate of only 0 @.@ 7 % . She also fired two 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch shrapnel shells at the German airship L5 as it attempted to bomb the sinking Blücher , thinking that it was a British ship , despite the fact that the maximum elevation of those guns was only 20 ° . Princess Royal was not damaged during the battle . 
 = = = = Battle of Jutland = = = = 
 On 31 May 1916 Princess Royal was the flagship of the 1st BCS , under command of Rear Admiral Osmond Brock , which had put to sea with the rest of the Battlecruiser Fleet , led by Vice @-@ Admiral Beatty in Lion , to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea . The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea . Hipper 's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 3 : 20 pm , but Beatty 's ships did not spot the Germans to their east until 3 : 30 . Almost immediately afterward , at 3 : 32 , he ordered a course change to east south @-@ east to position himself astride the German 's line of retreat and called his ships ' crews to action stations . Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard , away from the British , to assume a south @-@ easterly course , and reduced speed to 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up . With this turn Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet , then about 60 miles ( 97 km ) behind him . Around this time Beatty altered course to the east as it was quickly apparent that he was still too far north to cut off Hipper . 
 This began what was to be called the ' Run to the South ' as Beatty changed course to steer east south @-@ east at 3 : 45 , paralleling Hipper 's course , now that the range closed to under 18 @,@ 000 yards ( 16 @,@ 000 m ) . The Germans opened fire first at 3 : 48 , followed almost immediately afterward by the British . The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships , Lion and Princess Royal had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire . The German fire was accurate from the beginning , but the British overestimated the range as the German ships blended into the haze . Lion and Princess Royal , as the leading British ships , engaged Lützow , the leading ship in the German formation . Lutzow targeted Lion while Derfflinger , the second ship in the German formation engaged Princess Royal , her opposite number . Fire from both German ships was very accurate , and both Lion and Princess Royal had been hit twice within three minutes of the Germans ' opening fire . By 3 : 54 the range was down to 12 @,@ 900 yards ( 11 @,@ 800 m ) , and Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 3 : 57 . Lion scored her first hit on Lützow two minutes later , but Lützow returned the favour at 4 : 00 when one of her 305 mm shells hit ' Q ' turret at a range of 16 @,@ 500 yards ( 15 @,@ 100 m ) . The shell penetrated the joint between the nine @-@ inch turret face plate and the 3 @.@ 5 @-@ inch roof and detonated over the center of the left @-@ hand gun . It blew the front roof plate and the center face plate off the turret , killed or wounded everyone in the turret , and started a fire that smouldered , despite efforts to put it out that had been thought to have been successful . Accounts of subsequent events differ , but the magazine doors had been closed and the magazine flooded when the smouldering fire ignited the eight full propellant charges in the turret working room at 4 : 28 . They burnt violently , with the flames reaching as high as the masthead , and killed most of the magazine and shell room crews still in the lower part of the mounting . The gas pressure severely buckled the magazine doors , and it is probable that the magazine would have exploded if it had not already been flooded . Royal Marine Major Francis Harvey , the mortally wounded turret commander , was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for having ordered the magazine flooded . 
 At 4 : 11 pm Princess Royal observed the track of a torpedo fired by Moltke , pass underneath her , but it was thought that the torpedo was fired by a U @-@ boat on the disengaged side . This was confirmed when the destroyer Landrail reported having spotted a periscope before the torpedo tracks were seen . The range had grown too far for accurate shooting so Beatty altered course four points to port to close the range again between 4 : 12 and 4 : 15 . This maneuver exposed Lion to the fire of the German battlecruisers and she was hit several times . The smoke and fumes from these hits caused Derfflinger to lose sight of Princess Royal , and she switched her fire to Queen Mary at 4 : 16 . By 4 : 25 the range was down to 14 @,@ 400 yards ( 13 @,@ 200 m ) and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again . However , it was too late for Queen Mary , which was hit multiple times in quick succession about that time , and her forward magazines exploded . At 4 : 30 the light cruiser Southampton , scouting in front of Beatty 's ships , spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed . Three minutes later she sighted the topmasts of Vice @-@ Admiral Reinhard Scheer 's battleships , but did not transmit a message to Beatty for another five minutes . Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting himself before ordering a sixteen @-@ point turn to starboard in succession . During the ' Run to the South ' Princess Royal was hit a total of six times by Derfflinger , but none of these were serious . 
 Lion was hit twice more , during what came to be called the ' Run to the North ' , after the German battlecruisers made their own turn north . Beatty 's ships maintained full speed to try and put some separation between them and the High Seas Fleet and gradually moved out of range . They turned north and then northeast to try to rendezvous with the main body of the Grand Fleet . At 5 : 40 pm they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers . The setting sun blinded the German gunners and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the northeast at 5 : 47 . Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it , but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east , further away from the Germans . By 6 : 35 Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were steering east @-@ southeast , leading the Grand Fleet , and continuing to engage Hipper 's battlecruisers to their southwest . A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180 ° starboard turn and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze . At 6 : 44 Beatty turned his ships southeast and to the south @-@ southeast four minutes later searching for Hipper 's ships . Beatty took this opportunity to recall the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of New Zealand and then slowed down to eighteen knots and altered course to the south to prevent himself from getting separated from the Grand Fleet . At this moment Lion 's gyrocompass failed and she made a complete circle before her steering was brought under control again . At 6 : 55 Scheer ordered another 180 ° turn which put them on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet , which had altered course itself to the south . This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer 's T and they badly damaged his leading ships . Scheer ordered yet another 180 ° turn at 7 : 13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap into which he had sent them . 
 This manoeuvre was successful and the British lost sight of the Germans until 8 : 05 pm when Castor spotted smoke bearing west @-@ northwest . Ten minutes later she 'd closed the range enough to identify German torpedo boats and engaged them . Beatty turned west upon hearing the sounds of gunfire and spotted the German battlecruisers only 8 @,@ 500 yards ( 7 @,@ 800 m ) away . Inflexible opened fire at 8 : 20 , followed almost immediately by the rest of Beatty 's battlecruisers . Shortly after 8 : 30 the pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Mauve 's II Battle Squadron were spotted and fire switched to them . The Germans were able to fire only a few rounds at them because of the poor visibility and turned away to the west . The British battlecruisers hit the German ships several times before they blended into the haze around 8 : 40 . After this Beatty changed course to south @-@ southeast and maintained that course , ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet , until 2 : 55 the next morning when the order was given to reverse course . 
 Lion , Princess Royal and the rest of the battlecruisers reached Rosyth on the morning of 2 June 1916 where Lion began repairs that lasted until 19 July . The remains of ' Q ' turret were removed during this period and not replaced until later . She had been hit a total of fourteen times and suffered 99 dead and 51 wounded during the battle . She fired 326 rounds from her main guns , but can only be credited with four hits on Lützow and one on Derfflinger . She also fired seven torpedoes , four at the German battleships , two at Derfflinger and one at the light cruiser Wiesbaden without success . 
 Upon her arrival at Rosyth , Princess Royal began repairs that lasted until 10 June . She sailed later that day for Plymouth where more permanent repairs were made until 15 July and was back at Rosyth by 21 July . She was hit nine times during the battle , six time by Derfflinger , twice by Markgraf and once by Posen , with 22 of her crew killed and 81 injured . She fired only 230 rounds from her main guns , as her visibility was often impaired by the funnel smoke and fires aboard Lion and can be credited with three hits on Lützow and two on Seydlitz . She also fired one torpedo at the German pre @-@ dreadnoughts without success . 
 = = = Post @-@ Jutland career = = = 
 Lion rejoined the Battlecruiser Fleet , again as Beatty 's flagship , on 19 July 1916 without ' Q ' turret , but then had the turret replaced during a visit to Armstrong Whitworth at Elswick that lasted from 6 to 23 September . In the meantime , on the evening of 18 August the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by Room 40 which indicated that the High Seas Fleet , less the II Squadron , would be leaving harbour that night . The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on the 19th , with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines . The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and six battlecruisers . Throughout the 19th , Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence , with the result that having reached its rendezvous in the North Sea , the Grand Fleet steered north in the erroneous belief that it had entered a minefield before turning south again . Scheer steered south @-@ eastward pursuing a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship , which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt . Having realised their mistake the Germans then shaped course for home . The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark , and broke off contact . Both the British and the German fleets returned home , the British having lost two cruisers to submarine attacks and the Germans having a dreadnought battleship damaged by torpedo . 
 Lion became the flagship of Vice @-@ Admiral W. C. Pakenham in December 1916 when he assumed command of the Battlecruiser Fleet upon Beatty 's promotion to command of the Grand Fleet . Lion had an uneventful time for the rest of the war conducting patrols of the North Sea as the High Seas Fleet was forbidden to risk any more losses . She provided support for British light forces involved in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917 , but never came within range of any German forces . Lion and Princess Royal , along with the rest of the Grand Fleet , sortied on the afternoon of 23 March 1918 after radio transmissions had revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway . However , the Germans were too far ahead of the British and escaped without firing a shot . When the High Seas Fleet sailed for Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918 to be interned , Lion was among the escorting ships . Along with the rest of the 1st BCS , Lion and Princess Royal guarded the interned ships until both ships were assigned to the Atlantic Fleet in April 1919 . 
 Lion was placed in reserve in March 1920 , paid off on 30 March 1922 , and sold for scrap on 31 January 1924 for £ 77 @,@ 000 . Princess Royal was placed in reserve in 1920 and an attempt to sell her to Chile in mid @-@ 1920 was unsuccessful . She became the flagship of the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief Scottish Coast on 22 February 1922 , but was sold for scrap in December 1922 . Both ships were scrapped to meet the tonnage limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty . 
 = Mahamuni Buddha Temple = 
 The Mahamuni Buddha Temple ( Burmese : <unk> , Burmese pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; also called the Mahamuni Pagoda ) is a Buddhist temple and major pilgrimage site , located southwest of Mandalay , Myanmar ( Burma ) ( Myanmar ) . The Mahamuni Buddha image ( literal meaning : The Great Sage ) is deified in this temple , and originally came from Arakan . It is highly venerated in Burma and central to many people 's lives , as it is seen as an expression of representing the Buddha 's life . 
 Ancient tradition refers to only five likenesses of the Buddha , made during his lifetime ; two were in India , two in paradise , and the fifth is the Mahamuni Buddha image in Myanmar . According to the legend , the Buddha visited the <unk> city of Arakan in 554 BC . King Sanda <unk> requested that an image was cast of him . After casting the Great Image , the Buddha breathed upon it , and thereafter the image became the exact likeness of the Mahamuni . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 According to legend , the Gautama Buddha visited <unk> , the capital city of Arakan during his travels on a <unk> mission to spread Buddhism . During the 26th anniversary of the King at the time , a devout Buddhist , the Buddha accompanied by Shin Ananda and 500 disciples landed at <unk> mountain peak near <unk> town . The King of Arakan , along with his Chief Queen Sandra Mala ( with her retinue of 1 @,@ 600 ladies in waiting ) , and an entourage of ministers , generals and officials , paid homage to the Buddha . They were deeply moved by his teachings and upon his departure to <unk> ( <unk> ) , the King insisted that he leave his image for people to worship . For this purpose , the Buddha then sat under a Bodhi tree for a week of meditation . During this time <unk> ( in Pāli , the ruler of the <unk> Heaven in Buddhist cosmology , supported by his assistant <unk> , moulded a lifelike image of the Buddha using ornaments donated by the king and his people . It is also said that <unk> and <unk> ( or <unk> ) created a separate pavilion for the Buddha to live and enjoy during these seven days . After looking at his own lifelike image , believed at the time to have been his only true @-@ likeness , Buddha was pleased and " imbued the image with his spiritual essence " , or " enlivened and consecrated " the image , naming it " <unk> " . He also stated that the image would last for five thousand years as his representative . 
 Historian Juliane <unk> has very succinctly explained this legend and the cult worship that has evolved around the " living " double image of Mahamuni Buddha : 
 The rich and complex mythology associated with this image includes episodes that parallel other stories about the Buddha ... The rituals and myths of Mahamuni thus accomplish two aims simultaneously : they place local contexts and actors within a universal Buddhist cosmology , and they locate a continuing biography of the Buddha in the Buddhist politics of Arakan and Upper Burma . Theravada politics characteristically extended the biographical mode of recreating the Buddha 's presence and associated with it the power of kings and other patrons of this image . The veneration of this Buddha image is thus informed by local conceptions of religious patronage in sociopolitical domains . 
 Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle relates to the nine phenomena that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed . These nine phenomena were : holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels ; the water from the tank that was used for washing the Buddha 's head would retain its quality throughout the year ; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings ; the rays faded in the presence of non @-@ believers ; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate any number of devotees ; the leaves of trees would tilt in the direction of the Buddha image ; birds would not fly over the temple ; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple . 
 Another legend narrated is linked to the six Khmer bronze statues ( three lions – with heads substituted later in Burmese style , a three @-@ headed elephant known as Airavata , and two warriors in the form of Shiva ) , which are installed in the temple in the northern end of the courtyard . These statues were originally at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia . Devotees believe that the statues have healing qualities to rub a particular part of the body against the statues to cure themselves of various ailments and diseases . 
 = = = Image history = = = 
 In the ancient history of Arakan , King <unk> of Pagan ( r . 1044 – 1077 ) attempted to move the image to Pagan , without success . In 1784 , the Burmese under the military leadership of Crown Prince <unk> <unk> of Konbaung dynasty conquered the Kingdom of Mrauk U. The religious relics of the kingdom , including the Mahamuni Buddha image , were confiscated and installed in the Mahamuni temple or Pagoda at <unk> , on the outskirts of the old capital of Mandalay . As the Mahamuni image was too large to transport as a whole , it was cut into sections and later reassembled and housed in the new temple . Mandalay became the capital under King <unk> ( r . 1853 – 1878 ) . It was also the capital under his son Thibaw ( r . 1878 – 1885 ) of the Konbaung Dynasty ( 1752 – 1885 ) . When the British annexed Upper Burma in 1885 to prevent the French from dominating it , monarchic rule ended . However , veneration of the Mahamuni image has continued , and is visited and idolised by many pilgrims , mainly Rakhine , Mon and <unk> peoples . 
 Several old bronze statues that line the courtyard of the temple have a long history as war loot . They were originally Khmer statues , found at Angkor Wat in Cambodia , and were taken to Ayutthaya in 1431 by the Siamese . In 1564 , the Burmese king <unk> conquered Ayutthaya and took thirty such statues to Bago ( Pegu ) . In 1599 , King <unk> of Mrauk U invaded Bago and brought the statues to Mrauk U. Finally , <unk> <unk> took them to <unk> in 1785 . According to local belief , many more of these statues were brought from Arakan . However , King Thibaw melted many of them to cast cannons for fortification of his palace . Of the thirty statues <unk> brought from Siam , only six remain today , and are displayed in the temple complex . They are a major attraction because of their purported healing qualities . 
 = = = Damage = = = 
 The <unk> image and its precincts suffered damage from fires in 1879 and 1884 . In the fire that broke out during the reign of King Thibaw , the seven @-@ tiered spire on the brick temple , devotional halls , causeways and others were burnt down , although the Great Image itself was saved . Gold recovered after the fire was made into a robe that currently adorns the image . In 1887 , Minister <unk> <unk> U <unk> took charge of the site and <unk> constructed the present temple around the original shrine built by King Bodawpaya . 
 In 1996 , the military rulers in Burma undertook renovation work on the Mahamuni Pagoda . During this period , the Mahamuni Buddha image was damaged in 1997 when a hole appeared in the belly of the Great Image . It was believed that thieves had drilled the hole in an attempt to steal jewels believed to be secreted within the image . It was reported that a military officer had requested to open the temple in the night , resulting in a meeting of all the senior monks from major monasteries in the area to discuss the matter . Whilst the meeting was in progress , attention was diverted to a purported rape incident committed by a Muslim man on a Buddhist girl . A major riot broke out but it turned out afterward that the Buddhist girl had not been raped at all . It was a coverup to divert attention away from the Buddha so it could be repaired . However , the mystery remains as to whether any jewellery did exist and was actually removed from the Great Image at all .

 The Mahamuni Temple or Pagoda is a complex of structures located along a road from Mandalay leading to the southwest . It was originally located on A brick paved road which was constructed from the Royal Palace of King Bodawpaya to the eastern gate of the temple , although only remnants of this road can still be seen . A major teaching monastery of some 400 monks of the <unk> Nikaya ( order ) , is one among the many monasteries which are adjacent to the Pagoda . The temple has a central shrine and is framed by an extensive grass lawn . The arcades leading to the main shrine have many kiosks , selling religious paraphernalia such as incense , candles , rosaries , flowers , robes , sandals etc . , and various restaurants and tea shops . The sanctum sanctorum , where the large Mahamuni image is deified , is a small chamber and has a roof covering made up of seven <unk> meaning tiered roofs ( derivative of the Sanskrit word <unk> ) . The ceiling has an ornate mosaic covering . The arcades are supported by 252 gilded and carved columns adorned with fine frescoes .

 The Mahamuni Buddha image is housed in a small chamber , seated on a throne in a divine posture known as the <unk> Mudra . This posture or mudra symbolises Buddha 's vanquishing of Mara ) . The legs are crossed with feet turned inwards , and the right hand touches the ground ritualistically , as a witness of his past deeds . The image is cast in bronze and weighs 6 @.@ 5 tonnes and is erected on a 1 @.@ 84 metres ( 6 @.@ 0 ft ) high pedestal and reaches a height of 3 @.@ 82 metres ( 12 @.@ 5 ft ) . Its shoulders measure 1 @.@ 84 metres ( 6 @.@ 0 ft ) and its waist measures 2 @.@ 9 metres ( 9 @.@ 5 ft ) . It is draped in royal costumes with " Brahmanic cords ( <unk> ) and regalia crossing his chest " . The image is crowned , bejewelled with diamonds , rubies and sapphires . The left hand appears imprecise , unusually large , and is seen resting in the lap with an upturned palm . 
 Gold leaves are regularly applied to the face of the Mahamuni Buddha by male devotees . Consequent to the frequent application of gold leaves , the coating of gold ( thickness 15 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) ) has given a shapeless contour to the Mahamuni image . However , it is also noted that the right hand , crown and other iconographic characteristics of royalty are free of gold leaf covering , which gives an impression that these were later additions to the original image of the Mahamuni . In 1884 , when the pagoda was burnt down , 91 kilograms ( 201 lb ) of gold was recovered from the site , which represents the continued historical veneration and perpetuation of the cult of Mahamuni . 
 = = = Other features = = = 
 A large number of ' inscription stones ' collected by King Bodawpaya are seen in a long gallery in the southeastern corner of the temple courtyard . These inscriptions , some of which are made from gilded marble and sandstone , have been collected from many regions of the country . There is also a large water tank in the southeast direction of the temple where fish and turtles are fed with rice cakes by the large number of pilgrims who visit the temple every day . Adjacent to the Buddha temple is the Mahamuni Museum , which contains displays of Buddhism throughout Asia . 
 = = Daily rituals = = 
 On February 17 , 1988 , the present Ven <unk> <unk> Panya Vamsa of <unk> Monastery and <unk> <unk> initiated the ritual of daily face washing of the deity at dawn . This ritual commences every morning at 4 am or 4 : 30 am when monks wash the face and brush the teeth of the Buddha image . It is an elaborate ritual performed for over an hour by a senior monk dressed in monastic attire , assisted by several lay helpers , dressed in white and wearing formal headdress . As soon as the drums are struck , the senior monk residing in the adjoining monastery enters the sanctum and starts the formal face washing ritual with a succession of fresh towels , offered by devotees . He then performs the act of cleaning the Mahamuni 's teeth with a large brush followed by one more sequence of cleaning with fresh towels . After this , sandalwood paste is applied to the image and it is again cleaned with towels and finally sprinkled with scented water . After the ceremony is completed , the used towels are returned to the devotees who keep these towels with reverence in their home shrines . 
 On special occasions , such as <unk> day , an orange <unk> is placed around its shoulders by the presiding monk and is fanned . A major congregation of devotees witness the rituals ; some men sit in the front enclosure while others including women and children sit in the middle and rear end of the foyer . Devotees offer food and other items brought by them on a tray to the deity and chant prayers while the rituals are being performed . During the winter season , the image is covered by a cloak of the monastic order . 
 During the reign of Burmese monarchs , offerings were made daily to the Great Image in a formal way . Food and other offerings , sheltered by a Royal white umbrella , were taken in a procession from the palace , escorted by a Minister , as an honour due to a sovereign head of the state . 
 = = Festival = = 
 A major annual pagoda festival known as the ' Mahamuni Paya <unk> ' ( ' <unk> ' meaning " festival " ) is held in early February , at the end of the Buddhist Lent to celebrate the history of the pagoda . During this festival , aside from the daily rituals , the <unk> from a " Book of Conditional Relations " is recited . This book is a philosophical text which Buddha recounted to his mother in a sermon in <unk> heaven and is a sacred scripture in the Pali language . The Pattana recitation is a special feature , which continues for several days . Monks recite from the scriptures , in groups of two or three . The festivities also include various forms of entertainment programmes such as dance , music , theatre etc . , and there is also a social event , allowing families and friends gather to greet each other . Given that large crowds of pilgrims are attracted during the festive season , guards are posted near the Great Image and video cameras are placed in many parts of the temple precincts to protect it .

 = Norsk Forurensningskontroll = 
 Norsk Forurensningskontroll AS ( literally " Norwegian Pollution Control " ) or NFK was a specialized Norwegian aviation company and aircraft operator , with a fleet of four de Havilland Canada DHC @-@ 6 Twin Otter aircraft . The company was founded in 1983 and initially intended to operate the aircraft to apply dispersants on oil spills at sea , as a part of the national oil spill defense system . However , due to oil companies , <unk> and government politics the company failed to establish such a service and instead operated the aircraft for charter , before deciding to liquidate the company in the autumn of 1986 . The airline had its main base at Bodø Airport , and was planning to establish oil @-@ spill protection bases at Hammerfest Airport and Kristiansund Airport , Kvernberget . During its existence the company co @-@ operated closely with Widerøe , which was approved by the authorities as the operators maintenance organization . 
 = = History = = 
 The airline was established in 1983 with a share capital of NOK 50 @,@ 000 , and with Harald Olsen as managing director . In November 1983 , they announced to the authorities and the general public plans to establish a fleet of four DHC @-@ 6 / 300 Twin Otters , for the application of dispersant on oil spills at sea as part of the national oil spill protection system , as well as providing an airborne radar surveillance and positioning system . The government was initially favorable to the concept , particularly as an element in improving oil spill protection and response at sea , in conjunction with permitting the oil industry to commence exploration north of the 62nd parallel north , but unfortunately government and departmental politics and the oil companies ' unwillingness to contribute to the system , led to the company 's demise . 
 The company aimed to have two aircraft operative in June 1984 , and be fully operational with 35 to 40 employees and four aircraft by 1985 , when all @-@ year oil drilling would start in the Norwegian Sea . Use of aircraft for oil spill reduction was at the time established in the United Kingdom , and Norsk Forurensningskontroll aimed to create a similar preparedness for Norway in cooperation with the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority . The cost of the four aircraft was stipulated to approximately NOK 35 million . Operation started in May 1984 with an aircraft on dry lease from Widerøe ( LN @-@ BNS ) , which was also used as system development platform . The airline stated that they hoped to have 30 to 50 operations per year . 
 In September , one of the aircraft was displayed at Farnborough Airshow , and Norsk Forurensningskontroll stated that they hoped to sell the technology abroad . The idea of having an oil spill services of this type was eventually abandoned by the authorities and by the oil industry , and instead NFK started using their aircraft for various charter purposes , such as bird counting for universities and parachuting . In 1986 , the company gained a contract with the French government for supplying a French – Canadian semi @-@ military female expedition , aiming to traverse the polar basin from the northernmost tip of Svalbard to the North Pole on skis . The aircraft was based in Svalbard , and a number of other scientific and exploration expeditions were supported , including electronic mapping of the <unk> underneath glaciers , under a contract for the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge University , financed by British Petroleum . 
 The company filed for bankruptcy in October 1986 . At the time it had NOK 29 million in debt , while its assets were three Twin Otters with an estimated value of NOK 21 million . At the time , one plane was on lease to the national airline of Portugal ( TAP ) , flying scheduled operations on the archipelago of Madeira . The largest creditors were Sparebanken Nord , who was owed 13 million and had collateral in two aircraft , Sparebanken Nordland , who were owed NOK 11 million and had collateral in one aircraft , and <unk> / <unk> Bank , who were owed NOK 1 @.@ 9 million . The banks estimated they had lost NOK 8 million on the venture . 
 = = Organization and aircraft = = 
 The company had its head office in Bodø and main base at Bodø Airport . It cooperated with Widerøe , also based in Bodø , for crews and maintenance services . The aircraft was planned to be stationed on 24 @-@ hour watch , with a reaction time of 30 minutes during daytime and 60 minutes during night . Tests showed that aircraft could be used for spills up to 5 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 4 @,@ 900 long tons ; 5 @,@ 500 short tons ) , depending on the type of oil . The dispersant should ideally be applied two hours after discharge . The dispersant application system developed for the De Havilland of Canada DHC @-@ 6 / 300 Twin Otter aircraft consisted of two 1 @,@ 550 @-@ liter ( 340 imp gal ; 410 U.S. gal ) <unk> chamber tanks for dispersant . The uniqueness of the system on board the aircraft , as it was developed by the operator NFK and Widerøe 's engineering department , was primarily that it was self @-@ contained and propelled by bleed air tapped from one of the two Pratt & Whitney gas turbines on the aircraft , pressurizing the tanks . The arrangement of the tanks gave no change in Center of Gravity during discharge of the dispersant . 
 = Tang campaign against Kucha = 
 The Tang campaign against Kucha was a military campaign led by the Tang Dynasty general Ashina She 'er against the Tarim Basin oasis state of Kucha in Xinjiang , which was aligned with the Western Turkic Khaganate . The campaign began in 648 and ended on 19 January 649 , after the surrender of the <unk> forces following a forty @-@ day siege in Aksu . Kuchean soldiers tried to recapture the kingdom with the assistance of the Western Turkic Khaganate , but were defeated by the Tang army . 
 = = Background = = 
 Kucha , a kingdom in the Tarim Basin , was a vassal of the Western Turkic Khaganate . Under the reign of Emperor Gaozu , the king <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ) provided the Tang court with tribute in 618 . In 630 , <unk> 's successor Suvarnadeva ( Chinese : <unk> ) submitted to the Tang as a vassal . A Buddhist of the Hinayana sect , Suvarnadeva had hosted the Buddhist monk Xuanzang when he arrived in Kucha during the same year . 
 Kucha supported Karasahr when the oasis state made a marriage alliance with the Western Turks and ended its tributary relationship with the Tang court in 644 . The king of Kucha , Suvarnadeva , renounced Tang suzerainty and allied with the Western Turks . Emperor Taizong responded by dispatching a military campaign led by the general Guo Xiaoke against Karasahr . 
 Karasahr was besieged in 644 by Guo . Tang forces defeated the kingdom , captured the king , and a pro @-@ Tang member of the royal family was enthroned as ruler . The new king was deposed by the Western Turks soon afterwards , and the Western Turks regained suzerainty over Karasahr . Suvarnadeva died between 646 and 648 , and his brother Haripushpa ( Chinese : <unk> ) inherited the throne as Kucha 's king . Although Haripushpa sent two tribute embassies to the Tang court , Tang Taizong had already decided to punish Kucha 's pro @-@ Turk stance by launching an expedition against the kingdom . 
 Most of the Tang expeditionary army was made up of 100 @,@ 000 cavalry supplied by the Tang empire 's Tiele allies . The commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Tang expeditionary army , Ashina She 'er , was a member of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate ruling family . He joined the Tang forces after his surrender in 635 , and served as a general leading a campaign against Karakhoja . His familiarity with the region as a former Turkic ruler contributed to his success commanding the campaigns against Kucha and Karasahr . Prior to his recruitment as a Tang general , he reigned for five years between 630 and 635 , governing the city of <unk> in the Dzungarian Basin . Ashina She 'er 's deputy commanders were <unk> Heli ( a Tiele chieftain who had also become a Tang general ) and Guo Xiaoke . 
 = = Campaign = = 
 Ashina She 'er 's soldiers were organized in five columns . The Tang army bypassed Karasahr and struck at Kucha from the north by moving through the Dzungarian Basin , which was the territory of the Chuyue ( possibly <unk> ) and <unk> , two Turkic tribes allied with the oasis state . The Tang army defeated the Chuyue and <unk> before entering the Tarim Basin , upon which the king of Karasahr fled his capital city and tried to find a defensible position in Kucha 's eastern territories . Ashina She 'er 's forces pursued the Karasahr king , took him captive , and then executed him . 
 The forces defending Kucha , consisting of 50 @,@ 000 soldiers , were lured and ambushed by Ashina . They chased after a group of 1 @,@ 000 horsemen employed by Ashina as a decoy , but encountered additional Tang forces that mounted a surprise attack . The Kuchean forces were defeated and retreated to Aksu , a nearby kingdom in the Tarim Basin . Ashina captured the king following a forty @-@ day siege , ending with the surrender of the Kucha forces on 19 January 649 . One of Ashina 's officers , acting as a diplomat , persuaded the chieftains of the region to surrender instead of fighting back . 
 Guo Xiaoke , who had led the first Tang campaign against Karasahr in 644 , was installed in Kucha as protector @-@ general of the Anxi Protectorate , or the Protectorate of the Pacified West . The headquarters of the protector @-@ general was thus moved from its original location in Gaochang to Kucha . While Ashina was in pursuit of the Kuchean king , <unk> , a Kuchean lord , traveled to request the help of the Western Turks . Guo was assassinated after the Kuchean soldiers retook the kingdom with the military assistance of the Western Turks . Ashina returned to Kucha , captured five of the kingdom 's cities , and forced the remaining cities to surrender . Tang control was re @-@ established in the oasis state . The brother of the former king , a yabgu or viceroy , was enthroned by the Chinese as a subject of the Tang empire . 
 The king of Kucha , Haripushpa , was taken to the Tang capital as a prisoner . Execution was the punishment of rebellion in accordance with Tang law . The king was pardoned by Taizong and released after a ritual venerating the emperor 's ancestors . He was also named Great Army Commander for the Militant Guards of the Left , a title he received from the emperor .

 In retribution for the death of Guo Xiaoke , Ashina She 'er ordered the execution of eleven thousand Kuchean inhabitants by decapitation . It was recorded that " he destroyed five great towns and with them many myriads of men and women ... the lands of the west were seized with terror . " After Kucha 's defeat , Ashina dispatched a small force of light cavalry led by the lieutenant Xue <unk> to Khotan , ruled by the king <unk> <unk> . The threat of an invasion persuaded the king to visit the Tang court in person . 
 The Tang expeditionary army replaced Haripushpa with his younger brother ( the " yabgu " ) , erected an inscribed stele to commemorate its victory , and returned to Chang ’ an with Haripushpa , <unk> , and Kucha 's top general as captives . All three men were given sinecures and kept at the imperial court until 650 , when they were sent back to Kucha after it became clear that the vacuum of power created by their absence had reduced the kingdom to a state of civil war and anarchy . The Kucha expedition also killed the pro @-@ Turk king of Karasahr and replaced him with a cousin , but there is no evidence that a Tang military garrison was stationed in Karasahr between 648 and 658 . Likewise , the Khotan king 's coerced trip to Chang 'an does not seem to have resulted in a Tang garrison being sent to Khotan . 
 It has long been claimed that the conquest of Kucha established Tang rule over the entire Tarim <unk> is in part due to a number of inaccurate Chinese sources linking the expedition to the establishment of the Four Garrisons of Anxi , which comprised Kucha , Karasahr , Khotan , and Kashgar . However , Zhang <unk> has used excavated texts from Gaochang ( Karakhoja or Turfan ) to show that the Tang abandoned the attempt to move the headquarters of the Protectorate of the Pacified West to Kucha after Guo Xiaoke 's assassination . Instead the headquarters returned to Gaochang until 658 , when it was moved back to Kucha following a Tang army 's suppression of a local pro @-@ Turk revolt against Haripushpa ( who died from an illness during the revolt ) . The Tang only gained a loose suzerainty over the Tarim Basin states in 649 , and did not establish military garrisons in the Tarim Basin . Most of the Tarim Basin states transferred their vassalage to the new Western Turk qaghan , Ashina Helu , in 651 , reflecting the fact that they regarded the Western Turks as their traditional overlords . The establishment of the Four Garrisons , and with them a formal Tang military protectorate over the Tarim Basin , should be dated to 658 ( after Ashina Helu 's defeat ) or even to 660 , since Kashgar remained allied with the Western Turk leader <unk> until <unk> 's defeat in later 659 . 
 It has also been claimed that the fall of Kucha led to the decline of Indo @-@ European culture in the Tarim Basin and its replacement by first Chinese and then Turkic culture . In fact , the opposite is true . Kuchean culture flourished during the seventh and eighth centuries and Kuchean music was popular in the Tang capital , in part due to the movement of Kuchean musicians to the Tang court . The <unk> of the Tarim Basin is a later development that came after the end of the Tang dynasty and had no relation to the earlier Tang protectorate in the Tarim Basin . 
 After 649 , the Tang Dynasty continued their war against the Western Turks under the reign of Emperor Gaozong , Taizong 's successor . Gaozong conducted a campaign led by general Su Dingfang against the Western Turk qaghan , Ashina Helu in 657 . The qaghan surrendered , the Western Turks were defeated , and the khaganate 's former territories were annexed by the Tang . The Tang retreated from beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern Tajikistan and Afghanistan after a Turkic revolt in 662 , and lost the Tarim Basin to local revolts and Tibetan incursions in 665 @-@ 670 . The Tang regained the Tarim Basin in 692 and again lost it to the Tibetans in the 790s , the Four Garrisons having already been cut off from the rest of the Tang empire by a Tibetan conquest of the Gansu Corridor . Although the Tibetan empire collapsed in the middle of the ninth century , the Tang Dynasty lacked the means to regain dominance in the Tarim Basin and itself ended in 907 with the abdication of Emperor Ai .

 " Dirrty " is a song recorded by American recording artists Christina Aguilera and Redman for the former 's fourth studio album Stripped ( 2002 ) . Despite Aguilera 's first three years of commercial success , she was displeased with the lack of control over her image . In response , she desired to create a song that would represent her authentic persona . She approached hip hop producer Rockwilder and suggested using Redman 's 2001 song " Let 's Get Dirty ( I Can 't Get in da Club ) " as a guide . The final result , " Dirrty " , is an R & B and hip hop song that also features rapping verses from Redman . The song is about sexual activities . 
 RCA Records sent " Dirrty " to American radio stations in September 2002 as the lead single from Stripped . RCA and Sony Music Entertainment later released the song as a CD single . The single was Aguilera 's first to fail to enter the top twenty of the US Billboard Hot 100 , where it peaked at number 48 . In Europe and Oceania , it reached the top five of charts in countries including Australia , Denmark , Ireland , Netherlands , Switzerland , and the United Kingdom . 
 The music video for " Dirrty " , directed by David LaChapelle , was intended to publicize Aguilera 's new image . It depicts sexual fetishes such as mud wrestling and muscle worshipping . The controversial video eliminated her image as a bubblegum pop singer . It received criticism from various news publications and other recording artists , and it was banned on Thai television due to its sexual content . Aguilera defended the video , calling it inspirational as it put her to the forefront . " Dirrty " was included on the setlists of Aguilera 's three major concert tours : the Justified and Stripped Tour ( 2003 ) , the Stripped Tour ( 2003 ) , and the Back to Basics Tour ( 2006 – 08 ) .

 American singer Christina Aguilera rose to prominence with the success of her 1999 self @-@ titled debut album . It topped the US Billboard 200 and was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America . It produced three Billboard Hot 100 number @-@ one singles : " Genie in a Bottle " , " What a Girl Wants " , and " Come On Over Baby ( All I Want Is You ) " . Despite the success , Aguilera was displeased with being marketed as her then @-@ manager Steve Kurtz desired , and felt unable to control her image . She told The Sydney Morning Herald her dissatisfaction with being a part of the late 1990s teen pop trend , " The label [ RCA Records ] wanted to push the cookie @-@ cutter , [ ... ] almost virginal kind of imagery that wasn 't me , " Aguilera said . " I really wanted to squirm away from that , because I really thought it was really fake and superficial and untrue of what I was about . " 
 " Dirrty " was among the last tracks to be recorded for Aguilera 's 2002 album Stripped . It was recorded at the Enterprise Studios in Burbank and Conway Studios in Hollywood , Los Angeles by Oscar Ramirez , <unk> <unk> , and Dylan " 3 @-@ D " Dresdow . Aguilera desired to create a " down and dirty " song that would announce her new image . She approached hip hop producer Rockwilder , who had worked with her on " Lady Marmalade " , and suggested recording a song in the vein of Redman 's 2001 hip hop song " Let 's Get Dirty ( I Can 't Get in da Club ) " . " Dirrty " ultimately became a " near @-@ remake " of its predecessor , as Entertainment Weekly said . Rapper Redman , who previously appeared on Eminem 's 2001 song " Off the Wall " , in which Eminem disses Aguilera , is featured on the song . Aguilera intended to use a misspelled title to personalize the song , also considering " <unk> " or " <unk> " . The title reflects the music video , which Aguilera describes as " gritty , [ with ] underground , illegal stuff going on . "

 " Dirrty " is a hip hop and R & B song . Composed in the key of G minor , it has a moderately fast tempo of 100 beats per minute . The lines in the refrain and Redman 's rapping verses are emphasized by a pair of B ♭ octave dyads . Aguilera 's vocal range on the track spans F3 to D5 . Redman 's original ape @-@ like sounds from " Let 's Get Dirty " are also featured on " Dirrty " . According to Stylus Magazine 's Todd Burns , the song features a bassline which " doesn 't quite mesh with the song in a natural way " and an " effective " overdubbing technique . The song 's lyrics detail sexual activities such as table dancing . Jon Pareles noted that Aguilera was determined to shed her teen pop image that she achieved with her early works , and decided to show her sexuality and aggression in the " self @-@ explanatory " " Dirrty " . Writing for The Guardian , Betty Clarke described the song 's lyrics as " majestically filthy . " A sequel to the song entitled " Still Dirrty " was recorded by Aguilera for her 2006 album Back to Basics .

 Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called it " the most instantly gratifying " song from Stripped . Todd Burns from Stylus Magazine labeled it " one of the most interesting songs of the year " and compared its styles to Britney Spears ' " image transformation " on " I 'm a Slave 4 U " ( 2001 ) . In a separate review , Burns deemed it the best single of 2002 , writing , " That 's what pop music is all about , appealing to as many people as possible . " Reviewing Aguilera 's 2008 compilation album Keeps Gettin ' Better : A Decade of Hits , Nick Levine from Digital Spy called " Dirrty " the " sluttiest , <unk> club banger in recent memory . " 
 Jancee Dunn called the release of " Dirrty " as the lead single " a shame " and opined that it misrepresented the rest of the album . Likewise , Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic was disappointed towards the track 's being released as the lead single and found Aguilera 's vocal range in the song too narrow . He added that the song 's R & B styles " fit [ Aguilera ] poorly " and negatively compared it to the " slinky sexiness " of " I 'm a Slave 4 U " . Michael Paoletta from Billboard called the song " horribly derivative " , while NME 's Jim Wirth said that " Dirrty " was " probably the pick of an inconsistent crop . " Entertainment Weekly critic Seymour Craig gave it a D- , calling Aguilera 's voice " desperate and shrill , " and found it to be an unsuccessful attempt to gain street cred . " Dirrty " won the Best Single award at the 2003 Q Awards . The song also earned a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 45th Grammy Awards , but lost to Santana 's " The Game of Love " featuring Michelle Branch .

 The music video for " Dirrty " was directed by David LaChapelle . It was filmed on September 8 and 9 , 2002 , in Los Angeles , at an abandoned newspaper print building . Aguilera took boxing lessons to prepare for the video , and more than 100 dancers auditioned . Aguilera wanted to make sure that she and LaChapelle had the same vision for the video , not wanting it to be " glossy or pretty . " A scene where Aguilera is lowered into a boxing ring in a cage and a dance segment in the ring were filmed on the first day . The following day , a foxy boxing scene , a table dancing segment , a party scene with Redman 's rapping his part , and a shower scene were filmed . The video premiered on September 30 , 2002 , on Making the Video , and was described as " a post @-@ apocalyptic orgy . " 
 The video opens with Aguilera gearing up and riding a motorcycle into a nightclub . Wearing a bikini and buttocks @-@ bearing chaps , she is lowered from a cage into a boxing ring and dances , accompanied by several back @-@ up dancers . A masked woman is lowered into the ring , and the two engage in foxy boxing .

Redman then proceeds down a hallway , passing people such as mud wrestlers , a contortionist , and furries . The video proceeds to a scene of Aguilera and back @-@ up dancers splashing and dancing while being sprayed with water in a room containing several urinals , as a possible reference to urolagnia . It features several sexual fetishes , from mud wrestling to muscle worshipping .

 The video generated controversy and presented Aguilera 's new public image , eliminating her previous bubblegum pop singer and " girl next door " image . When Aguilera 's collaborator Linda Perry first saw the video , she asked Aguilera : " Are you high ? This is annoying . Why are you doing this ? " Protests also occurred in Thailand over Thai @-@ language posters in the video that translate to " Thailand 's Sex Tourism " and " Young Underage Girls " . LaChapelle stated that he had not known what the posters stated , and Aguilera 's recording company in the country disallowed Thai television stations from playing the video . 
 Aguilera 's new image was so widely rejected by the public that it began to overshadow her music . Tim Walker from The Independent wrote : " [ Aguilera ] simulated masturbation while wearing little more than a pair of leather chaps . " Entertainment Weekly described Aguilera 's image in the video as " the world 's <unk> reptile woman , " and The Village Voice captioned her as a xenomorph from the Alien series . Several of Aguilera 's contemporaries , such as Shakira and Jessica Simpson , expressed disapproval of her image and the sexuality of the video . Time magazine commented that " she appeared to have arrived on the set ... direct from an intergalactic hooker convention . " Writer Emma Forrest remarked : " What she 's depicting is subcultures within sexuality , and to say that this is normal young woman 's sexuality is just not fair . ... Even Madonna never did that to girls . " Aguilera told Blender in response to the criticism : 
 I like to shock — I think it 's inspiring . I love to play and experiment , to be as tame or as outlandish as I happen to heel on any given day . When you are bold and open , artistically speaking , in music and in video , a whole bunch of people automatically feel threatened by you , especially in Middle America ... OK , I may have been the naked @-@ ass girl in the video , but if you look at it carefully , I 'm also at the forefront . I 'm not just some lame chick in a rap video ; I 'm in the power position , in complete command of everything and everybody around me . To be totally balls @-@ out like that is , for me , the measure of a true artist . 
 Despite the criticism , the video was a number @-@ one video on MTV 's series Total Request Live ( TRL ) in October 2002 . " Dirrty " was picked as the fifth greatest music video throughout TRL history in the final countdown on November 16 , 2008 . LA Weekly selected it as the fourth greatest music video on TRL , writing : " Ass @-@ less chaps : An underutilized pop star accessory . " The video was nominated for Best Female Video , Best Dance Video , Best Pop Video , and Best Choreography at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards . It also earned six nominations at the 2003 Music Video Production Association Awards , and won two : Best Styling and Best Make @-@ Up . The video ranked at number 100 on Slant Magazine 's list of " The 100 Greatest Music Videos of All Time " in 2003 . In late 2008 , the video was voted the ninth " Sexiest Music Video of All Time " by over a quarter of a million FHM readers in a poll the magazine ran worldwide . It also appeared at number two on VH1 list of " <unk> Sexy Music Videos " in 2013 . The music video is credited as the origin of the <unk> dance move , which would later become popular among contemporary female artists , such as the Pussycat Dolls and Beyoncé .

 Aguilera first performed " Dirrty " at the 2002 MTV Europe Music Awards in Barcelona , recreating the music video 's scenes and wearing the same chaps in the video for the performance . She later performed the song on UK television shows CD : UK and Top of the Pops in 2002 , and then as part of a medley with " Fighter " at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in August 2003 , which was backed by guitarist Dave Navarro . 
 " Dirrty " was included on the setlists of Aguilera 's three major concert shows . For the 2003 Justified & Stripped Tour and Stripped Tour , it was the opening song on the setlists . For the performance , Aguilera appeared in torso @-@ baring black outfit and black hair , which , according to San Francisco Chronicle 's Neva <unk> and MTV 's Christina <unk> , resembled Cher 's styles . The performance at the Wembley Arena in London was recorded for the 2004 video release Stripped Live in the U.K .. " Dirrty " was also included on the setlist of Aguilera 's 2006 @-@ 08 Back to Basics Tour , as part of the circus segment . The performance incorporated elements of " Cell Block Tango " from the Broadway musical Chicago , and " Entrance of the Gladiators " by Julius <unk> , and featured a carousel <unk> . Ben Walsh from The Independent highlighted " Dirrty " as the best song of the concert . However , The Observer 's Kitty Empire called it " <unk> . " The performance at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre in Adelaide was recorded for the 2008 video release Back to Basics : Live and Down Under . 
 Two weeks after its premiere , the video was parodied by actress Sarah Michelle Gellar on Saturday Night Live , who said ( playing Aguilera ) : " When people see this video , they gonna stop thinking of me as some blonde @-@ haired , bubblegum , music @-@ industry ho – and start thinking of me as an actual ho . " Aguilera later commented that she found the parody disappointing and that she " could have made a funnier script out of it . " The song was covered by British Ed Sheeran for a Live Lounge session of BBC Radio 1 in February 2015 . Sheeran 's performance was instrumented by guitar and incorporated soul elements . " Dirrty " was also parodied by Stephen Merchant on the show Lip Sync Battle in May 2015 .

 The Western Wall , Wailing Wall or Kotel ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> , translit . : HaKotel <unk> <unk> ; Ashkenazic pronunciation : <unk> ; Arabic : <unk> <unk> , translit . : <unk> <unk> al @-@ <unk> , <unk> . : the Buraq Wall , or al @-@ <unk> : the Place of Weeping ) is an ancient limestone wall in the Old City of Jerusalem . It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall , known also in its entirety as the " Western Wall " . The wall was originally erected as part of the expansion of the Second Jewish Temple by Herod the Great , which resulted in the encasement of the natural , steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the Temple Mount , in a large rectangular structure topped by a huge flat platform , thus creating more space for the Temple itself and its auxiliary buildings . 
 The Western Wall is considered holy due to its connection to the Temple Mount . Because of the status quo policy , the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray , though it is not the holiest site in the Jewish faith , which lies behind it . The original , natural and irregular @-@ shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever larger Temple compound to be built at its top . This process was finalised by Herod the Great , who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls , built to support extensive substructures and earth fills needed to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape . On top of this box @-@ like structure Herod built a vast paved esplanade which surrounded the Temple . Of the four retaining walls , the western one is considered to be closest to the former Temple , which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount esplanade . Just over half the wall 's total height , including its 17 courses located below street level , dates from the end of the Second Temple period , and is commonly believed to have been built around 19 BCE by Herod the Great , although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE . The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian , the courses of medium @-@ sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad era , while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date , especially from the Ottoman period . 
 The term Western Wall and its variations is mostly used in a narrow sense for the section traditionally used by Jews for prayer , and it has also been called the " Wailing Wall " , referring to the practice of Jews weeping at the site over the destruction of the Temples . During the period of Christian Roman rule over Jerusalem ( ca . 324 – 638 ) , Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except to attend Tisha be @-@ Av , the day of national mourning for the Temples , and on this day the Jews would weep at their holy places . The term " Wailing Wall " was thus almost exclusively used by Christians , and was revived in the period of non @-@ Jewish control between the establishment of British Rule in 1920 and the Six @-@ Day War in 1967 . The term " Wailing Wall " is not used by Jews and increasingly many others who consider it derogatory . 
 In a broader sense , the Western Wall can refer to the entire 488 meter @-@ long retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount . The classic portion now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter , near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount , while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the Muslim Quarter , with the small exception of a 25 ft ( 8 m ) section , the so @-@ called Little Western Wall . The segment of the Western retaining wall traditionally used for Jewish liturgy known as the " Western Wall " derives its particular importance to it having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings , and displaying much more of the original Herodian stonework than the " Little Western Wall " . In religious terms , the " Little Western Wall " is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the " presence of God " ( <unk> ) , and the underground Warren 's Gate , which has been out of reach since the 12th century , even more so . 
 The wall has been a site for Jewish prayer and pilgrimage for centuries ; the earliest source mentioning this specific site as a place of worship is from the 16th century . The previous sites used by Jews for mourning the destruction of the Temple , during periods when access to the city was prohibited to them , lay to the east , on the Mount of Olives and in the Kidron Valley below it . From the mid @-@ 19th century onwards , attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews , but none was successful . With the rise of the Zionist movement in the early 20th century , the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities , the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem . During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace , with a particularly deadly riot in 1929 in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured . After the 1948 Arab @-@ Israeli War the Eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan . Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the Jewish quarter , and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years , effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall . This period ended on June 10 , 1967 , when Israel gained control of the site following the Six @-@ Day War . Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site the Moroccan Quarter was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Early Jewish texts referred to a " western wall of the Temple " , but there is doubt whether the texts were referring to the outer , retaining wall called today " the Western Wall " , or to the western wall of the actual Temple . The earliest Jewish use of the Hebrew term " ha @-@ kotel ha @-@ ma <unk> " , " the Western Wall " , as referring to the wall visible today , was by the 11th @-@ century poet Ahimaaz ben <unk> . The name " Wailing Wall " , and descriptions such as " wailing place " , appeared regularly in English literature during the 19th century . The name Mur des Lamentations was used in French and <unk> in German . This term itself was a translation of the Arabic el @-@ <unk> , or " Place of Weeping " , the traditional Arabic term for the wall . This description stemmed from the Jewish practice of coming to the site to mourn and bemoan the destruction of the Temple . 
 At some time in the 19th century , the Arabs began referring to the wall as the al @-@ Buraq Wall . This was based on the tradition that inside the wall was the place where Muhammad tethered his miraculous winged steed , al @-@ Buraq . The tradition on which this is based only states that the Prophet , or the angel <unk> 'il ( Gabriel ) , tethered the steed at the gate of the mosque , meaning : at the gate of the Temple Mount . The location of the entry gate identified as the one used by Muhammad varied throughout the centuries , from the eastern and southern walls , to the southwest corner , and finally at the western wall , and specifically at Barclay 's Gate immediately adjacent to the " Wailing Place " of the Jews . Israeli archaeologist Meir Ben @-@ Dov concluded that the Muslim association with Western Wall began in the late nineteenth century in response to renewed Jewish identification with the site .

 The Western Wall commonly refers to a 187 @-@ foot ( 57 m ) exposed section of ancient wall situated on the western flank of the Temple Mount . This section faces a large plaza and is set aside for prayer . In its entirety , however , the above @-@ ground portion of the Western Wall stretches for 1 @,@ 600 feet ( 488 m ) , most of which is hidden behind residential structures built along its length . Other revealed sections include the southern part of the Wall which measures approximately 80 metres ( 262 ft ) and another much shorter section known as the Little Western Wall which is located close to the Iron Gate . The wall functions as a retaining wall , supporting and enclosing the ample substructures built by Herod the Great around 19 BCE . Herod 's project was to create an artificial extension to the small quasi @-@ natural plateau on which the First and Second Temples stood , transforming it into the almost rectangular , wide expanse of the Temple Mount visible today . 
 At the Western Wall Plaza , the total height of the Wall from its foundation is estimated at 105 feet ( 32 m ) , with the exposed section standing approximately 62 feet ( 19 m ) high . The Wall consists of 45 stone courses , 28 of them above ground and 17 underground . The first seven visible layers are from the Herodian period . This section of wall is built from enormous <unk> limestone blocks , possibly quarried at either <unk> 's Cave situated under the Muslim Quarter of the Old City or at Ramat Shlomo 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) northwest of the Old City . Most of them weigh between 2 and 8 short tons ( 1 @.@ 8 and 7 @.@ 3 t ) each , but others weigh even more , with one extraordinary stone located slightly north of Wilson 's Arch measuring 13 metres ( 43 ft ) and weighing approximately 517 tonnes ( 570 short tons ) . Each of these <unk> is framed by fine @-@ chiseled borders . The margins themselves measure between 5 and 20 centimetres ( 2 and 8 in ) wide , with their depth measuring 1 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) . In the Herodian period , the upper 10 metres ( 33 ft ) of wall were 1 metre ( 39 in ) thick and served as the outer wall of the double colonnade of the Temple platform . This upper section was decorated with pilasters , the remainder of which were destroyed when the Byzantines reconquered Jerusalem from the Persians in 628 . 
 The next four courses , consisting of smaller plainly dressed stones , date from the Umayyad period ( Muslim , 8th century ) . Above that are 16 – 17 courses of small stones from the Mamluk period ( Muslim , 13 – 16th century ) and later . The well known story that the top layers of the Wall were added by Sir Moses Montefiore is unsubstantiated .

 In January 2015 a transgender Jewish woman , Kay Long , was denied access to the Wall , first by the women 's section and then by the men 's section . Long 's presence was prevented by " modesty police " at women ’ s section who are not associated with the rabbi of the Western Wall or the site administration . They are a group of female volunteers who guard the entrance to the women ’ s section preventing entry to visitors who are not dressed to their idea of Orthodox modesty standards for women . The director of Jerusalem ’ s Open House , a community center for the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community , noted that Long ’ s experience was not unique . " Gender separation at the Western Wall is harmful for transgender people . This is not the first story that we know of with transgender religious people that wanted to go to the Western Wall and pray and couldn ’ t , " said Elinor Sidi , who expects that the battle for access to the Western Wall for the <unk> community will be a long and difficult one .

 = = = Construction 19 BCE = = = 
 According to the Hebrew Bible , Solomon 's Temple was built atop what is known as the Temple Mount in the 10th century BCE and destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE , and the Second Temple completed and dedicated in 516 BCE . Around 19 BCE Herod the Great began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount . In addition to fully rebuilding and enlarging the Temple , he artificially expanded the platform on which it stood , doubling it in size . Today 's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform . In 2011 , Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod 's death , found under the foundation stones of the wall . The excavators came upon the coins inside a ritual bath that predates Herod 's building project , which was filled in to create an even base for the wall and was located under its southern section . This seems to indicate that Herod did not finish building the entire wall by the time of his death in 4 BCE . The find confirms the description by historian Josephus Flavius , which states that construction was finished only during the reign of King Agrippa II , Herod ’ s great @-@ grandson . Given Josephus ' information , the surprise mainly regarded the fact that an unfinished retaining wall in this area could also mean that at least parts of the splendid Royal Stoa and the monumental staircase leading up to it could not have been completed during Herod 's lifetime . Also surprising was the fact that the usually very thorough Herodian builders had cut corners by filling in the ritual bath , rather than placing the foundation course directly onto the much firmer bedrock . Some scholars are doubtful of the interpretation and have offered alternative explanations , such as , for example , later repair work . 
 Herod 's Temple was destroyed by the Romans , along with the rest of Jerusalem , in 70 CE , during the First Jewish @-@ Roman War .

 In the early centuries of the Common Era , after the Roman defeat of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE , Jews were banned from Jerusalem . There is some evidence that Roman emperors in the 2nd and 3rd centuries did permit them to visit the city to worship on the Mount of Olives and sometimes on the Temple Mount itself . When the empire became Christian under Constantine I , they were given permission to enter the city once a year , on the ninth day of the month of Av , to lament the loss of the Temple at the wall . The Bordeaux Pilgrim , written in 333 CE , suggests that it was probably to the perforated stone or the Rock of Moriah , " to which the Jews come every year and anoint it , bewail themselves with groans , rend their garments , and so depart " . This was because an Imperial decree from Rome barred Jews from living in Jerusalem . Just once per year they were permitted to return and bitterly grieve about the fate of their people . Comparable accounts survive , including those by the Church Father , Gregory of Nazianzus and by Jerome in his commentary to Zephaniah written in 392 CE . In the 4th century , Christian sources reveal that the Jews encountered great difficulty in buying the right to pray near the Western Wall , at least on the 9th of Av . In 425 CE , the Jews of the Galilee wrote to Byzantine empress Aelia Eudocia seeking permission to pray by the ruins of the Temple . Permission was granted and they were officially permitted to resettle in Jerusalem .

 Several Jewish authors of the 10th and 11th centuries write about the Jews resorting to the Western Wall for devotional purposes . Ahimaaz relates that Rabbi Samuel ben <unk> ( 980 @-@ 1010 ) gave money for oil at " the sanctuary at the Western Wall . " Benjamin of Tudela ( 1170 ) wrote " In front of this place is the Western Wall , which is one of the walls of the Holy of Holies . This is called the Gate of Mercy , and hither come all the Jews to pray before the Wall in the open court . " The account gave rise to confusion about the actual location of Jewish worship and some suggest that Benjamin in fact referred to the Eastern Wall along with its Gate of Mercy . While Nahmanides ( d . 1270 ) did not mention a synagogue near the Western Wall in his detailed account of the temple site , shortly before the Crusader period a synagogue existed at the site . Obadiah of <unk> ( 1488 ) states " the Westen Wall , part of which is still standing , is made of great , thick stones , larger than any I have seen in buildings of antiquity in Rome or in other lands . " 
 Shortly after the Siege of Jerusalem , in 1193 , Saladin ’ s son and successor al @-@ Afdal established the land adjacent to the wall as a charitable trust . It was named after an important mystic Abu <unk> Shu 'aib and dedicated to Moroccan settlers who had taken up residence there . Houses were built only 4 metres ( 13 ft ) away from the wall . The first mention of the Islamic tradition that Buraq was tethered at the site is from the 14th century . A manuscript by Ibn <unk> , ( d . 1328 ) , refers to Bab al @-@ <unk> , an old name for a gate along the southwestern wall of the Haram al @-@ Sharif .

 In 1517 , the Turkish Ottomans conquered Jerusalem from the Mamluks who had held it since 1250 and various folktales relate Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent 's quest to locate the Temple site and his order to have the area " swept and sprinkled , and the Western Wall washed with rosewater " upon its discovery . In the late 16th century , Suleiman ordered the construction of an imposing fortress @-@ wall to be built around the entire city , which still stands today . At the time , Jews received official permission to worship at the site and Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan built an oratory for them there . In 1625 arranged prayers at the Wall are mentioned for the first time . 
 Over the centuries , land close to the Wall became built up . Public access to the Wall was through the Moroccan Quarter , a labyrinth of narrow alleyways . In May 1840 a firman issued by Ibrahim Pasha forbade the Jews to pave the passageway in front of the Wall . It also cautioned them against “ raising their voices and displaying their books there . ” They were , however , allowed “ to pay visits to it as of old . ” 
 Rabbi Joseph Schwarz writing in the mid @-@ 19th @-@ century records : 
 " This wall is visited by all our brothers on every feast and festival ; and the large space at its foot is often so densely filled up , that all cannot perform their devotions here at the same time . It is also visited , though by less numbers , on every Friday afternoon , and by some nearly every day . No one is molested in these visits by the <unk> , as we have a very old firman from the Sultan of Constantinople that the approach shall not be denied to us , though the Porte obtains for this privilege a special tax , which is , however , quite insignificant . " 
 Over time the increased numbers of people gathering at the site resulted in tensions between the Jewish visitors who wanted easier access and more space , and the residents , who complained of the noise . This gave rise to Jewish attempts at gaining ownership of the land adjacent to the Wall . 
 In the late 1830s a wealthy Jew named <unk> Luria attempted to purchase houses near the Wall , but was unsuccessful , as was Jewish sage Abdullah of Bombay who tried to purchase the Western Wall in the 1850s . In 1869 Rabbi Hillel Moshe <unk> settled in Jerusalem . He arranged that benches and tables be brought to the Wall on a daily basis for the study groups he organised and the minyan which he led there for years . He also formulated a plan whereby some of the courtyards facing the Wall would be acquired , with the intention of establishing three synagogues – one each for the Sephardim , the Hasidim and the Perushim . He also endeavoured to re @-@ establish an ancient practice of " guards of honour " , which according to the <unk> in <unk> , were positioned around the Temple Mount . He rented a house near the Wall and paid men to stand guard there and at various other gateways around the mount . However this set @-@ up lasted only for a short time due to lack of funds or because of Arab resentment . In 1874 , Mordechai <unk> paid for the repaving of the alleyway adjacent to the wall . 
 In 1887 Baron Rothschild conceived a plan to purchase and demolish the Moroccan Quarter as " a merit and honor to the Jewish People . " The proposed purchase was considered and approved by the Ottoman Governor of Jerusalem , Rauf Pasha , and by the Mufti of Jerusalem , Mohammed Tahir Husseini . Even after permission was obtained from the highest secular and Muslim religious authority to proceed , the transaction was shelved after the authorities insisted that after demolishing the quarter no construction of any type could take place there , only trees could be planted to beautify the area . Additionally the Jews would not have full control over the area . This meant that they would have no power to stop people from using the plaza for various activities , including the driving of mules , which would cause a disturbance to worshippers . Other reports place the scheme 's failure on Jewish infighting as to whether the plan would foster a detrimental Arab reaction . 
 In 1895 Hebrew linguist and publisher Rabbi Chaim <unk> became entangled in a failed effort to purchase the Western Wall and lost all his assets . Even the attempts of the Palestine Land Development Company to purchase the environs of the Western Wall for the Jews just before the outbreak of World War I never came to fruition . In the first two months following the Ottoman Empire ’ s entry into the First World War , the Turkish governor of Jerusalem , <unk> Bey , offered to sell the Moroccan Quarter , which consisted of about 25 houses , to the Jews in order to enlarge the area available to them for prayer . He requested a sum of £ 20 @,@ 000 which would be used to both rehouse the Muslim families and to create a public garden in front of the Wall . However , the Jews of the city lacked the necessary funds . A few months later , under Muslim Arab pressure on the Turkish authorities in Jerusalem , Jews became forbidden by official decree to place benches and light candles at the Wall . This sour turn in relations was taken up by the <unk> Bashi who managed to get the ban overturned . In 1915 it was reported that Djemal Pasha closed off the wall to visitation as a sanitary measure .

 * These firmans were cited by the Jewish contingent at the International Commission , 1930 , as proof for rights at the Wall . Muslim authorities responded by arguing that historic sanctions of Jewish presence were acts of tolerance shown by Muslims , who , by doing so , did not concede any positive rights .

 In December 1917 , British forces under Edmund Allenby captured Jerusalem from the Turks . Allenby pledged " that every sacred building , monument , holy spot , shrine , traditional site , endowment , pious bequest , or customary place of prayer of whatsoever form of the three religions will be maintained and protected according to the existing customs and beliefs of those to whose faith they are sacred " . 
 In 1919 Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann , anxious to enable Jews to access their sacred site unmolested , approached the British Military Governor of Jerusalem , Colonel Sir Ronald Storrs , and offered between £ 75 @,@ 000 and £ 100 @,@ 000 ( approx . £ 5m in modern terms ) to purchase the area at the foot of the Wall and rehouse the occupants . Storrs was enthusiastic about the idea because he hoped some of the money would be used to improve Muslim education . Although they appeared promising at first , negotiations broke down after strong Muslim opposition . Storrs wrote two decades later : 
 " The acceptance of the proposals , had it been practicable , would have obviated years of wretched humiliations , including the <unk> of the Wall and pavement and the unmannerly braying of the tragi @-@ comic Arab band during Jewish prayer , and culminating in the horrible outrages of 1929 " 
 In early 1920 , the first Jewish @-@ Arab dispute over the Wall occurred when the Muslim authorities were carrying out minor repair works to the Wall ’ s upper courses . The Jews , while agreeing that the works were necessary , appealed to the British that they be made under supervision of the newly formed Department of Antiquities , because the Wall was an ancient relic . 
 In 1926 an effort was made to lease the Maghrebi waqf , which included the wall , with the plan of eventually buying it . Negotiations were begun in secret by the Jewish judge Gad <unk> , with financial backing from American millionaire Nathan Straus . The chairman of the Palestine Zionist Executive , Colonel F. H. Kisch , explained that the aim was " quietly to evacuate the Moroccan occupants of those houses which it would later be necessary to demolish " to create an open space with seats for aged worshippers to sit on . However , Straus withdrew when the price became excessive and the plan came to nothing . The Va 'ad Leumi , against the advice of the Palestine Zionist Executive , demanded that the British expropriate the wall and give it to the Jews , but the British refused . 
 In 1928 the Zionist Organisation reported that John Chancellor , High Commissioner of Palestine , believed that the Western Wall should come under Jewish control and wondered " why no great Jewish philanthropist had not bought it yet " .

 In 1922 , a status quo agreement issued by the mandatory authority forbade the placing of benches or chairs near the Wall . The last occurrence of such a ban was in 1915 , but the Ottoman decree was soon retracted after intervention of the <unk> Bashi . In 1928 the District Commissioner of Jerusalem , Edward Keith @-@ Roach , acceded to an Arab request to implement the ban . This led to a British officer being stationed at the Wall making sure that Jews were prevented from sitting . Nor were Jews permitted to separate the sexes with a screen . In practice , a flexible modus vivendi had emerged and such screens had been put up from time to time when large numbers of people gathered to pray . 
 On September 24 , 1928 , the Day of Atonement , British police resorted to removing by force a screen used to separate men and women at prayer . Women who tried to prevent the screen being dismantled were beaten by the police , who used pieces of the broken wooden frame as clubs . Chairs were then pulled out from under elderly worshipers . The episode made international news and Jews the world over objected to the British action . The Chief Rabbi of the <unk> Jews in Jerusalem issued a protest letter on behalf of his community , the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> Yisroel strongly condemning the desecration of the holy site . Various communal leaders called for a general strike . A large rally was held in the Etz Chaim Yeshiva , following which an angry crowd attacked the local police station in which they believed the British officer involved in the fiasco was sheltering . 
 Commissioner Edward Keith @-@ Roach described the screen as violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any construction in the Western Wall area . He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council . The Arabs were concerned that the Jews were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move , ultimately intended to take possession of the Al @-@ Aqsa Mosque . The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and blaming the Jewish beadle at the Wall . It stressed that the removal of the screen was necessary , but expressed regret over the ensuing events . 
 A widespread Arab campaign to protest against presumed Jewish intentions and designs to take possession of the Al Aqsa Mosque swept the country and a " Society for the Protection of the Muslim Holy Places " was established . The <unk> Leumi responding to these Arab fears declared in a statement that " We herewith declare emphatically and sincerely that no Jew has ever thought of encroaching upon the rights of Moslems over their own Holy places , but our Arab brethren should also recognise the rights of Jews in regard to the places in Palestine which are holy to them . " The committee also demanded that the British administration expropriate the wall for the Jews . 
 From October 1928 onward , Mufti Amin al @-@ Husayni organised a series of measures to demonstrate the Arabs ' exclusive claims to the Temple Mount and its environs . He ordered new construction next to and above the Western Wall . The British granted the Arabs permission to convert a building adjoining the Wall into a mosque and to add a minaret . A muezzin was appointed to perform the Islamic call to prayer and Sufi rites directly next to the Wall . These were seen as a provocation by the Jews who prayed at the Wall . The Jews protested and tensions increased . 
 A British inquiry into the disturbances and investigation regarding the principal issue in the Western Wall dispute , namely the rights of the Jewish worshipers to bring appurtenances to the wall , was convened . The Supreme Muslim Council provided documents dating from the Turkish regime supporting their claims . However , repeated reminders to the Chief Rabbinate to verify which apparatus had been permitted failed to elicit any response . They refused to do so , arguing that Jews had the right to pray at the Wall without restrictions . Subsequently , in November 1928 , the Government issued a White Paper entitled " The Western or Wailing Wall in Jerusalem : Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies " , which emphasised the maintenance of the status quo and instructed that Jews could only bring " those accessories which had been permitted in Turkish times . " 
 A few months later , Haj Amin complained to Chancellor that " Jews were bringing benches and tables in increased numbers to the wall and driving nails into the wall and hanging lamps on them . " 
 = = = = 1929 Palestine riots = = = = 
 In the summer of 1929 , the Mufti Haj Amin Al <unk> ordered an opening be made at the southern end of the alleyway which straddled the Wall . The former cul @-@ de @-@ sac became a thoroughfare which led from the Temple Mount into the prayer area at the Wall . Mules were herded through the narrow alley , often dropping excrement . This , together with other construction projects in the vicinity , and restricted access to the Wall , resulted in Jewish protests to the British , who remained indifferent . 
 On August 14 , 1929 , after attacks on individual Jews praying at the Wall , 6 @,@ 000 Jews demonstrated in Tel Aviv , shouting " The Wall is ours . " The next day , the Jewish fast of Tisha B 'Av , 300 youths raised the Zionist flag and sang <unk> at the Wall . The day after , on August 16 , an organized mob of 2 @,@ 000 Muslim Arabs descended on the Western Wall , injuring the beadle and burning prayer books , liturgical fixtures and notes of supplication . The rioting spread to the Jewish commercial area of town , and was followed a few days later by the Hebron massacre . 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured in the Arab riots , and in the subsequent process of quelling the riots 110 Arabs were killed by British police . This was by far the deadliest attack on Jews during the period of British Rule over Palestine .
