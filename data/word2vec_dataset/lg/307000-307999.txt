 De Benneville " Bert " Bell ( February 25 , 1895 – October 11 , 1959 ) was the National Football League ( NFL ) commissioner from 1945 until his death in 1959 . As commissioner , he introduced competitive parity into the NFL to improve the league 's commercial viability and promote its popularity , and he helped make the NFL the most financially sound sports enterprise and preeminent sports attraction in the United States ( US ) . He was posthumously inducted into the charter class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame . 
 Bell played football at the University of Pennsylvania , where as quarterback , he led his team to an appearance in the 1917 Rose Bowl . After being drafted into the US Army during World War I , he returned to complete his collegiate career at Penn and went on to become an assistant football coach with the Quakers in the 1920s . During the Great Depression , he was an assistant coach for the Temple Owls and a co @-@ founder and co @-@ owner of the Philadelphia Eagles . 
 With the Eagles , Bell led the way in cooperating with the other NFL owners to establish the National Football League Draft in order to afford the weakest teams the first opportunity to sign the best available players . He subsequently became sole proprietor of the Eagles , but the franchise suffered financially . Eventually , he sold the team and bought a share in the Pittsburgh Steelers . During World War II , Bell astutely argued against the league suspending operations until the war 's conclusion . 
 After the war , he was elected NFL commissioner and sold his ownership in the Steelers . As commissioner , he implemented a proactive anti @-@ gambling policy , negotiated a merger with the All @-@ America Football Conference ( AAFC ) , and unilaterally crafted the entire league schedule with an emphasis on enhancing the dramatic effect of late @-@ season matches . During the Golden Age of Television , he tailored the game 's rules to strengthen its appeal to mass media and enforced a policy of blacking out local broadcasts of home contests to safeguard ticket receipts . Amid criticism from franchise owners and under pressure from Congress , he unilaterally recognized the NFLPA and facilitated in the development of the first pension plan for the players . He survived to oversee the " Greatest Game Ever Played " and to envision what the league would become in the future . 
 = = Early life ( 1895 – 1932 ) = = 
 Bell was born de Benneville Bell , on February 25 , 1895 , in Philadelphia to John C. Bell and Fleurette de Benneville Myers . His father was an attorney who served a term as the Pennsylvania Attorney General . His older brother , John C. , Jr . , was born in 1892 . Bert 's parents were very wealthy , and his mother 's lineage predated the American Revolutionary War . His father , a Quaker of the University of Pennsylvania ( class of 1884 ) during the early days of American football , accompanied him to his first football game when Bell was six years old . Thereafter , Bell regularly engaged in football games with childhood friends . 
 In 1904 , Bell matriculated at the Episcopal Academy , the Delancey School from 1909 to 1911 and then the Haverford School until 1914 . About this time , his father was installed as athletics director at Penn and helped form the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) . At Haverford , Bell captained the school 's football , basketball , and baseball teams , and " was awarded The Yale Cup [ for being ] ' The pupil who has done the most to promote athletics in the school . ' " Although he excelled at baseball , his devotion was to football . His father , who was named a trustee at Penn in 1911 , said of Bell 's plans for college , " Bert will go to Penn or he will go to hell . " 
 = = = University of Pennsylvania ( 1914 – 1919 ) = = = 
 Bell entered Penn in the fall of 1914 as an English major and joined Phi Kappa Sigma . In a rare occurrence for a sophomore , he became the starting quarterback for Penn 's coach George H. Brooke . On the team , he also was as a defender , punter , and punt returner . After the team 's 3 – 0 start , Bell temporarily shared possession of his quarterbacking duties until he subsequently reclaimed them later in the season , as Penn finished with a record of 3 – 5 – 2 . 
 Prior to Penn 's 1916 season , his mother died while he was en route to her bedside . Nevertheless , he started the first game for the Quakers under new coach Bob Folwell , but mixed results left him platooned for the rest of the season . Penn finished with a record of 7 – 2 – 1 . However , the Quakers secured an invitation to the 1917 Rose Bowl against the Oregon Ducks . Although the best offensive gain for Penn during their 20 – 14 loss to Oregon was a 20 @-@ yard run by Bell , he was replaced late in the game at quarterback after throwing an interception . 
 In the 1917 season , Bell led Penn to a 9 – 2 record . Afterwards , he registered with a Mobile Hospital Unit of the US Army for World War I and was deployed to France in May 1918 . As a result of his unit participating in hazardous duty , it received a congratulatory letter for bravery from General John J. Pershing , and Bell was promoted to first sergeant . After the war , Bell returned to the United States in March 1919 . He returned to Penn as captain of the team in the fall and again performed erratically . The Quakers finished 1919 with a 6 – 2 – 1 record . Academically , his aversion to attending classes forced him to withdraw from Penn without a degree in early 1920 . His collegiate days ended with his having been a borderline All @-@ American , but this period of his life had proven that he " possessed the qualities of a leader . " 
 = = = Early career ( 1920 – 1932 ) = = = 
 Bell assembled the Stanley Professionals in Chicago in 1920 , but he disbanded it prior to playing any games because of negative publicity received by Chicago due the Black Sox Scandal . He joined John Heisman 's staff at Penn as an assistant coach in 1920 , and Bell would remain there for several years . At Penn , he was well regarded as a football coach , and after its 1924 season , he drew offers for , but declined , head @-@ coaching assignments at other universities . At least as early as 1926 , his avocation was socializing and frequenting Saratoga Race Course , where he counted as friends Tim Mara , Art Rooney , and George Preston Marshall . In 1928 , Bell tendered his resignation at Penn in protest over the emphasis of in @-@ season scrimmages during practices by Lud Wray , a fellow assistant coach . Bell 's resignation was accommodated prior to the start of the 1929 season . 
 Bell was then an employee of the Ritz @-@ Carlton in Philadelphia . At one point , he tried his hand as a stock broker and lost $ 50 @,@ 000 ( presently , $ 689 @,@ 050 ) during the Wall Street Crash of 1929 . His father bailed him out of his deprivation , and he returned to working at the Ritz . From 1930 until 1932 , he was a backfield coach for the Temple Owls football team . In 1932 , Marshall tried to coax Bell into buying the rights to a NFL franchise , but Bell disparaged the league and ridiculed the idea . When Pop Warner was hired to coach Temple for the 1933 season , Warner chose to hire his own assistants and Bell was let go .

 By early 1933 , Bell 's opinion on the NFL had changed , and he wanted to become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia . After being advised by the NFL that a prerequisite to a franchise being rendered in Philadelphia was that the Pennsylvania Blue Laws would have to be mollified , he was the force majeure in lobbying to getting the laws deprecated . He borrowed funds from Frances Upton , partnered with Wray , and he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia which he christened as the Philadelphia Eagles . 
 After the inaugural 1933 Philadelphia Eagles season , Bell married Upton at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia . Days later , his suggestion to bestow the winner of the NFL championship game with the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy was affirmed . In 1934 , the Eagles finished with a 4 – 7 record , The Eagles ' inability to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets , and his failure to sign a talented college prospect led him to adduce that the only way to bring stability to the league was to institute a draft to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent players . In 1935 , his proposal for a draft was accepted , and in February 1936 , the first draft kicked off , at which he acted as Master of Ceremonies . Later that month , his first child , Bert Jr . , was born . 
 In the Eagles ' first three years , the partners exhausted $ 85 @,@ 000 ( presently , $ 1 @,@ 449 @,@ 484 ) , and at a public auction , Bell became sole owner of the Eagles with a bid of $ 4 @,@ 500 ( presently , $ 76 @,@ 737 ) . Austerity measures forced him to supplant Wray as head coach of the Eagles , wherein Bell led the Eagles to an 1 – 11 finish , their worst record ever ( as of the 2016 season ) . In December , an application for a franchise in Los Angeles was obstructed by Bell and Pittsburgh Steelers owner Rooney as they deemed it too far of a distance to travel for games . During the Eagles ' 2 @-@ 8 @-@ 1 1937 season , his second child , John " Upton " , was born . In the Eagles ' first profitable season , 1938 , they posted a 5 – 6 record . The Eagles finished 1 – 9 – 1 in 1939 and 1 – 10 in 1940 . 
 = = = Pittsburgh Steelers ( 1940 – 1945 ) = = = 
 In December 1940 , Bell <unk> the sale of Rooney 's Steelers to Alexis Thompson , and then Rooney acquired half of Bell 's interest in the Eagles . In a series of events known as the Pennsylvania Polka , Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster and their territorial rights in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh . Ostensibly , Rooney had provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20 % commission on the sale of the Steelers . Bell became the Steelers head coach and Rooney became the general manager . 
 During the training camp of the Pittsburgh 's inaugural season with the nickname Steelers , Bell was buoyant with optimism about the team 's prospect , but he became crestfallen after Rooney denigrated the squad and flippantly remarked that they looked like the " [ s ] ame old Steelers " ( SOS ) . After losing the first two games of the 1941 season , Rooney compelled Bell into resigning as head coach . Bell 's coaching career ended with a 10 – 46 – 2 record , and for coaches with at least five years in the NFL , it is the worst record ever ( as of the 2012 season ) . His first daughter and last child , Jane Upton , was born several months after the season 's conclusion . 
 By 1943 , 40 % of the NFL rosters had been drafted into the United States Armed Forces for World War II . The resulting difficulty in fielding a full @-@ strength squad led some owners to recommend the league should shut down until the war ended . Bell auspiciously argued against this as he feared they might not be able to resume operations easily after the war , and since Major League Baseball was continuing unabated , then they should also . 
 Throughout Bell 's affiliation with the Steelers , he suffered monetarily and Rooney bought an increasing allotment of the franchise from him . Compounding Bell 's problems , Arch Ward organized the All @-@ America Football Conference ( AAFC ) in 1944 to displace the NFL 's sovereignty in professional football . Ward 's AAFC promptly began luring players to join the league , which resulted in salaries being driven up drastically . In Bill Dudley 's contract proceedings with the Steelers , he attributed Bell 's anxiety during the negotiations to the rivalry from the AAFC . Furthermore , by the end of 1945 , the Steelers were in their most economically perilous situation in its history .

 Elmer Layden was appointed the first NFL commissioner in 1941 , but Ward appeared as dictating his hiring . Layden tendered his resignation for personal reasons January 1946 . Bell , who was not well respected in Pittsburgh , was elected to replace him . He received a three @-@ year contract at $ 20 @,@ 000 ( $ 242 @,@ 696 ) per year , and transacted a sale of his stake in the Steelers to Rooney , albeit for a price Bell did not construe was full @-@ value . He was then immediately placed at the center of a controversy wherein the owners denied Dan Reeves permission to relocate the Cleveland Rams to Los Angeles . Bell moderated a settlement , and , as a result , the Los Angeles Rams were formed . As a precondition to the Rams leasing the Los Angeles Coliseum , they signed Kenny Washington , which marked the beginning of the end of racial segregation on the field , but also caused " ' all hell to break loose ' " amidst the owners . 
 The drawing up of a regular season schedule had been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the league 's inception . The crux of the problem was the scheduling of games meant weighing the interest of owners who , early in the season , wanted their franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds , versus owners who wanted to play the weaker franchises to pad their team 's win @-@ loss record . The resultant impasse coerced the owners , in 1946 , to confer upon Bell the sole discretion in developing the league 's schedule . He utilized this responsibility to , early in the season , pit the weaker teams against other weak teams , and the strong teams against other strong teams . His goal was to augment game attendances by keeping the difference in team standings to a minimum as deep into the season as possible . 
 On the eve of the 1946 championship game , Bell was notified that Merle Hapes and Frank Filchock of the New York Giants had been implicated in a bribing scandal . Filchock was sanctioned by Bell to play in the game but Hapes was suspended . At the next NFL owners ' meeting , Bell was worried the repercussions from this event would lead to his firing . However he was pleasantly surprised to learn that his contract would be elevated to five years at $ 30 @,@ 000 per year . Reinvigorated with renewed support , he persuaded the owners to allow him to put sudden @-@ death overtime into the playoffs . 
 Subsequently , he wrote an anti @-@ gambling resolution into the league constitution , which empowered him with the ability to permanently ban any NFL associated personnel for betting on a game or for withholding information on a game being possibly fixed . Furthermore , to obstruct gamblers from getting inside information , he secreted the names of officials he would assign to games , and he directed each team to promulgate a precursory injury report which listed anyone who might not participate in a game . Eventually , he lobbied to get every state in the US to criminalize the fixing of sporting events and put employees on the payroll of the NFL to investigate potential betting scams . 
 = = = = AAFC @-@ NFL merger ( 1948 – 1950 ) = = = = 
 The NFL 's struggle against the AAFC generated stress on wages , attendance , marketing , and by 1949 , it had prevented the NFL for showing a profit for three consecutive years . Bell and representatives from both leagues met to attempt a merger , but their efforts were fruitless . In an unrelated matter , he apprised the owners that attendance records had shown televising games locally had a negative impact on the sale of home tickets . Nevertheless , he actualized the NFL 's first television contract — the 1949 championship game . Simultaneously , he dealt with a lawsuit from Bill Radovich , who had been blacklisted for leaving the Lions and gaining employment with the AAFC . Bell and the owners were advised by John C. Jr. that this lawsuit was potentially not winnable , and the ramifications from the outcome of the case weighed heavily on Bell . 
 One of the primary impediments in an AAFC @-@ NFL merger was the supposed violation of " territorial rights " claimed by Marshall . Eventually , Bell gathered enough support to effectuate a compromise with the AAFC . In late 1949 , the leagues merged , and Bell would stay on as commissioner with his contract extended from five to ten years as three AAFC teams ( the Cleveland Browns , San Francisco 49ers , and Baltimore Colts ) were subsumed . Seeking to capitalize on the publicity of the residual rivalry , he utilized " exquisite dramatic " and business sense and allocated the 1950 opening game to a contest between the 1949 champion Eagles versus the perennial AAFC champion Browns . Feeling financially secure after the merger , he purchased his first home for himself and his family in <unk> , Pennsylvania . 
 = = = = Marketing of the NFL ( 1950 – 1956 ) = = = = 
 In 1950 , Bell originated a blackout rule into the NFL which forbid all teams to televise their home games within a 75 @-@ mile radius of their stadium – except for the Rams . Consequently , the United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) opened an investigation into a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act . <unk> , the Rams attendance for 1950 dropped off by 50 % , and this signaled a potential financial disaster . In 1951 , he licensed the DuMont Television Network to air the championship games for the next five years , and he stipulated that teams were free to develop their own television contracts independently . 
 However , preceding 1951 season , he reimposed the blackout rule on all teams in the league . The DOJ filed suit over this and Bell publicly retorted , " You can 't give fans a game for free on TV and also expect them to go to the ballpark " ; nevertheless , the suit was ordered to trial for January 1952 . After the 1951 season ended , he gained unilateral control over the setting of a television strategy for the NFL . He negotiated a deal with DuMont , which granted it the rights to nationally broadcast one regular season game every week , and he directed that the income from this contract was to be shared equally between all the teams . In the DOJ 's case , the judge ruled that the blackout policy was legal , but both Bell , and the franchises collectively , were enjoined from negotiating a TV contract ; Bell was ecstatic . Later that year , Bell forced one of the owners of the Cleveland Browns to sell all of his shares in the team after Bell determined the owner had bet on Browns ' football games . Although he hated to fly , at some indeterminate point , he visited the training camps of every team and lectured on the danger gamblers posed to the league . 
 Bell authorized a Pro Bowl to be held at the end of each season in order to showcase the talents of the best players . But in the early 1950s , on the field activities sometimes denigrated to borderline assault and battery with teams ' star players being viciously targeted by opposing players . He answered charges the league was too savage by saying , " ' I have never seen a maliciously dirty football player in my life and I don 't believe there are any . ' " Nevertheless , he ordered broadcasts to follow a strict rule of conduct whereby TV announcers would not be permitted to criticize the game , and neither fights , nor injuries , could be televised by virtue in his belief that announcers were " ' salesman for professional football [ and ] we do not want kids believing that engaging in fights is the way to play football . ' " 
 Bell was criticized for censoring TV broadcasts , a charge he dismissed as not pertinent because he believed he was not impeding the print media but only advertising a product . After CBS and NBC gained the rights to broadcast the games in 1956 , he advised the franchises to avoid criticizing the games or the officials , and forewarned that TV would give " ' us our greatest opportunity to sell the NFL and everyone must present to the public the greatest games ... combined with the finest sportsmanship . ' " This relationship with television was the beginning of the NFL 's rise to becoming America 's most popular sport . 
 = = = = Compromise with the NFLPA ( 1956 – 1957 ) = = = = 
 In Radovich v. National Football League , the Supreme Court ruled in Radovich 's favor and declared the NFL was subject to antitrust laws , and the implication was that the legality of the draft and reserve clause were dubious . Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business . He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court 's ruling . The House Judiciary committee , chaired by Emanuel Celler — who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished , convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision . Red Grange and Bell testified at the committee 's solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport 's success . Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti @-@ labor , and it seemed as if Congress was going to accept their position . Faced with Congressional opposition , Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives . 
 However , Bell was speaking only for himself and without the auspices of the owners . At the next owners ' meeting , Rooney admonished they either had to recognize the NFLPA or remove Bell as commissioner . In order to do this , they had to agree in a vote that required a super @-@ majority . Bell unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the owners to permit the NFLPA to act as a bargaining agent for the players . However , he did reach a compromise with the owners to get them to acquiesce to some of the NFLPA 's requests for salary standards and health benefits . 
 = = = = Final days ( 1958 – 1959 ) = = = = 
 For the 1958 season , the durations of timeouts was extended from 60 to 90 seconds and Bell mandated officials call a few TV timeouts during each game — a change which triggered criticism from sportswriters . The 1958 championship game became the first NFL championship game decided in overtime and it was considered to be the greatest football game ever played . The game further increased football 's marketability to television advertising , and the drama associated with overtime was the catalyst . Years later , after witnessing Bell openly crying after the game , Raymond Berry attributed it to Bell 's realization of the impact the game would have on the prevalence of the sport . 
 The death of Mara in February 1959 unsettled Bell and he experienced a heart attack later that month . He converted to Catholicism in the summer of 1959 because of the lifelong urging of his wife , Mara 's death , and his enduring friendship with Rooney , a practicing Catholic . Bell was advised by his doctor to avoid going to football games , to which he quipped , " I 'd rather die watching football than in my bed with my boots off . " Bell and his children attended an Eagles game at Franklin Field on October 11 , 1959 . The Eagles held complimentary box seats for him and guests to watch the game , but he preferred to buy his own tickets and sit with the other fans . Sitting behind the end zone during the fourth quarter of the game , he suffered a heart attack and died later that day . 
 Afterwards , he was remembered as " a man of buoyant joviality , with a rough and ready wit , laughter and genuine humility and honesty , clearly innocent of pretense and [ pretension ] . " His funeral was held at <unk> 's St. Margaret Roman Catholic Church and Monsignor Cornelius P. Brennan delivered the eulogy , as close friends and admirers attended the mass . Dominic <unk> and all the extant owners of the NFL franchises were pallbearers . Bell was interred at Calvary Cemetery in West Conshohocken , Pennsylvania . 
 = = Legacy and honors = = 
 Bell was inducted into the Professional Football Hall of Fame , the Penn Athletics Hall of Fame , the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame , and Haverford 's Athletic Hall of Fame . The Maxwell Football Club , which he founded in 1937 , has presented the best NFL player of the year with the Bert Bell Award since 1959 . The Bert Bell Benefit Bowl was exhibited in his honor from 1960 through 1969 . 
 Though his career spanned the desegregation and reintegration of the NFL , as an owner , he never had an African American on any of his teams , but Bert Jr. believed the mere discussion of whether his father was prejudiced was absurd . Bell 's handling of the merger with the AAFC was acclaimed as a personal triumph . Although he did not have the wherewithal to prevent the wholesale betting on games , he was proactive in ensuring games were not tampered with by gamblers , and he created the foundation of the contemporary NFL anti @-@ gambling policy . 
 Bell was criticized as being too strict with his refusal to let sold @-@ out games to be televised locally . Nevertheless , his balancing of television broadcasts against protecting game attendance made the NFL the " healthiest professional sport in America " , and he was the " leading protagonist in pro football 's evolution into America 's major sport . " He had understood that the league needed a cooperative television contract with revenue @-@ sharing , but he failed to overcome the obstacles to achieve it . He was portrayed by sportswriters as ensuring the owners treated the players fairly , and his decision to recognize the NFLPA in the face of adversity from owners was a " master stroke " in thwarting Congressional intervention . After he initiated terms for a pension plan with the players in 1959 , little progress was made with the NFLPA , however , the first players ' pension plan @-@ the Bert Bell National Football League Retirement Plan , was approved in 1962 . 
 Bell 's implementation of the draft did not show immediate results , but it was " the single greatest contributor to the [ league ] ' s prosperity " in its first eighty @-@ four years . His original version of the draft was later ruled unconstitutional , but his anchoring of the success of the league to competitive balance has been " hailed by contemporaries and sports historians " . Bell had often said , " [ o ] n any given Sunday , any team in the NFL can beat any other team . "

 = Matsalu National Park = 
 Matsalu National Park ( previously Matsalu Nature Reserve , Estonian : Matsalu <unk> , often just Matsalu ) is a nature reserve and national park situated in <unk> County , Estonia . Matsalu National Park spans an area of 486 @.@ 1 km2 ( 187 @.@ 7 sq mi ) , comprising Matsalu Bay , the Kasari River delta , the village of Matsalu and surrounding areas . 
 Matsalu Bay ( Estonian : Matsalu <unk> ) is one of the most important wetland bird areas in Europe , due to its prime position on the East Atlantic Flyway . Large numbers of migratory birds use Matsalu as a staging area . Every spring over two million waterfowl pass Matsalu , of which around 1 @.@ 6 million are long @-@ tailed ducks . 
 Matsalu National Park is a home for a number of endangered species , many of which are listed in the Estonian IUCN Red List , including the white @-@ tailed eagle of the highest conservation category , a lot of bird species of the second and third protection categories , 22 strongly protected plant species , the natterjack toad , and ten species of mammals of the second conservation category . 
 = = Description = = 
 Matsalu National Park covers a total area of 486 @.@ 1 km2 ( 187 @.@ 7 sq mi ) , encompassing Matsalu Bay along with the delta of the Kasari River and its surrounding areas — floodplains , coastal meadows , reedbeds , woodlands , wooded meadows , and the section of <unk> around the mouth of the bay , which includes more than 50 islands . 224 @.@ 3 km2 ( 86 @.@ 6 sq mi ) of the protected area is terrestrial and 261 @.@ 8 km2 ( 101 @.@ 1 sq mi ) is aquatic . Matsalu Bay is shallow , brackish and rich in nutrients . The bay is 18 km ( 11 @.@ 2 mi ) long and 6 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) wide , but has an average depth of only 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 5 ft ) and a maximum depth of 3 @.@ 5 m ( 11 ft ) . Water salinity is approximately 0 @.@ 7 per mil . Shoreline length of the bay is about 165 km ( 102 @.@ 5 mi ) . The bay 's shoreline lacks high banks and is populated mostly with shingle shores , with muddy and overgrown reed in the innermost , sheltered part of the bay . 
 Kasari River is the biggest of several rivers that run into Matsalu Bay . The delta of the Kasari River is not in its natural condition due to dredging between 1930 and 1960 ; the alluvial meadow of the delta ( 40 km2 ( 15 sq mi ) ) , most of which is actively managed , is one of the biggest open wet meadows in Europe . Reeds and rushes surrounding the main channel expand westwards up to 100 m ( 328 ft ) every year . Annual inflow into the Matsalu Bay from the Kasari River exceeds the volume of the bay itself approximately eight times ; average seasonal variation of the Kasari River exceeds 1 @.@ 7 metres ( 6 ft ) . The rivers carry large quantities of nutrient @-@ rich sediments into the bay from an over 3 @,@ 500 km2 ( 1 @,@ 350 sq mi ) drainage basin . The sediments are deposited in river estuaries , allowing reedbeds to expand . 
 A total of 282 bird species have been recorded in Matsalu , among which 175 are nesting and 33 are transmigrant waterfowl . 49 species of fish and 47 species of mammals are registered in the area of the nature reserve , along with 772 species of vascular plants . 
 Every spring over two million waterfowl pass Matsalu , including 10 @,@ 000 — 20 @,@ 000 Bewick 's swans , 10 @,@ 000 greater scaups , common goldeneyes , tufted ducks , <unk> and many others . A colony of up to 20 @,@ 000 barnacle geese , over 10 @,@ 000 greylag geese and thousands of waders stop on the coastal pastures in spring . The most numerous birds of passage ( around 1 @.@ 6 million ) are long @-@ tailed ducks . Approximately 35 @,@ 000 — 40 @,@ 000 ducks feed in the reedbeds in spring . In autumn , about 300 @,@ 000 migratory waterfowl pass Matsalu . The wetland is the biggest autumn stopping ground of common cranes in Europe . The highest recorded number of cranes at the park has been 23 @,@ 000 . 
 = = History = = 
 Scientific research in Matsalu started around 1870 , when Valerian <unk> , the curator of the Natural History Museum of the University of Tartu , gave a short overview of birds near Matsalu Bay . Between 1928 and 1936 <unk> Kumari researched birds in Matsalu and suggested a creation of the bird protection area there in 1936 . In 1939 , parts of the bay ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) were protected for mud used in mud @-@ baths . 
 Research in Matsalu became regular in 1945 , when the Institute of Botany and Zoology of the Estonian Academy of Sciences established a research base in Penijõe . Matsalu Nature Reserve was founded in 1957 , mainly to protect nesting , moulting and migratory birds . The first permanent workers ( administrators and scientists ) started in 1958 and the Penijõe research base became the administrative centre of the newly created nature reserve . The Estonian Bird Ringing Centre ( Estonian : <unk> ) , the coordinator of bird ringing in Estonia , is also located in Penijõe . 
 In 1976 , Matsalu was included in the list of wetlands of international importance under the International Convention on the Protection of Wetlands ( Ramsar Convention ) . The European Diploma of Protected Areas was awarded to Matsalu Nature Reserve in 2003 by the Council of Europe , in recognition of the park 's success in preserving the diversity of habitats and the numerous species of birds and other biota groups in the nature reserve . Matsalu is the only nature reserve in Estonia to hold the European Diploma . The diploma was extended for five years in 2008 . 
 In 2004 , Matsalu Nature Reserve , along with surrounding areas , became Matsalu National Park . Matsalu has seven bird @-@ watching towers ( Penijõe , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) and three hiking trails . 
 = = Matsalu International Nature Film Festival = = 
 Matsalu International Nature Film Festival ( Estonian : Matsalu <unk> festival ) is held every autumn in the nearby town of Lihula . The festival is organized by the non @-@ profit organization <unk> Matsalu <unk> Festival , which was set up in late 2003 . In February 2010 , <unk> Matsalu <unk> Festival partnered with the Estonian State Forest Management Centre ( <unk> ) and will jointly organize the film festivals in the future . 
 The first Matsalu Nature Film Festival was held between October 3 and October 5 , 2003 , in Lihula with a competitive program of 23 films from 7 countries . More than 2 @,@ 500 people visited the festival that year . The second festival was held between September 23 , and September 25 , 2004 , with participants from 14 countries , a competitive program of 35 films and around 5 @,@ 000 visitors . The third festival took place between September 22 and September 25 , 2005 , with a competitive program of 39 films from 16 countries and over 7 @,@ 000 visitors . The fourth festival , held between September 21 and September 24 in 2006 , had 21 participating countries and 41 competing films . The fifth Matsalu Nature Film Festival was held between September 19 and September 23 , 2007 , and had more than 7 @,@ 000 visitors . Organizers admit that as the festival is held on a nature reserve , it cannot grow much larger in a little town and therefore plan to bring mostly European nature documentaries to the festival , at the same time not forgetting the human @-@ related topics . 
 In 2007 , organizers of the Matsalu International Nature Film Festival received the Environmental Award of the Year from the Estonian Ministry of Environment . The ministry pointed out persistent and successful organization of the film festival over the years , which has popularized nature protection and contributed significantly to environmental awareness .

 = 1956 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1956 Atlantic hurricane season featured a low number of tropical cyclones , although every tropical storm and hurricane affected land . There were twelve tropical storms , a third of which became hurricanes . One of the hurricanes strengthened to the equivalent of a major hurricane , which is a Category 3 or greater on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . The strongest hurricane of the season was Betsy , which was also the most damaging storm of the season : it destroyed 15 @,@ 000 houses and left $ 40 million in damage in Puerto Rico . Betsy was also the deadliest of the season , having killed 18 people in the French West Indies , two from a shipwreck in the Caribbean Sea , and 16 in Puerto Rico . Tropical Storm Dora struck Mexico in September and killed 27 people . 
 The season officially started on June 15 , although an unnamed storm developed about a week prior over the western North Atlantic Ocean . A later storm that formed over the Gulf of Mexico on June 12 alleviated drought conditions in the south @-@ central United States . Hurricane Anna developed in late July and hit Mexico . Tropical storms Carla and Ethel both formed near the Bahamas and moved northeastward until dissipating . The lone hurricane that hit the contiguous United States was Hurricane Flossy . One of the final storms of the year , Greta , was an unusually large hurricane that produced high waves from Florida to the Lesser Antilles . It developed in the western Caribbean and moved across much of the southeastern United States , causing $ 24 @.@ 8 million in damage and 15 deaths . There were also several tropical depressions , as well as one subtropical cyclone , in the season . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 The season officially began on June 15 , the date that the Weather Bureau office in Miami , Florida , under the direction of Gordon Dunn , began daily monitoring of all tropical disturbances and cyclones across the northern Atlantic Ocean . The agency had access to the Hurricane Hunters , a fleet of aircraft that obtain data by flying into storms . The Weather Bureau , in collaboration with other agencies , began a five – year project in 1956 to obtain and analyze data on the structure of hurricanes . The season officially ended on November 15 . 
 There were a total of twelve tropical storms during the season , five of which were unnamed . Of all the storms , four were hurricanes . Compared to the average activity from the previous two decades , the season 's activity was below normal despite average sea surface temperatures and a normal number of tropical waves . Instead , the inactivity was the result of the subtropical ridge being located further south than normal , which decreased the atmospheric instability across much of the basin . Such a pattern was different from the more active 1954 and 1955 seasons . Several tropical depressions formed that did not attain tropical storm status , many of which formed beneath an unfavorable upper @-@ level trough . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 54 , which is categorized as being " below normal " . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots ( 39 mph , 63 km / h ) or tropical storm strength . Subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Tropical Storm One = = = 
 = = = Tropical Storm Two = = = 
 In early June , a trough extended from the Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean . On June 12 , the interaction between the trough and a tropical wave spawned a tropical depression in the Bay of Campeche . The newly developed tropical cyclone tracked northward , quickly intensifying into a tropical storm . It attained peak winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) on June 13 , although it never developed a well @-@ defined circulation . In addition , it had characteristics of both a tropical and extratropical cyclone , with cooler air aloft . Late on June 13 , the storm made landfall near Cocodrie , Louisiana , and its lowest pressure of 1 @,@ 001 millibars ( 29 @.@ 56 inHg ) was measured over land , suggesting it did not weaken substantially after landfall . After moving inland , it dissipated on June 15 over Arkansas . 
 As the storm moved ashore , it did not develop rainbands , unlike other tropical cyclones . The heaviest rainfall occurred in a 100 mi ( 160 km ) region east of where it moved ashore . Precipitation fell across the entire United States gulf coast , and the highest rainfall total was 8 @.@ 89 in ( 226 mm ) in Golden Meadow , Louisiana . The rains were beneficial to farmers , due to drought conditions persisting in the region . The storm produced higher than normal tides , peaking at 4 @.@ 7 ft ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) in Biloxi , Mississippi ; this was the highest since the 1947 Fort Lauderdale hurricane . The tides left damage to the Freeport Sulphur Company , as well as to boats , beaches , and piers . Three people died after their boat capsized , and there was another death after a driver skidded off the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway . A barge in the lake became disabled due to the storm and caused light damage to the causeway . Sustained winds during the storm 's passage peaked at 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) near Grand Isle , Louisiana , and a boat reported a gust of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) near Pilottown , Louisiana . Damage was estimated at $ 50 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = June tropical depression = = = 
 Shortly after the previous storm dissipated , another tropical depression developed on June 17 from a trough , about 500 mi ( 800 km ) east of the southern Florida coast . Although it briefly produced wind gusts of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) , it never intensified beyond tropical depression status , and it dissipated on June 18 . 
 = = = July tropical depression = = = 
 A weak circulation developed late on July 4 beneath a cold mid @-@ level trough in the Gulf of Mexico . It moved north @-@ northwestward , and hit near Pensacola , Florida on July 6 . It dissipated on July 9 . Although it never intensified beyond tropical depression status , the system produced wind gusts of 47 mph ( 76 km / h ) in Panama City , Florida . As it moved ashore , the depression dropped heavy amounts of precipitation , with a total of 14 @.@ 22 in ( 361 mm ) reported in Whatley , Alabama . The rains washed away or eroded several highways and bridges , and also resulted in some agricultural damage . A train line from Mobile to Birmingham , Alabama , was washed out near <unk> . Overall the damage was estimated at $ 503 @,@ 000 , and there were no associated deaths . 
 = = = Hurricane Anna = = = 
 A westward @-@ moving tropical wave traversed the Lesser Antilles on July 20 . It moved across the Caribbean , and its thunderstorms increased on July 23 while passing south of Cuba and beneath a high pressure area . There is evidence that it could have developed a circulation on July 24 before it struck the Yucatán Peninsula . It is confirmed to have developed into a tropical depression on July 25 in the Bay of Campeche . As it continued west @-@ northwestward , it rapidly intensified into Tropical Storm Anna , and before moving ashore in Mexico near <unk> , Veracruz , on July 26 it attained hurricane status . Peak winds reached 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) , although Anna rapidly dissipated on July 27 as it moved further inland . The high winds wrecked several homes in poor regions of Tampico , Tamaulipas , while rainfall of 2 @.@ 5 in ( 64 mm ) resulted in flooding . The high winds severed telegraph lines from Tampico to San Luis Potosí . The same area was affected by several hurricanes in the previous year . Damage totaled around $ 50 @,@ 000 , and there were no deaths . 
 = = = Hurricane Betsy = = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 4 . It developed into Tropical Storm Betsy developed on August 9 to the east of the Lesser Antilles . It rapidly developed into a 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) hurricane before striking Guadeloupe with a minimum central pressure of 979 mb ( 28 @.@ 91 inHg ) . There , Betsy heavily damaged 1 @,@ 000 houses and left severe crop destruction , and led to 18 deaths . As Betsy continued into the northeastern Caribbean , it capsized a ship , killing its crew of two . On August 12 , a slightly weakened Betsy struck southeastern Puerto Rico near Maunabo with winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) and quickly crossed the island . Damage was heaviest where it moved ashore and in the territory 's central portion . 15 @,@ 023 houses were destroyed by Betsy , and multiple locations reported heavy crop damage , including Camuy , which reported a complete loss of the corn crop . 
 After exiting Puerto Rico , Betsy strengthened steadily as it headed generally northwestward , becoming a major hurricane on August 13 while centered north of the Turks and Caicos Islands . It attained peak winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) the next day to the east of the Bahamas . Betsy later turned northeastward , attaining its lowest central pressure of 954 mbar ( 28 @.@ 17 inHg ) on August 17 . It later became extratropical early on August 18 . The remnants dissipated two days later to the north of the Azores . Hurricane Betsy was the first hurricane to be observed from the San Juan radar , and also resulted in the first hurricane warning on the island that was released on television . The hurricane left $ 40 million in damage and 16 deaths , which prompted the declaration of a federal disaster area . Locally the hurricane was known as the Santa Clara Hurricane . 
 = = = August tropical depression = = = 
 A vigorous tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on August 28 near the Cape Verde islands . As it passed through the islands , the depression produced a minimum central pressure of 1 @,@ 004 mbar ( 29 @.@ 6 inHg ) on the island of Sal . Ships in the area reported winds as strong as 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) . The depression maintained a general westward track , eventually dissipating on September 6 to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Carla = = = 
 The origins of Tropical Storm Carla were from a tropical wave that spawned a depression near the Bahamas on September 7 . It moved generally to the north , intensifying to a tropical storm the following day . An upper @-@ level low located to the northeast of Carla produced hostile conditions that prevented significant strengthening , and Carla had a structure which resembled a subtropical storm . An approaching cold front turned the storm to the northeast , and despite the unfavorable atmosphere , Carla intensified , reaching peak winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) late on September 9 . The interaction between the storm and a high pressure system over the Great Lakes yielded a strong pressure gradient that produced gale force winds over New England . After Carla passed to the north of Bermuda , it became extratropical on September 10 , according to HURDAT — the official hurricane database — and the annual report in the Monthly Weather Review . As a post @-@ tropical cyclone , ex @-@ Carla strengthened to 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) before weakening and dissipating by September 16 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Dora = = = 
 On September 10 , a tropical depression developed over the Bay of Campeche . Later that day , Hurricane Hunters observed winds of tropical storm force , indicating that the depression had become Tropical Storm Dora , with winds of about 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . Dora moved generally westward due to a ridge to its north . A reconnaissance flight on September 11 estimated hurricane @-@ force winds , but reanalysis assessed these as being unrepresentative of Dora 's true strength . Early on September 12 , Dora peaked at 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) shortly before striking land near Tuxpan with a minimum central pressure of 1 @,@ 000 mb ( 29 @.@ 53 inHg ) . It quickly dissipated early the next day , although the storm produced heavy rains across the region . The deluge caused a landslide as well as flooding , including along a river near San Andrés Tuxtla . In Puebla , there were 13 deaths and 20 injuries after a bus crashed into a washed out portion of the highway from Tuxpan to Mexico City . Overall , Dora caused 27 deaths in the country , but minor damage . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Ethel = = = 
 On September 11 , a tropical depression developed along the southern end of a quasi @-@ stationary cold front over Grand Exuma Island in the Bahamas . It moved to the northeast and encountered cold air from the north . This resulted in significant instability that allowed in quick strengthening . A Hurricane Hunters flight on September 12 reported winds of 76 mph ( 122 km / h ) in the storm 's northeast quadrant ; as a result , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Ethel . The flight observed a well @-@ developed eye 20 mi ( 32 km ) in diameter , although they only observed hurricane @-@ force winds in one quadrant . Reassessment , however , discounted the observations of hurricane @-@ force winds from the aircraft as being unrepresentative of Ethel 's strength , and analyzed that Ethel peaked at 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) late on September 12 , with the lowest pressure reported being 999 mbar ( 29 @.@ 50 inHg ) . Shortly after reaching peak intensity , Ethel began weakening and dissipated on September 14 to the southwest of Bermuda . 
 = = = September tropical depression = = = 
 A vigorous tropical depression moved through the Cape Verde islands on September 13 , although the complete history of the cyclone is unknown . It dissipated before affecting the Lesser Antilles . 
 = = = Hurricane Flossy = = = 
 The origin of Flossy is uncertain ; one possibility is it developed from a system in the eastern Pacific , and the other is from a disturbance moving through the Caribbean . A tropical depression formed on September 20 just east of the Yucatán Peninsula and headed northwest across the landmass . Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico on September 22 , it quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Flossy . Continuing to intensify , the storm turned to the north and attained hurricane status on September 23 . Bearing winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) , Flossy struck near Venice , Louisiana , on September 24 after turning to the northeast , crossing the Mississippi River Delta . The hurricane again moved into the Gulf of Mexico , continuing to the northeast and intensifying further until moving ashore near Miramar Beach , Florida , on September 25 as a strong Category 1 hurricane with winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 974 mbar ( 28 @.@ 76 inHg ) . Later that day , Flossy became extratropical over Georgia after weakening into a tropical storm . The extratropical remnants moved through the southeast United States and emerged from North Carolina into the western Atlantic on September 27 . The storm was last observed on October 3 , near southernmost Newfoundland . 
 Flossy was the only hurricane of the season to strike the United States . Winds in Louisiana reached 84 mph ( 135 km / h ) , although an oil rig offshore Grand Isle reported a gust of 95 mph ( 153 km / h ) . The storm dropped heavy rainfall along its path , peaking at 16 @.@ 7 in ( 420 mm ) in Golden Meadow , Louisiana . The rainfall and the hurricane 's accompanying storm surge caused widespread flooding and beach erosion in southeast Louisiana . The flooding surmounted the eastern seawall in New Orleans , submerging an area of 2 @.@ 5 sq mi ( 6 @.@ 5 km2 ) . Across the region , the resulting flooding drowned cattle and caused heavy crop damage . Hurricane Flossy left about $ 27 @.@ 8 million in damage ( 1956 USD ) , mostly from crop damage , as well as 15 deaths . The rainfall extended through the Mid @-@ Atlantic states , which alleviated drought conditions . 
 = = = October South Atlantic depression = = = 
 On October 9 , a tropical depression developed about 1 @,@ 300 mi ( 2 @,@ 100 km ) east of Puerto Rico . Ships in the area reported winds as strong as 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) , although the system dissipated within 24 hours . 
 = = = October Mid @-@ Atlantic depression = = = 
 On October 10 , another tropical depression formed further to the north of the previous storm . It possibly developed from the same tropical wave that spawned the previous depression , although they were not the same system . The depression maintained a general northward movement throughout its duration , dissipating on October 12 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Nine = = = 
 = = = Tropical Storm Ten = = = 
 A low pressure area formed along a dissipating cold front to the north of Puerto Rico . The system moved westward , developing some tropical characteristics by October 13 . The next day , the system became a tropical storm over the Straits of Florida . On October 15 , it crossed over South Florida near Homestead with winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . The storm was never fully tropical , as its winds and precipitation extended far away from the center . The storm intensified further over the Florida peninsula , peaking at 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) early on October 16 . After affecting Florida , the storm crossed the western Atlantic and moved across the Outer Banks . The storm became extratropical on October 17 , and the next day it was absorbed by another extratropical storm . 
 The storm produced significant rainfall in a 50 mi ( 80 km ) region of Florida . The highest total in the state was 16 @.@ 28 in ( 414 mm ) in Kissimmee . There , the rains caused flash flooding that entered over 200 houses . The flooding flooded three state highways , and also left portions of Okeechobee inaccessible after reporting the heaviest rainfall in eight years . Large tomato fields were inundated , resulting in some crop damage . In portions of the state , the rains were beneficial due to previously dry conditions . The storm spawned a tornado in North Miami that injured one person . Damage throughout Florida was estimated at $ 3 million , mostly in the Kissimmee area . In addition , two surfers drowned during the storm . Precipitation extended as far north as New Jersey , and coastal areas experienced high tides and gusty winds .

 The intertropical convergence zone spawned a tropical depression on October 31 a short distance to south of easternmost Cuba . The system tracked northward and crossed over eastern Cuba , and the system initially had characteristics of an extratropical cyclone . It eventually acquired tropical features and intensified into Tropical Storm Greta on November 1 . A high pressure area east of the Mid @-@ Atlantic states caused the depression to turn to the south on November 2 and loop to the southeast . Later that day the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Greta to the northeast of the Bahamas . It attained hurricane status on November 4 while maintaining a large size ( in fact , becoming one of the largest tropical cyclones known in the Atlantic basin ) ; such strengthening is unusual in storms moving in a southeast trajectory . Greta turned to the east and later northeast , reaching its peak of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) late on November 4 due to the energy transfer between levels of the atmosphere . Cooler waters caused subsequent weakening and gradual loss of tropical characteristics , and Greta transitioned into an extratropical storm on November 6 , dissipating the next day . 
 The extremely large size of Greta , in conjunction with the high pressure system to its north , produced strong winds and high waves across a large area of the western Atlantic . In Puerto Rico , waves of 20 ft ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) left heavy damage and killed one person who did not heed an evacuation order . Waves reached 25 ft ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) in the French West Indies , which destroyed 80 % of the structures at the port in Basse @-@ Terre , Guadeloupe . Further west , high waves left heavy damage in and around the beaches of Jacksonville , Florida . Overall damage was estimated at about $ 3 @.@ 58 million .

 KMFDM ( originally Kein Mitleid Für Die Mehrheit , " loosely " translated by the band as " no pity for the majority " ) is an industrial band led by German multi @-@ instrumentalist Sascha Konietzko , who founded the group in 1984 as a performance art project . 
 The group 's earliest incarnation included German drummer En Esch and British vocalist Raymond Watts , the latter of whom left and rejoined the group several times over its history . The trio recorded the band 's earliest albums in Germany before Konietzko and Esch moved to the United States , where they found much greater success with seminal industrial record label Wax Trax ! . German guitarist Günter Schulz joined in 1990 ; both he and Esch continued with the band until KMFDM broke up in 1999 . Konietzko resurrected KMFDM in 2002 ( Esch and Schulz declined to rejoin ) on Metropolis Records , and by 2005 he had assembled a consistent line @-@ up that included American singer Lucia Cifarelli , British guitarists Jules Hodgson and Steve White , and British drummer Andy Selway . Konietzko and Cifarelli moved back to Germany in 2007 , while the rest of band stayed in the U.S. In addition to these core members , dozens of other musicians have worked with the group across its nineteen studio albums and two dozen singles , with sales totaling in excess of two million records worldwide . 
 Critics consider KMFDM to be one of the first bands to bring industrial music to mainstream audiences , though Konietzko refers to the band 's music as " The Ultra @-@ Heavy Beat " . The band incorporates heavy metal guitar riffs , electronic music , samples , and both male and female vocals in its music , which encompasses a variety of styles including industrial rock and electronic body music . The band is fiercely political , with many of its lyrics taking stands against violence , war , and oppression . KMFDM normally tours at least once after every major release , and band members are known for their accessibility to and interaction with fans , both online and at concerts . Members , singly or working together and with other musicians , have recorded under many other names , primarily Watts ' Pig , Konietzko 's Excessive Force , and Esch and Schulz 's Slick Idiot . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origin ( 1984 ) = = = 
 KMFDM was officially founded in Paris , France , on February 29 , 1984 , as a performance art project between Sascha Konietzko and German painter and multimedia artist Udo Sturm at the opening of an exhibition of young European artists at the Grand Palais . The first show consisted of Sturm playing an ARP 2600 synthesizer , Konietzko playing vacuum cleaners and bass guitars with their amplifiers spread throughout the building , and four Polish coal miners ( whom Konietzko had met at a bordello ) pounding on the foundations of the Grand Palais . 
 = = = = Name = = = = 
 KMFDM is an initialism for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect German phrase Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid , which literally translates as " no majority for the pity " , but is typically given the loose translation of " no pity for the majority " . In the original phrase , the articles preceding the nouns Mehrheit and Mitleid are inflected for the wrong gender , as the proper declension would be Keine Mehrheit für das Mitleid . Swapping the two nouns yields the grammatically correct Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit , which translates directly as " no pity for the majority " . In a 2003 interview , Konietzko explained the origins of the phrase : 
 " On the morning of February 29th , 1984 I woke up and went down to breakfast at a hotel in Paris . We had a show that night opening for an exhibition for young European artists . ... we needed a motto for the night so that we could make up some fliers and post them around . There was a German newspaper on the table and so I started cutting out words and threw them all into a cap . We picked a few of them out and it read " Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid " . It 's kinda improper German in regards to its translation but in the DA @-@ DA @-@ esque [ sic ] mindset of the early morning it made perfect sense . So when I was on my way back to Hamburg I 'd mentioned it to Raymond [ Watts ] . He liked it but he was having difficulty pronouncing it correctly . So finally he said , ' Why don 't you just call it KMFDM ? ' So that was it . We were KMFDM . " 
 = = = Early years in Germany ( 1984 – 89 ) = = = 
 Sturm left early on , but Konietzko continued performing , at one point having twenty people in his troupe , which by then was engaged in antics such as fire eating and throwing entrails at audiences . Konietzko then returned to Hamburg , where he joined up with Peter Missing in his new band Missing Foundation . Drummer Nicklaus <unk> , who had recently moved to Hamburg from Frankfurt , also joined the group , and took the stage name En Esch . Although the group did some live performances , Konietzko and Esch dropped out of Missing Foundation before any recordings were made and went back to work as KMFDM , collaborating with Hamburg @-@ based studio owner Raymond Watts . 
 Cassette copies of the band 's first album , Opium , began circulating through the underground clubs and bars of Hamburg in 1984 . KMFDM released its next album , What Do You Know , Deutschland ? , in December 1986 . It was recorded from 1983 to 1986 , with some of the songs recorded by Konietzko and Watts before Esch was a member of the band , and indeed , before the band officially existed . Skysaw Records gave the album a second UK release in 1987 and introduced the band to visual artist Aidan Hughes , usually credited as Brute ! . Hughes redesigned the album 's cover , and went on to design almost every KMFDM album cover . 
 Watts left the group after working on just three songs on 1988 's Don 't Blow Your Top to start his own project , Pig . After working the Hamburg underground music scene and releasing albums on European labels , the band began its long @-@ standing relationship with Wax Trax ! Records when Don 't Blow Your Top was licensed to the label for US distribution . The album was produced by Adrian Sherwood , and was described by AllMusic critic Dave Thompson as " [ highlighting ] the producer as much as the band " . 
 = = = Success in America ( 1990 – 94 ) = = = 
 KMFDM recorded and released its fourth album , <unk> , in early 1989 for distribution in both the U.S. and Europe , arrived in America for the first time on December 16 , and commenced touring the U.S. with Ministry . During KMFDM 's first US tour , band members started using the phrase " Kill <unk> Depeche Mode " for the acronym to tease journalists who did not understand German . The band signed directly to Wax Trax ! to distribute its fifth album , Naïve , which was recorded in Europe and featured the debut of guitarist Günter Schulz , known at the time as Svetlana Ambrosius . A remix of the album 's title track was the group 's first hit , reaching No. 21 on Billboard 's Dance / Club Play Songs Chart in March 1991 . 
 Konietzko moved to Chicago in 1991 , and Esch followed a year later . KMFDM quickly became a part of the Chicago industrial music scene that included Ministry , My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult , and Revolting Cocks . Konietzko later remarked , " We came from Germany and we all had to have day jobs and work our asses off to afford to be KMFDM and all of a sudden were in the states and were selling thousands of thousands of [ sic ] fucking records ! " 
 The band 's next club hit was " Split " , which was released in June 1991 and reached No. 46 on Billboard 's Dance / Club Play Songs Chart in July . During 1991 , Konietzko collaborated with Buzz McCoy of My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult to record an album under the name Excessive Force entitled Conquer Your World . Konietzko and Esch then began work on their halves of the intended sixth album , Apart , which was eventually released as two separate albums . Esch 's half became his solo album , Cheesy , while the official KMFDM album used Konietzko 's material and was renamed Money . This album spawned two more club hits in 1992 : " Vogue " , which reached No. 19 on the Billboard Dance / Club Play Songs Chart in April , and the title track , which reached No. 36 on that same chart in July . 
 After touring in 1992 with drummer Chris Vrenna , the then @-@ core of KMFDM ( Konietzko , Esch , Schulz , and second guitarist Mark Durante ) returned to Chicago and found that Wax Trax ! had filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy to begin corporate reorganization in November 1992 . The band went into the studio in 1993 as a group to record its seventh album , Angst , which sold more than 100 @,@ 000 copies over the next two years . Esch said after the album 's release , " I like this album way more . Money was done in a hurry , and I was doing a major Pigface tour , so I didn 't have much influence on the album . I really like Angst . I 'm totally down with it . We 've tried to involve guitar players , we tried to be like a real band , especially in the creative kind of aspect . " After the release of Angst , Wax Trax ! / TVT Records launched a promotion in which fans were encouraged to devise as many alternate meanings for KMFDM as possible , with more than a thousand submissions resulting . 
 Konietzko released a second album under the Excessive Force moniker in 1993 entitled Gentle Death . KMFDM received its first exposure to the mainstream with its single " A Drug Against War " . Despite the band 's anti @-@ MTV stance , the video of " A Drug Against War " received airplay on MTV and was shown on the MTV cartoon Beavis and Butt @-@ head . The track " Light " reached No. 31 on the Billboard Dance / Club Play Songs Chart in May 1994 . 
 The song " Liebeslied " from Naïve originally contained an unlicensed sample of " O Fortuna " from Carl Orff 's Carmina Burana . Orff 's publisher threatened the band with legal action , and the album was withdrawn from production in 1993 . A new version of the album , entitled Naïve / Hell to Go , was released the following year . It contained new mixes of several songs , including a version of " Liebeslied " with the offending sample removed . 
 Wax Trax ! was saved from bankruptcy by an infusion of funds from TVT Records , and in March 1994 announced plans to release the compilation set Black Box – Wax Trax ! Records : The First 13 Years , which includes the KMFDM songs " Virus " and " Godlike " , two songs which Thompson called " defining " . 
 = = = Peak popularity ( 1994 – 99 ) = = = 
 The mid @-@ to @-@ late 1990s were KMFDM 's most successful years in terms of album sales and mainstream awareness . Konietzko moved to Seattle in 1994 , while Esch moved to New Orleans . Watts rejoined the band to work on its eighth album , Nihil , which peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and sold over 120 @,@ 000 copies . It marked the first contributions by drummer Bill Rieflin , who worked with the band on its next five albums . Nihil featured KMFDM 's most widely known song , " Juke Joint Jezebel " , versions of which appeared on both the Bad Boys and Mortal Kombat soundtracks , the latter of which peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 and sold over 1 @.@ 8 million copies . 
 Commenting on the rotating cast of musicians shortly after Nihil 's release , Konietzko said , " It 's as if En and I are the suns and the other musicians at the time come and revolve around us . " Regarding the duo 's dynamic , Konietzko said , " En Esch and myself have always been the cornerstone of KMFDM 's existence . And we are diametrically opposed as writers . The angsty stuff generally comes from him . The poppy , hard stuff comes from me . " Esch commented in 1994 , " Sascha and myself are different , of course . But that 's why we can still make things happen . Our best and worst qualities are contrary . To put it simply , he 's more organized and stable , I 'm more complicated and abstract . " 
 In late 1995 , close friend and president of Chicago 's Wax Trax ! Jim Nash died of an illness complicated by AIDS , and Seattle became the official headquarters of KMFDM . Watts toured with KMFDM throughout 1995 in support of Nihil , but then left the group to return to recording under the Pig moniker . Esch also separated from the group , and Xtort was created in 1996 almost entirely without his input . Konietzko instead brought in a number of other industrial artists such as Chris Connelly to assist with the album . Xtort was the first KMFDM album to chart on the Billboard 200 and the highest @-@ charting and best @-@ selling album in the band 's history , reaching No. 92 and selling more than 200 @,@ 000 copies . " Power " , the album 's first single , was the most heavily promoted song in the band 's history , with almost 100 @,@ 000 copies included in a free Wax Trax ! sampler album in mid @-@ 1996 . Konietzko later said Xtort was his favorite album of the 1990s . 
 Esch returned for the Symbols album , which was released in 1997 and featured Abby Travis and Skinny Puppy 's Nivek Ogre . Symbols reached No. 137 on the Billboard 200 . Its first track , " <unk> " , was featured in the film Mortal Kombat : Annihilation , and was the first song from its soundtrack to receive radio airplay . Tim Skold , formerly of the band Shotgun Messiah , made his first appearance as a band member , writing lyrics and performing vocals on " Anarchy " . Looking back on Symbols in 2002 , Konietzko said , " I listened to the Symbols album and heard exactly why KMFDM broke up in the first place . It told me the story of what went wrong . There were maybe two ( good ) songs on that album and the others were just a bunch of compromising tug @-@ of @-@ wars . That was something I was not going to do again . " 
 The band released a pair of compilation albums in 1998 . The first , Retro , was a greatest hits compilation which included most of the singles released up until Xtort . The second , <unk> , was a collection of rarities and previously unreleased tracks , including a cover of U2 's " Mysterious Ways " . 
 = = = Adios ( 1999 ) = = = 
 The album Adios was written and performed almost exclusively by Konietzko and Skold . Ogre again provided vocals , as did German musician Nina Hagen . Originally the fulfillment of the band 's ten record contract with Wax Trax ! / TVT , Adios later signaled the breakup of the band itself , which Esch 's and Schulz 's limited participation foreshadowed . 
 KMFDM disbanded , albeit temporarily , on January 22 , 1999 , with only Konietzko and Skold remaining together . Konietzko said the split was due to " lots of stress and pressure , as well as differences in vision and drive " . Esch said " There was a lot of negative energy between Sascha and Günter Schulz and myself and we all decided on the phone to call the band quits . " Adios was released three months later , and reached No. 189 on the Billboard 200 . Its title track was called " a bitter goodbye " . 
 In the wake of the Columbine High School massacre , it was revealed that lyrics to KMFDM songs ( " Son of a Gun " , " Stray Bullet " , " Waste " ) were posted on the website of shooter Eric Harris , and that the date of the massacre , April 20 , coincided with both the release date of the album Adios and the birthday of Adolf Hitler . Some journalists were quick to jump on the apparent connection of the massacre to violent entertainment and Nazism , though one wrote , " Lyrically , the band has written some songs that could easily be misconstrued by anyone lacking an ear for irony and looking for an excuse to commit violence . " In response , Konietzko issued a statement : 
 " First and foremost , KMFDM would like to express their deep and heartfelt sympathy for the parents , families and friends of the murdered and injured children in Littleton . We are sick and appalled , as is the rest of the nation , by what took place in Colorado yesterday . 
 " KMFDM are an art form — not a political party . From the beginning , our music has been a statement against war , oppression , fascism and violence against others . While some of the former band members are German as reported in the media , none of us condone any Nazi beliefs whatsoever . " 
 = = = MDFMK , Slick Idiot , and reformation ( 2000 – 02 ) = = = 
 After the group disbanded , Schulz and Esch formed the band Slick Idiot , while Konietzko and Skold regrouped as MDFMK , adding singer Lucia Cifarelli to form a trio . MDFMK released one self @-@ titled album with Republic / Universal Records , and toured North America . After being released from his contract with Universal due to a disagreement over who would produce the next album , Konietzko said he called Metropolis Records and asked if they 'd be interested in signing KMFDM . The label agreed , although at the time only Konietzko himself was certain to participate . 
 KMFDM reformed in 2002 with Konietzko , Skold , Cifarelli , and former collaborators Watts and Rieflin , due to " public demand " according to Konietzko , who said at the time , " I talked with the usual KMFDM suspects to see if they were interested , and what we came up with was something better than what we had before . " Recalled Esch in 2009 , " I was happy about my new creative freedom at that time and so I refused the concept of a fast reunion of the original KMFDM . " Konietzko said of the reformed band , " Not only is it fun again , but it 's devoid of all the personal confrontations due to egos and fractions that were once a part of the band , " but said , " I really miss En Esch , " in 2003 . KMFDM released its first album in three years , Attak , in March 2002 . The album was on the Billboard Independent Albums Chart for four weeks , peaking at No. 11 . 
 = = = New line @-@ up ( 2003 – 07 ) = = = 
 Skold left after Attak to join Marilyn Manson . Over the next few years , Watts ' bandmates from Pig joined KMFDM one by one . Jules Hodgson had already done guitar work for 2002 's Attak . Andy Selway first played drums for KMFDM on WWIII in 2003 , and Steve White contributed to 2005 's Hau Ruck after touring with the band . All three , along with Watts and Cifarelli , were mentioned as band members on " Intro " , the final track on WWIII , although that was to be the last album on which Watts performed . WWIII was on Billboard 's Dance / Electronic Albums Chart for seven weeks , and peaked at No. 3 . 
 Opium was re @-@ released in 2002 as <unk> on the band 's new label , KMFDM Records , and a collection of songs recorded between 1984 – 86 was released in 2004 . Shortly after the release of WWIII , Konietzko began work on the soundtrack for 2004 's Spider @-@ Man 2 video game . Hau Ruck performed about as well WWIII , appearing on Billboard 's Dance / Electronic Albums Chart for eight weeks but only hitting No. 5 . Unlike WWIII , Hau Ruck showed up on the Billboard Independent Albums chart for a single week at No. 48 . A companion EP , Ruck <unk> , was released in 2006 . 
 Konietzko took a new approach for Tohuvabohu , released in 2007 . " Principally in the past , there used to be 2 people that would start songs : me and Jules . On this record I said to the other 2 guys , Andy ( Selway ) and Steve ( White ) , ' Why don 't you guys come up with something ? ' " Tohuvabohu was on Billboard 's Dance / Electronic Albums Chart for just three weeks and peaked at No. 4 . It appeared on the Independent Albums Chart for one week at No. 29 . Tohuvabohu also had a companion , <unk> , a full length remix album released in 2008 that barely made it onto Billboard 's Dance / Electronic Albums Chart , hitting No. 20 for a single week . 
 Metropolis Records announced in mid @-@ 2006 it would reissue KMFDM 's entire Wax Trax ! -era studio album back catalog , which had been out of print since the early 2000s . The albums were released in chronological order in groups of two or three from September 2006 to May 2007 . Konietzko said the remastering was done over concerns about losing the rights to the back catalog after TVT defaulted on a loan , explaining , " The original agreement was that the catalog would have reverted back to me in 2008 , anyway , but TVT and Rykodisc were thinking of just making a KMFDM compilation , which would have eliminated my catalog , and I didn 't want that . " Konietzko commented in 2006 that the current line @-@ up was the best he had worked with , and said in a separate interview that his former bandmates were " looking at me for handouts " . Konietzko announced in October 2007 that he was packing up and moving back to Germany in the next three months .

 Following the Finnish school shootings of 2007 and 2008 , media reports again attempted to draw a connection between the shooters and the band , and noted that both listed KMFDM among their favorite bands . In an interview with Norwegian broadcaster NRK shortly after the 2008 incident , Konietzko responded to these claims by saying the recent shootings were a by @-@ product of the copycat mentality and the Finnish shooters ' desire to emulate the lifestyles and actions of the Columbine shooters . " One of my biggest concerns immediately following this incident [ the Columbine shooting ] was that there would be copycats repeating such things in the future , as there often are when people commit heinous crimes and acts of violence . I was , unfortunately , right . " 
 KMFDM re @-@ released all of its old singles and hard @-@ to @-@ find tracks from before the 1999 breakup in a series of three double albums called Extra — Vol . 1 , Vol . 2 , and Vol . 3 — in mid @-@ 2008 . KMFDM Records released Skold vs. KMFDM in early 2009 , which was a collaboration that Skold and Konietzko conducted over the Internet while on separate continents from June to October 2008 . A follow @-@ up is planned , but is not a high priority . 
 KMFDM 's sixteenth studio album , Blitz , released in March 2009 , showcased further collaboration with Skold , but less input from the band members not living in Germany . It reached No. 4 on Billboard 's Dance / Electronic Albums Chart , and was on the chart for four weeks . Its companion remix album , Krieg , was released in early 2010 . Two compilation albums , <unk> and Greatest Shit , were released in September that same year . 
 On December 14 , 2010 , the official KMFDM website was changed to include a single image with the text " All Systems Have Been Ripped . The Internet Has Been Shut Down . " A new song titled " Rebels in Control " became available for listening and download on the site , posted in support of Julian Assange with regards to the controversy over WikiLeaks . 
 Former band members Durante , Esch , Schulz , and Watts appeared with Mona Mur at the April 2011 Wax Trax ! <unk> in Chicago , a charity event celebrating the industrial music label . The group performed KMFDM songs from the Wax Trax ! era , including " Juke Joint Jezebel " , " Godlike , " Brute " , and " Don 't Blow Your Top " . Konietzko expressed a desire to perform with the current band line @-@ up , but was turned down by event organizers . 
 KMFDM released WTF ? ! in April 2011 , featuring what Konietzko called " a slew of guest musicians " including Rieflin , Koichi Fukuda , Free Dominguez , and William Wilson . The album 's first single , " Krank " , charted in both Germany and the United States . WTF ? ! was on Billboard 's Dance / Electronic Albums Chart for one week at No. 8 . 
 Work on KMFDM 's eighteenth album began in February 2012 . Titled Kunst , it was released on February 26 , 2013 . The band toured the United States in March and Europe in April 2013 . KMFDM reissued Opium and WWIII in October 2013 . 
 On May 24 , 2014 , Konietzko announced on the band 's Facebook page that a new album , entitled Our Time Will Come , would be released on October 14 , 2014 . A new live album entitled We Are KMFDM and a single called " <unk> ( The German in You ) " were also announced . Our Time Will Come was released on October 14 , 2014 , on both CD and vinyl . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 KMFDM 's earliest output was performance art , as Konietzko incorporated not only visuals such as burning beds and exploding televisions , but also non @-@ musical devices used as instruments , e.g. vacuum cleaners . The 1980s albums featured heavy use of sampling and studio manipulations , and the primary instruments used were synthesizers and drum machines . Konietzko has cited T.Rex , David Bowie , and Frank Zappa as inspiration in the early stages of KMFDM . Before forming the band , he listened to punk music and " true industrial " bands such as Throbbing Gristle . 
 The band 's music has been described as industrial , industrial rock , industrial metal , and techno @-@ industrial . While recognized along with Ministry , Nine Inch Nails , and Skinny Puppy as pioneers in introducing industrial music to mainstream audiences , KMFDM describes its sound as " The Ultra @-@ Heavy Beat " . Konietzko once stated , " If I was to give myself a label it would be industrial @-@ alternative @-@ electronic @-@ crossover @-@ rock and <unk> . " 
 The band has made heavy use of guitars since its inception , and pioneered their use during the band 's early days in Germany . Although not a metal fan , Konietzko said his " infatuation with ripping off metal licks " stemmed from his experiments with E @-@ mu 's Emax sampler in late 1986 , adding , " What I always hated most about heavy metal was that the best riffs came only once and were never repeated . So the fascination , actually , was to sample a great riff , loop it , and play it over and over again . " While the album Don 't Blow Your Top was more sparse in content , due to the influence of producer Sherwood , it was the exception rather than the rule . Ministry founder and frontman Al Jourgensen , on tour with the band in 1989 , described KMFDM as " a battalion of guitars marching through Europe . " 
 KMFDM 's music has since been a fusion of electronic and heavy metal , with occasional elements of dub , as well as orchestral samples and live horns . Many songs feature prominent backing vocals by female singers such as Dorona Alberti , Travis , and Cifarelli . Many of the musicians who have played in the band are multi @-@ instrumentalists , so there is a degree of versatility and freedom in the music . 
 Many albums feature one or more songs in which the band lampoons itself , notably in the lyrics to " Sucks " and " Inane " . The band 's " cynical detachment " has been compared to Steely Dan . Lyrics often express political concerns and call for the rejection of and resistance to terrorism , violence , oppression , censorship , and war . In the 1995 song " Terror " , Konietzko specifically warns , " Fundamentalist forces are undermining the integrity of liberal and democratic political structures " . Samples of news broadcasts and speeches by political leaders are sometimes featured in songs . Konietzko has said that while the 2003 album WWIII is critical of then @-@ president George W. Bush , who was sampled extensively for the album , " It 's not an anti @-@ Bush record per se , it 's an anti @-@ stupidity record " , and , " If we had a message , it would be : Think for Yourself and Don 't Believe the Bullshit . "

 As of July 2007 , KMFDM had sold approximately two million records worldwide . Critics have been widely positive of KMFDM , though less enthusiastic about the band 's earliest work . What Do You Know , Deutschland ? was called " less energetic " and Don 't Blow Your Top was called " a little flimsy " in comparison to later albums by AllMusic critics Andy Hinds and Vincent Jeffries , respectively . <unk> , when the band 's sound began to develop , was called " more assured " by Hinds and " more representative of KMFDM 's true motives " by Thompson , who added that KMFDM 's guitar @-@ heavy sound inspired Ministry 's own embrace of the instrument after the bands toured together in 1990 . 
 The first major breakthrough in the band 's critical reception was 1990 's Naïve , called " one of their strongest releases " by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic , " brilliant " by fellow AllMusic critic Ned Raggett , " superb " by Hinds , and " the most fun ' industrial dance ' album ever " by Spin critic Chuck Eddy . The subsequent albums released in the 1990s were described as some of the band 's strongest by AllMusic critic Greg Prato , with their metal guitars , industrial beats , and dance floor sensibilities praised by Ira Robbins and CMJ New Music Monthly critic Heidi MacDonald . Michael Saunders of the Boston Globe said of the band : " It 's a small field , but KMFDM is tops in it : makers of dense , danceable , post @-@ industrial torrents of noise . The German band specializes in fabricating aural assaults that can be intimidating to the uninitiated . " MacDonald said in 1996 , " With Ministry gone grindcore , Skinny Puppy just gone , and Nine Inch Nails a brand name , KMFDM is now the standard bearer of industrial " , though Erlewine and Hinds felt the band was losing some steam towards the end of the decade . 
 Greg Rule declared in 1999 , after its temporary disbandment , that KMFDM had " produced nine high @-@ impact records that have earned them a large , loyal fanbase strewn across the planet . " Erlewine called the band " one of Wax Trax 's first industrial superstars " , " an underground sensation " , and " one of the major industrial bands of the ' 90s .

 KMFDM has released on average an album every year and a half , and usually tours at least once in support of each album . At most concert venues , KMFDM mingles with the fans before and after the show to sign autographs , pose for photos , and answer questions . Konietzko , who keeps in contact with fans via e @-@ mail and the band 's website , and band representatives have experimented with ways for fans to interact more directly . KMFDM launched " Horde " in 2002 , an exclusive fan club which gave members the opportunity to attend a private meet @-@ and @-@ greet with the band before every show , and allowed access to members @-@ only music and footage online . A featurette on the Horde fan club appears on the WWIII Live 2003 DVD . 
 In the 2004 <unk> project , an audience member was selected at each concert to record that night 's show , as well as some back @-@ stage antics , with a hand @-@ held digital video camera . The resulting footage was incorporated into the following year 's 20th Anniversary World Tour DVD , which included fan photos submitted to the KMFDM official website . KMFDM encouraged fans to call a special " <unk> " and leave a voice message in March 2007 . The song " Superpower " from 2007 's Tohuvabohu includes sound @-@ clips from these messages . The band used the <unk> project again for its 2011 " Kein Mitleid " tour in the United States .

 KMFDM has a long @-@ standing relationship with commercial artist Aidan " Brute ! " Hughes , who creates the artwork adorning almost all of the band 's albums and singles , which has been called " one of rock music 's most memorable cover art collections " . Hughes ' artwork is featured in KMFDM 's music videos for " A Drug Against War " and " Son of a Gun " , and on the band 's promotional t @-@ shirts . Art critic Brian Sherwin said Hughes is probably best known for the collection of KMFDM artwork he has created . 
 All of his work , which has been called " striking " , shares a distinct visual style inspired by Golden Age comic artists , Russian <unk> , Italian Futurists , and woodcut artists . In an interview with Sherwin , Hughes stated , " KMFDM have cornered the market in industrial post @-@ modern angst and so my work reflects that . " Hughes said that initially he based his work on the music , which caused " artistic block " . Konietzko gave him more freedom to use whatever themes he wished , resulting in the cover to Money , which Hughes said " was based upon my disillusionment with the street lifestyle I was experiencing at the time , and the art carries with it the implication that no matter what temptation lies in your path , you still gotta pay ! " 
 The only studio album covers not designed by Hughes are Opium , which consists of a black and white photo , and Nihil , which was designed by Francesca Sundsten , wife of drummer Rieflin .

 = Imperial Trans @-@ Antarctic Expedition = 
 The Imperial Trans @-@ Antarctic Expedition ( 1914 – 17 ) , also known as the Endurance Expedition , is considered the last major expedition of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration . Conceived by Sir Ernest Shackleton , the expedition was an attempt to make the first land crossing of the Antarctic continent . After the conquest of the South Pole by Roald Amundsen in 1911 , this crossing remained , in Shackleton 's words , the " one great main object of Antarctic journeyings " . The expedition failed to accomplish this objective , but became recognised instead as an epic feat of endurance . 
 Shackleton had served in the Antarctic in Captain Scott 's Discovery Expedition , 1901 – 04 , and had led the British Antarctic Expedition , 1907 – 09 . In this new venture he proposed to sail to the Weddell Sea and to land a shore party near Vahsel Bay , in preparation for a transcontinental march via the South Pole to the Ross Sea . A supporting group , the Ross Sea party , would meanwhile establish camp in McMurdo Sound , and from there lay a series of supply depots across the Ross Ice Shelf to the foot of the Beardmore Glacier . These depots would be essential for the transcontinental party 's survival , as the group would not be able to carry enough provisions for the entire crossing . The expedition required two ships : Endurance under Shackleton for the Weddell Sea party , and Aurora , under Aeneas Mackintosh , for the Ross Sea party . 
 Endurance became beset in the ice of the Weddell Sea before reaching Vahsel Bay , and drifted northward , held in the pack ice , throughout the Antarctic winter of 1915 . Eventually the ship was crushed and sunk , stranding its 28 @-@ man complement on the ice . After months spent in makeshift camps as the ice continued its northwards drift , the party took to the lifeboats to reach the inhospitable , uninhabited Elephant Island . Shackleton and five others then made an 800 @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 287 km ) open @-@ boat journey in the James Caird to reach South Georgia . From there , Shackleton was eventually able to mount a rescue of the men waiting on Elephant Island and bring them home without loss of life . On the other side of the continent , the Ross Sea party overcame great hardships to fulfil its mission . Aurora was blown from her moorings during a gale and was unable to return , leaving the shore party marooned without proper supplies or equipment . Nevertheless , the depots were laid , but three lives were lost before the party 's eventual rescue .

 Despite the public acclaim that had greeted Shackleton 's achievements during the Nimrod Expedition in 1907 – 09 , the explorer was unsettled , becoming — in the words of British skiing pioneer Sir Harry Brittain — " a bit of a floating gent " . By 1912 his future Antarctic plans depended on the results of Scott 's Terra Nova Expedition , which had left Cardiff in July 1910 , and on the concurrent Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen . The news of Amundsen 's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912 , to which he responded : " The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration " . The next work , he said , would be " a transcontinental journey from sea to sea , crossing the pole " . He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective . On 11 December 1911 , a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia , intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea . In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia , having failed to land and set up his base . However , his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay , at around 78 ° latitude , were noted by Shackleton , and incorporated into his developing expedition plans . 
 News of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913 . Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey . He solicited financial and practical support from , among others , <unk> Gran of Scott ’ s expedition , and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery , but received no help from either . Gran was evasive , and Rosebery blunt : " I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles " . Shackleton got support , however , from William Speirs Bruce , leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902 – 04 , who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908 , but had abandoned the project for lack of funds . Bruce generously allowed Shackleton to adopt his plans , although the eventual scheme announced by Shackleton owed little to Bruce . On 29 December 1913 , having acquired his first promises of financial backing — a £ 10 @,@ 000 grant from the British Government — Shackleton made his plans public , in a letter to The Times . 
 = = = Shackleton 's plan = = = 
 Shackleton called his new expedition the Imperial Trans @-@ Antarctic Expedition , because he felt that " not only the people of these islands , but our kinsmen in all the lands under the Union Jack will be willing to assist towards the carrying out of the ... programme of exploration . " To arouse the interest of the general public , Shackleton issued a detailed programme early in 1914 . The expedition was to consist of two parties and two ships . The Weddell Sea party would travel in the Endurance and continue to the Vahsel Bay area , where fourteen men would land of whom six , under Shackleton , would form the Transcontinental Party . This group , with 69 dogs , two motor sledges , and equipment " embodying everything that the experience of the leader and his expert advisers can suggest " , would undertake the 1 @,@ 800 @-@ mile ( 2 @,@ 900 km ) journey to the Ross Sea . The remaining eight shore party members would carry out scientific work , three going to Graham Land , three to Enderby Land and two remaining at base camp . 
 The Ross Sea party would set up its base in McMurdo Sound , on the opposite side of the continent . After landing they would lay depots on the route of the transcontinental party as far as the Beardmore Glacier , hopefully meeting that party there and assisting it home . They would also make geological and other observations . 
 = = = Finance = = = 
 Shackleton estimated that he would need £ 50 @,@ 000 ( current value £ 4 @,@ 327 @,@ 000 ) to carry out the simplest version of his plan . He did not believe in appeals to the public : " ( they ) cause endless book @-@ keeping worries " . His chosen method of fund @-@ raising was to solicit contributions from wealthy backers , and he had begun this process early in 1913 , with little initial success . The first significant encouragement came in December 1913 , when the Government offered him £ 10 @,@ 000 , provided he could raise an equivalent amount from private sources . The Royal Geographical Society , from which he had expected nothing , gave him £ 1 @,@ 000 — according to Huntford , Shackleton , in a grand gesture , advised them that he would only need to take up half of this sum . Lord Rosebery , who had previously expressed his lack of interest in polar expeditions , gave £ 50 . In February 1914 The New York Times reported that playwright J. M. Barrie – a close friend of Captain Scott – had confidentially donated $ 50 @,@ 000 ( about £ 10 @,@ 000 ) . With time running out , contributions were eventually secured during the spring and early summer of 1914 . Dudley Docker of the Birmingham Small Arms Company ( BSA ) gave £ 10 @,@ 000 , wealthy tobacco heiress Janet Stancomb @-@ Wills gave a " generous " sum ( the amount was not revealed ) , and , in June , Scottish industrialist Sir James Caird donated £ 24 @,@ 000 ( current value £ 2 @,@ 080 @,@ 000 ) . Shackleton informed the Morning Post that " this magnificent gift relieves me of all anxiety " . 
 Shackleton now had the money to proceed . He acquired , for £ 14 @,@ 000 ( current value £ 1 @,@ 210 @,@ 000 ) , a 300 @-@ ton barquentine called Polaris , which had been built for the Belgian explorer Adrien de Gerlache for an expedition to Spitsbergen . This scheme had collapsed and the ship became available . Shackleton changed her name to Endurance , reflecting his family motto " By endurance we conquer " . For a further £ 3 @,@ 200 ( current value £ 277 @,@ 000 ) , he acquired Douglas Mawson ’ s expedition ship Aurora , which was lying in Hobart , Tasmania . This would act as the Ross Sea party 's vessel . 
 How much money Shackleton raised to meet the total costs of the expedition ( later estimated by the Daily Mail to be around £ 80 @,@ 000 , is uncertain , since the size of the Stancomb @-@ Wills donation is not known . Money was a constant problem for Shackleton , who as an economy measure halved the funding allocated to the Ross Sea party , a fact which the party ’ s commander Aeneas Mackintosh only discovered when he arrived in Australia to take up his duties . Mackintosh was forced to <unk> and plead for money and supplies to make his part of the expedition viable . Shackleton had , however , realised the revenue @-@ earning potential of the expedition . He sold the exclusive newspaper rights to the Daily Chronicle , and formed the Imperial Trans Antarctic Film Syndicate to take advantage of the film rights .

 According to legend , Shackleton posted an advertisement in a London paper , stating : " Men wanted for hazardous journey . Low wages , bitter cold , long hours of complete darkness . Safe return doubtful . Honour and recognition in event of success . " Searches for the original advertisement have proved unsuccessful , and the story is generally regarded as apocryphal . Shackleton received more than 5 @,@ 000 applications for places on the expedition , including a letter from " three sporty girls " who suggested that if their feminine garb was inconvenient they would " just love to don masculine attire . " Eventually the crews for the two arms of the expedition were trimmed down to 28 apiece , including William Bakewell , who joined the ship in Buenos Aires , his friend Perce Blackborow who stowed away when his application was turned down , and several last @-@ minute appointments made to the Ross Sea party in Australia . A temporary crewman was Sir Daniel Gooch , grandson of the renowned railway pioneer of the same name , who stepped in to help Shackleton as a dog handler at the last moment and signed up for an able seaman 's pay . Gooch agreed to sail with Endurance as far as South Georgia . 
 As his second @-@ in @-@ command , Shackleton chose Frank Wild , who had been with him on both the Discovery and Nimrod expeditions , and was one of the Furthest South party in 1909 . Wild had just returned from Mawson ’ s Australian Antarctic Expedition . To captain Endurance Shackleton had wanted John King Davis , who had commanded Aurora during the Australian Antarctic Expedition . Davis refused , thinking the enterprise was " foredoomed " , so the appointment went to Frank Worsley , who claimed to have applied to the expedition after learning of it in a dream . Royal Navy Chief Petty Officer Tom Crean , who had been awarded the Albert Medal for saving the life of Lieutenant Evans on the Terra Nova Expedition , took leave from the navy to sign on as Endurance 's Second Officer ; another experienced Antarctic hand , Alfred Cheetham , became Third Officer . Two Nimrod veterans were assigned to the Ross Sea party : Mackintosh who commanded it , and Ernest Joyce . Shackleton had hoped that the Aurora would be staffed by a naval crew , and had asked the Admiralty for officers and men , but was turned down . After pressing his case , Shackleton was given one officer from the Royal Marines , Captain Thomas Orde @-@ Lees , who was Superintendent of Physical Training at the Marines training depot . 
 The scientific staff of six accompanying Endurance comprised the two surgeons , Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy ; a geologist , James Wordie ; a biologist , Robert Clark ; a physicist Reginald James ; and Leonard Hussey , a meteorologist who would eventually edit Shackleton ’ s expedition account South . The visual record of the expedition was the responsibility of its photographer Frank Hurley and its artist George Marston . The final composition of the Ross Sea party was hurried . Some who left Britain for Australia to join Aurora resigned before it departed for the Ross Sea , and a full complement of crew was in doubt until the last minute . Within the party only Mackintosh and Joyce had any previous Antarctic experience ; Mackintosh had lost an eye as the result of an accident during the Nimrod expedition and had gone home early .

 Endurance , without Shackleton ( who was detained in England by expedition business ) , left Plymouth on 8 August 1914 , heading first for Buenos Aires . Here Shackleton , who had travelled on a faster ship , rejoined the expedition . Hurley also came on board , together with Bakewell and the stowaway , Blackborow , while several others left the ship or were discharged . On 26 October the ship sailed for the South Atlantic , arriving in South Georgia on 5 November . Shackleton 's original intention was that the crossing would take place in the first season , 1914 – 15 . Although he soon recognised the impracticality of this , he neglected to inform Mackintosh and the Ross Sea party of his change of plan . According to the Daily Chronicle 's correspondent Ernest Perris , a cable intended for Macintosh was never sent . 
 After a month @-@ long halt in the Grytviken whaling station , Endurance departed for the Antarctic on 5 December . Two days later Shackleton was disconcerted to encounter pack ice as far north as 57 ° 26 ′ S , forcing the ship to manoeuvre . During the following days there were more tussles with the pack , which on 14 December was thick enough to halt the ship for 24 hours . Three days later the ship was stopped again . Shackleton commented : " I had been prepared for evil conditions in the Weddell Sea , but had hoped that the pack would be loose . What we were encountering was fairly dense pack of a very obstinate character " . 
 Endurance 's progress was frustratingly slow , until on 22 December leads opened up and the ship was able to continue steadily southward . This continued for the next two weeks , taking the party deep into the Weddell Sea . Further delays then slowed progress after the turn of the year , before a lengthy run south during 7 – 10 January 1915 brought them close to the 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) ice walls which guarded the Antarctic coastal region of Coats Land . This territory had been discovered and named by William Speirs Bruce in 1904 , during the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition . On 15 January Endurance came abreast of a great glacier , the edge of which formed a bay which appeared a good landing place . However , Shackleton considered it too far north of Vahsel Bay for a landing , " except under pressure of necessity " — a decision he would later regret . On 17 January the ship reached a latitude of 76 ° 27 ′ S , where land was faintly discernible . Shackleton named it Caird Coast , after his principal backer . Bad weather forced the ship to shelter in the lee of a stranded iceberg . 
 They were now close to Luitpold Land , discovered by Filchner in 1912 , at the southern end of which lay their destination , Vahsel Bay . Next day , the ship was forced north @-@ westward for 14 miles ( 23 km ) , resuming in a generally southerly direction before being stopped altogether . The position was 76 ° 34 ′ S , 31 ° 30 ′ W. After ten days of inactivity the ship ’ s fires were banked , to save fuel . Strenuous efforts were made to release her ; on 14 February Shackleton ordered men on to the ice with ice @-@ chisels , prickers , saws and picks , to try and force a passage , but the labour proved futile . Shackleton did not at this stage abandon all hope of breaking free , but was now contemplating the " possibility of having to spend a winter in the inhospitable arms of the pack " . 
 = = = = Drift of Endurance = = = = 
 On 21 February 1915 Endurance , still held fast , drifted to her most southerly latitude , 76 ° 58 ′ S. Thereafter she began moving with the pack in a northerly direction . On 24 February Shackleton realised that they would be held in the ice throughout the winter , and ordered ship ’ s routine abandoned . The dogs were taken off board and housed in ice @-@ kennels or " <unk> " , and the ship ’ s interior was converted to suitable winter quarters for the various groups of men — officers , scientists , engineers , and seamen . A wireless apparatus was rigged , but their location was too remote to receive or transmit signals . 
 Shackleton was aware of the recent example of Wilhelm Filchner 's ship , the Deutschland , which had become icebound in the same vicinity three years earlier . After Filchner 's attempts to establish a land base at Vahsel Bay failed , his ship Deutschland was trapped on 6 March 1912 , about 200 miles ( 320 km ) off the coast of Coats Land . Six months later , at latitude 63 ° 37 ’ , the ship broke free , then sailed to South Georgia apparently none the worse for its ordeal . Shackleton thought that a similar experience might allow Endurance to make a second attempt to reach Vahsel Bay in the following Antarctic spring . 
 In February and March the rate of drift was very slow . At the end of March Shackleton calculated that the ship had travelled a mere 95 miles ( 153 km ) since 19 January . However , as winter set in the speed of the drift increased , and the condition of the surrounding ice changed . On 14 April Shackleton recorded the nearby pack " piling and rafting against the masses of ice " — if the ship was caught in this disturbance " she would be crushed like an eggshell " . In May , as the sun set for the winter months , the ship was at 75 ° 23 ′ S , 42 ° 14 ′ W , still drifting northwards . It would be at least four months before spring brought the chance of an opening of the ice , and there was no certainty that Endurance would break free in time to attempt a return to the Vahsel Bay area . Shackleton now considered the possibility of finding an alternative landing ground on the western shores of the Weddell Sea , if that coast could be reached . " In the meantime " , he wrote , " we must wait " . 
 In the dark winter months of May , June and July , Shackleton was concerned to maintain fitness , training and morale . Although the scope for activity was limited , the dogs were exercised ( and on occasion raced competitively ) , men were encouraged to take moonlight walks , and aboard ship there were attempted theatricals . Special occasions such as Empire Day ( 24 May ) were duly celebrated . The first signs of the ice breaking up occurred on 22 July . On 1 August , in a south @-@ westerly gale with heavy snow , the ice floe began to disintegrate all around the ship , the pressure forcing masses of ice beneath the keel and causing a heavy list to port . The position was perilous ; Shackleton wrote : " The effects of the pressure around us was awe @-@ inspiring . Mighty blocks of ice [ ... ] rose slowly till they jumped like cherry @-@ stones gripped between thumb and finger [ ... ] if the ship was once gripped firmly her fate would be sealed " . This danger passed , and the succeeding weeks were quiet . During this relative lull the ship drifted into the area where , in 1823 , Captain Benjamin Morrell of the sealer Wasp reported seeing a coastline which he identified as " New South Greenland " . There was no sign of any such land ; Shackleton concluded that Morrell had been deceived by the presence of large icebergs . 
 On 30 September the ship sustained what Shackleton described as " the worst squeeze we had experienced " . Worsley described the pressure as like being " thrown to and fro like a <unk> a dozen times " . On 24 October , the starboard side was forced against a large floe , increasing the pressure until the hull began to bend and splinter , so that water from below the ice began to pour into the ship . When the timbers broke they made noises which sailors later described as being similar to the sound of " heavy fireworks and the blasting of guns " . The supplies and three lifeboats were transferred to the ice , while the crew attempted to shore up the boat 's hull and pump out the incoming sea , but after a few days , on 27 October 1915 , and in freezing temperatures below − 15 ° F ( − 25 ° C ) , Shackleton gave the order to abandon ship . The position at abandonment was 69 ° 05 ′ S , 51 ° 30 ′ W. The wreckage remained afloat , and over the following weeks the crew salvaged further supplies and materials , including Hurley 's photographs and cameras that had initially been left behind . From around 550 plates Hurley chose the best 150 , the maximum that could be carried , and smashed the rest . 
 = = = = Camping on the ice = = = = 
 With the loss of the ship the transcontinental plans were abandoned , and the focus shifted to that of survival . Shackleton 's intention now was to march the crew westward , to one or other of several possible destinations . His first thought was for Paulet Island , where he knew there was a hut containing a substantial food depot , because he had ordered it 12 years earlier while organising relief for Otto Nordenskiöld ’ s stranded Swedish expedition . Other possibilities were Snow Hill Island , which had been Nordenskiöld ’ s winter quarters and which was believed to contain a stock of emergency supplies , or Robertson Island . Shackleton believed that from one of these islands they would be able to reach and cross Graham Land , and get to the whaling outposts in Wilhelmina Bay . He calculated that on the day Endurance was abandoned they were 346 miles from Paulet Island . Worsley calculated the distance to Snow Hill Island to be 312 miles ( 500 km ) , with a further 120 miles ( 190 km ) to Wilhelmina Bay . He believed the march was too risky ; they should wait until the ice carried them to open water , and then escape in the boats . Shackleton overruled him . 
 Before the march could begin , Shackleton ordered the weakest animals to be shot , including the carpenter Harry McNish 's cat , Mrs. Chippy , and a pup which had become a pet of the surgeon Macklin . The company set out on 30 October 1915 , with two of the ship 's lifeboats carried on sledges . Problems quickly arose , as the condition of the sea ice around them worsened . According to Hurley the surface became " a labyrinth of hummocks and ridges " , in which barely a square yard was smooth . In three days the party managed to travel barely two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) , and on 1 November Shackleton abandoned the march ; they would make camp and await the break @-@ up of the ice . They gave the name " Ocean Camp " to the flat and solid @-@ looking floe on which their aborted march had ended , and settled down to wait . Parties continued to revisit the Endurance wreck , which was still drifting with the ice a short distance from the camp . More of the abandoned supplies were retrieved until , on 21 November 1915 , the ship finally slipped beneath the ice . 
 The ice was not drifting fast enough to be noticeable , although by late November the speed was up to seven miles a day . By 5 December they had passed 68 ° S , but the direction was turning slightly east of north . This was taking them to a position from which it would be difficult to reach Snow Hill Island , although Paulet Island , further north , remained a possibility . It was about 250 miles ( 400 km ) away , and Shackleton was anxious to reduce the length of the lifeboat journey that would be necessary to reach it . Therefore , on 21 December he announced a second march , to begin on 23 December . 
 Conditions , however , had not improved since the earlier attempt . Temperatures had risen and it was uncomfortably warm , with men sinking to their knees in soft snow as they struggled to haul the boats through the pressure ridges . On 27 December ship ’ s carpenter Harry McNish rebelled and refused to work . He argued that Ship ’ s Articles had lapsed since Endurance ’ s sinking , and that he was no longer under orders . Shackleton ’ s firm remonstrance finally brought the carpenter to heel , but the incident was never forgotten . Two days later , with only seven and a half miles ’ ( 12 km ) progress achieved in seven back @-@ breaking days , Shackleton called a halt , observing : " It would take us over three hundred days to reach the land " . The crew put up their tents and settled into what Shackleton called " Patience Camp " , which would be their home for more than three months . 
 Supplies were now running low . Hurley and Macklin were sent back to Ocean Camp to recover food that had been left there to lighten the sledging teams ’ burden . On 2 February 1916 Shackleton sent a larger party back , to recover the third lifeboat . Food shortages became acute as the weeks passed , and seal meat , which had added variety to their diet , now became a staple as Shackleton attempted to conserve the remaining packaged rations . In January , all but two teams of the dogs ( whose overall numbers had been depleted by mishaps and illness in the preceding months ) were shot on Shackleton ’ s orders , because the dogs ' requirements for seal meat were excessive . The final two teams were shot on 2 April , by which time their meat was a welcome addition to the rations . Meanwhile , the rate of drift became erratic ; after being held at around 67 ° for several weeks , at the end of January there was a series of rapid north @-@ eastward movements which , by 17 March , brought Patience Camp to the latitude of Paulet Island , but 60 miles ( 97 km ) to its east . " It might have been six hundred for all the chance we had of reaching it across the broken sea @-@ ice " , Shackleton recorded . 
 The party now had land more or less continuously in sight . The peak of Mount Haddington on James Ross Island remained in view as the party drifted slowly by . They were too far north for Snow Hill or Paulet Island to be accessible , and Shackleton 's chief hopes were now fixed on two remaining small islands at the northern extremity of Graham Land . These were Clarence Island and Elephant Island , around 100 miles ( 160 km ) due north of their position on 25 March . He then decided that Deception Island might be a better target destination . This lay far to the west , towards the South Shetland Islands chain , but Shackleton thought it might be attainable by island @-@ hopping . Its advantage was that it was sometimes visited by whalers , and might contain provisions , whereas Clarence Island and Elephant Island were desolate and unvisited . To reach any of these destinations would require a perilous journey in the lifeboats , once the floe upon which they were drifting finally broke up . Earlier , the lifeboats had been named after the expedition ’ s three chief financial sponsors : James Caird , Dudley Docker and Stancomb Wills .

 The end of Patience Camp was signalled on the evening of 8 April , when the floe suddenly split . The camp now found itself on a small triangular raft of ice ; a break @-@ up of this would mean disaster , so Shackleton readied the lifeboats for the party ’ s enforced departure . He had now decided they would try , if possible , to reach the distant Deception Island because a small wooden church had been reportedly erected for the benefit of whalers . This could provide a source of timber that might enable them to construct a seaworthy boat . At 1 pm on 9 April the Dudley Docker was launched , and an hour later all three boats were away . Shackleton himself commanded the James Caird , Worsley the Dudley Docker , and navigating officer Hubert Hudson was nominally in charge of the Stancomb Wills , though because of his precarious mental state the effective commander was Tom Crean . 
 The boats were surrounded by ice , dependent upon leads of water opening up , and progress was perilous and erratic . Frequently the boats were tied to floes , or dragged up on to them , while the men camped and waited for conditions to improve . Shackleton was wavering again between several potential destinations , and on 12 April rejected the various island options and decided on Hope Bay , at the very tip of Graham Land . However , conditions in the boats , in temperatures sometimes as low as − 20 ° F ( − 30 ° C ) , with little food and regular <unk> in icy seawater , were wearing the men down , physically and mentally . Shackleton therefore decided that Elephant Island , the nearest of the possible refuges , was now the most practical option . 
 On 14 April the boats lay off the south @-@ east coast of Elephant Island , but could not land as the shore consisted of perpendicular cliffs and glaciers . Next day the James Caird rounded the eastern point of the island , to reach the northern lee shore , and discovered a narrow shingle beach . Soon afterwards , the three boats , which had been separated during the previous night , were reunited at this landing place . It was apparent from high tide markings that this beach would not serve as a long @-@ term camp , so the next day Wild and a crew set off in the Stancomb Wills to explore the coast for a safer site . They returned with news of a long spit of land , seven miles ( 11 km ) to the west . With minimum delay the men returned to the boats and transferred to this new location , which they later christened Cape Wild . 
 = = = = Voyage of the James Caird = = = = 
 Elephant Island was remote , uninhabited , and rarely visited by whalers or any other ships . If the party was to return to civilization it would be necessary to summon help . The only realistic way this could be done was to adapt one of the lifeboats for an 800 @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 300 km ) voyage across the Southern Ocean , to South Georgia . Shackleton had abandoned thoughts of taking the party on the less dangerous journey to Deception Island , because of the poor physical condition of many of his party . Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands was closer than South Georgia , but could not be reached , as this would require sailing against the strong prevailing winds . 
 Shackleton selected the boat party : himself , Worsley as navigator , Crean , McNish , John Vincent and Timothy McCarthy . On instructions from Shackleton , McNish immediately set about adapting the James Caird , improvising tools and materials . Frank Wild was to be left in charge of the Elephant Island party , with instructions to make for Deception Island the following spring , should Shackleton not return . Shackleton took supplies for only four weeks , knowing that if land had not been reached within that time the boat would be lost . 
 The 22 @.@ 5 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 85 m ) James Caird was launched on 24 April 1916 . The success of the voyage depended on the pin @-@ point accuracy of Worsley 's navigation , using observations that would have to be made in the most unfavourable of conditions . The prevailing wind was helpfully north @-@ west , but the heavy sea conditions quickly soaked everything in icy water . Soon ice settled thickly on the boat , making her ride sluggishly . On 5 May a north @-@ westerly gale almost caused the boat 's destruction as it faced what Shackleton described as the largest waves he had seen in twenty @-@ six years at sea . On 8 May South Georgia was sighted , after a 14 @-@ day battle with the elements that had driven the boat party to their physical limits . Two days later , after a prolonged struggle with heavy seas and hurricane @-@ force winds to the south of the island , the party struggled ashore at King Haakon Bay . 
 = = = = South Georgia crossing = = = = 
 The arrival of the James Caird at King Haakon Bay was followed by a period of rest and recuperation , while Shackleton pondered the next move . The populated whaling stations of South Georgia lay on the northern coast . To reach them would mean either another boat journey around the island , or a land crossing through its unexplored interior . The condition of the James Caird , and the physical state of the party , particularly Vincent and McNish , meant that the crossing was the only realistic option . 
 After five days the party took the boat a short distance eastwards , to the head of a deep bay which would be the starting point for the crossing . Shackleton , Worsley and Crean would undertake the land journey , the others remaining at what they christened " Peggotty Camp " , to be picked up later after help had been obtained from the whaling stations . A storm on 18 May delayed their start , but by two o 'clock the following morning the weather was clear and calm , and an hour later the crossing party set out . 
 Without a map , the route they chose was largely conjectural . By dawn they had ascended to 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) and could see the northern coast . They were above Possession Bay , which meant they would need to move eastward to reach their intended destination of Stromness . This meant the first of several <unk> that would extend the journey and frustrate the men . At the close of that first day , needing to descend to the valley below them before nightfall , they risked everything by sliding down a mountainside on a makeshift rope sledge . There was no question of rest — they travelled on by moonlight , moving upwards towards a gap in the next mountainous ridge . Early next morning , 20 May , seeing Husvik Harbour below them , they knew that they were on the right path . At seven o 'clock in the morning they heard the steam whistle sound from Stromness , " the first sound created by an outside human agency that had come to our ears since we left Stromness Bay in December 1914 " . After a difficult descent , which involved passage down through a freezing waterfall , they at last reached safety . 
 Shackleton wrote afterwards : " I have no doubt that Providence guided us ... I know that during that long and racking march of thirty @-@ six hours over the unnamed mountains and glaciers it seemed to me often that we were four , not three " . This image of a fourth traveller — echoed in the accounts of Worsley and Crean — was taken up by T. S. Eliot in his poem The Waste Land . 
 = = = = Rescue = = = = 
 Shackleton 's first task , on arriving at the Stromness station , was to arrange for his three companions at <unk> Camp to be picked up . A whaler was sent round the coast , with Worsley aboard to show the way , and by the evening of 21 May all six of the James Caird party were safe . 
 It took four attempts before Shackleton was able to return to Elephant Island to rescue the party stranded there . He first left South Georgia a mere three days after he had arrived in Stromness , after securing the use of a large whaler , The Southern Sky , which was laid up in Husvik Harbour . Shackleton assembled a volunteer crew , which had it ready to sail by the morning of 22 May . As the vessel approached Elephant Island they saw that an impenetrable barrier of pack ice had formed , some 70 miles ( 110 km ) from their destination . The Southern Sky was not built for ice breaking , and retreated to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands . 
 On reaching Port Stanley , Shackleton informed London by cable of his whereabouts , and requested that a suitable vessel be sent south for the rescue operation . He was informed by the Admiralty that nothing was available before October , which in his view was too late . Then , with the help of the British Minister in Montevideo , Shackleton obtained from the Uruguayan government the loan of a tough trawler , Instituto de Pesca No. 1 , which started south on 10 June . Again the pack thwarted them . In search of another ship , Shackleton , Worsley and Crean travelled to Punta Arenas , in Chile , where they met Allan MacDonald , the British owner of the schooner Emma . McDonald equipped this vessel for a further rescue attempt , which left on 12 July , but with the same negative result — the pack defeated them yet again . Shackleton later named a glacier after McDonald on the Brunt Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea . After problems arose in identifying this glacier , a nearby ice rise was renamed the McDonald Ice <unk> . 
 By now it was mid @-@ August , more than three months since Shackleton had left Elephant Island . Shackleton begged the Chilean Government to lend him Yelcho , a small steam tug that had assisted Emma during the previous attempt . The Government agreed , and on 25 August Yelcho , captained by Luis Pardo , set out for Elephant Island . This time , as Shackleton records , providence favoured them . The seas were open , and the ship was able to approach close to the island , in thick fog . At 11 : 40 am on 30 August the fog lifted , the camp was spotted and , within an hour , all the Elephant Island party were safely aboard , bound for Punta Arenas . 
 = = = = On Elephant Island = = = = 
 After Shackleton left with the James Caird , Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party , some of whom were in a low state , physically or mentally : Lewis <unk> had suffered a suspected heart attack ; Blackborow was unable to walk , due to frostbitten feet ; Hudson was mentally depressed . The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter . On the suggestion of Marston and Lionel Greenstreet , a hut ( nicknamed the " <unk> " ) was improvised by <unk> the two boats and placing them on low stone walls , to provide around five feet of headroom . By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter . 
 Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue , and refused to allow long @-@ term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this , in his view , was defeatist . This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde @-@ Lees . Orde @-@ Lees was not a popular man , and his presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions , unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes . 
 As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast , Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium . A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship , cooking and housekeeping <unk> were established , and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin . Concerts were held on Saturdays , and anniversaries celebrated , but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship . The toes on Blackborow 's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite , and on 15 June had to be amputated by the surgeons Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle @-@ lit hut . Using the very last of the chloroform that had survived in the medical supplies , the whole procedure took 55 minutes , and was a complete success . 
 By 23 August , it seemed that Wild ’ s no @-@ stockpiling policy had failed . The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship , food supplies were running out and no penguins were coming ashore . Orde @-@ Lees wrote : " We shall have to eat the one who dies first [ ... ] there ’ s many a true word said in jest " . Wild ’ s thoughts were now turning seriously to the possibility of a boat trip to Deception Island — he planned to set out on 5 October , in the hoping of meeting a whaling ship — when , on 30 August 1916 , the ordeal ended suddenly with the appearance of Shackleton and Yelcho . 
 = = = Ross Sea Party = = = 
 Aurora left Hobart on 24 December 1914 , having been delayed in Australia by financial and organizational problems . The arrival in McMurdo Sound on 15 January 1915 was later in the season than planned , but the party ’ s commander Aeneas Mackintosh made immediate plans for a depot @-@ laying journey on the Ross Ice Shelf , since he understood that Shackleton hoped to attempt the crossing during that first season . Neither the men nor the dogs were acclimatised , and the party was , as a whole , very inexperienced in ice conditions . The first journey on the ice resulted in the loss of ten of the party ’ s 18 dogs and a frostbitten and generally demoralised shore party ; a single , incomplete depot was their only achievement . 
 On 7 May Aurora , anchored at the party 's Cape Evans headquarters , was wrenched from her moorings during a gale and carried with drifting ice far out to sea . <unk> to return to McMurdo Sound , she remained captive in the ice for nine months until on 12 February 1916 , having travelled a distance of around 1 @,@ 600 miles ( 2 @,@ 600 km ) , she reached open water and limped to New Zealand . She carried with her the greater part of the shore party ’ s fuel , food rations , clothing and equipment , although the sledging rations for the depots had been landed ashore . To continue with its mission the stranded shore party had to re @-@ supply and re @-@ equip itself from the leftovers from earlier expeditions , notably Captain Scott ’ s Terra Nova Expedition which had been based at Cape Evans a few years earlier . They were thus able to begin the second season ’ s depot @-@ laying on schedule , in September 1915 . 
 In the following months the required depots were laid , at one @-@ degree intervals across the Ross Ice Shelf to the foot of the Beardmore Glacier . On the return journey from the glacier the party was attacked by scurvy ; Arnold Spencer @-@ Smith , the expedition ’ s chaplain and photographer , collapsed and died on the ice . The remainder of the party reached the temporary shelter of Hut Point , a relic of the Discovery Expedition at the southern end of McMurdo Sound , where they slowly recovered . On 8 May 1916 Mackintosh and Victor Hayward decided to walk across the unstable sea ice to Cape Evans , were caught in a blizzard , and were not seen again . The survivors eventually reached Cape Evans , but then had to wait for eight further months . Finally , on 10 January 1917 the repaired and refitted Aurora , whose departure from New Zealand had been delayed by lack of money , arrived to transport them back to civilization ; . Shackleton accompanied the ship as a supernumerary officer , having been denied command by the governments of New Zealand , Australia and Great Britain who had jointly organised and financed the Ross Sea party 's relief . 
 = = Return to civilization , and aftermath = = 
 The rescued party , having had its last contact with civilization in 1914 , was unaware of the course of the World War . News of Shackleton 's safe arrival in the Falklands briefly eclipsed war news in the British newspapers on 2 June 1916 . The expedition returned home in piecemeal fashion , at a critical stage in the war , without the normal honours and civic receptions . When Shackleton himself finally arrived in England on 29 May 1917 , after a short American lecture tour , his return was barely noticed . 
 Despite McNish 's efforts on the in preparing and sailing on James Caird voyage , his prior insubordination meant that , on Shackleton ’ s recommendation , he was one of four men denied the Polar Medal ; the others whose contributions fell short of Shackleton 's expected standards were John Vincent , William Stephenson and Ernest Holness . Most of the members of the expedition returned to take up immediate active military or naval service . Before the war ended two — Tim McCarthy of the open boat journey and the veteran Antarctic sailor Alfred Cheetham — had been killed in action , and Ernest Wild of the Ross Sea party had died of typhoid while serving in the Mediterranean . Several others were severely wounded , and many received decorations for gallantry . Following a propaganda mission in Buenos Aires , Shackleton was employed during the last weeks of the war on special service in Murmansk , with the Army rank of Major . This occupied him until March 1919 . He thereafter organised one final Antarctic expedition , the Shackleton – Rowett Expedition on Quest , which left London on 17 September 1921 . From the Endurance crew , Wild , Worsley , Macklin , McIlroy , Hussey , Alexander Kerr , Thomas McLeod and cook Charles Green , all sailed with Quest . 
 Shackleton died of a heart attack on 5 January 1922 , while Quest was anchored at South Georgia . After his death the original programme , which had included an exploration of Enderby Land , was abandoned . Wild led a brief cruise which brought them into sight of Elephant Island . They anchored off Cape Wild , and were able to see the old landmarks , but sea conditions made it impossible for them to land . 
 It would be more than 40 years before the first crossing of Antarctica was achieved , by the Commonwealth Trans @-@ Antarctic Expedition , 1955 – 58 . This expedition set out from Vahsel Bay , following a route which avoided the Beardmore Glacier altogether , and bypassed much of the Ross Ice Shelf , reaching McMurdo Sound via a descent of the Skelton Glacier . The entire journey took 98 days . 
 Films and documentaries about the Imperial Trans @-@ Antarctic Expedition include the 2002 two @-@ part television drama Shackleton , written and directed by Charles Sturridge , with Kenneth Branagh as Shackleton . In preparation for his role , Branagh spent six weeks in the Antarctic . In 2013 PBS screened a three @-@ part documentary that recreates the James Caird voyage using a replica lifeboat and original materials .

 <unk> <unk> " Tiger " Woods ( born December 30 , 1975 ) is an American professional golfer who is among the most successful golfers of all time . He has been one of the highest @-@ paid athletes in the world for several years . 
 Following an outstanding amateur and two @-@ year college golf career , Woods turned professional at age 20 in late summer 1996 . By April 1997 he had already won his first major , the 1997 Masters , in a record @-@ breaking performance , winning the tournament by 12 strokes and pocketing $ 486 @,@ 000 . He first reached the number one position in the world rankings in June 1997 . Through the 2000s , Woods was the dominant force in golf , spending 264 weeks from August 1999 to September 2004 and 281 weeks from June 2005 to October 2010 as World Number One . 
 From December 2009 to early April 2010 , Woods took leave from professional golf to focus on his marriage after he admitted infidelity , but he and his wife Elin Nordegren eventually divorced . His many extramarital indiscretions were revealed by several different women , through many worldwide media sources . This was followed by a loss of golf form , and his ranking gradually fell to a low of No. 58 in November 2011 . He ended a career @-@ high winless streak of 107 weeks when he captured the Chevron World Challenge in December 2011 . After winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational on March 25 , 2013 , he ascended to the No.1 ranking once again , holding the top spot until May 2014 . Woods had back surgery ( microdiscectomy ) in April 2014 and September 2015 and has struggled since to regain his dominant form . By March 29 , 2015 , Woods had fallen to # 104 , outside of the top 100 for the first time since the week prior to his first Tour title win in 1996 . In May 2016 , Woods dropped out of the world top 500 for the first time in his professional career . 
 Woods has broken numerous golf records . He has been World Number One for the most consecutive weeks and for the greatest total number of weeks of any golfer . He has been awarded PGA Player of the Year a record eleven times , the Byron Nelson Award for lowest adjusted scoring average a record eight times , and has the record of leading the money list in ten different seasons . He has won 14 professional major golf championships , the second @-@ highest of any player ( Jack Nicklaus leads with 18 ) , and 79 PGA Tour events , second all time behind Sam Snead , who had 82 wins . He has more career major wins and career PGA Tour wins than any other active golfer . He is the youngest player to achieve the career Grand Slam , and the youngest and fastest to win 50 tournaments on tour . Additionally , Woods is only the second golfer , after Nicklaus , to have achieved a career Grand Slam three times . Woods has won 18 World Golf Championships , and won at least one of those events in each of the first 11 years after they began in 1999 . Woods and Rory McIlroy are the only golfers to win both The Silver Medal and The Gold Medal at The Open Championship . 
 = = Background and family = = 
 Woods was born in Cypress , California , to Earl ( 1932 – 2006 ) and Kultida ( <unk> ) Woods ( born 1944 ) . He is the only child of their marriage ; however , he does have two half @-@ brothers , Earl Jr . ( born 1955 ) and Kevin ( born 1957 ) , and a half @-@ sister , Royce ( born 1958 ) from the 18 @-@ year marriage of Earl Woods and his first wife , Barbara Woods Gray . 
 Kultida ( née <unk> ) , originally from Thailand ( where Earl had met her on a tour of duty in 1968 ) , is of mixed Thai , Chinese , and Dutch ancestry , making her an Asian American . Earl , a retired lieutenant colonel and Vietnam War veteran , was of mostly African American and traces of European descent . Earl 's grandmother was " the prettiest blonde you ever saw " and Earl 's mother Maude Carter was of light skin . Some suggest possible Native American and Chinese ancestry . Tiger refers to his ethnic make @-@ up as " <unk> " ( a syllabic abbreviation he coined from Caucasian , Black , American Indian , and Asian ) . 
 Woods ' first name , <unk> , was coined by his mother because it began with " E " ( for Earl ) and ended with " K " ( for Kultida ) . His middle name <unk> is a traditional Thai name . He was nicknamed Tiger in honor of his father 's friend Col. Vuong Dang Phong , who had also been known as Tiger . 
 Woods has a niece , Cheyenne Woods , who played for Wake Forest University 's golf team and turned professional in 2012 , making her pro debut in the LPGA Championship . 
 = = Early life and amateur golf career = = 
 Woods grew up in Orange County , California . He was a child prodigy , introduced to golf before the age of two , by his athletic father Earl , a single @-@ figure handicap amateur golfer who had been one of the earliest African @-@ American college baseball players at Kansas State University . In 1978 , Tiger <unk> against comedian Bob Hope in a television appearance on The Mike Douglas Show . At age three , he shot a 48 over nine holes over the Cypress Navy course , and at age five , he appeared in Golf Digest and on ABC 's That 's Incredible . Before turning seven , Tiger won the Under Age 10 section of the Drive , Pitch , and Putt competition , held at the Navy Golf Course in Cypress , California . In 1984 at the age of eight , he won the 9 – 10 boys ' event , the youngest age group available , at the Junior World Golf Championships . He first broke 80 at age eight . He went on to win the Junior World Championships six times , including four consecutive wins from 1988 to 1991 . 
 Woods ' father Earl wrote that Tiger first defeated him at the age of 11 years , with Earl trying his best . Earl lost to Tiger every time from then on . Woods first broke 70 on a regulation golf course at age 12 . 
 Woods ' first major national junior tournament was the 1989 Big I , when he was 13 years old . Woods was paired with pro John Daly , then relatively unknown , in the final round ; the event 's format placed a professional with each group of juniors who had qualified . Daly <unk> three of the last four holes to beat Woods by only one stroke . As a young teenager , Woods first met Jack Nicklaus in Los Angeles at the Bel @-@ Air Country Club , when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club 's members . Woods was part of the show , and impressed Nicklaus and the crowd with his skills and potential . Earl Woods had researched in detail the career accomplishments of Nicklaus , and had set his young son the goals of breaking those records . 
 While attending Western High School in Anaheim at the age of 15 , Woods became the youngest @-@ ever U.S. Junior Amateur champion ( a record which stood until it was broken by Jim Liu in 2010 ) . He was named 1991 's Southern California Amateur Player of the Year ( for the second consecutive year ) and Golf Digest Junior Amateur Player of the Year . In 1992 , he defended his title at the U.S. Junior Amateur Championship , becoming the first multiple winner ; competed in his first PGA Tour event , the Nissan Los Angeles Open ( he missed the 36 @-@ hole cut ) ; and was named Golf Digest Amateur Player of the Year , Golf World Player of the Year , and <unk> National Amateur of the Year . 
 The following year , Woods won his third consecutive U.S. Junior Amateur Championship ; he remains the event 's only three @-@ time winner . In 1994 , at the TPC at Sawgrass in Florida , he became the youngest @-@ ever winner of the U.S. Amateur Championship , a record he held until 2008 when it was broken by Danny Lee . He was a member of the American team at the 1994 Eisenhower Trophy World Amateur Golf Team Championships ( winning ) , and the 1995 Walker Cup ( losing ) . 
 Woods graduated from Western High School in 1994 at age 18 , and was voted " Most Likely to Succeed " among the graduating class . He had starred for the high school 's golf team under coach Don Crosby . 
 Woods overcame difficulties with stuttering as a boy . This was not known until he wrote a letter to a boy who contemplated suicide . Woods wrote , " I know what it 's like to be different and to sometimes not fit in . I also stuttered as a child and I would talk to my dog and he would sit there and listen until he fell asleep . I also took a class for two years to help me , and I finally learned to stop . " 
 = = College golf career = = 
 Woods was recruited very heavily by college golf powers , and chose Stanford University , the 1994 NCAA Division I champions . He enrolled at Stanford in the fall of 1994 under a golf scholarship , winning his first collegiate event , the 40th Annual William H. Tucker Invitational , that September . He selected a major in economics , and was nicknamed " Urkel " by college teammate <unk> <unk> III . In 1995 , he successfully defended his U.S. Amateur title at the Newport Country Club in Rhode Island and was voted Pac @-@ 10 Player of the Year , NCAA First Team All @-@ American , and Stanford 's Male Freshman of the Year ( an award that encompasses all sports ) . 
 At age 19 , Woods participated in his first PGA Tour major , the 1995 Masters Tournament , and tied for 41st as the only amateur to make the cut . At age 20 in 1996 , he became the first golfer to win three consecutive U.S. Amateur titles and won the NCAA individual golf championship . In winning the Silver Medal as leading amateur at The Open Championship , he tied the record for an amateur aggregate score of 281 . He left college after two years and turned professional . In 1996 , Woods moved out of California , stating in 2013 that it was due to the state 's tax rate . 
 = = Professional career = = 
 Woods became a professional golfer in August 1996 , and immediately signed deals with Nike , Inc. and Titleist that ranked as the most lucrative endorsement contracts in golf history at that time . Woods was named Sports Illustrated 's 1996 Sportsman of the Year and PGA Tour Rookie of the Year . In April 1997 , he won his first major , the Masters , becoming the tournament 's youngest @-@ ever winner . Two months later , he set the record for the fastest @-@ ever ascent to No. 1 in the Official World Golf Rankings . After a lackluster 1998 , Woods finished the 1999 season with eight wins , including the PGA Championship , a feat not achieved since 1974 . 
 In 2000 , Woods achieved six consecutive wins , the longest winning streak since Ben Hogan did it in 1948 . One of these was the 2000 U.S. Open , where he broke or tied nine tournament records in what Sports Illustrated called " the greatest performance in golf history , " in which Woods won the tournament by a 15 @-@ stroke margin and earned a check for $ 800 @,@ 000 . At age 24 , he became the youngest golfer to achieve the Career Grand Slam . At the end of 2000 , Woods had won nine of the twenty PGA Tour events he entered and had broken the record for lowest scoring average in tour history . He was named the Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year , the only athlete to be honored twice , and was ranked by Golf Digest magazine as the twelfth @-@ best golfer of all time . 
 Woods ' victory in the 2001 Masters Tournament made him the first player to hold all four major professional golf titles at the same time , although not in the same calendar year . Following a stellar 2001 and 2002 in which Woods continued to dominate the tour , Woods ' career hit a " slump " . He did not win a major in 2003 or 2004 . In September 2004 , Vijay Singh overtook Woods in the Official World Golf Rankings , ending Woods ' record streak of 264 weeks at # 1 . 
 Woods rebounded in 2005 , winning six official PGA Tour money events and reclaiming the top spot in July after swapping it back and forth with Singh over the first half of the year . 
 In 2006 , Woods began dominantly , winning his first two PGA tournaments but failing to capture his fifth Masters championship in April . Following the death of his father in May , Woods took a nine @-@ week hiatus from the tour and appeared rusty upon his return at the U.S. Open , missing the cut at Winged Foot . However , he quickly returned to form and ended the year by winning six consecutive tour events . At the season 's close , with 54 wins and 12 majors wins , Woods had broken the tour records for both total wins and total majors wins over eleven seasons . 
 Woods continued to excel in 2007 and the first part of 2008 . In April 2008 , he underwent knee surgery and missed the next two months on the tour . Woods returned for the 2008 U.S. Open , where he struggled the first day but ultimately claimed a dramatic victory over Rocco Mediate , after which Mediate said , " This guy does things that are just not normal by any stretch of the imagination , " and Kenny Perry added , " He beat everybody on one leg . " Two days later , Woods announced that he would miss the remainder of the season due to further knee surgery , and that his knee was more severely damaged than previously revealed , prompting even greater praise for his U.S. Open performance . Woods called it " my greatest ever championship . " In Woods ' absence , TV ratings for the remainder of the season suffered a huge decline from 2007 . 
 Upon Woods ' much @-@ anticipated return in 2009 , he performed well , including a spectacular performance at the 2009 Presidents Cup , but failed to win a major , the first year since 2004 that he had not done so . After his marital infidelities came to light and received massive media coverage at the end of 2009 ( see further details below ) , Woods announced in December that he would be taking an indefinite break from competitive golf . In February 2010 , he delivered a televised apology for his behavior . During this period , several companies ended their endorsement deals with Woods . 
 Woods returned to competition in April at the 2010 Masters Tournament , where he finished in a tie for fourth place . He followed the Masters with poor showings at the Quail Hollow Championship and the Players Championship , where he withdrew in the fourth round citing injury . Shortly afterward , Hank Haney , Woods ' coach since 2003 , resigned the position ; he was replaced in August by Sean Foley . The rest of the season went badly for Woods , who failed to win a single event for the first time since turning professional , while nevertheless finishing the season ranked No. 2 in the world . 
 Woods ' performance continued to suffer in 2011 , taking its toll on his ranking . After falling to No. 7 in March , he rebounded to No. 5 with a strong showing at the 2011 Masters Tournament , where he tied for fourth place . Due to leg injuries incurred at the Masters , he missed several summer events ; in July he fired his longtime caddy Steve Williams , replacing him temporarily with friend Bryon Bell . After returning to tournament play in August , Woods continued to falter , and his ranking gradually fell to a low of # 58 . He rose to No. 50 in mid @-@ November after a third @-@ place finish at the Emirates Australian Open , and broke his winless streak with a victory at December 's Chevron World Challenge . 
 Woods began his 2012 season with two tournaments ( the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship and the AT & T Pebble Beach National Pro @-@ Am ) where he started off well , but struggled on the final rounds . Following the WGC @-@ Accenture Match Play Championship , where he was knocked out in the second round by missing a 5 @-@ foot putt , Woods revised his putting technique and tied for second at the Honda Classic , with the lowest final round score in his PGA Tour career . After a short time off due to another leg injury , Woods won the Arnold Palmer Invitational , his first win on the PGA Tour since the BMW Championship in September 2009 . Following several dismal performances , Woods notched his 73rd PGA Tour win at the Memorial Tournament in June , tying Jack Nicklaus in second place for most PGA Tour victories ; a month later , Woods surpassed Nicklaus with a win at the AT & T National , to trail only Sam Snead , who had 82 PGA wins . 
 2013 would bring a return of Woods ' dominating play . He won the Farmers Insurance Open in January 2013 by four shots for his 75th PGA Tour win . It was the seventh time he had won the event . In March , he won the WGC @-@ Cadillac Championship , also for the seventh time , giving him his 17th WGC title and first since 2009 . Two weeks later , he won the Arnold Palmer Invitational , winning the event for a record @-@ tying 8th time . The win moved him back to the top of the world rankings . To commemorate that achievement , Nike was quick to launch an ad with the tagline " winning takes care of everything " . 
 On April 13 , 2013 , Woods was up for disqualification from the 2013 Masters Tournament over claims he took an illegal drop after his third shot on the par @-@ 5 15th hole bounced off of the pin and into the water . After further review , Woods was assessed a two @-@ stroke penalty for the drop and not disqualified . He finished T4 in the event . Woods won The Players Championship in May 2013 , his second career win at the event , notching his fourth win of the 2013 season . It was the quickest he had ever gotten to four wins in any season in his professional career . 
 Woods had a poor showing at the 2013 U.S Open as a result of an elbow injury sustained at The Players Championship . In finishing at + 13 , he recorded his worst score ever as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner Justin Rose . After a prolonged break because of the injury , during which he missed the Greenbrier Classic and his own AT & T National , he returned at the Open Championship at Muirfield . Despite being in contention all week and beginning the final round only two stokes behind Lee Westwood , he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3 @-@ over @-@ par 74 which left him tied for 6th place , five strokes behind eventual winner Phil Mickelson . Two weeks later , Woods returned to form at the WGC @-@ Bridgestone Invitational , recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15 @-@ year history . His second round 61 matched his record score on the PGA Tour and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes . This gave him a seven stroke lead which he held on to for the rest of the tournament . Woods would never contend at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club and would come short of winning a major for the 5th full season , only contending in two of the four majors in 2013 . 
 After a slow start to 2014 , Woods injured himself during the Honda Classic and was unable to finish , withdrawing after 13 holes of the final round citing back pain . He subsequently competed in the WGC @-@ Cadillac Championship but was visibly in pain during much of the last round . He was forced to skip the Arnold Palmer Invitational at the end of March 2014 and , on April 1 , announced that he would miss the Masters Tournament for the first time since 1994 after undergoing a microdiscectomy . Woods returned at the Quicken Loans National in June , however he stated that his expectations for the week were low . He would struggle with nearly every aspect of his game and miss the cut . He next played at The Open Championship , contested at Hoylake , where Woods had won eight years prior . Woods fired a brilliant 69 in the first round to put himself in contention , but shot 77 on Friday and would eventually finish 69th . Despite his back pain , he played at the 2014 PGA Championship where he failed to make the cut . On August 25 , 2014 , Woods and his swing coach Sean Foley parted ways . In the four years under Foley , he won eight times but no majors . He had previously won eight majors with Harmon and six with Haney . Woods said there is currently no timetable to find a replacement swing coach . 
 On February 5 , 2015 , Woods withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open after another back injury . Woods stated on his website that it was unrelated to his previous surgery and was taking a break from golf until his back healed . He returned for the 2015 Masters Tournament , finishing in a tie for 17th . In the final round , Woods injured his wrist after his club hit a tree root . He later stated that a bone popped out of his wrist , but he adjusted it back into place and finished the round . Woods then missed the cut at the 2015 U.S. Open and Open Championship , the first time ever Woods missed the cut at consecutive majors , finishing near the bottom of the leaderboard both times . He finished tied for 18th at the Quicken Loans National on August 2 . In late August 2015 , Woods played quite well at the Wyndham Championship finishing the tournament at 13 @-@ under , only four strokes behind the winner , and tied for 10th place . Woods offered only a brief comment on the speculation that he was still recovering from back surgery , saying it was " just my hip " but offering no specifics . 
 In late March 2016 , Woods announced that he would miss the Masters Tournament while recovering from a back surgery ( microdiscectomy ) that took place on September 16 , 2015 . ( He had also missed the 2014 Masters due to a back problem . ) " I 'm absolutely making progress , and I 'm really happy with how far I 've come , " he explained in a statement . " But I still have no timetable to return to competitive golf . " However , he did attend the Masters Champions Dinner on April 5 , 2016 .

 On August 20 , 2007 , California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver announced that Woods would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame . He was inducted December 5 , 2007 at The California Museum for History , Women and the Arts in Sacramento . 
 He has been named " Athlete of the Decade " by the Associated Press in December 2009 . He has been named Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year a record @-@ tying four times , and is the only person to be named Sports Illustrated 's Sportsman of the Year more than once . 
 Since his record @-@ breaking win at the 1997 Masters Tournament , golf 's increased popularity is commonly attributed to Woods ' presence . He is credited by some sources for dramatically increasing prize money in golf , generating interest in new PGA tournament audiences , and for drawing the largest TV ratings in golf history . 
 = = = Endorsements = = = 
 During the first decade of his professional career , Woods was the world 's most marketable athlete . Shortly after his 21st birthday in 1996 , he began signing endorsement deals with numerous companies , including General Motors , Titleist , General Mills , American Express , Accenture , and Nike , Inc . In 2000 , he signed a 5 @-@ year , $ 105 million contract extension with Nike . It was the largest endorsing deal ever signed by an athlete at that time . Woods ' endorsement has been credited with playing a significant role in taking the Nike Golf brand from a " start @-@ up " golf company earlier in the past decade , to becoming the leading golf apparel company in the world , and a major player in the equipment and golf ball market . Nike Golf is one of the fastest growing brands in the sport , with an estimated $ 600 million in sales . Woods has been described as the " ultimate endorser " for Nike Golf , frequently seen wearing Nike gear during tournaments , and even in advertisements for other products . Woods receives a percentage from the sales of Nike Golf apparel , footwear , golf equipment , golf balls , and has a building named after him at Nike 's headquarters campus in Beaverton , Oregon . 
 In 2002 , Woods was involved in every aspect of the launch of Buick 's Rendezvous SUV . A company spokesman stated that Buick was happy with the value of Woods ' endorsement , pointing out that more than 130 @,@ 000 Rendezvous vehicles were sold in 2002 and 2003 . " That exceeded our forecasts , " he was quoted as saying , " It has to be in recognition of Tiger . " In February 2004 , Buick renewed Woods ' endorsement contract for another five years , in a deal reportedly worth $ 40 million . 
 Woods collaborated closely with TAG Heuer to develop the world 's first professional golf watch , released in April 2005 . The lightweight , titanium @-@ construction watch , designed to be worn while playing the game , incorporates numerous innovative design features to accommodate golf play . It is capable of absorbing up to 5 @,@ 000 Gs of shock , far in excess of the forces generated by a normal golf swing . In 2006 , the TAG Heuer Professional Golf Watch won the prestigious iF product design award in the Leisure / Lifestyle category . 
 Woods also endorses the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series of video games ; he has done so since 1999 . In 2006 , he signed a six @-@ year contract with Electronic Arts , the series ' publisher . 
 In February 2007 , along with Roger Federer and Thierry Henry , Woods became an ambassador for the " Gillette Champions " marketing campaign . Gillette did not disclose financial terms , though an expert estimated the deal could total between $ 10 million and $ 20 million . 
 In October 2007 , Gatorade announced that Woods would have his own brand of sports drink starting in March 2008 . " Gatorade Tiger " was his first U.S. deal with a beverage company and his first licensing agreement . Although no figures were officially disclosed , <unk> magazine reported that it was for five years and could pay him as much as $ 100 million . The company decided in early fall 2009 to discontinue the drink due to weak sales . 
 In July 2011 , Woods appeared on a 15 @-@ second Japanese television commercial , endorsing a heat back rub by <unk> Co . , the <unk> <unk> rub . Details of the deal , which was made in late 2010 , were not disclosed . 
 In October 2012 , it was announced that Woods had signed an exclusive endorsement deal with Fuse Science , Inc , a sports nutrition firm . 
 A case was initiated against Bruce Matthews ( the owner of Gotta Have It Golf , Inc . ) and others in 1997 by Woods and fellow golfer Arnold Palmer in the effort to stop the unauthorized sale of their images and alleged signatures in the memorabilia market . Matthews and associated parties <unk> that Woods and his company , ETW Corporation , committed several acts including breach of contract , breach of implied duty of good faith , and violations of Florida 's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act . Palmer was also named in the counter @-@ suit , accused of violating the same licensing agreement in conjunction with his company Arnold Palmer Enterprises . 
 On March 12 , 2014 , a Florida jury found in favor of Gotta Have It on its breach of contract and other related claims , rejected ETW 's counterclaims , and awarded Gotta Have It $ 668 @,@ 346 in damages . The award may end up exceeding $ 1 million once interest has been factored in , though the ruling may be appealed .

 According to Golf Digest , Woods made $ 769 @,@ 440 @,@ 709 from 1996 to 2007 , and the magazine predicted that by 2010 , Woods would pass one billion dollars in earnings . In 2009 , Forbes confirmed that Woods was indeed the world 's first athlete to earn over a billion dollars in his career ( before taxes ) , after accounting for the $ 10 million bonus Woods received for the FedEx Cup title . The same year , Forbes estimated his net worth to be $ 600 million , making him the second richest " African American " behind only Oprah Winfrey . In 2015 , Woods ranked ninth in Forbes ' list of world 's highest @-@ paid athletes , being the top among " Asian Americans " or the fourth among " African Americans " .

 Early in Woods ' career , a small number of golf experts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of professional golf . Sportswriter Bill Lyon of Knight @-@ Ridder asked in a column , " Isn 't Tiger Woods actually bad for golf ? " ( though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not ) . At first , some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week . 
 A related effect was measured by economist Jennifer Brown of the University of California , Berkeley who found that other golfers played worse when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament . The scores of highly skilled ( exempt ) golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods . This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well @-@ publicized slump in 2003 – 04 . Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort , but that , when facing a " superstar " competitor , extra exertion does not significantly raise one 's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion , leading to reduced effort . 
 Many courses in the PGA Tour rotation ( including Major Championship sites like Augusta National ) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods , a strategy that became known as " Tiger @-@ <unk> " . Woods said he welcomed the change , in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win . 
 = = Career achievements = = 
 Woods has won 79 official PGA Tour events , including 14 majors . He is 14 – 1 when going into the final round of a major with at least a share of the lead . He has been heralded as " the greatest closer in history " by multiple golf experts . He owns the lowest career scoring average and the most career earnings of any player in PGA Tour history . 
 Woods victory at the 2013 Players Championship also marked a win in his 300th PGA Tour start . He also won golf tournaments in his 100th ( in 2000 ) and 200th ( in 2006 ) tour starts . 
 Woods has spent the most consecutive and cumulative weeks atop the world rankings . He is one of five players ( along with Gene Sarazen , Ben Hogan , Gary Player , and Jack Nicklaus ) to have won all four professional major championships in his career , known as the Career Grand Slam , and was the youngest to do so . Woods is the only player to have won all four professional major championships in a row , accomplishing the feat in the 2000 – 2001 seasons .

 When Woods first joined the professional tour in 1996 , his long drives had a large impact on the world of golf . However , when he did not upgrade his equipment in the following years ( insisting upon the use of True Temper Dynamic Gold steel @-@ shafted clubs and smaller steel <unk> that promoted accuracy over distance ) , many opponents caught up to him . Phil Mickelson even made a joke in 2003 about Woods using " inferior equipment " , which did not sit well with Nike , Titleist or Woods . During 2004 , Woods finally upgraded his driver technology to a larger <unk> and graphite shaft , which , coupled with his <unk> speed , made him one of the Tour 's lengthiest players off the tee once again . 
 Despite his power advantage , Woods has always focused on developing an excellent all @-@ around game . Although in recent years he has typically been near the bottom of the Tour rankings in driving accuracy , his iron play is generally accurate , his recovery and bunker play is very strong , and his putting ( especially under pressure ) is possibly his greatest asset . He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers , and is known for putting in more hours of practice than most . 
 From mid @-@ 1993 , while he was still an amateur , until 2004 , Woods worked almost exclusively with leading swing coach Butch Harmon . From mid @-@ 1997 , Harmon and Woods fashioned a major redevelopment of Woods ' full swing , achieving greater consistency , better distance control , and better kinesiology . The changes began to pay off in 1999 . From March 2004 to 2010 , Woods was coached by Hank Haney , who worked on flattening his swing plane . Woods continued to win tournaments with Haney , but his driving accuracy dropped significantly . Haney resigned in May 2010 and was replaced by Sean Foley . 
 Mike " Fluff " Cowan served as Woods ' caddy from the start of his professional career until Tiger fired him in March 1999 . He was replaced by Steve Williams , who became a close friend of Woods and is often credited with helping him with key shots and putts . In June 2011 , Woods fired Williams and replaced him with friend Bryon Bell on an interim basis . Joe <unk> , a former caddy of both Fred Couples and Dustin Johnson , was hired by Woods shortly after , and has remained Woods ' caddie since then .

 The Tiger Woods Foundation was established in 1996 by Woods and his father Earl , with the primary goal of promoting golf among inner @-@ city children . The foundation has conducted junior golf clinics across the country , and sponsors the Tiger Woods Foundation National Junior Golf Team in the Junior World Golf Championships . As of December 2010 , TWF employed approximately 55 people . 
 The foundation operates the Tiger Woods Learning Center , a $ 50 million , 35 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot facility in Anaheim , California , providing college @-@ access programs for underserved youth .

 The foundation benefits from the annual Chevron World Challenge and AT & T National golf tournaments hosted by Woods . In October 2011 , the foundation hosted the first Tiger Woods Invitational at Pebble Beach .

 = = = Tiger Woods Design = = = 
 In November 2006 , Woods announced his intention to begin designing golf courses around the world through a new company , Tiger Woods Design . A month later , he announced that the company 's first course would be in Dubai as part of a 25 @.@ 3 million @-@ square @-@ foot development , The Tiger Woods Dubai . The Al <unk> Golf Course was initially expected to finish construction in 2009 . As of February 2010 , only seven holes had been completed ; in April 2011 , The New York Times reported that the project had been shelved permanently . In 2013 , the partnership between Tiger Woods Design and Dubai Holding was dissolved . 
 Tiger Woods Design has taken on two other courses , neither of which has materialized . In August 2007 , Woods announced The Cliffs at High Carolina , a private course in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Asheville , North Carolina . After a groundbreaking in November 2008 , the project suffered cash flow problems and suspended construction . A third course , in Punta Brava , Mexico , was announced in October 2008 , but incurred delays due to issues with permits and an environmental impact study . Construction on the Punta Brava course has not yet begun . 
 The problems encountered by these projects have been credited to factors including overly optimistic estimates of their value ; declines throughout the global economy , particularly the U.S. crash in home prices ; and decreased appeal of Woods following his 2009 infidelity scandal .

 On November 25 , 2009 , The National Enquirer published a story claiming that Woods had an extramarital affair with New York City nightclub manager Rachel <unk> , a claim she denied . Two days later , around 2 : 30 a.m. on November 27 , Woods left home in his Cadillac Escalade SUV and , while still on his street , collided with a fire hydrant , a tree , and several hedges . He was treated for minor facial lacerations and received a ticket for careless driving . Following intense media speculation about the accident , Woods released a statement on his website taking sole responsibility for the accident , calling it a " private matter " and crediting his wife for helping him from the car . On November 30 , Woods announced that he would not be appearing at his own charity golf tournament , the Chevron World Challenge , nor any other tournaments in 2009 , due to his injuries . 
 On December 2 , following Us Weekly 's prior day reporting of a purported mistress and subsequent release of a voicemail message allegedly left by Woods for the woman , Woods released a further statement ; there , he admitted " transgressions " and apologized to " all of those who have supported [ him ] over the years " , while reiterating his and his family 's right to privacy . Over the next few days , more than a dozen women claimed in various media outlets to have had affairs with Woods . On December 11 , he released a third statement admitting to infidelity and apologizing again , as well as announcing that he would be taking " an indefinite break from professional golf . " 
 In the days and months following Woods ' admission of infidelity , several companies re @-@ evaluated their relationships with him . Accenture , AT & T , Gatorade and General Motors completely ended their sponsorship deals , while Gillette suspended advertising featuring Woods . TAG Heuer dropped Woods from advertising in December 2009 and officially ended their deal when his contract expired in August 2011 . The magazine Golf Digest suspended Woods ' monthly column beginning with the February 2010 issue . In contrast , Nike continued to support Woods , as did Electronic Arts , which was working with Woods on the game Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online . A December 2009 study estimated the shareholder loss caused by Woods ' affairs to be between $ 5 billion and $ 12 billion . 
 On February 19 , 2010 , Woods gave a televised statement in which he said he had been in a 45 @-@ day therapy program since the end of December . He again apologized for his actions . " I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to , " he said . " I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me . I felt I was entitled . Thanks to money and fame , I didn 't have to go far to find them . I was wrong . I was foolish . " He said he did not know yet when he would be returning to golf . He announced a few weeks later on March 16 that he would be returning at the 2010 Masters Tournament on April 8 .

 From childhood , Woods was raised as a Buddhist , and he actively practiced this faith from childhood until well into his adult professional golf career . In a 2000 article , Woods was quoted as saying he " believes in Buddhism ... Not every aspect , but most of it . " He has attributed his deviations and infidelity to his losing track of Buddhism . He said , " Buddhism teaches me to stop following every impulse and to learn restraint . Obviously I lost track of what I was taught . " 
 Woods is registered to vote as an independent . In January 2009 , Woods delivered a speech commemorating the military at the We Are One : The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial . In April 2009 , Woods visited the White House while in the Washington , D.C. , area promoting the golf tournament he hosts , the AT & T National . 
 Woods underwent laser eye surgery in 1999 . Before this surgery , Woods ' eyesight was minus 11 . He considered the surgery a big help in his career and a good alternative to the glasses and contact lenses . He immediately started winning tour events after the surgery . He received money from TLC Laser Eye Centers to endorse them . In 2007 , he had a second laser eye surgery when his vision began to deteriorate again . 
 On March 18 , 2013 , Woods announced that he and skier Lindsey <unk> were dating . They split up in May 2015 . 
 = French battleship Suffren = 
 Suffren was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship of the French Navy , launched in July 1899 . She was named after French Vice Admiral Pierre André de Suffren de Saint Tropez . The ship was originally intended to be a modified version of the Iéna design with more firepower and better armour . Before World War I Suffren had an eventful career as she twice collided with French ships and twice had propeller shafts break . She was quickly sent to the Dardanelles after the beginning of the war to reinforce British forces already there . 
 Suffren joined the British ships in multiple bombardments of the Ottoman fortifications at the mouth of the Dardanelles . She was moderately damaged during the major action of 18 March 1915 and had to be sent to Toulon for repairs . Upon their completion she returned to provide gunfire support for the Allied forces during the Gallipoli Campaign . The ship provided covering fire as the Allies withdrew from the peninsula and accidentally sank one of the evacuation ships . After repairs she was assigned to the French squadron assigned to prevent any interference by the Greeks with Allied operations on the Salonica front . While en route to Lorient for a refit Suffren was torpedoed off Lisbon on 26 November 1916 and sunk with all hands . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 To save time Suffren was only intended to be an updated version of Iéna with modest improvements in armament and armour , but the number of improvements grew as the project was discussed by the Naval Council ( French : Conseil des <unk> de la Marine ) so that she was essentially a new design , only retaining some of Iéna 's layout . The biggest changes were the mounting of the bulk of the secondary armament in turrets , rather than Iéna 's casemates , and the constant thickness of the waterline belt armour compared to Iéna 's belt which thinned towards the ends of the ship . <unk> of shells for the main armament also increased from 45 to 60 rounds per gun .

 Suffren was slightly larger than Iéna being 125 @.@ 91 metres ( 413 ft 1 in ) long overall . She had a beam of 21 @.@ 42 metres ( 70 ft 3 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 39 metres ( 24 ft 3 in ) forward and 8 @.@ 22 metres ( 27 @.@ 0 ft ) aft .

Suffren was only 3 @.@ 55 metres ( 11 ft 8 in ) longer and displaced over 700 metric tons ( 700 long tons ) more than the earlier ship . She was fitted with bilge keels to reduce her rolling .

The engines were rated at 16 @,@ 200 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 100 kW ) and produced 16 @,@ 809 ihp ( 12 @,@ 534 kW ) and gave a top speed of 17 @.@ 91 knots ( 33 @.@ 17 km / h ; 20 @.@ 61 mph ) on sea trials , just slightly less than her designed speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . The ship carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 233 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 214 long tons ) of coal which allowed her to steam for 3 @,@ 086 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 715 km ; 3 @,@ 551 mi ) at a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . 52 @.@ 15 metric tons ( 51 @.@ 33 long tons ) of fuel oil was carried to be sprayed on the coal to improve its burn rate . The ship 's 80 V electrical power was provided by two 600 @-@ ampere and three 1200 @-@ ampere dynamos . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Like the Iéna which preceded her , the Suffren carried her main armament of four 40 @-@ calibre Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893 / 96 guns in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one each fore and aft . The guns had a maximum elevation of 15 ° . They fired 340 @-@ kilogram ( 750 lb ) projectiles at the theoretical rate of one round per minute . They had a muzzle velocity of 780 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ) which gave a range of 12 @,@ 000 metres ( 13 @,@ 000 yd ) at maximum elevation . Suffren carried 60 rounds for each gun . 
 The ship 's secondary armament consisted of ten 45 @-@ calibre Canon de 164 mm Modèle 1893 guns . Six of these were carried in single turrets on each side of the superstructure and the remaining four were mounted in individual casemates below them on the 1st Deck . The casemates were sponsoned out over the tumblehome of the sides . The guns fired 52 @-@ kilogram ( 115 lb ) shells at a muzzle velocity of 865 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 840 ft / s ) to a maximum range of 9 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 yd ) . Their theoretical rate of fire was between two and three rounds per minute . She carried 1906 shells for these guns . Suffren also carried eight 45 @-@ calibre Canon de 100 mm Modèle 1893 guns in shielded mounts on the shelter deck and on the superstructure . These guns fired a 12 @-@ kilogram ( 26 lb ) projectile at 710 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 300 ft / s ) , which could be trained up to 20 ° for a maximum range of 9 @,@ 500 metres ( 10 @,@ 400 yd ) . Their theoretical maximum rate of fire was six rounds per minute , but only three rounds per minute sustained . The ship carried <unk> shells for these guns . 
 Twenty 50 @-@ calibre Canon de 47 mm Modèle 1885 Hotchkiss guns were mounted as anti @-@ torpedo boat guns . They were mounted in the fighting tops and on the superstructure . They fired a 1 @.@ 49 @-@ kilogram ( 3 @.@ 3 lb ) projectile at 610 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ) to a maximum range of 4 @,@ 000 metres ( 4 @,@ 400 yd ) . Their theoretical maximum rate of fire was fifteen rounds per minute , but only seven rounds per minute sustained . Suffren carried 15 @,@ 000 rounds for these 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) guns . Two 37 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Modèle 1885 Hotchkiss guns were mounted on the upper bridge . They fired a shell weighing about .48 kilograms ( 1 @.@ 1 lb ) at a muzzle velocity of about 610 m / s ( 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ) to a range about 3 @,@ 200 metres ( 3 @,@ 500 yd ) . Their rate of fire was about 25 rounds per minute . 
 Four 450 mm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes were also carried . Two tubes were submerged , abaft the forward turret , and fixed at a 30 ° angle to the beam . The two above @-@ water tubes had a central pivot and limited traverse . Twelve reserve Modèle 1892 torpedoes were carried , of which eight were combat models . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 Suffren had a complete waterline armour belt of Harvey armour that was 2 @.@ 5 metres ( 8 ft 2 in ) high and 300 millimetres ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) thick . The lower edge of this belt was a uniform 120 millimetres ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) in thickness . The upper armour belt protected the casemates and was 110 millimetres ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) thick . The maximum thickness of the armoured deck was 60 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) and the fore and aft armoured transverse bulkheads were 110 mm thick . 
 The main turret armour was 290 millimetres ( 11 @.@ 4 in ) in thickness with a 50 @-@ millimetre ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) roof and the barbettes were protected by 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) of armour . The armour for the secondary turrets ranged from 102 millimetres ( 4 @.@ 0 in ) thick at the front to 192 millimetres ( 7 @.@ 6 in ) at the rear . The conning tower had walls 224 – 274 millimetres ( 8 @.@ 8 – 10 @.@ 8 in ) thick and its communications tube was protected by 150 millimetres ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) of armour .

 Suffren , named after the French admiral Pierre André de Suffren de Saint @-@ Tropez , was ordered on 21 April 1898 from the Arsenal de Brest . She was laid down on 5 January 1899 and launched on 25 July of the same year . Her fitting @-@ out was delayed by late delivery of fittings and armour from July 1900 . Suffren began her sea trials in November 1903 , but was not commissioned until 3 February 1904 . On 18 August 1903 she participated in a gunnery trial with the pre @-@ dreadnought Masséna off Île Longue . A mild steel plate 55 centimetres ( 21 @.@ 7 in ) thick , measuring 225 by 95 centimetres ( 7 ft 5 in by 3 ft 1 in ) , was attached to the side of Suffren 's forward turret to determine the resistance of an armour plate to a large @-@ calibre shell . Masséna anchored 100 metres ( 330 ft ) away from Suffren and fired a number of 305 @-@ millimetre ( 12 in ) shells at the plate . The first three were training shells that knocked splinters off the armour plate . The last two shells , fired with full charges , cracked the plate , but Suffren 's turret was fully operational , as was her Germain electrical fire @-@ control system and the six sheep placed in the turret were unharmed . One splinter struck Masséna above her armour belt and left a 15 @-@ centimetre sized hole in her hull . Another 50 @-@ kilogram ( 110 lb ) splinter landed within a few metres of the Naval Minister , Camille <unk> , who was observing the trials . 
 When Suffren commissioned on 3 February 1904 she was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron and became the flagship of its commander Vice Admiral Gourdon a few days later on 10 February . In April she carried the President of France , Émile Loubet on a state visit to Naples . As time went by several defects were revealed in service , including the weakness of the underpowered capstan which was barely capable of raising the anchor in waters 15 – 20 metres ( 49 – 66 ft ) deep . Another problem was that the centre engine and its propeller shaft tended to overheat excessively . During fleet exercises off the Îles des Hyères on 5 February 1906 Suffren rammed the submarine Bonite when the latter miscalculated the fleet 's movements while manoeuvring into firing position . Bonite rose to periscope depth less than 30 metres ( 98 ft ) in front of Suffren , but the latter managed to turn quickly enough while Bonite was crash @-@ diving that Suffren struck Bonite a glancing blow . This was enough , however , to breach two compartments abreast the ship 's starboard engine room and she had to be docked at Toulon for emergency repairs . Bonite 's bow was crushed and several of her ballast tanks were ripped open . Only by rapidly dropping her weighted keel was the submarine able to avoid sinking . No casualties were suffered by either vessel . 
 During the summer of 1906 Suffren 's above @-@ water torpedo tubes were removed . She was drydocked adjacent to Iéna on 12 March 1907 at Toulon when the latter ship 's magazine exploded . Burning fragments started a small fire aboard Suffren , but she was not otherwise damaged by the explosion . In early 1908 a 2 @-@ metre ( 6 ft 7 in ) Barr and Stroud rangefinder was mounted on the navigation bridge . During manoeuvres off Golfe @-@ Juan on 13 August 1908 the ship 's port propeller shaft broke and the propeller fell off in water 26 metres ( 85 ft ) deep . While a new shaft was ordered from Indret , Iéna 's corresponding shaft was used with such success that the ship 's engineers requested to keep it in place and save the new shaft as a spare . This proposal was rejected by the Naval Ministry and the offending shaft was exchanged . The opportunity was also taken to successfully rework the centre propeller shaft 's mounting so that it would overheat less often . In November 1910 the starboard propeller shaft broke and the propeller was lost in deep water . No shaft was immediately available so Suffren had to wait three months for repairs . In the meantime , however , her boilers were overhauled . On 14 February 1911 the port anchor chain broke , killing one sailor and injuring two others . During another fleet exercise on 28 May 1914 Suffren suddenly lost power and was struck by the battleship Démocratie . She was only lightly damaged with her port anchor and hawsepipe carried away . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 Shortly after the war began Suffren was fitted with additional Barr and <unk> rangefinders near the bridge . Two of these were mounted on transverse rails fore and aft of the bridge . The after bulkhead was removed and the two 100 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) guns on the side of the superstructure were moved one deck lower . On 26 September 1914 Suffren and the battleship Vérité were ordered to the Dardanelles to assist British ships in blockading the Dardanelles to prevent any sortie by the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and the light cruiser SMS Breslau back into the Mediterranean . On 3 November the two French pre @-@ dreadnoughts joined British ships bombarding the Ottoman fortifications at the mouth of the Dardanelles . The short , eleven @-@ minute , bombardment by the French did little damage , but alerted the Ottomans that their defences there required strengthening . On 16 November Suffren sailed for Toulon for a lengthy refit . 
 Suffren returned to the Dardanelles on 9 January 1915 and became the flagship of the squadron of four French battleships , commanded by Rear @-@ Admiral Émile Guépratte . She bombarded the Turkish fort of Kum Kale , on the Asian side of the strait on 19 February . Bouvet assisted Suffren by sending firing corrections via radio while Gaulois provided counter @-@ battery fire to suppress the Ottoman coastal artillery . Late in the day the British pre @-@ dreadnought HMS Vengeance was bombarding the fort at <unk> Tepe on the Asiatic side of the strait and began taking heavy fire as she approached the fort . The British battlecruiser HMS Inflexible attempted to suppress the Ottoman coast @-@ defense guns to allow Vengeance to extricate herself , but was unsuccessful . Suffren and Gaulois had to combine their fire with that of Inflexible before Vengeance could successfully withdraw . Suffren fired thirty 305 @-@ millimetre shells and 227 164 @-@ millimetre shells during the day . 
 Suffren also participated in a more limited way in the bombardment of 25 February against the same targets , but this was far more successful as Suffren and the other ships moved as close as 3 @,@ 000 yards ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) to the forts . On 2 March the French squadron bombarded targets in the Gulf of Saros , at the base of the Gallipoli Peninsula . On 7 March the French squadron attempted to suppress the Turkish guns while British battleships bombarded the fortifications . Admiral Guépratte and his squadron returned to the Gulf of Saros on 11 March where they again bombarded Turkish fortifications . 
 They returned to assist in the major attack on the fortifications planned for 18 March . British ships made the initial entry into the Dardanelles , but the French ships passed through them to engage the forts at closer range . Shortly after having done so Suffren was under heavy fire and was struck no less than 14 times in 15 minutes . Most did no significant damage , including a 24 @-@ centimetre ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) that bounced off the after 305 @-@ millimetre turret , but one 24 @-@ centimetre shell ricocheted off the port midships 164 @-@ millimetre turret and ripped the roof off the port casemate , killing the entire gun crew . Some flaming debris dropped into that gun 's magazine and started a fire , but it was quickly flooded to prevent an explosion . Another shell tore a hole 80 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) across in the bow which flooded the base of the forward turret . While the French Squadron was withdrawing pursuant to Admiral de Robeck 's order Bouvet struck a mine and sank in 55 seconds . Suffren lowered her admiral 's barge , her only intact boat , and rescued 75 men before she had to escort the badly @-@ damaged Gaulois away from the Dardanelles . The latter was taking on water by the bow and had to be beached on one of the Rabbit Islands at the entrance of the Dardanelles before she sank . 
 Suffren was ordered to escort Gaulois to Toulon via Malta on 25 March . Two days later the ships encountered a storm and were forced to seek refuge in the Bay of Navarin . Suffren arrived at Toulon on 3 April and was repaired by 20 May when she returned to the Dardanelles to provide gunfire support for the troops ashore . She remained in the area until she fired her last mission on 31 December . Upon returning to her anchorage at <unk> , on the island of Kos , she collided with , and sank , the British steamer Saint Oswald , a horse transport involved in the evacuation from Gallipoli , and was badly damaged . Suffren arrived in Toulon on 20 January 1916 for repairs which were done by April . That month she joined the French squadron of six pre @-@ dreadnoughts assigned to prevent any interference by the Greeks with Allied operations on the Salonica front . On 9 July Suffren became flagship of the squadron when Patrie departed for a refit at Toulon . On 7 October Patrie , Démocratie , and Suffren entered the harbour of Eleusina prepared to fire on the Greek pre @-@ dreadnoughts Kilkis , Limnos and the cruiser Elli , but things were resolved peacefully and the French ship returned to their harbour . 
 Suffren was originally intended to refit at the naval base at Bizerte , but the location was switched when the dockyard at Lorient informed the Naval Staff that it had room for her . On 15 November the ship departed to recoal at Bizerte which she reached on 18 November . She sailed on 20 November for Gibraltar ; heavy weather en route delayed her arrival until 23 November . Suffren <unk> and departed Gibraltar the following day , without an escort . On the morning of 26 November , roughly 50 nautical miles ( 92 @.@ 6 km ; 57 @.@ 5 mi ) off the Portuguese coast near Lisbon , she was torpedoed by the German submarine SM U @-@ 52 , en route to the Austro @-@ Hungarian naval base at Cattaro . The torpedo detonated a magazine and Suffren sank within seconds , taking her entire crew of 648 with her . U @-@ 52 searched the scene but found no survivors . 
 = Floorless Coaster = 
 A Floorless Coaster is a type of steel roller coaster manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders sit with no floor underneath them allowing their feet to swing freely just above the track . Development of the Floorless Coaster began between 1995 and 1996 with Medusa ( now known as Bizarro ) at Six Flags Great Adventure opening on April 2 , 1999 , making it the world 's first Floorless Coaster . Floorless Coasters also tend to have 3 to 7 inversions incorporated in the layout of the coaster . Recently , Bolliger & Mabillard have used floorless trains on their Dive Coasters , such as Griffon and SheiKra . Though they contain floorless trains , the coasters are still not considered Floorless Coasters as B & M classifies them as another model . Also , Maurer Söhne have designed their own version of the Floorless Coaster , a variant of their X @-@ Car called X @-@ Car Floorless , but currently do not have any installations .

 According to Walter Bolliger , development of the Floorless Coaster began between 1995 and 1996 . In 1999 , the world 's first Floorless Coaster opened at Six Flags Great Adventure as Medusa . In 2009 , the coaster was renamed Bizarro and re @-@ themed . After the success of Bolliger & Mabillard 's prototype Floorless Coaster , SeaWorld , Cedar Fair , Six Flags , and independent parks , <unk> <unk> , Parque Warner Madrid , Tivoli Gardens , and Ocean Park Hong Kong have built other coasters of this model at their parks . There are currently 14 Floorless Coasters in operation with Dominator being the only one relocated to another park . 
 = = Design = = 
 The design of a Floorless Coaster has one main difference from traditional steel roller coasters around the world : it has no floors between the seats . While a train is in the station , a floor is used only for loading and unloading purposes . Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking over the edge of the station , a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening . Once all the over @-@ the @-@ shoulder restraints are locked , the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station . The gate then opens , allowing the train to move forward . When the train returns to the station , the floor is brought back up and the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster . Aside from the station , a Floorless Coaster has several inversions similar to B & M 's Sitting Coaster 's .

 Bolliger & Mabillard has built thirteen Floorless Coasters with an additional roller coaster converted from a Stand @-@ up Coaster . The roller coasters are listed in order of opening dates .

 Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson was born in Santa Barbara , California , to Pentecostal pastors Mary Christine ( née Perry ) and Maurice Keith Hudson . Her parents are born again Christians , each having turned to God after a " wild youth " . Perry has English , German , Irish , and Portuguese ancestry . Through her mother , she is a niece of film director Frank Perry . She has a younger brother named David , who is a singer , and an older sister , Angela . From ages 3 to 11 , Perry often moved across the country as her parents set up churches before settling again in Santa Barbara . Growing up , she attended religious schools and camps , including Paradise Valley Christian School in Arizona and Santa Barbara Christian School in California during her elementary years . Her family struggled financially , sometimes using food stamps and eating from the food bank intended to feed the congregation at her parents ' church . 
 Growing up , Perry and her siblings were not allowed to eat Lucky Charms as the term " luck " reminded their mother of Lucifer , and had to call deviled eggs " <unk> eggs " . Perry primarily listened to gospel music , as secular music was generally discouraged in the family 's home . She discovered popular music through CDs she sneaked from her friends . While not strictly identifying as religious , Perry has stated , " I pray all the time – for self @-@ control , for humility . " Following her sister Angela , Perry began singing by practicing with her sister 's cassette tapes . She performed the tracks in front of their parents , who suggested she take vocal lessons . She began training at age 9 , and was incorporated into her parents ' ministry , singing in church from ages 9 to 17 . At 13 , Perry was given her first guitar for her birthday , and publicly performed songs she wrote . She tried to " be a bit like the typical Californian girl " while growing up , and started rollerskating , skateboarding , and surfing as a teenager . David described her as a tomboy during her adolescence . She took dancing lessons and learned how to swing , Lindy Hop , and jitterbug .

 During her freshman year of high school , Perry completed her General Educational Development ( GED ) requirements at age 15 , and left Dos Pueblos High School to pursue a musical career . She briefly studied Italian opera at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara . Her singing caught the attention of rock artists Steve Thomas and Jennifer Knapp from Nashville , Tennessee , who brought her there to improve her writing skills . In Nashville , she started recording demos and learned how to write songs and play guitar . After signing with Red Hill Records , Perry recorded her debut album , a gospel record titled Katy Hudson . She released the album on March 6 , 2001 , and went on tour that year as part of Phil Joel 's Strangely Normal Tour . Katy Hudson received positive reviews from critics , though was commercially unsuccessful and sold an estimated 200 copies before the label ceased operations in December . Transitioning from gospel music to secular music , Perry started writing songs with producer Glen Ballard , and moved to Los Angeles at age 17 . In 2003 , she briefly performed as Katheryn Perry to avoid confusion with actress Kate Hudson . She later adopted the stage name Katy Perry , using her mother 's maiden name . 
 In 2004 , Perry signed to Ballard 's label , Java , which was then affiliated with The Island Def Jam Music Group . She began work on a solo record , but the record was shelved after Java was dropped . Ballard then introduced Perry to Tim Devine , an A & R executive at Columbia Records , and she was signed as a solo artist . Over the course of the next two years , Perry wrote and recorded material for her Columbia debut , and worked with songwriters including Desmond Child , Greg Wells , Butch Walker , Scott Cutler / Anne Previn , The Matrix , Kara DioGuardi , and Max Martin and Dr. Luke . In addition , after Devine suggested they become a " real group " , she recorded with the Matrix . Perry was dropped from Columbia in 2006 as her record neared completion . After she was dropped from Columbia , Perry worked at an independent A & R company called Taxi Music . 
 Perry had minor success prior to her breakthrough . One of the songs she had recorded for her album with Ballard , " Simple " , was featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants . She provided backing vocals on Mick Jagger 's song " Old Habits Die Hard " , which was included on the soundtrack to the 2004 film Alfie . In September 2004 , Blender named Perry " The Next Big Thing " . She recorded background vocals on P.O.D. ' s single " Goodbye for Now " and was featured at the end of its music video in 2006 . That year , Perry also appeared in the music video for " Learn to Fly " by Carbon Leaf , and played the love interest of her then @-@ boyfriend , Gym Class Heroes lead singer Travie McCoy , in the band 's music video for " Cupid 's <unk> " .

 After Columbia dropped Perry , Angelica Cob @-@ Baehler , then a publicity executive at the label , brought Perry 's demos to Virgin Records chairman Jason Flom . Flom was convinced that she could be a breakthrough star and she was signed to Capitol Records in April 2007 . The label arranged for her to work with Dr. Luke in order to add an " undeniable smash " to her existing material . Perry and Dr. Luke co @-@ wrote the songs " I Kissed a Girl " and " Hot n Cold " for her second album One of the Boys . A campaign was started with the November 2007 release of the video to " Ur So Gay " , aimed at introducing her to the music market . A digital EP led by " Ur So Gay " was later released to create interest . Madonna helped publicize the song by praising the track on the <unk> & Rich radio show in April 2008 , stating it was her " favorite song " . In March 2008 , Perry made a cameo appearance as a club singer in the Wildfire episode " Life 's Too Short " , and appeared as herself during a photo shoot in June on The Young and the Restless for the show 's magazine Restless Style . 
 Perry released her first single with Capitol , " I Kissed a Girl " , on April 28 , 2008 , as the lead single from One of the Boys . The first station to pick up the song was <unk> in Nashville , who were inundated with enthusiastic calls the first three days they played it . The track reached number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 . One of the Boys , released on June 17 , garnered mixed critical reviews and reached number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200 . The album went on to sell 7 million copies worldwide . " Hot n Cold " was released in September and became the album 's second successful single , reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100 , while topping charts in Germany , Canada , the Netherlands , and Austria . Later singles " Thinking of You " and " Waking Up in Vegas " were released in 2009 and reached the top 30 of the Hot 100 . The Matrix 's self @-@ titled debut album , which Perry had recorded with the band in 2004 , was released onto iTunes on January 27 , 2009 , as a result of her solo success . 
 After finishing the Warped Tour 2008 , Perry hosted the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2008 , where she won the award for Best New Act . She embarked on her first headlining world tour , the Hello Katy Tour , from January to November 2009 to support One of the Boys . On August 4 , 2009 , she performed as opening act for one date of the band No Doubt 's Summer Tour 2009 . Perry also hosted the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2009 , becoming the first person to host two consecutive ceremonies . On July 22 , 2009 , Perry recorded a live album titled MTV Unplugged , which featured acoustic performances of five tracks from One of the Boys , as well as two new songs , " Brick by Brick " and " Hackensack " . It was released on November 17 , 2009 . Perry also appeared on two singles with other artists ; she was featured on a remix of Colorado @-@ based band 3OH ! 3 's song " <unk> " in September 2009 , and on a duet with Timbaland entitled " If We Ever Meet Again " , from his album Shock Value II , in January 2010 . The Guinness World Records recognized her in its 2010 edition as the " Best Start on the U.S. Digital Chart by a Female Artist " , for digital single sales of over two million copies . 
 " I Kissed a Girl " created controversy among both religious groups and LGBT groups . The former criticized its homosexual themes while the latter accused her of using bi @-@ curiosity to sell records . In response to speculation that her parents opposed her music and career , Perry told MTV that they had no problems with her success . After her relationship with McCoy ended in December 2008 , Perry met her future husband Russell Brand in the summer of 2009 while filming a cameo appearance for his film Get Him to the Greek . Her scene , in which the two kiss , does not appear in the film . She began dating Brand after meeting him again that September at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards . The couple became engaged on December 31 , 2009 , while vacationing in Rajasthan , India .

 The history of Liverpool Football Club from 1959 to 1985 covers the period from the appointment of Bill Shankly as manager of the then @-@ Second Division club , to the Heysel Stadium disaster and its aftermath . 
 Overhauling the team during his first year at Liverpool , Shankly released 24 players and converted a boot storage room into a meeting place where he and his coaches discussed strategy . The club won the Second Division title in 1961 – 62 and were promoted to the First Division . Two seasons later , Liverpool won their first League championship since 1946 – 47 , thereby qualifying for participation in European competition for the first time . The following season , Liverpool won their first FA Cup . Further League championships followed in 1965 – 66 and 1972 – 73 . 1973 saw them win their first European trophy — the UEFA Cup . The following season was Shankly 's last , in which the club won the FA Cup once more . 
 Shankly 's assistant Bob Paisley took over in 1974 ; his first season in charge saw Liverpool finish second , before winning the League championship and UEFA Cup the following season . Three European Cups and four League championships followed before Paisley retired at the end of 1982 – 83 , to be replaced by his assistant , Joe Fagan . 
 Liverpool won a treble of trophies during Fagan 's first season as manager , winning the League championship for the third year in succession , the Football League Cup for the fourth year in succession and a fourth European Cup . The following season , the club was involved in one of the worst disasters to occur at a football stadium . Before the start of the 1985 European Cup Final against Juventus , Liverpool fans breached a fence separating the two groups of supporters , and charged the Juventus fans . The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse , killing 39 fans , mostly Italians . The incident became known as the Heysel Stadium disaster and resulted in the expulsion of English clubs from European competition for five years .

 Huddersfield Town 's Bill Shankly was appointed Liverpool manager midway through the 1959 – 60 season . He was approached by Liverpool chairman Tom Williams , who asked Shankly if he would like to manage " the best club in the country " , to which he replied , " Why , is Matt Busby packing up ? " A perceived lack of ambition at Huddersfield Town and the potential at Liverpool led Shankly to accept the offer . When he arrived , the club was in the Second Division , having played at this level since relegation in 1953 – 54 . During his first season in charge , Shankly gave debuts to two players : Ian Callaghan , who would go on to become the club 's record appearance maker , and Roger Hunt , the club 's future leading goalscorer in the League . 
 Despite their introduction , Shankly 's impact was not immediate , as the club finished the season in third place , outside the promotion spots . Shankly had been musing on which players to keep and which to move on , and he eventually decided that 24 players should be released ; by the end of his first season they had all left the club . Shankly retained the existing backroom staff , and converted a boot storage room into a meeting place where he and his coaches could discuss strategy . The Boot Room , as it came to be known , was to be an integral part of the club 's future success . Bob Paisley was clear on the significance of the Boot Room : " You got a more wide @-@ ranging discussion in the Boot Room than the boardroom . What went on was kept within those four walls . There was a certain mystique about the place . " 
 The club again finished third the following season , despite a run of 14 games without defeat ; 5 defeats in the opening 11 matches had cost Liverpool the chance of promotion . Shareholder John Moores believed the club needed to spend more money on players to be successful and encouraged chairman T. V. Williams to do so . The following season , Shankly signed Ian St John from Motherwell and Ron Yeats from Dundee United . Shankly was confident his signings would be a success , challenging the board of directors to " sack me if they can 't play . " St John and Yeats helped the club win promotion to the First Division ; they won the Second Division with 62 points , and were unbeaten at their home ground Anfield all season . Liverpool were back in the First Division for the first time in eight years in 1962 – 63 . Despite an uneasy start , they were in fifth place by March 1963 , after a 13 @-@ match unbeaten run . Liverpool 's form suffered following their 1 – 0 loss to Leicester City in the FA Cup semi @-@ final , and a poor run of results including a 7 – 2 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur saw the club finish the season in eighth place . 
 The following season , Shankly signed Peter Thompson from Preston North End as he could play wide on the right @-@ hand side of midfield . Liverpool started 1963 – 64 poorly , garnering only nine points from the first nine games . A 2 – 1 victory over Everton , their first win over their local rivals since 1950 , instigated Liverpool 's move up the table . They won 47 points from their next 30 games to secure their sixth League championship . Success led to the average attendance at Anfield increasing to more than 50 @,@ 000 . The fans also became more vocal , and it was around this time that the fans on the Kop adopted You 'll Never Walk Alone as their anthem . 
 Liverpool 's League championship qualified them to participate in European competition for the first time , in the 1964 – 65 European Cup . For their second round tie against Belgian team Anderlecht , Shankly decided to change from red shirts , white shorts and socks to an all @-@ red kit . Shankly felt the players would be more intimidating to the opposition as a result . Liverpool reached the semi @-@ final , but were beaten by Italian club Internazionale . The tie was not without controversy ; Shankly felt that the referee showed bias towards Internazionale , as he had allowed questionable goals by the Italians to stand . Liverpool 's form in the European Cup carried over into the FA Cup , in which they reached the final against Leeds United . The game was goalless for the first 90 minutes , but Liverpool took the lead in extra time , courtesy of a goal by Hunt . Leeds equalised shortly afterwards , but a St John goal secured a 2 – 1 victory for Liverpool , and their first FA Cup triumph . Liverpool 's form in cup competitions did not translate to their performance in the League , as the defence of their championship ended with the club finishing in seventh place .

 Victory in the FA Cup meant Liverpool would participate in the European Cup Winners ' Cup during 1965 – 66 . They went one stage further than the previous season , as they reached the final , facing German team Borussia Dortmund . The two sides were level at 1 – 1 at the end of 90 minutes and the match went into extra time . Liverpool were unable to score and conceded a goal to Dortmund , who won the match 2 – 1 . Shankly was unimpressed with his team 's performance , stating : " We didn 't play well and we gave away two silly goals . " Their defence of the FA Cup ended in the third round , after defeat to Chelsea . Their lack of success in cup competitions was offset by regaining the League championship on the last day of April 1966 when they beat Chelsea , courtesy of two goals from Hunt . 
 The next few seasons were not as successful . A return to the European Cup in 1966 – 67 saw Liverpool eliminated 7 – 3 on aggregate by Dutch side Ajax in the second round . The League campaign was equally disappointing , as the team finished the season in fifth place , winning only 2 of their last 11 games . One significant event during the season was the arrival of future captain Emlyn Hughes from Blackpool for a £ 65 @,@ 000 fee . The 1967 – 68 season started well , with Liverpool league leaders through much of September , October and November 1967 . An accumulation of matches due to participation in the Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup , FA Cup and Football League Cup impacted negatively on Liverpool 's League form . They finished the season in third place behind champions Manchester City . The 59 games Liverpool played during the season did not result in success . The furthest the club progressed in any competition was the quarter @-@ final of the FA Cup . 
 The following season saw an improvement in League form , but there was no reward . Poor performances in the cup competitions meant Liverpool had less fixture congestion than the previous season , but that did not translate into a League championship as they finished in second place , six points behind Leeds United . Shankly 's team was beginning to age , and several players had moved on or retired . Gerry Byrne , who had been the club 's left back for 12 seasons , retired after making 333 appearances . Shankly now had the task of replacing the players in his squad . He started the process with the purchase of Hughes and then Ray Clemence the season before , but his signings did not always work out . Tony Hateley joined for a club record fee of £ 96 @,@ 000 from Chelsea , but injury and poor form meant he was sold to Coventry City after a year . During the 1968 – 69 season Shankly signed Alun Evans for £ 100 @,@ 000 from Wolverhampton Wanderers , a record fee for a teenager at the time . Despite a good start , Evans suffered a series of injuries that cut his career short . 
 The 1969 – 70 season was the beginning of a transitional period for Liverpool , as players such as Hunt , St John and Yeats made their last appearances for the club . A sixth @-@ round loss to Watford in the FA Cup convinced Shankly that some of his older players should be moved on . Liverpool nevertheless started the season well , and were unbeaten in their first ten League matches until a 1 – 0 defeat to Manchester United . They were unable to maintain their early season form and finished in fifth place . Success in the other cup competitions was not forthcoming , as Liverpool exited in the early rounds of the Football League Cup and Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup . 
 = = 1970 – 75 : Transition = = 
 Shankly 's new squad began to take shape during 1970 – 71 , with many of the young players he had signed playing in the first team . As a result , the average age of the team was 22 . Players such as Clemence , Steve Heighway , Alec Lindsay and Larry Lloyd , began to establish themselves in the team . John Toshack was also signed from Cardiff City to replace Hunt . Liverpool were unable to improve upon the previous season 's League position , finishing in fifth place , but they had more success in cup competitions . They reached the semi @-@ finals of the Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup , but lost to Leeds United over two @-@ legs . Liverpool progressed to the final of the FA Cup , and played Arsenal . Although Liverpool took the lead in extra time after a goalless 90 minutes , Arsenal won 2 – 1 to complete a League and cup double . 
 Before the final against Arsenal , Shankly signed Kevin Keegan from Scunthorpe United . Keegan became a key player for Liverpool and his impact was immediate , as he scored 12 minutes into his Liverpool debut . The addition of Keegan almost helped Liverpool regain the League championship . They went into the final day of the season a point behind Derby County , who had already finished their campaign , but were unable to secure the victory they needed against Arsenal , finishing in third place . The 1972 – 73 season was when Shankly 's new Liverpool team delivered , winning the League and the club 's first European trophy , the UEFA Cup . They started the season well and were top of the League after a 5 – 0 victory over Sheffield United . They maintained that position throughout the remainder of the season , securing the League championship after a 0 – 0 draw against Leicester City . It was the club 's eighth League title , equalling the record held by Arsenal . Further success followed in the UEFA Cup , as the club reached the final against German team Borussia Mönchengladbach . A 3 – 0 victory in the first leg and a 2 – 0 loss in the second leg meant Liverpool won the tie 3 – 2 on aggregate , claiming their first European trophy . They became the first English team to win the League and a European trophy in the same season . 
 John Smith became chairman in 1973 ; his appointment was based around his business experience , with the idea of developing of a more corporate approach to the club 's decision making . He believed in continuity and ended the club 's policy of changing chairman every three years . The biggest development at Anfield in recent years occurred in 1973 , as the old Main Stand was demolished and a new one constructed . The stand was officially opened by the Duke of Kent on 10 March 1973 . Their triumph in the League meant Liverpool would compete in the 1973 – 74 European Cup . They were not as successful as the previous season and were eliminated in the second round by Yugoslav team Red Star Belgrade . Liverpool made a poor start to their League campaign , losing early on to Coventry City and Derby County , as opposed to Leeds United , who were unbeaten in their first 29 games of the season . Liverpool reduced the gap , but a poor end to the season , in which they won only one of their last eight matches , meant they finished second to Leeds . Despite their lack of success in other competitions , Liverpool reached the final of the FA Cup , beating Newcastle United 3 – 0 to win the cup for the second time . Shankly bought Ray Kennedy from Arsenal at the end of the season , which was his last act as Liverpool manager . He resigned soon afterwards , citing the need for a break , and was replaced by his assistant Bob Paisley . 
 Shankly continued to turn up at Melwood , the club 's training ground , where the players still referred to him as ' boss ' . Reluctantly , Paisley asked him to stay away from training , in order to assert his authority as manager . Liverpool started 1974 – 75 well ; they were unbeaten in their first six League matches , and recorded their biggest ever win when they beat Strømsgodset 11 – 0 in the 1974 – 75 European Cup Winners ' Cup . Liverpool were nevertheless knocked out by Hungarian side Ferencváros on the away goals rule in the next round . The club 's participation in domestic cup competitions ended early as well , being eliminated in the fourth round in the FA Cup and Football League Cup . Liverpool 's good start to the season in the League was not sustained and they eventually finished in second place . Paisley made some important signings during the course of the season . He signed Phil Neal , Terry McDermott and Jimmy Case , who would become regulars in the successful team that Paisley was to build . 
 = = 1975 – 81 : Sustained success = = 
 The 1975 – 76 season did not start well , as Liverpool lost 2 – 0 to Queens Park Rangers in their first match . Their form had not improved by mid @-@ October 1975 , by which time they had won only six of their first twelve matches . Liverpool 's form picked up in the second half of the season ; a late @-@ season run in which they dropped only one point in nine matches left them a point behind Queens Park Rangers going into their final match . Victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers would secure the League championship as Queens Park Rangers had already finished their league campaign . The match did not start well , and Liverpool were a goal behind at half @-@ time , but won the match 3 – 1 with three second @-@ half goals to win the League championship . Liverpool were eliminated early from the FA Cup and League Cup but fared better in Europe , progressing to the final of the UEFA Cup . A 4 – 3 aggregate victory over Belgian team Club Brugge meant the club won the trophy for the second time .
