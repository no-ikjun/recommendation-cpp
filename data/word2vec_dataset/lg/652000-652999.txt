 As a direct result of the rescue operation , five aircraft were lost , 11 people were killed , and two were captured . Additional aircraft were seriously damaged . Hambleton wrote from an Air Force hospital after he was rescued . " I had to stand by and watch six young men die trying to save my life . It was a hell of a price to pay for one life . I 'm very sorry . " His rescue was , according to Stars and Stripes , " the biggest U.S. air rescue effort of the war . "

 The rescue of Bat 21 was a watershed event for the military and led them to find a new approach to high @-@ threat search and rescue . They recognized that , if a SAR mission was predestined to fail , it should not be attempted , and other options , such as special operations , diversionary tactics and other creative approaches tailored to the situation , had to be considered . Recognizing the need for an aircraft that could deliver better close air support , the Air Force accepted the Navy 's A @-@ 7 Corsair . The military also improved the night capability of helicopters and area denial munitions .

 John Van Etten ( <unk> ) received the Distinguished Flying Cross for his part in this rescue . Hambleton received the Silver Star , the Distinguished Flying Cross , the Air Medal , the Meritorious Service Medal ( United States ) and a Purple Heart for his actions during this mission . For their heroic actions in rescuing Hambleton behind front lines , Lt. Thomas R. Norris was recommended for and received the Medal of Honor , although he initially declined to submit the paperwork . 
 Norris readily supported the nomination of Petty Officer Third Class Nguyen Van Kiet for the Navy Cross , the highest award that the navy can give to a foreign national . Nguyen was the only South Vietnamese Naval member awarded the Navy Cross during the Vietnam War , and one of only two South Vietnamese to receive the award . 
 Navy investigators reviewed the action , interviewed participants , and recommended Norris for the Medal of Honor . He received it from President Gerald Ford in a White House ceremony on March 6 , 1976 attended by Michael Thornton , another Navy SEAL who had saved Norris ' life on October 31 , 1972 . 
 Hundreds of individuals from dozens of units from the Air Force , Army , Navy , Marines and Coast Guard assisted in Hambleton 's rescue , and participants in the operation received a total of 234 individual medals . 
 In 1975 , Clark 's and Hambleton 's rescue was declassified .

 The remains of the crew members of HH @-@ <unk> Jolly Roger 67 — Chapman , Call , Avery , Prater , and Pearson , and Alley — were returned to the United States on October 1 , 1997 . The six were honored on November 19 , 1997 in a full military funeral at Arlington National Cemetery and a headstone commemorating all six airmen was placed at the site . Hambleton was unable to attend due to poor health , but a letter from him was read . He wrote , " They deserve all the accolades that we , the living , can bestow upon them . Again , I thank them , I honor them , and I will always hold great faith in my heart with them . " Clark was present . He told the families of the downed fliers that " Each of you played a distinct role and forming the character of these men who so willingly paid a very dear price to help me get out of the jungles of Vietnam . You have my deepest sympathy — you and these six brave men . " 
 Prater 's remains were buried with full military honors on June 19 , 2010 by his family . Alley had two weeks remaining on his tour of duty before returning home . He was buried with full military honors in Florida . Avery 's remains were buried with full military honors on April 6 , 2012 . Advancements in DNA testing allowed the Department of Defense POW / Missing Personnel Office to officially identify his remains and release them to his family for service at his final resting place .

 Fifteen years after the rescue , the USAF held a symposium at Nellis AFB and invited all those directly involved . John Van Etten , whose call sign was Nail 32 , had never met Gene Hambleton in person . When he stepped on stage and put out his hand to Gene , he said , " Hello , Gene , I 'm John Van Etten , " and Gene replied , " No , you 're not .... you are Nail 32 , I would recognize that voice anywhere !

 Two books were written about the search and rescue operation to bring Hambleton out alive : the first was Bat @-@ 21 ( 1985 ) by William C. Anderson , and the second , published after considerable classified information was released , The Rescue of Bat 21 ( 1999 ) by Darrel D. Whitcomb . 
 The Lt. Thomas R. Norris building at Naval Special Warfare Group Two in Little Creek , Virginia was named for Norris . 
 The film Bat * 21 , starring Gene Hackman as Hambleton , was a dramatized depiction of Hambleton 's rescue , based on some of the actual events ; Anderson assisted in the screenwriting of the film . 
 His rescue was featured in the Vietnam episode of the television series Navy Seals : Untold Stories in 2001 . 
 = French battleship Iéna = 
 Iéna was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship of the French Navy . The ship 's keel was laid in 1898 and she was completed four years later . Her design was derived from the preceding Charlemagne @-@ class battleships with a heavier secondary battery and thicker armour . She retained the tumblehome characteristic of all large French warships of this period that caused stability issues . Upon completion Iena was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron and remained there for the duration of her career . She participated in the annual fleet manoeuvers and made many visits to French ports in the Mediterranean . 
 While docked for repairs , Iéna was gutted on 12 March 1907 by a magazine explosion caused by the decomposition of well @-@ aged " Powder B " propellant . While it was possible to repair her , the ship was not thought worth the time or expense . Her hulk was used as a gunnery target before it was sold for scrap in 1912 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Iéna was designed at the request of the Board of Construction ( French : Conseil des <unk> ) to follow the Charlemagne class ships whose seakeeping qualities were not entirely satisfactory . But Constructor <unk> just modified the Charlemagne 's design with a heavier secondary battery and thicker armour , distributed in a slightly different manner . This increased her displacement by 700 tonnes ( 690 long tons ) in comparison to the older ships and she retained the pronounced tumblehome that was the cause of the stability problems . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The Iéna was longer than her predecessors , at 122 @.@ 35 metres ( 401 ft 5 in ) overall . She had a beam of 20 @.@ 83 metres ( 68 ft 4 in ) and , at deep load , a draught of 7 @.@ 45 metres ( 24 ft 5 in ) forward and 8 @.@ 45 metres ( 27 @.@ 7 ft ) aft . She was only slightly heavier than the Charlemagne class and displaced 11 @,@ 688 metric tons ( 11 @,@ 503 long tons ) normally , and 12 @,@ 105 metric tons ( 11 @,@ 910 long tons ) at full load , 700 metric tons more than the earlier ships . 
 Iéna was fitted with large bilge keels , but was reported to roll considerably and pitch heavily , although this is contradicted by the ship 's captain 's report of November 1905 : " From the sea @-@ keeping point of view the Iéna is an excellent ship . Pitching and rolling movements are gentle and the ship rides the waves well . " 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Iéna used three vertical triple expansion steam engines built by Les Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée , one engine per shaft . Each shaft drove a three @-@ bladed propeller that was 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 14 ft 9 in ) in diameter on the wing shafts and 4 @.@ 4 metres ( 14 ft 5 in ) in diameter on the center shaft . The engines were powered by twenty Belleville water @-@ tube boilers at a working pressure of 18 kg / cm2 ( 1 @,@ 765 kPa ; 256 psi ) . The engines were rated at a total of 16 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 300 kW ) and produced 16 @,@ 590 ihp ( 12 @,@ 370 kW ) during the ship 's sea trials . Iena reached a top speed of 18 @.@ 11 knots ( 33 @.@ 54 km / h ; 20 @.@ 84 mph ) on her trials . She carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 165 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 147 long tons ) of coal which allowed her to steam for 4 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 300 km ; 5 @,@ 200 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The ship 's 80 @-@ volt electrical power was provided by 600 @-@ ampere and 1200 @-@ ampere dynamos . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Like the Charlemagne class which preceded her , Iéna carried her main armament of four 305 mm ( 12 in ) , 40 @-@ calibre Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893 / 96 guns in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one each fore and aft . The guns fired 340 @-@ kilogram ( 750 lb ) projectiles at the rate of 1 round per minute at a muzzle velocity of 780 m / s ( 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ) . This gave a range of 12 @,@ 000 metres ( 13 @,@ 000 yd ) at the maximum elevation of 15 ° . The magazines stored 180 shells per gun , enough for three hours of fighting . 
 The ship 's secondary armament consisted of eight 45 @-@ calibre Canon de 164 mm Modèle 1893 guns , which were mounted in individual casemates . The guns fired 164 @.@ 7 mm ( 6 @.@ 48 in ) , 52 @-@ kilogram ( 115 lb ) shells at a muzzle velocity of 865 m / s ( 2 @,@ 840 ft / s ) to a maximum range of 9 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 yd ) . A total of 1606 rounds were carried , enough for three hours of fighting at the practical 1 – 2 rounds per minute per gun . Iéna also carried eight 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) , 45 @-@ calibre Canon de 100 mm Modèle 1893 guns in shielded mounts on the shelter deck . These guns fired a 12 @-@ kilogram ( 26 lb ) projectile at 710 m / s ( 2 @,@ 300 ft / s ) , which could be trained up to 20 ° for a maximum range of 9 @,@ 500 metres ( 10 @,@ 400 yd ) . Their theoretical maximum rate of fire was six rounds per minute , but only three rounds per minute could be sustained . 2074 shells were carried to ensure three hours of fire . The guns were 6 @.@ 26 metres ( 20 ft 6 in ) above the waterline . 
 Iena 's anti @-@ torpedo boat defences consisted of 16 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) 40 @-@ calibre Canon de 47 mm Modèle 1885 Hotchkiss guns , fitted in platforms on both masts and on the superstructure . They fired a 1 @.@ 49 @-@ kilogram ( 3 @.@ 3 lb ) projectile at 610 m / s ( 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ) to a maximum range of 4 @,@ 000 metres ( 4 @,@ 400 yd ) . Their theoretical maximum rate of fire was fifteen rounds per minute , but only seven rounds per minute sustained . 15 @,@ 000 shells were kept in the magazines . Admiral Marquis criticized the arrangements for the 47 mm guns in a 1903 report : 
 The number of ready @-@ use rounds is insufficient and the hoists are desperately slow . The 47 mm guns , much more so than the large and medium @-@ calibre guns , will have to fight at night ; yet these are the only guns without a fire @-@ control system designed for night operations . This is a deficiency which needs to be corrected as soon as possible . 
 Iena mounted four 450 @-@ millimetre ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes . Two tubes were submerged and the other two were above the waterline . Twelve Modèle 1889 torpedoes were carried , of which four were training models . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 Iéna had a complete waterline armour belt of Harvey armour that was 2 @.@ 4 metres ( 7 ft 10 in ) high and tapered from the maximum thickness of 320 mm ( 12 @.@ 6 in ) that covered 84 metres ( 275 ft 7 in ) amidships to 230 mm ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) at the ship 's ends . The lower edge of this belt was a uniform 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) in thickness . The upper armour belt was in two strakes , the lower 120 mm thick and the upper 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) . Their combined height was 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) amidships . The maximum thickness of the armoured deck was 80 mm and the fore and aft armoured transverse bulkheads were 90 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) thick . The main turret armour ranged from 278 – 318 mm ( 10 @.@ 9 – 12 @.@ 5 in ) in thickness with a 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) roof and the ammunition shafts were protected by 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) of armour . The casemates for the 164 mm guns were 90 mm thick and their ammunition tubes had 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) of armour . 
 The conning tower face had 298 mm ( 11 @.@ 7 in ) of armour and its sides were 250 mm thick . Its roof was protected by two layers of armour , each 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) thick . The communications tube was protected by 200 mm of armour .

 Iéna was laid down at Brest on 15 January 1898 after being authorized on 3 April 1897 . She was launched on 1 September 1898 , but did not enter service until 14 April 1902 . Iéna was assigned to the Second Division of the Mediterranean Squadron and sailed for Toulon five days later . En route , the ship suffered from a number of problems with her rudder and had to be docked for repairs once she arrived at her destination . After the completion of the repairs the ship began a series of port visits in France and French North Africa which would be repeated for most of her career . Iena participated in the fleet review off Naples in April – May 1904 on the occasion of the visit of the President of France with King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy . Afterwards , the Mediterranean Squadron cruised the Levant , calling in Beirut , Suda Bay , Smyrna , Mytilene , Salonika and Piraeus . In April 1906 , she was dispatched to provide assistance to Naples after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius . 
 = = = Loss = = = 
 On 4 March 1907 Iéna was moved into dry dock No. 2 in the <unk> Basin at Toulon to undergo maintenance of her hull as well as inspection of her rudder shaft . Eight days later , beginning at 1 : 35 a.m. and continuing until 2 : 45 , a series of explosions began in the port No. 5 100 @-@ millimetre magazine of the Iéna which devastated the ship and the surrounding area . Because the ship was in a dry dock it was initially impossible to flood the magazines . The commanding officer of the battleship Patrie , which was moored nearby , fired a shell into the gate of the dry dock in an attempt to flood it , but the shell ricocheted without holing the gate . The dock was finally flooded when Ensign de Vaisseau Roux ( who was killed shortly afterward by fragments from the ship ) managed to open the sluice gates . The French battleship Suffren , moored in the No. 1 dock beside the Iéna , almost capsized under the strength of the blasts . 
 The origin of the first explosion was traced to Powder B , a nitrocellulose @-@ based propellant used in the ammunition , which tended to become unstable with age , and self @-@ ignite . It was estimated that 80 % of the contents of the ship 's magazines were the suspect powder at the time of the accident . The explosion and loss of 120 lives , including two civilians killed by fragments in the suburb of Le Pont Du Las , triggered a major scandal , dubbed " the gunpowder scandal " ( French : l 'affaire des <unk> ) . As a result , Gaston Thomson , the Navy Minister , was forced to resign . A similar accident later caused the loss of the French battleship Liberté in 1911 . 
 = = = Disposal = = = 
 The multiple explosions gutted the superstructure between the mainmast and the rear funnel and collapsed the superstructure surrounding the mainmast . The ship 's side between Frames 74 and 84 was ripped open down to the lower edge of the armour belt and all the machinery in this area was destroyed . After it was estimated that it would take seven million francs and two years to fully repair the Iéna it was decided to decommission the ship and use her as a target ship . All useful equipment was removed and she was towed to a mooring off the Île des <unk> where she was used as a target to test the effectiveness of the latest design of armour @-@ piercing shells beginning on 9 August 1909 . After the completion of numerous tests , and with the Iéna close to foundering , she was towed to deeper water . While under tow Iéna capsized and sank on 2 December 1909 . The rights to the wreck were sold and she was subsequently broken up and salvaged between 1912 and 1927 . 
 = Smooth toadfish = 
 The smooth toadfish ( Tetractenos glaber ) is a species of fish in the pufferfish family <unk> . It is native to shallow coastal and estuarine waters of southeastern Australia , where it is widespread and abundant . French naturalist Christophe @-@ Paulin de La Poix de Fréminville described the species in 1813 , though early records confused it with its close relative , the common toadfish ( T. hamiltonii ) . The two are the only members of the genus Tetractenos after going through several taxonomic changes since discovery . 
 Up to 16 cm ( 6 1 ⁄ 4 in ) long with distinctive leopard @-@ like dark markings on its upperparts , it has a rounded front and tapers to a narrow tail at the back . Unlike most of its relatives , it does not have prominent spines on its body . Like other pufferfish , it can inflate itself with water or air . It forages for its preferred foods — molluscs and crustaceans — in sand and mud of the bottom sediment . Often an unwanted catch by anglers , the smooth toadfish is highly poisonous because of the tetrodotoxin present in its body , and eating it may result in death . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 French naturalist Christophe @-@ Paulin de La Poix de Fréminville described the smooth toadfish in 1813 as Tetrodon glaber , based on a specimen collected in Adventure Bay in southeastern Tasmania by Claude Riche . This holotype was then catalogued in the collection of French naturalist Alexandre Brongniart , but was subsequently lost ; upon his death , Brongniart 's collection was bequeathed to the Paris Museum and the specimen did not appear there nor at any other institution . The specific name glaber is from the Latin adjective <unk> , meaning " bald " . Fréminville 's description was overlooked by many subsequent authorities , resulting in the confusion of this species with the closely related common toadfish ( Tetractenos hamiltoni ) ; it is unclear with many records which species was being referred to , though those from Victoria and Tasmania belong to this species . This issue in the scientific literature was not fully resolved until 1983 . 
 French naturalist Auguste Duméril erected a new genus in publishing the species as <unk> reticulatus in 1855 from a description authored by his countryman Gabriel Bibron , who had died suddenly , Later Latinised to <unk> , it was linked to a presumed type species Tetrodon reticulatus , from a manuscript by Bibron . In 1959 , <unk> Le <unk> equated this species name to Tetractenos hamiltoni , but New Zealand zoologist Graham Hardy later reviewed the specimens labelled as T. hamiltoni and found that they should be assigned to T. glaber . The genus name <unk> — not <unk> , as the original spelling takes priority — would have taken precedence over the current genus name Tetractenos . However , it is a nomen nudum as it does not provide enough detail or information to diagnose or properly describe the species , since Duméril had only written a ( French ) translation of the genus name — <unk> qui <unk> <unk> pas , <unk> , <unk> ( " with no thorns " ) . 
 British ichthyologist Charles Tate Regan described <unk> <unk> in 1909 from specimens collected in Melbourne , Hobart , Flinders Island and Port Phillip . He noted its lack of spines compared with specimens of Tetrodon hamiltonii , and hence argued that it was a distinct and separate species . Australian biologist Gilbert Whitley equated Regan 's description with Fréminville 's original naming and gave it the combination <unk> glaber in 1955 , and later <unk> glaber in 1964 . 
 The smooth toadfish was assigned to the genera Tetrodon ( now <unk> ) and <unk> , both of which became wastebasket taxa . The smooth toadfish was assigned to several other genera after it became clear that it fell outside a more restricted definition of <unk> ( a ) odon , including <unk> . Recognising that the smooth and common toadfish were distinct enough from other species to warrant their own genus and that no valid genus name existed , Hardy reassigned the two species to the new genus Tetractenos in 1983 . 
 Common names include smooth toadfish , smooth <unk> , slimey toadfish or smooth <unk> . Along with related toadfish species , the smooth toadfish is known in Australia as a " <unk> " . <unk> is a Tharawal name for toadfish in the Sydney region , the word recorded by William Dawes as ca @-@ gone in his 1791 diaries of the Sydney language . 
 = = Description = = 
 With a total adult length of anywhere from 3 to 16 cm ( 1 1 ⁄ 8 – 6 1 ⁄ 4 in ) , the smooth toadfish has an elongate body with a rounded back and flattened belly . The body narrows posteriorly to the slender tail , and its fins are all elongate and rounded . The dorsal fin has 9 to 11 rays . The pectoral fin has 15 to 18 rays , the first of which is very short . It arises well below the level of the eye . The anal fin has 7 – 9 rays and caudal fin has 11 . The smooth toadfish has a small mouth with thin lips at its apex and a tiny chin . The round eyes are adnate ( unable to rotate ) , their upper border is level with the profile of the back and the lower border is well above the mouth . In a slightly depressed area just in front of the eyes are two small nipple @-@ shaped structures ( papillae ) that are the nasal organs . The openings face to the rear of the fish and are closed by flaps attached to the walls closest to the fish 's midline . The first <unk> gill arch is elongated and narrow with many tiny teeth . The smooth toadfish has tiny spines that are entirely within the skin layer ; these run along its back from the nasal organs almost to the dorsal fin , and along its sides from the eye to the pectoral fine , and along its underparts from behind its mouth to its vent . The skin is smooth even when the fish is fully inflated . It swallows water or air via a flap in its throat to swell itself up . 
 The base colour of the upperparts is pale tan to yellow @-@ green , heavily marked with irregular brown spots in a reticulated pattern , and several broad dark brown bands , including ones between the eyes , between the pectoral fins and at the level of the dorsal fin . Reminiscent of a leopard 's spots , the reticulated pattern continues on the upper lateral side along the body of the fish , becoming silver @-@ white on the lower lateral parts . The chin and belly are white . The fins have a faint yellow @-@ orange tinge , more noticeably in the tail fin . Fieldwork in Sydney waters found females to be larger and heavier than males . Smooth toadfish grow steadily larger as they grow older , with one 16 cm ( 6 1 ⁄ 4 in ) long individual calculated to be 13 years old from examination of its otoliths . Their gonads develop when they reach a total length of about 7 – 8 cm ( 2 3 ⁄ 4 – 3 1 ⁄ 8 in ) . The smooth toadfish can be distinguished from the otherwise similar common toadfish by its lack of spines and its <unk> and bolder @-@ patterned markings on its upperparts . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The smooth toadfish is found along Australia 's eastern and southeast coast , from Moreton Bay in southeastern Queensland to Port Lincoln in South Australia as well as Kangaroo Island and Tasmania . It is one of the most abundant fishes in the muddy areas of Port Philip Bay . It generally lives in shallow water less than 3 m ( 10 ft ) deep , often over mudflats in estuaries . In areas of seagrass beds , smooth toadfish are more commonly found in sand areas bordering on the seagrass patches . They are more commonly found in seagrass patches in water less than 1 @.@ 5 m ( 5 ft ) deep rather than deeper water of 3 @.@ 5 – 6 m ( 11 – 20 ft ) . A South Australian field study on <unk> and associated fauna found that the smooth toadfish was associated with larger volumes and aggregations containing green algae . 
 Although its movements are poorly known , tagging patterns indicate that the smooth toadfish spends most of its life cycle and reproduces in estuaries . It can venture well into freshwater past brackish areas . In 1964 a school of toadfish were found in the Lang Lang River at the South Gippsland Highway — 34 km ( 21 mi ) from Western Port Bay and well beyond tidal areas . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 Its large range , abundance and stable population mean the smooth toadfish is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List . Although no decline in numbers has been recorded , the effects of disappearance of its habitat — mangroves and seagrass beds — is unknown . 
 = = Breeding = = 
 The breeding habits of estuary @-@ dwelling pufferfish have been little researched in general . Fieldwork in the Hawkesbury River and tributaries north of Sydney found that the smooth toadfish breeds between April and July , building up fat stores in its liver from February to April beforehand . 
 = = Feeding = = 
 The smooth toadfish has strong jaws that readily crush shellfish and crustaceans . It feeds predominantly on benthic ( bottom @-@ dwelling ) organisms in the substrate of the bodies of water in which it forages . Its diet includes molluscs such as black mussels , <unk> , white sunset shells ( <unk> alba ) and oysters ( Crassostrea ) , crustaceans such as semaphore crabs and shrimp , and brown algae . The proportions of crustaceans to molluscs can vary widely depending on the abundance of food items ; hence in a 1999 field study , the soldier crab ( <unk> <unk> ) predominated in Cowan Creek while the black mussel did so in nearby <unk> Creek . Field experiments showed it was a consumer of oysters and the gastropod <unk> <unk> , and had a major impact on their numbers . 
 Because it is a common estuarine fish , it has been used in studies of heavy metal contamination in coastal waters . Fish tested around Sydney showed uptake was highest in the gonads , then muscle , gills and liver . It is unclear why metal concentrations were lower in toadfish livers ( compared with studies of contamination in other fish ) but their liver cells may be more effective at removing these elements . Lead , cadmium and nickel levels corresponded with those in the sediment from which the fish were taken , suggesting dietary intake . The gonads of male fish had twenty times as much arsenic as those of females , while the gills of female fish contained thirty times as much lead as those of males . Raised levels of arsenic , cobalt , cadmium and lead in gills suggested the fish absorbed these from the surrounding water . An experiment exposing smooth toadfish to radioactive cadmium and selenium in either food or water found that cadmium in food was taken up in and excreted by the liver , while cadmium in water was taken up in the gut lining and excreted in liver , gills and kidney , indicating the fish were consuming a lot of water . Selenium was taken up in the gills , kidneys and liver regardless of whether it was in food or water . Fieldwork in Sydney waterways showed that higher arsenic , lead , cadmium and cobalt corresponded with decreased lipid levels in liver and gonadal tissue , and raised cobalt and nickel correspond to increased protein levels in muscle , liver and gonadal tissue . Raised lead levels were consistent with smaller egg size . A study of asymmetry of fish bones in smooth toadfish in various parts of Sydney and Hawkesbury River estuaries showed a relationship between exposure to organochlorine pesticides but not heavy metals , indicating the finding may correlate to stress from organic toxicity . 
 = = Toxicity = = 
 Notorious for taking bait from fish hooks , the smooth toadfish is an unwanted catch for anglers as its flesh is highly poisonous and unfit for human consumption . Its lack of spines makes it easier to handle than other toadfish when it inflates itself after being caught . Its toxicity had been reported by local aborigines in Sydney to William Dawes in the late 18th century . A man named John Buff was fatally poisoned after catching and eating toadfish in Duck River in 1821 near Parramatta ; his case and subsequent coroner 's inquest were published in the Sydney Gazette . The smooth toadfish was responsible for the deaths of the wife and two children of Captain Bell of New Town near Hobart in a widely publicised case in March 1831 . Colonial surgeon James Scott wrote , 
 " The melancholy and dreadful effect produced by eating it was lately instanced in the neighbourhood of Hobart town ... The poison is of a powerful sedative nature , producing stupor , loss of speech , <unk> , vision and the power of the voluntary muscles , and ultimately an entire deprivation of nervous power and death . " 
 An inquest into the deaths took place on 29 March 1831 . The family 's three servants , one of whom appeared to have been poisoned as well and was ill , were placed in custody separately to stop them communicating with each other while the investigation proceeded . The jury replicated the effects by feeding the fish to ( and poisoning ) two cats . The jury learnt that the servant , Speed , had caught the 20 or so fish and taken them home to eat . A neighbour called out to him not to eat the fish as they were " no good " , but he took it as a joke . The inquest concluded with a finding of accidental death , with some deliberation over whether Speed should have been charged with manslaughter or even murder after hearing the warning . Warnings about toadfish were subsequently issued . 
 Its toxicity is due to tetrodotoxin , which is concentrated particularly in the liver , ovaries , intestines and skin . Many species of pufferfish bear this toxin , obtaining it from tetrodotoxin @-@ containing bacteria in their diet . Eating the fish can have fatal consequences . The symptoms of poisoning , which are predominantly neurological , include ataxia , in addition to numbness and / or <unk> ( tingling ) around the mouth , lips , and limb extremities . Cases of pets being poisoned have occurred when the fish have been left where they can eat them . 
 = History of Lima = 
 The history of Lima , the capital of Peru , began with its foundation by Francisco Pizarro on January 18 , 1535 . The city was established on the valley of the Rímac River in an area populated by the <unk> polity . It became the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru and site of a Real Audiencia in 1543 . In the 17th century , the city prospered as the center of an extensive trade network despite damage from earthquakes and the threat of pirates . However , prosperity came to an end in the 18th century due to an economic downturn and the Bourbon Reforms . 
 The population of Lima played an ambivalent role in the 1821 – 1824 Peruvian War of Independence ; the city suffered exactions from Royalist and Patriot armies alike . After independence , Lima became the capital of the Republic of Peru . It enjoyed a short period of prosperity in the mid @-@ 19th century until the 1879 – 1883 War of the Pacific when it was occupied and looted by Chilean troops . After the war , the city went through a period of demographic expansion and urban renewal . Population growth accelerated in the 1940s spurred by immigration from the Andean regions of Peru . This gave rise to the proliferation of shanty towns as public services failed to keep up with the city expansion . 
 = = Foundation = = 
 In the pre @-@ Columbian era , the location of what is now the city of Lima was inhabited by several Amerindian groups . Prior to the arrival of the Inca Empire , the valleys of the Rímac and <unk> rivers were grouped under the <unk> polity . Their presence left a mark in the form of some 40 pyramids associated to the irrigation system of the valleys . 
 In 1532 , a group of Spanish conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro defeated the Inca ruler Atahualpa and searched for a suitable place to establish his capital . His first choice was the city of <unk> , located amid the Andes , however this location was regarded as inconvenient for its high altitude and being far from the sea . Spanish scouts reported about a better site in the valley of the Rímac , which was close to the Pacific Ocean , had ample water and wood provisions , extensive fields and fair weather . Pizarro thus founded the city of Lima in Peru 's central coast on 18 January 1535 . Carlos Huerta writes in his Chronology of the conquest of the kingdoms of Peru - <unk> de la conquista de los <unk> del Perú : 
 Foundation of Lima . The city capital of Peru was founded on 18 January and was called Ciudad de los Reyes ( City of Kings ) in honor of the feast of the holy kings who was celebrated . Began in the church , the foundation and the plane of the city , where Pizarro put the first stone . 
 In August 1536 , the new city was besieged by the troops of Manco Inca , the leader of an Inca rebellion against Spanish rule . The Spaniards and their native allies , headed by Pizarro himself , defeated the rebels after heavy fighting in the city streets and its surroundings . On November 3 , 1536 , the Spanish Crown confirmed the founding and , on December 7 , 1537 , emperor Charles V granted a coat of arms to the city . 
 = = Colonial period = = 
 Over the next few years , Lima shared the turmoil caused by struggles between different factions of Spaniards . At the same time it gained prestige as it was designated capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru and site of a Real Audiencia in 1543 . Latin America and Lima 's first university , the National University of San Marcos was established in 1551 and its first printing press in 1584 . Lima also became an important religious center , a Roman Catholic diocese was established in 1541 and converted to an archdiocese five years later . In 1609 , the city held celebrations for the beatification of Ignatius of Loyola . 
 Lima flourished during the 17th century as the center of an extensive trade network which integrated the Viceroyalty of Peru with the Americas , Europe and the Far East . Its merchants channeled Peruvian silver through the nearby port of Callao and exchanged it for imported goods at the trade fair of Portobelo in modern @-@ day Panama . This practice was sanctioned by law as all trade from the Viceroyalty was required to go through Callao on its way to and from overseas markets . The resulting economic prosperity of the city was reflected in its rapid growth , population expanded from about 25 @,@ 000 in 1619 to an estimated 80 @,@ 000 in 1687 . 
 However , Lima was not free from dangers . On October 20 and December 2 , 1687 , powerful earthquakes destroyed most of the city and its surroundings . The outbreaks of disease and food shortages which followed the disaster caused a reduction of the population to under 40 @,@ 000 by 1692 . A second threat was the presence of pirates and privateers in the Pacific Ocean . A Dutch naval expedition led by Jacques l 'Hermite attacked the port of Callao in 1624 but was repelled by Viceroy Diego Fernández de Córdoba . In the 1680s , English buccaneers proliferated in the waters of the Pacific until they were routed by Lima merchants in 1690 . As a precautionary measure , Viceroy Melchor de Navarra y <unk> built the Lima City Walls between 1684 and 1687 . 
 The 1687 earthquake marked a turning point in the history of Lima as it coincided with a recession in trade , a reduction of silver production and economic competition by other cities such as Buenos Aires . To add to these problems , on October 28 , 1746 , a powerful earthquake severely damaged the city and destroyed Callao , forcing a massive rebuilding effort under Viceroy José Antonio Manso de Velasco . This disaster led to an intense devotion for an image of Christ called The Lord of the Miracles , which has been taken out in procession every October since 1746 . 
 During the late colonial period , under the rule of the House of Bourbon , the ideas of the Enlightenment on public health and social control shaped the development of Lima . New buildings undertaken during this period include a cockfighting coliseum and a bullring , the Plaza de toros de Acho , as well as the General Cemetery . The first two were built to regulate these popular activities by centralizing them at a single venue , while the cemetery put an end to the practice of burials at churches which was considered unhealthy by public authorities . 
 = = Independence = = 
 During the second half of the 18th century , Lima was adversely affected by the Bourbon Reforms as it lost its monopoly on overseas trade and the important mining region of Upper Peru was transferred to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata . This economic decline made the city 's elite dependent on royal and ecclesiastical appointment and thus , reluctant to advocate independence . In the 1810s , the city became a Royalist stronghold during the South American wars of independence led by a strong viceroy , José Fernando de <unk> y Sousa . 
 A combined expedition of Argentinian and Chilean patriots under General José de San Martín managed to land south of Lima on September 7 , 1820 but did not attack the city . Faced with a naval blockade and the action of guerrillas on land , Viceroy José de la Serna was forced to evacuate the city in July 1821 to save the Royalist army . Fearing a popular uprising and lacking any means to impose order , the city council invited San Martín to enter Lima and signed a Declaration of Independence at his request . However , the war was not over ; in the next two years the city changed hands several times and suffered exactions from both sides . By the time the war was decided , at the Battle of Ayacucho on December 9 , 1824 , Lima was considerably impoverished . 
 = = Republican period = = 
 After the war of independence , Lima became the capital of the Republic of Peru but economic stagnation and political turmoil brought its urban development to a halt . This hiatus ended in the 1850s , when increased public and private revenues from guano exports led to a rapid expansion of the city . In the next two decades , the State funded the construction of large size public buildings to replace colonial establishments ; these included the Central Market , the General Slaughterhouse , the Mental Asylum , the Penitentiary , and the Dos de Mayo Hospital . There were also improvements in communications ; a railroad line between Lima and Callao was completed in 1850 and an iron bridge across the Rímac River , the Balta Bridge , was opened in 1870 . The city walls were torn down in 1872 as further urban growth was expected . However , the export @-@ led economic expansion also widened the gap between rich and poor , fostering social unrest . 
 During the 1879 – 1883 War of the Pacific , Chilean troops occupied Lima after defeating Peruvian resistance in the battles of San Juan and Miraflores . The city suffered the depredations of the invaders , which looted public museums , libraries and educational institutions . At the same time , angry mobs attacked wealthy citizens and the Asian population ; sacking their properties and businesses . 
 After the war , the city underwent a process of urban renewal and expansion from the 1890s up to the 1920s . As downtown Lima had become overcrowded , the La Victoria residential area was established in 1896 as a working @-@ class neighborhood . During this period the urban layout was modified by the construction of big avenues which crisscrossed the city and connected it with neighboring towns such as Miraflores . In the 1920s and 1930s , several buildings of the historic centre were rebuilt including the Government Palace and the Municipal Palace . 
 On May 24 , 1940 , an earthquake hit the city , which at that time was mostly built out of adobe and <unk> . In the 1940s , Lima started a period of rapid growth spurred by immigration from the Andean regions of Peru . Population , estimated at 0 @.@ 6 million in 1940 , reached 1.9M by 1960 and <unk> by 1980 . At the start of this period , the urban area was confined to a triangular area bounded by the city 's historic center , Callao and Chorrillos ; in the following decades settlements spread to the north , beyond the Rímac River , to the east , along the Central Highway , and to the south . Immigrants , at first confined to slums in downtown Lima , led this expansion through large @-@ scale land invasions which gave rise to the proliferation of shanty towns , known as <unk> , renamed as pueblos <unk> in the 1980s and latter called " Human Settlements " during the 1990s . Major public works were carried out throughout this period , mainly under the governments of Manuel A. Odría ( 1948 – 1956 ) and Juan Velasco Alvarado ( 1968 – 1975 ) . Brutalism dominated in the 1970s as exemplified in the massive headquarters built for <unk> , the state @-@ owned petroleum company . According to the 1993 census , the city population had reached <unk> ; 28 @.@ 4 % of the total population of Peru compared to just 9 @.@ 4 % in 1940 . 
 = Psychodrama = 
 Psychodrama is an action method , often used as a psychotherapy , in which clients use spontaneous dramatization , role playing and dramatic self @-@ presentation to investigate and gain insight into their lives . Developed by Jacob L. Moreno , M.D. ( 1889 – 1974 ) psychodrama includes elements of theater , often conducted on a stage , or a space that serves as a stage area , where props can be used . A psychodrama therapy group , under the direction of a licensed <unk> , reenacts real @-@ life , past situations ( or inner mental processes ) , acting them out in present time . Participants then have the opportunity to evaluate their behavior , reflect on how the past incident is getting played out in the present and more deeply understand particular situations in their lives . Psychodrama offers a creative way for an individual or group to explore and solve personal problems . It may be used in a variety of clinical and community @-@ based settings , and is most often utilized in a group setting , in which the members of the group serve as therapeutic agents for one another in the enacted drama . Psychodrama is not , however , a form of group therapy , and is instead an individual psychotherapy that is executed from within a group . There are " side @-@ benefits " that the other group members may experience , as they make relevant connections and insights to their own lives from the psychodrama of another . A psychodrama is best conducted and produced by a person trained in the method , called a psychodrama director . 
 In a session of psychodrama , one client of the group becomes the protagonist , and focuses on a particular , personal , emotionally problematic situation to enact on stage . A variety of scenes may be enacted , depicting , for example , memories of specific happenings in the client 's past , unfinished situations , inner dramas , fantasies , dreams , preparations for future risk @-@ taking situations , or unrehearsed expressions of mental states in the here and now . These scenes either approximate real @-@ life situations or are <unk> of inner mental processes . Other members of the group may become auxiliaries , and support the protagonist by playing other significant roles in the scene or may step in , as a " double " who plays the role of the protagonist . 
 A core tenet of psychodrama is Moreno 's theory of " spontaneity @-@ creativity " . Moreno believed that the best way for an individual to respond creatively to a situation is through spontaneity , that is , through a readiness to improvise and respond in the moment . By encouraging an individual to address a problem in a creative way , reacting spontaneously and based on impulse , they may begin to discover new solutions to problems in their lives and learn new roles they can inhabit within it . Moreno 's focus on spontaneous action within the psychodrama was developed in his Theatre of Spontaneity , which he directed in Vienna in the early 1920s . Disenchanted with the stagnancy he observed in conventional , scripted theatre , he found himself interested in the spontaneity required in improvisational work . He founded an improvisational troupe in the 1920s . This work in the theatre impacted the development of his psychodramatic theory . 
 = = Methods = = 
 In psychodrama , participants explore internal conflicts by acting out their emotions and interpersonal interactions on stage . A psychodrama session ( typically 90 minutes to 2 hours ) focuses principally on a single participant , known as the protagonist . Protagonists examine their relationships by interacting with the other actors and the leader , known as the director . This is done using specific techniques , including mirroring , doubling , soliloquy , and role reversal . The session is often broken up into three phases - the warm @-@ up , the action , and the post @-@ discussion . 
 During a typical psychodrama session , a number of clients gather together . One of these clients is chosen by the group as the protagonist , and the director calls on the other clients to assist the protagonist 's " performance , " either by portraying other characters , or by utilizing mirroring , doubling , or role reversal . The clients act out a number of scenes in order to allow the protagonist to work through certain scenarios . This is obviously beneficial for the protagonist , but also is helpful to the other group members , allowing them to assume the role of another person and apply that experience to their own life . The focus during the session is on the acting out of different scenarios , rather than simply talking through them . All of the different elements of the session ( stage , props , lighting , etc . ) are used to heighten the reality of the scene . 
 The three sections of a typical session are the warm @-@ up , the action , and the sharing . During the warm @-@ up , the actors are encouraged to enter into a state of mind where they can be present in and aware of the current moment and are free to be creative . This is done through the use of different ice @-@ breaker games and activities . Next , the action section of the psychodrama session is the time in which the actual scenes themselves take place . Finally , in the post @-@ discussion , the different actors are able to comment on the action , coming from their personal point of view , not as a critique , sharing their empathy and experiences with the protagonist of the scene . 
 The following are core psychodramatic techniques : 
 Mirroring : The protagonist is first asked to act out an experience . After this , the client steps out of the scene and watch as another actor steps into their role and portrays them in the scene . 
 Doubling : The job of the “ double ” is to make conscious any thoughts or feelings that another person is unable to express whether it is because of shyness , guilt , inhibition , politeness , fear , anger , etc … . In many cases the person is unaware of these thoughts or at least is unable to form the words to express how they are feeling . Therefore the “ Double ” attempts to make conscious and give form to the unconscious and / or under expressed material . The person being doubled has the full right to disown any of the “ Double ’ s ” statements and to correct them as necessary . In this way , doubling itself can never be wrong . 
 Role playing : The client portrays a person or object that is problematic to him or her . 
 Soliloquy : The client speaks his or her thoughts aloud in order to build self @-@ knowledge . 
 Role reversal : The client is asked to portray another person while a second actor portrays the client in the particular scene . This not only prompts the client to think as the other person , but also has some of the benefits of mirroring , as the client sees him- or herself as portrayed by the second actor . 
 = = Psychological applications = = 
 Psychodrama can be used in both non @-@ clinical and clinical arenas . In the non @-@ clinical field , psychodrama is used in business , education , and professional training . In the clinical field , psychodrama may be used to alleviate the effects of emotional trauma and PTSD . One specific application in clinical situations is for people suffering from dysfunctional attachments . For this reason , it is often utilized in the treatment of children who have suffered emotional trauma and abuse . Using role @-@ play and story telling , children may be able to express themselves emotionally and reveal truths about their experience they are not able to openly discuss with their therapist , and rehearse new ways of behavior . Moreno 's theory of child development offers further insight into psychodrama and children . Moreno suggested that child development is divided into three stages : finding personal identity , recognizing oneself [ the mirror stage ) , and recognizing the other person ( the role @-@ reversal stage ) . Mirroring , role @-@ playing and other psychodramatic techniques are based on these stages . Moreno believed that psychodrama could be used to help individuals continue their emotional development through the use of these techniques . 
 = = Related concepts = = 
 Moreno 's term sociometry is often used in relation to psychodrama . By definition , sociometry is the study of social relations between individuals — interpersonal relationships . It is , more broadly , a set of ideas and practices that are focused on promoting spontaneity in human relations . Classically , sociometry involves techniques for identifying , organizing , and giving feedback on specific interpersonal preferences an individual has . For example , in a psychodrama session , allowing the group to decide whom the protagonist shall be employs sociometry . 
 Moreno is also credited for founding sociodrama . Though sociodrama , like psychodrama , utilizes the theatrical form as means of therapy , the terms are not synonymous . While psychodrama focuses on one patient within the group unit , <unk> addresses the group as a whole . The goal is to explore social events , collective ideologies , and community patterns within a group in order to bring about positive change or transformation within the group dynamic . Moreno also believed that sociodrama could be used as a form of micro @-@ sociology — that by examining the dynamic of a small group of individuals , patterns could be discovered that manifest themselves within the society as a whole , such as in Alcoholics Anonymous . <unk> can be divided into three main categories : crisis sociodrama , which deals with group responses after a catastrophic event , political sociodrama , which attempts to address stratification and inequality issues within a society , and diversity sociodrama , which considers conflicts based on prejudice , racism or stigmatization . 
 = = History = = 
 Dr. J. L. Moreno ( 1889 – 1974 ) is the founder of psychodrama and sociometry , and one of the forerunners of the group psychotherapy movement . Around 1910 , he developed the Theater of Spontaneity , which is based on the acting out of improvisational impulses . The focus of this exercise was not originally on the therapeutic effects of psychodrama ; these were seen by Moreno to simply be positive side @-@ effects . 
 A poem by Moreno reveals ideas central to the practice of psychodrama , and describes the purpose of mirroring : 
 " A meeting of two : eye to eye , face to face . 
 And when you are near I will tear your eyes out 
 and place them instead of mine , 
 and you will tear my eyes out 
 and will place them instead of yours , 
 then I will look at me with mine . " 
 In 1912 , Moreno attended one of Sigmund Freud 's lectures . In his autobiography , he recalled the experience : " As the students filed out , he singled me out from the crowd and asked me what I was doing . I responded , ' Well , Dr. Freud , I start where you leave off . You meet people in the artificial setting of your office . I meet them on the street and in their homes , in their natural surroundings . You analyze their dreams . I give them the courage to dream again . You analyze and tear them apart . I let them act out their conflicting roles and help them to put the parts back together again . ' " 
 While a student at the University of Vienna in 1917 , Moreno gathered a group of prostitutes as a way of discussing the social stigma and other problems they faced , starting what might be called the first " support group " . From experiences like that , and as inspired by psychoanalysts such as Wilhelm Reich and Freud , Moreno began to develop psychodrama . After moving to the United States in 1925 , Moreno introduced his work with psychodrama to American psychologists . He began this work with children , and then eventually moved on to large group psychodrama sessions that he held at Impromptu Group Theatre at Carnegie Hall . These sessions established Moreno 's name , not only in psychological circles , but also among non @-@ psychologists . Moreno continued to teach his method of psychodrama , leading sessions until his death in 1974 . 
 Another important practitioner in the field of psychodrama is Carl Hollander . Hollander was the 37th director certified by Moreno in psychodrama . He is known primarily for his creation of the Hollander Psychodrama Curve , which may be utilized as a way to understand how a psychodrama session is structured . Hollander uses the image of a curve to explain the three parts of a psychodrama session : the warm @-@ up , the activity , and the integration . The warm @-@ up exists to put patients into a place of spontaneity and creativity in order to be open in the act of psychodrama . The " activity " is the actual enactment of the psychodrama process . Finally , the " curve " moves to integration . It serves as closure and discussion of the session , and considers how the session can be brought into real life – a sort of debriefing . 
 Although psychodrama is not widely practiced , the work done by practitioners of psychodrama has opened the doors to research possibilities for other psychological concepts such as group therapy and expansion of the work of Sigmund Freud . The growing field of drama therapy utilizes psychodrama as one of its main elements . The methods of psychodrama are also used by group therapy organizations and also find a place in other types of therapy , such as post @-@ divorce counseling for children .

 Holy Wood ( In the Shadow of the Valley of Death ) is the fourth studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson , released in November 2000 by Nothing and Interscope Records . The album marked a return to the industrial and alternative metal styles of the band 's earlier efforts , after the modernized glam rock of Mechanical Animals . As their first release following the Columbine High School massacre of April 20 , 1999 , Holy Wood was Marilyn Manson 's rebuttal to accusations leveled against them in the wake of the shootings . The band 's frontman , Marilyn Manson , described the record as " a declaration of war " . 
 A rock opera concept album , it is the final installment in a trilogy which includes Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals . After its release , Manson said that the overarching story within the trilogy is presented in reverse chronological order ; Holy Wood , therefore , begins the narrative . It was written in the singer 's former home in the Hollywood Hills and recorded in several undisclosed locations , including Death Valley and Laurel Canyon . 
 At its release , Holy Wood received mixed @-@ to @-@ positive reviews ; many critics noted that while ambitious , it fell short in execution . The album was not at first as commercially successful as the group 's two previous releases , and took three years to receive a gold certification from the RIAA . Nevertheless , with worldwide sales of over nine million copies as of 2011 , it has become one of the most successful of their career . It spawned three singles and an abandoned film project which was modified into the as @-@ yet @-@ unreleased Holy Wood novel . Marilyn Manson supported the album with the controversial Guns , God and Government Tour . 
 On November 10 , 2010 , British rock magazine Kerrang ! published a 10th @-@ anniversary commemorative piece in which they called the album " Manson 's finest hour ... A decade on , there has still not been as eloquent and savage a musical attack on the media and mainstream culture ... [ It is ] still scathingly relevant [ and ] a credit to a man who refused to sit and take it , but instead come out swinging . " 
 = = Background and development = = 
 In the late 1990s Marilyn Manson and his eponymous band established themselves as a household name as one of the most controversial rock acts in music history through the commercial success of their albums , Antichrist Superstar ( 1996 ) and Mechanical Animals ( 1998 ) . By the time of their Rock Is Dead Tour in 1999 , the band 's outspoken frontman had become a culture war iconoclast and a rallying icon for alienated youth . 
 As their popularity increased the transgressive , confrontational nature of the group 's music and imagery angered social conservatives . Politicians across the political spectrum lobbied to have their performances banned , citing rumors that the shows contained animal sacrifices , bestiality and rape . Their concerts were routinely picketed by religious advocates and parent groups , who asserted that their music had a corrupting influence on youth culture by inciting " rape , murder , blasphemy and suicide " . 
 On April 20 , 1999 , Columbine High School students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold shot 12 students and a teacher to death , wounding 21 others before committing suicide . In the aftermath of the fourth @-@ deadliest school shooting in United States history , the band became a scapegoat . Early media reports alleged that the shooters were fans of the band and wore the group 's t @-@ shirts during the massacre . Speculation in national media and among the public blamed Manson 's music and imagery for inciting Harris and Klebold . Later reports revealed that the two considered the band " a joke " . Despite this , the group ( and other bands and popular entertainment , such as movies and video games ) were widely criticized by religious , political and entertainment @-@ industry figures . 
 Under mounting pressure in the days after Columbine , the group postponed their last five North American tour dates out of respect for the victims and their families . On April 29 ten US senators ( led by Sam Brownback of Kansas ) sent a letter to Edgar Bronfman Jr . , president of <unk> ( which owned Interscope Records ) , requesting a voluntary halt to his company 's distribution to children of " music that glorifies violence " . The letter named Marilyn Manson ( and other bands ) for producing songs which " eerily reflect " the actions of Harris and Klebold . Later that day , the band canceled their remaining North American shows . On May 1 Manson published a Rolling Stone op @-@ ed response to the accusations , " Columbine : Whose Fault Is It ? " In it , he wrote : 
 I chose not to jump into the media frenzy and defend myself , though I was begged to be on every single TV show in existence . I didn 't want to contribute to these fame @-@ seeking journalists and opportunists looking to fill their churches or to get elected [ during the US general election of 2000 ] because of their self @-@ righteous finger @-@ pointing . They want to blame entertainment ? Isn 't religion the first real entertainment ? People dress up in costumes , sing songs and dedicate themselves to eternal fandom ... I 'd like [ the ] media commentators to ask themselves , because their coverage of [ Columbine ] was some of the most gruesome entertainment any of us have seen . 
 On May 4 , a hearing on the marketing and distribution of violent content to minors by the television , music , film and video @-@ game industries was held by the United States Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation . The committee heard testimony from " cultural observers " ( such as William Bennett and the Archbishop of Denver , Charles J. Chaput ) , professors and mental @-@ health professionals . Speakers criticized the band , its label @-@ mate Nine Inch Nails and the 1999 film The Matrix for their alleged contribution to a cultural environment enabling violence such as the Columbine shootings . The committee requested that the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice investigate the entertainment industry 's marketing practices to minors . 
 Concluding the European and Japanese legs of their tour on August 8 , 1999 , the band withdrew from public view . The album 's early development coincided with Manson 's three @-@ month seclusion at his home in the Hollywood Hills , during which he considered how to respond to the accusations . Manson said the maelstrom made him reevaluate his career : " [ t ] here was a bit of trepidation , [ in ] deciding , ' Is it worth it ? Are people understanding what I 'm trying to say ? Am I even gonna be allowed to say it ? ' Because I definitely had every single door shut in my face ... there were not a lot of people who stood behind me . " He told Alternative Press he felt his safety was threatened to the point that he " could be shot Mark David Chapman @-@ style " . Manson concluded that it was unwise for a controversial artist to allow his detractors to scapegoat his work ( and popular entertainment in general ) , beginning work on the album as a counterattack . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 Manson began writing for the album in 1995 , before the release of Antichrist Superstar ; the material initially consisted of scattered ideas . Isolating himself in his attic , he worked the early material into a usable shape . At the end of Manson 's three @-@ month retreat , the band embarked on a year of writing and developing the material . Band members maintained a low profile , and Manson said the band 's website would " be my only contact with humanity " . 
 The album is the group 's most collaborative effort to date , with all members contributing to the songwriting process ( resulting in a more @-@ unified sound ) . Most of the work was shouldered by Twiggy Ramirez , John 5 and Marilyn Manson ; keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy provided input on " President Dead " and " Cruci @-@ Fiction in Space " , and Ginger Fish did the drum work . Manson said that his songwriting sessions with John 5 were very focused ; most of the songs were complete before being brought to the band for consideration , and were enthusiastically received . In contrast , his sessions with Ramirez were less demanding as they experimented with absinthe . The band wrote 100 musical fragments ; between 25 and 30 became songs , and 19 were selected for the album . 
 The album was recorded at several locations , including Death Valley and Rick Rubin 's Mansion Studio in Laurel Canyon . Locations were chosen for the atmosphere they were intended to impart to the music . Mixing engineer Dave Sardy co @-@ produced the album with Manson ; Bon Harris , of electronic body music group Nitzer Ebb , did the programming and pre @-@ production editing . Manson announced on December 16 , 1999 that the album was progressing under a working title of " In the Shadow of the Valley of Death " , with its logo the alchemical symbol for mercury . 
 The band visited Death Valley a number of times to " imprint the feeling of the desert into [ their ] minds " and avoid composing artificial @-@ sounding songs . Experimental recordings and acoustic songs were recorded with live instrumentation . Manson later explained that the acoustic songs were " acoustic " in that they were not produced electrically ; the album 's sonic landscape is intrinsically electronic . Harris ' programming skills proved invaluable as the band recorded unique , natural sounds , which he molded into aural elements . 
 The band spent considerable time at the Mansion Studio , with its cavernous rooms suitable for recording drums . Inspired by the space , the band found they could accomplish more there than in the limited environment of Manson 's home studio . Ramirez later had a fuzzy memory of the sessions , explaining that there were " a lot of different emotions racing around [ us ] " ; the house , which once belonged to Harry Houdini , is said to be haunted . Gacy said that he spent most of his time working on a computer and synthesizer , " mess [ ing ] around with prime @-@ number loops where they only intersect every three days and I 'd check up on what kind of music they 'd be making . You never know what 's going to happen " . Fish worked constantly , and the bulk of his contributions to the recording process were made at the Mansion . 
 On February 23 , 2000 Manson delivered a 20 @-@ minute lecture via satellite to a current @-@ events convention , " <unk> 2000 " , aimed at exposing ( and dispelling ) disinformation . Six days later , their album was entitled Holy Wood ( In the Shadow of the Valley of Death ) . By April 12 the band was in their final stages of recording , and Manson posted footage of the recording studio . In pre @-@ release interviews , he noted that the record would be " a very sharp pencil " which would appeal to Marilyn Manson fans . 
 = = = Novel and film = = = 
 Manson 's ambitions for the project initially included an eponymous film exploring the album 's backstory . In July 1999 , he had reportedly begun negotiating with New Line Cinema to produce and distribute the film and its soundtrack . At the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards in Dublin ( where the band performed on November 11 ) , he disclosed the film 's title and his production plans . Manson met Chilean avant @-@ garde filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky at the event to discuss work on the film , although no final decision was made . By February 29 , 2000 the deal fell through when Manson had reservations that New Line Cinema would take the film in a direction which would not have " retained his artistic vision " . 
 Abandoning his attempt to bring Holy Wood to the screen , Manson announced plans to publish two books accompanying the album . The first was a " graphic and <unk> " novelization , intended for release shortly after the album by <unk> ( a division of HarperCollins ) . The novel 's style was inspired by William S. Burroughs , Kurt Vonnegut , Aldous Huxley and Philip K. Dick , and it would be followed by a coffee table book of images created for the project . 
 In a December 2000 interview with Manson , novelist Chuck Palahniuk mentioned the Holy Wood novel ( due for release in spring 2001 ) and complimented its style . Neither book has yet been released , reportedly due to a publishing dispute .

 The album 's plot is a " parable " in a thinly @-@ veiled satire of modern America called " Holy Wood " , which Manson has described as a city @-@ sized , Disneyesque amusement park where the main attractions are violence and sex . Its literary foil is " Death Valley " , " a metaphor for the outcast and the imperfect of the world . " 
 The central character is the ill @-@ fated protagonist " Adam Kadmon " , a name borrowed from the Kabbalah which means " primal man " . In the similarly @-@ mystical Sufi and Alevi philosophies , he is an archetypical " perfect " or " complete man " . Adam Kadmon travels from Death Valley to Holy Wood ; idealistic and naïve , he attempts a revolution through music . 
 Disenchanted when his revolution is consumed by Holy Wood 's ideology of " guns , God and government " , he is absorbed by its culture of death and fame in which celebrity worship , violence and scapegoating are the moral values of a religion rooted in martyrdom . In this religion dead celebrities are revered as saints , and John F. Kennedy is idolized as a modern Christ . 
 Known as " <unk> " , Holy Wood 's religion parallels Christianity . It critiques the dead @-@ celebrity phenomenon in American culture , with the crucifixion of Jesus as its blueprint . This concept extended to the world Guns , God and Government Tour supporting the album ; the tour 's logo was a rifle , with handguns arranged to resemble the Christian cross . 
 Manson told Rolling Stone that the plot is semi @-@ autobiographical . While it can be viewed on several levels , he said that the simplest interpretation is to see it as a story of an angry youth whose revolution is commercialized , leading him to " destroy the thing he has created , which is himself . " 
 = = = Themes = = = 
 Violence is the central theme of the album , which takes a critical look at America 's obsession with firearms , death and fame and their ramifications in the Columbine tragedy . Manson sees the root causes of Columbine as the gun culture , conservative American Christianity and traditional family values . The album illustrates the harmful roles they play in the glorification ( and acceptance ) of violence in " mainstream " culture , illustrated by the slogan " Guns , God and Government " . Drawing similarities between the Cold War period of 1960s America and the 1990s , Manson uses allegories from the former decade and other events and figures in cultural history . Music journalist Charlotte Robinson said that it is difficult to assess the " narrative 's effectiveness " without the book and film : " the album doesn 't tell much of a story , instead presenting variations on the same themes " . 
 Manson was drawn to The Beatles ' White Album because of its role in the Charles Manson " Family " murders and the parallels he saw between that crime and Columbine : " [ It ] had a lot of very subversive messages on it . Ones they intended and ones that may 've [ sic ] been misinterpreted by [ convicted mass murder conspirator ] Charles Manson " . Manson believes it was the first piece of music blamed for inciting violence : " When you 've got ' Helter Skelter ' [ taken from a Beatles song of the same name ] written in blood on someone 's wall , it 's a little more damning than anything I 've been blamed for " . Manson appreciates the record 's power , which inspired his album 's concept . Holy Wood , he said , " is a tribute to what that record did in history . " 
 Critics also noted similarities between anti @-@ hero Adam Kadmon and Charles Manson . Manson echoed this assessment , describing Holy Wood as a declaration of war on the entertainment industry : " their self @-@ congratulatory attitude , their beliefs that they can never do wrong , ... that they 're the center of the universe ... [ i ] n one way it 's defending Hollywood , and in another way it 's attacking it for not being brave enough " . 
 A substantial portion of the album analyzes the cultural role of Jesus Christ and the iconography of his crucifixion as the origin of celebrity , appraising " our relationship with Christ , and how we outgrew that " . Manson says that while in the past he critiqued religion , with this album he accepts the story and looks for things to which he can relate . He discovered that Christ was a revolutionary figure — a person who was killed for having dangerous opinions , and was later exploited and merchandised by Christianity . Manson notes the irony of " religious people who indict entertainment as being violent " ; the crucifixion is an icon of violence which made Jesus " the first rock star " . He feels that the exploitation of Christ as " the first celebrity " made religion the root of all entertainment . 
 Christ 's death is compared to Abraham Zapruder 's film of the assassination of John F. Kennedy , which Manson called " the only thing that 's happened in modern times to equal the crucifixion " . He sarcastically described the historic home movie as a " good clip of mankind 's generosity to share his violence with the world in such a cinematic way " . Manson stresses the film 's cultural importance , noting the irony of showing such violence on the news while complaining about violence in the entertainment industry . He watched the clip many times as a child , saying it was the most violent thing he had ever seen and juxtaposing Christ and Kennedy : 
 Christ was the blueprint for celebrity . He was the first celebrity , or rock star if you want to look at it that way , and [ dying on the cross ] he became this image of sexuality and suffering . He ’ s literally marketed — A crucifix is no different than a concert T @-@ shirt in some ways . I think for America , in my lifetime , John F. Kennedy kind of took the place of that [ as a modern @-@ day Christ ] in some ways . [ After being murdered on TV ] , he became lifted up as this icon and this Christ figure [ by America ] . 
 Manson also cites John Lennon as an assassinated icon , criticizing the media 's veneration of media martyrs and its conversion of death into spectacle to cater to the American public 's appetite for violence , tragedy and celebrity . He denies claims that Marilyn Manson 's music was responsible for Columbine , speculating how the media would have covered the Crucifixion and linking these observations to Columbine during an interview on the O 'Reilly Factor . Bill O 'Reilly argued that " disturbed kids " without direction from responsible parents could misinterpret the message of his music as endorsing the belief that " when I 'm dead [ then ] everybody 's going to know me " . Manson responded : 
 Well , I think that 's a very valid point and I think that it 's a reflection of , not necessarily this programme but of television in general , that if you die and enough people are watching you become a martyr , you become a hero , you become well known . So when you have these things like Columbine , and you have these kids who are angry and they have something to say and no one 's listening , the media sends a message that says if you do something loud enough and it gets our attention then you will be famous for it . Those kids ended up on the cover of Time magazine [ twice ] , the media gave them exactly what they wanted . That 's why I never did any interviews around that time when I was being blamed for it because I didn 't want to contribute to something that I found to be reprehensible . 
 Despite references to ( and fascination with ) the iconic men , Manson was reluctant to draw comparisons between them and himself ( saying it would have been pretentious ) : " [ w ] hat I did find was parallels in their stories and my story , and I tried to maybe learn from their mistakes and what they tried to do ... You realise you can 't change the world and you can only change yourself , and I think that 's what [ they ] found out " . He added , " [ f ] or me it was about learning from that and trying to break the evolution of man [ since ] it 's man 's nature to be violent " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 In pre @-@ release interviews , Manson said that Holy Wood ( In the Shadow of the Valley of Death ) was intended to be the " industrial White Album ... in the sense that it 's very experimental . I play a lot of keyboards , we switched things around , wrote in the desert ... it 's experimental and when I think of experimental I think of The White Album " . The 1969 Rolling Stones album Let It Bleed ( another source of inspiration ) was written in the same house where Manson wrote Holy Wood . 
 Sonically , Manson said the record was " arrogant in an art rock sense " and the " heaviest " record the band has done . " It needs to be to complete the trilogy " , he said . Most of the songs have three or four parts ( similar to art rock ) , because of the way the story is told . The band took great care to avoid being " self @-@ indulgent " . Manson considers the record entertaining : " Art rock is only self indulgent if it bores you " . CMJ New Music Monthly called the songs " angry and complex " . Rolling Stone noted that " on such songs as ' Target Audience ' , ' Disposable Teens ' and ' Cruci @-@ Fiction in Space ' , [ the band ] dismantles the slick , glam @-@ tinged sound of [ Mechanical ] Animals in favor of the more brutal industrial @-@ goth grind of his first [ two ] albums " . 
 Like Antichrist Superstar Holy Wood uses a song cycle structure , dividing the album into four movements — A : In the Shadow , D : The <unk> , A : Of Red Earth and M : The Fallen — to frame Kadmon 's story . The storyline unfolds in a multi @-@ tiered series of metaphors and allusions ; for example , the album 's title refers not only to the " Hollywood sign " but also to " the tree of knowledge that Adam took the first fruit from when he fell out of paradise , the wood that Christ was crucified on , the wood that [ Lee Harvey ] Oswald 's rifle is made from and the wood that so many coffins are made of " . 
 " <unk> " follows Adam as he meditates in the desert . " The Love Song " is an anthem to Holy Wood 's religion , <unk> . Manson said the idea for the song came from his observation that " Love Song " is one of the most common titles in music , and he wove in a metaphor about guns : " I was suggesting with the lyrics that the father is the hand , the mother is the gun , and the children are the bullets . Where you shoot them is your responsibility as parents " . The chorus is a rhetorical take on an American bumper sticker , which asks " Do you love your God , gun , government ? " 
 The UK music magazine Kerrang ! described " The Fight Song " as a " playground punk anthem " . Manson noted that the song 's theme is Adam 's desire to be a part of Holy Wood , and the track is autobiographical . Speaking broadly , it is about " a person who 's grown up all his life thinking that the grass is greener on the other side , but when he finally [ gets there ] , he realises that it 's worse than where he came from and that it 's truly exploitative " . The line " The death of one is a tragedy , the death of millions is just a statistic " relates to overlooking the deaths of ordinary people , ignored by the media , compared to the media frenzy when someone dies dramatically . 
 " Disposable Teens " is a " signature Marilyn Manson song " , with a bouncing guitar riff and Teutonic , staccato rhythm rooted in glam rocker Gary Glitter 's song " Rock and Roll , Pt.2 " . Its lyrical themes tackle the disenfranchisement of contemporary youth , " particularly those that have been [ brought up ] to feel like accidents " , with the revolutionary idealism of their parents ' generation . The Beatles ' influence is evident in this song , whose chorus echoes the disillusionment of their White Album song " Revolution 1 " . Here , the sentiment is a rallying cry for " disposable teens " against " this so @-@ called generation of revolutionaries " indicted in the song : " You said you wanted evolution , the ape was a great big hit . You say want a revolution , man , and I say that you 're full of shit " . Manson singles out " Target Audience ( Narcissus Narcosis ) " as his favorite song on the album ; to him , it describes every person 's desire for self @-@ actualization . 
 Borrowing a riff from English alternative rock band Radiohead , " President Dead " is a guitar @-@ driven song showcasing John 5 's technical skill . It opens with a sample of Don Gardiner 's ABC News Radio broadcast announcing the death of John F. Kennedy . The song is 3 : 13 long — a deliberate numerological reference to frame 313 of the Zapruder film , the frame with Kennedy 's fatal head shot and the point at which JFK became an American media martyr " because the production value of his murder was so grand ; the cinematography was so well done " . " In the Shadow of the Valley of Death " is an introspective song with Adam at his most emotionally vulnerable , nearly despairing . " Cruci @-@ Fiction in Space " further explores the Kennedy assassination , concluding that human beings have evolved from monkeys to men to guns . " A Place in the Dirt " is another personal song , characterized by Adam 's self @-@ analysis of his place in Holy Wood . 
 " The Nobodies " is a mournful , elegiac dirge with a harpsichord and synthesized @-@ drum introduction . The verse " today I 'm dirty and I want to be pretty , tomorrow I know I 'm just dirt " has an Iggy Pop @-@ style vocal delivery building to the adrenaline @-@ fuelled chorus : " we are the nobodies , we wanna be <unk> , when we 're dead they 'll know just who we are . Some children died the other day , we fed machines and then we prayed , puked up and down in morbid faith , you should have seen the ratings that day " . CMJ noted that the song would be interpreted by some as a tribute to the Columbine shooters , but its point was not to glorify violence ; rather , it was to depict a society drenched in its children 's blood . " The Death Song " is the turning point for Adam ; he no longer cares . Manson described it as sarcastic and nihilistic : " it 's like ' We have no future and we don 't give a fuck ' " . Kerrang ! described it as one of the album 's " heaviest " songs . 
 In " Lamb of God " Manson uses the examples of the assassinations of Jesus Christ , JFK and John Lennon to criticize his accusers , illuminating their hunger for venerating dead people as martyrs and superstars and for turning tragedy into televised spectacle . The bridge paraphrases the chorus of " Across the Universe " . Manson notes that although John Lennon sang " nothing 's going to change my world " , " [ Lennon 's killer ] Mark David Chapman came along and proved him very wrong . That was always something , growing up , that was very sad and tragic to me — a song that I always identified with " . " Burning Flag " is a heavy @-@ metal song reminiscent of American industrial @-@ metal band Ministry . Lennon 's " Working Class Hero " was covered between the band 's August 30 , 2000 appearance at the Kerrang ! Awards and the November 14 launch of the album . Describing Lennon 's idealism and influence , Manson said " some of Lennon 's Communist sentiments in his music later in his life were very dangerous . I think he died because of it . I don 't think his death was any sort of accident . Aside from that , I think he 's one of my favorite songwriters of all time " . 
 = = Promotion = = 
 Promotion began on June 9 , 1999 , with a web update that Manson was composing for a new album in tandem with a screenplay . On December 16 he posted a four @-@ minute video clip and written statement , elaborating on the upcoming album 's themes and featuring excerpts of the band performing two new songs . The first cut was a rock song which later became " Disposable Teens " , and the second was a rough demo cover of the ballad " Little Child " known as " Mommy Dear " . Manson described the album as " the most violent yet beautiful creation we have accomplished . This is a soundtrack for a world that is being sold to kids and then being destroyed by them . But maybe that 's exactly what it deserves " . An acoustic version of " Sick City " , from Charles Manson 's 1970 album Lie : The Love and Terror Cult , later appeared on February 14 , 2000 ; however , this song was not intended to be included in the upcoming album or the Holy Wood feature film . 
 On April 12 , 2000 Manson wrote that they were completing the final stages of recording and posted a downloadable , silent movie documenting the process . This was followed on August 9 with a posting of the Holy Wood novel cover and a sound clip of " The Love Song " the following day . On August 25 he released three tracks ( " Burning Flag " , " Cruci @-@ Fiction in Space " and " The Love Song " ) for digital download on their website . Manson traveled to the UK to perform " Disposable Teens " on the October 12 , 2000 episode of BBC One 's Top of the Pops . On October 27 , the band launched their worldwide Guns , God and Government Tour . Video footage and photographs from shows at the Minneapolis Orpheum Theatre and the Milwaukee Eagles Ballroom ( showing them performing " Disposable Teens " and " The Fight Song " ) were posted on the band 's website November 2 . 
 From November 1 to November 13 , the UK division of Nothing / Interscope Records held a contest to promote the album and launch the UK version of the band 's website . The contest invited fans to log onto the site daily to pick up a series of coded clues which led to a message linked to the album . Fans who solved the riddle received an exclusive download , and were entered into a drawing for a one @-@ week trip for two to meet Manson in Hollywood , California . 
 In mid @-@ 2001 , Universal Music Group was criticized for airing commercials promoting the album on MTV 's Total Request Live . Manson suspected that Senator and former Democratic vice @-@ presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman played a role in the criticism . Lieberman had recently introduced the Media Marketing Accountability Act ( banning the marketing of violent and sexually @-@ explicit media to minors ) in Congress . The proposed legislation stemmed from a Federal Trade Commission investigation he and Senators Sam Brownback and Orrin Hatch requested from US President Bill Clinton at the May 4 , 1999 Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation hearing on entertainment @-@ industry marketing practices to minors .

 On February 29 , 2000 , Manson confirmed that the album was on track for a fall 2000 release . On August 2 , the singer announced a new release date of October 24 and posted a draft of the track listing . Manson then began posting weekly updates on the website , giving fans free access to previews of new songs and artwork . On August 25 , the track listing was released . 
 On September 18 , Manson announced that the album 's US release was postponed to November 14 ( to fine @-@ tune the final mix ) and its first single would be " Disposable Teens " . The album was released on November 13 , 2000 in the UK and on December 5 in Japan by Nothing and Interscope Records . 
 On the evening of November 14 , 2000 , Manson , Ramirez , and John 5 took a break from the tour to celebrate the album with a brief invitation @-@ only acoustic set at the <unk> nightclub in New York City . Tickets were given out in radio contests , on the band 's website and to the first 100 album buyers at Tower Records on Broadway in New York . The set consisted of four songs , including a cover of John Lennon 's " Working Class Hero " and " Suicide Is Painless " , theme of the film ( and TV series ) M * A * S * H. Manson noted that the latter song " [ was ] far more depressing than anything I could have ever written " . The following day , he appeared on Total Request Live in a segment entitled " Mothers Against Marilyn Manson " . The band performed " Disposable Teens " on MTV 's New Year 's Eve celebration ( with a cover of Cheap Trick 's " Surrender " ) and on January 8 , 2001 at the American Music Awards . 
 = = = Singles = = = 
 Holy Wood ( In the Shadow of the Valley of Death ) spawned three singles , the first two of which were released in three versions . The first , " Disposable Teens " , debuted as a music video ( directed by Samuel Bayer ) on Total Request Live October 25 , 2000 . During the following weeks , it was released as two standalone single EPs . The first version , " Disposable Teens Pt.1 " , was released on November 6 in the UK and features Manson 's cover of " Working Class Hero " . It was rereleased as a maxi single in the UK on August 21 , 2002 . The second version , " Disposable Teens Pt.2 " , followed on November 14 , 2000 and features a cover of " Five to One " by The Doors . This version was released in the UK as a maxi single on October 31 , 2000 and a 12 " picture disc vinyl EP on November 6 . 
 The second single , " The Fight Song " , was also released in three versions . The first , " The Fight Song Pt.1 " , was released on January 29 , 2001 in the US and February 19 in the UK ; the latter was a 12 " picture disc vinyl EP . Both feature a remix by Joey Jordison of the heavy metal band Slipknot . The second version , " The Fight Song Pt.2 " , was released on February 2 , 2001 in the US and March 6 in the UK . The music video was directed by <unk> , and sparked controversy for its violent depiction of a football game between jocks and goths ( which some thought exploited the Columbine tragedy ) . Manson dismissed the claims as hype : " Flak is my job " . 
 On February 10 , 2001 Manson indicated that the " The Nobodies " would be the album 's third single . The music video , directed by Paul Fedor , premiered on MTV in June . Manson originally wanted to film the video in Russia " because the atmosphere , the desolation , the coldness and the architecture would really suit the song " . Another early plan was to incorporate the MTV stunt series Jackass , because the song was included in the show 's soundtrack ; however , the idea was abandoned when the show drew the ire of Senator Joseph Lieberman . The third single was released on September 3 , 2001 in the UK and October 6 , 2001 in the US . A remixed version of the song later appeared in the 2001 Johnny Depp film From Hell . 
 = = = Cover and packaging = = = 
 The album 's artwork was designed by P. R. Brown and Marilyn Manson . Manson began conceptualizing it as he wrote the songs , and Brown and Manson worked in tandem to realize the imagery after deciding to do the work themselves . It features elements from alchemy and the tarot . 
 The symbol for the planet Mercury ( common in alchemy ) is a logo . Expanding on its relationship to the album 's concept , Manson said " It represents both the androgyne and the prima materia , which has been associated with Adam , the first man " . 
 The singer commissioned a redesigned set of fourteen Major Arcana tarot cards , based on the Rider @-@ Waite deck . He explained that his interest in tarot was grounded in an attraction to its symbolism , not divination . The cards depict each member of the band in a surrealistic tableau . Each card was reinterpreted , reflecting the iconography of the album ; the Emperor , with prosthetic legs , is sitting in a wheelchair clutching a rifle in front of an American flag ; the Fool is stepping off a cliff , with grainy images of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a JFK campaign poster in the background , and Justice weighs the Bible against the brain on his balance scale . The album 's inner sleeve has nine of these cards : the Magician , the Devil , the Emperor , the Hermit , the Fool , Justice , the High Priestess , Death and The Hierophant . The remaining cards are the Star , the World , the Tower and the Hanged Man . 
 The cover art , which portrays Manson as a crucified Christ with his jawbone torn off , is intended as a criticism of censorship and America 's obsession with media martyrs . It is a cropped version of the reinterpreted Hanged Man card . Under it is an obscured copy of the coroner 's report for John F. Kennedy with the words " clinical record " and " autopsy " . The Marilyn Manson typeface uses the same font as the Disney World logo of the 1960s . Manson explained the cover : " I think it 's more offensive to Christians for me to say , ' I believe in the story of Christ and I enjoy the images that you present , but for different reasons than you ' . I 've taken my own interpretation , that 's more offensive than Antichrist Superstar , and just completely <unk> it . I 'm going to turn a bunch of kids onto Christianity in my own sick , twisted way " . 
 The cover was controversial ; some copies were issued with a cardboard sleeve featuring an alternative cover , since some retailers refused to stock the album with the original artwork . A pastor in Memphis , Tennessee threatened to go on a hunger strike unless the album was pulled from shelves . Manson described these actions as attempts at censorship : " the irony is that my point of the photo on the album was to show people that the crucifixion of Christ is , indeed , a violent image . My jaw is missing as a symbol of this very kind of censorship . This doesn 't piss me off as much as it pleases me , because those offended by my album cover have successfully proven my point " . Gigwise ranked the cover 16th on its list of " The 50 Most Controversial Album Covers Of All Time ! "

 Holy Wood received positive reviews from most critics . At Metacritic ( which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics ) the album received an average score of 72 based on 14 reviews , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised it as " the definitive Marilyn Manson album , since it 's tuneful and abrasive " . He complimented the band for " <unk> [ ing ] out [ how ] to meld the hooks and subtle sonic shading of Mechanical Animals with the ugly , neo @-@ industrial <unk> of Antichrist [ Superstar ] " , and said that " much of its charm lies in Manson trying so hard , perfecting details ... there 's so much effort , Holy Wood winds up a stronger and more consistent album than any of his other work . If there 's any problem , it 's that Manson 's shock rock seems a little quaint in 2000 ... [ However , ] it 's to Warner 's [ frontman Marilyn Manson ] credit as , yes , an artist that Holy Wood works anyway " . 
 Barry Walters of Rolling Stone said , " The band truly rocks : Its malevolent groove fleshes out its leader 's usual complaints with an exhilarating swagger that 's the essence of rock and roll " . LA Weekly was similarly impressed , pointing out that " almost all [ the songs ] contain a double @-@ take chord change or a textural overdose or a mind @-@ blowing bridge , and they 'll be terroristic in concert " . Revolver magazine editor Christopher Scapelliti was impressed by the record 's earnestness : " For all Holy Wood 's well @-@ tempered melodies and drunken pandemonium , what comes across loudest on the album is not the music but the sense of injury expressed in Manson 's lyrics . Like Plastic Ono Band , John Lennon 's bare @-@ boned solo debut , Holy Wood screams with a primal fury that 's evident even in its quietest moments " . According to Billboard magazine , the album proved that Manson is " one of the most skilled lyricists in rock today " . 
 Other critics were less impressed . Drowned in Sound ( which assigns a normalized rating out of 10 ) gave the album a score of 10 ; however , they noted " There [ are ] a number of criticisms that could come Marilyn Manson 's way : too much more of the same , too much philosophical posing , too much sloganeering . Regardless , all this needs to attain perfection is a few minutes shaved off of the overall running time ... [ and ] lyrically it actually says something intelligent for once and musically it has a lot more variation and scope than the Limp <unk> of the world " . PopMatters agreed : " The central flaw of Holy Wood is that the power of its message , an important and provocative one , is watered down by its artistic pretensions . While Holy Wood is often affecting , it would be a better album if it was shorter and dealt with its subject matter directly , instead of through the veil of the ' concept album ' . " Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times was also disappointed that Holy Wood did not live up to " the promise of Mechanical Animals " . In contrast to Erlewine of Allmusic , he viewed the musical cross @-@ pollination of Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals as confusion on the band 's part about " where to turn [ musically ] , as if uncertain which is the right move commercially in a rock world taken over by Limp Bizkit and Eminem " . He concluded that " [ t ] his is music that sounds reasonable on the radio but crumbles under scrutiny " . Joshua Klein of The A.V. Club was also unconvinced , remarking that " [ this ] sort of agitprop is thoroughly predictable , and the only thing that could prove shocking about Manson 's antics would be if the singer actually evinced any power over his followers . Here , he seems entranced by his own power , which may be why his dark worldview sounds baseless even as he offers sharp hooks others would kill for " .

 Since early critical appraisal of Holy Wood was far less favorable than the band 's previous effort , Mechanical Animals , many critics and retailers wondered if the band still had commercial appeal on the early @-@ 2000s music scene . Best Buy 's 2000 sales projections estimated its first @-@ week sales at about 150 @,@ 000 units nationally , significantly less than the 223 @,@ 000 units sold by Mechanical Animals during its first week . In the US the album debuted ( and peaked ) at No. 13 on the Billboard 200 with first @-@ week sales of 117 @,@ 000 , an initial commercial disappointment . 
 The album spent 13 consecutive weeks on the charts before dropping off on March 3 , 2001 , making it the shortest @-@ charting full @-@ length LP by the band until The High End of Low ( 2009 ) . It was overshadowed by Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals ( which spent 52 and 33 weeks on the charts , respectively ) . The album 's sales figures were dismal , and it took three years to attain a gold certification from the RIAA ( in March 2003 ) for shipments of over 500 @,@ 000 units . However , in four other countries ( Australia , Austria , Italy and Sweden ) the album peaked in the top 10 ; in the UK , it peaked at No. 23 . As of 2011 the album has sold over nine million copies worldwide , making it one of the most successful in the band 's catalogue . 
 Seventeen months after Holy Wood ( In the Shadow of the Valley of Death ) ' s release , Manson commented on the album 's lackluster US sales . He attributed the lack of commercial appeal to the musical climate of the time , but argued that it stood up comparatively well to contemporary rock albums . Manson noted that the band 's US sales figures are usually one or two million records , and did not find the sales figures disappointing . 
 = = = Accolades = = = 
 In 2001 Kerrang ! named Holy Wood the year 's best album at their annual Kerrang ! Awards . Manson sardonically remarked , " [ there is ] nothing like a good school shooting to inspire a record " when he collected the award . 
 Kerrang ! ranked Holy Wood ninth on their 2000 list of albums of the year . The British magazine NME ranked the album 34th in their critic 's picks for the 50 best albums of 2000 in their " Decade In Music " series , calling it " a series of heroic rallying cries for the disenfranchised , while also baiting the American Far Right for all it 's worth " . The album ranked 30th in the Critics Top 50 and 9th in the popular poll of the German magazine Musik Express / Sounds in their 2000 Albums of the Year . The French edition of the British magazine Rock Sound ranked Holy Wood 15th in Le <unk> de la <unk> ( the editor 's choice ) and 5th in Le <unk> des <unk> ( readers ' choice ) of their Choix des critiques ( critics ' choice ) of 2000 Albums of the Year . The British magazine Record Collector also ranked the album on their Best of 2000 list . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 In their November 10 , 2010 issue Kerrang ! published a 10th @-@ anniversary commemorative article on the album , " Screaming For Vengeance " , calling it " Manson 's finest hour " . " Set against the backdrop of what the rest of the rock and metal world were attempting at the turn of the century — Limp Bizkit were parading their <unk> with Chocolate Starfish And The Hot Dog Flavored Water and Disturbed were unveiling their contrived anger with The Sickness , for example — it put the singer into a league of his own ... [ and ] a decade on , there has still not been as eloquent and savage a musical attack on the media and mainstream culture as Manson achieved with Holy Wood ... [ It is ] still scathingly relevant today ... perhaps that 's where Holy Wood achieved its greatest success . In deflecting the attention that was targeted at him back onto the media , they reacted exactly as he knew they would : by blustering and further exposing their own inadequacies ... The shame of it all , though , is that so little has changed . That the album is still so relevant today suggests it failed in its task of changing attitudes . That it exists at all , though , is a credit to a man who refused to sit and take it , but instead come out swinging . " 
 = = Guns , God and Government Tour = = 
 To promote the album , the band began a worldwide stadium tour ( the Guns , God and Government Tour ) three days after its scheduled release date and seventeen days before its actual launch . From October 27 , 2000 to September 2 , 2001 , the tour had six legs spanning Eurasia , Japan and North America with 107 shows ( out of 109 planned ) . Typical of the band , the concerts were theatrical and lasted an average of one hour and forty minutes . Sets were designed with communist , religious and " <unk> " imagery . Manson had a number of costume changes during each show : a bishop 's <unk> and mitre ( often confused with papal regalia ) ; a costume made from animals ( including epaulettes made from a horse 's tail and a shirt made from skinned goat heads and ostrich spines ) ; his signature black leather corset , g @-@ string and garter stockings ; an elaborate Roman legionary @-@ style imperial galea ; an Allgemeine SS @-@ style peaked police cap ; a black @-@ and @-@ white fur coat , and a large conical skirt which lifted him 12 metres ( 39 ft ) in the air . 
 The Ozzfest leg marked the band 's first performance in Denver , Colorado ( on June 22 , 2001 at Mile High Stadium ) after the Columbine High School massacre in Littleton . After initially canceling due to a scheduling conflict , the band changed their plans to play the Denver date . The group 's decision met resistance from conservative groups ; Manson received death threats and demands to skip the date . A group of church leaders and families related to Columbine formed an organization opposing the show , Citizens for Peace and Respect , which was supported by Colorado governor Bill Owens and representative Tom Tancredo . On their website , the ad hoc group claimed that the band " promotes hate , violence , death , suicide , drug use , and the attitudes and actions of the Columbine killers " . In response , Manson issued a statement : 
 I am truly amazed that after all this time , religious groups still need to attack entertainment and use these tragedies as a pitiful excuse for their own self @-@ serving publicity . In response to their protests , I will provide a show where I balance my songs with a wholesome Bible reading . This way , fans will not only hear my so @-@ called , ' violent ' point of view , but we can also examine the virtues of wonderful ' Christian ' stories of disease , murder , adultery , suicide and child sacrifice . Now that seems like ' entertainment ' to me . 
 Two films of the concert tour were made . The Guns , God and Government DVD , released by Eagle Rock Entertainment on October 29 , 2002 , featured live concert footage from performances in Los Angeles , Europe and Japan . It also included a 30 @-@ minute behind @-@ the @-@ scenes featurette , The Death Parade , with guest appearances by Ozzy Osbourne and Eminem . Seven years later , it was followed by Guns , God and Government – Live in L.A. Released on Blu @-@ ray by Eagle Rock Entertainment ( a division of Eagle Records ) on November 17 , 2009 , it depicts the entire sixteen @-@ song set of the final show of the tour – the Los Angeles performance .

 = = = Character arc = = = 
 George S. Hammond is a United States Air Force Major General ( later Lieutenant General ) from Texas , who commands Stargate Command ( SGC ) in the first seven seasons of Stargate SG @-@ 1 . The series pilot introduces Hammond as the successor of Major General West , the commander of the Stargate Project in the original Stargate film . Hammond had been stationed as a Lieutenant at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex ( the present @-@ day location of Stargate Command ) in 1969 , Hammond 's mentioned relatives include his wife , who had died of cancer four years before the events of the series began , and his granddaughters named Kayla and Tessa ( whose telephone number occupies Hammond 's first speed dial button above the President of the United States which occupies the second ) . His father is also mentioned in the Season 2 episode entitled 1969 . 
 General Hammond has control over each SG mission , but is rarely directly involved with the off @-@ world adventures of SG teams . He is only shown off @-@ world in season 2 's " Prisoners " , season 3 's " Into the Fire " and the season 7 premiere " Fallen " ; he also commands the Earth spaceship Prometheus in season 7 's " Lost City " and season 8 's " Prometheus Unbound " . Hammond 's command of the SGC is interrupted once in season 4 's " Chain Reaction " , where Hammond retires under duress and is temporarily replaced by Major General Bauer . The series never clearly establishes Hammond 's second @-@ in @-@ command , although producer Joseph Mallozzi stated in season 7 that " if Hammond were to retire , there 's a strong possibility that [ Colonel Jack O 'Neill ] could take over command of the [ Stargate Command ] base " . 
 In the season 7 finale " Lost City " , newly inaugurated President Henry Hayes is pressured into replacing General Hammond with Dr. Elizabeth Weir for a three @-@ month review process of the SGC . Hammond is promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General and is placed in command of the new Homeworld Security department afterwards ; Brigadier General Jack O 'Neill takes over command of Stargate Command in the season 8 opener " New Order " . Hammond appears in the season 1 episode " Home " of Stargate Atlantis , and appears in seasons 8 through 10 of Stargate SG @-@ 1 . After Hammond appears in season 9 's " The Fourth Horseman " in a civilian suit instead of a military uniform , Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter confirms Hammond 's retired status in season 10 's " The Road Not Taken " . In his last appearance in the alternate timeline film Stargate : Continuum , General Hammond acts as a military advisor to President Henry Hayes . Carter reports to Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard in the Stargate Atlantis Season 5 finale / series finale episode , " Enemy at the Gate " that Hammond recently died from a heart attack and that the Daedalus @-@ class ship Phoenix was renamed the George Hammond in his honor .

 According to Approaching The Possible by Jo Storm , the season 2 episode " 1969 " showed that Hammond climbed the military ladder " by being shrewd , intelligent , and [ by being ] possessed of a long vision " despite being a " spouted bottom @-@ line <unk> [ t ] " . Don S. Davis described General Hammond as initially " hard @-@ nosed and straight @-@ ahead " , and later as seemingly " stern and straight @-@ laced " . Recognizing the need to fulfill the role as a General , Davis still tried to " bring a few levels to him that show some understanding and that make him a little more likeable . " The welfare of the men and women under Hammond 's command is paramount in the general 's mind . Besides knowing that people may not return from his sanctioned missions , General Hammond has to decide when to forgo rescue attempts to not put more lives in danger , even if he " always does so reluctantly and with regret " . As shown in " Chain Reaction " , Hammond would rather leave the military quietly than risk the careers and lives of his staff and his family , " which must go against all his blustery Texas background " . 
 Davis appreciated Hammond 's closeness to the SG @-@ 1 team and his willingness to compromise . At the beginning of the series , Hammond does not accept the alien warrior Teal 'c but comes to trust and respect him after realizing Teal 'c's devotion to the Stargate Program . Despite his admiration for Dr. Daniel Jackson 's enthusiasm in the beginning , Hammond has a hard time understanding Daniel 's unorthodox and non @-@ military approach to problems until Hammond comes to realize the importance of a civilian viewpoint to SG @-@ 1 's mission . When the alien Jonas Quinn joins SG @-@ 1 in season 6 , Davis compared Hammond 's response to Jonas to his reaction to Teal 'c in season 1 . Although Hammond does not blame Jonas for Daniel 's death in " Meridian " , " the situation does make it difficult for [ Hammond ] to totally take the young man under his wing and embrace him like family as he has the rest of SG @-@ 1 " . Davis named the NID as Hammond 's only source of frustration , since they regularly outflank Hammond and SG @-@ 1 . Hammond 's only option is to call the President for support , but most cases end with SG @-@ 1 or Hammond breaking the rules to assure the survival of humanity , so " Hammond will do whatever he must to get things done " . 
 = = Conceptual history = = 
 Don S. Davis was a stand @-@ in and stunt @-@ double for Dana <unk> in MacGyver , a 1985 – 1992 television series that starred Richard Dean Anderson ( who also portrayed Stargate SG @-@ 1 's lead character Jack O 'Neill ) . At the time , Davis had suffered burnout from teaching acting classes at the University of British Columbia for ten years , and later considered the work on MacGyver " a new lease on life " . When the producers cast Stargate SG @-@ 1 in 1996 , they asked Davis to read for the role of George Hammond and contracted him for multiple years . Davis considered General Hammond in the initial character breakdown as a two @-@ dimensional by @-@ the @-@ book character and a mere foil for O 'Neill , and was dissatisfied with the view of the pilot episode 's director , Mario Azzopardi , who in particular wanted Hammond to be a military stereotype . Davis , who had served as an army Captain in Korea in the 1960s , felt that the character breakdown did not mirror the reality of military service , and he was reluctant to portray such a role for several years . The producers eventually allowed Davis to humanize the character during the run of the show . 
 The producers wrote season 4 's " Chain Reaction " as " a bit of a Hammond episode " after they had not devoted an episode to Hammond during the first three seasons . The episode ended up " very different " from writer Joseph Mallozzi 's original pitch , which he had envisioned as " a Hammond story in which the general faces a court martial after being implicated in the death of an off @-@ world SG team leader " . When no more Hammond episodes were written in the following seasons , Davis cited Stargate SG @-@ 1 's focus on the off @-@ world adventures of the SG team , the military framework and the general 's knowledge for why Hammond " can be nothing more than peripheral to that action . " 
 After playing General Hammond for nearly 150 episodes in seven seasons , Don S. Davis decided to leave Stargate SG @-@ 1 in late 2003 . He had suffered from prolonged health problems and was grateful that the Stargate SG @-@ 1 producers had previously continued his employment and had scheduled episodes around his surgeries . Davis turned towards painting and sculpting , but continued to work in the film and television industry including the Stargate franchise , continuing to appear in every season of Stargate SG @-@ 1 . Davis died from a heart attack at the age of 65 on June 29 , 2008 , shortly before the release of Stargate : Continuum , his last on @-@ screen appearance as General Hammond . The Stargate producers closed the final Stargate Atlantis episode , " Enemy at the Gate " , with a dedication card to Don S. Davis ; the episode also mentions the off @-@ screen passing of General Hammond , with Earth 's newest ship being named in his honour . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Jo Storm commended Don S. Davis in her book Approaching The Possible for " bring [ ing ] out his character 's actions and motivations with the confidence and thoughtfulness that only a professional of many years can " . In the Stargate SG @-@ 1 pilot , Hammond " set [ s ] up things as advantageously as he can " and proved to be a " competent " and " believable " commander . Talking about Hammond in the season 2 time @-@ travel episode " 1969 " , Storm also credited actor Aaron Pearl , who had done " an amazing job as the younger George Hammond , right down to the slight head tilt and speech lilt " . For his portrayal of Hammond , Don S. Davis was nominated for a 2004 Leo Award in the category " Dramatic Series : Best Supporting Performance by a Male " for the season 7 episode " Heroes , Part 2 " .

 The following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by General Hammond . 
 = XO ( song ) = 
 " XO " is a song by American singer Beyoncé from her fifth studio album , Beyoncé ( 2013 ) . Columbia Records released the song as the lead contemporary hit radio single from the album in the US and Italy on December 16 , 2013 . Ryan Tedder co @-@ wrote and co @-@ produced " XO " with Terius " The @-@ Dream " Nash and Beyoncé , with additional production handled by Chauncey " Hit @-@ Boy " Hollis and <unk> Music . A pure midtempo pop love song , " XO " is complete with electronic musical instrumentation , synthesizers and drums . Musically , it was compared to Beyoncé 's own song " Halo " and was noted for having several music hooks including its call and response chorus . 
 Upon its release , " XO " was acclaimed by music critics , who praised the singer 's raw and low vocals and applauded the song for its pop appeal ; many of them further hailed it as a highlight of the album . However , the usage of an audio sample from Space Shuttle Challenger disaster at the beginning of the song was criticized by the families of the lost crew , NASA , and some media . Beyoncé released a statement saying that the song was intended to help people who have lost loved people in their lives and that the sample was included as a tribute to the Challenger crew . " XO " managed to appear on many music charts across Europe and Oceania and it peaked at number 45 on the US Billboard Hot 100 . 
 A music video for the song directed by Terry Richardson was filmed in Coney Island in late August 2013 . It was made available on iTunes with the release of the album on December 13 , 2013 and was released online three days later . It received positive reviews from critics who described it as a suitable accompaniment for the song , praising its positive atmosphere . Beyoncé performed the song during the last stops of the North American leg of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in December 2013 and later during the tour 's second European leg in early 2014 . To further promote " XO " , she performed it at the 2014 BRIT Awards and later at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards . Haim and John Mayer covered the song in 2014 , with the latter releasing it as a single . 
 = = Production and release = = 
 " XO " was written by Beyoncé , Terius " The @-@ Dream " Nash and Ryan Tedder while the production was helmed by the aforementioned group as well as Chauncey " Hit @-@ Boy " Hollis and <unk> . Ramon Rivas engineered the song , with assistance from Justin Hergett . Beyoncé 's vocals were recorded by Stuart White and Bart Schoudel while all instrumentation and programming was carried out by Tedder . The song was finally mixed by Andrew Scheps . " XO " was recorded in four studios : Jungle City Studios and Oven Studios , both in New York City , Trackdown Studios in Sydney and <unk> Studios in Berlin . 
 During an interview with Australian radio station Nova in November 2013 , Tedder revealed that he had collaborated with Beyoncé on a song for her then @-@ upcoming album along with The @-@ Dream , further saying , " Personally the song we did I like more than ' Halo ' . I think it 's a bigger , better song " . However , he acknowledged that he did not know when the singer planned to release new material for her fifth album . The previous month , it was reported by a source to the Daily News that Beyoncé planned to release a new single and video on December 3 , 2013 . The publication further speculated that the single was expected to be the song whose music video was filmed in August of the same year – " XO " . Later , when Beyoncé was released , Billboard reported that " Blow " would be released as the contemporary hit radio single both in the US and worldwide , and " Drunk in Love " would be sent to urban radio in the US only ; " XO " was scheduled to be released as the second worldwide radio single in 2014 . However , radio programmers reportedly pushed back against the release of " Blow " to mainstream stations , finding its lyrics to be very explicit for the format and proposing that " XO " be released in its place . The release of " Blow " was therefore scrapped and " XO " impacted contemporary hit radio in Italy and adult contemporary radio in the US on December 16 , 2013 . It was also sent to US mainstream , urban and rhythmic radio on December 17 . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " XO " is a midtempo pop love power ballad that bears resemblance to Beyoncé 's own 2008 song " Halo " , which was also produced by Tedder . Influences of electronic rock and reggaeton genres were also found in the song . " XO " was composed using common time in the key of C major , with a tempo of 85 beats per minute . It carries a " celebratory , bumping Caribbean " groove and a marching @-@ drum beat with shuffling dancehall influences . The instrumentation includes jittery keyboards , synthesizers , percussion and electronic musical instruments . The song also consists of electronic flourishes and looped riff patterns brought about by an organ instrument . " XO " was also noted for being a departure from the minimalistic sexual nature of the album , due to its pure pop sound . Jordan Sargent of Complex magazine wrote that " XO " contains influences of Jamaican singer Tanya Stephens . Chris Bosman from Consequence of Sound described the song as a blend of " cinematic reach of modern Top 40 pop with the patience and melancholy of post @-@ 808s & Heartbreaks [ sic ] hip @-@ hop . " Kevin Fallon from The Daily Beast compared the song 's stadium sound to tracks by the band U2 . 
 Beyoncé 's vocals in the song span from the note of A3 to the note of A4 . When asked about her raw vocals in the song previously unheard on her material and the song 's less polished sound , Beyoncé revealed that " XO " was recorded when she had a bad sinus infection . She further revealed it was recorded as a demo in several minutes . The original demo vocals were kept for a year without being rerecorded as the singer " really loved the imperfections " and wanted to focus on the album 's music instead of the vocals . 
 The lyrics of " XO " express a cheerful celebration of love and life as Beyoncé attempts " to create light from darkness " . It has been described as a universal love song which talks about different types of relationships . The singer lays emphasis on the importance of living the present with a person 's loved one as life is unpredictable . She further sings about the tragedy and magnificence that life can hold . Throughout the song , the singer adopts a hopeful attitude and seems to have gone in trance with love , a state which is further augmented by the fact that she employs a generally low register . Caitlin White from the website The 405 interpreted the song 's lyrics in depth : 
 In the darkest night of hate and intolerance we see impossible love stories conquering what our governments and societies declare is legally ' allowed ' to be love ... It is for love that transcends the romantic conception of man and woman and stretches out into the impossibilities of the cosmos . It leaves room for failure but hopes for success . 
 The opening lines of " XO " are echo @-@ laden and in contrast to other songs on Beyoncé , the ballad contains several hooks . Beyoncé starts the song by asking a loved one to kiss her . Some of the ascending chorus lines are call and response ; Beyoncé is backed by a sing @-@ along crowd as she sings about how her " darkest nights " are enlightened by the lover 's face : " In the darkest night hour / I search through the crowd / Your face is all that I see / I give you everything " . The chorus ends with the singer adding , " Baby love me , lights out " , with a croak in her voice . 
 = = Sampling controversy = = 
 The song begins with a six second @-@ long sample of former NASA public affairs officer Steve Nesbitt , recorded moments after Space Shuttle Challenger disaster on January 28 , 1986 : " Flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation . Obviously a major malfunction . " These were the last words spoken before the disintegrating vehicle fell into the sea . The use of the sample has been criticized in the media , including Hardeep Phull of New York Post who described its presence as " tasteless " . Former NASA astronauts and families were also dismayed and labeled the use of the sample as " insensitive " . Keith <unk> of NASA Watch suggested that the use of the clip ranged from negligence to repugnance . 
 On December 30 , 2013 , NASA criticized the use of the sample , stating : " The Challenger accident is an important part of our history ; a tragic reminder that space exploration is risky and should never be trivialized . NASA works every day to honor the legacy of our fallen astronauts as we carry out our mission to reach for new heights and explore the universe . " Earlier on the same date , Beyoncé had issued a statement to ABC News in response to the families , explaining why she and her co @-@ songwriters decided to include the audio sample in " XO " : 
 My heart goes out to the families of those lost in the Challenger disaster . The song ' XO ' was recorded with the sincerest intention to help heal those who have lost loved ones and to remind us that unexpected things happen , so love and appreciate every minute that you have with those who mean the most to you . The songwriters included the audio in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with hope that they will never be forgotten . 
 Forrest Wickman of Slate magazine defended Beyoncé 's choice to use the sample , and criticized the media reports for their " dismissive " interpretation of the song 's " vague " lyrics as being about " a girl in a relationship " . According to Wickman , the lyrics of the song refer to mortality and " the urgency of spending time with the ones you love before you lose them , because you never know when that could be " ; this is shown in the hook lines , " Baby kiss me / Before they turn the lights out / You better kiss me / Before our time has run out . " A similar interpretation was voiced by Douglas Wolk of Wired , who challenged the notion of the sample being simply a " trivialization " , instead describing it as " a swift , understated and brutal reminder that everything can go horribly wrong before anyone understands what 's happening , and that the light could be extinguished at any moment " . Wickman concluded , " If there 's anything anyone should know by now about Beyoncé Knowles , it 's that there 's nothing in her self @-@ presentation that isn 't carefully chosen . " 
 Caitlin White from the website The 405 noted that there was a reason for the song being " couched in warnings " of malfunction and tragedy elaborating , " As far controversy , denying Beyonce the ability to embrace the intertextuality of incorporating a historical recording like the Challenger explosion is an attempt to relegate her art to a lower form of political discourse , one that 's not ' worthy ' of interacting with an event of cultural significance like this . But this is not just a ' pop album , ' it 's a woman holding forth on the role of women in our society , how they should approach the nuances of their life and most importantly , how they can choose to value relationships ... That isn 't just the work of a diva , that is the work of a political figure . " 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Upon its release , " XO " received critical acclaim . Many critics praised the song 's radio appeal in contrast with the rest of the album and hailed it as single worthy . Mike Wass of the website Idolator described it as a " radio @-@ ready anthem ... [ which ] is impossible to beat " . Vanity Fair writer Michelle Collins described it as " the most upbeat and catchiest song of the lot " on the album . Ryan Dennehy from the website AbsolutePunk opined that " XO " was a guaranteed , triumphant hit . Andrew Hampp and Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine described " XO " as " magical " further calling it the most radio @-@ friendly song on the entire album with its traditional pop structure . Peter <unk> from the website Pretty Much Amazing listed the " magnificent power ballad " as one of the " potential chart @-@ toppers " of the album . Michael Cragg of The Guardian called the track a " joyous , echo @-@ laden heart burst , " and an immediate choice for a single . Stereogum 's Tom Breihan found " an immediately apparent hit [ in Beyoncé is ] ... the incandescent ' XO ' " . Rob Harvilla from Spin found " monster @-@ single potential " in " XO " . Marc Hogan of the same publication described the song as a potential radio hit " that looms largest " from the album . He further went on to praise its " grandly swaying hook that makes the one from Jessie Ware 's ' Wildest Moments ' sound understated " . Lindsay Zoladz of Pitchfork Media praised the song 's " big , boundary @-@ obliterating " pop appeal and hailed it as a future blockbuster and hit . She went on to praise the singer 's vocal performance in the song concluding " all of the <unk> here is brilliantly undercut by that gravelly croak " . 
 The song 's pop and sing @-@ along sound and production received praise by critics . Greg Kot from the Chicago Tribune described the song 's production as " predictable " and opined that the audience sing @-@ along chorus sounded like it was created specifically for being performed during an arena encore . Similarly , Nathan S. of the website DJ Booth wrote that the song was suitable for " ecstatic " fans to sing along without efforts during a stadium concert : " This is the kind of chorus that 's going to be sung at full force in traffic jams for months to come , and while XO may be relatively more subdued , that call and response is destined to be a monster when performed live , right down to the way her voice shows a little wear , just like it would at the end of a show . " Jody Rosen writing for Vulture found a " cavernous widescreen " anthemic pop sound in the song further saying that its chorus sounded like it was specifically made for an Olympics opening ceremony . Carrie Battan of Pitchfork described the song as a " stadium @-@ filling " one and classified it as one of Beyoncé 's " decorous moments " . Joe Lynch from Fuse described " XO " as the " most uplifting " pop song since Florence and the Machine 's " Shake It Out " ( 2011 ) . He praised the electronic flourishes , saying that they managed to " keep the music from veering into banal territory " and concluded that the song has a " quirky " sound previously unheard on other material by Beyoncé . Philip Sherburne of Spin found " zero @-@ G bounce ... which , purely in terms of sonics , makes the most compelling argument for space tourism I have yet to come across " . 
 Many critics considered " XO " to be a highlight on the album . Drowned in Sound 's Robert Leedham opined in his review of the album , " Most glorious of all is ' XO ' , a supermassive , dumbstruck ode to being in love and caring about fuck all else . It 's the one album track that 's linear enough to withstand a drunken singalong . " Lavanya <unk> of The Washington Post described the song as a " swelling anthem " and one of the highlights of Beyoncé . Caitlin White from the website The 405 , hailed " XO " as " the album 's crowning track ... [ it ] feels like even more of a triumph " . Philip Cosores from Paste magazine noted that the song , along with several others in the closing portion of the album , was " probably the best of her career " . Jordan Sargent from Complex magazine described " XO " as the " purest love song " on Beyoncé . However , a more mixed review came from Claire Lobenfeld of the same publication who felt that it was the only skippable track of the album due to its " mawkish " feel . Similarly , Chris Kelly of Fact magazine wrote that the song " reeks of Ryan Tedder 's paint @-@ by @-@ number hitmaking " .

 Under the Radar 's Ryan E.C. Hamm argued that " XO " made " a strong case " for being included as song of the year on several year @-@ end lists ; however he noted that this was not possible as the lists had already been compiled and published when the song was released . However , Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone placed " XO " at number 8 in his year @-@ end list of the 25 best songs of 2013 . The song was further ranked at number 72 in the annual Pazz and Jop mass critics poll of the year 's best in music . In 2014 , Vulture 's writer Jody Rosen listed the song at number 52 on his list of " The 150 Greatest Schlock Songs Ever " calling it " an instant classic " : " The grand , sparkly production screams 2013 ; the theme — how love bears out to the edge of doom and all that — is timeless . " The same year , he further included the song in his list of the best songs by Beyoncé published in The New York Times . " XO " is nominated in the category for Best Song at the 2014 World Music Awards .

 The music video for " XO " was directed by Terry Richardson . It was filmed on August 29 , 2013 on Coney Island 's Cyclone roller coaster . On that same day , Beyoncé was spotted at that location . It was later confirmed by several publications that Beyoncé was filming a video for a then @-@ upcoming song titled " XO " from her upcoming fifth album . The Daily Telegraph further reported that fashion models Jourdan Dunn , Jessica White and Diandra Forrest were present during the filming of the video . Several scenes for the video were also filmed during Beyoncé 's concert at the Brazilian festival Rock in Rio at Rio de Janeiro in 2013 where the singer asked the crowd to make X and O shapes with their hands ; the hand movement choreography was created by Lee Anne Callahan @-@ Longo , the general manager at Parkwood Entertainment . During a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes video , Richardson described the process for the filming of the clip for " XO " , 
 " You know , it 's amazing cause in one point we were like in the arcade and I said to Beyoncé let 's just do this . You wanna open the door and you 're gonna perform and we 're just gonna walk out and see what happens and she was like ' Yeah , let 's go for it ' . And literally we came out the door and it was like just hundreds of people sort of coming around us . People everywhere , cameras , people yelling her name . It was incredible , I have never experienced anything like that . It was really reportage , loose , not planned , we went with feeling , we went with instinct ... It 's a beautiful cycle of energy . " 
 Beyoncé further described the filming of the video as " insanely chaotic " before adding that it captured " raw , fun and being in the moment " . In order to prevent snippets of the song being leaked online , the singer wore earbuds during the filming of the video instead of playing the music loud and lip synced the lyrics . The music video for " XO " was first released on the iTunes Store on the visual album itself on December 13 , 2013 , which contained a previously filmed music video for every song . It was later released to Vevo on December 16 , 2013 along with the video for " Drunk in Love " .

 = Too Much ( Spice Girls song ) = 
 " Too Much " is a song by the British pop group Spice Girls . Written by the group members with Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins — the songwriters and production duo known as Absolute — at the same time as the group was filming scenes for their movie Spice World , it was produced by Wilson and Watkins for the group 's second album Spiceworld , released in November 1997 . 
 " Too Much " is a pop ballad with influences of R & B. It features instrumentation from a guitar , brass and string instruments , and is structured using doo @-@ wop records as a template . The music video , directed by Howard Greenhalgh , features each Spice Girl in their own individual scene playing different characters , inspired by their own movie fantasies . The song received mixed reviews from music critics , with many of them criticising the R & B @-@ infused production . 
 Released as the album 's second single in December 1997 , it topped the UK Singles Chart for two weeks , becoming the group 's second consecutive Christmas number @-@ one single , and their sixth consecutive chart @-@ topper , which made them the first act to have its first six singles reach number one in the United Kingdom . It was moderately successful internationally , peaking inside the top twenty on the majority of the charts that it entered . Although in the United States " Too Much " did better than its predecessor , " Spice Up Your Life " ; peaking nine places higher on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming their fourth and final top ten single on the chart ; it failed to match the success of the group 's previous singles from the Spice album .

 In June 1997 , the group began filming scenes for their movie Spice World . At the same time , Virgin Records started the first marketing meetings for the Spiceworld album 's promotional campaign , set to be released in November . No songs had been written for the album at this point , so the group had to do all the song @-@ writing and recording at the same time as they were filming the movie . Between takes , and at the end of each filming day , the group usually went straight into a mobile recording studio set up in a Winnebago , which followed them between film sets . The schedule was physically arduous with logistical difficulties , as Melanie Brown commented in her autobiography : " doing the two full @-@ time jobs at the same time took its toll and within a couple on weeks , exhaustion set in . " 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 The concept of " Too Much " was mainly penned by Geri Halliwell while the group was filming Spiceworld in a closed set besieged by fans and the media , in London 's Docklands . While Halliwell left the set , sitting in the backseat of a car , she started scribbling a few lines in a notebook about " love being blind and how words that appear deep may be meaningless " . The other members then helped to complete the song . Halliwell , inspired by a T @-@ shirt that said " What part of no don 't you understand ? " , wrote the song 's middle eight with Melanie Chisholm at Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins ' — the songwriters and production duo known as Absolute — studio in Richmond , London . Wilson commented about the song : 
 Geri came in and sang : ' Too much of something / Da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da ... Right . OK . You got that ? ' We started working on it and we wanted to do some sort of doo @-@ wop vocal thing . So we constructed this backing track and then more of the girls started to come in — this was quite a good day — and gradually they started to add on their little bits . 
 Absolute structured the song using doo @-@ wop records as a template . The format was for Emma Bunton to sing the high part , Melanie Brown , Victoria Beckham , and Halliwell singing the lower and middle parts , and Chisholm adding the ad @-@ libs . The song was recorded in a caravan in the middle of mayhem . Wilson and Watkins doggedly worked on it with whichever of the group 's members were available from the filming set at any given point . A considerable amount of production work was required afterward before the track reached its final form . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Too Much " is a pop ballad , with influences of R & B music and doo @-@ wop sounds . It is written in the key of F ♯ minor , with a time signature set in compound quadruple meter , commonly used in doo @-@ wop , and moves at a slow tempo of 80 beats per minute . 
 The song is constructed in a verse @-@ chorus form , with a bridge before the third chorus , and its instrumentation comes from a guitar , brass and string instruments . It starts with an instrumental introduction , with a chord progression of A – <unk> – Dmaj7 – G7 that is also used during the first part of the verses and the chorus . Brown and Bunton sing the first lines of the first verse ; the progression then changes to Bm7 – E – Dmaj7 – C ♯ 7 during the last part of the verse , which is sung by Chisholm . After the chorus , the same pattern occurs leading to the second chorus , with Halliwell , Beckham , and Chisholm singing the second verse . The progression changes to Bm7 – C ♯ m7 – <unk> – F ♯ 7 ( ♯ 9 ) as Chisholm sings the bridge , while the rest of the group adds the high harmony . The group sing the chorus twice , and repeats the ad @-@ lib as the song fades out . The album version , which is forty seconds longer than the radio edit , features an instrumental section at the end of the track .

 " Too Much " was released in the United Kingdom on 15 December 1997 , in two single versions .

Sylvia Patterson of the NME characterised the song as a " lavish , harmonised spree of New Orleans loveliness with strings and Spanish guitar " , adding that it is " the absolute tops ! " . Ian Hyland of The Daily Mirror enjoyed the track , but felt that Chisholm sounded " daft " , and added that she needs to " calm down on the <unk> front " .

The Virginian @-@ Pilot said that the strings on the song are " classic soul with a 90s tweak " . Larry Flick of Billboard magazine praised the song , describing it as a " <unk> classic @-@ pop ballad that tickles the ear with tasty doo @-@ wop flavors " , and added that the arrangement and the group 's harmonies " work extremely well together " . Sputnikmusic 's Amanda Murray also complimented the track , calling it a " genuinely great song " . Murray also felt that the group 's voices had improved so that they could " pull off more difficult passages with at least an iota of conviction " . 
 Some reviewers criticised the R & B @-@ infused production . In a review of Spiceworld , the Contra Costa Times said that the album 's ballads such as " Too Much " and " Viva Forever " are " both treacly and deadly dull " . Conversely , Gina Arnold of Salon.com said that the ballads are " blander but still appealing " . South Florida Sun @-@ Sentinel 's Sean Picolli said that the song is " a sincere stab at instructional R & B " . Richard Harrington of The Washington Post described it as a " lugubrious ballad " , while Scott Schinder of Newsday said that " the contempo @-@ R & B schmaltz of ' Too Much ' [ ... ] mires the group in middle @-@ of @-@ the @-@ road mediocrity " . J.D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun was not convinced by the song 's " attempts at deep emotional expression " , and Anthony <unk> of The Buffalo News said that it is " supposed to be a heart tugging ballad that may even make the Spice Girls fan base of 10 @-@ year olds overdose on sugar " .

 " I 'd Have You Anytime " is a song written by George Harrison and Bob Dylan , released in 1970 as the opening track of Harrison 's first post @-@ Beatles solo album , All Things Must Pass . As such , it was the first solo song many people heard Harrison sing . The pair wrote the song at Dylan 's home in Bearsville , near Woodstock in upstate New York , in November 1968 . Its creation occurred during a period when Harrison had outgrown his role in the Beatles and Dylan had withdrawn from the pressures of fame to raise a family . " I 'd Have You Anytime " is recognised as a statement of friendship between the two musicians , whose meetings from 1964 onwards resulted in changes in musical direction for both Dylan and the Beatles . The song reflects the environment in which it was written , as Harrison 's verses urge the shy and elusive Dylan to let down his guard , and the Dylan @-@ composed choruses respond with a message of welcome . 
 As a gentle ballad , " I 'd Have You Anytime " went against pop @-@ music convention of the time for an album opener . The recording was co @-@ produced by Phil Spector in London and features a much @-@ admired lead guitar part by Eric Clapton . With the strong public association that existed between Harrison and Dylan by 1970 , some music critics remarked on the American singer 's presence on All Things Must Pass , even though he did not contribute to the album . Harrison and Dylan went on to enjoy further collaborations after writing the song , culminating in their recording together as members of the Traveling Wilburys in 1988 – 90 . 
 An alternate take of " I 'd Have You Anytime " , recorded during the All Things Must Pass sessions , appears on the 2012 Harrison compilation Early Takes : Volume 1 . Harrison and Dylan 's demo of the song circulates on bootleg compilations , but it has never received an official release . <unk> Pagán and Evan Rachel Wood are among the artists who have covered " I 'd Have You Anytime " .

 Bob Dylan first met the Beatles in New York City in August 1964 , at the height of the band 's fame . The meeting was arranged by New York journalist Al Aronowitz , who later remarked on the significance of this introduction : " <unk> 't the whole world benefited ? ... The Beatles ' magic was in their sound . Bob 's magic was in his words . After they met , the Beatles ' words got grittier , and Bob invented folk @-@ rock . " Author Gary Tillery has written of the connection established between Dylan and George Harrison : " Dylan was particularly keen on meeting [ John ] Lennon , the writer @-@ artist @-@ intellectual of the group , but the deepest and longest @-@ lasting bond begun that night was with George Harrison . Their two reclusive personalities meshed ... " 
 The connection developed in May 1966 , when Harrison , Lennon and Paul McCartney visited Dylan in his London hotel , midway through his controversial world tour with backing band the Hawks . According to musicologist Ian MacDonald , Dylan 's relationship with Lennon was a testy , competitive one at times , and Dylan was " cooler " towards McCartney , whose best @-@ known songs he regarded as " sell @-@ outs to soft pop " ; but in producer Bob Johnston 's estimation , Lennon , Harrison and McCartney entered the hotel suite as members of the Beatles and departed as three distinct individuals , such was Dylan 's philosophical influence on fellow songwriters at the time . Following his creative peak in mid 1966 with the Blonde on Blonde double album , Dylan retired to Bearsville , New York , accompanied by the Hawks ( soon to become the Band ) , in order to recuperate from a motorcycle crash and raise a family with his wife , Sara Lownds . Little was heard from him throughout 1967 – 68 , a situation that added to his mystique as music critics and fans awaited his return . 
 While Dylan was dismissive of the Beatles ' landmark album Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ( 1967 ) , Harrison remained an avowed fan of Dylan 's work – Blonde on Blonde being the only Western music that Harrison took with him to India in February 1968 . Following the sessions for the Beatles ' White Album , Harrison worked in Los Angeles for much of October and November 1968 , producing the debut solo album by Jackie Lomax , one of the first signings to the Beatles ' Apple record label . Harrison and his wife , Pattie Boyd , then spent Thanksgiving with the <unk> while staying in the Catskills as guests of manager Albert Grossman . Despite Dylan 's excitement at their arrival , Harrison found him withdrawn and seemingly lacking in confidence . Music journalist John Harris notes that , unlike in their previous meetings , " there were no hangers @-@ on [ this time ] , Dylan 's head was clear , and the protective barriers of cool could come down – which , eventually , they did . " On the third day , Harrison recalls in his 1980 autobiography , I , Me , Mine , " we got the guitars out and then things loosened up " .

 The year 1968 marked the start of what Dylan himself later termed his " amnesia " , referring to a form of writer 's block he experienced post @-@ John Wesley Harding ( 1967 ) , when painting had replaced songwriting as his preferred creative outlet . Well known for his unsophisticated musical approach , particularly in comparison to Harrison 's broader " harmonic palette " , author Simon Leng suggests , Dylan was now eager to learn some more @-@ advanced chords . Harrison began demonstrating various major seventh , diminished and augmented chord shapes – " all these funny chords people showed me when I was a kid " , as he later put it . While playing a G major 7 chord and taking the shape up the guitar neck to B ♭ major 7 , Harrison realised , " Ah , this sounds like a tune here ... " Keen to break down the barriers that Dylan had imposed , Harrison came up with the song 's opening lines : 
 Let me in here 
 I know I 've been here 
 Let me into your heart … 
 At the same time , he was pushing Dylan to come up with some words of his own . Dylan duly supplied a rejoinder , in the form of the song 's bridge @-@ chorus : 
 All I have is yours 
 All you see is mine 
 And I 'm glad to hold you in my arms 
 I 'd have you anytime . 
 " Beautiful ! – and that was that " , Harrison concludes in I , Me , Mine . He subsequently finished the composition alone . 
 The lyrics reflect an approach regarding demonstrating love for his close friends that Harrison 's widow Olivia has described as " very unabashed , quite romantic in a sense " , as well as a view expressed by Tom Petty , a fellow Traveling Wilbury with Harrison and Dylan in 1988 – 90 , that Harrison was able to probe the notoriously elusive Dylan in a way that few others could . Author Ian Inglis views " I 'd Have You Anytime " as working as a straightforward love song , with Harrison 's " Let me into your heart " serving as " not a desperate plea but a reassuring conversation " , and Dylan 's " All I have is yours / All you see is mine " providing the same " element of reciprocity that distinguished the declaration of love " in Harrison 's song " Something " .

 In his Harrison biography , Here Comes the Sun , Joshua Greene notes the effect that this time with Dylan and the Band had on Harrison , with regard to his growing dissatisfaction as a Beatle . " Like Dylan , George was beginning to see that his next step needed to be away from everything he had done up to that moment " , Greene writes . " Watching Dylan over Thanksgiving ... showed George how happy someone could be following his own direction and making his own rules . " In his essay for Mojo magazine covering Harrison 's 1970 solo release , All Things Must Pass , John Harris identifies this time in Woodstock as the beginning of Harrison 's " journey " to making the album . 
 Harrison and Dylan wrote at least one other song together during Thanksgiving 1968 : " When Everybody Comes to Town " , subsequently renamed " Nowhere to Go " . Dylan also showed Harrison " I Don 't Want to Do It " , which , like " Nowhere to Go " , Harrison would later consider for inclusion on All Things Must Pass but discard . As for Dylan 's future output , songs such as " I Threw It All Away " on Nashville Skyline ( 1969 ) showed a more complex musical structure than before , a departure from his usual three @-@ chord compositions . 
 The next meet @-@ up between Harrison and Dylan occurred in August 1969 , when the latter was in England to appear at the Isle of Wight Festival with the Band . Harrison wrote " Behind That Locked Door " at that time – a song that Harris describes as " a sweet acknowledgement of Dylan 's shyness " . In its review of the Beatles ' Abbey Road album ( 1969 ) , Time magazine highlighted " Something " as the best track and identified Harrison 's time with Dylan as having " helped him achieve a new confidence in his own musical personality " beside the traditionally more dominant Lennon and McCartney . During the same period , according to engineer and producer Glyn Johns ' recollection in his book Sound Man ( 2014 ) , Dylan expressed an interest in recording an album with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones . Harrison and Keith Richards were enamoured with the idea , Johns continues , but McCartney and Mick Jagger " both said absolutely not " . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Simon Leng describes Harrison 's various musical activities outside the Beatles during 1968 – 70 as a " three @-@ year <unk> 's holiday " , which came to an end once McCartney announced his departure from the band on 9 April 1970 . Before beginning work on All Things Must Pass with co @-@ producer Phil Spector , Harrison attended a session for Dylan 's New Morning album in New York City , on 1 May . With backing from Charlie Daniels and Russ Kunkel , Dylan and Harrison recorded a version of " If Not for You " , a new song of Dylan 's that Harrison subsequently covered on All Things Must Pass , and two tracks that appear on New Morning : " Went to See the Gypsy " and " Day of the Locusts " . Although it was not a song they played at Columbia 's Studio B that day , Harrison and Dylan recorded a demo of " I 'd Have You Anytime " during a jam session held at Dylan 's Greenwich Village townhouse on 30 April , with Kunkel accompanying them on bongos . The song was one of many tracks that Harrison had already shortlisted for his own album , recording for which began at London 's Abbey Road Studios in late May . 
 The released recording of " I 'd Have You Anytime " features a sparse musical arrangement , in what Leng terms the " minimalist " tradition of Dylan and the Band , similar to the treatment given to " Behind That Locked Door " , " Run of the Mill " and " If Not for You " . Harrison played acoustic guitar on the song , while Eric Clapton contributed an electric guitar part that author Bruce Spizer describes as " exquisite " . Leng views Clapton 's solos as " all but mimicking " Harrison 's playing on the Beatles ' " Something " . 
 As with several of the tracks on All Things Must Pass , the remaining musician credits have traditionally been the subject of some conjecture . After consulting German musician Klaus Voormann and orchestral arranger John Barham , Leng credits the rhythm section on " I 'd Have You Anytime " as being Voormann ( on bass ) and Alan White ( drums ) . According to Spizer also , the overdubbed vibraphone ( often referred to as a xylophone ) was played by either White or Barham , who had first collaborated with Harrison on the latter 's Wonderwall Music film soundtrack ( 1968 ) . While Leng and Spizer credit Barham with a string arrangement on " I 'd Have You Anytime " , American musician Bobby Whitlock writes in his 2010 autobiography that the sound was a harmonium , which he himself often played during sessions for the album . In Whitlock 's recollection , the personnel supporting Harrison on the recording were the future line @-@ up for Derek and the Dominos : Clapton , Carl Radle on bass , Jim Gordon on drums , and Whitlock on harmonium . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Defying pop convention – as the Band 's Music from Big Pink had in July 1968 , by opening with the funereal " Tears of Rage " – Harrison selected the slow , gentle " I 'd Have You Anytime " as track 1 on All Things Must Pass , which was released on Apple Records in late November 1970 . He later attributed the message behind its opening line , " Let me in here " , as his motivation for placing the song first in the running order , along with the confidence engendered by Dylan and Clapton 's involvement . 
 From mid 1970 , the association between Harrison and Dylan had created much speculation in the music press , their New York session on 1 May having been hyped up as a " monster " recording marathon in the months since . Critics were still awaiting Dylan 's return to artistic eminence after two albums , Nashville Skyline and the recent Self Portrait , that had caused confusion in rock @-@ music circles . Dylan 's influence on All Things Must Pass was detectable " at a number of levels " , Ian Inglis writes ; in their 1975 book The Beatles : An Illustrated Record , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler described Dylan as a " phantom presence " on Harrison 's album , while author Robert Rodriguez labels him an " unmistakable specter " . On release , with regards to " I 'd Have You Anytime " , Rolling Stone 's Ben Gerson opined that " the two together don 't come up with much " . More impressed , Alan Smith of the NME described the song as " wistful and touching " . In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever , Nicholas Schaffner also wrote of Dylan 's presence being " strongly felt … in spirit if not in person " . Schaffner viewed the " Dylanesque numbers " as " somewhat overshadowed " by those with the obvious Spector Wall of Sound production qualities , but identified songs such as " I 'd Have You Anytime " , " If Not for You " and " Behind That Locked Door " as being " far more intimate , both musically and lyrically , than the rest of the album " . 
 In subsequent decades , following their work together in the Traveling Wilburys , the Harrison – Dylan connection has attracted less scrutiny . Writing in Rolling Stone in 2002 , Mikal Gilmore described " I 'd Have You Anytime " and " If Not for You " as " surprisingly beautiful " , while Richie Unterberger of AllMusic lists " I 'd Have You Anytime " as one of five " track picks " on an album where " nearly every song is excellent " . Writing for the music website Something Else ! , Nick DeRiso rates " I 'd Have You Anytime " among the highlights of Harrison 's solo career on Apple Records . DeRiso describes the track as " [ e ] very bit as moving as Abbey Road triumphs like ' Something ' " and " a gutsy opening song for such an enormous undertaking " . In The Rough Guide to the Beatles , Chris Ingham opines : " Yet for all the impact of the sonic scale [ of All Things Must Pass ] , it 's perhaps the quieter moments that endure . The beautiful I 'd Have You Anytime is Harrison at his most harmonically luxurious … the song has George showing [ Dylan ] his posh major sevenths and Bob responding with the forthright middle eight . " 
 Among Beatles and Harrison biographers , Rodriguez considers the song to be an " exquisite " opening track , while Chip Madinger and Mark Easter rate it " A low @-@ key opener for such a behemoth of an album , but an effective one " . Bruce Spizer describes it as " a beautiful ballad " that " [ hints ] at greater things to come " . Elliot Huntley similarly views " I 'd Have You Anytime " as the " perfect choice " for the first song , and praises the " drifting quality " of Harrison 's vocals on this " haunting , dream @-@ like lullaby " , as well as Clapton 's " tastefully beautiful " lead guitar . Simon Leng considers the track to be " Beautifully sung " and " evidence that ' Something ' was no fluke " .

 The Harrison – Dylan demo of " I 'd Have You Anytime " has never received an official release , although from the late 1970s , it began circulating among collectors on bootleg compilations , which stated an incorrect recording date of 1 May 1970 . According to Dylan chronicler Olof <unk> and Eight Arms to Hold You authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter , Harrison and Dylan may have recorded the demos for this song and " Nowhere to Go " in Bearsville , during the original composing session in 1968 . Both songs appear on bootlegs such as The Dylan Harrison Sessions and The Beatles – 20 x 4 . 
 In November 2011 , in its deluxe edition format , the British DVD release of Martin Scorsese 's documentary George Harrison : Living in the Material World contained a CD that included an alternate take of " I 'd Have You Anytime " . Harrison archive producer Giles Martin describes it as " very organic ... a very fragile version of the song " . The CD was released internationally in May 2012 as Early Takes : Volume 1 .

 Since his death in November 2001 , " I 'd Have You Anytime " has appeared on Harrison tribute albums such as He Was Fab ( 2003 ) , on which <unk> contribute a " low @-@ key , near @-@ epic version " of the song , according to AllMusic 's Tom Sendra , and Suburban Skies ' George ( 2008 ) .

 = Ralph Townsend = 
 Ralph Townsend ( 27 November 1900 – 25 January 1976 ) was an American author , consul and political activist noted for his opposition to the entry of the United States into World War II . Townsend was born in North Carolina and educated in New York . He served in the foreign service as a consul stationed in Canada and China from 1931 to 1933 . Shortly after returning to the United States he came to prominence through his book Ways That Are Dark : The Truth About China , a harsh critique of Chinese culture which became a widely controversial bestseller . Townsend became a prominent advocate of non @-@ interventionism , and in the 1930s and 1940s was well known for his vocal opposition to the Roosevelt administration 's foreign policy from a pro @-@ Japanese and pro @-@ neutrality point of view . 
 Following the US entry into World War II Townsend was arrested for acting as a Japanese agent without registering under the Foreign Agents Registration Act . He pleaded guilty , admitting that he had accepted payments before the war from a propaganda organization funded by the Japanese government , but denying that he was a Japanese agent . He received a prison sentence and while serving was involved in the Great Sedition Trial . After the war Townsend moved to Fairfax , Virginia , where he died on 25 January 1976 . His writings continue to be influential in far @-@ right circles . 
 = = Early life , 1900 – 33 = = 
 Ralph Townsend was born on 27 November 1900 in Raynham , North Carolina to " one of Robeson county 's oldest and most prominent families . " After graduating from Mount Hermon Preparatory School in Massachusetts , he attended Columbia University in New York City and in 1924 received his degree from Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism . He worked as a journalist in San Francisco for several years before returning to New York where he taught English at Columbia University from 1927 to 1930 . On 11 November 1930 he passed the foreign service test and was posted to Montreal , Canada , as vice @-@ consul on 20 December 1930 . 
 His second assignment was to Shanghai , where he officially served as vice @-@ consul between 10 December 1931 and 9 January 1932 , though a two @-@ month temporary detail kept him in the city long enough to witness the Shanghai Incident firsthand . After that he was stationed in Fuzhou up to his resignation from the service on 1 March 1933 . 
 = = Writing on Asian affairs , 1933 – 37 = = 
 Townsend 's experiences in China formed the basis of his first book Ways That Are Dark : The Truth About China , the release of which on 10 November 1933 put Townsend in the spotlight both nationally and internationally . Billed as doing " for China what Katherine Mayo did for Mother India " , Townsend 's book included a controversial critique of Chinese society and culture . At a time when China was in the grip civil strife , Townsend believed that the source of its problems lay in fundamental defects in the ethics of its people , including above all their propensity for dishonesty , lack of fixed loyalties outside of their family group , and inability to cooperate effectively with one another , as well as their greed , physical cowardice , and lack of critical thinking skills . He concludes that the " outstanding characteristics " of the Chinese people " neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them , nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves " and predicts no end to chaotic conditions within the country . He also favorably contrasts what he considers Japan 's sensible policies toward China with the naively " sentimentalist " ones adopted by the United States . 
 Ways That Are Dark became a bestseller and attracted vociferous reactions from both critics and supporters . Writing for Current History , E. Francis Brown praised the book as " a welcome antidote to much that has been written in recent years and some of its conclusions might be well pondered by those who shape America 's Far Eastern Policy , " but by contrast the prominent sinologist Owen Lattimore denounced the work as " a general indictment of a whole race " which lacked insight , relied on second @-@ hand accounts , and would " only convince people who are convinced already . " The book itself was entangled in the political turmoil it discussed , being banned by the government of China but distributed free of charge by the government of Japan . 
 The <unk> , a newspaper of Townsend 's native county , reported in February 1934 that he had " aroused more glowing praise and bitter abuse for his lectures and written comments on China than any other recent speaker and writer on Far East affairs . " Townsend moved from New York back to San Francisco in 1934 where he continued to write and give lectures on Asian issues as well as teaching classes at Stanford University and advertising for the San Joaquin Light and Power Corporation . Until 1941 he resided in a number of Californian cities near San Francisco . 
 In 1936 , Townsend published his second book , Asia Answers , in which he heaps praise on what he deems to be Japan 's thriving political , economic , and cultural model and its growing and positive influence in Asia . He attributes anti @-@ Japanese sentiment in the United States to pro @-@ communist " liberals " , above all the sensationalist newspaper editors and journalists who , he believes , despise Japan due to its status as the leading capitalist nation in Asia . He condemns liberals for having already wrecked the US economy , warns of a possible communist takeover of the United States , and ends by advocating that America resist anti @-@ Japanese warmongering and adopt a foreign policy of neutrality towards Asia . 
 Townsend predicted that Asia Answers might have a frosty reception from reviewers because of what he alleged to be the pro @-@ Soviet biases of the media , and indeed , the book received negative coverage in The China Weekly Review , The Times Literary Supplement , The Times of India , and The Living Age , the last of which deemed Asia Answers a work " suspiciously similar to press releases by the Tokyo Foreign Office " which would appeal to " none except avowed Fascists " . Among the book 's detractors was also Pearl S. Buck who described it as " so fraught with the prejudices and personality of the writer that it is impossible to criticize any of it without involving the author 's whole scheme . " On the other hand , the book was received more positively in Japan and in Manchukuo , where <unk> Koyama , a leader in the Manchuria Youth League , declared that " [ Townsend 's ] understanding of China is impeccable " and strongly promoted the work . In 1937 Townsend made a trip to Japan coinciding with the release of the book 's Japanese translation . 
 = = Advocate of non @-@ interventionism , 1937 – 41 = = 
 After returning from Japan , Townsend , who described himself as a " conservative " , was highly active in writing articles , delivering lectures , and making radio broadcasts in support of the movement to keep the United States out of the conflicts in Asia and Europe . In explaining the reason for his participation in the pro @-@ neutrality movement , Townsend stated that while serving as a consul abroad he had " learned enough of the rottenness of international politics ... to wish to do my part of peace for this country . " 
 Claiming that publishers would no longer accept anti @-@ interventionist books , Townsend began self @-@ publishing pamphlets . Between 1938 and 1940 he wrote a series of pamphlets which were extremely popular and widely circulated among anti @-@ interventionists . Two of them , The High Cost of Hate and America Has No Enemies In Asia , had a circulation of at least 60 @,@ 000 copies , while another , There Is No Halfway Neutrality printed 30 @,@ 000 copies . The last pamphlet in the series , Seeking Foreign Trouble , attracted the attention of the German embassy in Washington DC which bought and distributed more than 500 copies of it . 
 In his pamphlets , Townsend speaks out against boycotting products from Japan , noting that America does considerably more trade with Japan than China and arguing that peaceful trade with Japan and Nazi Germany would serve the interests of American workers and consumers . He blames " red elements " within China for starting the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War , but praises Japan for the " humane " manner in which its armed forces have behaved in China , believing that it is only the Soviet Union and " a powerful minority " of pro @-@ communist Americans who are conspiring to push America to war with Japan . Townsend predicts that if the Chinese won their war with Japan , the result would be a communist takeover of China , but he dismisses the idea that Japan might launch an attack on the United States as " simply too idiotic to discuss . " On Europe he avers similarly that German conduct is largely a defensive reaction to British and French attempts to " obliterate the Germans as an entity " . 
 Townsend became an active member of America First after its formation in 1940 , and was invited to speak at America First meetings on at least two occasions . Townsend , however , would appear as a private citizen when he came before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on 8 February 1941 in opposition to the Lend @-@ Lease Act . In a widely publicized testimony , Townsend condemned the legislation as tantamount to " a war bill " that would " assign dictatorial powers to the President " and would " make America the unmistakable aggressor against nations which have not sought objectively to molest us . " 
 Townsend 's defense of Germany and Japan led him to be labelled as an " agent " and a " propagandist " by his opponents , charges which Townsend denied . His activism brought him to the attention of George Teeple Eggleston , editor of Scribner 's Commentator , an anti @-@ interventionist magazine based in Lake Geneva , Wisconsin , and in June 1941 Townsend accepted an offer to move to Lake Geneva to serve as a contributor to the magazine . Shortly after Townsend became an assistant editor of The Herald , a virulently anti @-@ Semitic weekly newspaper which the owners of Scribner 's Commentator launched that August . 
 = = Arrest and imprisonment , 1941 – 44 = = 
 Townsend 's first run @-@ in with the law occurred on 25 November 1941 when federal prosecutors investigating German @-@ funded propaganda in the United States sought him to answer questions before a grand jury about Scribner 's Commentator . When he could not be found at his home in Lake Geneva a nationwide manhunt was launched , but three weeks later Townsend came forward willingly , claiming he had simply been on vacation in the southern United States and hadn 't known he was wanted by the government . On 15 December he stated that he had no knowledge about how Scribner 's Commentator was financed , but had strong confidence in the magazine 's owners who he knew to be " good Americans . " He added that although he had worked to prevent the outbreak of a conflict , he was now fully supportive of the US war effort . It emerged later that Nazi German agents had been surreptitiously bankrolling the magazine . 
 On 28 January 1942 , FBI agents arrived at Townsend 's home and arrested him for having acted as a Japanese agent without registering under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 . A federal investigation into Japanese propaganda which had begun in November 1941 discovered that Townsend had received payments from the Japanese Committee on Trade and Information , a Japanese propaganda organization which had existed between 1937 and 1940 . Though Townsend denied being a paid Japanese agent and claimed to be a victim of political persecution , he did admit to having accepting money from the Committee , stating that it was merely a payment in exchange for the bulk sale of his pamphlets . Even so , Townsend opted to plead guilty on 27 March and argued for a lenient sentence on the grounds that he was not aware that his acts were illegal . Townsend also solicited the support of anti @-@ interventionist politicians and he was sent favorable character references by both former Senator Rush D. Holt and his longtime friend Senator Gerald Nye , the latter of whom described Townsend as " a loyal and patriotic American citizen " . The presiding justice T. Alan Goldsborough was , however , unmoved , and deeming his crimes " repulsive , obscene and macabre " , Townsend was sentenced on 12 June to between 8 and 24 months in prison and was incarcerated in Washington DC . 
 = = = Defendant in the Great Sedition Trial = = = 
 Townsend became a defendant during his prison term in what would become known as the " Great Sedition Trial " . The trial arose from Roosevelt 's conviction , against advice from his Attorney @-@ General Francis Biddle , that the most vocal in defending Nazi Germany be tried for subversion . On 23 July 1942 Townsend and 27 other Americans were charged under the Smith Act and the Espionage Act with having participated in a German @-@ backed conspiracy to publish seditious literature seeking to undermine the morale of members of the United States military . The indictment cited the following statement of Townsend 's , which he had written in 1941 prior to US entry into the war , as proof that he had committed sedition : 
 With a fifth of the earth 's people kept under their rule by force , [ the British ] bleat of fighting to liberate subject populations . Fighting now for the triumph of the bloodiest dictatorship ever known – Soviet Russia – they microphone to listening Americans their pious horror of dictatorships . 
 Townsend was arraigned on 20 August , but strongly questioned the view that his writings were subversive as well as the legal foundations of the charges . Along with the other defendants , Townsend was as before strongly defended by senators with anti @-@ interventionist sympathies , including Gerald Nye who said the defendants were no more guilty of sedition than he had been for speaking out against intervening in the war . In fact there were from the beginning many concerns even within the US government about the validity of the proceedings and their constitutionality as no clear evidence had yet been uncovered to demonstrate that the defendants were in collusion with Nazi Germany or with each other . 
 These problems lead to repeated delays in the formal opening of the trial and the indictment had to be laid down a second time on 4 January 1943 after the first had expired . More delays arose , however , and when the indictment was laid down for a third time on 3 January 1944 , Townsend 's name had been dropped from the list . Although Francis Biddle initially said that Townsend would still be subject to prosecution in the future , in the end no further actions were taken . By then Townsend had was bankrupted by legal costs and was deserted by most of his friends . Biddle himself later called the sedition case " a dreary farce " . 
 At the time The Washington Post reported that before the war Townsend had accepted money from an individual connected to German agents in in return for circulating anti @-@ British pamphlets . Despite all this Townsend still insisted that , " I was never anybody 's foreign agent . All I published was independently written and 100 per cent American " , a stance which he maintained for the remainder of his life . 
 = = Post @-@ war life , 1945 – 76 = = 
 In the early @-@ 1950s Townsend moved to Fairfax , Virginia and by the time of his death was considered a " prominent resident " . He helped organize the Fairfax Chamber of Commerce , of which he was the executive director , and in this capacity played a leading role in lobbying the CIA to locate its headquarters in Virginia . He also worked in advance of conservation . In 1967 he appeared before the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs as a member of Defenders of Wildlife and between 1972 and 1976 served on that organization 's board of directors where he was known for " his insistence on sound financial management . " 
 Townsend maintained friendships with far @-@ right figures after the war , including Harry Elmer Barnes and Willis Carto , and for a time he worked as an editor and contributor to Carto 's anti @-@ Semitic magazine , The American Mercury , which introduced Townsend as " a former Foreign Service officer who made the mistake of fighting FDR 's war plans " . Townsend died in Fairfax on 25 January 1976 at the age of 75 . 
 = = Legacy and assessment = = 
 Historians have noted the stridency with which Townsend put forward his pro @-@ Japanese views before World War II . Justus Doenecke , for instance , described Townsend as " The most adamant and extreme of the voices in America defending Japanese policy . " Judith <unk> concurs that " Few anti @-@ imperialists were as extreme as isolationist Ralph Townsend " , though Townsend himself rejected the " isolationist " label during his life , and instead called himself a " realist " and " Pro @-@ Peace " . 
 Townsend is still held in esteem by many members of the extreme right in the United States , and recently in Japan as well . After his death his widow Janet turned over his papers to Larry Humphreys , an Oklahoma multimillionaire and supporter of right @-@ wing militia and Christian Identity groups , who referred to Townsend as a man who " knew FDR was trying to entice Japan into attacking the United States , and FDR had him jailed " . Humphreys stored Townsend 's papers in his so @-@ called " Heritage Library " , though today many of them are held by Barnes Review , an anti @-@ Semitic organization under the leadership of Townsend 's old friend Willis Carto . In 1997 , Barnes Review re @-@ published Ways That Are Dark : The Truth About China for the first time since World War II with a new foreword written by Carto , who praised Townsend as " a profound , genuinely courageous and painfully honest writer " . In 2004 a Japanese translation of the Barnes Review edition of Ways That Are Dark was released in Japan where it became a runaway success and quickly elevated Townsend to " hero " status among the Japanese far right . 
 The opinion of recent scholars on the quality of his writing have been mixed . <unk> Chu , who analyzed his articles on China for the Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine , considered some of the claims as " either incredibly gullible or deliberately vicious " , while historian Justus Doenecke described his pamphlets as " crudely written " . In contrast , Peter O 'Connor , professor at Musashino University , found the same pamphlets " well @-@ argued and researched . "

 Lisa 's teacher , Miss Hoover , thinks she has come down with Lyme disease and is replaced by substitute teacher Mr. Bergstrom . Because of his unorthodox teaching methods and friendly nature , Lisa starts falling in love with him . 
 Lisa runs into Mr. Bergstrom at a museum and is embarrassed when Homer displays his ignorance . Sensing a void in their relationship , Mr. Bergstrom takes Homer aside to suggest he be a more positive role model . After venting to her mother about Homer ruining her ' one chance ' to get to know Bergstrom outside of the classroom , Lisa is given permission to invite him to family dinner , only to be shattered when she finds Miss Hoover back and Mr. Bergstrom gone . She rushes to his apartment and learns that he has accepted employment in " Capital City " . She rushes to the train station to catch him , and confesses that she will be lost without him ; he replies and she <unk> accepts that he has to go help the more needy . To comfort her , he writes her a note and tells her that any time she feels alone , its contents are all she needs to know . He then boards the train and departs . It reads , " You are Lisa Simpson " . 
 In a subplot , Bart 's class prepares to elect a class president . Mrs. Krabappel nominates Martin , while Sherri and Terri nominate Bart. During a debate with Martin , Bart tells jokes and wins the class over . Afterwards , certain of Bart 's inevitable victory thanks to his popular campaigning , none of the children in his class — including himself — actually voted , giving Martin the victory with just two votes : one from himself , and the other from Wendell <unk> . 
 Devastated by Mr. Bergstrom 's departure , Lisa takes her grief out on the insensitive Homer , calling him a baboon . Marge tells Homer to console Lisa , explaining how her daughter is very hurt emotionally and is in need of her father . Homer enters Lisa 's room and finds her crying over her desk . He is uncertain of how to deal with Lisa 's sadness , and is uncomfortable seeing his daughter crying . Homer explains to Lisa how he cannot really understand how it feels to lose someone special : everyone he has ever loved and cared about lives with him still . He then alludes to Lisa calling him a baboon , and in a loving manner mimics a monkey , cheering her up . Lisa apologizes to Homer for calling him a baboon , and he accepts the apology . Finding Bart still seething over the election result , Homer cheers him up by reminding him that all the job of class president would have really meant was a lot of extra work with little reward , making Bart feel happy that he lost the election . Finally going by Maggie 's room , he places her pacifier in her mouth . Proud that he helped all three of his children , Homer goes to bed with Marge happily that night , stating he is " on the biggest roll " of his life . 
 = = Production = = 
 The episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Rich Moore . According to Vitti , The Simpsons producer James L. Brooks contributed more to this episode than he did to any other in the show 's history . Vitti said the episode was " very controversial " when it was being made because it " came at a point when the staff were just beginning to realize the comedy potential of the show , but we were trapped with these love stories , and just as the staff were starting to get frustrated with the love stories , along came ' Lisa 's Substitute ' : the biggest , <unk> , warmest and <unk> of them all . " 
 Mr. Bergstrom was modeled on the physical appearance of Mike Reiss , a longtime writer and producer on the show . American actor Dustin Hoffman provided the voice of Mr. Bergstrom . Hoffman was not sure if he wanted to be identified with a cartoon show at the time , like many early guest stars on The Simpsons , and therefore used the pseudonym Sam Etic in the closing credits . Sam Etic is a play on the word semitic , alluding to the fact that both Hoffman and Mr. Bergstrom are Jewish . Brooks was the one who suggested the pseudonym , which Hoffman immediately liked . The cast of the show flew to New York to record the episode with Hoffman . Yeardley Smith , who provides the voice of Lisa , said she grew as an actress after working with Hoffman that day . The Simpsons writer Al Jean said he remembered that when the audio track of the episode came back , Hoffman 's voice was too low on the singing parts . The staff were " petrified " that the singing scenes would not show up on air , so they had Hoffman re @-@ record them when he was in Los Angeles . Vitti mentioned on Twitter that the note Lisa receives at the end of the episode should 've had an exclamation point at the end . He didn 't catch it in the animatic and it still " haunts [ him ] to this day " . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Mrs. Krabappel trying to seduce Mr. Bergstrom is a reference to Hoffman 's similar situation in the 1967 film The Graduate . Mr. Bergstrom reads a line from the 1952 novel Charlotte 's Web to his class . It is implied that this line is the end of the book , but in reality another chapter follows . Vitti said the line was the maximum amount of the book they could feature in the episode without being sued . The staff contacted a relative of the author E. B. White , but she would not clear the use of the book . When Lisa arrives at Mr. Bergstrom 's apartment building , a list of tenants can be seen . One of the names is J. Vitti , for the episode 's writer Jon Vitti , and another is J. Kamerman , for then @-@ animator Jen Kamerman . When Bart unexpectedly loses to Martin in the class president race , a picture of Martin holding up a copy of The Daily Fourth <unk> with the headline " Simpson Defeats Prince " is taken , which in turn ends up on the front page of The Daily Fourth <unk> under the headline " Prince Beats Simpson " . This is a reference to the famous picture of former President Harry Truman holding up a copy of a prematurely printed edition of the Chicago Tribune that proclaimed " Dewey Defeats Truman " , taken the day after his close victory over Thomas E. Dewey in the 1948 United States presidential election .

Mr Bergstrom 's last message for Lisa is a delightful touch and adds the finishing touch to a wonderful episode . " Former TV Squad blogger Adam Finley named " Lisa 's Substitute " as one of his top fourteen most touching The Simpsons episodes , and The Simpsons Archive webmaster <unk> <unk> rated the episode as his third favorite . Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said that Lisa episodes " tend to be goopy " , but " Lisa 's Substitute " seemed like " a good show , however " . He went on to say , " The show offered many other good moments , and it helped expand the Lisa / Homer relationship neatly . The Bart ’ s election subplot punctured any sappiness that otherwise might have occurred . [ ... ] ' Lisa 's Substitute ' offered a fairly solid program . " The episode 's reference to The Graduate was named the 20th greatest film reference in the history of the show by Total Film 's Nathan Ditum . Ditum also ranked Hoffman 's performance as the 16th best guest appearance in the show 's history . Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine picked the episode as the show 's second best , praising its emotion and Hoffman 's performance .

 = Madonna : Like an Icon = 
 Madonna : Like an Icon is a biography by English author Lucy O 'Brien , chronicling the life of American singer Madonna . The book was released on 27 August 2007 , by Bantam Press in the United Kingdom , and on 18 October 2007 , by Harper Collins in the United States . Madonna : Like an Icon chronicles the life of the singer from her birth , up to the release of her eleventh studio album , Hard Candy , in 2008 . Initially critical of her work , O 'Brien had become a fan of Madonna after seeing her perform on television for The Virgin Tour in 1985 . From that point of time , the author followed Madonna 's career closely , visited her concert tours , and collected interviews , magazines , and albums . 
 When O 'Brien finally decided to write a biography on Madonna in 2005 , she wanted the book to be more about the singer 's contribution to her music , rather than delving too much into her personal life , unlike other Madonna biographers . The author then interviewed dancers , choreographers , musicians , and producers who worked with Madonna . After its release , the book received a mixed response from critics . They were unanimous that the over @-@ emphasis given on the singer 's discography was unnecessary , instead more thought should have been given on exploring her personal life , which would have made the biography compelling . 
 = = Summary = = 
 The biography is divided into three parts . The first part is named " Baptism " and tells about Madonna 's birth in Detroit , Michigan , her early childhood , her time in New York , and her dance degree . It also talks in detail about the release of her first three studio albums — Madonna , Like a Virgin and True Blue — her marriage to actor Sean Penn , and also her foray into films . The middle part , named " Confession " , starts from the Like a Prayer era onwards where Madonna has become a global superstar . It continues up to the release of the erotic coffee table book called Sex , and the subsequent commercial disappointments that she faced . The third part is called " Absolution " , and starts with Madonna giving birth to her daughter Lourdes . It continues with the release of Ray of Light ( 1998 ) and subsequent four studio albums , her worldwide concert tours , her marriage to Guy Ritchie and controversies surrounding her adoption from Malawi . It ends with the release of Madonna 's 2008 album , Hard Candy , and the singer reaching the age of fifty . 
 = = Background and writing = = 
 Lucy O 'Brien first came to like Madonna in 1985 , when she saw the singer on television , performing on The Virgin Tour . She previously thought that Madonna " was that cheesy pop bimbo in lycra , writhing on a Venetian gondola for the ' Like a Virgin ' video . " However , The Virgin Tour changed her opinion and by the time Madonna 's 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan was released , O 'Brien confessed that Madonna had won her admiration . The author had admired Madonna 's lack of fear , and her ability to incorporate alternative culture and sexuality in her work . 
 In 2005 , O 'Brien started writing a book on Madonna , where she wanted to look at her life and work , as the artist was approaching the age of fifty . She believed that the general public was eager to know the real @-@ self of Madonna , and she concentrated on finding that out . According to her , " the popular negative stereotype about the artist is that of a publicity @-@ hungry , manipulative ball @-@ breaker , while for many woman she is a beacon of feminism . I have always found her work clear and autobiographical , but her personality complex and disarmingly changeable . " She also said of the singer : 
 " Madonna 's style is confrontational , her ambition unbounded , yet she constantly , compulsively turns her life into fascinating pop art . As her old boyfriend , producer Steve Bray , said : ' Her most effective trait was to have her completely dominate you and for you to somehow enjoy the experience . ' Madonna has become a goddess of our age , and an icon that we have all created . That is her story . " 
 However , due to the shifting images that Madonna presented , O 'Brien was confused as to how she can approach writing the biography . She found that analyzing Madonna 's music was a helpful method . The author then interviewed dancers , choreographers , musicians , and producers who worked with Madonna . While talking to them , O 'Brien reflected on her own childhood and found parallels with Madonna — being born in a Catholic family and gradually becoming aware of the rise of feminism and gay liberation . She kept getting two stark pictures of the artist as her " search for Madonna became maddening " , stating " There was the woman who was ruthless in moving on and rude to the competition , and there was a woman I 'd never seen before – sweet , childlike and captivating . "

 Madonna : Like an Icon was released on 27 August 2007 , in the United Kingdom by Bantam Press . The book cover was designed by Holly MacDonald , with an image of Madonna from 2002 , during the premiere of her film , Swept Away . It was released more than a year later in the United States . The biography faced mixed reviews from critics . Sarah Churchwell from The Guardian criticized O 'Brien 's extended commentary about Madonna 's recording process . She believed that more emphasis should have been given on Madonna 's personal life as well . Pointing out examples like Madonna 's relationship with actor Warren Beatty , which was widely covered in the media but was only lightly touched in the book , Churchwell wondered about the claim of the book in its press release : " This is the closest you will ever come to Madonna 's autobiography " . The reviewer concluded by saying , " Since her voice is nowhere in evidence , this book , however capable and intelligent its writer , is probably about the farthest you will ever get from Madonna 's autobiography . " 
 Ken Barnes from USA Today noted that major events in Madonna 's life were repeated throughout the book . He complimented O 'Brien 's writing style , especially the portions chronicling the death of Madonna 's mother , as well as dissecting the recording process of the albums and the development of her concert tours . He concluded by saying that overall the biography seemed " too familiar . Maybe that 's because , at least since she hit the mass @-@ culture spotlight in 1983 with ' Holiday ' and hijacked it wholesale the next year with ' Like a Virgin ' and ' Material Girl ' , Madonna , now 49 , has lived her life in public like few other artists . The records , tours and videos have been thoroughly documented , as have the liaisons and the controversies ( from the Sex book all the way up to the Malawi orphan adoption ) . " Lyn Barber from The Daily Telegraph gave a negative review of the book , calling it far inferior to author J. Randy Taraborrelli 's Madonna : An Intimate Biography , released in 2002 . Like Churchwell , Barber did not understand why over @-@ emphasis was given on the singer 's albums , leaving out details about her personal life . The reviewer listed one positive aspect of the book , the info on Madonna 's childhood and a detailed insight into her family . She concluded by saying , " [ Madonna ] remains one of the most fascinating women of our time but not , alas , in this pedestrian account . "

 = Ann Bannon = 
 Ann Bannon ( pseudonym of Ann Weldy , born September 15 , 1932 ) is an American author who , from 1957 to 1962 , wrote six lesbian pulp fiction novels known as The Beebo Brinker Chronicles . The books ' enduring popularity and impact on lesbian identity has earned her the title " Queen of Lesbian Pulp Fiction " . Bannon was a young housewife trying to address her own issues of sexuality when she was inspired to write her first novel . Her subsequent books featured four characters who reappeared throughout the series , including her eponymous heroine , Beebo Brinker , who came to embody the archetype of a butch lesbian . The majority of her characters mirrored people she knew , but their stories reflected a life she did not feel she was able to live . Despite her traditional upbringing and role in married life , her novels defied conventions for romance stories and depictions of lesbians by addressing complex homosexual relationships . 
 Her books shaped lesbian identity for lesbians and heterosexuals alike , but Bannon was mostly unaware of their impact . She stopped writing in 1962 . Later , she earned a doctorate in linguistics and became an academic . She endured a difficult marriage for 27 years and , as she separated from her husband in the 1980s , her books were republished ; she was stunned to learn of their influence on society . They were released again between 2001 and 2003 and were adapted as an award @-@ winning Off @-@ Broadway production . They are taught in Women 's and LGBT studies courses , and Bannon has received numerous awards for pioneering lesbian and gay literature . She has been described as " the premier fictional representation of US lesbian life in the fifties and sixties " , and it has been said that her books " rest on the bookshelf of nearly every even faintly literate Lesbian " . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Ann Bannon was born Ann Weldy in Joliet , Illinois , in 1932 . She grew up in nearby Hinsdale with her mother and stepfather , and had the responsibility of taking care of four siblings due to the family 's financial problems . She took comfort in a vibrant imaginary life during this time and found solace in writing . Growing up , she was surrounded by music , particularly jazz , as her family hosted small recitals for friends and neighbors . One became a character in her books : a perennial bachelor named Jack who slung jokes and witticisms at the audiences . 
 At the University of Illinois at Urbana – Champaign she belonged to Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority where she befriended a beautiful older sorority sister , " the prettiest I had ever seen " , quite popular with men and with women . Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister 's unabashed infatuation with the older sister . She recalls it was an awkward situation , even though the older sorority sister was " unfailingly gracious " to the younger one . In recognizing the younger woman 's attractions , she began to suspect her own sexuality . She said , " I saw a lot of it happening and I didn 't know what to make of it . I don 't even know how to put it — I was absolutely consumed with it , it was an extraordinary thing . " Another sorority sister was physically remarkable , very tall — almost 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) , with a husky voice and boyish nickname , that Bannon imagined was a blend of Johnny Weissmuller and Ingrid Bergman . She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister , " both of us in underwear , and <unk> ( ing ) a sort of electric shock " , and trying not to stare at her . In 1954 , she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently . 
 Bannon was 22 years old when she began writing her first pulp novel . She was influenced by the only lesbian novels she had read , The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall from 1928 and Vin Packer 's Spring Fire from 1952 , albeit in two different ways : she was unable to relate to the dismal tones in Hall 's novel , but as a sorority girl was more familiar with the plot and circumstances of Spring Fire . Bannon said , " Both books completely obsessed me for the better part of two years . " Although recently married and on her way to having two children , she found the books struck a chord in her life and recognized emotions in herself that compelled her to write about them . In the beginning of her marriage she was left alone quite a lot and said , " I was kind of desperate to get some of the things that had been consuming me for a long time down on paper . "

 Paperback books in the United States expanded prominently after World War II through the marketing strategies of Pocket Books , who began to distribute publications through newspapers , newsstands , grocery stores , and bus and train stations . The retail opportunities of paperback books grew about tenfold with this method . In 1950 , rival company Gold Medal Books published Women 's Barracks , a fictionalized account of author <unk> Torres ' experience serving in the Free French Forces . The book depicts a lesbian relationship the author witnessed , ending with one of the women committing suicide . It sold 4 @.@ 5 million copies , and Gold Medal Books ' editors were " thrilled " . Its success earned it a mention in the House Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials in 1952 . Gold Medal Books was a branch of Fawcett Publications that focused on paperback books which at the time were printed on very cheap paper , not designed to last for more than a year , sold for 25 cents in drug stores and other venues all over the United States and Canada . The books made for cheap , easy reading that could be discarded at the end of a trip at very little cost to the customer . Because of the low quality of production , they earned the name pulp fiction . 
 Gold Medal Books quickly followed Women 's Barracks with Spring Fire , eager to cash in on the unprecedented sales , and it sold almost 1 @.@ 5 million copies in 1952 . Vin Packer , whose real name is Marijane Meaker , and Gold Medal Books were overwhelmed with mail from women who identified with the lesbian characters . 
 One of the letters was from Bannon , asking for professional assistance in getting published . On writing to Meaker , she said , " To this day I have no idea why she responded to me out of the thousands of letters she was getting at that time . Thank God she did . I was both thrilled and terrified . " Bannon visited Meaker and was introduced to Greenwich Village , which made a significant impression on Bannon : she called it " Emerald City , Wonderland , and Brigadoon combined — a place where gay people could walk the crooked streets hand in hand . " Meaker set up a meeting with Gold Medal Books editor Dick Carroll , who read Bannon 's initial 600 @-@ page manuscript . It was a story about the women in her sorority whom she admired , with a subplot consisting of two sorority sisters who had fallen in love with each other . Carroll told her to take it back and focus on the two characters who had an affair . Bannon claims she went back and told their story , delivered the draft to Carroll and saw it published without a single word changed . While raising two young children , Bannon lived in Philadelphia and took trips into New York City to visit Greenwich Village and stayed with friends . She said of the women she saw in Greenwich Village , " I wanted to be one of them , to speak to other women , if only in print . And so I made a beginning — and that beginning was the story that became Odd Girl Out . "

 = = = = Odd Girl Out = = = = 
 The Beebo Brinker Chronicles are six books in all , first published between 1957 and 1962 . They featured four characters who appeared in at least three of the books in a chronological saga of coming to terms with their homosexuality and navigating their ways through gay and lesbian relationships . The first in the series , Odd Girl Out , was published in 1957 , and became Gold Medal Books ' second best @-@ selling title of the year . Based on Bannon 's own experiences , the plot involved a lesbian relationship between two sorority sisters in a fictional sorority at a fictional midwestern university . As was custom with pulp fiction novels , neither the cover art nor the title were under the control of the author . Both were approved by the publisher in order to be as suggestive and lurid as possible . The main character is Laura Landon , who realizes that she 's in love with Beth , her older , more experienced roommate , a leader in the sorority . 
 Lesbians depicted in literature were relatively rare in the 1950s . It was the publisher 's policy in any novel involving lesbianism that the characters would never receive any satisfaction from the relationship . One or both usually ended up committing suicide , going insane , or leaving the relationship . Marijane Meaker discusses this in the 2004 foreword of Spring Fire : she was told by editor Dick Carroll that because the books were distributed by the U.S. Post Office instead of private companies delivering directly to stores , postal inspectors would send the books back to the publisher if homosexuality was depicted positively . The Postal Service relaxed their censorship after several First Amendment obscenity trials , including Roth v. United States and another regarding Allen Ginsberg 's Howl in the mid @-@ 1950s , which gave Bannon a modicum of freedom in her plots . Although the ending to Odd Girl Out did not veer too far from the unsatisfactory resolution formula of Spring Fire , Women 's Barracks , and Radclyffe Hall 's The Well of Loneliness , it examined Laura 's internal struggle in the realization that despite her femininity , she was deeply in love with another woman , and at the end she embraced it , which was rare in lesbian fiction . 
 The characters and their stories served as an extension of the fantasy life Bannon developed as a child . They became her " fantasy friends " whose loves and lives she witnessed and through which she lived her own life vicariously , helping her through a difficult marriage , and a longing for a life she did not feel she was free to live . " I realized very early that I should not marry , but I was going to make the best of a bad thing , and I was going to make it a good thing , " she remembered . Having no practical experience in a lesbian relationship while writing Odd Girl Out , she set out to gain what she termed " fieldwork experience " in her trips to Greenwich Village , and was successful enough to introduce those experiences into the next book in the series before relocating once more to Southern California . But she explained her fears about staying in Greenwich Village , saying 
 I would sit there ( in a gay bar ) in the evenings thinking , ' What if ( a police raid ) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the slam with all these other women ? ' I had been extremely low profile , very proper , very Victorian wife . I know that sounds crazy in the 60s , but I was raised by my mother and grandmother , who really came out of that era , and talk about a rigid role @-@ playing crowd ! I couldn 't imagine living through it . I just couldn 't . I thought , ' Well , that would do it . I 'd have to go jump off the Brooklyn Bridge . ' As easy as it might be if you were a young woman in today 's generation to think that was exaggerating , it wasn 't . It was terrifying . 
 = = = = I Am a Woman = = = = 
 Bannon followed Odd Girl Out with I Am a Woman ( In Love With a Woman — Must Society Reject Me ? ) in 1959 . I Am a Woman ( the working and common title ) featured Laura after her affair with Beth , as she finds herself in New York City 's Greenwich Village , and meets a wisecracking gay man named Jack , and becomes his best friend . Laura has to choose between a straight woman with a wild and curious streak , and a fascinating new character that proved to be her most popular of the series , Beebo Brinker , who came to embody the description of a thoroughly butch lesbian . Beebo was smart , handsome , chivalrous , and virile . Once again based on what Bannon knew , Beebo was nearly 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) tall with a husky voice and a formidable physique . The personality however , Bannon says , was drawn out of her sheer need for Beebo to exist . After spending time in Greenwich Village and not finding anyone like her , Bannon instead created her . She remembered , " I put Beebo together just as I wanted her , in my heart and mind ... She was just , quite literally , the butch of my dreams . " The resolution to I Am a Woman completely flouted the trends of miserable lesbian fiction endings , which made Ann Bannon a hero to many lesbians . 
 Letters began to pour in for her from all over the country . There were mostly propositions from men , but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for reassurance that they would be all right . Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns : " The most important things they learned ( from the books ) were that 1 ) they weren 't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation , 2 ) ... they weren 't ' abnormal , ' and 3 ) there was hope for a happy life . They wrote to me in thousands , asking me to confirm these wonderful things , which I gladly did — even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were . " The books were even translated into other languages , which was also quite rare for the brief lives of pulp novels . Bannon received international and domestic mail from women , saying , " This is the only book ( and they would say this about all of them ) that I 've read where the women really love each other , where its OK for them to love each other , and they don 't have to kill themselves afterwards . " 
 = = = = Women in the Shadows = = = = 
 Although her husband was aware of the books she was writing , he showed no interest in the subject . He was interested enough in the money she made from them , however , but had forbidden her to use her married surname , not wishing to see it on a book cover with art of questionable taste . She took the name " Bannon " from a list of his customers and liked it because it contained her own name in it . She continued to experience difficulty in her marriage , however , and in realizing that " not all lesbians were nice people " , she took these frustrations out on her characters . " I couldn 't stand some of what was happening to me – but Beebo could take it . Beebo really , in a way , had my nervous breakdown for me ... I think I was overwhelmed with grief and anger that I was not able to express , " she recalled later . Women in the Shadows was also published in 1959 and proved very unpopular with Bannon 's readers . The book examined interracial relationships , self @-@ loathing in matters of sexuality and race , alcoholism , jealousy , violence , and as Laura marries Jack in an atypical arrangement in the 1950s , also explored the intricate details of what it was like to pass as heterosexual in an attempt to live some semblance of what was considered a normal life at the time . 
 = = = = Journey to a Woman = = = = 
 Her fourth book in the series , Journey to a Woman , published in 1960 , again shows parallels between Bannon 's own life and her plots . Beth , of Laura 's affair in Odd Girl Out , is living with her husband and children in Southern California . She tries to find Laura again nine years after college , and escapes a deranged woman who has a fixation on her , a reflection of a relationship Bannon had with a beautiful , but " very bewildered and unstable person . " Beth writes to an author of lesbian books in New York , and goes to meet her in hope of finding Laura . They have a brief relationship , after which Beth finds Laura married to Jack and with a child , then discovers Beebo as well . A fifth book , The Marriage , also published in 1960 , again addresses issues of love outside the realm of socially acceptable relationships , although it is not primarily about homosexuality . In it , Jack and Laura are friends with a young married couple who discover they are brother and sister , and must decide whether they will stay together or conform to societal standards . 
 = = = = Beebo Brinker = = = = 
 Returning to the character she fantasized about the most , the last book in the series , Beebo Brinker , published in 1962 , was Bannon 's prequel to Odd Girl Out . It follows Beebo around Greenwich Village ten years before she meets Laura in I Am a Woman . Beebo gets off the bus from her rural hometown into New York City to find a waiting friend in Jack , and to discover herself . She begins an affair with a famous and fading movie star , and follows her to California , only to return to be more honest about what she wants in her life . 
 In 1961 and 1962 Bannon also contributed several articles to ONE , Inc . , the magazine of a homophile activist organization in Southern California . One of them was a chapter that had been cut from the final draft of Women in the Shadows . She was invited to speak to the Mattachine Society in the early 1960s , but her husband 's stern disapproval of her activities began to take its toll . She stated later , " It began to be very painful . So every time I would start to reach out ( to the lesbian / gay community ) , I would get struck down ... In my own life , I couldn 't <unk> ( my feeling that gays should end the secrecy and take more pride in themselves and their lives ) . I couldn 't find a way . " 
 = = Rediscovery = = 
 After Beebo Brinker , Bannon said the energy to write about the characters left her , but she got so good at her " obsessive fantasies " that even after the books were written she continued to live internally , and suspected it affected her subsequent relationships . " I realize now that I was in a sort of ' holding pattern , ' a way of keeping my sanity intact while waiting for my children to grow up and the freedom door to open " , she recalled . Returning to school , Bannon completed her master 's degree at Sacramento State University and her doctorate in linguistics at Stanford University . She was an English professor at Sacramento State and later became associate dean of the School of Arts and Sciences — later the College of Arts and Letters . 
 Ann Bannon 's books began to fade away from publishing memory after initial publication , especially after Gold Medal Books went out of business . In 1975 , however , Bannon was asked to include four of her books in Arno Press 's library edition of Homosexuality : Lesbians and Gay Men in Society , History and Literature . Then , in 1983 , Barbara Grier of the lesbian publishing company Naiad Press actively tracked Bannon down and reissued the books in new covers . Grier discussed the novels , answering the question of who among lesbian paperback authors should be highlighted : " Ann Bannon . Without even a discussion ... In terms of actual influence , sales , everything , Bannon . " 
 Bannon did not outwardly advertise the fact that the books had been released again in her department at Sacramento State . Not being tenured , she was unsure how the information would be received . However , word got out : " I was jet @-@ propelled out of the closet . People stared at me around campus , and the PE majors all waved . My chairman told me to put the books into my promotion file , and one of my colleagues told me my file was the only one that was any fun . " She often received small recognitions from students and faculty who were pleased and surprised , once getting a bouquet of flowers from a student . She said of the rediscovery , " I was so ready for something fresh and exciting in my life . It had seemed to me , up to that point , that not only had the books and the characters died , so had Ann Bannon . " However , following a bitter divorce , and just as the Naiad Press editions of her books were released , Bannon endured a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome , which she connects to repressing herself for so long . " You 've got to think that it 's connected , somehow . At the time I denied it fiercely , but I really think I beat myself up horribly , in ways I 'll never know . " 
 In 1984 , Bannon 's books were featured in the documentary Before Stonewall about how gay men and lesbians lived prior to the 1969 Stonewall riots , wherein one woman remembered picking up one of Bannon 's books for the first time : " I picked up this paperback and I opened it up ... and it sent a shiver of excitement in my whole body that I had never felt before . " She was featured in the Canadian documentary Forbidden Love : The Unashamed Stories of Lesbian Lives in 1992 , which recounted women 's personal stories of living as lesbians from the 1940s to 1960s . The books were selected for the Quality Paperback Book Club in 1995 . Bannon also provided the foreword for Strange Sisters : The Art of Lesbian Pulp Fiction 1949 – 1969 in 1999 , discussing her reaction to the artwork on her own books and the other lesbian pulp fiction books she bought and read . Five of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles were reissued by <unk> Press again between 2001 and 2003 — excluding The Marriage — with autobiographical forewords that described Bannon 's experiences of writing the books and her reaction to their popularity , causing another wave of interest . 
 Reacting to the renewed interest in the books , Bannon wrote in the 2002 introduction to Odd Girl Out that she was shocked to find out that her characters were not only remembered but that they were archetypes among the lesbian community . The books are frequently on required reading lists for Women 's and LGBT studies college courses . Bannon often admits to being surprised by this , explaining that she had no such aspirations when she was writing Odd Girl Out : " If I had known , it might well have resulted in a much more polished product , but one that would have been so cautious and self @-@ conscious as to be entirely forgettable . It would never — my best guess — have had the vibrant life it has now . "

 = = = Identity = = = 
 Since so little information was available about lesbians and lesbianism at the time , Bannon 's books , through their far @-@ reaching distribution and popularity served to form a part of a lesbian identity not only for the heterosexual population at large , but lesbians themselves . Lesbian author and historian Joan Nestle called the books " survival literature " , explaining : " In whatever towns or cities these books were read , they were spreading the information that meant a new hope for trapped and isolated women " . One retrospective writer noted , " [ U ] <unk> the late 1960s , when the sexual revolution was emerging , the pulps provided a cultural space that helped to forge a queer identity " . 
 Scholar Andrea Loewenstein published the first in @-@ depth review of Bannon 's books in 1980 , and notes that they were " exceptionally good pulp " that caused unexpected strong feelings of sadness or anger among lesbians when they were read twenty years after being published . Bannon depicts strict roles of butch and femme , and gays and lesbians as self @-@ destructive , closeted , paranoid , and alcoholic . Loewenstein remarks that readers in 1980 had a tendency to reject that kind of reality in Bannon 's stories . " Since much of our past is so bitter , [ we ] ... pretend away our most recent history " . Loewenstein suggests the struggles Bannon 's characters endured were ones that Bannon must have faced herself . When Laura declares her joy in her love for Beth in Odd Girl Out while simultaneously questioning if it is right , Loewenstein states " one hears quite clearly the voice of Ann Bannon , questioning her own right to happiness " . Similarly , remarking on Bannon 's treatment of Beebo in Women in the Shadows by making her violent , alcoholic and self @-@ destructive , Loewenstein notes , " she needs to humiliate Beebo so badly that she makes her disappear " . Loewenstein remarks Bannon 's characters are deeply conflicted by enjoying relationships they feel are morally wrong , and they are acting out cycles of self @-@ hatred , though what remains at the end is " surprisingly ... passionate , tender , and erotic " . 
 Writer Diane Hamer attests that Bannon 's books and characters represent a part of identity where women are unsure if they are gay or straight , man or woman , ashamed or accepting of who they are . In receiving no clear answers from Bannon herself , women were left to try to figure these questions out for themselves . Hamer writes , " What Bannon did was to provide a range of possible trajectories to lesbianism ... Bannon , by constructing fictional biographies for her lesbian characters , produced a new knowledge about how one arrives at a lesbian identity . " 
 Bannon also addresses the issue of race in Women in the Shadows when Laura begins an affair with a woman representing herself as Eastern Indian , but who is actually a lighter skinned African American . The duality of their relationship is expressed not only in skin color but through their personalities . Laura , blond and passionate , contrasts with Tris , who is dark but emotionally detached . Race , in this instance , is a " metaphor for the opposition between inside and outside that govern Bannon 's sense of what a lesbian is " . 
 The concept of a lesbian identity is also explored throughout Journey to a Woman , as Beth leaves her husband and children to find Laura . Beth is followed by Vega , a woman scarred deeply — both emotionally and physically — with whom Beth had an affair . Vega shoots herself at the end of the story . Scholar Christopher Nealon suggests that Vega 's scars and emotional pain represent the anguish of self @-@ hatred and the self @-@ destructive phases Bannon imposed upon her characters in Women in the Shadows . Because Laura has grown from the complete adoration of Beth in Odd Girl Out and is unable to give Beth the same devotion when Beth finds her again , Nealon writes that Bannon makes the point that it is impossible to sustain " a lesbian identity that always returns to the moment of self @-@ discovery " . Beth , instead , finds Beebo , now older and much calmer , who gives her hope and the promise of love , which Nealon equates to a final identity for Bannon 's characters . 
 In the new forewords to the <unk> Press editions , Bannon addressed the criticisms of her characters as self @-@ destructive in limiting roles , explaining that she simply depicted what she knew and felt at the time . Bannon has said she knows the concerns of the women who are uncomfortable with the themes of her books : " I can understand that ; they weren 't there . To them some of it looks negative and some of it looks depressing . Although I didn 't feel that way . I always felt excited when I was writing them . " 
 = = = Gender = = = 
 All five books of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles depict characters trying to come to terms with their ostracism from heterosexual society . Christopher Nealon adds that the characters are also trying to " understand the relationship between their bodies and their desires " ; the continuing appeal of the novels , Nealon states , is due to the characters being " beautifully <unk> " . 
 In Odd Girl Out , Laura Landon 's resistance to the idea that she may be homosexual lies in her own concept of femininity rather than any repugnance for loving women . In I Am a Woman , the second book in the series , Beebo 's butch appearance " seems to alternately terrify and attract Laura " , leading to a very erotic physical relationship . However , when Laura lashes out at Beebo in a moment of self @-@ pity , it is her masculinity that Laura attacks , invalidating Beebo 's uniqueness and the core of her desirability violently . In the book that exhibits the most self @-@ destruction in the series , Women in the Shadows , Laura expresses shame when accompanying Beebo outside of Greenwich Village , fearing Beebo will be arrested and jailed . Facing the end of their relationship , Beebo expresses the desire to be a man , if only to be able to marry Laura to give her a normal life . 
 Bannon 's last book , Beebo Brinker , which takes place before the others when Beebo is eighteen years old , focuses on her realization not only that she is gay , but that she is also a masculine woman . Nealon writes that Bannon 's exploration of Beebo 's masculinity is not to give excuses for her desires , but " to get at the source of <unk> , the sources of her claim to be treated with dignity " . By connecting her characters ' bodies with their desires , Bannon allows further understanding of self as normal , and that homosexuality is acceptable . 
 = = Style = = 
 Bannon 's books , like most pulp fiction novels , were not reviewed by newspapers or magazines when they were originally published between 1957 and 1962 . However , since their release they have been the subject of analyses that offer differing opinions of Bannon 's books as a reflection of the moral standards of the decade , a subtle defiance of those morals , or a combination of both . Andrea Loewenstein notes Bannon 's use of cliché , suggesting that it reflected Bannon 's own belief in the culturally repressive ideas of the 1950s . Conversely , writer Jeff Weinstein remarks that Bannon 's " potboilers " are an expression of freedom because they address issues mainstream fiction did not in the 1950s . Instead of cliché , Weinstein writes that her characters become more realistic as she exploits the dramatic plots , because they " are influenced by the melodramatic conventions of the culture that excludes them " . 
 Diane Hamer likens Bannon 's work to the Mills and Boon of lesbian literature , but unlike conventional romance novels , her stories never really have neat and tidy conclusions . Hamer also takes note of Bannon 's use of Freudian symbolism : in I Am a Woman , Jack frequently mentions that he is being <unk> , and his friends react with interest . Jack labels Laura " Mother " and continues to refer to this nickname instead of her real name throughout the series , as though Bannon — through Jack — is vaguely mocking Freud and the ideas that have framed the construction of sexuality in the 1950s . Scholar Michele <unk> remarks that Bannon 's literary devices in Beebo Brinker defy the expectations of the audience for whom the novel was specifically marketed : heterosexual males . Bannon chooses the first character , an " everyman " named — significantly — Jack Mann , with whom the male audience identifies , only to divulge that he is gay and has maternal instincts . His interest turns to Beebo , whom he finds " handsome " and lost , and he takes her home , gets her drunk , and becomes asexually intimate with her . <unk> writes that Bannon manipulates male readers to become interested in the story , then turns them into voyeurs and imposes homosexual desires upon them , though eventually places them in a safe position to understand a gay story from a heterosexual point of view . 
 The erotic nature of the books has been noted as adding to their uniqueness . Loewenstein remarks on the intensity of Laura 's passion : " The presentation of a woman as a joyfully aggressive person is , in itself , a rare achievement in 1957 " . A 2002 retrospective of Bannon 's books claims " there were more explicit and nuanced representations of sexuality in those paperbacks than could be found almost anywhere else " . Author Suzana Danuta Walters represents the eroticism in Bannon 's books as a form of rebellion . In the Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review , Jenifer Levin writes , " Know this : Beebo lives . From the midst of a repressive era , from the pen of a very proper , scholarly , seemingly conforming wife and mother , came this astonishingly open queer figment of fictional being , like molten material from some volcano of the lesbian soul . " 
 Bannon 's books have , with the benefit of time , been described in vastly different terms , from " literary works " among pulp contemporaries , to " <unk> trash " . However disparately Bannon 's books are described in feminist and lesbian literary retrospectives , almost every mention concedes the significance of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles . One retrospective writer called Bannon 's books " titillating trash , but indispensable reading to the nation 's lesbians . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Critics have since remarked that Bannon 's books are remarkable for portraying homosexual relationships relatively accurately . The continuity of characters in the series also gave her books a unique quality , especially when most lesbian characters during this time were one @-@ dimensional stereotypes who met punishment for their desires . Bannon 's characters have been called " accessibly human " , and still engrossing by contemporary standards compared to being " revolutionary " when first released . LGBT historian Susan Stryker describes the relationships between Bannon 's characters as mostly positive , satisfactory , and at times complex depictions of lesbian and gay relationships , which Bannon attributed to not letting go of the hope that she could " salvage ( her ) own life . " One retrospective of lesbian pulp fiction remarked on the reasons why Bannon 's books in particular were popular is because they were so different from anything else being published at the time : " Bannon was implicitly challenging the prevailing belief that homosexual life was brief , episodic , and more often than not resulted in death ... Bannon insisted on the continuity of lesbian love , while everything in her culture was speaking of its quick and ugly demise . " 
 Bannon set her stories in and among gay bars in the 1950s and 1960s that were secret . As described in Beebo Brinker , one had to knock on the door and be recognized before being let in . In reality , women were not allowed to wear pants in some bars in New York City . Police raided bars and arrested everyone within regularly ; a raid on a gay bar prompted the seminal Stonewall riots in 1969 that started the gay rights movement . Because of the atmosphere of secrecy and shame , little was recorded at the time about what it was like to be gay then , and Bannon unwittingly recorded history from her own visits to Greenwich Village . In 2007 , one of the writers who adapted three of the books into a play said of Bannon 's work , " I think she rises above the pulp . She wasn 't trying to write trash . There wasn 't any place for a woman to be writing this kind of material ... But I just think the writing 's transcended its time and its era and its market . " 
 Author Katherine V. Forrest claimed Bannon and her books " are in a class by themselves " and credits Bannon with saving her life , writing in 2005 , " Overwhelming need led me to walk a gauntlet of fear up to the cash register . Fear so intense that I remember nothing more , only that I stumbled out of the store in possession of what I knew I must have , a book as necessary to me as air ... I found it when I was eighteen years old . It opened the door to my soul and told me who I was . " 
 = = = Adaptations = = = 
 In 2007 , an off @-@ off @-@ Broadway company named The Hourglass Group produced an adaptation of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles in a production that ran for a month . The writers used material from I Am a Woman , Women in the Shadows and Journey to a Woman to predominantly positive reviews . It was successful enough to be moved Off Broadway for another ten @-@ week run in 2008 . The play 's writers commented on the difficulty of lesbian @-@ themed works finding financial success . They were tempted to make it more appealing by turning to camp for comedy . However , one of the writers said , " I just felt like , how can you turn these people into a joke ? I mean , these people are real people ! Why would I direct a play where I held the characters in some sort of contempt or felt that they were ridiculous ? We are allowed to do something else besides camp . " The stage adaptation of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles was produced by Lily Tomlin and Jane Wagner , and it won the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ( GLAAD ) Media Award for " fair , accurate , and inclusive " portrayals of gay and lesbian people in New York Theater . In April 2008 , Bannon appeared with the Seattle Women 's Chorus in a performance called " Vixen Fiction " . Bannon read excerpts of her work and discussed the effects of her writing on her own life and the lives of her readers . U.S. cable network HBO has optioned Bannon 's novels for potential development as a series .

 In 1997 , Bannon 's work was included in a collection of authors who had made the deepest impact on the lives and identities of gays and lesbians , titled Particular Voices : Portraits of Gay and Lesbian Writers . In 2000 , the San Francisco Board of Supervisors awarded Bannon a Certificate of Honor " for breaking new ground with works like Odd Girl Out and Women in the Shadows " and for " <unk> ( ing ) lesbian experiences at a time when explicit lesbian subject matter was silenced by government and communities . " In 2004 , Bannon was elected into the Saints and Sinners Literary Festival Hall of Fame . She received the Sacramento State Alumni Association 's Distinguished Faculty Award for 2005 , and received the Trailblazer Award from the Golden Crown Literary Society the same year ; the <unk> created the Ann Bannon <unk> Popular Choice Award .

Bannon also speaks at gay @-@ themed events around the country and is working on her memoirs . 
 In a recent editorial written by Bannon in Curve , she discussed how her books survived despite criticisms by censors , Victorian moralists , and purveyors of literary " snobbery " in writing , " To the persistent surprise of many of us , and of the critics who found us such an easy target years ago , the books by , of and for women found a life of their own . They — and we — may still not be regarded as conventionally acceptable ' nice ' literature , as it were — but I have come to value that historical judgment . We wrote the stories no one else could tell . And in so doing , we captured a slice of life in a particular time and place that still resonates for members of our community . " 
 = Henry Percy , 3rd Earl of Northumberland = 
 Henry Percy , 3rd Earl of Northumberland , ( 25 July 1421 – 29 March 1461 ) was an English magnate . 
 The Earldom of Northumberland was one of the greatest fifteenth @-@ century landholdings in northern England ; Percy also became Lord Poynings on his marriage . This title would bring him into direct conflict with the Poynings family themselves , and indeed , feuds with neighbouring nobles , both lay and ecclesiastical , would be a key occupancy of his youth . 
 Percy married Eleanor Poynings , who outlived him ; together they had four children . He was a leading Lancastrian during the Wars of the Roses , from which he managed to personally benefit , although his father died early in the war . He was not , however , to live to enjoy these gains , being killed at the Battle of Towton in 1461 on the defeated Lancastrian side . 
 = = Early life and war with Scotland = = 
 Percy was the son of Henry Percy , 2nd Earl of Northumberland , and Lady Eleanor Neville , daughter of Ralph Neville , 1st Earl of Westmorland , and his second wife , Joan Beaufort . 
 Percy was knighted in 1426 together with Henry VI . He was appointed Warden of the Eastern March on the Scottish border on 1 April 1440 , originally for four years , and subsequent extensions in 1444 , and 1445 , for the next seven years . This came as well with the custody of Berwick Castle and responsibility for its defence He was to hold this post until March 1461 . In May 1448 , Percy , with his father and Sir Robert Ogle , invaded Scotland in a pre @-@ emptive defence of the border , and burnt Dunbar and Dumfries , for which , in revenge , the Scots attacked his father 's castles of Alnwick and Warkworth . King Henry made his way north , and whilst at Durham sent Percy – now Lord Poynings – to raid <unk> ; the sortie – " only to return with some 500 cattle " – of around 5 @,@ 000 men failed , and he was captured whilst caught in a marsh following his father 's defeat at the River Sark on 23 October . Sir Robert Ogle was now outlawed and the king used half of his estates to compensate Poynings for the ransom he had expended arranging his release from captivity . Tensions with Scotland remained , to the extent that Poynings , his father , and other nobles were requested to stay and guard the border rather than attend Parliament , for which they were excused . In summer 1451 , with an Anglo @-@ Scottish truce pending , Poynings was commissioned to treat with Scottish embassies . In July 1455 , he successfully prevented an assault on Berwick by the Scottish King , James II , and was congratulated by the English King as a result . 
 = = Feud with the Poynings = = 
 In the late 1440s , the Yorkshire tenants of his father , the Earl of Northumberland , were in almost constant conflict with their neighbours , those of the Archbishop of York , involving armed skirmishes which Percy 's brothers led . These events were deemed so severe that in 1448 they led to the only progress north for the King during his reign . The same year , because of a dispute over the inheritance his family received as a result of Henry Percy 's marriage , the Earl of Northumberland 's retainers had ejected the earl 's relative , Robert Poynings , from his Sussex manors . A year later , Henry Percy – now Lord Poynings by right of his wife – took direct part , with his father , in raiding the manor of Newington Bertram in Kent , which was also enfeoffed by Robert . This attack also apparently involved cattle rustling and theft , and Robert later claimed it to be so brutal that he was " deterred from seeking a remedy at law for three years " . 
 = = Feud with Nevilles = = 
 By the early 1450s , relations with a powerful neighbouring family , the Nevilles became increasingly tense , and Poyning 's brother Thomas , Lord Egremont , had finally ambushed a Neville force , returning from a wedding , near Sheriff <unk> with a force of between 1 @,@ 000 and 5 @,@ 000 men . Although this was a bloodless confrontation , a precedent for the use of force in this particular dispute had already been laid in the previous violence in the region . By October 1453 , Poynings was directly involved , with his father , brothers Egremont and Richard , and joined by Lord Clifford , in forcing a battle with John and Richard Neville at Topcliffe . The feud continued into the next year , when Poyning reportedly planned on attending parliament accompanied by a large force of men in February , and three months later both he and the earl were summoned by the king to attend council in attempt to impose a peace ; a second letter was " written but not despatched " . Neither , along with John Neville or Salisbury , did as requested . 
 = = Wars of the Roses = = 
 During the Wars of the Roses , Percy followed his father in siding with the Lancastrians against the Yorkists . The Earl himself died at what is generally considered to be the first battle of the wars , at St Alban 's on 22 May 1455 , and Poynings was elevated as third Earl of Northumberland , without having to pay relief to the Crown , due the fact that his father had died in the King 's service . He in his turn " swore to uphold the Lancastrian dynasty " . Although a reconciliation of the leading magnates of the realm was attempted in October 1458 in London , he arrived with such a large body of men ( thought to be around 1 @,@ 500 ) that the city denied him entry . The new earl and his brother Egremont were bound over £ 4 @,@ 000 each to keep the peace . When conflict broke out again , he attended the so @-@ called Parliament of Devils in October 1459 , which condemned as traitors those Yorkists accused of , among other offences , causing the death of his father four years before . On 30 December 1460 , Percy led the central " battle " or section of the victorious Lancastrian army at the Battle of Wakefield , following which , the army marched south , pillaging on the road to London . He fought against Warwick at the second Battle of St. Alban 's on 17 February 1461 , and he commanded the Lancastrian van at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461 , however , " his archers were blinded by snowstorms " , and he was either slain in close fighting , or died of his wounds soon after . He was buried at St Denys 's Church , York . He was posthumously attainted by the first parliament of the victorious Edward IV in November 1461 , and his son and namesake was committed to the Tower . 
 = = Estates , offices and finances = = 
 The estates of the Earls of Northumberland had traditionally been in constant use as a source of manpower and wages in defence of the border since the Percy family first gained the office the previous century . The wages assigned to the third Earl were substantial : £ 2 @,@ 500 yearly in time of peace , and £ 5 @,@ 000 during war , as well as an annual payment for the maintenance of Berwick 's upkeep ( £ 66 in peacetime and £ 120 in wartime ) . Percy often had to provide from his own resources , however , as " securing payment was not easy " from the Exchequer , ( for example , in 1454 he received no payments at all ) . In July 1452 he gained a twenty @-@ year fee @-@ farm ( £ 80 yearly , from Carlisle ) , although he subsequently lost it in favour of Richard Neville , Earl of Salisbury , in July 1454 . Throughout the 1450s , the Crown continually made efforts at paying Percy his Warden 's wages and fees promptly ( paying him full wartime rates for the whole of the year 1456 @-@ 7 , for example ) , and since he was a loyal Lancastrian he achieved this more often than his counterpart on the west march , Salisbury , who by now had publicly aligned himself with York . The fee farm of Carlisle was returned to Percy in November 1459 , following Salisbury 's attainder in Coventry . He also benefited from the attainder of York , being granted an annuity of £ 66 from the latter 's forfeited Wakefield Lordship in Yorkshire ; he also received £ 200 from the profits of Penrith . 
 As a reward for his role in the Lancastrian victory at Ludford Bridge , he was made Chief Forester north of the River Trent and the Constable of Scarborough Castle on 22 December 1459 for life . He was nominated to a wide @-@ ranging commission of oyer and terminer ( from the old French , literally a commission " to hear and determine " ) on 30 May 1460 , his new rank was a tactic to deal with the treasons and insurrections in Northumberland . On 3 July , he was granted Yorkshire , Derbyshire , and Cambridgeshire , all belonging to Salisbury , on a twelve @-@ year lease . After the Yorkists captured Henry VI at the Battle of Northampton in 1460 , they accused Percy of having looted York 's northern estates during his exile in Ireland . This charge was likely to have had some truth in it , as it was his continued pillaging of those estates , with the Lords Clifford and Dacre , that led to York marching north to Wakefield in December 1460 . These incomes , however collected , would have been vital to the Earl both personally and militarily as his northern estates especially had been a victim of feudal decline for most of the first half of the fifteenth century : even on the forfeit of the earldom to the Crown in 1461 , his arrears have been calculated as still standing at approximately £ 12 @,@ 000 .

 = The Fabulous Kangaroos = 
 This team is not to be mistaken for the similarly named team The Royal Kangaroos of Jonathan Boyd and Norman Frederick Charles III 
 The Fabulous Kangaroos was a professional wrestling tag team that existed in various forms from 1957 until 1983 . The first incarnation of The Fabulous Kangaroos was formed when Italian Australian Al Costello teamed with Australia native Roy Heffernan and adopted an " Ultra Australian " gimmick complete with boomerangs , bush hats and the song " Waltzing Matilda " as their entrance music . Costello and Heffernan are arguably the most famous version of The Kangaroos , regarded as one of the top tag teams to ever compete in professional wrestling , and are often credited with popularizing tag team wrestling in the late 1950s and 1960s . 
 Later versions of The Kangaroos saw Al Costello team with Ray St. Clair in 1967 , and then with Don Kent from 1968 until 1974 . Don Kent went on to team with Bruno Bekkar , and later Johnny Heffernan ( a storyline cousin of Roy Heffernan ) to keep The Fabulous Kangaroos name alive until 1983 . 
 The Fabulous Kangaroos made their last appearance in 1983 , but almost a decade later , the then 72 @-@ year @-@ old Al Costello managed a team known as " The New Fabulous Kangaroos " in the American Independent circuit . The New Fabulous Kangaroos consisted of little known wrestlers Mickey Doyle , Denny Kass and Al Snow ; of the three , only Snow went on to national and international recognition . 
 Both Costello and Heffernan died before The Kangaroos were honored as the first tag team to ever be inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2003 , which started a tradition of inducting a new team every year .

 " The Fabulous Kangaroos " were the brainchild of Al Costello , who had spent the first 18 years of his wrestling career as a fairly unsuccessful singles competitor . In 1956 , Costello mentioned his idea of an " Ultra Australian " tag team to fellow wrestler , and future promoter , Joe Blanchard . Blanchard happened to be a good friend of Roy Heffernan , who had previously trained with Costello and became his choice for a partner . Costello and Heffernan made their debut as The Fabulous Kangaroos on 3 May 1957 , for Stu Hart ’ s Stampede Wrestling promotion of Canada , in a match against Maurice <unk> and Tony Baillargeon . Only weeks after making their debut , The Kangaroos were working with the top tag teams of the promotion . 
 After working in Stampede for a while The Fabulous Kangaroos started to travel across the United States , headlining shows wherever they went due to their ability to rile up crowds with their heel ( bad guy ) tactics . On one occasion in August 1958 , The Kangaroos , or " Kangaroo Men " as they were billed , nearly caused a riot in Madison Square Garden during a match against Antonino Rocca and Miguel Pérez ; the fans began to throw fruit and stones at them . After the match ended without a decisive winner , the promoters stepped in , turned up the arena lights , and played the National Anthem to stop a potential riot . This was a common tactic used at the time by the New York promoters to prevent riots and help the heels leave the arena unharmed . Later that year , Costello and Heffernan started working for Dory Funk ’ s NWA Western States promotion based in Amarillo , Texas . Here , The Kangaroos won their first title as a team when they defeated Pepper Gomez and El Medico to win the Texas version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship on 17 November 1958 . Their first title reign was short lived , however , as Pepper Gomez and Rito Romero defeated them to regain the titles two weeks later . 
 The following year , The Fabulous Kangaroos won the main tag team titles in NWA New Mexico , as well as the Texas version of the NWA International Tag Team Championship . In 1960 the Kangaroos moved on to New York , where they worked for Capitol Wrestling ( predecessor to the modern @-@ day WWE ) . On 21 July 1960 The Fabulous Kangaroos defeated Red and Lou Bastien to claim the North East version of the NWA United States Tag Team Championship ( which was later known as the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship ) . The Bastien brothers sought revenge and regained the gold during a rematch on 8 August 1960 . This time , the <unk> ' title reign only lasted 16 days when The Fabulous Kangaroos beat them again in Washington , D.C to become two @-@ time United States champions . Their second tenure as champions lasted almost three months , before they were defeated by Johnny Valentine and Buddy Rogers on 19 November 1960 . Costello and Heffernan won the titles for a third time only a week later and carried the gold into 1961 . On 11 January 1961 , The Kangaroos third title reign ended when they lost to the team of Johnny Valentine and Bob Ellis . 
 As was common in their day , The Kangaroos began to move around between territories to avoid overexposure . The team arrived in Championship Wrestling from Florida billed as NWA Florida United States Tag Team Champions . It was a tag team title they never technically won , but were instead awarded by the promoter . The Kangaroos stayed in Florida , defending against all challengers until the duo of Eddie Graham and Dick <unk> took the United States titles from them in a match on 1 November 1961 . In 1962 , The Kangaroos once again traveled across the United States , working for the Midwest Wrestling Association of Ohio where they held the Ohio version of the NWA United States tag team title . They also toured Japan with the Japan Wrestling Association and were the first to hold the Japanese version of the NWA International Tag Team Championship . In 1964 , Costello and Heffernan made their west coast debut , working in Los Angeles , California for the World Wrestling Association ( WWA ) where they beat Édouard Carpentier and Ernie Ladd for the WWA World Tag Team Championship . The Kangaroos held the titles for three months before losing them to the Torres brothers ( Alberto and Ramon ) on 28 April 1964 . 
 The Kangaroos never forgot their roots , and continued to work in Canada off and on through the years ; in addition to Stampede Wrestling , the team also worked for NWA All @-@ Star Wrestling based in Vancouver , British Columbia . While working for All @-@ Star Wrestling , The Kangaroos were involved in a heated storyline with Don Leo Jonathan and Roy McClarty that sold out arenas all across the territory . On 25 May 1964 The Kangaroos won the Vancouver version of the NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship , and immediately had to fend off the challenges of Jonathan and McClarty . During one infamous match in Winnipeg , The Kangaroos made Stan Stasiak an " honorary Kangaroo " for the night ( complete with bush hat and all ) for a six @-@ man tag team match against Jonathan , McClarty and Karl Gotch . During the match The Kangaroos ' cheating tactics aggravated the crowd so much that the fans threw chairs at the team . The Kangaroos attempted to hide under the ring to escape the flying chairs , but rabid fans tried to light the ring apron on fire to " smoke out " The Kangaroos . Peace was restored before anyone got seriously hurt and Jonathan and McClarty defeated The Kangaroos for the Canadian Tag Team titles , only to lose them back to the team from " Down Under " less than a month later . The Fabulous Kangaroos held the Canadian Tag team titles a total of four times while working for All @-@ Star wrestling , losing them for the final time on 17 May 1965 to the team of Do Leo Jonathan and Jim Hardy . For the better part of a year The Kangaroos had been double champions , holding both the Canadian Tag Team titles and the All @-@ Star version of the NWA International Tag Team titles . 
 Their time in NWA All @-@ Star Wrestling was the last time the original Kangaroos teamed together . In June 1965 , The Kangaroos lost to Don Leo Jonathan and Jim Hardy , and then split up . Heffernan had left Australia to tour the world in 1953 and wanted to return to his homeland , while Costello was determined to remain in the United States for a while longer .

 In 1967 , after having wrestled with other partners , including a stint as The Internationals with Karl Von Brauner , Costello decided that he wanted to reform The Fabulous Kangaroos . He got in touch with a friend from Great Britain , Tinker Todd , and asked him to be his new partner and reform The Fabulous Kangaroos . Todd agreed , taking the name " Ray St. Clair " and adopting an " Australian " persona . George " Crybaby " Cannon had managed Costello and Von Brauner when they wrestled as The Internationals , and he was brought in to be The Kangaroos new manager . Not long after Costello and St. Clair hit the circuit , they captured both gold and the hatred of the crowd , just like the original Kangaroos . A couple of months after reforming , Costello and St. Clair won the NWA Detroit version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship from Fred Curry and Billy Red Lyons , but lost the titles to Fred Curry and Dan Miller a few weeks later . Costello and St. Clair showed the same gift for riling up the fans as Costello and Heffernan had and even caused their own share of riots . One particular event in Cincinnati , Ohio saw the predominantly African American crowd start a riot after The Kangaroos spat in the eye of the African American Bobo Brazil during a match . The crowd rushed towards the ring when a fan fell from the balcony , causing a diversion that enabled Costello and St. Clair to escape the ring and get back to their dressing room . When fans started to break down the door to the dressing room , The Kangaroos ducked out the back , ran down an alley and hid in a half full dumpster overnight . The next morning when The Kangaroos returned to their car , they found all four tires slashed . Despite the success of the new version of The Fabulous Kangaroos , the Costello / St. Ray team did not last more than six tumultuous months . St. Clair missed his native Britain and was suffering from a debilitating knee injury that meant he had to retire from wrestling altogether . 
 = = = Al Costello and Don Kent = = = 
 Costello was not ready to give up on The Fabulous Kangaroos concept after St. Clair retired , and a few months later he found a new man to don the bush hat : Don Kent . Kent , who was from Michigan , adopted the Ultra @-@ Australian gimmick ( but retained his American accent ) and the two formed the third overall and second most well @-@ known version of the Fabulous Kangaroos . Costello and Kent continued in a tradition that was reminiscent of the original Kangaroos ; when a federation needed a new tag team title , the Kangaroos were brought in and acknowledged as champions on arrival instead of holding a tournament to determine the champions . In 1967 , the Japanese federation " International Wrestling Enterprise " ( IWE ) brought the Kangaroos in as the first Trans @-@ World Wrestling Alliance World Tag Team Champions . They held this title until 10 January 1968 when IWE mainstays <unk> and Thunder Sugiyama beat them for the gold . 
 Their time in Japan was only the first of many international tours for these third generation Kangaroos ; they worked all over Asia as well as in Costello 's homeland of Australia . In 1969 , the Kangaroos wrestled for the newly created Eastern Sports Association ( ESA ) out of Halifax , Nova Scotia , where they were once again recognized as champions on their arrival , becoming the inaugural holders of the ESA International Tag Team Championship . On 5 August 1969 , the Kangaroos dropped the titles to Eastern Sports Association mainstays The Beast and Rudy Kay . In 1970 , they joined Dick the Bruiser ’ s World Wrestling Association ( WWA ) , where they competed regularly for nearly two years . On 26 December 1970 Costello and Kent defeated WWA World Tag Team Champions Dick the Bruiser and Bill Miller to claim the tag titles . The Kangaroos used every dirty tactic to hold on to the gold for six months before losing the titles to Wilbur Snyder and Moose <unk> . On 18 June 1971 , the Kangaroos regained the titles , and held them for just over two months before Wilbur Snyder and Paul Christy beat them for their straps . After leaving the WWA , Costello and Kent made a few appearances in New York for the World Wide Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) , a promotion the original Kangaroos had previously worked for under the company 's former name , Capitol Wrestling . In one of their headline appearances at Madison Square Garden , the Kangaroos wrestled to a 45 @-@ minute time limit draw against Terry and Dory Funk , Sr .. 
 The Kangaroos were not only stars in the wrestling world , they also made a series of popular " celebrity baseball " appearances in 1971 – 1972 . At one celebrity all @-@ star game in Three Rivers Stadium , Pittsburgh , PA , the Kangaroos became the stars of the celebrity team by going 7 for 8 collectively and entertaining the fans with their horseplay and comedy antics . 
 On 18 December 1971 , The Fabulous Kangaroos defeated Ben Justice and the Stomper in the tournament finals for the new Detroit version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship . The Kangaroos worked for NWA Detroit for most of 1971 , defending the gold until Justice and the Stomper won the titles in July 1972 . By the end of 1972 , the Kangaroos began working for Nick Gulas ’ NWA Mid @-@ America promotion , based in the Southern United States , a promotion that Don Kent had worked for before becoming a Kangaroo . On 1 February 1973 , the Kangaroos defeated " The Heavenly Bodies " ( Don and Al Green ; not to be confused with the 1990s team of the same name ) to add yet another version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship , the Mid @-@ America version , to their long list of title accomplishments . The Kangaroos held that title three times between February and 22 September 1973 , when they lost to the team of Lorenzo Parente and Randy Curtis . During 1973 George Cannon was replaced as the Kangaroos manager by " Sir " Dudley Clements . 
 After a match in the Cincinnati Gardens , an enraged fan took a fire extinguisher off the wall and threw it at Costello and Kent from the balcony of the Gardens . The extinguisher hit Costello in the hip , damaging it so much that he needed hip replacement surgery later that year . The fan was arrested , served 15 days in jail , and fined $ 50 for damaging the fire extinguisher . The hip injury meant that Costello was unable to compete and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again . Don Kent returned to NWA Mid @-@ America to work as a singles wrestler , while Costello had a full hip replacement , and was forced to retire from active competition . In 1975 , Costello surprised everyone by returning to professional wrestling as the manager of a team known as " The Love Brothers " ( Hartford and Reggie Love ) . He actually stepped into the ring on occasion as part of special six @-@ man tag team matches . 
 After recovering from his hip surgery , Costello returned to active competition at the age of 56 , teaming up with Tony Charles to form yet another version of The Fabulous Kangaroos . The team defeated Dominic DeNucci and Chris Markoff to win the Detroit version of the NWA World Tag Team title , the same title that Costello and Kent had previously held . The Kangaroos title run was short , however , and they lost their gold to " Crazy " Luke Graham and Ripper Collins . In 1977 Tony Charles was replaced by Don Kent and the two reunited for a tour of Puerto Rico with the World Wrestling Council ( WWC ) . In Puerto Rico , the Kangaroos arrived billed as the WWC World Tag Team Champions , once more to give a newly created title legitimacy . They dropped the titles to Carlos Colón and Jose Rivera on 12 March 1977 . The Kangaroos remained in the WWC till 1978 , chasing , but never regaining the WWC World Tag Team Championship . After their tour in Puerto Rico ended , Don Kent returned to singles wrestling , and Costello refocused on managing . 
 = = = Don Kent and Bruno Bekkar = = = 
 In 1981 , Don Kent donned the bush hat and picked up the boomerang once more after not having worked as a Kangaroo since 1974 , except for the short run in 1977 . Costello asked Kent to team up with Bruno Bekkar , who was mostly known from working in his native New Zealand and Australia . Kent and Bekkar worked a tour for the WWC while Costello served as their manager . The team won the WWC North American Tag Team titles from Jack and Jerry Brisco on 22 October 1981 . They then lost the titles to Invader I and Super Gladiator but quickly gained them back before dropping the titles for good to Invader and Gladiator on 26 January 1982 . The Kent and Bekkar team only lasted through one tour of the Caribbean , after which Bruno Bekkar returned to Australia and New Zealand to work for the local promotions there . 
 = = = Don Kent and Johnny Heffernan = = = 
 After Bekkar went back to Australia , Kent found a new partner to create yet another version of the Fabulous Kangaroos that turned out to be the last incarnation of the team . In mid 1982 , Kent teamed up with Lutte Internationale mainstay Bob Della Serra , who took the wrestling name " Johnny Heffernan " ( or " Bobby Heffernan " at times ) - a storyline cousin of Roy Heffernan . The team ended Terry and Dory Funk , Jr . ' s year and a half run with the WWC World Tag Team championship on 1 May 1982 . Kent and Heffernan held the gold for less than two months before losing the WWC World Tag Team titles to Invader I and Pierre Martel . After a tour in Puerto Rico , Costello Kent and Heffernan returned to work for Championship Wrestling from Florida ( CWF ) , a promotion the Kangaroos last worked for in 1962 . On 5 January 1983 , the Kangaroos defeated Barry Windham and Ron Bass to win the NWA Florida Global Tag Team Championship . They held the titles four times between January and 13 April 1983 , losing to and winning titles from such teams as Terry Allen and Scott McGhee , Terry Allen and The Midnight Rider , and Terry Allen and Brad Armstrong . The final storyline involving The Fabulous Kangaroos saw Al Costello bring in J.J. Dillon to act as his short term replacement while he was " away on business " . When Costello returned from his business trip , Dillon ( kayfabe ) refused to give up the Kangaroos contracts and was backed up by both Kent and Heffernan . The angle was designed to write Al Costello out of The Fabulous Kangaroos ' storyline , and allow him to retire from wrestling altogether . Not long after Costello retired , Kent and Della Serra went their separate ways . Don Kent retired in 1986 , but made guest appearances in the ring from time to time as late as 1992 . 
 = = = New Fabulous Kangaroos = = = 
 After retiring from wrestling , Al Costello became the head of security at College Harbor , Florida . In 1992 , at the age of 71 , Costello retired from his job in Florida and began teaching wrestling . He also started to manage " The New Fabulous Kangaroos " in 1993 consisting of Mickey Doley and Denny Kass who worked for " Motor City Wrestling " ( MCW ) . By the fall of 1993 Mickey Doyle had been replaced by a young wrestler by the name of Al Snow , and with Costello 's help The New Fabulous Kangaroos defeated " Canadian Lighting " ( Otis Apollo and " Irish " Bobby Clancy ) on 29 December 1993 to win the MCW Tag Team Championship . On 14 May 1994 , after Al Snow had started working for the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) , Kass and Snow defeated Canadian Lighting to win the Border City Wrestling ( BCW ) Can @-@ Am Tag Team Championship , unifying the two tag team championships . A week later , The New Fabulous Kangaroos lost both sets of titles to Scott D 'Amore and " Irish " Bobby Clancy . After losing the unified MCW / BCW Tag Team championships , The New Kangaroos split up . Snow focused on his WWF career , while Costello retired for good .

 The Fabulous Kangaroos are considered by many in the wrestling world as one of the best tag @-@ teams in the history of wrestling . In fact , many people in the past held the mistaken belief that The Fabulous Kangaroos invented tag team wrestling , which was not true since tag team wrestling had been seen as early as 1936 . The reason for this belief lies in the fact that The Kangaroos were one of the first teams to popularize tag team wrestling , and because tag teaming was often referred to as " Australian rules " or " Australian tag team " . The Kangaroos themselves were not slow to play off this belief , often claiming ( kayfabe ) that they were such a well coordinated tag team because " Amateur team wrestling was very popular in Australia " . The term " Australian rules " had been coined long before 1957 debut of The Kangaroos . Records indicate that tag team wrestling was already being referred to as " Australian rules " already in the mid @-@ 1940s . The Fabulous Kangaroos were among the first people in wrestling to play up the sports entertainment elements in professional wrestling ; beyond being talented wrestlers , Costello especially was also very good at playing up their characters . The Kangaroos showed their " advertising " skills through promotional literature , which stated that The Fabulous Kangaroos had " fashioned a razor @-@ edged aluminum boomerang to cut the jugular of a Kodiak bear from afar " . They also frequently threw cardboard boomerangs with their name and pictures on them into the crowd as they walked to the ring . The team carried a huge Australian banner with the name " The Fabulous Kangaroos " on it as part of their entrance rituals as well .

 Roy Heffernan died on 24 September 1992 in his home in Sydney , Australia from a heart attack . Don Kent died on 14 June 1993 after a long battle with Leukemia . On 22 January 2000 , the last of the original Fabulous Kangaroos died . Costello had been suffering from pneumonia , and was diagnosed with heart problems , the combination of which took his life at age 80 . 
 Only Bruno Bekkar and Johnny Heffernan remain alive , with managers Red Berry , George Cannon and Dudley Clement having passed on as well . Ray St. Clair , whose birth name was Ramon Napolitano , died on 14 July 2013 . 
 In 2003 , the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame inducted Al Costello and Roy Heffernan collectively as The Fabulous Kangaroos , the first tag team to be inducted into the Hall of Fame . Since that time , the Hall of Fame has honored other tag teams , but The Fabulous Kangaroos were given the honor of being the first . In the tradition of The Kangaroos , they were " billed as champions on arrival " one last time . In 2013 , Costello and Heffernan was inducted into the NWA Hall of Fame .
