 On December 10 , 1951 , Easton Mayor Joseph Morrison flipped the switch to light up the Christmas Candle during its first dedication ceremony . Joining Morrison and Frank Bechtel in the dedication were a Catholic priest , a Jewish rabbi and a Protestant minister , to demonstrate the Christmas Candle was meant to serve as a symbol of peace for all religions and denominations . News reports indicate between 500 and 1 @,@ 000 people attended the ceremony . In addition to the candle , the decorations included Christmas trees , smaller candle displays , large plywood wreaths and Christmas lights set up by students from the Easton High School and the city 's Wolf and Schull junior high schools . It also included a plaque honoring the Easton area men and women on active duty in the United States armed forces . The Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission decorated the nearby Northampton Street bridge , which crossed the Delaware River , with its first Christmas light display in 14 years . A series of nightly Christmas choir concerts were held in front of the Christmas Candle starting December 18 , and organ music was piped to the Centre Square from the city 's First Presbyterian Church . Downtown business owners participated by decorating their windows with Christmas themes . Morrison called the Christmas Candle display " the most elaborate in Easton 's history " . The Christmas Candle was so large it drew the attention of airplanes passing over the city . 
 On December 11 , however , one of the neon lights in the flame structure short @-@ circuited and started a fire on the yellow cotton sack placed over the bugler statue , causing an actual fire on the Christmas Candle flame for a brief amount of time . The blaze caused only minor damage to the Christmas Candle , but the bugler statue was exposed and visible inside the flame for the rest of the season . Despite this setback , the Christmas Candle was widely considered a success , and the Easton Area Christmas Committee signed a charter on December 17 , 1951 , tasking itself with organizing a yearly holiday program revolving around the Christmas Candle . The candle was assembled again every Christmas season until 1961 , with ceremonies generally including holiday decorations , Christmas carols , refreshments , appearances by Santa Claus and other forms of entertainment . The Easton Area Christmas Committee was responsible for raising the funds and encouraging the civic interest necessary to keep the program active . 
 In 1952 , a new , fireproof flame as designed in response to the previous year 's fire . The new flame design enclosed the steel tubing of the flame ( which concealed the bugler statue ) , looked more realistic and better matched the flames on the four smaller candles at the Christmas Candle 's base . The 1952 Christmas Candle display included further expansions from the previous year , including the addition of 20 new plywood light standard plaques by the Easton High School , as well as decorations on the Bushkill Street Bridge in addition to the Northampton Street bridge . With the hopes of increasing nationwide publicity for the Christmas Candle , the Easton City Council started dubbing the structure , " the world 's largest Christmas candle " . The Easton Area Christmas Committee continued raising the funds for the Christmas program up until 1957 , when they needed to raise $ 3 @,@ 500 from the public to make necessary repairs to the Christmas Candle for safety reasons . The next year , the committee started to receive a budget from the city , and were approved for $ 3 @,@ 000 by the city council in 1958 . The program continued to grow each year , and included 3 @,@ 000 Evergreen trees assembled around the Centre Square by 1957 , when more than 500 people attended the lighting ceremony in 20 @-@ degree weather . 
 = = = Removal and reconstruction = = = 
 In 1961 , the Christmas Candle fell into a state of disrepair , and the contractors who assemble the candle for discounted prices in previous years informed the city they could not handle the project again . The Easton Area Christmas Committee also had trouble raising additional money needed for the repairs , For all these reasons , they decided not to assemble the candle again . The candle was placed into storage at an old incinerator plant on Pennsylvania Route 611 , and the Easton Area Christmas Committee sought alternative decorations for its holiday program . In 1961 , 24 streams of multi @-@ colored Christmas light strands ( totaling 2 @,@ 650 bulbs ) were draped from the top of the monument to the edges of Centre Square , creating an umbrella @-@ like shape of lights . More than 200 Christmas Trees were also placed around the base of the monument , along with a nativity scene and Christmas light decorations on the nearby bridges . The set @-@ up cost only $ 2 @,@ 000 , compared to the average $ 3 @,@ 000 for the Christmas Candle display . This display was used for the next five years , and the decorations around the Soldiers ' & Sailors ' Monument came to be known as " the umbrella of Christmas lights " . 
 In early 1965 , Easton City Councilman Fred Ashton conducted a report announcing there had been " considerable criticism " of Easton 's holiday decorations , prompting the Easton Area Christmas Committee to consider restoring the candle . But public contributions had continued to decline , and the project was so expensive the city deemed they could not afford it . The next year , however , Councilman Henry Schultz started an effort to restore the Christmas Candle . Schultz recruited a number of volunteers to make the necessary repairs , including Easton artist Joseph <unk> , who repainted the structure . Councilman William <unk> also urged that repairs be made , claiming the candle was " known all around the world " and should remain part of Easton 's holiday celebration . A new , 14 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) flame was built using a new type of quartz , which used 6 @,@ 000 watts to create a stronger light . The candle was erected and lighted at a ceremony on November 25 , 1966 , for the first time in six years . Easton Mayor George S. Smith flipped the switch , and the candle was once again dedicated to the local men and women of the armed forces . More than 400 people attended the ceremony , which this year also included 68 Christmas trees decorated with 1 @,@ 500 lights . 
 In the fall of 1967 , it was decided the Christmas Candle would be renamed the Peace Candle , because the city planned to sell Christmas cards depicting the structure and hoped Easton would become known as " the Peace Candle city " . On October 18 , the city 's businesses issued a statement , " Whether you choose to call it a Christmas Candle or a Peace Candle is not important . The important aspect is that the Candle is our clarion call , and this call will be issued this year as a reaffirmation of our desire for peace and harmony in all facts of our lives and throughout the world . " On November 27 , 1967 , about 1 @,@ 500 people attended the Peace Candle lighting , which would prove to be the final ceremony of its kind for that incarnation of the candle , which would be rebuilt in subsequent years . The bells of six different downtown churches were rung during the ceremony , and people surrounded the Peace Candle holding lit wax candles themselves . Also in 1967 , a photo and caption of the Peace Candle was featured in the December 6 issue Weekly Reader , a national children 's newspaper circulated in the nation 's schools . A columnist for the magazine named " Aunt Em " said it was featured because , " I think the candle in Easton is especially lovely since it is a symbol for both Hanukkah and Christmas " . Appeared on December 6 , 1967 .

 On October 25 , 1968 , a fire at the former incinerator plant off Route 611 , where the Peace Candle was being stored , destroyed the four smaller candles that surround the base of the larger candle . The fire was believed to have started by someone playing with matches inside the building . Firefighters battled the blaze for more than an hour . Damage was estimated at a cost of $ 1 @,@ 200 . Initially , city officials announced the fire would not delay the lighting ceremony planned for December 1 . However , the Easton Area Christmas Committee had already been debating the construction of a new Peace Candle prior to the fire . On October 29 , Henry Schultz , now chairman of the Christmas committee , announced the four smaller candles were damaged beyond repair and no effort would be made to rebuild them . Instead , the committee would build an entirely new candle within a year . 
 The original plywood candle was replaced with a stronger candle made of fiberglass and galvanized steel , the covering of which was stretched on steel and wood frames . It was designed by the Allentown @-@ based firm <unk> 's Inc. and constructed at a cost of about $ 12 @,@ 500 . The flame was built out of fiberglass strips with lights that changed color in sequence , to create a more realistic burning flame than the original candle . The new structure was 90 @-@ foot ( 27 m ) , compared to the original 80 @-@ foot ( 24 m ) . Each side of the new candle was about 8 @.@ 5 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 6 m ) wide on each side . Due to the increase in size , it was no longer necessary to place the flame structure over the bugler statue on the top of the Soldiers ' & Sailors ' Monument . Four new smaller candles were built and stood 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) tall and were about 3 @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) wide on each side . Special lighting equipment was added to give the Peace Candle a natural effect that would make it realistically flicker throughout the night . At the base of the candles , 75 10 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) tall evergreen trees with gold ornaments were placed , strung with more than 2 @,@ 000 Christmas tree lights . 
 The first lighting ceremony for the new candle was held on November 28 , 1969 , and attended by about 450 people . Mayor Fred Ashton Jr. threw the switch , and Rev. Harry <unk> of the Olivet Presbyterian Church urged that the symbol serve as a symbol of peace in America , nothing the growing casualties in the Vietnam War at the time . Schultz said the new candle was symbolic of the growing development in the Easton area . The new candle was stored in the city 's garage on Bushkill Drive while not assembled . 
 = = = Second candle = = = 
 The new candle sustained some minor damage over its first few years . On November 20 , 1970 , heavy rain and inclement weather snapped a wire helping keep the structure in place , and firefighters had to install additional braces the next day . Also that year , about 75 lights were stolen from the decorative Christmas trees set up around the candle 's base . In 1971 , the building where the Peace Candle was stored was broken into and the fiberglass paneling was vandalized . Easton officials declined to discuss the extent of the damage , but Henry Schultz dismissed the vandals as " kids " . In 1974 , the Peace Candle was only lit a few hours a night , and not at all on some nights , due to an ongoing energy crisis , which prompted the Metropolitan Edison Company to ask its Easton area customers not to use Christmas lights that year . Since the Peace Candle was seldom lit , charitable donations dropped in 1974 , resulting in an $ 800 defect for the Easton Area Christmas Committee . Additionally the committee spent $ 1 @,@ 700 in Peace Candle Christmas cards meant to bring in donations , but only 500 packs were sold at $ 1 each . The use of less electricity to light the Peace Candle did not help the committee because the city paid the lighting bill . 
 In November 1975 , new concrete had been poured at Center Square as part of a beautification project , and the Peace Candle could not be assembled without damaging the work . As a result , the Easton Area Christmas Committee hastily organized a Christmas tree lighting on the Easton Redevelopment Authority parking lot , which was attended by only about 200 people , far below the usual candle lighting ceremony attendance . James Darvin , vice president of the Christmas committee , called it a " last @-@ minute affair " . In order to ensure the candle was erected in 1976 , Nazareth contractor Stewart Beatty donated equipment and employees to help erect the structure , along with local carpenters , electricians and city workers . Downtown Easton businesses also donated $ 1 @,@ 600 to help offset the $ 3 @,@ 500 cost of refurbishing and putting up the candle . Although the Peace Candle was erected and lit in 1977 , the formal lighting ceremony had to be canceled due to heavy rain and cold temperatures . Larry Holmes , the heavyweight boxing champion and Easton native , threw the switch himself during the lighting ceremony on November 24 , 1978 . 
 Throughout the late @-@ 1970s and the 1980s , the Nazareth @-@ based firm Beatty Contractors erected the candle each year . The firm originally did the project for free , but began charging $ 2 @,@ 000 in 1981 when the cost of fuel started to rise . During the Peace Candle lighting ceremony on November 28 , 1980 , Easton Mayor Philip <unk> dedicated the candle to the 52 American hostages being held in Iran during the Iran hostage crisis . During a storm on December 6 , 1983 , 47 mile @-@ per @-@ hour winds caused the Peace Candle to start tilting in place . When city workers removed the flame next day , they realized the bugler statue atop the Soldiers ' & Sailors ' Monument had moved on its base and would have toppled over had it not been leaning against the candle structure . One of the candle 's anchor cables was also snapped by the wind and torn out of the brickwork . The cable was repaired and the bugler statue , which was previously held by its own weight , was reinforced with grouting . A sixteen @-@ pound chunk of granite was also dislodged from the top of the statue , although in an area that most spectators cannot see from ground level . The candle suffered similar damage in 1988 , when high winds loosened parts of the structure and snapped support wires . As a result , it had to be taken down early on January 5 , 1989 . In 1985 , the Easton Area Christmas Committee was renamed to the Easton Holiday Committee .

 By 1989 , the Peace Candle had become so dilapidated that it was hardly able to sustain the winter weather . Strong winds in November had shaken the structure so much that the wax dripping fixtures atop the candle had fallen off . On November 16 , 1989 , Mayor Sal Panto Jr. announced on WEST 's Voice of the People show that the Peace Candle would not go up another year because the support structure was too weak and the Easton Area Christmas Committee was not receiving enough donations to pay for repairs . The committee was now receiving an average of $ 3 @,@ 000 a year in donations , which was used to maintain the existing candle . Panto said , " The sad reality is , this is the last year . " However , new fundraising efforts were started to raise $ 20 @,@ 000 to build a new Peace Candle . Local businesses and unions volunteered their time and materials to work on it , with the Lehigh Valley Carpenters Union working up to 100 hours a week for about five weeks to have the candle ready for the 1990 holiday season . 
 The new candle was designed by the Allentown firm Alvin Butz Co . , the Allentown firm Barry Isett & Associates , and Bethlehem Steel Corp. Supplies were provided by Dugan & <unk> Inc . , <unk> Mills , Ingersoll @-@ Rand Co. and <unk> Painting , and the construction done by the Carpenters Union Local 600 , Electricians Union Local 367 and the Northampton County Labor Council . It looked almost exactly the same as the old previous candle , with eight flood lights installed to illuminate the white shaft . The candle cost $ 35 @,@ 000 to build , but Panto said without the help from volunteers , it would have cost around $ 150 @,@ 000 , not including labor . In order to cover the $ 15 @,@ 000 shortfall in funds raised , the city sold Christmas cards , posters , ornaments and $ 10 Peace Candle ownership shares . The first lighting ceremony for the new candle was held November 23 , 1990 . 
 = = = Third candle = = = 
 On January 12 , 1999 , the spotlights surrounding the Peace Candle were accidentally turned on , and the heat from the lights ignited a fire among several of the Christmas trees surrounding the structure . Several residents called police and sprayed the flames with fire extinguishers until city firefighters arrived to put out the blaze . Although flames reached as high as 30 feet , only the trees were damaged and the Peace Candle itself was undamaged . The incident spurred discussion about removing the trees altogether , but Easton officials insisted the fire was just a fluke accident . New spotlights were installed in 2000 , which lit the candle from top to bottom and focused on the Soldiers ' & Sailors ' Monument for the rest of the year . 
 By 2000 , the city 's Christmas decorations also included lighted snowflakes on the utility poles of Easton streets surrounding the Peace Candle . The 32 six @-@ foot snowflake decorations cost just over $ 10 @,@ 800 , which were funded in part by a $ 6 @,@ 000 Community Development Block Grant secured by the city . The Easton Holiday Committee said it was becoming increasing difficult to raise sufficient funds for the holiday display and sought $ 10 @,@ 000 from the city council , but they were rejected . In response , six of the eleven Easton Holiday Committee members resigned in March 2001 , prompting fear that the Peace Candle would not be erected during its 50th anniversary that following holiday season . However , the committee was filled with new volunteers who revamped efforts to raise funds through the sale of wax candles and greeting cards . The Peace Candle was lit during a ceremony on November 23 , 2001 , in dedication to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks , as well as rescue workers from New York City , The Pentagon and Somerset County , Pennsylvania who responded the day of the attacks . 
 In 2003 , a six @-@ foot slab of fiberglass from the imitation wax at the top of the candle was knocked loose by 50 mile @-@ per @-@ hour winds during a storm . Nobody was injured . James <unk> , a filmmaker from Pohatcong Township , New Jersey , made a documentary film in 2004 focused on that year 's assembly of the Peace Candle , as well as interviews with politicians , artists , merchants and construction workers about the history of the structure . It was first screened in December 2004 and made available subsequently on VHS and DVD . In October 2008 , fear grew that the Peace Candle would no longer be erected when Easton employees who previously volunteer to climb the Peace Candle structure no longer wished to assemble it . Those fears were put to rest the next month , however , when the trade union Lehigh Valley Erectors Inc. volunteered to put the candle up . 
 In 2007 , Easton Mayor Phil <unk> dedicated that year 's lighting to the troops fighting in Iraq and all of America 's veterans . At about 7 p.m. , the mayor introduced U.S. Navy veteran Kyle Stocker , whose son 4 ½ -year @-@ old <unk> hit the switch to turn on the spotlights illuminating the candle . 
 In 2009 , Superior Court Judge Jack <unk> won a $ 770 bid on the auction website eBay to flip the switch and turn on the Peace Candle during the candle @-@ lighting ceremony on November 27 , 2009 . In November 2010 , Easton Holiday Committee Chairwoman Sandy O 'Brien @-@ Werner voiced doubts that the current candle structure would last until 2014 as previously projected and might need to be replaced sooner . She expressed concern at the cost of such a venture , claiming the Peace Candle cost $ 14 @,@ 640 in 2010 alone for maintenance and operation and that an altogether new structure would cost at least $ 35 @,@ 000 . In response , six @-@ year @-@ old <unk> Soffera and eight @-@ year @-@ old Katie Dietrich , two cousins from Williams Township who loved the Peace Candle , opened a snow cone stand during a garage sale to raise money for the candle . They raised $ 23 , which they presented to Mayor Sal Panto Jr. during a November city council meeting . 
 = = Anti @-@ war protests and vigils = = 
 Due to its symbolism for peace and its placement over a Civil War monument , the Peace Candle has been the site of several anti @-@ war protests over the decades . On December 16 , 1972 , a group of Vietnam War protesters gathered at the Trinity Episcopal Church in Easton and drafted a petition asking Easton City Council to keep the Peace Candle up all year long until the war was ended . Although the protesters acknowledged it was unlikely their request would be granted , they felt the petition itself was a symbolic gesture . Easton City Council President Henry Schultz commended the idea , but said it was not within the authority of the council and that it would be " physically impossible " to keep the candle up all year . At the time , liability insurance was only available up to February 1 , and that keeping it up longer than necessary increased the possibility of an accident or damage from the weather . As part of the petition , the protesters asked city council to draft a resolution formally naming the structure the Peace Candle , claiming although it was commonly referred to by that name , a formal name had never been officially established . Schultz refuted that request , claiming the name had already been established five years earlier . 
 In 1975 , the activist citizens group Lehigh @-@ Pocono Committee of Concern ( <unk> ) formed a " human peace candle " in front of the real structure as a protest against the Vietnam War . Three group members formed a triangle while another man stood on top of their shoulders , holding a lighted candle and a sign that read , " Bring the troops home for Christmas and the rest of the year " . The protest marked the 10th anniversary of <unk> 's first protest against the war when they formed in 1965 , which was also held at Center Square . In December 1981 , the Polish labor union Solidarity held a late @-@ night peace rally that included a candlelight vigil , singing and prayers for a peaceful resolution to the martial law crisis in Poland . In 1991 , the city decided to leave the Peace Candle standing until the Gulf War conflict was resolved in honor of the 500 @,@ 000 American troops serving in the war . The gesture was approved after a pool of residents indicated a ratio of 10 @-@ to @-@ 1 supported it . During this time , supporters of the troops tied yellow ribbons around the candle and its surrounding fence , while protesters tied black ribbons to symbolize those who died in the conflict . The candle was taken down that March after the war ended . 
 On November 14 , 2015 , the candle was lit nearly two weeks prior to the official ceremony date after local resident Joe Mercado posted to an Easton , Pennsylvania Facebook community page asking to light the candle to show support for the people of Paris , France after a terrorist attack the day before . Due to overwhelming response to the post , the city organized a candle light vigil that evening with several hundred residents attending . Prayers were offered in several languages , including French , and several faiths . Easton Mayor Sal Panto Jr. and Allentown Mayor Ed <unk> spoke . The candle remained lit for three days before being shut off until the official lighting event . 
 = = Merchandise and memorabilia = = 
 In 1967 , the Easton Area Christmas Committee began selling greeting cards depicting Easton 's Peace Candle with the hopes of raising funds to maintain the city 's holiday decorations . The committee created 15 @,@ 000 cards that year , and the city 's Downtown Improvement Group urged residents to buy the cards and mail them to friends and family across the country , with the hopes that Easton would become nationally known as the " Peace Candle City " . The cards were sold in packs of three for $ 1 at city businesses and homes . They were designed in four colors from a painting by Easton artist Joseph <unk> depicting the Centre Square and the Peace Candle . The 15 @,@ 000 cards went on sale on Starting on October 18 , 1967 , Starting on October 18 , 1967 , and 12 @,@ 000 were already sold by October 30 . The rest by November 1 , and another and another 15 @,@ 000 due to what Councilman Henry Schultz called the " tremendous demand " . In 1969 , to advertise and celebrate the first lighting ceremony for the second candle , the Easton Area Christmas Committee sold placemats and napkin sets with an image of the Peace Candle in a night setting . Ten thousand sets were sold for $ 1 each at various stores and banks in the city . 
 Both in 1967 and 1968 , U.S. Rep. Fred B. Rooney lobbied the United States Post Office Department seeking for the Peace Candle to chosen for the official Christmas Stamp in the following year . However , it was rejected both years by the Citizens ' Stamp Advisory Committee , which reviewed the proposals and narrowed the applications . In 1968 , an image of the painting The Annunciation by Jan van Eyck was chosen rather than the Peace Candle . In October 1979 , the <unk> , Pennsylvania @-@ based <unk> 's Distillery created whiskey decanters patterned after the Peace Candle . The idea was first posed by Mark <unk> of Palmer Township , a decanter collector who approached Schultz with the concept in 1978 . Schultz brought the idea to the distillery , which chose to base their second annual Christmas decanter on the Peace Candle . They spent $ 3 @,@ 500 to build a 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) sculpture based on photos of the structure . The decanter , which holds 750 @-@ millilitre ( 26 imp fl oz ; 25 US fl oz ) is off @-@ white with red and yellow flames atop the candles and bunches of Christmas greens around the base . Six thousand decanters were produced and originally sold for a $ 49 @.@ 50 retail price . They were shipped to collectors as far as Texas , California and England . 
 In 1990 , the city released a china plate with the Peace Candle along with a Christmas tree , which was meant to symbolize the first tree in the nation , which was believed to have been erected in Easton in 1816 . During the 2000 holiday season , the Easton Holiday Committee produced and sold commemorative plates marking the 50th anniversary of the Peace Candle , which included a painting of the structure by local artist Preston <unk> . They were sold for $ 32 along with ceramic ornaments of the Easton eatery Colonial Pizza , which sold for $ 22 . Over the years , Christmas cards depicting the Peace Candle have continued to be used as a means of raising funds for the structure . 
 = = Criticism = = 
 Ever since the Peace Candle was first erected , some Easton residents have been critical of the structure , arguing it is a tacky symbol of the over @-@ commercialization of Christmas and not a tasteful way to convey a message of peace . Many have condemned the fact that the Peace Candle covers the Soldiers ' & Sailors ' Monument , which proponents see as a sign of disrespect toward veterans . Critics have also argued the candle is too expensive to maintain each year , and some have claimed the phallic shape of the symbol is inappropriate . In 1982 , a petition was signed by 90 people and submitted to the Easton City Council seeking to discontinue the Peace Candle tradition , calling it a " garish symbol of inner @-@ city decadence " . The group wanted to replace it with a decorative display of evergreen tree , in honor of Easton 's claim to be the first city in the United States to observe that German custom . The city rejected the petition after conducting a survey of public opinion , which polled 29 city residents in favor of the Peace Candle and four against it . 
 = Bald eagle = 
 The bald eagle ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus , from Greek <unk> " sea " , <unk> " eagle " , <unk> " white " , <unk> " head " ) is a bird of prey found in North America . A sea eagle , it has two known subspecies and forms a species pair with the white @-@ tailed eagle ( Haliaeetus albicilla ) . Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska , all of the contiguous United States , and northern Mexico . It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old @-@ growth trees for nesting . 
 The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish , which it swoops down and snatches from the water with its talons . It builds the largest nest of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species , up to 4 m ( 13 ft ) deep , 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) wide , and 1 metric ton ( 1 @.@ 1 short tons ) in weight . Sexual maturity is attained at the age of four to five years . 
 Bald eagles are not actually bald ; the name derives from an older meaning of the word , " white headed " . The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail . The sexes are identical in plumage , but females are about 25 percent larger than males . The beak is large and hooked . The plumage of the immature is brown . 
 The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States of America . The bald eagle appears on its seal . In the late 20th century it was on the brink of extirpation in the contiguous United States . Populations have since recovered and the species was removed from the U.S. government 's list of endangered species on July 12 , 1995 and transferred to the list of threatened species . It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the Lower 48 States on June 28 , 2007 . 
 = = Description = = 
 The plumage of an adult bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail . The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge @-@ shaped . Males and females are identical in plumage coloration , but sexual dimorphism is evident in the species , in that females are 25 % larger than males . The beak , feet and irises are bright yellow . The legs are feather @-@ free , and the toes are short and powerful with large talons . The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes . The beak is large and hooked , with a yellow cere . The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range . The closely related African fish eagle ( H. <unk> ) ( from far outside the bald eagle 's range ) also has a brown body , white head and tail , but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill . 
 The plumage of the immature is a dark brown overlaid with messy white streaking until the fifth ( rarely fourth , very rarely third ) year , when it reaches sexual maturity . Immature bald eagles are distinguishable from the golden eagle ( Aquila chrysaetos ) , the only other very large , non @-@ <unk> bird in North America , in that the former has a larger , more protruding head with a larger beak , straighter edged wings which are held flat ( not slightly raised ) and with a stiffer wing beat and feathers which do not completely cover the legs . When seen well , the golden eagle is distinctive in plumage with a more solid warm brown color than an immature bald eagle , with a reddish @-@ golden patch to its nape and ( in immature birds ) a highly contrasting set of white squares on the wing . Another distinguishing feature of the immature bald eagle over the mature bird is its black , yellow @-@ tipped beak ; the mature eagle has a fully yellow beak . 
 The bald eagle has sometimes been considered the largest true raptor ( accipitrid ) in North America . The only larger species of raptor @-@ like bird is the California condor ( Gymnogyps californianus ) , a New World vulture which today is not generally considered a taxonomic ally of true accipitrids . However , the golden eagle , averaging 4 @.@ 18 kg ( 9 @.@ 2 lb ) and 63 cm ( 25 in ) in wing chord length in its American race ( A. c. canadensis ) , is merely 455 g ( 1 @.@ 003 lb ) lighter in mean body mass and exceeds the bald eagle in mean wing chord length by around 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) . Additionally , the bald eagle 's close cousins , the relatively longer @-@ winged but shorter @-@ tailed white @-@ tailed eagle and the overall larger Steller 's sea eagle ( H. pelagicus ) , may , rarely , wander to coastal Alaska from Asia . 
 The bald eagle has a body length of 70 – 102 cm ( 28 – 40 in ) . Typical wingspan is between 1 @.@ 8 and 2 @.@ 3 m ( 5 @.@ 9 and 7 @.@ 5 ft ) and mass is normally between 3 and 6 @.@ 3 kg ( 6 @.@ 6 and 13 @.@ 9 lb ) . Females are about 25 % larger than males , averaging 5 @.@ 6 kg ( 12 lb ) , and against the males ' average weight of 4 @.@ 1 kg ( 9 @.@ 0 lb ) . The size of the bird varies by location and generally corresponds with Bergmann 's rule , since the species increases in size further away from the Equator and the tropics . For example , eagles from South Carolina average 3 @.@ 27 kg ( 7 @.@ 2 lb ) in mass and 1 @.@ 88 m ( 6 @.@ 2 ft ) in wingspan , smaller than their northern counterparts . The largest eagles are from Alaska , where large females may weigh up to 7 @.@ 5 kg ( 17 lb ) and span 2 @.@ 44 m ( 8 @.@ 0 ft ) across the wings . A survey of adult weights in Alaska showed that females weighed on average 6 @.@ 3 kg ( 14 lb ) and males weighed 4 @.@ 3 kg ( 9 @.@ 5 lb ) . Among standard linear measurements , the wing chord is 51 @.@ 5 – 69 cm ( 20 @.@ 3 – 27 @.@ 2 in ) , the tail is 23 – 37 cm ( 9 @.@ 1 – 14 @.@ 6 in ) long , and the tarsus is 8 to 11 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 to 4 @.@ 3 in ) . The culmen reportedly ranges from 3 to 7 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 3 @.@ 0 in ) , while the measurement from the gape to the tip of the bill is 7 – 9 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 – 3 @.@ 5 in ) . 
 The call consists of weak staccato , chirping whistles , <unk> <unk> ik ik ik , somewhat similar in cadence to a gull 's call . The calls of young birds tend to be more harsh and shrill than those of adults . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The bald eagle placed in the genus Haliaeetus ( sea eagles ) which gets both its common and specific scientific names from the distinctive appearance of the adult 's head . Bald in the English name is derived from the word piebald , and refers to the white head and tail feathers and their contrast with the darker body . The scientific name is derived from Haliaeetus , New Latin for " sea eagle " ( from the Ancient Greek <unk> ) , and leucocephalus , Latinized Ancient Greek for " white head , " from <unk> leukos ( " white " ) and κεφαλη kephale ( " head " ) . 
 The bald eagle was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his 18th century work Systema Naturae , under the name Falco leucocephalus . 
 There are two recognized subspecies of bald eagle : 
 H. l. leucocephalus ( Linnaeus , 1766 ) is the nominate subspecies . It is found in the southern United States and Baja California Peninsula . 
 H. l. <unk> ( Audubon , 1827 ) , synonym H. l. <unk> Townsend , 1897 , the northern subspecies , is larger than southern nominate leucocephalus . It is found in the northern United States , Canada and Alaska . 
 The bald eagle forms a species pair with the Eurasian white @-@ tailed eagle . This species pair consists of a white @-@ headed and a tan @-@ headed species of roughly equal size ; the white @-@ tailed eagle also has overall somewhat paler brown body plumage . The two species fill the same ecological niche in their respective ranges . The pair diverged from other sea eagles at the beginning of the Early Miocene ( c . 10 Ma BP ) at the latest , but possibly as early as the Early / Middle Oligocene , 28 Ma BP , if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to this genus . 
 = = Range = = 
 The bald eagle 's natural range covers most of North America , including most of Canada , all of the continental United States , and northern Mexico . It is the only sea eagle endemic to North America . Occupying varied habitats from the bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran Desert and the eastern deciduous forests of Quebec and New England , northern birds are migratory , while southern birds are resident , remaining on their breeding territory all year . At minimum population , in the 1950s , it was largely restricted to Alaska , the Aleutian Islands , northern and eastern Canada , and Florida . Today , they are much more common ( almost attaining their peak numbers pre @-@ colonization in North America ) , and nest in every continental state and province in the United States and Canada . 
 Bald eagles will also congregate in certain locations in winter . From November until February , one to two thousand birds winter in Squamish , British Columbia , about halfway between Vancouver and Whistler . The birds primarily gather along the Squamish and Cheakamus Rivers , attracted by the salmon spawning in the area . 
 It has occurred as a vagrant twice in Ireland ; a juvenile was shot illegally in Fermanagh on January 11 , 1973 ( misidentified at first as a white @-@ tailed eagle ) , and an exhausted juvenile was captured in Kerry on November 15 , 1987 . 
 = = Habitat = = 
 The bald eagle occurs during its breeding season in virtually any kind of American wetland habitat such as <unk> , rivers , large lakes or marshes or other large bodies of open water with an abundance of fish . Studies have shown a preference for bodies of water with a circumference greater than 11 km ( 7 mi ) , and lakes with an area greater than 10 km2 ( 4 sq mi ) are optimal for breeding bald eagles . 
 The bald eagle typically requires old @-@ growth and mature stands of coniferous or hardwood trees for perching , roosting , and nesting . Tree species reportedly is less important to the eagle pair than the tree 's height , composition and location . Perhaps of paramount importance for this species is an abundance of comparatively large trees surrounding the body of water . Selected trees must have good visibility , be over 20 m ( 66 ft ) tall , an open structure , and proximity to prey . If nesting trees are in standing water such as in a mangrove swamp , the nest can be located fairly low , at as low 6 m ( 20 ft ) above the ground . In a more typical tree standing on dry ground , nests may be located from 16 to 38 m ( 52 to 125 ft ) in height . In Chesapeake Bay , nesting trees averaged 82 cm ( 32 in ) in diameter and 28 m ( 92 ft ) in total height , while in Florida , the average nesting tree stands 23 m ( 75 ft ) high and is 23 cm ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) in diameter . Trees used for nesting in the Greater Yellowstone area average 27 m ( 89 ft ) high . Trees or forest used for nesting should have a canopy cover of no more than 60 % , and no less than 20 % , and be in close proximity to water . Most nests have been found within 200 m ( 660 ft ) of open water . The greatest distance from open water recorded for a bald eagle nest was over 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) , in Florida . 
 Bald eagle nests are often very large in order to compensate for size of the birds . The largest recorded nest was found in Florida in 1963 , and was measured at nearly 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep . 
 In Florida , nesting habitats often consist of mangrove swamps , the shorelines of lakes and rivers , pinelands , seasonally flooded flatwoods , hardwood swamps , and open prairies and pastureland with scattered tall trees . Favored nesting trees in Florida are slash pines ( Pinus elliottii ) , longleaf pines ( P. palustris ) , loblolly pines ( P. taeda ) and cypress trees , but for the southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used . In Wyoming , groves of mature cottonwoods or tall pines found along streams and rivers are typical bald eagle nesting habitats . Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large , old @-@ growth stands of ponderosa pines ( Pinus ponderosa ) to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland . In Southeast Alaska , Sitka spruce ( Picea sitchensis ) provided 78 % of the nesting trees used by eagles , followed by hemlocks ( Tsuga ) at 20 % . Increasingly , eagles nest in man @-@ made reservoirs stocked with fish . 
 The bald eagle is usually quite sensitive to human activity while nesting , and is found most commonly in areas with minimal human disturbance . It chooses sites more than 1 @.@ 2 km ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) from low @-@ density human disturbance and more than 1 @.@ 8 km ( 1 @.@ 1 mi ) from medium- to high @-@ density human disturbance . However , bald eagles will occasionally venture into large estuaries or secluded groves within major cities , such as Hardtack Island on the Willamette River in Portland , Oregon or John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , which are surrounded by a great quantity of human activity . Even more contrary to the usual sensitivity to disturbance , a family of bald eagles moved to the Harlem neighborhood in New York City in 2010 . 
 While wintering , bald eagles tend to be less habitat and disturbance sensitive . They will commonly congregate at spots with plentiful perches and waters with plentiful prey and ( in Northern climes ) partially unfrozen waters . Alternately , non @-@ breeding or wintering bald eagles , particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance , spend their time in various upland , terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways . In the northern half of North America ( especially the interior portion ) , this terrestrial <unk> by bald eagles tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not be accessible . Upland wintering habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium @-@ sized mammals , such as prairies , meadows or tundra , or open forests with regular carrion access . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 The bald eagle is a powerful flier , and soars on thermal convection currents . It reaches speeds of 56 – 70 km / h ( 35 – 43 mph ) when gliding and flapping , and about 48 km / h ( 30 mph ) while carrying fish . Its dive speed is between 120 – 160 km / h ( 75 – 99 mph ) , though it seldom dives vertically . It is partially migratory , depending on location . If its territory has access to open water , it remains there year @-@ round , but if the body of water freezes during the winter , making it impossible to obtain food , it migrates to the south or to the coast . A number of populations are subject to post @-@ breeding dispersal , mainly in juveniles ; Florida eagles , for example , will disperse northwards in the summer . The bald eagle selects migration routes which take advantage of thermals , updrafts , and food resources . During migration , it may ascend in a thermal and then glide down , or may ascend in updrafts created by the wind against a cliff or other terrain . Migration generally takes place during the daytime , usually between the local hours of 8 : 00 a.m. and 6 : 00 p.m. , when thermals are produced by the sun . 
 = = = Diet and feeding = = = 
 The bald eagle is an opportunistic carnivore with the capacity to consume a great variety of prey . Throughout their range , fish often comprise the majority of the eagle 's diet . In 20 food habit studies across the species ' range , fish comprised 56 % of the diet of nesting eagles , birds 28 % , mammals 14 % and other prey 2 % . In Southeast Alaska , fish comprise approximately 66 % of the year @-@ around diet of bald eagles and 78 % of the prey brought to the nest by the parents . Eagles living in the Columbia River Estuary in Oregon were found to rely on fish for 90 % of their dietary intake . In the Pacific Northwest , spawning trout and salmon provide most of the bald eagles ' diet from late summer throughout fall . Southeast Alaskan eagles largely prey on pink salmon ( Oncorhynchus <unk> ) , coho salmon ( O. kisutch ) and , more locally , sockeye salmon ( O. <unk> ) , with chinook salmon ( O. <unk> ) , due to their large size ( 12 to 18 kg ( 26 to 40 lb ) average adult size ) probably being taken only as carrion . Also important in the estuaries and shallow coastlines of southern Alaska are Pacific herring ( Clupea pallasii ) , Pacific sand lance ( Ammodytes <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> pacificus ) . In Oregon 's Columbia River Estuary , the most significant prey species were largescale suckers ( <unk> <unk> ) ( 17 @.@ 3 % of the prey selected there ) , American shad ( <unk> <unk> ; 13 % ) and common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ; 10 @.@ 8 % ) . Eagles living in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland were found to subsist largely on American gizzard shad ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> shad ( D. <unk> ) and white bass ( Morone chrysops ) . Floridian eagles have been reported to prey on catfish , mostly prevalently the brown bullhead ( <unk> <unk> ) and any species in the Ictalurus genus as well as mullet , trout , needlefish , and eels . Wintering eagles on the Platte River in Nebraska preyed mainly on American gizzard <unk> and common carp . From observation in the Columbia River , 58 % of the fish were caught live by the eagle , 24 % were scavenged as carcasses and 18 % were pirated away from other animals . 
 Even eagles living in relatively arid regions still typically rely primarily on fish as prey . In Sonora ( Mexico ) and Arizona , 77 % and over 73 % , respectively , of prey remains at the nests were from fish , largely various catfish and rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) . Prey fish targeted by bald eagles are often quite large . When experimenters offered fish of different sizes in the breeding season around Lake Britton in California , fish measuring 34 to 38 cm ( 13 to 15 in ) were taken 71 @.@ 8 % of the time by parent eagles while fish measuring 23 to 27 @.@ 5 cm ( 9 @.@ 1 to 10 @.@ 8 in ) were chosen only 25 % of the time . At nests around Lake Superior , the remains of fish ( mostly suckers ) were found to average 35 @.@ 4 cm ( 13 @.@ 9 in ) in total length . In the Columbia River estuary , most preyed on by eagles were estimated to measure between 30 and 60 cm ( 12 and 24 in ) in length , and carp flown with ( laboriously ) were up to 86 cm ( 34 in ) in length . 
 Benthic fishes such as catfish are usually consumed after they die and float to the surface , though while temporarily swimming in the open may be more vulnerable to predation than most fish since their eyes focus downwards . Bald eagles also regularly exploit water turbines which produce battered , stunned or dead fish easily consumed . Predators who leave behind scraps of dead fish that they kill , such as brown bears ( Ursus arctos ) , gray wolves ( Canis lupus ) and red foxes ( Vulpes vulpes ) , may be habitually followed in order to scavenge the kills secondarily . Once North Pacific salmon die off after spawning , usually local bald eagles eat salmon carcasses almost exclusively . Eagles in Washington need to consume 489 g ( 1 @.@ 078 lb ) of fish each day for survival , with adults generally consuming more than juveniles and thus reducing potential energy deficiency and increasing survival during winter . 
 Behind fish , the next most significant prey base for bald eagles are other waterbirds . The contribution of such birds to the eagle 's diet is variable , depending on the quantity and availability of fish near the water 's surface . Waterbirds can seasonally comprise from 7 % to 80 % of the prey selection for eagles in certain localities . Exceptionally , in the Greater Yellowstone area , birds were eaten as regularly as fish year @-@ around , with both prey groups comprising 43 % of the studied dietary intake . Preferred avian prey includes grebes , alcids , ducks , gulls , coots , herons , egrets , and geese . Bird species most preferred as prey by eagles tend to be medium @-@ sized , such as western grebes ( <unk> occidentalis ) , mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos ) and American coots ( Fulica americana ) as such prey is relatively easy for the much larger eagles to catch and fly with . American herring gull ( Larus <unk> ) are the favored avian prey species for eagles living around Lake Superior . Larger waterbirds are occasionally prey as well , with wintering emperor geese ( Chen <unk> ) and snow geese ( C. caerulescens ) , which gather in large groups , sometimes becoming regular prey . Other large waterbirds hunted at least occasionally by bald eagles have included common loons ( <unk> immer ) , great black @-@ backed gulls ( Larus marinus ) , sandhill cranes ( Grus canadensis ) , great blue herons ( Ardea herodias ) , Canada geese ( Branta canadensis ) , brown pelicans ( Pelecanus occidentalis ) , and fledging American white pelicans ( P. <unk> ) . Colony nesting seabirds , such as alcids , storm petrels , cormorants , northern gannets ( Morus bassanus ) , terns and gulls , may be especially vulnerable to predation . Due to easy accessibility and lack of formidable nest defense by such species , bald eagles are capable of preying on such seabirds at all ages , from eggs to mature adults , and can effectively cull large portions of a colony . 
 Along some portions of the North Pacific coastline , bald eagles which had historically preyed mainly kelp @-@ dwelling fish and <unk> sea otter ( Enhydra lutris ) pups are now preying mainly on seabird colonies since both the fish ( possibly due to overfishing ) and otters ( cause unknown ) have had <unk> population declines , causing concern for seabird conservation . Because of this more extensive predation , some biologist have expressed concern that murres are heading for a " conservation collision " due to heavy eagle predation . Eagles have been confirmed to attack nocturnally active , burrow @-@ nesting seabird species such as storm petrels and shearwaters by digging out their burrows and feeding on all animals they find inside . If a bald eagle flies close by , waterbirds will often fly away en masse , though in other cases they may seemingly ignore a perched eagle . If the said birds are on a colony , this exposed their unprotected eggs and nestlings to scavengers such as gulls . Bird prey may occasionally be attacked in flight , with prey up to the size of Canada geese attacked and killed in mid @-@ air . Unprecedented photographs of a bald eagle unsuccessfully attempting to prey on a much larger adult trumpeter swan ( Cygnus buccinator ) in mid @-@ flight were taken recently . While adults often actively prey on waterbirds , congregated wintering waterfowl are frequently exploited for carcasses to scavenge by immature eagles in harsh winter weather . Bald eagles have been recorded as killing other raptors on occasion . In some cases , these may be attacks of competition or kleptoparasitism on rival species but ended with the consumption of the victim . <unk> birds reported to be hunted by these eagles have included large adults of species such as red @-@ tailed hawks ( Buteo jamaicensis ) , ospreys ( Pandion haliaetus ) and black ( Coragyps atratus ) and turkey vultures ( Cathartes aura ) . 
 Mammalian prey includes rabbits , hares , ground squirrels , raccoons ( Procyon lotor ) , muskrats ( Ondatra zibethicus ) , beavers ( Castor canadensis ) , and deer fawns . Newborn , dead , sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted . However , more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked . In the Chesapeake Bay area , bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons . Where available , seal colonies can provide much food . On Protection Island , Washington , they commonly feed on harbor seal ( Phoca <unk> ) <unk> , still @-@ <unk> and sickly seal pups . On San Juan Island in Washington , introduced European rabbits ( Oryctolagus cuniculus ) , mainly those killed by auto accidents , comprise nearly 60 % of the dietary intake of eagles . In landlocked areas of North America , wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium @-@ sized mammals that occur in colonies or local concentrations , such as prairie dogs ( <unk> ) and jackrabbits ( Lepus ) . Together with the golden eagle , bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock , especially sheep ( Ovis aries ) . There are a handful of proven cases of lamb predation , some of specimens weighing up to 11 kg ( 24 lb ) , by bald eagles but they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native , wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods . There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult , pregnant ewe ( then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles ) , which , weighing on average over 60 kg ( 130 lb ) , is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species . 
 Supplemental prey are readily taken given the opportunity . In some areas reptiles may become regular prey , especially warm areas such as Florida where reptile diversity is high . Turtles are perhaps the most regularly hunted type of reptile . In coastal New Jersey , 14 of 20 studied eagle nests included remains of turtles . The main species found were common musk turtles ( <unk> odoratus ) , diamondback terrapin ( <unk> terrapin ) and juvenile common snapping turtles ( Chelydra serpentina ) . In these New Jersey nests , mainly subadult and small adults were taken , ranging in carapace length from 9 @.@ 2 to 17 @.@ 1 cm ( 3 @.@ 6 to 6 @.@ 7 in ) . Snakes are also taken occasionally , especially partially aquatic ones , as are amphibians and crustaceans ( largely crayfish and crabs ) . 
 To hunt fish , the eagle swoops down over the water and snatches the fish out of the water with its talons . They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other . Eagles have structures on their toes called spicules that allow them to grasp fish . Osprey also have this adaptation . Bald eagles have powerful talons and have been recorded flying with a 6 @.@ 8 kg ( 15 lb ) mule deer ( Odocoileus hemionus ) fawn . This feat is the record for the heaviest load carrying ever verified for a flying bird . It has been estimated that the gripping power ( pounds by square inch ) of the bald eagle is ten times greater than that of a human . Bald eagles can fly with fish at least equal to their own weight , but if the fish is too heavy to lift , the eagle may be dragged into the water . It may swim to safety , in some cases pulling the catch along to the shore as it swims , but some eagles drown or succumb to hypothermia . Many sources claim that bald eagles , like all large eagles , cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions . On numerous occasions , when large prey such as mature salmon or geese are attacked , eagles have been seen to make contact and then drag the prey in a strenuously labored , low flight over the water to a bank , where they then finish off and dismember the prey . When food is abundant , an eagle can gorge itself by storing up to 1 kg ( 2 @.@ 2 lb ) of food in a pouch in the throat called a crop . <unk> allows the bird to fast for several days if food becomes unavailable . Occasionally , bald eagles may hunt cooperatively when confronting prey , especially relatively large prey such as jackrabbits or herons , with one bird distracting potential prey , while the other comes behind it in order to ambush it . While hunting waterfowl , bald eagles repeatedly fly at a target and cause it to dive repeatedly , hoping to exhaust the victim so it can be caught ( white @-@ tailed eagles have been recorded hunting waterfowl in the same way ) . When hunting concentrated prey , a successful catch which often results in the hunting eagle being pursued by other eagles and needing to find an isolated perch for consumption if it is able to carry it away successfully . 
 Unlike some other eagle species , bald eagles rarely take on evasive or dangerous prey on their own . The species mainly target prey which is much smaller than themselves , with most live fish caught weighing 1 to 3 kg ( 2 @.@ 2 to 6 @.@ 6 lb ) and most waterbirds preyed weighing 0 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 7 kg ( 0 @.@ 44 to 5 @.@ 95 lb ) . They obtain much of their food as carrion or via a practice known as kleptoparasitism , by which they steal prey away from other predators . Due to their dietary habits , bald eagles are frequently viewed in a negative light by humans . Thanks to their superior foraging ability and experience , adults are generally more likely to hunt live prey than immature eagles , which often obtain their food from scavenging . They are not very selective about the condition or origin , whether provided by humans , other animals , auto accidents or natural causes , of a carcass 's presence , but will avoid eating carrion where disturbances from humans are a regular occurrence . They will scavenge carcasses up to the size of whales , though carcasses of ungulates and large fish are seemingly preferred . Bald eagles also may sometimes feed on material scavenged or stolen from campsites and picnics , as well as garbage dumps ( dump usage is habitual mainly in Alaska ) . 
 When competing for food , eagles will usually dominate other fish @-@ eaters and scavengers , aggressively displacing mammals such as coyotes ( Canis latrans ) and foxes , and birds such as corvids , gulls , vultures and other raptors . Occasionally , coyotes , bobcats ( Lynx rufus ) and domestic dogs ( Canis lupus familiaris ) can displace eagles from carrion , usually less confident immature birds , as has been recorded in Maine . Bald eagles are less active , bold predators than golden eagles and get relatively more of their food as carrion and from kleptoparasitism ( although it is now generally thought that golden eagles eat more carrion than was previously assumed ) . However , the two species are roughly equal in size , aggressiveness and physical strength and so competitions can go either way . Neither species is known to be dominant , and the outcome depends on the size and disposition of the individual eagles involved . The bald eagle is thought to be much more numerous in North America than the golden eagle , with the bald species estimated to number at least 150 @,@ 000 individuals , about twice as many golden eagles there are estimated to live in North America . Due to this , bald eagles often outnumber golden eagles at attractive food sources . Despite the potential for contention between these animals , in New Jersey during winter , a golden eagle and numerous bald eagles were observed to hunt snow geese alongside each other without conflict . Similarly , both eagle species have been recorded , via video @-@ monitoring , to feed on gut pills and carcasses of white @-@ tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) in remote forest clearings in the eastern Appalachian Mountains without apparent conflict . Many bald eagles are habitual kleptoparasites , especially in winters when fish are harder to come by . They have been recorded stealing fish from other predators such as ospreys , herons and even otters . They have also been recorded opportunistically pirating birds from peregrine falcons ( Falco peregrinus ) , prairie dogs from ferruginous hawks ( Buteo regalis ) and even jackrabbits from golden eagles . When they approach scavengers like dogs , gulls or vultures at carrion sites , they often aggressively attack them and try to force them to disgorge their food . Healthy adult bald eagles are not preyed on in the wild and are thus considered apex predators . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Bald eagles are sexually mature at four or five years of age . When they are old enough to breed , they often return to the area where they were born . It is thought that bald eagles mate for life . However , if one member of a pair dies or disappears , the other will choose a new mate . A pair which has repeatedly failed in breeding attempts may split and look for new mates . Bald eagle courtship involves elaborate , spectacular calls and flight displays . The flight includes swoops , chases , and cartwheels , in which they fly high , lock talons , and free fall , separating just before hitting the ground . Usually , a territory defended by a mature pair will be 1 to 2 km ( 0 @.@ 62 to 1 @.@ 24 mi ) of waterside habitat . 
 Compared to most other raptors which mostly nest in April or May , bald eagles are early breeders : nest building or reinforcing is often by mid @-@ February , egg laying is often late February ( sometimes during deep snow in the North ) , and incubation is usually mid @-@ March and early May . Eggs hatch from mid April to early May , and the young fledge late June to early July . The nest is the largest of any bird in North America ; it is used repeatedly over many years and with new material added each year may eventually be as large as 4 m ( 13 ft ) deep , 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) across and weigh 1 metric ton ( 1 @.@ 1 short tons ) ; one nest in Florida was found to be 6 @.@ 1 m ( 20 ft ) deep , 2 @.@ 9 meters ( 9 @.@ 5 ft ) across , and to weigh 3 short tons ( 2 @.@ 7 metric tons ) . This nest is on record as the largest tree nest ever recorded for any animal . Usually nests are used for under five years or so , as they either collapse in storms or break the branches supporting them by their sheer weight . However , one nest in the Midwest was occupied continuously for at least 34 years . The nest is built out of branches , usually in large trees found near water . When breeding where there are no trees , the bald eagle will nest on the ground , as has been recorded largely in areas largely isolated from terrestrial predators , such as Amchitka Island in Alaska . In Sonora , Mexico , eagles have been observed nesting on top of Hecho <unk> ( Pachycereus <unk> ) . Nests located on cliffs and rock pinnacles have been reported historically in California , Kansas , Nevada , New Mexico and Utah , but currently are only verified to occur only in Alaska and Arizona . The eggs average about 73 mm ( 2 @.@ 9 in ) long , ranging from 58 to 85 mm ( 2 @.@ 3 to 3 @.@ 3 in ) , and have a breadth of 54 mm ( 2 @.@ 1 in ) , ranging from 47 to 63 cm ( 19 to 25 in ) . Eggs in Alaska averaged 130 g ( 4 @.@ 6 oz ) in mass , while in Saskatchewan they averaged 114 @.@ 4 g ( 4 @.@ 04 oz ) . As with their ultimate body size , egg size tends to increase further away from the Equator . Eagles produce between one and three eggs per year , two being typical . Rarely , four eggs have been found in nests but these may be exceptional cases of polygyny . Eagles in captivity have been capable of producing up to seven <unk> it is rare for all three chicks to successfully reach the fledging stage . The oldest chick often bears the advantage of larger size and louder voice , which tends to draw the parents attention towards it . Occasionally , as is recorded in many large raptorial birds , the oldest sibling sometimes attacks and kills its younger sibling ( s ) , especially early in the nesting period when their sizes are most different . However , nearly half of known bald eagle produce two <unk> ( more rarely three ) , unlike in some other " eagle " species such as some in the Aquila genus , in which a second fledging is typically observed in less than 20 % of nests , despite two eggs typically being laid . Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs , but the female does most of the sitting . The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting material during this stage . For the first two to three weeks of the nestling period , at least one adult is at the nest almost 100 % of the time . After five to six weeks , the attendance of parents usually drops off considerably ( with the parents often perching in trees nearby ) . A young eaglet can gain up to 170 g ( 6 @.@ 0 oz ) a day , the fastest growth rate of any North American bird . The young <unk> pick up and manipulate sticks , play tug of war with each other , practice holding things in their talons , and stretch and flap their wings . By eight weeks , the <unk> are strong enough to flap their wings , lift their feet off the nest platform , and rise up in the air . The young fledge at anywhere from 8 to 14 weeks of age , though will remain close to the nest and attended to by their parents for a further 6 weeks . Juvenile eagles first start dispersing away from their parents about 8 weeks after they fledge . Variability in departure date related to effects of sex and hatching order on growth and development . For the next four years , immature eagles wander widely in search of food until they attain adult plumage and are eligible to reproduce . 
 = = = Longevity and mortality = = = 
 The average lifespan of bald eagles in the wild is around 20 years , with the oldest confirmed one having been 38 years of age . In captivity , they often live somewhat longer . In one instance , a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years . As with size , the average lifespan of an eagle population appears to be influenced by its location and access to prey . As they are no longer heavily persecuted , adult mortality is quite low . In one study of Florida eagles , adult bald eagles reportedly had 100 % annual survival rate . In Prince William Sound in Alaska , adults had an annual survival rate of 88 % even after the Exxon Valdez oil spill adversely affected eagles in the area . Of 1 @,@ 428 individuals from across the range <unk> by National Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984 , 329 ( 23 % ) eagles died from trauma , primarily impact with wires and vehicles ; 309 ( 22 % ) died from gunshot ; 158 ( 11 % ) died from poisoning ; 130 ( 9 % ) died from electrocution ; 68 ( 5 % ) died from trapping ; 110 ( 8 % ) from emaciation ; and 31 ( 2 % ) from disease ; cause of death was undetermined in 293 ( 20 % ) of cases . In this study , 68 % of mortality was human @-@ caused . Today eagle @-@ shooting is believed to be considerably reduced due to the species protected status . In one case , an adult eagle investigating a peregrine falcon nest for prey items sustained a concussion from a swooping parent peregrine , and ultimately died days later from it . An early natural history video depicting a cougar ( Puma concolor ) ambushing and killing an immature bald eagle feeding at a rabbit carcass is viewable online although this film may have been staged . 
 Most non @-@ human @-@ related mortality involves nestlings or eggs . Around 50 % of eagles survive their first year . However , in the Chesapeake Bay area , 100 % of 39 radio @-@ tagged nestlings survived to their first year . Occasionally , nestling or egg fatalities are due to nest collapses , starvation , sibling aggression or inclement weather . Another significant cause of egg and nestling mortality is predation . These have been verified to be preyed by large gulls , corvids ( including ravens , crows and magpies ) , wolverines ( <unk> <unk> ) , hawks , owls , eagles , bobcats ( Lynx rufus ) , American black bears ( Ursus americanus ) and raccoons . If food access is low , parental attendance at the nest may be lower because both parents may have to forage thus resulting in less protection . Nestlings are usually exempt from predation by terrestrial carnivores that are poor tree @-@ climbers , but Arctic foxes ( Vulpes lagopus ) occasionally snatched nestlings from ground nests on Amchitka Island in Alaska before they were extirpated from the island . The bald eagle will defend its nest fiercely from all comers and has even repelled attacks from bears , having been recorded knocking a black bear out of a tree when the latter tried to climb a tree holding nestlings .

 Once a common sight in much of the continent , the bald eagle was severely affected in the mid @-@ 20th century by a variety of factors , among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide DDT . Bald eagles , like many birds of prey , were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification . DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird , but it interfered with the bird 's calcium metabolism , making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs . Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult , making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch . It is estimated that in the early 18th century , the bald eagle population was 300 @,@ 000 – 500 @,@ 000 , but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 contiguous states of the US . Other factors in bald eagle population reductions were a widespread loss of suitable habitat , as well as both legal and illegal shooting . In 1930 a New York City ornithologist wrote that in the state of Alaska in the previous 12 years approximately 70 @,@ 000 bald eagles had been shot . Many of the hunters killed the bald eagles under the long @-@ held beliefs that bald eagles grabbed young lambs and even children with their talons , yet the birds were innocent of most of these alleged acts of predation ( lamb predation is rare , human predation is thought to be non @-@ existent ) . Later illegal shooting was described as " the leading cause of direct mortality in both adult and immature bald eagles , " according to a 1978 report in the Endangered Species Technical Bulletin . In 1984 , the National Wildlife Federation listed hunting , power @-@ line electrocution , and collisions in flight as the leading causes of eagle deaths . Bald eagles have also been killed by oil , lead , and mercury pollution , and by human and predator intrusion at nests . 
 The species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty , later extended to all of North America . The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act , approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940 , protected the bald eagle and the golden eagle , prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds . The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967 , and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators . Perhaps most significant in the species ' recovery , in 1972 , DDT was banned from usage in the United States . DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989 , though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s . 
 With regulations in place and DDT banned , the eagle population rebounded . The bald eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada , particularly near large bodies of water . In the early 1980s , the estimated total population was 100 @,@ 000 individuals , with 110 @,@ 000 – 115 @,@ 000 by 1992 ; the U.S. state with the largest resident population is Alaska , with about 40 @,@ 000 – 50 @,@ 000 , with the next highest population the Canadian province of British Columbia with 20 @,@ 000 – 30 @,@ 000 in 1992 . Obtaining a precise count of bald eagles population is extremely difficult . The most recent data submitted by individual states was in 2006 , when <unk> breeding pairs were reported . For some time , the stronghold breeding population of bald eagles in the lower 48 states was in Florida , where over a thousand pairs have held on while populations in other states were significantly reduced by DDT use . Today , the contiguous state with the largest number of breeding pairs of eagles is Minnesota with an estimated 1 @,@ 312 pairs , surpassing Florida 's most recent count of 1 @,@ 166 pairs . 23 , or nearly half , of the 48 contiguous states now have at least 100 breeding pairs of bald eagles . In Washington State , there were only 105 occupied nests in 1980 . That number increased by about 30 per year , so that by 2005 there were 840 occupied nests . 2005 was the last year that the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife counted occupied nest . Further population increases in Washington may limited by the availability of late winter food , particularly salmon . 
 The bald eagle was officially removed from the U.S. federal government 's list of endangered species on July 12 , 1995 , by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service , when it was reclassified from " Endangered " to " Threatened . " On July 6 , 1999 , a proposal was initiated " To Remove the Bald Eagle in the Lower 48 States From the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife . " It was de @-@ listed on June 28 , 2007 . It has also been assigned a risk level of Least Concern category on the IUCN Red List . In the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill of 1989 an estimated 247 were killed in Prince William Sound , though the local population returned to its pre @-@ spill level by 1995 . 
 = = = In captivity = = = 
 Permits are required to keep bald eagles in captivity in the United States . Permits are primarily issued to public educational institutions , and the eagles which they show are permanently injured individuals which cannot be released to the wild . The facilities where eagles are kept must be equipped with adequate caging and facilities , as well as workers experienced in the handling and care of eagles . Bald eagles cannot legally be kept for falconry in the United States . As a rule , the bald eagle is a poor choice for public shows , being timid , prone to becoming highly stressed , and unpredictable in nature . Native American tribes can obtain a " Native American Religious Use " permit to keep non @-@ releasable eagles as well . They use their naturally molted feathers for religious and cultural ceremonies . The bald eagle can be long @-@ lived in captivity if well cared for , but does not breed well even under the best conditions . In Canada , a license is required to keep bald eagles for falconry . 
 = = Cultural significance = = 
 The bald eagle is important in various Native American cultures and , as the national bird of the United States , is prominent in seals and logos , coinage , postage stamps , and other items relating to the U.S. federal government . 
 = = = Role in Native American culture = = = 
 The bald eagle is a sacred bird in some North American cultures , and its feathers , like those of the golden eagle , are central to many religious and spiritual customs among Native Americans . Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures . Many pow wow dancers use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well . Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies , particularly in the construction of regalia worn and as a part of fans , bustles and head dresses . In the Navajo Tradition an Eagle feather is represented to be a Protector , along with the Feather Navajo Medicine Man use the leg and wing bones for ceremonial whistles . The Lakota , for instance , give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task . In modern times , it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college . The Pawnee considered eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young . The Choctaw considered the bald eagle , who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun , as a symbol of peace . 
 During the Sun Dance , which is practiced by many Plains Indian tribes , the eagle is represented in several ways . The eagle nest is represented by the fork of the lodge where the dance is held . A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used during the course of the dance . Also during the dance , a medicine man may direct his fan , which is made of eagle feathers , to people who seek to be healed . The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient , in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient . The fan is then held up toward the sky , so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator . 
 Current eagle feather law stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain or possess bald or golden eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use . The constitutionality of these laws has been questioned by Native American groups on the basis that it violates the First Amendment by affecting ability to practice their religion freely . 
 The National Eagle Repository , a division of the FWS , exists as a means to receive , process , and store bald and golden eagles which are found dead , and to distribute the eagles , their parts and feathers , to federally recognized Native American tribes for use in religious ceremonies . 
 = = = National bird of the United States = = = 
 The bald eagle is the national bird of the United States of America . The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the Roman Republic , in which eagle imagery ( usually involving the golden eagle ) was prominent . On June 20 , 1782 , the Continental Congress adopted the design for the Great Seal of the United States depicting a bald eagle grasping 13 arrows and an olive branch with its talons . 
 The bald eagle appears on most official seals of the U.S. government , including the presidential seal , the presidential flag , and in the logos of many U.S. federal agencies . Between 1916 and 1945 , the presidential flag ( but not the seal ) showed an eagle facing to its left ( the viewer 's right ) , which gave rise to the urban legend that the flag is changed to have the eagle face towards the olive branch in peace , and towards the arrows in wartime . 
 Contrary to popular legend , there is no evidence that Benjamin Franklin ever publicly supported the wild turkey ( Meleagris gallopavo ) , rather than the bald eagle , as a symbol of the United States . However , in a letter written to his daughter in 1784 from Paris , criticizing the Society of the Cincinnati , he stated his personal distaste for the bald eagle 's behavior . In the letter Franklin states : 
 For my own part . I wish the bald eagle had not been chosen the representative of our country . He is a bird of bad moral character . He does not get his living honestly ... besides he is a rank coward : The little king bird not bigger than a sparrow attacks him boldly and drives him out of the district . 
 Franklin opposed the creation of the Society because he viewed it , with its hereditary membership , as a noble order unwelcome in the newly independent Republic , contrary to the ideals of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus , for whom the Society was named ; his reference to the two kinds of birds is interpreted as a satirical comparison between the Society of the Cincinnati and Cincinnatus .

 = Bratislava = 
 Bratislava ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ; Slovak pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ; also known by other names ) is the capital of Slovakia , and with a population of about 450 @,@ 000 , the country 's largest city . The greater metropolitan area is home to more than 650 @,@ 000 people . Bratislava is in southwestern Slovakia , occupying both banks of the River Danube and the left bank of the River Morava . Bordering Austria and Hungary , it is the only national capital that borders two independent countries . 
 Bratislava is the political , cultural and economic centre of Slovakia . It is the seat of the Slovak president , the parliament and the Slovak Executive . It is home to several universities , museums , theatres , galleries and other important cultural and educational institutions . Many of Slovakia 's large businesses and financial institutions also have headquarters there . 
 The history of the city has been strongly influenced by people of different nations and religions , namely by Austrians , Croats , Czechs , Germans , Hungarians , Jews , Serbs and Slovaks ( in alphabetical order ) . The city was the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary , a part of the larger Habsburg Monarchy territories , from 1536 to 1783 and has been home to many Slovak , Hungarian and German historical figures . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The city received its contemporary name in 1919 . Beforehand it was mostly known in English by its German name , Pressburg , as it was long dominated by Austrians and other German @-@ speakers . This is the term which the German , the pre @-@ 1919 Slovak ( <unk> ) and Czech ( <unk> ) names are derived from . The origin of the city 's Hungarian name , Pozsony , is unclear : it might come from the Hungarian Poson ( name of the city 's first castellan ) , the Czech Pos or the German <unk> , which are personal names . Hungarian speakers still use the Hungarian name , Pozsony . 
 The medieval settlement Brezalauspurc ( literally : Braslav 's castle ) is sometimes attributed to Bratislava , however the actual location of Brezalauspurc is under scholarly debate . The city 's modern name is credited to Pavel Jozef <unk> 's misinterpretation of Braslav as Bratislav when analyzing medieval sources , thus coming up with the term <unk> , later Bratislav . 
 During the revolution of 1918 – 1919 , the name ' <unk> ' or ' <unk> ' ( after President Woodrow Wilson ) was proposed by American Slovaks , as he supported national self @-@ determination . The name Bratislava , which was used before only by some Slovak patriots , became official in March 1919 . 
 Other alternative names of the city in the past include Greek : <unk> <unk> ( meaning " Danube City " , also used in Latin ) , Czech : <unk> , French : <unk> , Italian : <unk> , Latin : <unk> , Romanian : <unk> and Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> / <unk> . The name Pressburg was also used in English @-@ language publications until 1919 , and it is occasionally used today . 
 In older documents , confusion can be caused by the Latin forms <unk> , <unk> etc . , which refer to Wrocław , Poland – not to Bratislava . 
 = = History = = 
 The first known permanent settlement of the area began with the Linear Pottery Culture , around 5000 BC in the Neolithic era . About 200 BC , the Celtic <unk> tribe founded the first significant settlement , a fortified town known as an oppidum . They also established a mint , producing silver coins known as <unk> . 
 The area fell under Roman influence from the 1st to the 4th century AD and was made part of the Danubian Limes , a border defence system . The Romans introduced grape growing to the area and began a tradition of winemaking , which survives to the present . 
 The Slavs arrived from the East between the 5th and 6th centuries during the Migration Period . As a response to onslaughts by Avars , the local Slavic tribes rebelled and established Samo 's Empire ( 623 – 658 ) , the first known Slavic political entity . In the 9th century , the castles at Bratislava ( Brezalauspurc ) and Devín ( <unk> ) were important centres of the Slavic states : the Principality of Nitra and Great Moravia . Scholars have debated the identification as fortresses of the two castles built in Great Moravia , based on linguistic arguments and because of the absence of convincing archaeological evidence . 
 The first written reference to a settlement named " Brezalauspurc " dates to 907 and is related to the Battle of Pressburg , during which a Bavarian army was defeated by the Hungarians . It is connected to the fall of Great Moravia , already weakened by its own inner decline and under the attacks of the Hungarians . The exact location of the battle remains unknown , and some interpretations place it west of Lake Balaton . 
 In the 10th century , the territory of Pressburg ( what would later become Pozsony county ) became part of Hungary ( called " the Kingdom of Hungary " from 1000 ) . It developed as a key economic and administrative centre on the kingdom 's frontier . This strategic position destined the city to be the site of frequent attacks and battles , but also brought it economic development and high political status . It was granted its first known " town privileges " in 1291 by the Hungarian King Andrew III , and was declared a free royal town in 1405 by King Sigismund . In 1436 he authorized the town to use its own coat of arms . 
 The Kingdom of Hungary was defeated by the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Mohács in 1526 . The Turks besieged and damaged Pressburg , but failed to conquer it . Owing to Ottoman advances into Hungarian territory , the city was designated the new capital of Hungary in 1536 , becoming part of the Austrian Habsburg monarchy and marking the beginning of a new era . The city became a coronation town and the seat of kings , archbishops ( 1543 ) , the nobility and all major organisations and offices . Between 1536 and 1830 , eleven Hungarian kings and queens were crowned at St. Martin 's Cathedral . The 17th century was marked by anti @-@ Habsburg uprisings , fighting with the Turks , floods , plagues and other disasters , which diminished the population . 
 Pressburg flourished during the 18th @-@ century reign of Queen Maria Theresa , becoming the largest and most important town in Hungary . The population tripled ; many new palaces , monasteries , mansions , and streets were built , and the city was the centre of social and cultural life of the region . Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart gave a concert in 1762 in the Pálffy Palace . Joseph Haydn performed in 1784 in the <unk> Palace . Ludwig van Beethoven was a guest in 1796 in the <unk> Palace . 
 The city started to lose its importance under the reign of Maria Theresa 's son Joseph II , especially after the crown jewels were taken to Vienna in 1783 in an attempt to strengthen the union between Austria and Hungary . Many central offices subsequently moved to Buda , followed by a large segment of the nobility . The first newspapers in Hungarian and Slovak were published here : Magyar <unk> in 1780 , and <unk> Nowiny in 1783 . In the course of the 18th century , the city became a centre for the Slovak national movement . 
 The city 's 19th @-@ century history was closely tied to the major events in Europe . The Peace of Pressburg between Austria and France was signed here in 1805 . <unk> Castle was ruined by Napoleon 's French troops during an invasion of 1809 . In 1825 the Hungarian National Learned Society ( the present Hungarian Academy of Sciences ) was founded in Pressburg using a donation from István Széchenyi . In 1843 Hungarian was proclaimed the official language in legislation , public administration and education by the Diet in the city . 
 As a reaction to the Revolutions of 1848 , Ferdinand V signed the so @-@ called April laws , which included the abolition of serfdom , at the Primate 's Palace . The city chose the revolutionary Hungarian side , but was captured by the Austrians in December 1848 . 
 Industry developed rapidly in the 19th century . The first horse @-@ drawn railway in the Kingdom of Hungary , from Pressburg to <unk> Svätý <unk> , was built in 1840 . A new line to Vienna using steam locomotives was opened in 1848 , and a line to Pest in 1850 . Many new industrial , financial and other institutions were founded ; for example , the first bank in present @-@ day Slovakia was founded in 1842 . The city 's first permanent bridge over the Danube , Starý most , was built in 1891 . 
 Before World War I , the city had a population that was 42 % ethnic German , 41 % Hungarian and 15 % Slovak ( 1910 census ) . After World War I and the formation of Czechoslovakia on October 28 , 1918 , the city was incorporated into the new state despite its representatives ' reluctance . The dominant Hungarian and German population tried to prevent annexation of the city to Czechoslovakia and declared it a free city . However , the Czechoslovak Legions occupied the city on January 1 , 1919 , and made it part of Czechoslovakia . The city became the seat of Slovakia 's political organs and organizations and became Slovakia 's capital on 4 February . On February 12 , 1919 the German and Hungarian population started a protest against the Czechoslovak occupation , but the Czechoslovak Legions opened fire on the unarmed demonstrators . 
 On March 27 , 1919 , the name Bratislava was officially adopted for the first time . Left without any protection after the retreat of the Hungarian army , many Hungarians were expelled or fled . Czechs and Slovaks moved their households to Bratislava . Education in Hungarian and German was radically reduced in the city . By the 1930 Czechoslovakian census , the Hungarian population of Bratislava had decreased to 15 @.@ 8 % ( see the Demographics of Bratislava article for more details ) . 
 In 1938 , Nazi Germany annexed neighbouring Austria in the Anschluss ; later that year it also annexed the still @-@ separate from Bratislava Petržalka and Devín boroughs on ethnic grounds , as these had many ethnic Germans . Bratislava was declared the capital of the first independent Slovak Republic on March 14 , 1939 , but the new state quickly fell under Nazi influence . In 1941 – 1942 and 1944 – 1945 , the new Slovak government cooperated in deporting most of Bratislava 's approximately 15 @,@ 000 Jews ; they were transported to concentration camps , where most were killed or died before the end of the war . 
 Bratislava was bombarded by the Allies , occupied by German troops in 1944 , and eventually taken by troops of the Soviet 2nd Ukrainian Front on 4 April 1945 . At the end of World War II , most of Bratislava 's ethnic Germans were helped to evacuate by the German authorities . A few returned after the war , but were soon expelled without their properties under the Beneš decrees , part of a widespread expulsion of ethnic Germans from eastern Europe . 
 After the Communist Party seized power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948 , the city became part of the Eastern Bloc . The city annexed new land , and the population rose significantly , becoming 90 % Slovak . Large residential areas consisting of high @-@ rise prefabricated panel buildings , such as those in the Petržalka borough , were built . The Communist government also built several new grandiose buildings , such as the Most <unk> <unk> <unk> bridge and the Slovak Radio headquarters . 
 In 1968 , after the unsuccessful Czechoslovak attempt to liberalise the Communist regime , the city was occupied by Warsaw Pact troops . Shortly thereafter , it became capital of the Slovak Socialist Republic , one of the two states of the federalized Czechoslovakia . 
 Bratislava 's dissidents anticipated the fall of Communism with the Bratislava candle demonstration in 1988 , and the city became one of the foremost centres of the anti @-@ Communist Velvet Revolution in 1989 . 
 In 1993 , the city became the capital of the newly formed Slovak Republic following the Velvet Divorce . In the 1990s and the early 21st century , its economy boomed due to foreign investment . The city has also hosted several important cultural and political events . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Bratislava is situated in south @-@ western Slovakia , within the Bratislava Region . Its location on the borders with Austria and Hungary makes it the only national capital that borders two countries . It is only 62 kilometres ( 38 @.@ 5 mi ) from the border with the Czech Republic and only 60 kilometres ( 37 @.@ 3 mi ) from the Austrian capital Vienna . 
 The city has a total area of 367 @.@ 58 square kilometres ( 141 @.@ 9 sq mi ) , making it the second @-@ largest city in Slovakia by area ( after the township of Vysoké Tatry ) . Bratislava straddles the Danube River , which it had developed around and for centuries was the chief transportation route to other areas . The river passes through the city from the west to the south @-@ east . The Middle Danube basin begins at Devín Gate in western Bratislava . Other rivers are the Morava River , which forms the north @-@ western border of the city and enters the Danube at Devín , the Little Danube , and the <unk> , which enters the Danube in the borough of <unk> Ves . 
 The Carpathian mountain range begins in city territory with the Little Carpathians ( <unk> Karpaty ) . The <unk> and Danubian lowlands stretch into Bratislava . The city 's lowest point is at the Danube 's surface at 126 metres ( 413 ft ) above mean sea level , and the highest point is <unk> <unk> at 514 metres ( 1 @,@ 686 ft ) . The average altitude is 140 metres ( 460 ft ) .

 = = Cityscape and architecture = = 
 The cityscape of Bratislava is characterised by medieval towers and grandiose 20th @-@ century buildings , but it has undergone profound changes in a construction boom at the start of the 21st century . 
 Most historical buildings are concentrated in the Old Town . Bratislava 's Town Hall is a complex of three buildings erected in the 14th – 15th centuries and now hosts the Bratislava City Museum . Michael 's Gate is the only gate that has been preserved from the medieval fortifications , and it ranks among the oldest of the town 's buildings ; the narrowest house in Europe is nearby . The University Library building , erected in 1756 , was used by the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1802 to 1848 . Much of the significant legislation of the Hungarian Reform Era ( such as the abolition of serfdom and the foundation of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences ) was enacted there . 
 The historic centre is characterised by many baroque palaces . The <unk> Palace , built around 1760 , is now the residence of the Slovak president , and the Slovak government now has its seat in the former <unk> Palace . In 1805 , diplomats of emperors Napoleon and Francis II signed the fourth Peace of Pressburg in the Primate 's Palace , after Napoleon 's victory in the Battle of Austerlitz . Some smaller houses are historically significant ; composer Johann Nepomuk Hummel was born in an 18th @-@ century house in the Old Town . 
 Notable cathedrals and churches include the Gothic St. Martin 's Cathedral built in the 13th – 16th centuries , which served as the coronation church of the Kingdom of Hungary between 1563 and 1830 . The Franciscan Church , dating to the 13th century , has been a place of knighting ceremonies and is the oldest preserved sacral building in the city . The Church of St. Elizabeth , better known as the Blue Church due to its colour , is built entirely in the Hungarian Secessionist style . 
 A curiosity is the underground ( formerly ground @-@ level ) restored portion of the Jewish cemetery where 19th @-@ century Rabbi Moses <unk> is buried , located at the base of the castle hill near the entrance to a tram tunnel . The only military cemetery in Bratislava is <unk> , unveiled in 1960 in honour of Soviet Army soldiers who fell during the liberation of Bratislava in April 1945 . It offers an excellent view of the city and the Little Carpathians . 
 Other prominent 20th @-@ century structures include the Most <unk> <unk> <unk> ( Bridge of the Slovak national uprising ) across the Danube featuring a UFO @-@ like tower restaurant , Slovak Radio 's inverted @-@ pyramid @-@ shaped headquarters , and the uniquely designed <unk> TV Tower with an observation deck and rotating restaurant . In the early 21st century , new edifices have transformed the traditional cityscape . The construction boom has spawned new public buildings , such as the Most Apollo and a new building of the Slovak National Theatre , as well as private real @-@ estate development . 
 = = = Bratislava Castle = = = 
 One of the most prominent structures in the city is Bratislava Castle , situated on a plateau 85 metres ( 279 ft ) above the Danube . The castle hill site has been inhabited since the transitional period between the Stone and Bronze ages and has been the acropolis of a Celtic town , part of the Roman Limes Romanus , a huge Slavic fortified settlement , and a political , military and religious centre for Great Moravia . A stone castle was not constructed until the 10th century , when the area was part of the Kingdom of Hungary . The castle was converted into a Gothic anti @-@ Hussite fortress under Sigismund of Luxemburg in 1430 , became a Renaissance castle in 1562 , and was rebuilt in 1649 in the baroque style . Under Queen Maria Theresa , the castle became a prestigious royal seat . In 1811 , the castle was inadvertently destroyed by fire and lay in ruins until the 1950s , when it was rebuilt mostly in its former Theresian style . 
 = = = Devín Castle = = = 
 The ruined and recently renovated Devín Castle is in the borough of Devín , on top of a rock where the Morava River , which forms the border between Austria and Slovakia , enters the Danube . It is one of the most important Slovak archaeological sites and contains a museum dedicated to its history . Due to its strategic location , Devín Castle was a very important frontier castle of Great Moravia and the early Hungarian state . It was destroyed by Napoleon 's troops in 1809 . It is an important symbol of Slovak and Slavic history .

The borough is also known for the ruins of the Roman military camp <unk> , part of Limes Romanus , a border defence system . <unk> was built and used between the 1st and 4th centuries AD . 
 = = = Parks and lakes = = = 
 Due to its location in the foothills of the Little Carpathians and its riparian vegetation on the Danubian floodplains , Bratislava has forests close to the city centre . The total amount of public green space is 46 @.@ 8 square kilometres ( 18 @.@ 1 sq mi ) , or 110 square metres ( 1 @,@ 200 sq ft ) per inhabitant . The largest city park is <unk> park ( literally , Mountainous Park ) , in the Old Town . <unk> <unk> park ( Bratislava Forest Park ) is located in the Little Carpathians and includes many locales popular among visitors , such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> . The Forest Park covers an area of 27 @.@ 3 square kilometres ( 10 @.@ 5 sq mi ) , of which 96 % is forested mostly with oak and mixed oak / hornbeam forest , and contains original flora and fauna such as European badgers , red foxes , wild boar and red and roe deer . On the right bank of the Danube , in the borough of Petržalka , is Janko <unk> Park founded in 1774 – 76 . A new city park is planned for Petržalka between the <unk> <unk> and Veľký <unk> lakes . 
 Bratislava 's zoological park is located in <unk> <unk> , near the headquarters of Slovak Television . The zoo , founded in 1960 , currently houses 152 species of animals , including the rare white lion and white tiger . The Botanical Gardens , which belong to Comenius University , can be found on the Danube riverfront and house more than 120 species of domestic and foreign origin . 
 The city has a number of natural and man @-@ made lakes , most of which are used for recreation . Examples include <unk> lake in Ružinov , <unk> in Nové Mesto , <unk> <unk> and the <unk> lakes in the north @-@ east , and Rusovce lake in the south , which is popular with nudists . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 From the city 's origin until the 19th century , Germans were the dominant ethnic group . However , after the Austro @-@ Hungarian Compromise of 1867 , active Magyarisation took place , and by the end of World War I 40 % of the population of Pressburg spoke Hungarian as their native language , 42 % German , and 15 % Slovak . After the formation of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918 , Bratislava remained a multi @-@ ethnic city , but with a different demographic trend . Due to <unk> , the proportion of Slovaks and Czechs increased in the city , while the proportion of Germans and Hungarians fell . In 1938 , 59 % of population were Slovaks or Czechs , while Germans represented 22 % and Hungarians 13 % of the city 's population . The creation of the first Slovak Republic in 1939 brought other changes , most notably the expulsion of many Czechs and the deportation or flight of the Jews during the Holocaust . In 1945 , most of the Germans were evacuated . After the restoration of Czechoslovakia , the Beneš decrees ( partly revoked in 1948 ) collectively punished ethnic German and Hungarian minorities by expropriation and deportation to Germany , Austria , and Hungary for their alleged collaborationism with Nazi Germany and Hungary against Czechoslovakia . The city thereby obtained its clearly Slovak character . Hundreds of citizens were expelled during the communist oppression of the 1950s , with the aim of replacing " reactionary " people with the proletarian class . Since the 1950s , the Slovaks have been the dominant ethnicity in the town , making up around 90 % of the city 's population .

 Bratislava is the seat of the Slovak parliament , presidency , ministries , supreme court ( Slovak : <unk> <unk> ) , and central bank . It is the seat of the Bratislava Region and , since 2002 , also of the Bratislava Self @-@ Governing Region . The city also has many foreign embassies and consulates . 
 The current local government ( Mestská <unk> ) structure has been in place since 1990 . It is composed of a mayor ( <unk> ) , a city board ( Mestská rada ) , a city council ( <unk> <unk> ) , city commissions ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , and a city magistrate 's office ( <unk> ) . 
 The mayor , based at the Primate 's Palace , is the city 's top executive officer and is elected to a four @-@ year term of office . The current mayor of Bratislava is Ivo <unk> , who won the election held on November 15 , 2014 as an independent candidate . The city council is the city 's legislative body , responsible for issues such as budget , local ordinances , city planning , road maintenance , education , and culture . The Council usually convenes once a month and consists of 45 members elected to four @-@ year terms concurrent with the mayor 's . Many of the council 's executive functions are carried out by the city commission at the council 's direction . The city board is a 28 @-@ member body composed of the mayor and his deputies , the borough mayors , and up to ten city council members . The board is an executive and supervisory arm of the city council and also serves in an advisory role to the mayor . 
 Administratively , Bratislava is divided into five districts : Bratislava I ( the city centre ) , Bratislava II ( eastern parts ) , Bratislava III ( north @-@ eastern parts ) , Bratislava IV ( western and northern parts ) and Bratislava V ( southern parts on the right bank of the Danube , including Petržalka , the most densely populated residential area in Central Europe ) . 
 For self @-@ governance purposes , the city is divided into 17 boroughs , each of which has its own mayor ( starosta ) and council . The number of councillors in each depends on the size and population of the borough . Each of the boroughs coincides with the city 's 20 cadastral areas , except for two cases : Nové Mesto is further divided into the Nové Mesto and Vinohrady cadastral areas and Ružinov is divided into Ružinov , Nivy and <unk> . Further unofficial division recognizes additional quarters and localities .

 The Slovak economy 's strong growth in the 2000s has led to a boom in the construction industry , and several major projects have been completed or are planned in Bratislava . Areas attracting developers include the Danube riverfront , where two major projects are already finished : River Park in the Old Town , and <unk> near the Apollo Bridge . Other locations under development include the areas around the main railway and bus stations , around the former industrial zone near the Old Town and in the boroughs of Petržalka , Nové Mesto and Ružinov . It is expected that investors will spend € 1 @.@ 2 billion on new projects by 2010 . The city has a balanced budget of 277 million Euros ( as of 2010 ) , with one fifth used for investment .

 The 29th Boat Race took place on the 27 March 1872 . The Boat Race is an annual side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . In a race umpired by Robert Lewis @-@ Lloyd , Cambridge won by two lengths in a time of 21 minutes 15 seconds taking the overall record to 16 – 13 in Oxford 's favour . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having defeated Oxford by one length in the previous year 's race , while Oxford led overall with sixteen wins to Cambridge 's twelve . 
 During the build @-@ up to the race , Oxford 's boat club president , Robert Lesley of Pembroke College , strained his side and was prohibited from practice . Worse still , four days before the race , the number two rower Armistead " broke down and was replaced by C. C. Knollys , also an untrained man " . Conversely , Cambridge saw John Goldie return as president for the third consecutive year , and while all the previous year 's Blues were available , four were selected for the race . 
 Oxford were coached by E. G. Banks of Worcester College and Frank Willan who had rowed for the Dark Blues four times between the 1866 and 1869 races . Cambridge 's coaches were John Graham Chambers ( who rowed for Cambridge in the 1862 and 1863 races , and was non @-@ rowing boat club president for the 1865 race ) and William Henry Lowe ( who rowed in three times , in the 1868 , 1870 and 1871 races ) . 
 While sliding seats had started to come to prominence , having been first used by a crew from Pembroke College , Goldie was reluctant to allow them to be tried for the race and disallowed the Light Blue boat manufacturer Harry Clasper from fitting them . The umpire for the race was Robert Lewis @-@ Lloyd , the first time since The Boat Race 1856 that the event was not overseen by Joseph William Chitty . Lewis @-@ Lloyd had rowed for Cambridge four times , between the 1856 and the 1859 races inclusively . Edward Searle once again performed the duties of the starter . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 11 st 12 @.@ 875 lb ( 75 @.@ 6 kg ) , 2 @.@ 375 pounds ( 1 @.@ 1 kg ) more than their opponents . Oxford 's crew contained three rowers with Boat Race experience , and saw F. H. Hall return to cox the Dark Blue boat for the third time . Along with stroke and president Goldie , Cambridge 's crew included Edmund Spencer and Edward Randolph ( each rowing their third race ) , and John Brooks Close who had rowed in 1871 . 
 = = Race = = 
 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station , handing the Surrey side of the river to Oxford . The race started at <unk> " in the teeth of a bitter north @-@ easterly gale and snow @-@ storm " , and proved uneventful with the Light Blues winning by two lengths in a time of 21 minutes 15 seconds . Partway through the race , Goldie had broken a bolt in his rigging ; although he could no longer contribute to the power of the Light Blue boat , he continued to stroke and provide the required rhythm to lead Cambridge to the victory . It was Cambridge 's third consecutive win and took the overall record to 16 – 13 in Oxford 's favour . 
 = Magdeburg @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Magdeburg class of light cruisers was a group of four ships built for the German Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) . The class comprised SMS Magdeburg , the lead ship , Breslau , Strassburg , and Stralsund . All four ships were laid down in 1910 and were completed by the end of 1912 . They were armed with a main battery of twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm guns , though over the course of their careers , Breslau , Strassburg , and Stralsund were rearmed with more powerful 15 cm guns . They displaced 4 @,@ 570 t ( 4 @,@ 500 long tons ) at full load and were rated at a top speed of 27 @.@ 5 knots ( 50 @.@ 9 km / h ; 31 @.@ 6 mph ) , though all four vessels exceeded that figure on trials . 
 Magdeburg was used as a torpedo test ship before the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , after which she was assigned to the Baltic . She conducted a series of raids on Russian positions culminating in a sweep into the Gulf of Finland that resulted in her grounding off the Estonian coast . Russian cruisers seized the stranded ship and captured code books ; they gave one copy to the British Royal Navy , which used it to great advantage . Breslau was assigned to the Mittelmeerdivision with the battlecruiser Goeben in 1912 and remained in the Mediterranean until the outbreak of war . After evading British warships , the two vessels reached Constantinople , where they were transferred to the Ottoman Navy . She operated primarily in the Black Sea against the Russian Navy , but in January 1918 she ventured into the Mediterranean and was mined and sunk after the Battle of Imbros . 
 Strassburg and Stralsund served with the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea against the British . They saw action at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914 and served in the reconnaissance screen for the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group on several bombardments of the British coast in 1914 – 1915 . Stralsund was also present at the Battle of Dogger Bank , but was not heavily engaged . Strassburg saw action during Operation Albion against the Russians in the Baltic . Both ships were surrendered to the Allies after the end of the war ; Strassburg was ceded to Italy and renamed Taranto ; she served with the Italian Navy until 1943 , when she was scuttled after the Italian surrender . She was raised by the Germans and sunk by Allied bombers twice in 1943 – 1944 , and finally scrapped in 1946 – 1947 . Stralsund was given to France and renamed Mulhouse . She served only until 1925 , when she was placed in reserve . She was ultimately broken up in 1935 . 
 = = Design = = 
 The design for the ships of the Magdeburg class was prepared in 1908 – 1909 . The design incorporated a number of innovations , including a new longitudinal frame system in the hull , the development of which delayed construction by three to four years . The hull form was also redesigned to improve efficiency , and a new clipper bow was used instead of the old cruiser ram bow . They were the first German light cruisers to incorporate an armored belt at the waterline ; this increased the strength of the hull and became standard practice in warship construction for decades . The quarterdeck was cut down to provide a location to drop mines . All of these features became standard for subsequent German cruiser designs . 
 = = = General characteristics and machinery = = = 
 The ships of the Magdeburg class were 136 meters ( 446 ft ) long at the waterline and 138 @.@ 7 m ( 455 ft ) long overall . They had a beam of 13 @.@ 5 m ( 44 ft ) and a draft of 4 @.@ 4 m ( 14 ft ) forward and 5 @.@ 16 m ( 16 @.@ 9 ft ) aft . They displaced 4 @,@ 535 metric tons ( 4 @,@ 463 long tons ; 4 @,@ 999 short tons ) 4 @,@ 570 t ( 4 @,@ 500 long tons ; 5 @,@ 040 short tons ) at full combat load . The hulls were built with longitudinal steel frames and contained fourteen watertight compartments in Magdeburg , Strassburg , and Stralsund . Breslau 's hull was divided into sixteen watertight compartments . All four vessels had a double bottom that extended for forty @-@ five percent of the length of the hull . 
 The four vessels each had a crew of 18 officers and 336 enlisted men . They carried a number of smaller boats , including one picket boat , one barge , one cutter , two yawls , and two dinghies . The German Navy regarded the ships as good sea boats , with slight weather helm and gentle motion in a swell . The cruisers were maneuverable , but were slow going into a turn . Steering was controlled by a single large rudder . They lost speed only slightly in a head sea , but lost up to sixty percent in hard turns . They had a transverse metacentric height of .79 m ( 2 ft 7 in ) . 
 Their propulsion systems consisted of steam turbines of various types . Each ship had turbines built by different manufacturers to evaluate each design and configuration . Magdeburg had three engines produced by Bergmann , which drove three 2 @.@ 75 @-@ meter ( 9 ft 0 in ) propellers . Breslau was equipped with two pairs of AG Vulcan turbines , which powered four 3 @-@ bladed screws 2 @.@ 47 m ( 8 ft 1 in ) in diameter . Strassburg had a pair of Marine @-@ type turbines with two 3 @.@ 4 m ( 11 ft ) wide propellers . Stralsund initially had three Bergmann turbines with three 2 @.@ 75 m screws , though by the end of the war the center shaft was removed . All four propulsion systems were rated at 25 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 19 @,@ 000 kW ) , but reached significantly higher speeds in service . 
 The ships ' turbines were powered by sixteen coal @-@ fired Marine @-@ type water @-@ tube boilers , although they were later altered to use fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate . These were divided into five boiler rooms on the centerline . These gave the ships a top speed of 27 @.@ 5 knots ( 50 @.@ 9 km / h ; 31 @.@ 6 mph ) , though on speed trials all four ships exceeded this by at least half a knot . The ships carried 1 @,@ 200 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 200 long tons ) of coal , and an additional 106 tonnes ( 104 long tons ) of oil that gave them a range of approximately 5 @,@ 820 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 780 km ; 6 @,@ 700 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . At 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) , the range fell considerably to 900 nmi ( 1 @,@ 700 km ; 1 @,@ 000 mi ) . Magdeburg , Strassburg , and Stralsund each had four turbo generators with a combined output of 320 kilowatts ( 430 hp ) at 220 Volts ; Breslau only had two generators . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 The four Magdeburg @-@ class ships were armed with twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 guns in single pedestal mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , eight were located amidships , four on either side , and two were side by side aft . The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees , which allowed them to engage targets out to 12 @,@ 700 m ( 41 @,@ 700 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 800 rounds of ammunition , for 150 shells per gun . They were also equipped with a pair of 50 cm ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes submerged in the hull on the broadside . The ships could also carry 120 mines . 
 Over the course of their careers , the ships all had their armament upgraded , with the exception of Magdeburg . In 1916 , two of Breslau 's 10 @.@ 5 cm guns were replaced with 15 cm SK L / 45 guns , which had a range of 17 @,@ 600 m ( 57 @,@ 700 ft ) . The following year , the remaining ten 10 @.@ 5 cm guns were replaced with six 15 cm guns . In 1915 , Strassburg was rearmed with seven 15 cm guns , two 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 46 in ) SK L / 45 guns , and two deck @-@ mounted 50 cm torpedo tubes . Stralsund was modified similarly , though her submerged torpedo tubes were removed during the refit . 
 The ships were protected by a waterline armored belt that was 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick amidships and 18 mm ( 0 @.@ 71 in ) thick on the bow . The stern was unarmored . The deck was covered with up to 60 mm thick armor plate forward , 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick amidships , and 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) thick aft . Sloped armor 40 mm thick connected the deck and belt armor . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides and a 20 mm thick roof .

 Magdeburg was used as a torpedo test ship after her commissioning until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , when she was brought to active service and deployed to the Baltic . In the Baltic , Magdeburg fired the first shots of the war against the Russians on 2 August , when she shelled the port of Libau . She participated in a series of bombardments of Russian positions until late August . On the 26th , she participated in a sweep of the entrance to the Gulf of Finland ; while steaming off the Estonian coast , she ran aground off the island of Odensholm and could not be freed . A pair of Russian cruisers appeared and seized the ship . Fifteen crew members were killed in the brief engagement . They recovered three intact German code books , one of which they passed to the British . The ability to decrypt German wireless signals provided the British with the ability to ambush German units on several occasions during the war , including the Battle of Jutland . The Russians partially scrapped Magdeburg while she remained grounded before completely destroying the wreck . 
 = = = Breslau = = = 
 Following her commissioning , Breslau and the battlecruiser Goeben were assigned to the Mittelmeerdivision in response to the Balkan Wars . After evading British warships in the Mediterranean to reach Constantinople , Breslau and Goeben were transferred to the Ottoman Empire in August 1914 , to entice the Ottomans to join the Central Powers in World War I. The ships were renamed Midilli and Yavuz Sultan Selim , respectively , and saw extensive service with the Ottoman fleet , primarily in the Black Sea against the Russian Black Sea Fleet . The two ships , along with several other Ottoman vessels , raided Russian ports in October 1914 , prompting a Russian declaration of war . 
 Midilli was active in laying minefields off the Russian coast , bombarding Russian ports and installations and , because of a shortage of Ottoman merchant ships , transporting troops and supplies to the Black Sea ports supplying Ottoman troops fighting in the Caucasus Campaign . She was lightly damaged several times by Russian ships , but the most serious damage was inflicted by a mine in 1915 , which kept her out of service for half of a year . The ship was mined and sunk in January 1918 during the Battle of Imbros in which Yavuz Sultan Selim was also mined and badly damaged . The majority of her crew were killed in the sinking . 
 = = = Strassburg = = = 
 Strassburg spent the first year of her service overseas , after which she was assigned to the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet . She saw significant action at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914 and participated in the raid on Scarborough , Hartlepool and Whitby in December 1914 . By 1916 , the ship was transferred to the Baltic to operate against the Russian Navy . She saw action during Operation Albion in the Gulf of Riga in October 1917 , including screening for the battleships König and Markgraf during the Battle of Moon Sound . She returned to the North Sea for the planned final operation against the British Grand Fleet in the last weeks of the war , and was involved in the mutinies that forced the cancellation of the operation . 
 The ship served briefly in the new Reichsmarine in 1919 before being transferred to Italy as a war prize . She was formally transferred in July 1920 and renamed Taranto for service in the Italian Navy . In 1936 – 1937 , she was rebuilt for colonial duties and additional anti @-@ aircraft guns were installed . She saw no significant action during World War II until the Armistice that ended Italy 's participation in the war . She was scuttled by the Italian Navy , captured and raised by the Germans , and sunk by Allied bombers in October 1943 . The Germans raised the ship again , which was sunk a second time by bombers in September 1944 . Taranto was finally broken up for scrap in 1946 – 1947 .

 Stralsund was assigned to the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet for the majority of her career . She saw significant action in the early years of World War I , including several operations off the British coast and the Battles of Heligoland Bight and Dogger Bank , in August 1914 and November 1915 , respectively . She was not damaged in either action . The ship was in dockyard hands during the Battle of Jutland , and so she missed the engagement . After the end of the war , she served briefly in the Reichsmarine before being surrendered to the Allies . She was ceded to the French Navy , where she served as Mulhouse until 1925 . She was formally stricken in 1933 and broken up for scrap two years later .

 = Czech language = 
 Czech ( / <unk> / ; <unk> Czech pronunciation : [ ˈt ͡ <unk> ] ) , formerly known as Bohemian ( / <unk> , <unk> / ; lingua <unk> in Latin ) , is a West Slavic language strongly influenced by Latin and German . It is spoken by over 10 million people and is the official language of the Czech Republic . Czech 's closest relative is Slovak , with which it is mutually intelligible . It is closely related to other West Slavic languages , such as Silesian and Polish . Although most Czech vocabulary is based on shared roots with Slavic , Romance , and Germanic languages , many loanwords ( most associated with high culture ) have been adopted in recent years . 
 The language began in its present linguistic branch as Old Czech before slowly dwindling in importance , dominated by German in the Czech lands . During the mid @-@ eighteenth century , it experienced a revival in which Czech academics stressed the past accomplishments of their people and advocated the return of Czech as a major language . It has changed little since that time , except for minor morphological shifts and the formalization of colloquial elements . 
 Its phoneme inventory is moderate in size , comprising five vowels ( each short or long ) and twenty @-@ five consonants ( divided into " hard " , " neutral " and " soft " categories ) . Words may contain uncommon ( or complicated ) consonant clusters , including one consonant represented by the grapheme ř , or lack vowels altogether . Czech orthography is simple , and has been used as a model by phonologists . 
 As a member of the Slavic sub @-@ family of the Indo @-@ European languages , Czech is a highly inflected fusional language . Its nouns and adjectives undergo a complex system of declension for case , number , gender , animacy , and type of ending consonant ( hard , neutral or soft ) . Verbs ( with aspect ) are conjugated somewhat more simply for tense , number and gender . Because of this inflection , Czech word order is very flexible and words may be transposed to change emphasis or form questions . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Czech is classified as a member of the West Slavic sub @-@ branch of the Slavic branch of the Indo @-@ European language family . This branch includes Polish , Kashubian , Upper and Lower Sorbian and Slovak . Slovak is by far the closest genetic neighbor of Czech , and the languages are closer than any other pair of West Slavic languages ( including Upper and Lower Sorbian , which share a name by association with an ethnic group ) . 
 The West Slavic languages are spoken in an area classified as part of Central Europe . Except for Polish they differ from East and South Slavic languages by their initial @-@ syllable stress , and Czech is distinguished from other West Slavic languages by a more @-@ restricted distinction between " hard " and " soft " consonants ( see Phonology below ) . 
 = = = Mutual intelligibility = = = 
 Czech and Slovak have been considered mutually intelligible ; speakers of either language can communicate with greater ease than those of any other pair of West Slavic languages . Since the 1993 dissolution of Czechoslovakia mutual intelligibility has declined for younger speakers , probably because Czech speakers now experience less exposure to Slovak and vice versa . 
 The languages have not undergone the deliberate highlighting of minor linguistic differences in the name of nationalism as has occurred in the Bosnian , Serbian and Croatian standards of Serbo @-@ Croatian . However , most Slavic languages ( including Czech ) have been distanced in this way from Russian influences because of widespread public resentment against the former Soviet Union ( which occupied Czechoslovakia in 1968 ) . Czech and Slovak form a dialect continuum , with great similarity between neighboring Czech and Slovak dialects . ( See " Dialects " below . ) 
 In phonetic differences , Czech is characterized by a glottal stop before initial vowels and Slovak by its less @-@ frequent use of long vowels than Czech ; however , Slovak has long forms of the consonants r and l when they function as vowels . <unk> differences between the two languages are generally consistent , typical of two dialects of a language . <unk> , although Czech ( unlike Slovak ) has a vocative case both languages share a common syntax . 
 One study showed that Czech and Slovak lexicons differed by 80 percent , but this high percentage was found to stem primarily from differing orthographies and slight inconsistencies in morphological formation ; Slovak morphology is more regular ( when changing from the nominative to the locative case , Praha becomes <unk> in Czech and <unk> in Slovak ) . The two lexicons are generally considered similar , with most differences found in colloquial vocabulary and some scientific terminology . Slovak has slightly more borrowed words than Czech . 
 The similarities between Czech and Slovak led to the languages being considered a single language by a group of 19th @-@ century scholars who called themselves " <unk> " ( <unk> ) , believing that the peoples were connected in a way which excluded German Bohemians and ( to a lesser extent ) Hungarians and other Slavs . During the First Czechoslovak Republic ( 1918 – 1938 ) , although " Czechoslovak " was designated as the republic 's official language both Czech and Slovak written standards were used . Standard written Slovak was partially modeled on literary Czech , and Czech was preferred for some official functions in the Slovak half of the republic . Czech influence on Slovak was protested by Slovak scholars , and when Slovakia broke off from Czechoslovakia in 1938 as the Slovak State ( which then aligned with Nazi Germany in World War II ) literary Slovak was deliberately distanced from Czech . When the Axis powers lost the war and Czechoslovakia reformed , Slovak developed somewhat on its own ( with Czech influence ) ; during the Prague Spring of 1968 , Slovak gained independence from ( and equality with ) Czech . Since then , " Czechoslovak " refers to improvised pidgins of the languages which have arisen from the decrease in mutual intelligibility . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins : Proto @-@ Czech and Old Czech = = = 
 Around the sixth century AD , a tribe of Slavs arrived in a portion of Central Europe . According to legend they were led by a hero named Čech , from whom the word " Czech " derives . The ninth century brought the state of Great Moravia , whose first ruler ( Rastislav of Moravia ) invited Byzantine ruler Michael III to send missionaries in an attempt to reduce the influence of East Francia on religious and political life in his country . These missionaries , Constantine and Methodius , helped to convert the Czechs from traditional Slavic paganism to Christianity and established a church system . They also brought the Glagolitic alphabet to the West Slavs , whose language was previously unwritten . This language , later known as Proto @-@ Czech , was beginning to separate from its fellow West Slavic hatchlings Proto @-@ Slovak , Proto @-@ Polish and Proto @-@ Sorbian . Among other features , Proto @-@ Czech was marked by its ephemeral use of the voiced velar fricative consonant ( / ɣ / ) and consistent stress on the first syllable . 
 The Czechs ' language separated from other Slavic tongues into what would later be called Old Czech by the thirteenth century , a classification extending through the sixteenth century . Its use of cases differed from the modern language ; although Old Czech did not yet have a vocative case or an animacy distinction , declension for its six cases and three genders rapidly became complicated ( partially to differentiate homophones ) and its declension patterns resembled those of Lithuanian ( its Balto @-@ Slavic cousin ) . 
 While Old Czech had a basic alphabet from which a general set of orthographical correspondences was drawn , it did not have a standard orthography . It also contained a number of sound clusters which no longer exist ; allowing ě ( / <unk> / ) after soft consonants , which has since shifted to e ( / ɛ / ) , and allowing complex consonant clusters to be pronounced all at once rather than syllabically . A phonological phenomenon , <unk> 's law ( which began in Proto @-@ Slavic and took various forms in other Slavic languages ) , appeared in Old Czech ; counting backwards from the end of a clause , every odd @-@ numbered yer was vocalized as a vowel , while the other <unk> disappeared . 
 Bohemia ( as Czech civilization was known by then ) increased in power over the centuries , as its language did in regional importance . This growth was expedited during the fourteenth century by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV , who founded Charles University in Prague in 1348 . Here , early Czech literature ( a biblical translation , hymns and hagiography ) flourished . Old Czech texts , including poetry and cookbooks , were produced outside the university as well . Later in the century Jan Hus contributed significantly to the standardization of Czech orthography , advocated for widespread literacy among Czech commoners ( particularly in religion ) and made early efforts to model written Czech after the spoken language . 
 Czech continued to evolve and gain in regional importance for hundreds of years , and has been a literary language in the Slovak lands since the early fifteenth century . A biblical translation , the <unk> Bible , was published during the late sixteenth century ( around the time of the King James and Luther versions ) which was more linguistically conservative than either . The publication of the <unk> Bible spawned widespread nationalism , and in 1615 the government of Bohemia ruled that only Czech @-@ speaking residents would be allowed to become full citizens or inherit goods or land . This , and the conversion of the Czech upper classes from the Habsburg Empire 's Catholicism to Protestantism , angered the Habsburgs and helped trigger the Thirty Years ' War ( where the Czechs were defeated at the Battle of White Mountain ) . The Czechs became serfs ; Bohemia 's printing industry ( and its linguistic and political rights ) were dismembered , removing official regulation and support from its language . German quickly became the dominant language in Bohemia . 
 = = = Revival : Modern Czech = = = 
 The consensus among linguists is that modern , standard Czech originated during the eighteenth century . By then the language had developed a literary tradition , and since then it has changed little ; journals from that period have no substantial differences from modern standard Czech , and contemporary Czechs can understand them with little difficulty . Changes include the morphological shift of í to ej and é to í ( although é survives for some uses ) and the merging of í and the former <unk> . Sometime before the eighteenth century , the Czech language abandoned a distinction between phonemic / l / and / ʎ / which survives in Slovak . 
 The Czech people gained widespread national pride during the mid @-@ eighteenth century , inspired by the Age of Enlightenment a half @-@ century earlier . Czech historians began to emphasize their people 's accomplishments from the fifteenth through the seventeenth centuries , rebelling against the Counter @-@ Reformation ( which had denigrated Czech and other non @-@ Latin languages ) . Czech philologists studied sixteenth @-@ century texts , advocating the return of the language to high culture . This period is known as the Czech National Revival ( or <unk> ) . 
 During the revival , in 1809 linguist and historian Josef Dobrovský released a German @-@ language grammar of Old Czech entitled <unk> <unk> der <unk> <unk> ( Comprehensive Doctrine of the Bohemian Language ) . Dobrovský had intended his book to be descriptive , and did not think Czech had a realistic chance of returning as a major language . However , Josef Jungmann and other revivalists used Dobrovský 's book to advocate for a Czech linguistic revival . Changes during this time included spelling reform ( notably , í in place of the former j and j in place of g ) , the use of t ( rather than ti ) to end infinitive verbs and the non @-@ capitalization of nouns ( which had been a late borrowing from German ) . These changes differentiated Czech from Slovak . Modern scholars disagree about whether the conservative revivalists were motivated by nationalism or considered contemporary spoken Czech unsuitable for formal , widespread use . 
 Adherence to historical patterns was later relaxed and standard Czech adopted a number of features from Common Czech ( a widespread , informal register ) , such as leaving some proper nouns <unk> . This has resulted in a relatively high level of homogeneity among all varieties of the language . 
 = = Geographic distribution = = 
 In 2005 and 2007 , Czech was spoken by about 10 million residents of the Czech Republic . A Eurobarometer survey conducted from January to March 2012 found that the first language of 98 percent of Czech citizens was Czech , the third @-@ highest in the European Union ( behind Greece and Hungary ) . 
 Czech , the official language of the Czech Republic ( a member of the European Union since 2004 ) , is one of the EU 's official languages and the 2012 Eurobarometer survey found that Czech was the foreign language most often used in Slovakia . Economist Jonathan van Parys collected data on language knowledge in Europe for the 2012 European Day of Languages . The five countries with the greatest use of Czech were the Czech Republic ( 98 @.@ 77 percent ) , Slovakia ( 24 @.@ 86 percent ) , Portugal ( 1 @.@ 93 percent ) , Poland ( 0 @.@ 98 percent ) and Germany ( 0 @.@ 47 percent ) . 
 Czech speakers in Slovakia primarily live in cities . Since it is a recognised minority language in Slovakia , Slovak citizens who speak only Czech may communicate with the government in their language to the extent that Slovak speakers in the Czech Republic may do so . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 Immigration of Czechs from Europe to the United States occurred primarily from 1848 to 1914 . Czech is a Less Commonly Taught Language in U.S. schools , and is taught at Czech heritage centers . Large communities of Czech Americans live in the states of Texas , Nebraska and Wisconsin . In the 2000 United States Census , Czech was reported as the most @-@ common language spoken at home ( besides English ) in Valley , Butler and Saunders Counties , Nebraska and Republic County , Kansas . With the exception of Spanish ( the non @-@ English language most commonly spoken at home nationwide ) , Czech was the most @-@ common home language in over a dozen additional counties in Nebraska , Kansas , Texas , North Dakota and Minnesota . As of 2009 , 70 @,@ 500 Americans spoke Czech as their first language ( 49th place nationwide , behind Turkish and ahead of Swedish ) . 
 = = Dialects = = 
 In addition to a spoken standard and a closely related written standard , Czech has several regional dialects primarily used in rural areas by speakers less proficient in other dialects or standard Czech . During the second half of the twentieth century , Czech dialect use began to weaken . By the early 1990s dialect use was stigmatized , associated with the shrinking lower class and used in literature or other media for comedic effect . Increased travel and media availability to dialect @-@ speaking populations has encouraged them to shift to ( or add to their own dialect ) standard Czech . Although Czech has received considerable scholarly interest for a Slavic language , this interest has focused primarily on modern standard Czech and ancient texts rather than dialects . Standard Czech is still the norm for politicians , businesspeople and other Czechs in formal situations , but Common Czech is gaining ground in journalism and the mass media . 
 A detailed 2003 estimate from the Czech Statistical Office counts the following dialects : 
 Nářečí <unk> ( Central Bohemian dialects ) 
 Nářečí <unk> ( Southwestern Bohemian dialects ) 
 Podskupina <unk> ( <unk> subgroup ) 
 Podskupina <unk> ( <unk> subgroup ) 
 Nářečí <unk> ( Bohemian – Moravian dialects ) 
 Nářečí <unk> ( Central Moravian dialects ) 
 Podskupina <unk> ( <unk> subgroup ) 
 Nářečí <unk> ( Eastern Moravian dialects ) 
 Podskupina <unk> ( Moravian Slovak subgroup ) 
 Podskupina <unk> ( Moravian Wallachian subgroup ) 
 Nářečí <unk> ( Silesian dialects ) 
 Nářečí <unk> ( Northeastern Bohemian dialects ) 
 Podskupina <unk> ( Krkonoše subgroup ) 
 The main colloquial Czech dialect , spoken primarily near Prague but also throughout the country , is known as Common Czech ( <unk> <unk> ) . This is an academic distinction ; most Czechs are unaware of the term or associate it with vernacular ( or incorrect ) Czech . Compared to standard Czech , Common Czech is characterized by simpler inflection patterns and differences in sound distribution . 
 The Czech dialects spoken in Moravia and Silesia are known as Moravian ( <unk> ) . In the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire , " Bohemian @-@ Moravian @-@ Slovak " was a language citizens could register as speaking ( with German , Polish and several others ) . Of the Czech dialects , only Moravian is distinguished in nationwide surveys by the Czech Statistical Office . As of 2011 , 62 @,@ 908 Czech citizens spoke Moravian as their first language and 45 @,@ 561 were <unk> ( speaking Moravian and standard Czech as first languages ) . 
 Beginning in the sixteenth century , some varieties of Czech resembled Slovak ; the southeastern Moravian dialects , in particular , are sometimes considered dialects of Slovak rather than Czech . These dialects form a continuum between the Czech and Slovak languages , using the same declension patterns for nouns and pronouns and the same verb conjugations as Slovak . 
 In a 1964 textbook on Czech dialectology , <unk> <unk> used the following sentence to highlight phonetic differences between dialects : 
 = = Phonology = = 
 Czech contains ten basic vowel phonemes , and three more found only in loanwords . They are / a / , / ɛ / , / ɪ / , / o / , and / u / , their long counterparts / aː / , / ɛː / , / iː / , / oː / and / uː / , and three diphthongs , / ou ̯ / , / au ̯ / and / <unk> ̯ / . The latter two diphthongs and the long / oː / are exclusive to loanwords . Vowels are never reduced to schwa sounds when unstressed . Each word usually has primary stress on its first syllable , except for <unk> ( minor , monosyllabic , unstressed syllables ) . In all words of more than two syllables , every odd @-@ numbered syllable receives secondary stress . Stress is unrelated to vowel length , and the possibility of stressed short vowels and unstressed long vowels can be confusing to students whose native language combines the features ( such as English ) . 
 Voiced consonants with unvoiced counterparts are unvoiced at the end of a word , or when they are followed by unvoiced consonants . Czech consonants are categorized as " hard " , " neutral " or " soft " : 
 Hard : / d / , / ɡ / , / ɦ / , / k / , / n / , / r / , / t / , / x / 
 Neutral : / b / , / f / , / l / , / m / , / p / , / s / , / v / , / z / 
 Soft : / c / , / ɟ / , / j / , / ɲ / , / r ̝ / , / ʃ / , / ts / , / tʃ / , / ʒ / 
 This distinction describes the declension patterns of nouns , which is based on the category of a noun 's ending consonant . Hard consonants may not be followed by i or í in writing , or soft ones by y or <unk> ( except in loanwords such as kilogram ) . Neutral consonants may take either character . Hard consonants are sometimes known as " strong " , and soft ones as " weak " . 
 The phoneme represented by the letter ř ( capital <unk> ) is considered unique to Czech . It represents the raised alveolar non @-@ sonorant trill ( IPA : [ r ̝ ] ) , a sound somewhere between Czech 's r and ž ( example : " <unk> " ( river ) ) , and is present in Dvořák . 
 The consonants / r / and / l / can be syllabic , acting as syllable nuclei in place of a vowel . This can be difficult for non @-@ native speakers to pronounce , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " Stick [ your ] finger down [ your ] throat " ) is a Czech tongue twister . 
 = = Vocabulary = = 
 Czech vocabulary derives primarily from Slavic , Baltic and other Indo @-@ European roots . Although most verbs have Balto @-@ Slavic origins , pronouns , prepositions and some verbs have wider , Indo @-@ European roots . Some loanwords have been restructured by folk etymology to resemble native Czech words ( <unk> , " graveyard " and <unk> , " list " ) . 
 Most Czech loanwords originated in one of two time periods . Earlier loanwords , primarily from German , Greek and Latin , arrived before the Czech National Revival . More recent loanwords derive primarily from English and French , and also from Hebrew , Arabic and Persian . Many Russian loanwords , principally animal names and naval terms , also exist in Czech . 
 Although older German loanwords were colloquial , recent borrowings from other languages are associated with high culture . During the nineteenth century , words with Greek and Latin roots were rejected in favor of those based on older Czech words and common Slavic roots ; " music " is <unk> in Polish and <unk> ( <unk> ) in Russian , but in Czech it is <unk> . Some Czech words have been borrowed as loanwords into English and other languages — for example , robot ( from <unk> , " labor " ) and polka ( from polka , " Polish woman " or from " <unk> " " half " ) . 
 = = Grammar = = 
 Typical of Indo @-@ European languages , Czech grammar is fusional ; its nouns , verbs , and adjectives are inflected by phonological processes to modify their meanings and grammatical functions , and the easily separable affixes characteristic of agglutinative languages are limited . Slavic @-@ language inflection is complex and pervasive , inflecting for case , gender and number in nouns and tense , aspect , mood , person and subject number and gender in verbs . 
 Other parts of speech include adjectives , adverbs , numbers , interrogative words , prepositions , conjunctions and interjections . Adverbs are primarily formed by taking the final <unk> or í of an adjective and replacing it with e , ě , or o . Negative statements are formed by adding the affix <unk> to the verb of a clause , with one exception : je ( he , she or it is ) becomes <unk> . 
 = = = Sentence and clause structure = = = 
 Because Czech uses grammatical case to convey word function in a sentence ( instead of relying on word order , as English does ) , its word order is flexible . As a pro @-@ drop language , in Czech an intransitive sentence can consist of only a verb ; information about its subject is encoded in the verb . <unk> ( primarily auxiliary verbs and pronouns ) must appear in the second syntactic slot of a sentence , after the first stressed unit . The first slot must contain a subject and object , a main form of a verb , an adverb or a conjunction ( except for the light conjunctions a , " and " , i , " and even " or ale , " but " ) . 
 Czech syntax has a subject – verb – object sentence structure . In practice , however , word order is flexible and used for <unk> and focus . Although Czech has a periphrastic passive construction ( like English ) , colloquial word @-@ order changes frequently produce the passive voice . For example , to change " Peter killed Paul " to " Paul was killed by Peter " the order of subject and object is inverted : Petr <unk> Pavla ( " Peter killed Paul " ) becomes " Paul , Peter killed " ( Pavla <unk> Petr ) . Pavla is in the accusative case , the grammatical object ( in this case , the victim ) of the verb . 
 A word at the end of a clause is typically emphasized , unless an upward intonation indicates that the sentence is a question : 
 <unk> jí bagetu . – The dog eats the baguette ( rather than eating something else ) . 
 <unk> jí pes . – The dog eats the baguette ( rather than someone else doing so ) . 
 <unk> bagetu jí . – The dog eats the baguette ( rather than doing something else to it ) . 
 <unk> pes bagetu ? – Does the dog eat the baguette ? ( emphasis ambiguous ) 
 In portions of Bohemia ( including Prague ) , questions such as <unk> pes bagetu ? without an interrogative word ( such as co , " what " or <unk> , " who " ) are intoned in a slow rise from low to high , quickly dropping to low on the last word or phrase . 
 In Czech syntax , adjectives precede nouns . Relative clauses are introduced by <unk> such as the adjective <unk> , analogous to the English relative pronouns " which " , " that " , " who " and " whom " . As with other adjectives , it is declined into the appropriate case ( see <unk> below ) to match its associated noun , person and number . Relative clauses follow the noun they modify , and the following is a glossed example : 
 English : I want to visit the university that John attends . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 In Czech , nouns and adjectives are declined into one of seven grammatical cases . Nouns are inflected to indicate their use in a sentence . A nominative – accusative language , Czech marks subject nouns with nominative case and object nouns with accusative case . The genitive case marks possessive nouns and some types of movement . The remaining cases ( instrumental , locative , vocative and dative ) indicate semantic relationships , such as secondary objects , movement or position ( dative case ) and accompaniment ( instrumental case ) . An adjective 's case agrees with that of the noun it describes . When Czech children learn their language 's declension patterns , the cases are referred to by number : 
 Some Czech grammatical texts order the cases differently , grouping the nominative and accusative ( and the dative and locative ) together because those declension patterns are often identical ; this order accommodates learners with experience in other inflected languages , such as Latin or Russian . This order is nominative , accusative , genitive , dative , locative , instrumental and vocative . 
 Some prepositions require the nouns they modify to take a particular case . The cases assigned by each preposition are based on the physical ( or metaphorical ) direction , or location , conveyed by it . For example , od ( from , away from ) and z ( out of , off ) assign the genitive case . Other prepositions take one of several cases , with their meaning dependent on the case ; na means " onto " or " for " with the accusative case , but " on " with the locative . 
 Examples of declension patterns ( using prepositions ) for a few nouns with adjectives follow . Only one plural example is given , since plural declension patterns are similar across genders . 
 This is a glossed example of a sentence using several cases : 
 English : I carried the box into the house with my friend . 
 = = = = Gender and animacy = = = = 
 Czech distinguishes three genders — masculine , feminine , and neuter — and the masculine gender is subdivided into animate and inanimate . With few exceptions , feminine nouns in the nominative case end in -a , -e , or <unk> ; neuter nouns in -o , -e , or <unk> , and masculine nouns in a consonant . Adjectives agree in gender and animacy ( for masculine nouns in the accusative or genitive singular and the nominative plural ) with the nouns they modify . The main effect of gender in Czech is the difference in noun and adjective declension , but other effects include past @-@ tense verb endings : for example , <unk> ( he did , or made ) ; <unk> ( she did , or made ) and <unk> ( it did , or made ) . 
 = = = = Number = = = = 
 Nouns are also inflected for number , distinguishing between singular and plural . Typical of a Slavic language , Czech cardinal numbers one through four allow the nouns and adjectives they modify to take any case , but numbers over five place these nouns and adjectives in the genitive case when the entire expression is in nominative or accusative case . The Czech <unk> is an example of this feature ; it is shown here as the subject of a hypothetical sentence , and declined as genitive for numbers five and up . 
 Numerical words decline for case and , for numbers one and two , for gender . Numbers one through five are shown below as examples , and have some of the most exceptions among Czech numbers . The number one has declension patterns identical to those of the demonstrative pronoun , to . 
 Although Czech 's main grammatical numbers are singular and plural , a vestigial dual number remains . Some nouns for paired body parts have a dual form : <unk> ( hand ) — <unk> ; <unk> ( leg ) — <unk> ; <unk> ( eye ) — <unk> , and <unk> ( ear ) — <unk> . While two of these nouns are neuter in their singular forms , all dual nouns are considered feminine . Czech has no standard declension pattern for dual nouns , and their gender is relevant to their associated adjectives and verbs . 
 = = = Verb conjugation = = = 
 Czech verb conjugation is less complex than noun and adjective declension because it codes for fewer categories . Verbs agree with their subjects in person ( first , second or third ) and number ( singular or plural ) , and are conjugated for tense ( past , present or future ) . For example , the conjugated verb <unk> ( we speak ) is in the present tense and first @-@ person plural ; it is distinguished from other conjugations of the infinitive <unk> by its ending , me . 
 = = = = Aspect = = = = 
 Typical of Slavic languages , Czech marks its verbs for one of two grammatical aspects : perfective and imperfective . Most verbs are part of inflected aspect pairs — for example , <unk> ( perfective ) and <unk> ( imperfective ) . Although the verbs ' meaning is similar , in perfective verbs the action is completed and in imperfective verbs it is ongoing . This is distinct from past and present tense , and any Czech verb of either aspect can be conjugated into any of its three tenses . Aspect describes the state of the action at the time specified by the tense . 
 The verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways : by prefix or by suffix . In prefix pairs , the perfective verb has an added prefix — for example , the imperfective <unk> ( to write , to be writing ) compared with the perfective <unk> ( to write down , to finish writing ) . The most common prefixes are <unk> , o- , <unk> , s- , u- , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . In suffix pairs , a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem ; for example , the perfective verbs <unk> ( to buy ) and <unk> ( to sell ) have the imperfective forms <unk> and <unk> . <unk> verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs ( iterative and <unk> forms ) , denoting repeated or regular action . The verb <unk> ( to go ) has the iterative form <unk> ( to go repeatedly ) and the <unk> form <unk> ( to go regularly ) . 
 Many verbs have only one aspect , and verbs describing continual states of being — být ( to be ) , <unk> ( to want ) , <unk> ( to be able to ) , <unk> ( to lie down , to be lying down ) — have no perfective form . Conversely , verbs describing immediate states of change — for example , <unk> ( to become pregnant ) and <unk> se ( to become enthusiastic ) — have no imperfective aspect . 
 = = = = Tense and mood = = = = 
 Although Czech 's use of present and future tense is largely similar to that of English , the language uses past tense to represent the English present perfect and past perfect ; <unk> <unk> could mean she ran , she has run or she had run . 
 In some contexts , Czech 's perfective present ( which differs from the English present perfect ) implies future action ; in others , it connotes habitual action . As a result , the language has a proper future tense to minimize ambiguity . The future tense does not involve conjugating the verb describing an action to be undertaken in the future ; instead , the future form of být ( as shown in the table at left ) is placed before the infinitive ( for example , <unk> <unk> — " I will eat " ) . 
 This conjugation is not followed by být itself , so future @-@ oriented expressions involving nouns , adjectives , or prepositions ( rather than verbs ) omit být . " I will be happy " is translated as <unk> <unk> ( not <unk> být <unk> ) . 
 The infinitive form ends in t ( archaically , ti ) . It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs ( for example , <unk> <unk> <unk> — " I can hear you " ) . Czech verbs have three grammatical moods : indicative , imperative and conditional . The imperative mood adds specific endings for each of three person ( or number ) categories : <unk> / -i / <unk> for second @-@ person singular , <unk> / <unk> / <unk> for second @-@ person plural and <unk> / <unk> / <unk> for first @-@ person plural . The conditional mood is formed with a particle after the past @-@ tense verb . This mood indicates possible events , expressed in English as " I would " or " I wish " . 
 = = = = Classes = = = = 
 Most Czech verbs fall into one of five classes , which determine their conjugation patterns . The future tense of být would be classified as a Class I verb because of its endings . Examples of the present tense of each class and some common irregular verbs follow in the tables below : 
 = = Orthography = = 
 Czech has one of the most phonemic orthographies of all European languages . Its thirty @-@ one graphemes represent thirty sounds ( in most dialects , i and y have the same sound ) , and it contains only one <unk> : ch , which follows h in the alphabet . As a result , some of its characters have been used by phonologists to denote corresponding sounds in other languages . The characters q , w and x appear only in foreign words . The <unk> ( <unk> ) is used with certain letters to form new characters : <unk> , ž , and č , as well as <unk> , ě , ř , <unk> , and <unk> ( the latter five uncommon outside Czech ) . The last two letters are sometimes written with a comma above ( <unk> , an abbreviated <unk> ) because of their height . The character ó exists only in loanwords and onomatopoeia . 
 Unlike most European languages , Czech distinguishes vowel length ; long vowels are indicated by an acute accent or , occasionally with ů , a ring . Long u is usually written ú at the beginning of a word or morpheme ( <unk> , <unk> ) and ů elsewhere , except for loanwords ( <unk> ) or onomatopoeia ( <unk> ) . Long vowels and ě are not considered separate letters . 
 Czech typographical features not associated with phonetics generally resemble those of most Latin European languages , including English . Proper nouns , honorifics , and the first letters of quotations are capitalized , and punctuation is typical of other Latin European languages . Writing of ordinal numerals is similar to most European languages . The Czech language uses a decimal comma instead of a decimal point . When writing a long number , spaces between every three numbers ( e.g. between hundreds and thousands ) may be used for better orientation in handwritten texts , but not in decimal places , like in English . The number 1 @,@ 234 @,@ 567 @.@ 8910 may be written as 1234567 @,@ 8910 or 1 234 567 @,@ 8910 . Ordinal numbers ( 1st ) use a point as in German ( 1 . ) . In proper noun phrases ( except personal names ) , only the first word is capitalized ( Pražský <unk> , Prague Castle ) .

 According to Article 1 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights : 
 Czech : <unk> <unk> se <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> co do <unk> a <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> v <unk> <unk> . 
 English : " All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights . They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood . " 
 = Joseph Brittan = 
 Dr. Joseph Brittan ( 12 January 1805 – 27 October 1867 ) , a surgeon , newspaper editor , and provincial councillor , was one of the dominant figures in early Christchurch , New Zealand . Born into a middle @-@ class family in southern England , he caused a scandal by marrying his deceased wife 's sister . As was not unusual at the time , this was responded to by emigrating , and he followed his younger brother Guise Brittan to Christchurch , where he and his wife arrived in February 1852 with four children . Joseph Brittan soon got involved in the usual activities of early settlers and gained prominence in doing so . He had bought 100 acres on 10 July 1851 and took up 50 of this to the east of Christchurch that he converted to farmland . There , he built the family residence , and the suburb of Linwood was subsequently named after Brittan 's farm and homestead of Linwood House . 
 The members of the Brittan family were devout Anglicans and had a close association with the neighbouring Holy Trinity Avonside , where Guise Brittan was a lay reader . William Rolleston became Joseph Brittan 's son @-@ in @-@ law in 1865 , when he married his only surviving daughter Mary ; Rolleston was elected Canterbury 's third Superintendent just months after Brittan 's death . 
 Brittan was a member of the Canterbury Provincial Council for just over three years . He served as Provincial Secretary from 1855 to 1857 and was expected to succeed James FitzGerald as the second Superintendent of the Canterbury Province , but was beaten by William Sefton Moorhouse in October 1857 . He established the third newspaper in Canterbury , the Canterbury Standard , which existed for 12 years until shortly before Brittan 's death . Brittan was a very eloquent speaker , but he had a biting and sarcastic character , and was disliked , and even feared , by some . Later in life , he suffered from gout and frequent headaches , and this together with financial trouble , often made him irritable and impatient . He died at his homestead in October 1867 after a long period of declining health . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Joseph Brittan was born on 12 January 1805 in Bristol , England , into a respectable middle @-@ class family that originated in Bristol . His father was a brewer . He was listed in Kelly 's 1848 Directory of Dorset for Sherborne under the heading " Traders " as " agent to Royal Exchange & fire office , " and also with his brother William G as " proprietors of ' Sherborne & Yeovil Mercury ' " . He lived at some point in Linwood , Hampshire . His first wife was Elizabeth Mary Chandler with whom he had seven children . Three of them died in infancy , and then his wife died in 1849 , two weeks after the birth and death of their last child . The surviving children were Joseph ( Joe ) , Arthur , Elizabeth Mary ( Mary ) and Frances ( Frank ) . 
 Brittan married his deceased wife 's sister Sophia as his second wife . This was not legal in England or acceptable to the Church of England . He intended to marry in Denmark where it was legal and the necessary documents for the application were eventually collected and countersigned by the lord Mayor of London on 1 September 1851 . However , for some reason the wedding was performed in Gretna Green in Scotland . As was not unusual at the time , having caused such a scandal was responded to by emigrating , which the newly @-@ weds did a month after the ceremony . They sailed for Christchurch in New Zealand on the William Hyde with his other sister @-@ in law and her 2 children , which left Deal , Kent on 21 October 1851 . Brittan 's younger brother William Guise Brittan ( known as Guise Brittan ) had immigrated to Christchurch earlier aboard the Sir George Seymour in 1850 . Guise Brittan had married Louisa Chandler , a sister of Joseph 's wives . Charles Fooks , who by this time was in Melbourne was married to another of the Chandler sisters ; his wife and children did not travel with him , though . Instead , Mrs Fooks and her two daughters came out on the William Hyde together with Joseph Brittan and family . Also on board was some livestock brought by Joseph Brittan , including a Devon cow , ducks , geese , pheasants , and some rabbits . 
 During the journey , Brittan performed the duties of the ship 's surgeon . He and the ship 's chaplain produced a play , The Merchant of Venice , and his contribution was to invite women to act the female roles , which was unusual for the time and a hot topic of conversation causing great amusement . Arriving in Lyttelton on 5 February 1852 , most of the immigrants had to find somewhere to live and many slept in tents or under the open sky . The Brittans were among the fortunate few , as a house on Christchurch 's Hereford Street had been arranged for them by Guise Brittan . Like everybody else who was heading for Christchurch , upon disembarking from the ship they had to make their way over the Port Hills then follow the steep Bridle Path to reach the city . They carried as many of their possessions as possible , but following months at sea , their fitness was rather poor . The remainder of their possessions was shipped by whaleboat around the coast and up the Avon River , which was a dangerous undertaking due to the Sumner sand bar located at the entrance to the Avon Heathcote Estuary . 
 = = Life in New Zealand = = 
 Christchurch , still a very small settlement ( it had around 140 buildings in early 1852 ) , already had two doctors , so Brittan 's services in that area were not required . Instead , he followed his brother 's interest and became involved in land speculation . He bought rural section ( RS ) 300 , a triangular piece of land of 50 acres ( 20 ha ) along Canal Reserve ( later called Linwood Avenue ) , with the northern tip of the land touching the Avon River . He leased the adjacent RS 301 , which he later purchased . In total , the property had 110 acres ( 45 ha ) , which was in addition to land he owned at <unk> Bush . 
 Brittan converted the land in Avonside to farming , with 10 acres ( 40 @,@ 000 m2 ) set aside for a homestead , garden and orchard . He called the property Linwood after his place in Hampshire . Linwood House was ready in 1857 and the family moved there from their first home on Hereford Street . Adjacent to his farm was Holy Trinity Avonside , which at the time was a cob church . On 24 February 1857 , it became the first Anglican church in Canterbury consecrated by Bishop Harper , and Guise Brittan , as churchwarden , read the lesson at the service . The entire Brittan family had a close connection to the church , with Joseph Brittan helping to raise money for its construction , and Mary Brittan singing in the church choir . They faithfully attended church on Sundays , and when subscriptions were taken for the construction of ChristChurch Cathedral , Brittan pledged a generous ₤ 100 . 
 Brittan had sundry interests and immediately upon arriving in Christchurch , joined others in various activities . He played cricket in Hagley Park within a fortnight of reaching Christchurch , and later helped improve the grounds and raised money for fencing the area . He also pursued horse racing , later bred horses , and hosted Canterbury 's first steeplechase on his Linwood farm . The Brittans enjoyed music , and not only did Sophia play her piano brought from England , but Joseph played a portable harmonium . He joined a musical group in the port town of Lyttelton , which in the early years was culturally more important than Christchurch , and walked there over the Bridle Path with his instrument strapped to his back . Musical evenings were also held at the Brittan home . 
 = = = Newspaper proprietorship = = = 
 Before they emigrated , Joseph and Guise Brittan had been proprietors of the Sherborne Mercury , a newspaper covering Dorset and outlying areas . In his new country Brittan continued this line of work , becoming the founder , proprietor and editor , of the Canterbury Standard , published from 1854 to 1866 . The advertisement announcing this new paper appeared in the Lyttelton Times in August 1853 . Owned in part by William Thomson and James Willis , the paper was first published on 3 June 1854 , and became the third newspaper in Canterbury , following the Lyttelton Times ( first published in 1851 ) and the short @-@ lived Guardian and Canterbury Advertiser ( published for three months in 1852 ) . 
 Brittan was also part of a ten @-@ member syndicate that in February 1862 attempted to formalise the ownership of another Christchurch newspaper , The Press , which had been founded in the previous year . A deed of association for " The Proprietors of The Press " was drafted , but surprisingly , the deed was not executed . Four months later Brittan 's political colleague , James FitzGerald , who had no funds , was the sole owner " through the liberality of the proprietors " , as he called it later . Part of Brittan 's interest in The Press was its declared opposition to the proposal to connect Christchurch and Lyttelton via a rail tunnel , a project that he himself was strongly opposed to . Brittan and Henry Jacobs , the first headmaster of Christchurch 's first school , Christ 's College , are listed as two major writers for The Press during its early years . Before mid @-@ 1863 FitzGerald had a prolonged absence from Christchurch , and Brittan became the acting editor of The Press . In 1866 the Canterbury Standard was sold at auction to The Press , which within days , on 23 April , stopped its publication . 
 = = = Political career = = = 
 Elections were first held in New Zealand in the second half of 1853 , and two levels of government were introduced : a House of Representatives at the national level , and Provincial Councils for the six provinces . Brittan first stood for public office in 1855 , when membership of the Canterbury Provincial Council was expanded and various seats across many electorates became available . As a resident of Hereford Street , he stood in the Town of Christchurch electorate , where two positions were to be filled . For weeks campaigning filled the newspapers , with candidates using derogatory language towards each other , and Brittan being accused of " assiduously frequenting the public houses " . When the nomination meeting was held on 8 March in Market Square , only Brittan and Dr Alfred Charles Barker were nominated , and both were thus declared elected . 
 In May 1855 , the Executive Council , led by John Hall as Provincial Secretary , resigned . James FitzGerald , the Province 's first Superintendent , tasked Brittan to form a new Executive Council , and he succeeded Hall as Provincial Secretary . While FitzGerald was attending the first session of the 2nd Parliament in Auckland in 1856 , Brittan deputised for him . Brittan resigned as Provincial Secretary in February 1857 and was succeeded by Richard Packer , but remained on the Provincial Council until the end of the first term in July 1857 , when he did not seek re @-@ election . 
 Later in 1857 , FitzGerald resigned from Parliament on the advice of his doctors , and also decided not to seek re @-@ election as provincial Superintendent . Robert Heaton Rhodes offered a requisition to Brittan to make himself available for the by @-@ election that would result from FitzGerald 's resignation from Parliament in the Lyttelton electorate , but Brittan replied that he could not absent himself from his private affairs as yet ; Parliament at that time met in Auckland , and the 1858 session lasted from 10 April to 21 August , which required an absence from home for several months . Instead , Crosbie Ward , the editor and proprietor of the Lyttelton Times , was the only person nominated on 28 May 1858 and was thus declared elected . 
 The public generally expected that Brittan would succeed FitzGerald as Superintendent , but this did not transpire . Brittan became a candidate for the position when he published his political views in a long letter that appeared in almost all editions of the bi @-@ weekly Lyttelton Times over a period of several months . William Sefton Moorhouse announced his candidacy a few months later , but was not only less experienced than Brittan , but a less polished public speaker . William Richmond , who visited from Taranaki during the election campaign , remarked that " Joe Brittan is a much cleverer man than Moorhouse who seems a softie " . The idea of building the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel became the central issue of the election campaign . Moorhouse was a strong proponent of the project , whilst Brittan was opposed to it . Moorhouse received much support for his position from the residents of Lyttelton , as evidenced by the results of the election : of the 12 @,@ 000 residents of Canterbury , including 3 @,@ 205 in Christchurch and 1 @,@ 944 in Lyttelton , both candidates received 206 votes from the residents of Christchurch . However , overall results were a victory for Moorhouse by 727 votes to 352 . Moorhouse later began the project by turning the first sod on 17 July 1861 . Helping Moorhouse in his 30 October 1857 election victory was the support of John Ollivier , a skilled orator who was regarded as the ' kingmaker ' and had a reputation as ' perhaps the best after @-@ dinner speaker ' . 
 Following his January 1860 resignation from Parliament , Ollivier spearheaded a requisition , broadly supported by influential people , to have Brittan make himself available for the resulting by @-@ election in the Christchurch Country electorate . Brittan declined the requisition , mostly because he was opposed to the rail tunnel scheme which had overwhelming support by the population , and he could not see himself being their representative if he disagreed with this popular public opinion . Isaac Thomas Cookson , who had earlier supported the Brittan requisition , was elected . 
 On 30 August 1861 , a nomination meeting was held for the election of a Canterbury Superintendent , and to fill the four positions on the Provincial Council available in the City of Christchurch electorate . Moorhouse was returned unopposed as Superintendent , and ten candidates were nominated for the Provincial Council . The election was held the next day , and Brittan topped the polls with 140 votes , followed by Isaac Thomas Cookson with 139 , Frederick Thompson with 114 , and Richard Westenra with 100 , these being the men who were elected . Isaac Luck , Edward Reece , George Wilmer , William Barnard , John Cracroft Wilson , and Richard Taylor were defeated . 
 Within months , Moorhouse prorogued the council , and another election was scheduled . Seven candidates were nominated for the four positions available in the City of Christchurch electorate . At the election in May 1862 , Brittan again topped the poll , with Isaac Thomas Cookson and Richard Westenra being re @-@ elected , and Samuel Bealey also being elected . In September of the same year , Brittan announced his resignation from the Provincial Council , citing declining health , but it is thought that the loss of his son earlier that year was also a factor . Brittan was succeeded by James Somerville Turnbull , who was elected unopposed . William Wilson , who later became the first Mayor of Christchurch , publicly thanked Brittan at Turnbull 's nomination meeting for the years of service that he had given . 
 In mid @-@ 1863 , Brittan was appointed resident magistrate for Christchurch and <unk> , succeeding John Hall . Declining health made this position untenable for him , and he resigned after nine months , being succeeded by Charles Bowen . 
 = = = Family , death and legacy = = = 
 Brittan had four children who survived childhood , all with his first wife . The eldest son , Joe , appears to have been of a simple mind , was never tasked with important roles , and later lived as a recluse , being regarded as a burden to the family . His two younger brothers , Arthur and Frank , were sent to Christ 's College . Mary was likely first educated privately with her nieces at the home of her aunt . In 1854 , a private School for Young Ladies was opened on Oxford Terrace , which she attended until she was 16 . After the family moved to Linwood House in 1857 , Mary continued at that school as a boarder . 
 Tragedy struck on 1 January 1862 , when Arthur Brittan drowned in the Avon River while learning to swim . He got entangled in watercress , which the Brittans themselves had introduced to the Avon , and it took a half @-@ hour for his body to be recovered . Arthur had left school by then and was helping his father on the farm . Joseph Brittan was heartbroken and there are indications that he went through a period of depression . Soon after the drowning , he advertised for both a dairyman and a farmworker , and even put Linwood House up for sale , though no property transaction was recorded . 
 William Rolleston , at the time Provincial Secretary , proposed to Mary Brittan in early 1865 . He was 34 at the time , and she was 19 . Both Joseph and Sophia Brittan were opposed to this marriage , which is surprising , given that Rolleston was intelligent , well educated , successful , and even of higher social standing . They thought he was too old for their daughter , and that she was too young to marry . Perhaps Sophia Brittan did not want to lose her daughter , who was in effect running the household and entertaining guests , as she was often too ill to look after these tasks herself . Despite parental objections , an engagement was announced , soon after which Rolleston was offered and accepted the role of Under Secretary for Native Affairs , requiring a move to Wellington . Hence , the wedding went ahead on 24 May 1865 at Avonside Trinity Church , after which the newly @-@ weds moved to the capital . 
 Sophia Brittan was often ill , and health was a dominant issue in her life . Joseph Brittan also had his problems , suffering from frequent headaches and gout , and together with financial trouble , he was often irritable and impatient . Joseph Brittan 's health declined during 1867 . <unk> for the family were the financial affairs , with various debts that only Joseph knew about . Rolleston tried to give financial advice to both Sophia and Frank Brittan , but he was ignored . Joseph Brittan died on 27 October 1867 at Linwood House . He was buried at Holy Trinity Avonside next to his son Arthur , and when Sophia Brittan died in August 1877 she was buried near her husband . Brittan 's oldest son Joseph died in 1924 , and an inscription for him was placed on his father 's grave stone . 
 Brittan 's daughter 's biographer ( Rosamund Rolleston , his great @-@ granddaughter ) described him as " a man of ability and a polished speaker [ his ] biting , sarcastic manner made him both feared and disliked " , and as " quarrelsome and uncompromising " . In his obituary , he was described " as a speaker [ who ] took very high rank , possessing a force and fluency of expression , a power of lucid statement , and a readiness in debate , which with one or two exceptions have never been equalled in the Council . " Brittan Street was named for him and first appeared in street directories in 1892 . Linwood House , which fronted onto both Linwood Avenue and Brittan Street , was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a class D heritage building in 1982 , and with a change of the classification system later , it later became a Category II listing . Significantly damaged in both the September 2010 and the February 2011 earthquakes , Civil Defence ordered the building 's demolition in March 2011 , which was carried out later that year . 
 = Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero = 
 The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero or Virgin Islands dwarf gecko ( Sphaerodactylus parthenopion ) is a species of gecko and also one of the smallest terrestrial vertebrates . It has only been found on three of the British Virgin Islands : Virgin Gorda , Tortola , and Moskito Island ( also spelled " Mosquito Island " ) . It was discovered in 1964 and is suspected to be a close relative of Sphaerodactylus nicholsi , a dwarf sphaero from the nearby island of Puerto Rico . It shares its range with the big @-@ scaled least gecko ( S. macrolepis ) , which is found in leaf litter . Unlike this larger gecko , the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero lives on drier hillsides , yet prefers moist microhabitats found under rocks because it lacks the adaptations necessary for preventing water loss , which is a significant problem due to its small body size . 
 The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero has a deep brown colour on its upper side , often with a speckling of darker scales . On average , it measures 18 mm ( 0 @.@ 71 in ) from its snout to its vent , and is nearly as small as a U.S. dime . At most , it weighs 0 @.@ 15 g ( 0 @.@ 0053 oz ) . There are several stripes or bars of lighter colouration behind the eyes and at the top of the neck that help distinguish it . There are no differences in colouration between males and females , although females are slightly larger in size . Its tail will regenerate when broken off . Little is known about its population size or its biology . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero , also referred to as the Virgin Islands dwarf gecko , was discovered in the summer of 1964 by biologist Richard Thomas during a collecting trip along the dry , wooded slopes of Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands . The holotype for Sphaerodactylus parthenopion , MCZ <unk> , was an adult female collected on 12 August 1964 on a hillside above Pond Bay . A total of eight paratypes were collected on Virgin Gorda and used to describe the new species . 
 Classified as a species of dwarf sphaero or dwarf gecko ( genus Sphaerodactylus ) , it is characterised not only by its small body size , but also by a distinctive scale colouration pattern on its head , scales that are small but keeled ( having a central ridge ) and imbricate on its upper ( dorsal ) side ; a generally uniform dark colouration of the dorsal side , a lack of granular scales on the mid @-@ dorsal area , and a lack of colouration patterns around the shoulders ( scapular region ) and the pelvis ( sacral region ) . 
 Despite striking differences in appearance , S. parthenopion may be most closely related to S. nicholsi . Like the diminutive S. parthenopion in the Virgin Islands , S. nicholsi , the smallest endemic <unk> in Puerto Rico , is very small . The geographic range of another species , S. townsendi , divides these two closely related populations , suggesting that S. townsendi evolved after S. parthenopion and S. nicholsi diverged . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero is one of the smallest known amniotes ( which includes 23 @,@ 000 species of reptiles , birds , and mammals ) , with an average body size ( measured as the snout – vent length or SVL ) of 18 mm ( 0 @.@ 71 in ) and a maximum body mass of 0 @.@ 15 g ( 0 @.@ 0053 oz ) , but ranging as low as 0 @.@ 043 g ( 0 @.@ 0015 oz ) and averaging 0 @.@ 117 g ( 0 @.@ 0041 oz ) . The only known amniote that is smaller is the closely related S. <unk> , which measures 16 mm ( 0 @.@ 63 in ) and weighs a maximum of 0 @.@ 14 g ( 0 @.@ <unk> oz ) . 
 Typically , the species has a deep brown colouration on the dorsal side and legs , often with a scattering or a fine pattern of interconnected darker scales . The species has a preocular transverse bar ( a line of coloured scales in front of the eyes at the base of the snout ) , although this can be hard to see in some individuals . Along each side and directly behind the eyes , a narrow , dark @-@ edged , yellow @-@ brown postocular stripe crosses the temple and fades out near the base of the head . In the occipital region , on top of the head behind the eyes , an almost oval @-@ shaped , dark @-@ edged , yellow @-@ brown bar stretches from one side of the head to the other and sometimes connects with the postocular stripes . The dark brown scales on the dorsal side cross over to the ventral side ( underside ) and fade out , although many scales retain dark edges . The ventral side is light grey or cream . The tail is mostly yellowish @-@ brown with occasional clusters or short lines of darker scales . The gular ( throat ) pattern has faint to bold lines of light scales running laterally . 
 There is no sexual dichromatism in this species ( the genders do not differ in colour ) , although females may be larger than males , with the SVL of females averaging 18 mm ( 0 @.@ 71 in ) , but only 16 mm ( 0 @.@ 63 in ) in males . The snout is moderate in length and blunt . The tail regenerates if broken off . 
 The dorsal scales are generally small , acute , keeled , imbricate , and flattened , while the throat and pectoral ( chest ) scales are keeled . <unk> ( bumpy ) scales are found on the top of the head and the anterior neck , while the scales on the middle of the neck are keeled , acute , flattened , and imbricate . In the middle of the back , there is some crowding and size reduction in the scales , and none of these scales are granular . On the dorsal side of the tail , the scales are acute , keeled , imbricate , and flattened . On the underside of the tail , the scales are smooth , rounded , and enlarged towards the centre of the tail ( mid @-@ ventrally ) . The ventral scales are rounded , smooth , cycloid ( have a smooth outer edge ) , and imbricate . The scales on the ventral caudal ( head ) scales are smooth , cycloid , and enlarged mid @-@ ventrally . 
 The count of dorsal scales , from axilla ( armpit ) to groin , averages 32 with a range of 30 to 35 . The ventral count from axilla to groin along the <unk> line averages 28 scales and ranges from 26 to 29 . The scales around the midbody average approximately 52 and range from 50 to 55 . There are two <unk> and one to three ( usually two ) internasal scales . There are two to three ( usually three ) scales from the upper lip to the eye ( upper labials ) . On the fourth toe of the right foot , there are eight or nine ( usually eight ) lamellae , or plate @-@ like scales that provide traction for geckos . The escutcheons ( scales around the genital region ) are relatively small and only slightly extend onto the thighs , varying from three to five scales in length and 11 to 13 scales in width . 
 = = = Comparisons with related species = = = 
 S. nicholsi from Puerto Rico is both bulkier and larger than the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero , measuring 20 to 22 mm ( 0 @.@ 8 to 0 @.@ 9 in ) from snout to vent . It also differs in the size of its dorsal scales , which is reflected in scale count comparisons . S. nicholsi has 19 to 24 dorsal scales from axilla to groin , whereas S. parthenopion has 30 to 35 . Also , S. nicholsi has only 34 to 42 scales around the midbody compared to 50 to 55 in S. parthenopion , and its ventral scales from axilla to groin range from 21 to 26 , which is still less than 26 to 29 in S. parthenopion . S. nicholsi typically has one internasal scale versus the two more commonly seen in S. parthenopion . The escutcheons are also larger in male S. nicholsi , on average . In terms of colouration , both species are very similar , but S. nicholsi usually has a crescent @-@ shaped pattern on its head that touches the postocular stripes , instead of an oval @-@ shaped pattern that may or may not reach the stripes . Also , its postocular stripes run the length of its body and tail instead of ending on the neck . The dorsolateral stripes of S. nicholsi converge to make a dark @-@ edged <unk> or Y @-@ shaped pattern in the sacral ( pelvic ) region . The majority of S. nicholsi have a pattern on the scapular ( shoulder ) region consisting of two small pale dots encompassed by small regions of black . 
 The big @-@ scaled least gecko is significantly larger than the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero , measuring 25 to 30 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 to 1 @.@ 18 in ) from snout to vent . It also has larger , courser scales . According to Thomas , " S. macrolepis has a pattern of dark lateral stripes and dorsal spotting on a tan or light brown ground color with a boldly black @-@ edged pair of scapular spots ( females ) or a nearly uniform yellow @-@ brown body color , weak or absent scapular pattern , and contrasting head pattern of black vermiculations [ irregular wavy lines ] on a grey ground color or unicolor yellow or orange heads ( male ) . " 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Originally found only on the island of Virgin Gorda , it has since been reported on Tortola and Moskito Island . Its range is sometimes estimated to encompass the entire British Virgin Islands , although the original expedition by Thomas did not find any specimens on Tortola , Anegada , or other smaller islands , nor in the United States Virgin Islands of Saint Croix , Saint Thomas , and Saint John . Its distribution is considered unusual because despite being separated from its closest relative , S. nicholsi in Puerto Rico , another species , the Puerto Rican Crested Toad ( Bufo lemur ) , has a geographic range that includes both islands , yet it has not diverged . 
 The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero appears to favour dry ( xeric ) scrub forests — often mixed with cacti and thorny scrub — on rocky hillsides . It has been found at sea level , although not on the beach among the seaweed litter or in piles of rotting palm debris in the littoral zone , like the more abundant and larger big @-@ scaled least gecko ( S. macrolepis ) with which it shares its range . Also unlike the big @-@ scaled least gecko , they do not " swarm " in the leaf litter , but are only uncommonly found hiding under rocks , which are considered moist or mesic microhabitats within their dry ecological niche . 
 = = Ecology and behaviour = = 
 As with other dwarf <unk> , little is known about the ecology and behaviour of the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero . Because of its high surface @-@ area @-@ to @-@ volume ratio that results from its diminutive size , the species was thought to be susceptible to water loss , so it has been studied to understand how it survives in its semi @-@ arid habitat . Unlike desert @-@ dwelling lizards , the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero lacks special adaptations to prevent desiccation and loses water at a rate similar to that of lizards from mesic habitats . From size differences alone , it loses water 70 % faster than the larger and sympatric big @-@ scaled least gecko . It survives instead by inhabiting humid microhabitats in its dry environment , by adjusting its reproductive cycle so that hatchlings emerge during the time of year with the highest precipitation , and by reducing activity during the driest parts of the day . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Too little data has been gathered to assess the population size and trend of the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero . It has been reported as " moderately common " , although difficult to find because of its size and ability to blend into its surroundings . Its distribution across the British Virgin Islands seems to be limited , and development may affect it further . 
 In early 2011 , the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero gained international attention when Sir Richard Branson announced plans to introduce lemurs — endangered primates from Madagascar — to Moskito Island as part of a captive breeding project for conservation purposes . Biologists , conservationists , and the general public quickly voiced concerns over the impact that would have on the native species of the island . In particular , people feared that the lemurs would wipe out the local population of Virgin Islands dwarf <unk> , which was referred to as " one of the world 's rarest lizards " , because of the lemurs ' " aggressive , omnivorous " behaviour . Other researchers instead focused on concerns about the lemurs ' ability to thrive or the pathogens they might introduce . The leader of Branson 's environmental impact assessment agreed that caution was needed with the introduction , even before the plans to introduce the lemurs were announced . Regarding the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero , Branson stated that the concerns were misplaced because lemurs mostly eat plant material and would rarely eat geckos if at all . However , Branson ultimately backed down , stating , " I will keep the lemurs enclosed whilst we get experts to conduct further surveys on geckos and particularly the dwarf geckos . If these studies indicate any real risk to these geckos , we will keep the lemurs enclosed . " 
 = HMS Firedrake ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Firedrake was an F @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy during the early 1930s . Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion , the ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935 – 36 during the Abyssinia Crisis . During the Spanish Civil War of 1936 – 39 , she spent much time in Spanish waters , enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict . 
 Several weeks after the start of the Second World War in September 1939 , Firedrake helped to sink a German submarine and took part in the Norwegian Campaign in early 1940 . She was sent to Gibraltar in mid @-@ 1940 and formed part of Force H where she escorted many Malta convoys in the Mediterranean and helped to sink an Italian submarine . Firedrake participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento and screened the capital ships of Force H as they bombarded Genoa before she was damaged by an Italian bomb in mid @-@ 1941 . After her repairs were completed the ship became a convoy escort in the Atlantic at the beginning of 1942 . Firedrake was torpedoed and sunk by a German U @-@ boat in late 1942 with the loss of most of her crew . 
 = = Description = = 
 The F @-@ class ships were repeats of the preceding E @-@ class . They displaced 1 @,@ 405 long tons ( 1 @,@ 428 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 940 long tons ( 1 @,@ 970 t ) at deep load . The ships had an overall length of 329 feet ( 100 @.@ 3 m ) , a beam of 33 feet 3 inches ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines , each driving one propeller shaft , using steam provided by three Admiralty three @-@ drum boilers . The turbines developed a total of 36 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 27 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 35 @.@ 5 knots ( 65 @.@ 7 km / h ; 40 @.@ 9 mph ) . Firedrake barely exceeded her designed speed during her sea trials . She carried a maximum of 470 long tons ( 480 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 6 @,@ 350 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 760 km ; 7 @,@ 310 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ships ' complement was 145 officers and ratings . 
 The ships mounted four 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) Mark IX guns in single mounts , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' in sequence from front to rear . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , they had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun . The F class was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began . 
 = = = Wartime modifications = = = 
 By October 1940 , Firedrake had her rear torpedo tube mount replaced by a 12 @-@ pounder AA gun . While the ship was under repair in late 1941 , ' Y ' gun had was removed to allow a total of 70 depth charges to be stowed aboard . Several other changes also probably happened during this refit , notably two single 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) Oerlikon light AA guns were installed abreast the bridge and a Type 286 short @-@ range surface search radar was fitted as was a HF / DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Firedrake , the sixth ship of her name in the Royal Navy , was built by Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company , Wallsend , although her hull was sub @-@ contracted to Vickers Armstrongs . She was laid down at their Walker , Newcastle upon Tyne shipyard on 5 July , launched on 28 June 1934 , the same day as her sister ship , Fame , and completed on 30 April 1935 . The ship cost 243 @,@ 966 pounds , excluding government @-@ furnished equipment like the armament . Firedrake was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla ( DF ) of the Home Fleet , but was sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet , together with most of her sisters , during the Abyssinian crisis , in September and remained there until December . Firedrake was refitted at Gibraltar from 14 December 1935 to 11 February 1936 . She briefly returned home to give leave to the crew later that month , but she returned to the Mediterranean in March and remained there until July when she began a refit at Sheerness Dockyard . 
 Upon its completion on 30 September , the ship returned to the Mediterranean and began to enforce the arms embargo imposed on both sides in the Spanish Civil War by the Non @-@ Intervention Committee until June 1937 . On 23 April 1937 , Firedrake , together with the battlecruiser Hood , escorted a British merchantman into Bilbao harbour despite the presence of the Nationalist cruiser Almirante Cervera that attempted to blockade the port . Firedrake returned to Gibraltar in September and resumed patrols in Spanish waters until November when she began another refit at Sheerness that lasted until 30 December . The ship spent another two months at Gibraltar between January and March 1938 and then patrolled the Spanish coastline in the Bay of Biscay a year later . The 6th DF was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939 , five months before the start of World War II . Firedrake remained assigned to it until June 1940 , escorting the larger ships of the fleet . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 In September 1939 Firedrake was assigned to the Home Fleet and based at Scapa Flow . In the first month of hostilities she was part of an anti @-@ submarine hunting group centred on the aircraft carrier Ark Royal . On 14 September , the carrier was unsuccessfully attacked by the German submarine U @-@ 39 . Firedrake , in company with her sisters Faulknor and Foxhound , counter @-@ attacked and sank U @-@ 39 north @-@ west of Ireland . On 5 October , the ship rescued survivors from the small freighter SS Glen <unk> . In February 1940 , she was one of the escorts for Convoy TC 3 carrying troops from Canada to the UK . Firedrake was slightly damaged going alongside the destroyer Icarus at Invergordon on 28 March and was repaired between 2 and 26 April at Cardiff , Wales . 
 In the Norwegian Campaign , she supported the Allied landings on 12 – 13 May at Bjerkvik during the Battle of Narvik . The ship continued to provide fire support during the battle for the rest of the month . During the nights of 30 and 31 May , Firedrake helped to evacuate troops from Bodø to Harstad and Borkenes to await further evacuation . She was one of the ships that escorted the troop ships evacuating the troops from the Narvik area on 7 and 8 June . She was slightly damaged by splinters during an aerial attack on 23 May and again on 12 June when her port steering motor and ' A ' gun were knocked out of action ; her repairs were completed eight days later . 
 Firedrake was briefly assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla until she rejoined the 8th DF in mid @-@ August as they escorted the battleship Valiant and the new carrier Illustrious from the UK to Gibraltar , arriving on 29 August . The next day , Fury and Force H covered the passage of Valiant and Illustrious through the Western Mediterranean to rendezvous with the Mediterranean Fleet ( Operation Hats ) . On 18 October , she sank the Italian submarine <unk> east of Gibraltar together with the destroyer Wrestler and two Saro London flying boats of 202 Squadron RAF . A boarding party captured cipher and operational documents aboard the boat which led to the sinking of the Italian submarine Lafolè two days later . Between them , the two destroyers rescued 5 officers and 43 ratings . Firedrake escorted the carriers Argus and Ark Royal during Operations Coat and White in November as they flew off aircraft for Malta . The ship escorted Force F to Malta during Operation Collar later in the month and participated in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November , where she was part of the screen for the battlecruiser Renown and the battleship Ramillies . 
 On 1 January 1941 , Firedrake was one of the ships that intercepted a Vichy French convoy off Mellila and seized all four merchant ships of the convoy . Later that month , she was involved in Operation Excess . On 31 January 1941 , Force H departed Gibraltar to carry out Operation Picket , an unsuccessful night torpedo attack by eight of Ark Royal 's Fairey Swordfish on the Tirso Dam in Sardinia . The British ships returned to Gibraltar on 4 February and began preparing for Operation Grog , a naval bombardment of Genoa , that was successfully carried out five days later . The destroyer accidentally ran aground in fog near Gibraltar on 1 March and received preliminary repairs there until 21 April . Final repairs were completed at Chatham Royal Dockyard on 19 June and she rejoined the 8th DF back at Gibraltar shortly afterwards . 
 During Operation Substance , Firedrake and Foxhound were each leading a column of the convoy , streaming their TSDS <unk> , through the Sicilian Narrows on 23 July when an Italian 100 @-@ kilogram ( 220 lb ) bomb near missed Firedrake and detonated off her port side . The shockwave blew in the plating over No. 1 boiler room and disabled her so that she had to be towed back to Gibraltar by the destroyer Eridge . Temporary repairs were made in Gibraltar and she was transferred to the Boston Navy Yard for repair on 23 September . Firedrake exchanged one 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch gun for additional depth charges while under repair to better suit her new role as a convoy escort . 
 After escorting Convoy NA 2 to the UK in January 1942 , the ship was assigned to Escort Group B7 of the Mid @-@ Ocean Escort Force . While escorting Convoy ON ( S ) 94 in May , the escorts drove off U @-@ 406 . Firedrake received repairs in April on the Clyde and August in Belfast . She rescued survivors from the torpedoed merchantman MV Olaf <unk> on 26 September . Two months later , the ship was detached to reinforce the escort for Convoy ON 144 on 18 November and helped to prevent any further losses to the convoy . On 16 December , while escorting Convoy ON 153 , Firedrake was torpedoed by U @-@ 211 at 19 : 11 . She broke in two ; the bow section sinking immediately at coordinates 50 ° 50 ′ N 25 ° 15 ′ W , but the stern stayed afloat until 00 : 45 . The corvette Sunflower picked up 26 survivors , but the rest of her crew of 140 men were lost .

 " Symbiosis " is the 22nd episode of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : The Next Generation . It first aired on April 18 , 1988 , in broadcast syndication . The teleplay was written by Robert Lewin , Richard Manning , and Hans Beimler , based on a story by Lewin , and the episode was directed by Win Phelps . 
 Set in the 24th century , the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Starfleet starship Enterprise @-@ D. In this episode , Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) tries to mediate a trade dispute between two co @-@ dependent neighbouring planets regarding medical supplies which turn out to be narcotic drugs . 
 The episode was written after executive producer Maurice Hurley worked on Miami Vice , which he credited for resulting in a narcotic theme in the episode . The guest cast included Judson Scott and Merritt Butrick who had both appeared in Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan ( 1982 ) . The episode received mixed reviews with criticism directed at the subject matter and the unsubtle nature of the presentation . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Enterprise attempts to rescue the freighter Sanction , which is trapped in a star 's magnetic field . An agreement is reached to transport over the crew of the freighter , but they surprisingly send over a cargo barrel first . The Enterprise crew attempts to transport the freighter 's crew , but is only successful in recovering four of them before their ship is destroyed . Two , T 'Jon ( Merritt Butrick ) and Romas ( Richard <unk> ) , are scruffy and unshaven , while the other two , Sobi ( Judson Scott ) and Langor ( Kimberly Farr ) , are groomed and well dressed . They all show relief that the barrel made it over , and little remorse for the lost ship and crewmen . Both groups start to fight over the ownership of the barrel , and are escorted to the observation lounge under guard . 
 The two pairs come from different planets within the same system . It is explained that the barrel contains Felicium , a medicine for a plague which is ravaging the planet Ornara . Felicium is produced on the planet Brekka , but the Ornarans are the only race in the system with the means of space travel ; however , the <unk> ships were all built long ago and are beginning to fail due to overuse and lack of maintenance - and the Ornarans no longer know how to repair them . Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) offers to return them each to Ornara and provide replacement parts for the remaining freighters . The Brekkans , Sobi and Langor , argue that they retain ownership of the Felicium , as the items the Ornarans offered in payment were lost on board the freighter . T 'Jon and Romas , of Ornara , are suffering from the effects of the plague , and are sent to sickbay where Dr. Beverly Crusher ( Gates McFadden ) can find no reason for their symptoms . In a gesture of goodwill following the demand of compassion from Crusher , the Brekkans offer two doses of Felicium for T 'Jon and Romas ' immediate needs . Langor explains that the entire <unk> economy and industry is devoted to producing the medicine for Ornara , whose inhabitants provide Brekka with the necessities of daily life in return . After T 'Jon and Romas take their doses , Dr. Crusher realizes that Felicium is actually a highly addictive narcotic , and the plague itself was cured long ago , so the symptoms believed to be attributed to the plague were actually withdrawal symptoms . Crusher wants to offer assistance to aid the Ornarans in breaking free of their addition , but Picard warns that the Federation cannot intervene due to the Prime Directive . He and Dr. Crusher later question the Brekkans alone and confirm that the Brekkans know the truth regarding the plague being eradicated , and the addictive nature of the medicine , and are knowingly exploiting the Ornarans because of the clear implication that Brekka 's economy would collapse if the Ornarans no longer needed Felicium . 
 The Enterprise arrives at Ornara , and Sobi and Langor have agreed to provide the Felicium to the Ornarans for later payment . However , Picard announces that as the Prime Directive prevents him from interfering in the transactions between the two planets , it also prevents him from providing any replacement parts for the aging freighters . T 'Jon and Romas are furious at the decision as it means that the trade between Ornara and Brekka will stop because the freighters can no longer make the trips without the parts . After the four are transported off the Enterprise , Picard confides to Dr. Crusher that while the Ornarans may suffer from withdrawal symptoms in the short term , this will be an opportunity for both races to advance in their own ways .

 The episode was influenced by co @-@ executive producer Maurice Hurley 's recent work on Miami Vice , and was intended to have the Enterprise come across a drug deal in progress . Hurley was also responsible for the insertion of a " Just Say No " style drugs speech by Tasha Yar ( Denise Crosby ) to Wesley Crusher ( Wil Wheaton ) , which came over the objections from the cast . 
 Guest stars in this episode included two who had previously appeared in Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan ( 1982 ) , as Sobi and T 'Jon were played by Judson Scott and Merritt Butrick respectively . Butrick had also appeared in Star Trek III : The Search for Spock ; on both occasions he portrayed David Marcus , the son of Captain James T. Kirk . Butrick - who was suffering from AIDS , was unable to afford health insurance , and was offered the role as a way of helping him , and died of AIDS less than a year after filming this episode . 
 Director Win Phelps recalled that there were numerous continuity issues throughout filming , with character motivations changing from one scene to the next . Because of changes to the script , the actors were often acting scenes that they had not seen the script for before the first take . " Symbiosis " was filmed after " Skin of Evil " , which featured the death of Tasha Yar , making this the final filmed episode with Denise Crosby as Yar until she reappeared in " Yesterday 's Enterprise " . Towards the end of the episode , as Picard and Crusher leave the cargo bay , Crosby can be seen waving goodbye to the camera behind them . LeVar Burton later used behind the scenes footage from this episode in a feature on his show Reading Rainbow .

 " Symbiosis " aired in broadcast syndication during the week commencing April 22 , 1988 . It received Nielsen ratings of 10 @.@ 8 , reflecting the percentage of all households watching the episode during its timeslot . This was the highest ratings received by the series since the broadcast of " Too Short a Season " during the preceding February . The ratings received by " Symbiosis " were not beaten until the first episode of the second season , " The Child " . 
 " Symbiosis " first aired in broadcast syndication within the United States on April 18 , 1988 . Several reviewers re @-@ watched the episode after the end of the series . Zack Handlen reviewed the episode for The A.V. Club in May 2010 . He felt that the drug use allegory could have been better refined , but praised the performance of Patrick Stewart and gave the episode an overall grade of a B. Keith DeCandido watched the episode for Tor.com , and described it as the least subtle " message " based episode since The Original Series episode " Let That Be Your Last Battlefield " . He criticised the electricity based powers of the two alien species , saying that they didn 't add anything to the plot . He gave the episode a score of four out of ten . 
 James Hunt of the website Den of Geek said that " This is one of those episodes which exemplify all that is awful about Star Trek in general . I 'm not talking about season one 's dubious production values ( which , to be fair , are considerably more even than they were when the series began ) but about the episode 's very fabric . " Michelle Erica Green for TrekNation thought that the episode could have been better if the guest cast was up to a better quality . However , she felt that the episode fell foul of several TNG season one writing errors , such as Deanna Troi 's statements breaking any mounting tension and the crew failing to do such quite simple steps such as separating feuding aliens and William Riker being held hostage for the second time in successive episodes .

 Laguna Canyon ( also called Cañada de las Lagunas , Spanish : Lagoon Canyon ) is the name of a canyon that cuts through the San Joaquin Hills in southern Orange County , California , in the United States , directly west of the city of Irvine . The canyon runs from northeast to southwest , drained on the east side by tributaries of San Diego Creek and on the west by Laguna Canyon Creek . It is deeper and more rugged on the southwestern end near Laguna Beach . 
 Geologically , the canyon likely originated millions of years ago as the result of San Diego Creek cutting through the San Joaquin Hills . Uplift diverted that stream to its present course , leaving Laguna Canyon as a wind gap . California State Route 133 runs the entire length of the canyon connecting Laguna Beach and Irvine , while California State Route 73 crosses it , running southeast @-@ northwest . A majority of the canyon is located within the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park ; small portions are part of Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park and the cities of Irvine , Laguna Beach , Laguna Woods and Aliso Viejo . 
 = = Geography and geology = = 
 Laguna Canyon is approximately 8 miles ( 13 km ) long and 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) wide at the widest points . The city of Irvine lies to the northeast , Lake Forest and Aliso Viejo to the east , the undeveloped San Joaquin Hills to the west , and Laguna Beach to the south . The drainage divide of the canyon near its northern end separates Laguna Canyon Creek from the San Diego Creek watershed . 
 State Route 133 , locally called Laguna Canyon Road , winds through Laguna Canyon for the entire length of the gorge . California State Route 73 bisects the gorge east @-@ west . The lower section of the canyon is part of the Laguna Coast Wilderness , while the upper section also has a few smaller wilderness preserves . The upper section contains the Laguna Lakes , a series of small natural lakes formed by groundwater rising along a local fault line , which are the namesake of the canyon . A section of the lower canyon within the city limits of Laguna Beach is heavily developed . The northernmost extreme of the canyon lies near a residential area that adjoins Interstate 405 . 
 The canyon was most likely formed by San Diego Creek cutting through the rising San Joaquin Hills over a span of about 1 @.@ 22 million years . At some point , however , the creek changed course , and the water gap it had formed was walled off by the mountains and became a separate watershed . The gradient of the drainage divide separating Laguna Canyon and the San Diego Creek watershed is very small , allowing for the canyon 's modern use as a transportation route . 
 = = = The creek = = = 
 Laguna Canyon Creek begins as an ephemeral creek draining a mountainside west of the valley floor down into the canyon . It is briefly culverted where it crosses under Laguna Canyon Road , but most of the upper course flows in a natural channel . It soon passes the Laguna Lakes and receives Little Sycamore Canyon from the right ; this creek drains a narrow side canyon which runs about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) eastward . The creek continues southward , and then passes beneath Laguna Canyon Rd. again and receives Camarillo Canyon , a short and steep tributary , from the right . 
 The stream then runs south under the twin California State Route 73 bridges and enters an underground culvert beneath an onramp . While in this culvert , Laurel Canyon ( which harbors a 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) waterfall ) and larger Willow Canyon join from the right , then about 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) later , the creek re @-@ emerges from underground and flows in a riprap lined channel for the next few miles . It receives its major tributary , El Toro Creek , from the left . El Toro Creek , which follows El Toro Road for much of its length , drains parts of Laguna Hills and Aliso Viejo before emptying into Laguna Canyon Creek . 
 The creek turns sharply west and then back south , then shortly after , is forced into a concrete @-@ lined box culvert that carries it through downtown Laguna Beach ( This stretch is also known as Broadway Creek . ) It then is diverted completely underground and its channel winds to an outfall at Main Beach , one of the most popular beaches in Laguna Beach . 
 = = = Modifications = = = 
 Laguna Canyon and its side tributaries have received some flood control modifications . These include debris basins at the mouth of nearly every major tributary , stretches of lined or unlined flood control channels , and other structures . The debris basins , sometimes called retention basins , are circular depressions constructed by the Orange County Flood Control Division to slow down flash floods . The upper Laguna Canyon area has a few flood control channels and the lower creek is encased entirely in one ; this begins as a riprap channel with an unlined bottom , which transitions to a concrete culvert . These improvements help to protect infrastructure in the canyon from storm and landslide damage . 
 There is little development within the main canyon , although the El Toro Creek area is primarily residential . There is also some residential and commercial development downstream of State Route 73 . The concrete channel in this area is small and undersized for major floods , which caused it to overflow in the late 1990s and again in 2010 . 
 = = Wildlife = = 
 = = = Animals = = = 
 The Laguna Canyon area supports a variety of native Southern California wildlife , including large mammals such as mountain lions , bobcats , coyotes and mule deer . Like Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park to the south , the canyon supports over one hundred species of birds . Some of its endangered species include California <unk> , cactus wren , and orange @-@ throated whiptail . Except for the Laguna Lakes , the canyon has no fish habitat , and riparian habitat is sparse because the local creeks have only seasonal flow . 
 = = = Plants = = = 
 The dominant vegetation cover of coastal sage scrub typically goes through approximately 25 @-@ year cycles , with its peak biodiversity reached in roughly 10 years after the beginning of a new 25 @-@ year period . Such periods are typically separated by wildfires , which clear away dead or dying vegetation and leave bare ground for new growth . The canyon is one of the last remaining sanctuaries for many plants native to Southern California . Approximately one hundred species of plants , most native to California , are found in Laurel and Willow Canyons alone . These include monkey flower , goldenrod , and sagebrush . 
 = = Recreation = = 
 Laguna Canyon forms the center section of an approximately 17 @,@ 500 @-@ acre ( 71 km2 ) strip of wilderness preserve running northeast @-@ southwest along the Pacific coast . Most of the canyon is covered Laguna Coast Wilderness Park , which is 7 @,@ 000 acres ( 28 km2 ) . It is bordered on the south by Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park , and on its north by Crystal Cove State Park . The parks are managed by the County of Orange and the California Department of Fish and Game , while portions of Laguna Coast are also owned by the City of Laguna Beach . Although there is no trail that follows the main canyon ( as it is traversed by State Route 133 ) , there are many trails , mostly hiking , that lead up narrow side canyons , as well as a trail that circumnavigates Laguna Lakes . Several connecting trails run east @-@ south towards Aliso and Wood Canyons , providing access between the two watersheds . 
 = = History = = 
 Lying to the north of Aliso Canyon , the Laguna Canyon area lay within the tribal boundary of the Tongva , a Native American group whose territory expanded from north @-@ central Orange County well past the San Gabriel River and into the Los Angeles Basin . Aliso Creek , whose watershed borders Laguna Canyon to the east , formed the tribal boundary between the Tongva and Acjachemen . 
 Laguna Canyon Creek was a seasonal stream but the Laguna Lakes , formed by springs arising from a minor fault zone , stayed year round . A Native American path ran through the canyon to the present @-@ day Laguna Beach area , where they fished and collected abalone and limpets . The Tongva lived in villages of 50 @-@ 100 people , in huts made of brushes and tules on a wooden framework . When Spanish explorers arrived in the mid @-@ 18th century , they named the canyon " Cañada de las Lagunas " , referring to the Laguna Lakes . A land grant called La <unk> de San Joaquín occupied the canyon area up to the 19th century . By 1905 , Laguna Beach began to draw municipal water from springs in Laguna Canyon . 
 Before Laguna Canyon became a wilderness park , a housing development was proposed to be built in and around the canyon , tentatively called " Laguna Laurel " . The 2 @,@ 150 @-@ acre ( 8 @.@ 7 km2 ) community , which was proposed to contain 3 @,@ 200 housing units as well as a number of businesses , was canceled in the 1990s after the City of Laguna Beach purchased four of its parcels in order to provide space for a wilderness park , while the City of Irvine purchased one , and Laguna Coast Wilderness Park was opened and dedicated in 1993 . Occasionally , the park system ( which adjoins Aliso / Wood Canyons Regional Park ) is augmented by donations of vacant land . 
 The proposal to stop the development was supported by a crowd of eight to eleven thousand on November 11 , 1989 . This large group gathered in downtown Laguna Beach and marched out to the " The Tell " photographic mural , created by the Laguna Canyon Project , in the Sycamore Hills area of Laguna Canyon . This protest was called the " Walk to Save Laguna Canyon " . Several years later , two to three thousand gathered to protest the construction of California State Route 73 ( which would cross the canyon ) , but the highway was built eventually . 
 In 1993 , a massive wildfire burned over 16 @,@ 000 acres ( 65 km2 ) in Laguna Canyon and Laguna Beach , and ranked behind the 1948 Santa Ana Canyon fire as one of the worst fires in Orange County history . The fire was in part caused by strong Santa Ana Winds , which caused flames that rose up to 200 feet ( 61 m ) high .

 The canyon is one of the last remaining wild areas in Orange County in a strip of preserves along the San Joaquin Hills about 20 miles ( 32 km ) long and 8 miles ( 13 km ) wide . Recently , State Route 133 has been expanded to four lanes from the original two lanes ; the original road is now a one @-@ way southbound . The newly constructed road is mostly parallel to the original road but is closer to Laguna Canyon Creek . Recent construction work at the head of Laguna Canyon near the city of Irvine has leveled some hills on the east side of the canyon , but construction has presently stopped . There are plans to turn the northernmost extreme of the Canyon into a residential development consisting of 590 houses , called Laguna Crossing . It was originally planned to open in 2008 but this date has been moved to 2013 . There also has been work on culverts in the northern part of the canyon . 
 Other parts of Laguna Canyon has been impacted by development , mostly from construction of the state highway but also from buildings in the canyon in the last 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) . Most of the remaining wild lands are now found in the side canyons . Urban runoff has resulted in bacterial pollution downstream at Main Beach in Laguna Beach . There now are several organizations working on preserving the remaining wild lands of the canyon ; Laguna Canyon Foundation is the most prominent one . 
 = Sviatoslav 's invasion of Bulgaria = 
 Sviatoslav 's invasion of Bulgaria refers to a conflict beginning in 967 / 968 and ending in 971 , carried out in the eastern Balkans , and involving the Kievan Rus ' , Bulgaria , and the Byzantine Empire . The Byzantines encouraged the Rus ' ruler Sviatoslav to attack Bulgaria , leading to the defeat of the Bulgarian forces and the occupation of the northern and north @-@ eastern part of the country by the Rus ' for the following two years . The allies then turned against each other , and the ensuing military confrontation ended with a Byzantine victory . The Rus ' withdrew and eastern Bulgaria was incorporated into the Byzantine Empire . 
 In 927 , a peace treaty had been signed between Bulgaria and Byzantium , ending many years of warfare and establishing forty years of peace . Both states prospered during this interlude , but the balance of power gradually shifted in favour of the Byzantines , who made great territorial gains against the Abbasid Caliphate in the East and formed a web of alliances surrounding Bulgaria . By 965 / 966 , the warlike new Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas refused to renew the annual tribute that was part of the peace agreement and declared war on Bulgaria . Preoccupied with his campaigns in the East , Nikephoros resolved to fight the war by proxy and invited the Rus ' ruler Sviatoslav to invade Bulgaria . 
 Sviatoslav 's subsequent campaign greatly exceeded the expectations of the Byzantines , who had regarded him only as a means to exert diplomatic pressure on the Bulgarians . The Rus ' prince conquered the core regions of the Bulgarian state in the northeastern Balkans in 967 – 969 , seized the Bulgarian tsar Boris II , and effectively ruled the country through him . Sviatoslav intended to continue his drive south against Byzantium itself , which in turn regarded the establishment of a new and powerful Russo @-@ Bulgarian state in the Balkans with great concern . After stopping a Rus ' advance through Thrace at the Battle of Arcadiopolis in 970 , the Byzantine emperor John I Tzimiskes led an army north into Bulgaria in 971 and captured Preslav , the capital . After a three @-@ month siege of the fortress of Dorostolon , Sviatoslav agreed to terms with the Byzantines and withdrew from Bulgaria . Tzimiskes formally annexed Eastern Bulgaria to the Byzantine Empire . However , most of the country in the central and western Balkans remained in effect outside imperial control ; this would lead to the revival of the Bulgarian state in these regions under the Cometopuli dynasty . 
 = = Background = = 
 By the beginning of the 10th century , two powers had come to dominate the Balkans : the Byzantine Empire controlled the south of the peninsula and the coasts , and the Bulgarian Empire held the central and northern Balkans . The early decades of the century were dominated by Tsar Simeon ( r . 893 – 927 ) , who expanded his empire at Byzantium 's expense in a series of wars and secured for himself recognition of his imperial title . Simeon 's death in May 927 was soon followed by a rapprochement between the two powers , formalized with a treaty and a marriage alliance later that same year . Simeon 's second son and successor , Peter I ( r . 927 – 969 ) , married Maria , the granddaughter of the Byzantine emperor Romanos I Lekapenos ( r . 920 – 944 ) , and his imperial title was recognized . An annual tribute ( which the Byzantines termed a subsidy for Maria 's upkeep , to save face ) was agreed to be paid to the Bulgarian ruler in exchange for peace . 
 The agreement was kept for almost forty years as peaceful relations suited both sides . Bulgaria , despite the barrier formed by the Danube , was still menaced in its northern reaches by steppe peoples , the Magyars and the Pechenegs . They launched raids throughout Bulgaria , occasionally reaching Byzantine territory as well . The Byzantine – Bulgarian peace nevertheless meant less trouble from the north , as many Pecheneg raids had been sponsored by the Byzantines . Peter 's reign , although lacking the military splendour of Simeon 's , was still a " golden age " for Bulgaria , with a flourishing economy and a thriving urban society . 
 Byzantium used the peace to focus its energy on wars against the Abbasid Caliphate in the East , where a series of campaigns under generals John Kourkouas and Nikephoros Phokas greatly expanded imperial territory . At the same time , military reforms created a much more effective and offensively @-@ oriented army . The Byzantines did not neglect the Balkans , working steadily to improve their contacts with the peoples of central and eastern Europe , subtly altering the balance of power in the peninsula . Their Crimean outpost of Cherson maintained trade with the Pechenegs and the emerging power of the Kievan Rus ' ; Byzantine missionaries led the Christianization of the Magyars ; and the Slavic princes of the western Balkans came to once again acknowledge the suzerainty of the Empire , particularly after <unk> <unk> ended Bulgarian control over Serbia . These relationships on the periphery of the Bulgarian Empire were an important asset for Byzantine diplomacy : instigating attacks against Bulgaria by the Pechenegs and the Khazars was a time @-@ honoured method of applying pressure on the Bulgarians . 
 Upon the sudden death of Emperor Romanos II in 963 , Nikephoros Phokas usurped the throne from Romanos ' infant sons and became senior emperor as Nikephoros II ( r . 963 – 969 ) . Nikephoros , a prominent member of the Anatolian military aristocracy , also focused mostly on the East , leading his army personally in campaigns that recovered Cyprus and Cilicia . Thus things stood when a Bulgarian embassy visited Nikephoros in late 965 or early 966 to collect the tribute owed . Nikephoros , his confidence boosted by his recent successes , and deeming the Bulgarian ruler 's demand presumptuous , refused to pay , claiming that with Empress Maria 's recent death ( ca . 963 ) any such obligations had ceased . He had the envoys beaten and sent them home with threats and insults . He proceeded with his troops to Thrace , where he staged an elaborate parade as a display of military strength and sacked a few Bulgarian border forts . Nikephoros ' decision to effect a breach of relations with Bulgaria was also in response to the recent treaty that Peter I had signed with the Magyars . The treaty stipulated that the Magyars would be allowed to pass through the country and raid Byzantium in exchange for halting their raids in Bulgaria . 
 Anxious to avoid war , Tsar Peter sent his two sons , Boris and Roman , as hostages to Constantinople . This move failed to appease Nikephoros , but he was not able or willing to campaign against Bulgaria ; his forces were engaged in the East , and furthermore , drawing on the Byzantines ' past experience , Nikephoros was reluctant to mount an expedition into the mountainous and heavily forested terrain of Bulgaria . Consequently , he resorted to the old Byzantine expedient of calling in a tribe from eastern Europe to attack Bulgaria . In late 966 or early 967 , he dispatched the patrikios Kalokyros , a citizen of Cherson , as his ambassador to Sviatoslav , ruler of the Rus ' . The Byzantines had long maintained close relations with the Rus ' , with whom they were bound by treaty . With promises of rich rewards and , according to Leo the Deacon , a payment of 1 @,@ 500 pounds of gold , the Rus ' ruler was induced to attack Bulgaria from the north . That Nikephoros should call upon Sviatoslav for aid was unusual , since the Pechenegs were traditionally used for such tasks . The historian A.D. Stokes , who examined the questions surrounding the background and chronology of Sviatoslav 's Bulgarian campaign , suggested that this move had a second motive of turning the attention of Sviatoslav , who had recently destroyed the Khazar khanate , away from the Byzantine outpost of Cherson . 
 Sviatoslav enthusiastically agreed to the Byzantine proposal . In August 967 or 968 , the Rus ' crossed the Danube into Bulgarian territory , defeated a Bulgarian army of 30 @,@ 000 men in the Battle of Silistra , and occupied most of the Dobruja . According to the Bulgarian historian Vasil Zlatarski , Sviatoslav seized 80 towns in northeastern Bulgaria . They were looted and destroyed but not permanently occupied . Tsar Peter I suffered an epileptic stroke when he received news of the defeat . The Rus ' wintered at Pereyaslavets , while the Bulgarians retreated to the fortress of Dorostolon ( Silistra ) . The next year , Sviatoslav left with part of his army to counter a Pecheneg attack on his capital at Kiev ( incited either by the Byzantines or , according to the Russian Primary Chronicle , by the Bulgarians ) . At the same time , Tsar Peter sent a new embassy to Byzantium , a visit that was recorded by Liutprand of Cremona . In contrast to their previous reception , this time the Bulgarian envoys were treated with great honour . Nevertheless , Nikephoros , confident of his position , demanded harsh terms : Tsar Peter was to resign and be replaced by Boris , and the two young emperors , Basil and Constantine , were to be married to Bulgarian princesses , daughters of Boris . 
 Peter retired to a monastery , where he died in 969 , while Boris was released from Byzantine custody and recognized as Tsar Boris II . For the moment , it appeared that Nikephoros ' plan had worked . However , Sviatoslav 's brief sojourn into the south awakened in him the desire to conquer these fertile and rich lands . In this intention he was apparently encouraged by the former Byzantine envoy , Kalokyros , who coveted the imperial crown for himself . Thus , after defeating the Pechenegs , he set up viceroys to rule Russia in his absence and turned his sights southward again . 
 In summer 969 , Sviatoslav returned to Bulgaria in force , accompanied by allied Pecheneg and Magyar contingents . In his absence , Pereyaslavets had been recovered by Boris II ; the Bulgarian defenders put up a determined fight , but Sviatoslav stormed the city . Thereafter Boris and Roman capitulated , and the Rus ' rapidly established control over eastern and northern Bulgaria , placing garrisons in Dorostolon and the Bulgarian capital of Preslav . There Boris continued to reside and exercise nominal authority as Sviatoslav 's vassal . In reality he was little more than a figurehead , retained in order to lessen Bulgarian resentment at and reaction to the Rus ' presence . Sviatoslav appears to have been successful in enlisting Bulgarian support . Bulgarian soldiers joined his army in considerable numbers , tempted partly by the prospects of booty , but also enticed by Sviatoslav 's anti @-@ Byzantine designs and probably mollified by a shared Slavic heritage . The Rus ' ruler himself was careful not to alienate his new subjects : he forbade his army from looting the countryside or plundering cities that surrendered peacefully . 
 Thus Nikephoros ' scheme had backfired : Instead of a weak Bulgaria , a new and warlike nation had been established at the Empire 's northern border , and Sviatoslav showed every intention of continuing his advance south into Byzantium . The emperor tried to get the Bulgarians to resume the war against the Rus ' , but his proposals were not heeded . Then , on 11 December 969 , Nikephoros was murdered in a palace coup and succeeded by John I Tzimiskes ( r . 969 – 976 ) , to whom fell the task of dealing with the situation in the Balkans . The new emperor sent envoys to Sviatoslav , proposing negotiations . The Rus ' ruler demanded a huge sum before he would withdraw , insisting that otherwise the Empire should abandon its European territories to him and withdraw to Asia Minor . For the time being , Tzimiskes was preoccupied with consolidating his position and countering the unrest of the powerful Phokas clan and its adherents in Asia Minor . He therefore entrusted the war in the Balkans to his brother @-@ in @-@ law , the Domestic of the Schools Bardas Skleros , and to the eunuch <unk> Peter . 
 In early 970 , a Rus ' army , with large contingents of Bulgarians , Pechenegs , and Magyars , crossed the Balkan Mountains and headed south . The Rus ' stormed the city of Philippopolis ( now Plovdiv ) , and , according to Leo the Deacon , impaled 20 @,@ 000 of its surviving inhabitants . Skleros , with an army of 10 @,@ 000 – 12 @,@ 000 men , confronted the Rus ' advance near Arcadiopolis ( now <unk> ) in early spring 970 . The Byzantine general , whose army was considerably outnumbered , used a feigned retreat to draw the Pecheneg contingent away from the main army into a prepared ambush . The main Rus ' army panicked and fled , suffering heavy casualties at the hands of the pursuing Byzantines . The Rus ' withdrew north of the Balkan mountain range , which gave Tzimiskes time to deal with internal unrest and to assemble his forces . 
 = = Byzantine offensive = = 
 After being occupied with suppressing the revolt of Bardas Phokas throughout the year 970 , Tzimiskes marshalled his forces in early 971 for a campaign against the Rus ' , moving his troops from Asia to Thrace and gathering supplies and siege equipment . The Byzantine navy accompanied the expedition , tasked with carrying troops to effect a landing in the enemy 's rear and to cut off their retreat across the Danube . The emperor chose Easter week of 971 to make his move , catching the Rus ' completely by surprise : The passes of the Balkan mountains had been left unguarded , either because the Rus ' were busy suppressing Bulgarian revolts or perhaps ( as A.D. Stokes suggests ) because a peace agreement that had been concluded after the battle of Arcadiopolis made them complacent . 
 The Byzantine army , led by Tzimiskes in person and numbering 30 @,@ 000 – 40 @,@ 000 , advanced quickly and reached Preslav unmolested . The Rus ' army was defeated in a battle before the city walls , and the Byzantines proceeded to lay siege . The Rus ' and Bulgarian garrison under the Rus ' noble <unk> put up a determined resistance , but the city was stormed on 13 April . Among the captives were Boris II and his family , who were brought to Constantinople along with the Bulgarian imperial regalia . The main Rus ' force under Sviatoslav withdrew before the imperial army towards Dorostolon on the Danube . As Sviatoslav feared a Bulgarian uprising , he had 300 Bulgarian nobles executed , and imprisoned many others . The imperial army advanced without hindrance ; the Bulgarian garrisons of the various forts and strongholds along the way surrendered peacefully . 
 As the Byzantines neared Dorostolon , they came upon the Rus ' army , which had deployed on a field before the city , ready for battle . After a long and bitter struggle , the Byzantines won the day when Tzimiskes ordered his heavy cataphract cavalry to advance . The Rus ' quickly broke ranks and fled inside the fortress . The subsequent siege of Dorostolon lasted for three months , during which the Byzantines blockaded the city by land and sea and the Rus ' attempted several sallies . Three pitched battles were fought , all of which ended in Byzantine victories . After the final and particularly savage battle in late July , the Rus ' were forced to capitulate . According to Byzantine chroniclers , by that time only 22 @,@ 000 out of an army of originally 60 @,@ 000 remained . Tzimiskes and Sviatoslav met and agreed to a peace treaty : The Rus ' army was allowed to depart , leaving their captives and plunder behind , and their trading rights were re @-@ affirmed in exchange for an oath to never again attack imperial territory . Sviatoslav would not long outlive the peace settlement , as he was slain on his way home in a Pecheneg ambush at the river Dnieper . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The outcome of the war was a complete Byzantine victory , and Tzimiskes decided to take full advantage . Although he initially recognized Boris II as the legitimate Bulgarian tsar , after the fall of Dorostolon his intentions changed . This became evident during his triumphal return to Constantinople , where the emperor entered the Golden Gate behind a wagon carrying an icon of the Virgin Mary as well as the Bulgarian regalia , with Boris and his family following behind Tzimiskes . When the procession reached the Forum of Constantine , Boris was publicly divested of his imperial insignia , and at the church of Hagia Sophia , the Bulgarian crown was dedicated to God . 
 This marked the symbolic end of Bulgaria as an independent state , at least in Byzantine eyes . Byzantine generals were installed in the eastern parts of the country along the Danube . Preslav was renamed <unk> in honour of the emperor , and Dorostolon ( or perhaps Pereyaslavets ) was renamed <unk> after St. Theodore the <unk> , who was believed to have intervened in the final battle before Dorostolon . Tzimiskes reduced the Bulgarian patriarchate to an archbishopric subject to the Patriarch of Constantinople . He brought the Bulgarian royal family and many nobles to live in Constantinople and Asia Minor , while the region around Philippopolis was settled with Armenians . However , outside eastern Bulgaria , and there only in the major urban centres , Byzantine control existed only in theory . Tzimiskes , like Nikephoros Phokas , was more interested in the East . With the Rus ' threat banished and Bulgaria seemingly pacified , his attention turned to Syria . No coordinated Byzantine drive to secure the interior of the Balkans was made . As a result , the north @-@ central Balkans and Macedonia , where neither the Rus ' nor Tzimiskes ' troops had ventured , remained as before in the hands of the local Bulgarian elites . 
 In these areas , a Bulgarian resistance emerged , taking advantage of the Byzantine civil wars after the death of Tzimiskes in 976 , led by the four sons of a count ( comes ) Nicholas , who became known as the Cometopuli ( " sons of the count " ) . The most capable amongst them , Samuel , revived the Bulgarian realm , now centered in Macedonia , and was crowned Tsar in 997 . A formidable warrior , he led raiding campaigns into Byzantine territory as far south as the Peloponnese , and he engaged the Byzantine emperor Basil II ( r . 976 – 1025 ) in a series of wars resulting in the final conquest of the Bulgarian state by the Byzantines in 1018 . Nevertheless , due to the events of 971 , the Byzantines would never regard him as anything other than a rebel against imperial authority , let alone concede the principle of equality enjoyed by the Bulgarian rulers before 971 . 
 = History of cricket to 1725 = 
 The history of cricket to 1725 traces the sport 's development from its perceived origins to the stage where it had become a major sport in England and had been introduced to other countries . 
 The earliest definite reference to cricket occurs in 1598 and makes clear that the sport was being played c . 1550 , but its true origin is a mystery . All that can be said with a fair degree of certainty is that its beginning was earlier than 1550 , somewhere in south @-@ east England within the counties of Kent , Sussex and Surrey . Unlike other games with batsmen , bowlers and fielders , such as stoolball and rounders , cricket can only be played on relatively short grass , especially as the ball was delivered along the ground until the 1760s . Therefore , forest clearings and land where sheep had grazed would have been suitable places to play . 
 The sparse information available about cricket 's early years suggests that it was originally a children 's game . Then , at the beginning of the 17th century , it was taken up by working men . During the reign of Charles I , the gentry took an increased interest as patrons and occasionally as players . A big attraction for them was the opportunity that the game offered for gambling and this escalated in the years following the Restoration . By the time of the Hanoverian succession , investment in cricket had created professional players and first @-@ class clubs , thus establishing the sport as a popular social activity in London and the south of England . Meanwhile , English colonists had introduced cricket to North America and the West Indies , and the sailors and traders of the East India Company had taken it to the Indian subcontinent . 
 = = Origins of cricket as a children 's game = = 
 The most widely accepted theory about the origin of cricket is that it first developed in early medieval times to the south and south @-@ east of London in the geographical areas of the North Downs , the South Downs and the Weald . The counties of Kent , Sussex and Surrey were therefore the earliest centres of excellence and it was from here that the game reached London , where its lasting popularity was ensured , and other southern counties like Berkshire , Essex , Hampshire and Middlesex . As early as 1610 , a cricket match was recorded at <unk> in Kent between teams representing the Downs and the Weald . 
 A number of words in common use at the time are thought to be possible sources for the name " cricket " . In the earliest known reference to the sport in 1598 , it is called creckett . Given the strong medieval trade connections between south @-@ east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy , the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch <unk> ( -e ) , meaning a stick ; or the Olde English <unk> or <unk> meaning a crutch or staff . In what may be an early reference to the sport , a 1533 poem attributed to John Skelton describes Flemish weavers as " kings of <unk> " , a word of apparent Middle Dutch origin . In Samuel Johnson 's Dictionary of the English Language ( 1755 ) , he derived cricket from " <unk> , Saxon , a stick " . In Old French , the word <unk> seems to have meant a kind of club or stick , though this may have been the origin of croquet . Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word <unk> , meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church , the shape of which resembled the two stump wicket used in early cricket . According to Heiner <unk> , a European language expert of the University of Bonn , " cricket " derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey , met de ( krik ket ) sen ( i.e. , " with the stick chase " ) . <unk> believes the sport itself had a Flemish origin but " the jury is still out " on the matter . 
 Cricket was probably devised by children and survived for many generations as essentially a children 's game . Possibly it was derived from bowls , assuming bowls is the older sport , by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball reaching its target by hitting it away . Playing on sheep @-@ grazed land or in clearings , the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep 's wool ( or even a stone or a small lump of wood ) as the ball ; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat ; and a gate ( e.g. , a wicket gate ) , a stool or a tree stump as the wicket . The invention of the game could have happened in Norman or Plantagenet times anytime before 1300 ; or even in Saxon times before 1066 . 
 All acknowledged subject experts and authorities agree that there is no evidence of cricket having evolved from another bat @-@ and @-@ ball sport and , equally , no evidence that any other bat @-@ and @-@ ball sport evolved from cricket . The authorities include writers Harry Altham , John Arlott , Derek Birley , Arthur Haygarth , David Underdown , Roy Webber and Peter Wynne @-@ Thomas . Their consensus view is that the only thing that can definitely be said about the origin of cricket is that its earliest record is in a late 16th @-@ century court case in Surrey which proves it was played by children in southeast England in the middle of that century . There have been alternative theories of origin but these have been dismissed or ignored by authorities . For example , the writer Andrew Lang claimed in 1912 that cricket evolved from a bat @-@ and @-@ ball game which may have been played in Dál Riata as early as the 6th century and this claim has been dismissed in terms of " Lang 's idiosyncratic belief in the Celtic origin of cricket " . It is true that cricket is one of many bat @-@ and @-@ ball sports existing worldwide which have no known origin . Others are the definitely Celtic sports of hurling and shinty . Golf and hockey are other British ball games involving a club or stick while croquet was apparently imported from France and globally there are games such as Sweden 's <unk> , Italy 's <unk> , India 's gilli @-@ danda , Finland 's <unk> and Samoa 's <unk> . However , it is generally believed that cricket essentially belongs to the same family of bat @-@ and @-@ ball games as stoolball , rounders and baseball but whether it evolved from any of these , or vice versa , cannot be determined . There is a 1523 reference to stoolball at a designated field in Oxfordshire ; this may then have been a generic term for any game in which a ball is somehow hit with a bat or stick . 18th century references to stoolball in conjunction with cricket clearly indicate that it was a separate activity . 
 = = = " Creag " = = = 
 On Thursday , 10 March 1300 ( Julian calendar , the Gregorian date would be 19 March 1301 ) , wardrobe accounts of King Edward I of England included refunds to one John de Leek of monies that he had paid out to enable Prince Edward to play " creag and other games " at both Westminster and Newenden . Prince Edward , the future Prince of Wales , was then aged 15 . It has been suggested that " creag " was an early form of cricket . However , creag could have been something quite different . Creag is possibly an early spelling of the word craic , here taken as an Irish word meaning fun , entertainment , or enjoyable conversation . This sense of the word crack is found in Irish English , Scottish English , and Geordie in North East England . In Ireland the spelling craic is now more common than crack . 
 = = = Earliest definite references = = = 
 The earliest definite reference to cricket being played anywhere in England ( and hence anywhere in the world ) is in evidence given at a 1598 court case which confirms that it was played on common land in Guildford , Surrey , around 1550 . The court in Guildford heard on Monday , 17 January 1597 ( Julian date , equating to the year 1598 in the Gregorian calendar ) from a 59 @-@ year @-@ old coroner , John Derrick , who gave witness that when he was a scholar at the " Free School at Guildford " , fifty years earlier , " hee and diverse of his fellows did <unk> and play [ on the common land ] at creckett and other plaies . " 
 In 1598 , there was a reference to cricket in an Italian @-@ English dictionary by Giovanni Florio . His definition of the word <unk> was : " to make a noise as a cricket , to play cricket @-@ a @-@ wicket , and be merry " . Florio is the first writer known to have defined " cricket " in terms of both an insect and a game . In a later edition of his dictionary in 1611 , Florio infers that " to play cricket @-@ a @-@ wicket " has sexual associations with references to <unk> , defined " as we say cricket a wicket , or <unk> " , and <unk> , defined " to thrum a wench lustily till the bed cry <unk> " . 
 = = The development of village cricket : 1611 – 1660 = = 
 = = = Beginning of adult participation = = = 
 In 1611 , a French @-@ English dictionary was published by Randle Cotgrave who defined the noun crosse as " the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket " . The verb form of the word is crosser , defined as " to play at cricket " . Although cricket was defined as a boys ' game in Cotgrave 's dictionary , as per the Guildford schoolboys above , it was at this time that adult participation is known to have begun . 
 The first definite mention of cricket in Sussex was also in 1611 and relates to ecclesiastical court records stating that two parishioners of <unk> in West Sussex had failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket . They were fined 12 pence each and made to do penance . In 1613 , another court case recorded that someone was assaulted with a " cricket staffe " at <unk> , near Guildford . 
 Also in this period , the first definite mention of cricket in Kent is deduced from a 1640 court case which recorded a " cricketing " of " Weald and Upland " versus " <unk> " at <unk> " about thirty years since " ( i.e. , c . 1610 ) . This is the earliest known village cricket match and these contests became popular in the first half of the 17th century . The case concerned the land on which the game was played . 
 In 1617 , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Oliver Cromwell played cricket and football in London . In 1622 , several parishioners of Boxgrove , near Chichester in west Sussex , were prosecuted for playing cricket in a churchyard on Sunday , 5 May . There were three reasons for the prosecution : one was that it contravened a local bye @-@ law ; another reflected concern about church windows which may or may not have been broken ; the third was that a little <unk> had like to have her <unk> beaten out with a cricket batt ! The latter reason was because the rules at the time allowed the batsman to hit the ball twice and so fielding near the batsman was very hazardous , as two later incidents drastically confirm . 
 In 1624 , a fatality occurred at Horsted Keynes in East Sussex when a fielder called Jasper <unk> was struck on the head by the batsman , Edward Tye , who was trying to hit the ball a second time to avoid being caught . <unk> is thus the earliest recorded cricketing fatality . The matter was recorded in a coroner 's court , which returned a verdict of misadventure . The tragedy was repeated in 1647 when another fatality was recorded at Selsey in West Sussex , a player called Henry Brand being hit on the head by a batsman trying to hit the ball a second time . When the first Laws of cricket were encoded in 1744 , it was illegal to hit the ball twice and a batsman breaking the rule was to be given out . The record of the 1624 case confirms that two villages , Horsted Keynes and West <unk> , were involved in the match and provides further evidence of the growth of village cricket . 
 The issue of Sunday play during the years of Puritan influence , from about 1630 to the Restoration in 1660 , has left several references in ecclesiastical court records . These indicate that inter @-@ parish matches were being played but there is nothing to suggest that any teams representative of counties were formed before the Restoration . There is no evidence of large scale gambling or patronage prior to the English Civil War and it was those factors which drove the formation of " representative " teams in the 18th century . It must be concluded , therefore , that the cricket being played before the war was of minor standard only : i.e. , village cricket . 
 Village cricket continued to thrive in the 18th century . In 1717 , Thomas Marchant , a farmer from Hurstpierpoint in Sussex , first mentioned cricket in his diary . He made numerous references to the game , particularly concerning his local club , until 1727 . His son Will played for " our parish " , as he often called the Hurstpierpoint team . 
 = = = Breaking the Sabbath = = = 
 When the English Civil War began in 1642 , the Long Parliament banned theatres , as they had met with Puritan disapproval . Although similar action would be taken against certain sports , there is no evidence of cricket having been prohibited . Except that players must not " break the Sabbath " , references to the game before and during the Commonwealth suggest that it was approved : Cromwell himself had been a player as a young man . It was during the second half of the 17th century that " the game took a real grip " especially in the south @-@ eastern counties . The nobility withdrew to their country estates during the Commonwealth and were involved in village cricket as a pastime which , after the Commonwealth expired in 1660 , they took with them when they returned to London . 
 In 1628 , an ecclesiastical case related to a game at East Lavant , near Chichester in West Sussex , being played on a Sunday . One of the defendants argued that he had not played during evening prayer time but only before and after . It did him no good as he was fined the statutory 12d and ordered to do penance . Doing penance involved confessing his guilt to the whole East Lavant congregation the following Sunday . 
 There are three further references before the Civil War . In a 1636 court case concerning a tithe dispute , a witness called Henry <unk> testified that he played cricket " in the Parke " at West Horsley in Surrey . In 1637 , another ecclesiastical case recorded parishioners of Midhurst , West Sussex , playing cricket during evening prayer on Sunday , 26 February . In 1640 , Puritan clerics at both Maidstone and Harbledown , near Canterbury , denounced cricket as " profane " , especially if played on Sunday . 
 In 1654 , three men were prosecuted at Eltham in Kent for playing cricket on a Sunday . As the Puritans were now firmly in power , Cromwell 's Protectorate having been established the previous year , the penalty was doubled to 24 pence ( two shillings ) . The defendants were charged with " breaking the Sabbath " , not with playing cricket . Similarly , when Cromwell 's commissioners banned sport in Ireland two years later on the grounds of " unlawful assembly " , there is no evidence that the ban included cricket , which had probably not reached Ireland by that time . 
 = = = The beginning of amateur cricket = = = 
 The beginnings of cricket 's social division between amateurs and professionals , from which the annual Gentlemen v Players contest ultimately evolved , can be traced to the reign of Charles I. In 1629 , Henry <unk> , a curate at <unk> in Kent , was prosecuted by an Archdeacon 's Court for playing cricket on Sunday evening after prayers . He claimed that several of his fellow players were " persons of repute and fashion " . This statement is the first evidence of cricket achieving popularity among the gentry . 
 It was the gentry who introduced large @-@ scale gambling into cricket and some of these gamblers subsequently became patrons by forming select teams that would improve their chances of winning . During the Commonwealth , gambling was , of political necessity , low key . The earliest reference to gambling on a cricket match is in the records of a 1646 court case concerning non @-@ payment of a wager that was made on a game at Coxheath in Kent on 29 May that year . Curiously , the wager was for twelve candles , but the participants included members of the local gentry . In 1652 , a case at Cranbrook against John Rabson , Esq. and others referred to " a certain unlawful game called cricket " . Rabson was evidently a member of the gentry but the other defendants were all working class . 
 Cricket has long been recognised as a sport that bridged the class divide but , in time , the cricketing gentlemen came to be called " amateurs " to emphasise the distinction between themselves and the professionals who belonged to the lower social classes , mostly to the working class . The amateur was not merely someone who played cricket in his spare time but a particular type of first @-@ class cricketer who existed officially until 1962 , when the distinction between amateur and professional was abolished and all first @-@ class players became nominally professional . In terms of remuneration , amateurs claimed expenses for playing while professionals were paid a salary or fee . Amateur cricket was an extension of the game played in schools , universities and other centres of education , both as a curricular and extracurricular activity . The schools and universities formed the " production line " that created nearly all the first @-@ class amateur players . 
 There are few 17th century references to cricket being played at or in the vicinity of schools but it was noted at Eton College and Winchester College by the time of the Commonwealth . In 1647 , a Latin poem contains a probable reference to cricket being played at Winchester College ; if so , it is the earliest known mention of cricket in Hampshire . There is a reference to the game at St Paul 's School , London about 1665 concerning John Churchill , 1st Duke of Marlborough , who studied there . In his Social History of English Cricket , Derek Birley comments that school cricket was " alive and well during the interregnum " ( 1649 – 1660 ) . He speculates that the game " must have been known to every schoolboy in the south @-@ east " of England . However , he doubts that the sport at this time was part of any school 's curriculum . Apart from Eton and Westminster School , all schools in the 17th century had local intakes and no class segregation . Therefore , the sons of rich and poor families played together . As evidenced by the legal cases of 1646 and 1652 , described above , cricket was played jointly by gentry and workers . 
 The earliest reference to cricket at Oxford University is dated 1673 . In John Phillips ' <unk> Musicum , a 1673 pamphlet concerning music tuition , there is a criticism of a rival author called Thomas Salmon who had boasted of being a graduate of Trinity College , Oxford : 
 " He shews but a slender sign of his University @-@ Education : Where he seems to have spent his time rather in the more laudable Exercises of Trap and Cricket , than in any sound Reading " . 
 Depending on when Salmon graduated , it would seem that cricket was a normal activity at Oxford for some time before Phillips wrote his pamphlet . Cricket was apparently well established at Oxford by October 1728 when the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Samuel Johnson entered Pembroke College . He told James Boswell that cricket matches were played during the one year he was at Oxford and this was recorded by Boswell in his Life of Samuel Johnson . A comment by Horace Walpole confirms that cricket was being played at Eton College during the first quarter of the 18th century . The earliest reference to cricket being played at Cambridge University was in 1710 and both of these establishments were attended by William Goldwin who , in 1706 , wrote a Latin poem of 95 lines on a rural cricket match . It was called In <unk> <unk> ( On a Ball Game ) and it was published in his <unk> Juveniles . 
 = = Rules and equipment of early cricket = = 
 Early cricketers played in their everyday clothes and had no protective equipment such as gloves or pads . A 1743 painting of a game in progress at the Artillery Ground depicts two batsmen and a bowler dressed alike in white shirt , breeches , white knee @-@ length stockings and shoes with buckles . The wicket @-@ keeper wears the same clothes with the addition of a waistcoat . An umpire and scorer wear three @-@ quarter length coats and <unk> hats . Apart from the shirts and stockings , none of the clothes are white and no one wears pads or gloves . The ball is bowled underarm along the ground , as in bowls , at varying speed towards a wicket consisting of two stumps mounted by a single crosspiece . The batsman addresses the delivery with a bat that resembles a modern hockey stick , this shape being ideal for dealing with a ball on the ground . The modern straight bat evolved in the 1760s after bowlers began to " give the ball air " by pitching it . As a result , " the game changed completely and evolved from its pioneering phase into what may be termed its pre @-@ modern phase " . 
 The record of the 1622 case at Boxgrove contains the earliest reference to the cricket bat . The term " batt " in cricket was peculiar to Kent and Sussex , where coastal smugglers were known as " batmen " because of the cudgels they carried . The earliest reference to a " flat @-@ faced " bat ( i.e. , with a flat surface at the bottom of the stick in ice hockey style ) also occurs in 1622 . The term " bat " remained comparatively rare until about 1720 . The terms in more general use were " staff " , " stave " or " stick " . These tended to have regional usage : for example , " stave " was used in the Gloucester area and " batt " in the south @-@ east ; while " staff " and especially " stick " were more widely used . " Bat " is derived from the French " <unk> " , shaped like a table tennis bat , which was used by washerwomen to beat their washing with . 
 The earliest reference to the cricket ball is found in 1658 in Mysteries of Love and Eloquence by Edward Phillips . The pitch has been 22 yards long ( i.e. , a chain ) since the first known code of laws in 1744 and it is believed this length had been in use since the introduction of Gunter 's chain in 1620 . The over consisted of four deliveries until the 19th century . 
 The earliest known reference to the wicket is contained in lines written in an old bible in 1680 which invited " All you that do delight in Cricket , come to Marden , pitch your wickets " . Marden is in West Sussex , north of Chichester , and close to Hambledon , which is just across the county boundary in Hampshire . The wicket until the 1770s comprised two stumps and a single bail . By that time , the shape of the wicket was high and narrow after the 1744 Laws of cricket defined the dimensions as 22 inches high and six inches wide . But earlier 18th century pictures show a wicket that was low and broad , perhaps two feet wide by one foot high . The ends of the stumps were forked to support the light bail and there were criteria for the firmness of pitching the stumps into the ground and for the delicate placing of the bail so that it would easily topple when a stump was hit . 
 There has been a lot of conjecture about the origin of the wicket , but suffice to say that the 17th century outline shape is more akin to the profile of a church stool , which is low and broad . Furthermore , the legs of the stool were called stumps , which adds further credence to the idea that stools were used as early wickets . According to the <unk> 's Accounts for Great St. Mary 's Church of Cambridge ( 1504 – 1635 ) , a church stool was sometimes known in the south @-@ east by the Dutch name of " <unk> " , this being the same word used for the game by John Derrick in 1597 . 
 There were two main forms of cricket in the 17th and 18th centuries . One was single wicket in which , as the name implies , there is only one batsman , although teams of threes or fives often took part . The converse is the " double wicket " form , with two batsmen , and this has long been associated with eleven @-@ a @-@ side teams playing two innings each . 
 In early cricket , there were two umpires as now , but the modern square @-@ leg umpire stood close to the striker 's wicket . Both umpires carried a bat which the running batsman was required to touch in order to complete his run . There were two scorers who sat on the field and recorded the scores by making notches on <unk> ; runs were then known as notches for this reason . 
 = = The development of first @-@ class cricket : 1660 – 1700 = = 
 The Restoration of the monarchy in England in 1660 was immediately followed by the reopening of the theatres and sanctions imposed by the Puritans on sports were also lifted . Cricket was a leading entertainment and " it was ideal for a wager " . Although there are only scattered references to the game in the time of Charles II , it is clear that its popularity was increasing and that it was expanding . 
 The Restoration was effectively completed during the spring of 1660 and , in the general euphoria which both accompanied and followed these historic events , gambling on cricket and other sports was freely pursued . The large amounts at stake led some investors to try to improve their chances of winning by forming teams that were stronger than the typical parish XI . By now , the nobility had adopted cricket as one of their main sports along with horse racing and prizefighting . This was the beginning of the patronage that sustained and controlled cricket through the 18th century . The first teams representing several parishes and even whole counties were formed in the 1660s and the period saw the first " great matches " as cricket evolved into a major sport . 
 A significant aspect of this evolution was the introduction of professionalism . Members of the nobility who returned to London after the Restoration were keen to develop cricket and brought with them some of the " local experts " from village cricket whom they now employed as professional players . Within a year or two of the Restoration , " it became the thing in London society to make matches and form clubs " . A kind of " feudal patronage " was established as the nobility took control of the sport , their interest fuelled by the opportunities for gambling that it provided , and this set the pattern for cricket 's development through the next century . Consequently , there was a significant rise in standards of play to the level that is now termed " first @-@ class cricket " . 
 The Gaming Act 1664 was passed by the " Cavalier " Parliament to try and curb some of the post @-@ Restoration excesses . It limited stakes to £ 100 which was in any case a fortune at the time , equivalent to about £ 14 thousand in present @-@ day terms . It is known that cricket could attract stakes of 50 guineas by 1697 and it was funded by gambling throughout the next century . 
 The shortage of references in the latter part of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry . Sport , including cricket , was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records , such as court cases , or in private letters and diaries . 
 In May 1666 , Sir Robert Paston of Richmond wrote a letter to his wife mentioning " a game of <unk> ( sic ) on Richmond Green " which is the first reference to cricket at Richmond Green , a popular venue for first @-@ class matches during the 17th and 18th centuries . In 1677 , accounts of Thomas Lennard , 1st Earl of Sussex , include an item which refers to £ 3 being paid to him when he went to a cricket match being played at " ye Dicker " , which was a common near Herstmonceux in East Sussex . In 1671 , a man called Edward Bound was charged with playing cricket on the Sabbath and was exonerated : an indication that attitudes were changing in the wake of the Restoration . The case was reported in Shere , Surrey . In 1694 , accounts of Sir John Pelham record 2s 6d paid for a wager concerning a cricket match at Lewes . 
 Mitcham Cricket Club was formed in 1685 , the club playing on what is today known as Mitcham Cricket Green . The site has hosted cricket matches ever since . Mitcham is believed to be the world 's oldest cricket club as there is no evidence of any club being founded before 1685 . Croydon , Dartford and London had all been founded by the 1720s but their dates of origin have been lost , although there was an actual reference to a London Club in 1722 . 
 London Cricket Club was chiefly associated with the Artillery Ground in Finsbury . This venue was first mentioned in 1725 when the 7 May minutes of the Honourable Artillery Company referred to its being used for cricket : there is a note which concerns " the abuse done to the herbage of the ground by the cricket players " . The Artillery Ground became the feature venue for cricket in the mid @-@ 18th century . 
 In 1695 , Parliament decided against a renewal of the 1662 Licensing Act and so cleared the way for a free press on the Act 's expiry in 1696 . Censorship had already been relaxed following the Bill of Rights 1689 . It was from this time that cricket matters could be reported in the newspapers , but it would be a very long time before the newspaper industry adapted sufficiently to provide frequent , let alone comprehensive , reports . The earliest known newspaper report of a first @-@ class match was in the Foreign Post dated Wednesday , 7 July 1697 : 
 " The middle of last week a great match at cricket was played in Sussex ; there were eleven of a side , and they played for fifty guineas apiece " . 
 The stakes on offer confirm the importance of the fixture and the fact that it was eleven a side suggests that two strong and well @-@ balanced teams were assembled . No other details were given but the report provides real evidence to support the view that " great matches " played for high stakes were in vogue in the years following the Restoration . It was possibly an inter @-@ county match ( i.e. , Sussex versus Kent or Surrey ) and , given the Sussex venue , Charles Lennox , 1st Duke of Richmond may have been one of the patrons involved .

 In 1702 , the Duke of Richmond 's XI defeated an Arundel XI in Sussex . The source for this game is a receipt sent by one Saul Bradley to the Duke on 14 December 1702 . The receipt was in respect of one shilling and six pence paid by the Duke " for brandy when your Grace plaid at Cricket with Arundel men " . It is thought the brandy was bought to celebrate a victory . 
 After the 1st Duke of Richmond died in 1723 , his son Charles Lennox , 2nd Duke of Richmond , quickly succeeded him as cricket 's main benefactor and became a famous patron of Sussex cricket for the next thirty years . The 2nd Duke enjoyed a friendly rivalry with his friend Sir William Gage , another Sussex patron . Their teams played each other many times and their earliest known contest was on Tuesday , 20 July 1725 , five days after Sir William 's team was beaten by unknown opponents . Our knowledge of these two games is based on a humorous letter sent by Sir William to the Duke on 16 July . Sir William bemoaned that he was " shamefully beaten " the previous day in " his first match of the year " but says nothing of his opponents . He then looked forward to playing the Duke 's team next Tuesday and wished his Grace " success in everything except his cricket match " . 
 The main rival to Richmond and Gage was Edwin Stead of Maidstone , who was the first of the noted Kent patrons . The Sussex teams of Richmond and Gage enjoyed an inter @-@ county rivalry with Stead 's Kent that could have originated the concept of the County Championship . 
 = = = The terms of the wager = = = 
 The patrons ensured that cricket was financed in the 18th century but their interest , equally applicable to horse racing and prizefighting , was based on the opportunities that cricket provided for gambling . Every important match in the 18th century , whether eleven @-@ a @-@ side or single wicket , was played for stakes . The early newspapers recognised this and were more interested in publishing the odds than the match scores . Reports would say who won the wager rather than who won the match . Sometimes , gambling would lead to dispute and two matches ended up in court when rival interests sought legal rulings on the terms of their wagers . 
 On Monday , 1 September 1718 , a game on White Conduit Fields in Islington between London and the Rochester Punch Club was unfinished because some of the Rochester players walked off in an attempt to have the game declared incomplete . This was so that they would retain their stake money . London was clearly winning at the time . The game while incomplete became the subject of a lawsuit where the terms of the wager were at issue . The court ordered it to be " played out " and this happened in July 1719 . Rochester with four wickets standing needed thirty more runs to win but lost by 21 and this is cricket 's earliest known definite result . 
 In 1724 , Chingford v Edwin Stead 's XI ended early because the Chingford team refused to play to a finish when Stead 's team had the advantage . A court case followed and , as in 1718 , it was ordered to be played out , presumably so that all wagers could be fulfilled . It is known that Lord Chief Justice Pratt presided over the case and ordered them to play it out on Dartford Brent , though it is unclear if that was the original venue . The game was completed in 1726 . This match is the earliest reference to cricket being played in Essex , assuming Chingford was the original venue , and is the first known to have involved an Essex team . 
 The introduction of articles of agreement , agreed before matches by the stakeholders , largely resolved any problems between patrons and match organisers . The concept was more important in terms of defining the rules of play and eventually these were codified as the Laws of cricket . 
 = = = Matches of the early 18th century = = = 
 Periodicals called The Post Boy and The Post Man were useful sources for cricket advertisements during the early 18th century . In 1700 , a series of matches to be held on Clapham Common was pre @-@ announced on 30 March by The Post Boy . The first was to take place on Easter Monday and prizes of £ 10 and £ 20 were at stake . No match reports could be found so the results and scores remain unknown . The advert says the teams would consist of ten " Gentlemen " per side but the invitation to attend was to " Gentlemen and others " . This clearly implies that cricket had achieved both the patronage that underwrote it through the 18th century and the spectators who demonstrated its lasting popular appeal . On 24 July 1705 , The Post Man announced West of Kent v Chatham , an 11 @-@ a @-@ side game at Malling , Kent . 
 On 1 and 8 July 1707 , Croydon played London twice , the first game played in Croydon , possibly at <unk> Hill , and the second at Lamb 's Conduit Field in Holborn . Both matches were advertised by The Post Man as " two great matches at cricket ( to be ) plaid , between London and Croydon ; the first at Croydon on Tuesday , 1 July , and the other to be plaid in Lamb 's @-@ Conduit @-@ Fields , near Holborn , on the Tuesday following , being the 3rd ( sic ) of July " . No post @-@ match reports could be found so the results and scores are unknown . In the same year , there was a match between London and Mitcham at Lamb 's Conduit Field . 
 The earliest known match that definitely involved county teams , or teams using the names of counties , was Kent v Surrey at Dartford Brent on Wednesday , 29 June 1709 . This was advertised in the Post Man the previous Saturday and played for a stake of £ 50 . Dartford Brent was a popular Kent venue in the 18th century and was probably used for matches in the 17th century . It is likely that Dartford Cricket Club , as the foremost Kent club in this period , provided not only the venue but also the nucleus of the team , while the Surrey team would have been drawn from a number of Surrey parishes and subscribed by their patron . 
 One player who could have taken part in the 1709 match was William <unk> ( 1680 – 1768 ) , of Dartford , who is the earliest great player whose name has been recorded . He was " reckoned to be the most expert player in England " and must have been in his prime <unk> to <unk> Other good players known to have been active in the 1720s were Edwin Stead of Kent ; Edmund Chapman and Stephen <unk> of Surrey ; Tim Coleman of London ; and Thomas <unk> of Sussex . 
 = = = Dartford v London = = = 
 The first great rivalry in cricket history was between the Dartford and London clubs who are first known to have played each other in 1722 . On Wednesday , 19 August 1719 , London v Kent was played at White Conduit Fields and Kent won . The report said the teams played for " a considerable sum of money " . 
 On Saturday , 9 July 1720 , London v Kent at White Conduit Fields was won by London . In this match , two London fielders were badly injured by a clash of heads . H. T. Waghorn wrote that advertising and reporting of cricket ceased for some years after this game and he wondered if that was due to a perception that the sport was dangerous . The South Sea Bubble may have had an economic impact on investment and gambling as , when the South Sea Company was found to be insolvent , its crash in 1720 caused massive repercussions throughout the economy and many formerly prosperous investors were ruined . This could have included cricket patrons , while a potential impact on reporting was the application of stamp duty to newspapers as this increased their publication costs and probably caused publishers to reduce paper size with less room for sports coverage . 
 On Wednesday , 18 July 1722 , London v Dartford in Islington was the subject of a letter in The Weekly Journal dated 21 July 1722 . The result of the match is unknown . In 1723 , the prominent Tory politician Robert Harley , Earl of Oxford recorded in his journal : " At Dartford upon the Heath as we came out of the town , the men of Tonbridge and the Dartford men were warmly engaged at the sport of cricket , which of all the people of England the Kentish folk are the most renowned for , and of all the Kentish men , the men of Dartford lay claim to the greatest excellence " . It is more than likely to have been Dartford Brent where this game was taking place . 
 Dartford and London met at Dartford Brent on Thursday , 11 June 1724 and , one week later , a return game was the earliest known match at Kennington Common , near where The Oval is now sited . The result is unknown . On Monday , 10 August 1724 , there was a match in Islington ( result unknown ) which featured the combined parishes of Penshurst , Tunbridge and Wadhurst versus Dartford . This was recorded in a diary entry by one John Dawson , who may have watched it . No details are known but Mr Dawson says it was " a great cricket match " . 
 = = The growth of cricket in England and overseas = = 
 The earliest known mention of cricket being played outside England is dated Saturday , 6 May 1676 . A diarist called Henry Tonge , who was part of a British mission at Aleppo in the Ottoman Empire ( now in Syria ) , recorded that " at least forty of the English " left the city for recreational purposes and , having found a nice place to pitch a tent for dinner , they " had several pastimes and sports " including " <unk> " . At six they " returned home in good order " . 
 By this time , cricket had been introduced to India , North America and the West Indies but the first definite references occur in the 18th century . In 1709 , cricket was played by William Byrd of Westover on his James River estates in Virginia , then a British colony . This is the earliest reference to cricket being played in the New World . In 1721 , British sailors of the East India Company were reported to be playing cricket at Cambay , near Baroda , and this is the earliest reference to cricket being played in India . It was via the East India Company that cricket was introduced to and established in the Indian sub @-@ continent . There had not yet been any English colonisation of Australasia or southern Africa . 
 It is possible that cricket was introduced to the Americas and India before it had spread throughout the British Isles . For example , there is no record of cricket in Yorkshire , home of the English game 's most successful club , until 1751 . The earliest mentions of cricket in Ireland , Scotland and Wales occur even later in the 18th century . 
 While Britain 's seafaring and trading concerns ensured the spread of cricket overseas , at home it relied heavily on ease of transport and communications , most of these being waterborne as long journeys tended to be undertaken using coastal or river vessels . Road transport was slowly improving and , in 1706 , Parliament established the first turnpike trusts that placed a length of road under the control of trustees drawn from local landowners and traders . The turnpike trusts borrowed capital for road maintenance against the security of tolls . This arrangement became the common method of road maintenance for the next 150 years and came in time to assist the spread of cricket throughout Britain .

Austin Dillon of Richard Childress Racing won the race , while Kyle Larson and Ryan Newman finished second and third , respectively . 
 The qualifying procedure was unique for the race ; drivers ' qualifying times set the starting grids for five heat races to determine the feature race 's starting lineup , while the top five of a last chance qualifier ( LCQ ) advance to the feature . Schrader , Jared Landers , Timothy Peters , Kenny Wallace and Jeb Burton won the heat races , while Brennan Newberry won the LCQ .

 The last race run on dirt in a NASCAR national touring series occurred on September 30 , 1970 at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds in Raleigh in a Grand National ( now Sprint Cup Series ) race , which was won by Richard Petty . Afterwards , NASCAR sanctioned the Busch All @-@ Star Tour , a dirt late model series , which lasted from 1985 to 2002 . 
 Eldora Speedway , which opened in 1954 , is considered to be one of 14 intermediate tracks on the Truck Series schedule , the others being Charlotte , Chicagoland , Dover , Homestead @-@ Miami , Iowa , Kansas , Kentucky , Las Vegas , Michigan , Phoenix , Pocono , Rockingham and Texas . The track is a 0 @.@ 5 mile ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) oval with turns at a 24 degree banking , while the straightaways are 8 degrees . The track 's grandstands can fit 17 @,@ 782 spectators , and the hillside seating can fit an unlimited number of fans . 
 On October 15 , track owner Tony Stewart and Austin Dillon held a private test at the track , driving trucks . On November 28 , 2012 , NASCAR announced that Eldora Speedway would be on the schedule as the first of two Wednesday Truck races , along with the <unk> 200 at Bristol Motor Speedway for 2013 . Although the track does not have any SAFER barriers , Tom Gideon , NASCAR Director of Safety , stated the track meets NASCAR regulations . By January 29 , 2013 , the 17 @,@ 782 grandstand seats had been sold out , with purchasers from 48 states and six countries . 
 " We 've been looking at getting the trucks back to short tracks – to the roots of racing including the dirt – and we ’ re excited to announce our 2013 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series will race at Eldora Speedway in July . The door @-@ to @-@ door racing that our truck series is known for plus Eldora 's popularity and [ Tony Stewart ] ' s dedication to putting on great shows for the fans is a perfect fit . We 'll have a maximum starting field of 30 trucks at Eldora . More details on the race format are still being developed . " 
 Various non @-@ Truck regulars entered the race for reasons such as to help a team in the owners ' championship , with teams hiring drivers who are familiar with dirt racing to assist them in the championship . Examples include dirt track specialists Scott Bloomquist , who won The Dream and the World 100 at the track six times and three times , respectively ; Tracy Hines , who had 85 career wins , including six at Eldora , and 52 starts in the Truck Series ; Jared Landers , who won 100 features in his career ; J.

Jason Bowles was later announced as the driver of the No. 5 for Wauters Motorsports , while Chris Jones was originally listed as the driver of the No. 93 for RSS Racing , but eventually withdrew . 
 In preparation for the race , tire provider Goodyear created new tires , branded " Wrangler " , based on a previous dirt tire that the company made . To give the trucks more grip , the tires were widened by one inch to eleven . The bias @-@ ply tires ( instead of radial tires ) also had treads to remove dirt quicker , in a block pattern , along with being softer . The left @-@ side tires were staggered three inches shorter to 85 @.@ 5 inches than the right tires ( 88 @.@ 5 ) to assist in handling . Meanwhile , the trucks had mesh shields and hood deflector screens attached to prevent debris from the dirt from entering the radiators and damaging the vehicles . The trucks also had the front spoilers and splitters removed , the grille closed , and the rear spoilers raised and enlarged by 40 square inches to generate more downforce . The trucks ' windshields remained , meaning the track crew had to keep the track dry , to prevent mud from making them unable to be cleared . On the hoods , bug deflectors , which were 8 by 12 inches , were installed to prevent stones from hitting the windshield . Teams added under panels to the trucks ' chassis to prevent dirt from increasing the trucks ' weight . 
 Entering the race , Matt Crafton led the points standings with 357 points , followed by Jeb Burton and James Buescher , both with 319 and 317 points , respectively . Ty Dillon and Johnny Sauter finished the top five with 309 and 305 points , respectively . Ryan Blaney had 290 points , and behind him were Miguel <unk> ( 285 ) , Timothy Peters ( 281 ) , Brendan Gaughan ( 280 ) and Darrell Wallace Jr . ( 272 ) .
