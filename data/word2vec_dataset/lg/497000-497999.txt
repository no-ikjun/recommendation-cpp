 = HNoMS Mjølner ( 1868 ) = 
 HNoMS Mjølner was the fourth of five ships of the John Ericsson @-@ class monitors built for the Royal Swedish Navy and the Royal Norwegian Navy in the mid @-@ 1860s . Impressed by the use of ironclads during the American Civil War , the design was based on that of the USS Monitor . They were designed under the supervision of the Swedish @-@ born inventor , John Ericsson — coincidentally , designer of the Monitor — , and built in Sweden . Mjølner was delivered in 1868 and ran aground the following year , although she was not seriously damaged . The ship was reconstructed in 1897 and given modern breech @-@ loading guns . Mjølner was sold for scrap in 1909 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The John Ericsson @-@ class ironclads were designed to meet the need of the Swedish and Norwegian Navies for small , shallow @-@ draft armored ships capable of defending their coastal waters . The standoff between the USS Monitor and the much larger CSS Virginia during the Battle of Hampton Roads in , early 1862 , roused much interest in Sweden in this new type of warship , as it seemed ideal for coastal defense duties . John Ericsson , designer and builder of the Monitor , born in Sweden — although becoming an American citizen in 1848 — offered to share his design with the Swedes . In response , they sent Lieutenant John Christian d 'Ailly to the United States to study monitor design and construction under Ericsson . D 'Ailly arrived in July 1862 and toured rolling mills , gun foundries , and visited several different ironclads under construction . He returned to Sweden in 1863 having completed the drawings of a Monitor @-@ type ship under Ericsson 's supervision . 
 The ship measured 60 @.@ 88 meters ( 199 ft 9 in ) long overall , with a beam of 13 @.@ 54 meters ( 44 ft 5 in ) . She had a draft of 3 @.@ 4 meters ( 11 ft 2 in ) and displaced 1 @,@ 522 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 498 long tons ) . Mjølner was divided into nine main compartments by eight watertight bulkheads . Over time a flying bridge and , later , a full superstructure , was added to each ship between the gun turret and the funnel . Initially her crew numbered 80 officers and men , but this increased to 104 as she was modified with additional weapons . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The John Ericsson @-@ class ships had one twin @-@ cylinder vibrating lever steam engines , designed by Ericsson himself , driving a single four @-@ bladed , 3 @.@ 74 @-@ meter ( 12 ft 3 in ) propeller . Their engines were powered by four fire @-@ tube boilers at a working pressure of 40 psi ( 276 kPa ; 3 kgf / cm2 ) . The engines produced a total of 380 indicated horsepower ( 280 kW ) which gave the monitors a maximum speed of 6 @.@ 5 knots ( 12 @.@ 0 km / h ; 7 @.@ 5 mph ) in calm waters . The ships carried 110 tonnes ( 110 long tons ) of coal , enough for six day 's steaming .

 Mjølner was armed with a pair of Armstrong 270 @-@ millimeter ( 10 @.@ 6 in ) rifled muzzle @-@ loading guns . Each gun was constructed of steel and weighed 18 @.@ 5 long tons ( 18 @.@ 8 t ) . The ship also carried a 80 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) gun . During Mjølner 's reconstruction in 1897 her gun turret was fixed in place and modified to serve as a barbette for her two new breech @-@ loading Cockerill 120 @-@ millimeter ( 5 in ) guns . She also received two 124 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) and 65 @-@ millimeter ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) Cockerill guns mounted in her superstructure . In addition two 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss 5 @-@ barrel revolving guns were mounted in the superstructure . They fired a shell weighing about 1 @.@ 1 lb ( 0 @.@ 50 kg ) at a muzzle velocity of about 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ( 610 m / s ) . This gave them a range of about 3 @,@ 500 yards ( 3 @,@ 200 m ) . They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute

The maximum thickness of the armored deck was 24 @.@ 7 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 0 in ) in two layers . The gun turret 's armor consisted of twelve layers of iron , totalling 270 millimeters ( 10 @.@ 6 in ) in thickness on the first four monitors . The inside of the turret was lined with mattresses to catch splinters . The base of the turret was protected with a 127 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) glacis , 520 millimeters ( 20 @.@ 5 in ) high , and the turret 's roof was 127 millimeters thick . The conning tower was positioned on top of the turret and its sides were ten layers ( 250 millimeters ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) ) thick . The funnel was protected by six layers of armor with a total thickness of 120 millimeters ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) up to half its height .

She was launched in 1868 and completed on 7 September of that year . The ship ran aground at Kragerø on 21 June 1869 . Mjølner could not be pulled off the rocks until the ship 's ammunition , iron ballast and 120 long tons ( 120 t ) of coal were removed . Her repairs were completed on 7 July 1869 by the Royal Dockyard at Horten , at the cost of 5 @,@ 000 krone . The court of inquiry found the ship 's commander and the pilot liable for the repairs , but the parliament released the two from their obligation two years later . She was visited by King Charles XV of Sweden on one occasion when visiting one of Sweden 's west @-@ coast ports in the early 1870s . Mjølner was laid up after her refit in 1897 , but was mobilized during 1905 when the personal union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved . She returned to reserve afterward before being sold for scrap in 1909 .

 Andrew James Alberts ( born June 30 , 1981 ) is an American professional ice hockey defenseman who is currently an Unrestricted Free Agent , having last played for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . He additionally played in the NHL with the Boston Bruins , Philadelphia Flyers and Carolina Hurricanes . A stay @-@ at @-@ home defenseman , he was known for playing a physical style of game . 
 After a two @-@ year junior career in the United States Hockey League ( USHL ) , he was selected by the Bruins 179th overall in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft . Following the draft , he joined the college ranks with the Boston College Eagles of the Hockey East conference . In four seasons with the Eagles , Alberts was named Hockey East 's Best Defensive Defenseman and was a two @-@ time NCAA All @-@ American . Joining the Bruins in 2005 , he played three seasons with the club before being traded to the Flyers . He played with the Flyers for one year , then with the Hurricanes in 2009 . At the trade deadline the following year , he was dealt to the Canucks . Internationally , Alberts has competed for the American national team at the 2006 and 2007 World Championships .

 Alberts played high school hockey for <unk> @-@ St. Margaret 's from 1997 to 1999 . In his graduating year , he earned All @-@ Conference honors while leading the Red Knights to a State Class A title . He played the next two seasons at the junior level in the United States Hockey League ( USHL ) with the Waterloo Blackhawks . Recording 4 points over 49 games in his rookie campaign , he was named the team 's Most Improved Player . In 2000 – 01 , he served as an alternate captain while raising his points total to 14 over 54 games . That summer , Alberts was drafted by the Boston Bruins in the sixth round ( 179th overall ) of the 2001 NHL Entry Draft . 
 Following the draft , Alberts began playing college hockey for Boston College Eagles of the Hockey East conference in 2001 . His first college goal came in the first round of the 2002 <unk> , a short handed marker against the Boston University Terriers . He scored 12 points his freshman year before improving to 22 points in 2002 – 03 . In his third college year , he recorded 16 points was a co @-@ recipient of Hockey East 's Best Defensive Defenseman award with <unk> Ryan of the Maine Black Bears . He was also named to the Hockey East Second All @-@ Star and NCAA East First All @-@ American Teams . 
 Alberts did not miss a game during his college career until suffering two knee injuries during his senior year in 2004 – 05 . Limited to 30 games , he again recorded 16 points and was named to the Hockey East First All @-@ Star Team . In the playoffs , he ended what was the longest semifinal game in Hockey East history with a double @-@ overtime goal against the Maine Black Bears . Alberts earned Hockey East All @-@ Tournament honors , as the Eagles defeated the New Hampshire Wildcats 3 – 1 in the final to win the Lamoriello Trophy as conference champions . He also earned his second consecutive NCAA East All @-@ American recognition . 
 = = = Professional = = = 
 Following his senior year with the Eagles , Alberts signed an amateur tryout contract with the Boston Bruins ' American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate , the Providence Bruins , on April 1 , 2005 . He appeared in the final eight games of the 2004 – 05 AHL regular season before helping the club to the Conference Finals of the playoffs . He scored his first professional goal in Game 5 of the Conference Finals against goaltender Antero <unk> in a 6 – 4 win against the Philadelphia Phantoms . 
 After signing a one @-@ year NHL contract with Boston in August 2005 , he appeared in his first NHL training camp in September 2005 . Making the Bruins ' roster for the 2005 – 06 season , he made his NHL debut on October 5 , 2005 in a game versus the Montreal Canadiens . A month later , he notched his first NHL point , an assist , in a game against the Buffalo Sabres on November 19 . In December 2005 , Alberts received a brief 10 @-@ day assignment to Providence , notching an assist over 6 games during that span . Returning to the Boston lineup , he scored his first NHL goal late in the campaign during a game against the Buffalo Sabres on March 12 , 2006 . Playing in 73 games , Alberts scored a goal and six assists . During his rookie season , Bruins head coach Mike Sullivan experimented with playing Alberts at the forward position for roughly a month . 
 After re @-@ signing for another year in July 2006 , he recorded 10 assists over 76 games the following season . He earned his first multi @-@ year contract in the off @-@ season , re @-@ signing with the Bruins . During the 2007 – 08 season , he was limited to 35 games due to a head injury suffered on November 26 , 2007 , during a game against the Philadelphia Flyers . Going down to his knees to block a puck moving into the defensive zone , opposing forward Scott Hartnell bodychecked him , using his elbow to hit Alberts ' head against the boards . Alberts left the game injured , while Hartnell received a five @-@ minute major penalty and a game misconduct ; he was later suspended an additional two games by the league . Alberts recovered in time to make his NHL playoff debut in April 2008 , as the Bruins were eliminated in the first round by the Montreal Canadiens . 
 After being a healthy scratch for the Bruins ' first two games in the 2008 – 09 season , Alberts was traded to Philadelphia for Ned <unk> and a conditional 2009 draft pick on October 13 , 2008 . The emergence of younger defenceman Matt Hunwick was partly responsible for his expandability . Alberts became an integral part of the Flyers ' defensive corps , leading the team in hits ( 157 ) and ranking third in blocked shots ( 133 ) . His 12 assists and 13 points were career @-@ highs . 
 Becoming an unrestricted free agent in the off @-@ season , Alberts signed a two @-@ year deal with the Carolina Hurricanes on July 16 , 2009 . The contract paid him $ 800 @,@ 000 the first year and $ 1 @.@ 3 million the second . After appearing in 62 games for Carolina , he was dealt at the 2009 – 10 trade deadline on March 3 , 2010 , to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for a third round pick in the 2010 draft ( Austin Levi ) . Between Carolina and Vancouver , Alberts finished the regular season with 3 goals and 12 points over 76 games . His defensive play struggled in his initial stint with Vancouver , often being made a healthy scratch . He continued to earn criticism from Vancouver fans and media in the playoffs , particularly for his lack of speed and for taking costly penalties . 
 Alberts came back to the Canucks with improved play during the 2010 pre @-@ season and beat out Shane O 'Brien for the team 's final spot on defense ( O 'Brien was subsequently traded prior to the start of the season ) . Nearly a month into the season , Alberts suffered a minor knee injury during a game against the Colorado Avalanche , but did not miss any games . Later in the season , he was sucker @-@ punched in the face by enforcer Jody Shelley during a game against the Flyers in December 2010 . The two were being restrained by referees during a scrum when Shelley struck him . As a result , he received a two @-@ game suspension from the league and forfeited $ 26 @,@ 829 @.@ 27 in salary . Though Alberts left the game , he was not injured on the play . The following month , Alberts suffered a right shoulder injury during a game against the Minnesota Wild on January 16 , 2011 . Shortly after recovering and returning to the lineup , he suffered another injury , breaking his wrist while blocking a shot during a game against the St. Louis Blues on February 14 , 2011 . He missed the remainder of the regular season , finishing with a goal and seven assists , while leading Canucks defencemen with 113 hits , over 42 games . Recovering in time for the playoffs , Alberts appeared in nine post @-@ season games ( he did not register any points ) during the Canucks ' run to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals , where they were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins . During the off @-@ season , Alberts was re @-@ signed by the Canucks to a two @-@ year , $ 2 @.@ 45 million deal on June 29 , 2011 ( two days prior to his pending unrestricted free agency ) . 
 During the 2013 off @-@ season , the Canucks signed Alberts to a one @-@ year extension . Alberts suffered a concussion during a December 29 , 2013 game against the Calgary Flames due to a high hit delivered by enforcer Brian McGrattan that sidelined him for the remainder of the Canucks ' season and has placed his career in doubt .

 According to SIMBAD , WASP @-@ 13 was first observed in 1997 , when it was catalogued by astronomers measuring the proper motion of stars in regions of the sky where galaxies are detected . Between November 27 , 2006 , and April 1 , 2007 , the SuperWASP @-@ North telescope in the Canary Islands observed WASP @-@ 13 ; analysis of the data suggested that a planet could be in the orbit of the star . 
 Follow @-@ up observations were conducted by a team of British , Spanish , French , Swiss and American astronomers using the photometer on the James Gregory Telescope in Scotland ; using visual comparisons to the nearby bright star HD <unk> , the star 's light curve was better defined . In combination with measurements of WASP @-@ 13 's spectrum measured using the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at the Haute @-@ Provence Observatory in France , the star 's radial velocity was also discovered . The Fibre @-@ Fed Echelle Spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope gathered additional measurements of WASP @-@ 13 's spectrum , allowing astronomers to determine WASP @-@ 13 's characteristics . Use of SOPHIE 's data led to the discovery of the planet WASP @-@ 13b in 2008 ; the planet was reported in 2009 . 
 Based on SIMBAD 's archive , WASP @-@ 13 was included in ten more papers between its discovery and 2010 .

 WASP @-@ 13 is a sunlike , G @-@ type star that is situated approximately 156 parsecs ( 509 light years ) in the Lynx constellation . With an apparent magnitude of 10 @.@ 42 , the star cannot be seen with the unaided eye from the perspective of someone on Earth . The star 's effective temperature , at <unk> K , is hotter than that of the Sun . However , its metallicity is similar ; this can be seen in how the concentration of iron , or [ Fe / H ] , is approximately 0 . WASP @-@ 13 's surface gravity is measured at 4 @.@ 04 km / s2 , while the rate at which it rotates is at most 4 @.@ 9 km / s . 
 WASP @-@ 13 has a mass that is 1 @.@ 03 times the mass of the Sun and a radius that is 1 @.@ 34 times the Sun 's radius . Measurements of its lithium content suggest that the star has used up all of its helium and is now fusing lithium in the shell around its core . With this , its estimated age is 8 @.@ 5 billion years , over twice the age of the Sun , but this age may vary to any point between 4 @.@ 4 and 14 billion years in age because of the high uncertainty surrounding this aspect of the star 's age .

 = Oort cloud = 
 The Oort cloud ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / , named after the astronomer Jan Oort ) , sometimes called the Öpik – Oort cloud , is a theoretical cloud of predominantly icy planetesimals believed to surround the Sun to as far as somewhere between 50 @,@ 000 and 200 @,@ 000 AU ( 0 @.@ 8 and 3 @.@ 2 ly ) . It is divided into two regions : a disc @-@ shaped inner Oort cloud ( or Hills cloud ) and a spherical outer Oort cloud . Both regions lie beyond the heliosphere and in interstellar space . The Kuiper belt and the scattered disc , the other two reservoirs of trans @-@ Neptunian objects , are less than one thousandth as far from the Sun as the Oort cloud . 
 The outer limit of the Oort cloud defines the <unk> boundary of the Solar System and the extent of the Sun 's Hill sphere . The outer Oort cloud is only loosely bound to the Solar System , and thus is easily affected by the gravitational pull both of passing stars and of the Milky Way itself . These forces occasionally dislodge comets from their orbits within the cloud and send them toward the inner Solar System . Based on their orbits , most of the short @-@ period comets may come from the scattered disc , but some may still have originated from the Oort cloud . 
 Astronomers conjecture that the matter composing the Oort cloud formed closer to the Sun and was scattered far into space by the gravitational effects of the giant planets early in the Solar System 's evolution . Although no confirmed direct observations of the Oort cloud have been made , it may be the source of all long @-@ period and Halley @-@ type comets entering the inner Solar System , and many of the centaurs and Jupiter @-@ family comets as well . 
 = = Hypothesis = = 
 In 1932 , the Estonian astronomer Ernst Öpik postulated that long @-@ period comets originated in an orbiting cloud at the outermost edge of the Solar System . The idea was independently revived by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort as a means to resolve a paradox . Over the course of the Solar System 's existence the orbits of comets are unstable and eventually dynamics dictate that a comet must either collide with the Sun or a planet or else be ejected from the Solar System by planetary perturbations . Moreover , their volatile composition means that as they repeatedly approach the Sun , radiation gradually boils the volatiles off until the comet splits or develops an insulating crust that prevents further outgassing . Thus , Oort reasoned , a comet could not have formed while in its current orbit and must have been held in an outer reservoir for almost all of its existence . 
 There are two main classes of comet , short @-@ period comets ( also called ecliptic comets ) and long @-@ period comets ( also called nearly isotropic comets ) . Ecliptic comets have relatively small orbits , below 10 AU , and follow the ecliptic plane , the same plane in which the planets lie . All long @-@ period comets have very large orbits , on the order of thousands of AU , and appear from every direction in the sky . Oort noted that there was a peak in numbers of long @-@ period comets with aphelia ( their farthest distance from the Sun ) of roughly 20 @,@ 000 AU , which suggested a reservoir at that distance with a spherical , isotropic distribution . Those relatively rare comets with orbits of about 10 @,@ 000 AU have probably gone through one or more orbits through the Solar System and have had their orbits drawn inward by the gravity of the planets . 
 = = Structure and composition = = 
 The Oort cloud is thought to occupy a vast space from somewhere between 2 @,@ 000 and 5 @,@ 000 AU ( 0 @.@ 03 and 0 @.@ 08 ly ) to as far as 50 @,@ 000 AU ( 0 @.@ 79 ly ) from the Sun . Some estimates place the outer edge at between 100 @,@ 000 and 200 @,@ 000 AU ( 1 @.@ 58 and 3 @.@ 16 ly ) . The region can be subdivided into a spherical outer Oort cloud of 20 @,@ 000 – 50 @,@ 000 AU ( 0 @.@ 32 – 0 @.@ 79 ly ) , and a torus @-@ shaped inner Oort cloud of 2 @,@ 000 – 20 @,@ 000 AU ( 0 @.@ 0 – 0 @.@ 3 ly ) . The outer cloud is only weakly bound to the Sun and supplies the long @-@ period ( and possibly Halley @-@ type ) comets to inside the orbit of Neptune . The inner Oort cloud is also known as the Hills cloud , named after Jack G. Hills , who proposed its existence in 1981 . Models predict that the inner cloud should have tens or hundreds of times as many cometary nuclei as the outer halo ; it is seen as a possible source of new comets to resupply the tenuous outer cloud as the latter 's numbers are gradually depleted . The Hills cloud explains the continued existence of the Oort cloud after billions of years . 
 The outer Oort cloud may have trillions of objects larger than 1 km ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) , and billions with absolute magnitudes brighter than 11 ( corresponding to approximately 20 @-@ kilometre ( 12 mi ) diameter ) , with neighboring objects tens of millions of kilometres apart . Its total mass is not known , but , assuming that Halley 's Comet is a suitable prototype for comets within the outer Oort cloud , roughly the combined mass is 3 × 1025 kilograms ( 6 @.@ 6 × 1025 lb ) , or five times that of Earth . Earlier it was thought to be more massive ( up to 380 Earth masses ) , but improved knowledge of the size distribution of long @-@ period comets led to lower estimates . The mass of the inner Oort cloud has not been characterized . 
 If analyses of comets are representative of the whole , the vast majority of Oort @-@ cloud objects consist of ices such as water , methane , ethane , carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide . However , the discovery of the object 1996 PW , an object whose appearance was consistent with a D @-@ type asteroid in an orbit typical of a long @-@ period comet , prompted theoretical research that suggests that the Oort cloud population consists of roughly one to two percent asteroids . Analysis of the carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in both the long @-@ period and Jupiter @-@ family comets shows little difference between the two , despite their presumably vastly separate regions of origin . This suggests that both originated from the original protosolar cloud , a conclusion also supported by studies of granular size in Oort @-@ cloud comets and by the recent impact study of Jupiter @-@ family comet Tempel 1 . 
 = = Origin = = 
 The Oort cloud is thought to be a remnant of the original protoplanetary disc that formed around the Sun approximately 4 @.@ 6 billion years ago . The most widely accepted hypothesis is that the Oort cloud 's objects initially coalesced much closer to the Sun as part of the same process that formed the planets and minor planets , but that gravitational interaction with young gas giants such as Jupiter ejected the objects into extremely long elliptic or parabolic orbits . Recent research has been cited by NASA hypothesizing that a large number of Oort cloud objects are the product of an exchange of materials between the Sun and its sibling stars as they formed and drifted apart , and it is suggested that many — possibly the majority of — Oort cloud objects did not form in close proximity to the Sun . Simulations of the evolution of the Oort cloud from the beginnings of the Solar System to the present suggest that the cloud 's mass peaked around 800 million years after formation , as the pace of accretion and collision slowed and depletion began to overtake supply . 
 Models by Julio Ángel Fernández suggest that the scattered disc , which is the main source for periodic comets in the Solar System , might also be the primary source for Oort cloud objects . According to the models , about half of the objects scattered travel outward toward the Oort cloud , whereas a quarter are shifted inward to Jupiter 's orbit , and a quarter are ejected on hyperbolic orbits . The scattered disc might still be supplying the Oort cloud with material . A third of the scattered disc 's population is likely to end up in the Oort cloud after 2 @.@ 5 billion years . 
 Computer models suggest that collisions of cometary debris during the formation period play a far greater role than was previously thought . According to these models , the number of collisions early in the Solar System 's history was so great that most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud . Therefore , the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected . The estimated mass of the cloud is only a small part of the 50 – 100 Earth masses of ejected material . 
 Gravitational interaction with nearby stars and galactic tides modified cometary orbits to make them more circular . This explains the nearly spherical shape of the outer Oort cloud . On the other hand , the Hills cloud , which is bound more strongly to the Sun , has not acquired a spherical shape . Recent studies have shown that the formation of the Oort cloud is broadly compatible with the hypothesis that the Solar System formed as part of an embedded cluster of 200 – 400 stars . These early stars likely played a role in the cloud 's formation , since the number of close stellar passages within the cluster was much higher than today , leading to far more frequent perturbations . 
 In June 2010 Harold F. Levison and others suggested on the basis of enhanced computer simulations that the Sun " captured comets from other stars while it was in its birth cluster " . Their results imply that " a substantial fraction of the Oort cloud comets , perhaps exceeding 90 % , are from the protoplanetary discs of other stars " .

Short @-@ period comets ( those with orbits of up to 200 years ) are generally accepted to have emerged from either the Kuiper belt or the scattered disc , which are two linked flat discs of icy debris beyond Neptune 's orbit at 30 AU and jointly extending out beyond 100 AU from the Sun . Long @-@ period comets , such as comet Hale – Bopp , whose orbits last for thousands of years , are thought to originate in the Oort cloud . The orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable , and so very few comets are thought to originate there . The scattered disc , however , is dynamically active , and is far more likely to be the place of origin for comets . Comets pass from the scattered disc into the realm of the outer planets , becoming what are known as centaurs . These centaurs are then sent farther inward to become the short @-@ period comets . 
 There are two main varieties of short @-@ period comet : Jupiter @-@ family comets ( those with semi @-@ major axes of less than 5 AU ) and Halley @-@ family comets . Halley @-@ family comets , named for their prototype , Halley 's Comet , are unusual in that although they are short @-@ period comets , it is hypothesized that their ultimate origin lies in the Oort cloud , not in the scattered disc . Based on their orbits , it is suggested they were long @-@ period comets that were captured by the gravity of the giant planets and sent into the inner Solar System . This process may have also created the present orbits of a significant fraction of the Jupiter @-@ family comets , although the majority of such comets are thought to have originated in the scattered disc . 
 Oort noted that the number of returning comets was far less than his model predicted , and this issue , known as " cometary fading " , has yet to be resolved . No known dynamical process can explain this undercount of observed comets . Hypotheses for this discrepancy include the destruction of comets due to tidal stresses , impact or heating ; the loss of all volatiles , rendering some comets invisible , or the formation of a non @-@ volatile crust on the surface . Dynamical studies of Oort cloud comets have shown that their occurrence in the outer @-@ planet region is several times higher than in the inner @-@ planet region . This discrepancy may be due to the gravitational attraction of Jupiter , which acts as a kind of barrier , trapping incoming comets and causing them to collide with it , just as it did with Comet Shoemaker – Levy 9 in 1994 . 
 = = Tidal effects = = 
 Most of the comets seen close to the Sun seem to have reached their current positions through gravitational perturbation of the Oort cloud by the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way . Just as the Moon 's tidal force deforms Earth 's oceans , causing the tides to rise and fall , the galactic tide also distorts the orbits of bodies in the outer Solar System . In the charted regions of the Solar System , these effects are negligible compared to the gravity of the Sun , but in the outer reaches of the system , the Sun 's gravity is weaker and the gradient of the Milky Way 's gravitational field has substantial effects . Galactic tidal forces stretch the cloud along an axis directed toward the galactic centre and compress it along the other two axes ; these small perturbations can shift orbits in the Oort cloud to bring objects close to the Sun . The point at which the Sun 's gravity concedes its influence to the galactic tide is called the tidal truncation radius . It lies at a radius of 100 @,@ 000 to 200 @,@ 000 AU , and marks the outer boundary of the Oort cloud . 
 Some scholars theorise that the galactic tide may have contributed to the formation of the Oort cloud by increasing the perihelia ( smallest distances to the Sun ) of planetesimals with large aphelia ( largest distances to the Sun ) . The effects of the galactic tide are quite complex , and depend heavily on the behaviour of individual objects within a planetary system . Cumulatively , however , the effect can be quite significant : up to 90 % of all comets originating from the Oort cloud may be the result of the galactic tide . Statistical models of the observed orbits of long @-@ period comets argue that the galactic tide is the principal means by which their orbits are perturbed toward the inner Solar System . 
 = = Stellar perturbations and stellar companion hypotheses = = 
 Besides the galactic tide , the main trigger for sending comets into the inner Solar System is thought to be interaction between the Sun 's Oort cloud and the gravitational fields of nearby stars or giant molecular clouds . The orbit of the Sun through the plane of the Milky Way sometimes brings it in relatively close proximity to other stellar systems . For example , 70 thousand years ago , Scholz 's star passed through the outer Oort cloud ( although its low mass and high relative velocity limited its effect ) . During the next 10 million years the known star with the greatest possibility of perturbing the Oort cloud is Gliese 710 . This process also scatters Oort cloud objects out of the ecliptic plane , potentially also explaining its spherical distribution . 
 In 1984 , Physicist Richard A. Muller postulated that the Sun has a heretofore undetected companion , either a brown dwarf or a red dwarf , in an elliptical orbit within the Oort cloud . This object , known as Nemesis , was hypothesized to pass through a portion of the Oort cloud approximately every 26 million years , bombarding the inner Solar System with comets . However , to date no evidence of Nemesis has been found , and many lines of evidence ( such as crater counts ) , have thrown its existence into doubt . Recent scientific analysis no longer supports the idea that extinctions on Earth happen at regular , repeating intervals . Thus , the Nemesis hypothesis is no longer needed . 
 A somewhat similar hypothesis was advanced by astronomer John J. Matese of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2002 . He contends that more comets are arriving in the inner Solar System from a particular region of the Oort cloud than can be explained by the galactic tide or stellar perturbations alone , and that the most likely cause is a Jupiter @-@ mass object in a distant orbit . This hypothetical gas giant was nicknamed Tyche . The WISE mission , an all @-@ sky survey using parallax measurements in order to clarify local star distances , was capable of proving or disproving the Tyche hypothesis . In 2014 , NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object as they had defined it . 
 = = Modified Newtonian dynamics within the Oort cloud = = 
 Modified Newtonian dynamics ( MOND ) suggests that at their distances from the Sun , the objects comprising the Oort cloud should experience accelerations of the order of 10 − 10 m / s2 , and thus should be within the realms at which deviations from Newtonian predictions come into effect . According to this hypothesis , which was proposed to account for the discrepancies in the galaxy rotation curve , which are more commonly attributed to dark matter , acceleration ceases to be linearly proportional to force at very low accelerations . If correct , this would have significant implications regarding the formation and structure of the Oort cloud . However , the majority of cosmologists do not consider MOND a valid hypothesis because it is unable to explain the movement of galactic clusters or account accurately for the cosmic microwave background . 
 = = Future exploration = = 
 Space probes have yet to reach the area of the Oort cloud . Voyager 1 , the fastest and farthest of the interplanetary space probes currently leaving the Solar System , will reach the Oort cloud in about 300 years and would take about 30 @,@ 000 years to pass through it . However , around 2025 , the radioisotope thermoelectric generators on Voyager 1 will no longer supply enough power to operate any of its scientific instruments , preventing any exploration by Voyager 1 . The other four probes currently escaping the Solar System either are already or are predicted to be non @-@ functional when they reach the Oort cloud ; however , it may be possible to find an object from the cloud that has been knocked into the inner Solar System . 
 In the 1980s there was a concept for a probe to reach 1 @,@ 000 AU in 50 years called <unk> ; among its missions would be to look for the Oort cloud . 
 In the 2014 Announcement of Opportunity for the Discovery program , an observatory to detect the objects in the Oort cloud ( and Kuiper belt ) called the " The Whipple Mission " was proposed . It would monitor distant stars with a photometer , looking for transits up to 10 thousand AU away . The observatory was proposed for halo orbiting around L2 with a suggested 5 @-@ year mission . It has been suggested that the Kepler observatory may also be able to detect objects in the Oort cloud . 
 = Michael Lachanodrakon = 
 Michael Lachanodrakon ( Greek : Μιχαήλ <unk> ; died 20 July 792 ) was a distinguished Byzantine general and fanatical supporter of Byzantine Iconoclasm under Emperor Constantine V ( r . 741 – 775 ) . As a result of his iconoclast zeal , in 766 he rose to high office as governor of the Thracesian Theme , and instigated a series of repressive measures against iconophile practices , particularly targeting the monasteries . A talented general , he also led a series of campaigns against the Arabs of the Abbasid Caliphate before being dismissed from office in about 782 . Restored to imperial favour in 790 , he fell at the Battle of Marcellae against the Bulgars in 792 . 
 = = Persecution of the iconophiles = = 
 Nothing is known of Lachanodrakon 's origins and early life . He receives a very negative treatment in the historical sources , which were written after the final defeat of Byzantine Iconoclasm ; some refer to him solely as ho Drakon ( ὁ <unk> , " the Dragon " , alluding to his surname and the Biblical Beast ) . Their profoundly iconophile perspective means that reports of his actions , especially those relating to the suppression of icon worship , are potentially untrustworthy . 
 At the Council of <unk> in 754 , Constantine V had declared the adoration of icons to be a heresy , and had thereby elevated iconoclasm to official imperial policy . No persecution of iconophiles was launched at first , but iconophile resistance grew , until from 765 on , Constantine began persecuting iconophiles , and especially monks . The discovery of a wide @-@ ranging iconophile plot against him involving some of the highest civil and military officials of the state in 766 provoked an extreme reaction . Patriarch Constantine II and other officials were deposed , jailed , publicly humiliated , and finally executed , replaced by new , uncompromisingly iconoclast officials . In addition , the veneration of sacred relics and prayers to the saints and the Virgin Mary were condemned . 
 By 763 or 764 , according to the iconophile Life of St Stephen the Younger hagiography , Lachanodrakon had already distinguished himself by his iconoclast fervour . On the emperor 's orders , he led a group of soldiers on an invasion of the <unk> monastery on the Propontis , where he arrested 38 monks and subjected the remainder to various tortures and mutilations . After burning down the monastery , he took the 38 captives to Ephesus , where they were executed . In 766 / 767 , as part of the emperor 's reshuffle of the senior echelons of the Byzantine Empire , Lachanodrakon was rewarded with the important post of strategos ( military governor ) of the Thracesian Theme , and given the rank of patrikios and imperial protospatharios according to his seal . He soon began a harsh repression of the monasteries and iconophiles . According to Theophanes the Confessor , in 769 / 770 he summoned the monks and nuns of his theme to Ephesus , gathered them in the city 's <unk> and forced them to marry , threatening them with blinding and exile to Cyprus if they refused . Although many resisted and " became martyrs " in Theophanes 's words , many complied . Later reports of exiled monks in Cyprus becoming Arab captives seem to partly corroborate this story . Theophanes reports further that in 771 / 772 , Lachanodrakon dissolved all monasteries in the theme , confiscated and expropriated their property , and sent the proceeds to the emperor , who replied with a letter thanking him for his zeal . Lachanodrakon allegedly had relics , holy scriptures , and monks ' beards set on fire , killed or tortured those who venerated relics , and finally prohibited the tonsure . Although highly embellished , these reports probably reflect actual events . At any rate , by 772 , according to historian Warren Treadgold , Lachanodrakon seems to have succeeded in " eradicating monasticism within his theme " . 
 = = Military activities = = 
 Lachanodrakon was also a capable general , winning fame for his campaigns against the Abbasids on the Byzantine Empire 's eastern frontier . During the reign of Constantine V 's son Leo IV ( r . 775 – 780 ) he seems to have been the most prominent military commander , repeatedly leading expeditions comprising troops from several themes against the Arabs . 
 The first such expedition occurred in 778 when , preempting an anticipated Arab raid , Lachanodrakon led a large army against Germanikeia . Although the city did not fall ( Theophanes claims that the Arab commander bribed Lachanodrakon ) , the Byzantine army defeated a relief force , plundered the region , and took many captives , mostly Jacobites , who were then resettled in Thrace . In 780 , Lachanodrakon ambushed and defeated an Arab invasion in the Armeniac Theme , killing the brother of the Arab commander Thumama ibn al @-@ Walid . The Arab historian al @-@ Tabari records that in 781 Lachanodrakon forced another Arab invasion , under ' Abd al @-@ Kabir , to withdraw without battle , although Theophanes ascribes the success to the sakellarios John . In 782 , however , he was defeated by the Arab general al @-@ <unk> during a large @-@ scale invasion led by the future caliph Harun al @-@ Rashid ( r . 786 – 809 ) , losing some 15 @,@ 000 men according to Theophanes . In the aftermath of this defeat , and likely because of his iconoclast past , he was apparently removed from his command by the iconophile empress @-@ regent Irene of Athens . 
 Lachanodrakon reappears in 790 , when the young emperor Constantine VI ( r . 780 – 797 ) conspired to overturn the tutelage of Irene . The general was sent by Constantine to the Armeniac Theme to secure the allegiance of its soldiers . Constantine succeeded in toppling his mother in December 790 ; it was probably then that Lachanodrakon was rewarded with the supreme non @-@ imperial title , that of magistros . According to the account of Theophanes , he participated in the imperial campaign against the Bulgars in 792 that led to the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Marcellae on 20 July , where he was killed . The history of John Skylitzes records his death in the Battle of <unk> , again against the Bulgars , in 813 , but this is clearly an error . 
 = House of Music = 
 House of Music is the fourth studio album by American R & B group Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! , released on November 19 , 1996 , by Mercury Records . It is the follow @-@ up to their critically and commercially successful 1993 album Sons of Soul . Recording sessions for the album took place at several recording studios in San Francisco , Los Angeles , Oakland , and Sacramento during 1995 to 1996 , with production handled primarily by the group members . The album was named after a record store in the group 's native Oakland . 
 Following their hiatus as a group , Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! members Raphael Saadiq , D 'wayne Wiggins , and Timothy Christian Riley worked on songs for the album independently before putting together their finished recordings . Collectively , they sought to emphasize musicianship rather than production technique during the sessions . House of Music expands on their previous work 's traditional R & B influences with live instrumentation and balladry . Music writers have noted the album for its incorporation of traditional and contemporary musical styles , themes of love and romance , and witty , sensitive lyrics . 
 House of Music reached number 32 on the Billboard 200 , on which it charted for 31 weeks . It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . The record received widespread acclaim from critics , who praised its musical style , classic influences , and the group 's musicianship and songwriting . An expected international tour in support of the album did not materialize , and House of Music proved to be the group 's last album together , as they subsequently disbanded due to creative differences and pursued separate music careers .

 Following the commercial and critical success of their 1993 album Sons of Soul , Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! took a hiatus as a group . During their break , the group 's main members Raphael Wiggins , D 'wayne Wiggins , and Timothy Christian Riley worked on songwriting and production for other recording artists , including D 'Angelo , En Vogue , Karyn White , Tevin Campbell , and A Tribe Called Quest . Raphael Wiggins adopted the surname Saadiq for his professional name in 1994 , meaning " man of his word " in Arabic , and released his solo single " Ask of You " in 1995 . Their work outside the group led to rumors of a break @-@ up during the time between albums . House of Music was titled after the name of a record store in the group 's native Oakland , California , which had closed several years prior to the album 's release . In an interview for Billboard , D 'wayne Wiggins said of naming the album , " We title all our albums at the end of the project . We sat back and listened to everything , and it reminded us of this mom @-@ and @-@ pop store around our way in Oakland . " The album 's cover and booklet photos were taken by photographer William Claxton . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Recording sessions for the album took place during September 1995 to September 1996 at various recording studios in California , including <unk> Studios and Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco , Coda Studios and Grass Roots Studios in Oakland , Encore Studios , Image Recording , and Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles , and Pookie Labs and <unk> Studios in Sacramento . The group used vintage recording equipment and , for certain tracks , a 40 @-@ piece orchestra . In contrast to their previous work , each member arranged , composed , and produced songs on their own before putting the finished recordings together . In a 1997 interview , Saadiq said of working independently of Wiggins and Riley , " What I did was write a lot of stuff and rehearse it for about a month , then recorded it live . Then they would add their parts separately . " He worked with his own recording crew , comprising guitarist Chalmers " Spanky " Alford , drummer Tommy Branford , and keyboardists Kelvin Wooten and Cedric Draper . 
 The album 's opening track , " Thinking of You " , is one song that the group conceived and recorded together . D 'wayne Wiggins recounted its recording in a 1996 interview for USA Today , stating " Usually the first track we start off with sets the pace . We did it at 3 in the morning in Ray 's studio in Sacramento , and we were just having fun with an Al Green vibe . " Saadiq later said of developing the song , " I was just playing around and started singing off the top of my head . I never wrote anything down , it was just what came out . " " Annie May " , one of Wiggins ' songs for House of Music , had Saadiq 's backing vocals pre @-@ recorded and subsequently overdubbed to the track 's final mix . 
 Wiggins found the group 's hiatus constructive to recording a follow @-@ up , so as not to produce an album derivative of Sons of Soul . He said of the music in an interview for Billboard , " It 's not just a bunch of grooves that we put together and made sure that the tempo fit . Lyrically and musically , it talks about something , and you 're able to feel the emotional buildup that we felt when we were making the songs ... It 's funny though . Even though we did the music separately , when we got together , it all had the same kind of sound . " The group intended on recording with an emphasis on musicianship rather than production . Wiggins noted a lack of synthesizers as distinctive of the music , adding that " On a lot of the songs , you can just imagine a five @-@ piece band performing . " Guest musicians for the album included rapper and producer DJ Quik , percussionist Sheila E. , and the Tower of Power horn section . House of Music was mastered by audio engineer Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood , California . 
 One of Saadiq 's songs for the album , " Me and the Blind Man " , was excluded from the album 's final mix . Originally issued on an album sampler sent by the group 's label to music journalists , the recording is a moody , bluesy song with surreal lyrics about lust , longing , and a fictitious blind man 's secret powers . In a 1997 interview for Yahoo ! Music , Saadiq expressed that he meant to show " a darker side ... some depth " to listeners with the song and said of its significance to the album , " To me songs like ' Blind Man , ' make the whole sound , the House of Music . " He said that it was not included on the album to equally represent each group members ' songwriting , stating " They didn 't want anybody playing favorites , so one of my songs had to come off . " 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 House of Music expands on the group 's previous traditional R & B @-@ influenced work with live instrumentation and an emphasis on ballads . Dan <unk> of the Daily Herald said it is " half a tribute to their ' 60s and ' 70s soul music roots and half a masterful blend of modern smooth balladeering and danceable funk . " Music journalist Jennie <unk> of Salon felt the songs are mostly " ballads — long , slow , emotional numbers with muted beats " that accentuate the lyrics . Drum wrote that mid @-@ tempo songs such as " Thinking of You " and " Still a Man " " lean heavily on ' 60s soul / R & B given a contemporary face , " while up @-@ tempo songs such as " Lovin ' You " , " Don 't Fall in Love " , and " Let 's Get Down " have elements of funk . 
 Music critics described the lyrics on House of Music as witty and sensitive . Michaelangelo Matos of the Chicago Reader characterized Saadiq 's songwriting as playful and quirky , while comparing his tenor singing voice to that of a young Michael Jackson . On Wiggins ' songwriting style , Matos said his melodies and rhythms are more subtle than those of Saadiq and observed " burnished <unk> , hushed burr , and starry @-@ eyed falsetto " in Wiggins ' singing . Saadiq alternated as lead <unk> with Wiggins throughout the album . Richard Torres of Newsday attributed the group 's lyrics on the album to their " [ belief ] in the power of love and the lure of romance . " 
 According to Saadiq , the opening track " Thinking of You " is " a really soul , southern , funky song " inspired by Al Green . It has light guitar strokes and Southern twang by Saadiq , while " Top Notch " draws on jazz and psychedelic elements . On " Still a Man " , he sings from the perspective of a man who was left by his wife to raise their children alone . The backing vocalists sing the song 's meditative hook , " Have you ever loved somebody / Who loves you so much it hurts you to hurt them so bad ? " On the lighthearted " Holy Smokes & Gee Whiz " , Saadiq 's older brother Randall Wiggins sings lead . The song was described by one critic as an " update of the Stylistics ' ' Betcha By Golly , Wow , ' " with " a dead @-@ on impression of Russell Thompkins ' unmistakable falsetto and precise diction . " " Annie May " is a salacious , humorous song about a <unk> , while " Let Me Know " is a love song with Wall of Sound elements . According to Nick Krewen of The Spectator , " Wild Child " is " a ballad in the grand sense of Earth , Wind and Fire 's ' Be Ever Wonderful . ' " " Party Don 't Cry " is a meditation on mortality with jazzy , philosophical tones . Rickey Wright of the Washington City Paper said the song " expresses an overt spirituality unheard in the Tonyies ' past songs . " The closing track is a gospel @-@ influenced instrumental and variation of " Lovin ' You " composed by Saadiq . Its sole lyric is a universalist platitude .

 The group 's fourth album , House of Music was released on November 19 , 1996 , by Mercury Records . The label intended on a release date during the peak holiday shopping period and ran ad campaigns scheduled for network cable , syndicated television shows , and radio stations . House of Music charted at number 32 and spent 31 weeks on the Billboard 200 . In its first eight weeks , the album sold 318 @,@ 502 copies in the US . Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! inaugurated its release with a satellite press conference and in @-@ store performance at a small business retailer in the San Francisco Bay Area . They also embarked on a tour of historically black colleges and Black Independent Coalition record shops after " Let 's Get Down " had been sent to R & B and crossover radio on October 28 as the album 's lead single ; its music video was released to outlets such as BET , The Box , and MTV . Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! performed the song as a musical guest on the sketch comedy show All That , while on Soul Train , they performed " Let 's Get Down " and " Annie May " . " Thinking of You " was released as the second single on March 11 , 1997 , by which time House of Music had sold 514 @,@ 000 copies , according to Nielsen SoundScan . On August 6 , the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . 
 Reviewing House of Music in Entertainment Weekly , Ken Tucker found Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! ' s imitations of classic sounds " intelligent , sometimes brilliant " , " witty " , and " tremendously likable " , with " a new recurring theme : what makes a man a man and a woman a woman , explored with both frankness and slyness . " Sonia Murray of The Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution hailed it as " the most versatile and efficacious of the trio 's four albums " , while Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot said " they find rapture that is steeped in reality rather than in the upwardly mobile fantasy concocted by many of today 's less tradition @-@ conscious R & B crooners . " " The <unk> serve as a sort of stylistic missing link " , wrote J. D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun , " suggesting what would have happened had the soul styles of the ' 70s continued to evolve , instead of being tossed aside by the synth @-@ driven sound of the ' 80s . " Michael A. Gonzales from Vibe said the album " glows a vision of blackness that is <unk> , mad smooth , and crazy sexy . " He described it as " a wonderland of harmonic delights , softcore <unk> , and slow @-@ jam fever floating on the tip of Cupid 's arrow " , showing the group " exploring the sensuality of black pop without sounding like boulevard bullies stalking their objects of desire . " Robert Christgau deemed " Thinking of You " a " hilariously gutsy " and spot @-@ on Al Green homage while writing of the group 's artistry in The Village Voice : 
 After the album 's release , the group dealt with growing tensions stemming from creative differences , business @-@ related problems , and Saadiq 's interest in a solo career . In an interview for Vibe at the time , Saadiq said of the situation within the group , " There 's a quiet stress between us that no one really talks about . And what 's sad about the whole thing is the fact that our friendship is disintegrating . Who knows , House of Music could be the last Tony Toni Toné album . " However , they remained committed to promoting House of Music through 1997 . On February 28 , the group taped a performance for VH1 's Hard Rock Live special . According to an interview with Mercury vice president Marty <unk> in October 1996 , an international tour for the album was expected , with concert dates in Japan and the United Kingdom , but it never materialized . In November 1997 , Saadiq told the Philadelphia Daily News " there should have been like four singles from that album . You 'll have to call Mercury on that . It went platinum with no promotional tour . We did our job and they made their money . " They subsequently disbanded and each member pursued an individual music career . 
 In retrospect , Christgau attributed the album 's success to Saadiq 's lead role in the group while claiming " only with House of Music did they become true sons of the soul revival , the most accomplished r & b act of the ' 90s . That 's still the album to remember them by . " AllMusic editor Leo Stanley points out Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! ' s " traditional soul and R & B values of songwriting , " writing that they " successfully accomplish their fusion of the traditional and contemporary [ ... ] within the framework of memorable , catchy songs . " <unk> noted its influence on neo soul artists such as Tony Rich and Maxwell at the time . Chicago Reader writer Michaelangelo Matos viewed that the album showcased " the contrast between Saadiq 's and Wiggins 's styles " , which " had grown so pronounced that the tension only enhanced what was already the group 's best batch of songs . " Rashod <unk> of The Virginian @-@ Pilot deemed the record " a flawless gem " where the band 's " amalgamation of traditional and contemporary styles coalesced beautifully . " In The Rolling Stone Album Guide ( 2004 ) , Fred Schruers said " House of Music consolidates the triumph of Sons of Soul for a masterpiece of 1990s R & B , an album that is as steeped in soul tradition as anything by Maxwell or D 'Angelo , but that mixes the homage with humor and deft contemporary touches , thereby creating a new space all its own " .

 = Teardrops on My Guitar = 
 " Teardrops on My Guitar " is a song by American country pop singer @-@ songwriter Taylor Swift . The song was co @-@ written by Swift , alongside Liz Rose and produced by Nathan Chapman with Swift 's aid . " Teardrops on My Guitar " was released on February 19 , 2007 by Big Machine Records , as the second single from Swift 's eponymous debut studio album ( 2006 ) . The song was later included on the international release of Swift 's second studio album , Fearless ( 2008 ) , and released as the second pop single from the album in the United Kingdom . It was inspired by Swift 's experience with Drew Hardwick , a classmate of hers for whom she had feelings . He was completely unaware and continually spoke about his girlfriend to Swift , something she pretended to be endeared by . Years afterwards , Hardwick appeared at Swift 's house , but Swift rejected him . Musically , the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle acoustic guitar . Critics have queried the song 's classification as country music , with those in agreement ( such as Grady Smith of Rolling Stone ) citing the themes and narrative style as country @-@ influenced and those opposed ( such as Roger Holland of PopMatters ) indicating the pop music production and instrumentation lack traditional country elements . 
 Critics received the track generally positively , complimenting Swift 's vocal delivery and songwriting style . The song is considered to be Swift 's breakthrough single , as it spread her popularity throughout the United States . " Teardrops on My Guitar " was commercially successful , peaking at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 , becoming the best @-@ charting single from Taylor Swift on the chart , and being Swift 's debut entry on the Billboard Year @-@ End Hot 100 charts . The single was also certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . Its music video was directed by Trey Fanjoy and features Swift as she sees her love interest develop a relationship with another female . The video received a nomination for MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist , but lost to Tokio Hotel 's music video for " Ready , Set , Go ! " . The song was promoted through multiple live performances , some while supporting as opening act for various country artists ' concert tours . She also performed " Teardrops on My Guitar " on her first headlining tour , the Fearless Tour ( 2009 – 10 ) .

 Swift was inspired to write " Teardrops on My Guitar " about her experience with a boy named Drew Hardwick , a classmate of hers whom she had feelings for . Hardwick later went on to join the Navy . During their freshman year of high school at Hendersonville High School , Swift and Hardwick sat beside each other in a class everyday . The two developed a fond friendship , although Swift secretively desired for it to become a romantic relationship . Because of Hardwick 's unawareness , he would frequently speak to Swift about a girl he had feelings for , something Swift pretended to be endeared by , commenting , " How beautiful she was , how nice and smart and perfect she was . And I sat there and listened , never meaning it any of the times I said ' Oh , I 'm so happy for you . ' " Hardwick and his love interest eventually developed a relationship which lasted for a few years . Swift never confessed her feelings to him . By the release of Taylor Swift , he remained unaware of Swift 's intentions or the song and continued his relationship with the same female . Upon " Teardrops on My Guitar " ' s release as a single , Hardwick attempted to contact Swift via phone calls , which Swift did not respond to ; he then left voicemails , but Swift felt too awkward to call back . 
 Two years after the album 's release , as she was leaving her house to attend a Nashville Predators hockey game with Kellie Pickler and Carrie Underwood , Hardwick appeared at her driveway . A car parked and , out of it , exited Hardwick and a friend of his . After two and a half years of not speaking , the two conversed : " He was like , ' Hey , how 's it going ? ' And I 'm like , ' Wow , you 're late . Good to see you . ' But we were civilized . " Swift conjectured multiple theories as to why Hardwick appeared at her house .

 The accompanying video to " Teardrops on My Guitar " was directed by Trey Fanjoy , who directed the video for " Tim McGraw " .

She appreciated all the preparation techniques that she taught her and stated , " You have to remember the people who were good to you in the beginning " . Swift said the video centered around unrequited love . Some of Swift 's associates first believed the video should have been set in a prior era . They then thought about filming the video at a large city . However , Swift wanted to go back to basics and keep the song 's integrity by filming the video in Nashville , Tennessee . American singer and actor Tyler Hilton portrayed Drew . He was cast because of prior interactions with Swift . They had a mutual fondness for each other 's music . Taking into account his acting on the television series One Tree Hill and the film Walk the Line ( 2005 ) , Swift asked him to participate in the video after he attended and performed at one of her concerts . Swift chose Hilton primarily because he accurately presented Drew Hardwick , the fun , funny , fun @-@ loving , blue @-@ eyed boy whom she was friends with and had a huge crush on during high school . The video was filmed in one day in March 2007 at Hume @-@ Fogg High School ; the drama room was transformed to simulate a bedroom for the performance scenes . 
 The video commences with Drew asking Swift , " Hey , are you gonna go to the game on Friday ? " Swift responds , " Well , I was thinking about it . Why ? " He then admits it was just curiosity , informs Swift about a girl he met , and walks away . The video then transcends to Swift , wearing a long aquamarine evening gown , lying beside an acoustic guitar on a mattress in a bedroom . She performs the song until the scene transitions to Swift and Drew at the library , where he parodies a novel and she chuckles . The librarian requests for the two to maintain silence , so they converse quietly . Afterwards , Swift is in a chemistry laboratory , where she is mixing substances . Distracted by Drew approaching her , she accidentally pours too much of one substance and causes it to spill . They both rapidly attempt to clean the mess generated . As the song approaches its bridge , Swift and Drew walk towards each other , both smiling , but Drew then kisses his girlfriend , as Swift watches in agony . The video again transcends to the performance scene , where it concludes . Cut @-@ scenes feature Swift lying on the mattress , crying , and standing beside a fireplace in the bedroom . The video received a nomination for " Number One Streamed Music Video " at the web @-@ hosted 2007 CMT Online Awards , but lost to Sugarland 's " Stay " ( 2007 ) .

 = St Tyfrydog 's Church , Llandyfrydog = 
 St Tyfrydog 's Church , Llandyfrydog is a small medieval church , in Llandyfrydog , Anglesey , north Wales . The date of establishment of a church on this site is unknown , but one 19th @-@ century Anglesey historian says that it was about 450 . The oldest parts of the present building ( such as the nave and the chancel arch ) are dated to about 1400 , with the chancel dating from the late 15th or early 16th century . It is built from rough , small , squared stones , dressed with limestone . One of the windows on the south side is raised to illuminate the pulpit , a decision that in the eyes of one 19th @-@ century commentator " disfigures the building . " 
 According to local tradition , a standing stone about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) away is the petrified remains of a man who stole a bible from the church and was punished by St Tyfrydog as a result . The Welsh historian Gerald of Wales said that when the Norman lord Hugh of Montgomery was putting down the Welsh revolt led by Gruffudd ap Cynan in 1098 , he kept his dogs in the church . The dogs had gone mad by the morning , and Montgomery himself was killed within a week . 
 The church is still in use for worship , as part of the Church in Wales , as one of four churches in a combined parish . It is a Grade II * listed building , a national designation given to " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " , in particular because it is a " good Medieval rural church which retains much of its Medieval fabric " . The circular churchyard walls and an 18th @-@ century sundial in the churchyard have also been given listed building status . 
 = = History and location = = 
 St Tyfrydog 's Church is in a wooded circular churchyard in the middle of the hamlet of Llandyfrydog in Anglesey , north Wales . It is about 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from the county town of Llangefni . Llandyfrydog takes its name from the church : the Welsh word llan originally meant " enclosure " and then " church " , and " <unk> " is a modified form of the saint 's name . 
 The 19th @-@ century Anglesey historian Angharad Llwyd wrote that a church was supposed to have been first built here around 450 ; Samuel Lewis , writing in 1849 , said that the original church was established by St <unk> himself . An upright stone about 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) high , which stands in a field about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the village , is known as " the thief of <unk> " . It is said by local tradition to be a man turned into stone by St <unk> for stealing the church 's bible ; the lump near the top of the stone is said to be the sack on the man 's shoulder . 
 In his 1191 Itinerarium Cambriae ( " Journey through Wales " ) , Gerald of Wales mentioned the church , saying that when the Normans were ransacking Anglesey during a Welsh revolt led by Gruffudd ap Cynan in 1098 , Hugh of Montgomery , one of the Norman lords , had kept his dogs in <unk> church . He added that the dogs had gone mad by the morning , and the earl had been killed within a week . 
 A church was recorded here in 1254 during the Norwich Taxation , but the oldest part of the present building is the nave dating from about 1400 . The chancel was rebuilt at the end of the 15th century or in the first part of the following century . Restoration work took place in 1823 , and then again 1862 , when the present porch ( on the west end of the south wall ) and the vestry ( to the north ) were added , along with other alterations . 
 The church , which is still used for services as part of the Church in Wales , is one of four in the parish of Amlwch , the others being the churches of St Eleth , Amlwch , St Eilian , Llaneilian , and St Gwenllwyfo , Llanwenllwyfo . As of 2012 , the priest in charge is H. V. Jones . The parish is in the deanery of Twrcelyn , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . 
 People associated with the church include the Welsh botanist Hugh Davies , born in 1739 when his father Lewis was the rector ; Thomas Ellis Owen , rector from 1794 , who wrote anti @-@ Methodist pamphlets ; and James Henry Cotton ( rector in 1814 ; appointed Dean of Bangor Cathedral in 1838 ) . The priest and antiquarian Nicholas Owen was born in <unk> when his father was the rector ( from 1750 to 1785 ) . Owen petitioned , unsuccessfully , on three occasions to be given the living , and he was eventually buried here . 
 = = Architecture and fittings = = 
 St Tyfrydog 's is built from rough , small , squared stones , dressed with limestone . The nave measures about 24 feet 9 inches by 23 feet 6 inches ( about 7 @.@ 5 m by 7 @.@ 2 m ) ; the chancel is about 23 feet 3 inches by 18 feet 9 inches ( about 7 @.@ 1 m by 5 @.@ 7 m ) . The roof is made of slate , with a stone bellcote at the west end housing one bell . The roof timbers are visible from inside the church . There are buttresses at the east end of the nave and at the entrance to the porch . 
 The oldest window is to the east side of the porch , on the south wall , which dates from about 1400 ; it has two lights ( sections of window separated by a mullion ) topped by trefoils , set in a rectangular window frame . It is echoed by a 19th @-@ century window on the same wall , set slightly higher to illuminate the pulpit . The north wall has two rectangular windows , one with a pair of lights topped by cinquefoils , the other a single light with a trefoil at the top . One of the windows has been inserted into an opening previously used as a doorway . The east window , which has three lights , dates from the latter part of the 15th century , and is the only window to contain stained glass . Inside , the division between nave and chancel is marked with a pointed arch , dating from about 1400 . Seating is provided in the form of painted box pews , dating from the 19th century , and possibly installed at the time of the restoration work in 1823 . 
 A survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire in 1937 noted an 18th @-@ century communion table , an engraved Elizabethan silver cup and a silver paten dated 1721 , and a memorial inside the church dated 1791 . A 19th @-@ century writer noted a seat near the altar with " R.B. 1630 " upon it , said to mark it as belonging to the Bulkeley family ( who were prominent and influential landowners , in Anglesey and elsewhere in north Wales , from the 15th to the 19th centuries ) . The churchyard contains a number of slate tombs and a sundial made from brass , dating from the 18th century , standing in the base of a medieval stone cross . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II * listed building – the second @-@ highest of the three grades of listing , designating " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " . It was given this status on 12 May 1970 , being regarded " as a good Medieval rural church which retains much of its Medieval fabric " . Cadw ( the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes that the church still had " a rich vernacular character . " The churchyard 's stone wall and the sundial have both been given listed building status , at the lower level of Grade II ( for " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " ) . 
 The 19th @-@ century writer Samuel Lewis said that it was " a lofty and venerable structure , in excellent repair " , and with " a remarkably large chancel . " Writing in 1859 , the priest and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that the church was " one of the better sort " in Anglesey . At the time he saw the church , there was an old porch and the north door in the nave was still in use . He described the nave as " unusually high " , and said that the window positioned to light the pulpit " disfigures the building . " He also thought that the " high " chancel walls gave " great effect " to the interior . A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region described it as a " handsomely proportioned church " It particularly noted the nave , describing it as " broad , almost a square " , with the chancel arch " dying into the responds .

 = = Teaching career = = 
 He was Assistant Master at Marlborough College from 1872 to 1875 before being appointed Headmaster of Rossall School in 1875 . On the last day of his first year as headmaster , the whole school ( with the exception of a couple of students ) gathered outside the school to hiss and boo at James . Despite this , he held this position until 1886 and was regarded as having been " brilliantly successful , raising the school in the 11 years of his reign to a pitch of all @-@ round excellence which it had not known before " . His students at Rossall included Henry Stuart @-@ Jones , who became a distinguished classical scholar . One of Stuart @-@ Jones 's contemporaries later gave James the credit for making Stuart @-@ Jones an " accurate and industrious scholar " . 
 The strain of his position at Rossall School having affected his health , he was appointed Dean of St Asaph in 1886 . In 1889 , his health restored , he left St Asaph to become Principal of Cheltenham College ( 1889 – 95 ) . He was again successful in this post , and was offered the position of Headmaster of Clifton College , but was prevailed upon to stay . He made participation in games a compulsory part of the boys ' education in 1889 . He also started the building of a new chapel to mark the college 's centenary in 1891 . When Dr Percival was appointed Bishop of Hereford , James succeeded him in 1895 as Headmaster of Rugby School . He was headmaster for 14 years and was very well regarded : it was said that the school had " seldom stood higher since Arnold 's day " than under his leadership ( in reference to Thomas Arnold , who was headmaster from 1828 to 1841 ) . He was also described in his obituary in The Times as having " once more showed himself a complete master of his profession , equally effective and esteemed in the class @-@ room and the pulpit , in the School House of Dr. Arnold , and on the playing fields . " He was nicknamed " The <unk> " , and this term is still part of Rugby School slang . King Edward VII visited Rugby School towards the end of James 's time as headmaster on 3 July 1909 , the first royal visit to the School . 
 = = St John 's College = = 
 He returned to Oxford in 1909 as President of St John 's College ( having been made an honorary fellow in 1895 ) and held this position until his death in 1931 . He was regarded during this time as a leader for the causes of the church and the Conservative Party , and was described as " winning all hearts with his geniality , his good sense , and his readiness to help all with whom he was brought into contact . " In 1918 , during his time as college President , his photograph was taken for inclusion in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery . 
 He was made a Companion of Honour by King George V in the Birthday Honours List of 1926 .

Other guests included Viscount Lee , Sir Maurice Hankey ( the Cabinet Secretary ) , the sculptor Sir George Frampton , the civil servant Ernest Gowers ( who had been educated at Rugby when James was headmaster ) and the MP Sir James <unk> @-@ Gardner . Austen Chamberlain ( the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and a governor of Rugby School ) spoke , along with representatives of the other schools with which he had been associated . Lord Cave praised James 's directness in his opinions and decisions , his weighty judgment , his high character and his kindly nature . He said that membership of the <unk> of Honour had been given only to a few who had rendered " special social service " to the country , and he rejoiced that James had been " enrolled " in this " select band " . He added that St John 's College and Oxford University owed James a " debt of gratitude " for his " wise advice and guidance " . James , he said , " had never <unk> in the fine shades , or in the analysis of tendencies , or the exploration of avenues . Whatever was right had to be done . Whatever was wrong he fought with all his might . " 
 Marlborough School paid tribute to James through a poem by Charles Larcom Graves . One stanza was later quoted in the obituary of James published by The Times : 
 Chamberlain said that James had had a " remarkable scholastic career " and had exercised a " great and powerful influence " in the schools that he had served , leaving behind " a memory dear to all who had known him " . He said that James was regarded as " one of the greatest and most forceful characters who had ever devoted himself to education . " The dinner itself was reported as a news item in The Times on the following day , with a list of the principal attendees and summaries of the main speeches , and of James 's response , in which he said that he regarded the honour he had received as one bestowed on teaching .

 His publications included an edition with English notes of Cicero 's Pro <unk> ( 1871 ) and a collection of sermons from his time at Rossall School , published as School Ideals ( 1887 ) . He was very highly regarded as a preacher , being appointed as Select Preacher for Oxford University in 1894 , 1897 and 1900 ; he was said to be " undoubtedly one of the best preachers of his day , at school and elsewhere " . He was a keen cricketer and golfer , and had been captain of the Lincoln College XI when a student there . He was also said to have been a useful member of the St John 's College XI , both for his batting and his slow bowling . The story was told at the 1926 dinner in his honour that he had taught A G Steel how to bowl a " twister " , and that Steel had gone on to take many wickets in test matches against the Australians as a result . He was devoted to philately and had what was regarded as one of the best stamp collections in England . On his death , it was estimated as being worth between £ 5 @,@ 000 and £ 6 @,@ 000 ( approximately £ 310 @,@ 000 to £ 370 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) , despite the fact that he had dispersed much of his collection before his death .

He also left money to his old school in Abergavenny , Lincoln College , St John 's College and the schools at which he had been headmaster . He also left a sum to the Royal Philatelic Society . After other various bequests , he left the residue of his estate to his brother for life – as James had never married , his brother was his next of kin . After his brother 's death , his estate was to pass to St John 's College to assist undergraduates and to support the work of the choir . 
 James had been presented with a gold watch and chain when leaving his position as headmaster of Rossall School in 1886 . These were sold after his death , and were donated back to Rossall School by the purchaser ( a former student of the school ) for the use of future headmasters . A memorial tablet to James was erected in 1933 in the chapel of Rossall School ; it was unveiled by Lord Derby , president of the Rossall School Corporation . A oak chancel screen was also erected as a memorial to James in St Mary 's Church , Panteg , with the unveiling in 1935 being carried out by Lord <unk> , a friend of James since childhood .

A fan of video games , he began creating his own games in junior high school with some friends . While in his senior high school years , Sakimoto wrote for the computer magazine Oh ! FM and compiled data about pieces of music he liked , becoming a self @-@ professed " computer , games , and music geek " . 
 Sakimoto started composing for games when he was 16 , and was paid to both create the music and the program to play it for several games . Composing for these games was the first time he had ever composed music for any instrument . His debut as a professional gaming composer came in 1988 , when he and his friend Masaharu Iwata , whom he has worked with on numerous later titles , scored the shooter game Revolter , published by <unk> for the NEC PC @-@ 8801 . Sakimoto also created the synthesizer driver " <unk> " to enhance the sound quality of the game 's music ; the synthesizer driver has been implemented into many games throughout the Japanese game market in the early 1990s . Despite Revolter 's success , he continued with his previous goal to become a video game programmer rather than a composer ; however , his friends and colleagues encouraged him to continue composing game music . The recognition he gained within the gaming industry jump @-@ started his career . 
 = = = Career = = = 
 After Revolter , Sakimoto 's music and synthesizer driver earned him immediate recognition in the industry , resulting in him being asked to score several PC @-@ 9801 and Mega Drive games such as Starship Rendezvous and Gauntlet IV , as well as use his driver both in the scores he wrote and in other games such as Stone of <unk> in 1989 and The Witch of <unk> in 1990 . Between 1990 and 1992 , Sakimoto worked on over 20 different video games for several different companies such as Toshiba EMI , <unk> , and Data East . It was during this time that he composed his first solo score , for 1990 's Bubble Ghost . 
 Sakimoto 's first encounter with mainstream success in Japan came about in 1993 when he composed Ogre Battle : March of the Black Queen . The game was directed by Yasumi Matsuno , and since the release of the title , he has chosen Sakimoto as a regular for his development team at Quest and later Square . Sakimoto also worked on 14 other titles that year , including Shin Megami Tensei and Alien vs. Predator . Over the next few years , he would go on to compose for or work on over 40 more titles such as Tactics Ogre and Dragon Quest VI . In 1997 , Sakimoto joined Square and composed the score for Final Fantasy Tactics , which made him internationally famous , and was the score he was best known for outside Japan until at least 2006 . Although he worked on a handful of titles by other companies over the next few years , his next work for Square did not come until 2000 , with the successful Vagrant Story . It was his last score as an employee of Square ; although he went on to first compose Breath of Fire V and Tactics Ogre : The Knight of <unk> for Capcom and Quest , after a couple of years of planning he resigned from Square to form his own company , Basiscape , on October 4 , 2002 . 
 = = = Basiscape = = = 
 Basiscape composes and produces music and sound effects for various types of interactive media , most notably video games . Sakimoto says that he left Square to found the company because he did not feel that he had enough " freedom " as an employee of a game company , though he notes that the cost of that freedom is the difficulty in remaining close to the development team . At its founding , it comprised only three members : Sakimoto , Iwata , and Manabu <unk> . Through Basiscape , Sakimoto continued to compose for several different companies , including Square — now Square Enix — with Final Fantasy Tactics Advance . The company expanded in 2005 with the addition of composers Mitsuhiro Kaneda and Kimihiro Abe . After the huge success of 2006 's Final Fantasy XII , which he scored , demand for Sakimoto 's compositions grew stronger with gaming companies and he decided to expand Basiscape again by hiring Noriyuki <unk> , Yoshimi Kudo , and Azusa Chiba . It is currently the largest independent video game music production company , and continues to work on large titles such as Odin Sphere and Final Fantasy XII : Revenant Wings . The composers for the company are able to procure individual work for themselves as members of Basiscape , as well as collaborate with other staff members on projects that are hired out to Basiscape as a company rather than any one composer , which allows the composers to remain freelancers while having the steady work of a full @-@ time job . The company also handles sound effects and narration in addition to soundtracks for the projects that it works on , and at the end of 2009 expanded to start its own record label . 
 Sakimoto has also been involved in non @-@ gaming projects during his career . He contributed one track each to the albums Ten Plants ( 1998 ) and 2197 ( 1999 ) , which feature music from various well @-@ known artists . Sakimoto collaborated with singer Lia in 2005 to create the music for the album Colors of Life . He composed the music for two anime series ; Romeo x Juliet ( 2007 ) and The Tower of <unk> : The Aegis of Uruk ( 2008 ) ; as well as the original video animation ( OVA ) Legend of Phoenix ~ Layla Hamilton Monogatari ~ in 2005 . 
 = = Performances = = 
 Sakimoto has made numerous appearances at video game concerts that have performed his compositions . On July 12 , 2006 , he , along with Yoko Shimomura and Michael Salvatori , were special guests at a Play ! A Video Game Symphony event at the Orchestra Hall in Detroit , Michigan . He has developed a strong relationship with the Australian @-@ based Eminence Symphony Orchestra , and has attended several of their concerts . Sakimoto and Yasunori Mitsuda made a guest appearance at their Passion event in December 2006 . In April 2007 , he appeared at Eminence 's A Night in Fantasia 2007 : Symphonic Games Edition , which featured three of his compositions . Sakimoto and Mitsuda collaborated with Eminence in July the same year to create Destiny : Reunion , a concert held exclusively in Japan . Eminence released Passion ( 2006 ) and Destiny : Dreamer 's Alliance ( 2007 ) , two studio recorded albums that feature various compositions from the Passion and Destiny : Reunion concerts respectively . " Penelo 's Theme " from Final Fantasy XII and a medley of pieces from Final Fantasy Tactics A2 were played at the Fantasy Comes Alive concert in Singapore on April 30 , 2010 . Although there have been several official Final Fantasy concerts dedicated to the music of the series , none have included music by Sakimoto . A book of sheet music from the music of Final Fantasy XII rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos was produced by DOREMI publishing . 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Sakimoto composes his music by playing the pieces " briefly on the piano " , and then working on a computer for more detailed arrangements . The style of Sakimoto 's compositions is mostly orchestral ; he creates the orchestral sound by playing the music through a sequencer instead of using a real orchestra due to the high cost . When composing a soundtrack for a video game , Sakimoto first sits down with the director or producer of the game and works out what emotions they want the game to evoke in the player , and after making a demo for them , sets out to create music that fits that feeling . He claims that his style of composition does not change when he works on non @-@ game works such as anime series , saying that only the tone of the pieces is different . He attributes any changes in his style over the years to his desire to constantly keep growing and learning new styles and techniques , saying that if you have not moved forward in your skill and style over time , " you 've wasted your time " . 
 He has stated that his biggest musical influences are " old techno and progressive rock " groups such as the Japanese synthpop group Yellow Magic Orchestra . When he was starting out in the field of music , he went under the pseudonym " <unk> " , a reference to Yellow Magic Orchestra . He also cites the American jazz musician Chick Corea as a major influence . While creating the music for Final Fantasy XII , however , his biggest musical inspiration was former regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu . Sakimoto enjoys listening to techno and jazz fusion in his spare time . While he sometimes gets inspiration while relaxing at home , Sakimoto feels that his best ideas come to him while he is at his studio concentrating . One of his favorite soundtracks he ever composed was the one for Vagrant Story .

 = SM U @-@ 66 = 
 SM U @-@ 66 was the lead ship of the Type U @-@ 66 submarines or U @-@ boats for the Imperial German Navy ( German : Kaiserliche Marine ) during World War I. The submarine had been laid down in Kiel in November 1913 as U @-@ 7 , the lead ship of the U @-@ 7 class for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ( German : Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine or K.u.K. Kriegsmarine ) . They became convinced after the outbreak of war in August 1914 that none of these submarines could be delivered to the Adriatic via Gibraltar , and sold the entire class , including U @-@ 7 , to the German Imperial Navy in November 1914 . 
 Under German control , the class became known as the U @-@ 66 type and the boats were renumbered ; U @-@ 7 became U @-@ 66 , and all were redesigned and reconstructed to German specifications . U @-@ 66 was launched in April 1915 and commissioned in July . As completed , she displaced 791 tonnes ( 779 long tons ) when surfaced and 933 tonnes ( 918 long tons ) submerged . The boat was 69 @.@ 50 metres ( 228 ft ) long and was armed with five torpedo tubes and a deck gun . 
 As a part of the Baltic and 4th Flotillas , U @-@ 66 sank 24 ships with a combined gross register tonnage of 69 @,@ 967 in six war patrols . The U @-@ boat also torpedoed and damaged the British cruiser Falmouth in August 1916 . U @-@ 66 left Emden on her seventh patrol on 2 September 1917 for operations in the North Channel . The following day the U @-@ boat reported her position in the North Sea but neither she nor any of her 40 @-@ man crew were ever heard from again . A postwar German study offered no explanation for U @-@ 66 's loss , although British records suggest that she may have struck a mine in the Dogger Bank area . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 After the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy had competitively evaluated three foreign submarine designs , it selected the Germaniawerft 506d design , also known as the Type UD , for its new U @-@ 7 class of five submarines . The Navy ordered five boats on 1 February 1913 . 
 The U @-@ 7 class was seen by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy as an improved version of its U @-@ 3 class , which was also a Germaniawerft design . As designed for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , the boats were to displace 695 long tons ( 706 t ) on the surface and 885 long tons ( 899 t ) while submerged . The double @-@ hulled boats were to be 228 @.@ 0 feet ( 69 @.@ 50 m ) long overall with a beam of 20 feet 8 inches ( 6 @.@ 30 m ) and a draft of 12 feet 5 inches ( 3 @.@ 79 m ) . The Austrian specifications called for two shafts with twin diesel engines ( 2 @,@ 269 shp ( 1 @,@ 692 kW ) total ) for surface running at up to 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) , and twin electric motors ( 1 @,@ 223 shp ( 912 kW ) total ) for a maximum of 11 knots ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) when submerged . The boats were designed with five 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes ; four located in the bow , one in the stern . The boats ' armament was to also include a single 66 mm / 26 ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) deck gun . 
 U @-@ 7 and sister boat SM U @-@ 67 were both laid down on 1 November 1913 , the first two boats of the class begun . Their construction was scheduled for completion within 29 to 33 months , but neither U @-@ 7 nor any of her sister boats were complete when World War I began in August 1914 . Because the boats were under construction at Kiel on the Baltic Sea , the Austrians became convinced that it would be impossible to take delivery : the boats would need to be transferred into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar , a British territory . As a result , U @-@ 7 and her four sisters were sold to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914 . 
 U @-@ 7 was renumbered by the Germans as U @-@ 66 when her class was redesignated as the Type U @-@ 66 . The Imperial German Navy had the submarines redesigned and reconstructed to German standards , increasing the surface and submerged displacements by 96 and 48 tonnes ( 94 and 47 long tons ) , respectively . The torpedo load was increased by a third , from 9 to 12 , and the deck gun size was upgraded from the 6 @.@ 6 @-@ centimeter ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) size originally specified to 8 @.@ 8 centimeters ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) . 
 = = Early career = = 
 U @-@ 66 was launched on 22 April 1915 . On 23 July , SM U @-@ 66 was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy under the command of Kapitänleutnant ( Kptlt . ) Thorwald von Bothmer , a 31 @-@ year @-@ old , thirteen @-@ year veteran of the Imperial German Navy . U @-@ 66 was assigned to the Baltic Flotilla ( German : U @-@ boote der <unk> V. <unk> @-@ <unk> ) on 17 October . 
 In late September , the British submarine flotilla in the Baltic began a submarine offensive against German ships , intending to deny free passage of cargo , especially iron ore , from neutral Sweden to Germany . In A Naval History of World War I , author Paul G. Halpern reports on part of the German response , which was an experiment involving U @-@ 66 . The U @-@ boat was towed behind an " innocent @-@ looking vessel " and connected to the host ship by a telephone line in addition to the towline . U @-@ 66 was able to cast off at a moment 's notice to attack an enemy submarine . Halpern does not report on any encounters by U @-@ 66 , nor does he provide any insight into the overall effectiveness of the plan . U @-@ 66 was not credited with the sinking of any vessels of any kind during this time . On 15 January 1916 , she was transferred from the Baltic Flotilla into the 4th Flotilla ( German : IV . <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , where she joined her sister boats U @-@ 67 and U @-@ 68 . 
 = = Second German offensive = = 
 Germany began its second submarine offensive against shipping the month after U @-@ 66 joined the 4th Flotilla . As in the first submarine offensive , U @-@ boats were sent independently around Scotland to patrol the Irish Sea and the western entrance to the English Channel . The first reported activity of U @-@ 66 during this campaign reveals that she sank her first ship on 5 April 1916 . On that date she was in the vicinity of Fastnet Rock and came upon the 3 @,@ 890 @-@ ton British refrigerated cargo ship <unk> headed from Garston to Santa Marta in ballast . U @-@ 66 torpedoed <unk> 28 nautical miles ( 52 km ; 32 mi ) from Fastnet and sank the ship with the loss of 49 crewmen ; the master and nine sailors were rescued and landed at Queenstown . Over the next two days , U @-@ 66 dispatched two French sailing vessels , the 151 @-@ ton <unk> , and the 397 @-@ ton fishing smack Sainte Marie west of the Isles of Scilly . On 8 April , von Bothmer and U @-@ 66 sank the Spanish @-@ flagged Santanderino 18 nautical miles ( 33 km ; 21 mi ) from Ushant . Santanderino , a 3 @,@ 346 @-@ ton ship built in 1890 , was sailing from Liverpool to Havana , and U @-@ 66 gave 15 minutes ' notice for all the passengers and crew to abandon ship ; four drowned during the evacuation . Santanderino 's 36 survivors were rescued by a Danish steamer and landed at a port on the Bay of Biscay . 
 U @-@ 66 continued her attacks on merchant shipping on 9 April with the sinking of three ships , the British steamers Eastern City and Glenalmond and the Norwegian ship Sjolyst . The 4 @,@ 341 @-@ ton Eastern City was sailing from Saint @-@ Nazaire to Barry Roads in ballast when she was shelled by U @-@ 66 and sent to the bottom 18 nautical miles ( 33 km ; 21 mi ) from Ushant ; all of her crew survived and were landed by 11 April . U @-@ 66 's next victim was the 2 @,@ 888 @-@ ton Glenalmond sailing from Bilbao to Clyde laden with iron ore . Torpedoes from U @-@ 66 sank the ship 27 nautical miles ( 50 km ; 31 mi ) north of Ushant , but all her crew were saved . The 20 @-@ year @-@ old Norwegian steamer Sjolyst was sailing in ballast from Nantes to Manchester when U @-@ 66 sank her about two nautical miles ( four kilometers ) from where Glenalmond went down . Sjolyst 's master and entire crew were picked up by the British steamer Libra and landed at Cardiff . 
 U @-@ 66 finished out her busy month the next day by sinking one British and one Italian ship . U @-@ 66 sank the British steamer Margam Abbey 55 nautical miles ( 102 km ; 63 mi ) southwest of the Lizard while the ship was en route from Bordeaux to Barry Roads in ballast . Margam Abbey , at 4 @,@ 471 tons , was the largest ship sunk by U @-@ 66 to that time . The Italian freighter Unione was sailing with a load of coal from Clyde for Genoa when U @-@ 66 torpedoed her off Land 's End . The sinking of Unione , with a tonnage of 2 @,@ 367 , raised U @-@ 66 's tally for the month of April to eight ships with a combined tonnage of 22 @,@ 848 , all sunk in a six @-@ day span . Near the end of April 1916 , Admiral Reinhard Scheer , the new commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the High Seas Fleet ( under which U @-@ 66 's 4th Flotilla operated ) , called off the merchant shipping offensive and ordered all boats at sea to return , and all boats in port to remain there . 
 = = Grand Fleet ambushes = = 
 In mid @-@ May 1916 , Scheer completed plans to draw out part of the British Grand Fleet . The German High Seas Fleet would sortie for a raid on Sunderland , luring the British fleet across " ' nests ' of submarines and mine @-@ fields " . U @-@ 66 was one of nine U @-@ boats that put out to sea beginning on 17 May to scout the central North Sea for signs of the British fleet . Completing five days of scouting , U @-@ 66 , along with U @-@ 63 , U @-@ 51 , U @-@ 32 , sister boat U @-@ 70 , U @-@ 24 , and U @-@ 52 , took up position off the Firth of Forth on 23 May . The other two boats , U @-@ 43 and U @-@ 44 , were stationed off Pentland Firth , in position to attack the British fleet leaving Scapa Flow . All the boats were to remain on station until 1 June and await a coded message which would report the sailing of the British fleet . Unfortunately for the Germans , the British Admiralty had intelligence reports of the departure of the submarines which , coupled with an absence of attacks on shipping , aroused British suspicions . 
 A delayed departure of the German fleet for its sortie ( which had been redirected to the Skagerrak ) and the failure of five U @-@ boats , including U @-@ 66 , to receive the coded message warning of the British advance caused Scheer 's anticipated ambush to be a " complete and disappointing failure " . Although she had not received the advance warning of the coded message , U @-@ 66 was one of the two ambush U @-@ boats that actually saw parts of the British fleet . At 09 : 00 on 31 May , U @-@ 66 sent out a wireless report of eight battleships , light cruisers , and destroyers on a northerly course 60 nautical miles ( 110 km ; 69 mi ) east of Kinnaird Head . U @-@ 66 was unable to make any attacks on the ships she reported due to the presence of screening vessels . The failure of the submarine ambush to sink any British capital ships allowed the full Grand Fleet to engage the numerically inferior High Seas Fleet in the Battle of Jutland , which took place 31 May – 1 June . 
 The next mention of U @-@ 66 in sources is on 11 August , when she sank <unk> , a 613 @-@ ton three @-@ masted Norwegian bark . <unk> was carrying a load of pit props from Sandefjord to Hartlepool when she was sunk some 160 nautical miles ( 300 km ; 180 mi ) east of Aberdeen . 
 Later in August , the Germans set up another ambush for the British fleet , when they drew up plans for another High Seas Fleet raid on Sunderland ( as had been the original intention in May ) . The German fleet planned to depart late in the day on 18 August and shell military targets the next morning . U @-@ 66 was one of 24 U @-@ boats that formed five lines ( German : Standlinie ) in the expected paths of any Grand Fleet sorties . Standlinie II , consisting of U @-@ 63 , U @-@ 49 , U @-@ 45 , U @-@ 66 , and U @-@ 64 , formed a 35 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 65 km ; 40 mi ) front 12 nautical miles ( 22 km ; 14 mi ) off Flamborough Head . The other four Standlinie formed similar lines to the north and south ; all were to be in place by 08 : 00 on 19 August . Once again , British intelligence had given warning of the impending attack and ambush , causing the Grand Fleet to sortie at 16 : 00 on 18 August , five hours before the German fleet sailed . 
 At 04 : 45 on 19 August , U @-@ 66 fired a spread of two torpedoes at the British light cruiser Falmouth from a distance of 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) . Both torpedoes scored hits on Falmouth 's starboard side , flooding the warship forward and aft . The cruiser 's mechanical spaces — located amidships — remained intact and in working order , so she was steered to the Humber with an escort of three destroyers and an armed trawler . U @-@ 66 tried repeatedly to deal the stricken cruiser a coup de grâce , but narrowly missed with torpedoes on several further attacks . U @-@ 66 broke off her pursuit after two hours , having endured multiple attacks from Falmouth 's screening destroyers . One depth charge attack blew out all the lights on U @-@ 66 and knocked clips off two hatches that caused the boat to flood with a considerable quantity of water before the leaks could be sealed . Falmouth continued under tow at 2 knots ( 3 @.@ 7 km / h ) until she crossed Standlinie II and was attacked and sunk by U @-@ 63 around noon the next day . 
 Records on U @-@ 66 next appear in late 1916 , when she is reported as one of the U @-@ boat escorts assisting the German merchant raider Wolf into the North Atlantic . Wolf , under the command of Karl August <unk> , began a 15 @-@ month raiding voyage on 30 November that took the ship into the Indian and Pacific Oceans before a safe return to Germany . U @-@ 66 's specific locations for this duty are not reported , but on 11 December she sank a Norwegian steamer and a Swedish sailing ship . U @-@ 66 shelled the 1 @,@ 090 @-@ ton Norwegian steamer <unk> 4 nautical miles ( 7 @.@ 4 km ; 4 @.@ 6 mi ) southwest of the Norwegian island of <unk> . The ship and her general cargo , headed from Göteborg to Hull , were sent to the bottom without loss of life , and her crew was safely landed by 14 December . The same day , U @-@ 66 also sank the 311 @-@ ton Swedish sailing ship <unk> off the island of <unk> , near the town of Tornio on the Sweden – Finland border . 
 = = Unrestricted submarine warfare = = 
 From the early stages of the war the Royal Navy had blockaded Germany , preventing neutral shipping from reaching German ports . By the time of the so @-@ called " turnip winter " of 1916 – 17 , the blockade had severely limited imports of food and fuel into Germany . Among the results were an increase in infant mortality and as many as 700 @,@ 000 deaths attributed to starvation or hypothermia during the war . With the blockade having such dire consequences , Kaiser Wilhelm II personally approved a resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare to begin on 1 February 1917 to help force the British to make peace . The new rules of engagement specified that no ship was to be left afloat . 
 U @-@ 66 's first victim under the new rules was encountered on 1 March . The Norwegian steamer <unk> , reported as 1 @,@ 733 tons , was crossing the North Sea while steaming from Narvik and <unk> for Hull with a cargo of iron ore . U @-@ 66 torpedoed her at position 59 ° 30 ′ N 2 ° 0 ′ E , sending the doomed Norwegian ship into the murky depths with 20 of her crew . The same day , U @-@ 66 encountered another Norwegian cargo ship , the 1 @,@ 005 @-@ ton Livingstone , headed from Skien to Charente with a cargo of ammonium nitrate . Livingstone 's cargo , used in the making of explosives and munitions , was too valuable to destroy . U @-@ 66 's captain seized the ship as a prize east of Shetland . Further details of the encounter do not appear in sources , but it is known that the 11 @-@ year @-@ old Livingstone not only survived the war , but remained in service under a variety of names until she was scrapped in 1962 . 
 In late March , U @-@ 66 sank another two vessels . The 3 @,@ 597 @-@ ton cargo ship Stuart Prince was headed from Manchester and Belfast to Alexandria with a general cargo when U @-@ 66 came upon her 85 nautical miles ( 157 km ; 98 mi ) off Broad Haven , County Mayo . U @-@ 66 's torpedo attack was successful , sinking the ship and killing 20 men , including the ship 's master . Five days later , U @-@ 66 encountered the five @-@ masted bark Neath 28 nautical miles ( 52 km ; 32 mi ) south by east of Fastnet Rock . Equipped with an auxiliary triple @-@ expansion steam engine , Neath was the former German bark R. C. Rickmers which had been seized by the Admiralty at Cardiff in August 1914 . After U @-@ 66 torpedoed Neath at 08 : 45 , the bark , en route from Martinique to Le Havre with a load of sugar , sank in seven minutes . The master of Neath was taken prisoner , but had been released and landed at Queenstown two days later . 
 During April 1917 , German U @-@ boats sank 860 @,@ 334 tons of Allied and neutral shipping , a monthly total unsurpassed in either of the two world wars . U @-@ 66 's sole contribution to this figure came when she torpedoed the tanker Powhatan 25 nautical miles ( 46 km ; 29 mi ) from North Rona in the Outer Hebrides . The 6 @,@ 117 @-@ ton ship , which was carrying fuel oil from Sabine , Texas to Kirkwall , bested Margam Abbey as U @-@ 66 's largest ship sunk when she went down with 36 of her crew . As was done with the master of Neath , Powhatan 's master was taken prisoner aboard U @-@ 66 . 
 Although the monthly total of tonnage sunk by all U @-@ boats had peaked in April , the losses were over 600 @,@ 000 tons in each of May and June . U @-@ 66 did not contribute to the May tally but , with her most successful month since April 1916 , added to the June figures . On 5 June , U @-@ 66 torpedoed the 3 @,@ 472 @-@ ton Italian steamer Amor which was on her way to Liverpool from Galveston ; Amor sank approximately 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ; 230 mi ) from Fastnet Rock . The same day , Manchester Miller , a 4 @,@ 234 @-@ ton steamer sailing from Philadelphia for Manchester with a load of cotton , was sunk about 10 nautical miles ( 19 km ; 12 mi ) away from Amor when she was hit by a torpedo from U @-@ 66 . Eight crewmen died in the attack ; the survivors , who included three Americans , were landed on 9 June . 
 Two days after the attacks on Amor and Manchester Miller , U @-@ 66 attacked two more British steamers . The 4 @,@ 329 @-@ ton <unk> , carrying wheat from New York to Manchester , was torpedoed and sunk 170 nautical miles ( 310 km ; 200 mi ) from Fastnet Rock . The cargo ship Cranmore , of 3 @,@ 157 tons , was headed to Manchester from Baltimore with a general cargo when torpedoed some 150 nautical miles ( 280 km ; 170 mi ) northwest of Fastnet . Though the ship was damaged , Cranmore 's crew was able to beach her ; the ship was later refloated and re @-@ entered service . 
 U @-@ 66 sank her largest ship , the 6 @,@ 583 @-@ ton British steamer Bay State on 10 June . The Warren Line cargo steamer had departed from Boston ( the capital of Massachusetts nicknamed , coincidentally , the " Bay State " ) with a $ 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 war cargo destined for Liverpool . U @-@ 66 intercepted the ship 250 nautical miles ( 460 km ; 290 mi ) northwest of Fastnet and sank her , but there were no casualties among her crew of 45 . Four days later , U @-@ 66 encountered the Norwegian bark Perfect , laden with grain , headed from Bahía Blanca for Copenhagen . Perfect , which had been built in 1877 , was dispatched by U @-@ 66 's deck gun at position 60 ° 58 ′ N 2 ° 18 ′ E , east of Shetland . 
 On 17 June , <unk> von Bothmer was replaced by Kptlt . Gerhard <unk> as commander of the U @-@ boat . U @-@ 66 was the first ( and ultimately only ) U @-@ boat command for the 31 @-@ year @-@ old <unk> , who had been a classmate of von Bothmer when both had joined the Kaiserliche Marine in April 1902 . On 9 July , U @-@ 66 sank her first ship under her new commander , when she sent the Spanish steamer <unk> to the bottom . The 1 @,@ 161 @-@ ton steamer was headed to Santander from Piteå and Bergen with a cargo of <unk> , when U @-@ 66 attacked her west of the Orkney Islands . 
 U @-@ 66 scored another success when she torpedoed and sank the outbound British steamer African Prince on 21 July 60 nautical miles ( 110 km ; 69 mi ) north @-@ northwest of Tory Island . The freighter — a Prince Line line @-@ mate of Stuart Prince , sunk by U @-@ 66 in March — was carrying china clay from Liverpool to Newport News . The same day , U @-@ 66 also sank the 1 @,@ 322 @-@ ton British sailing ship Harold about 5 nautical miles ( 9 @.@ 3 km ; 5 @.@ 8 mi ) from where African Prince went down . These two ships were the last sinkings credited to U @-@ 66 . During six successful patrols , U @-@ 66 had sunk 24 ships and seized a 25th as a prize , for a combined total tonnage of 69 @,@ 967 . 
 U @-@ 66 began her seventh and what was to be her final patrol on the morning of 2 September when she departed from Emden destined for operations in the North Channel . Shortly after noon on 3 September , U @-@ 66 reported a position in the North Sea that placed her beyond known British minefields , in what was her last known contact .

 = Paul G. Goebel = 
 Paul Gordon Goebel ( May 28 , 1901 – January 26 , 1988 ) was an American football end who played for the University of Michigan Wolverines from 1920 to 1922 . He was an All @-@ American in 1921 and was the team 's captain in 1922 . He played professional football from 1923 to 1926 with the Columbus Tigers , Chicago Bears , and New York Yankees . He was named to the NFL All @-@ Pro team in 1923 and 1924 . 
 After his football career ended , he operated a sporting good store in Grand Rapids . He officiated football games for the Big Ten Conference for 16 years and also served in the U.S. Navy on an aircraft carrier in World War II . He was active in Republican Party politics in Grand Rapids , Michigan , and was one of the organizers of a reform movement to oust the city 's political boss , Frank McKay . As an anti @-@ McKay reform candidate , Goebel was three times elected mayor of Grand Rapids in the 1950s . He was later elected to the University of Michigan Board of Regents , where he served from 1962 to 1970 . 
 Goebel also played an important role in the career of U.S. President Gerald R. Ford . Goebel was friends with Ford 's mother and stepfather and recommended Ford to head football coach Harry Kipke at the University of Michigan . When Ford returned from World War II , Goebel urged him to run for U.S. Congress and was part of the original Ford @-@ for @-@ Congress committee . Goebel was later the chairman of a committee formed in 1960 to name Ford as the Republican Party 's Vice Presidential candidate on the ticket with Richard Nixon . 
 = = Football player at the University of Michigan = = 
 Goebel enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1919 . He studied engineering and received his degree in 1923 . While at Michigan , he played football under head coach Fielding H. Yost . He played at the end where he developed a reputation as one of the country 's best forward pass receivers and as a tenacious defensive player . At 6 @-@ feet , 3 @-@ inches , Goebel was a tall player in his era . He started seven games in each of the 1920 and 1921 seasons at right end for the Wolverines , and was limited due to injury to five games in 1922 . In 1921 , he was chosen as an All @-@ American and was voted the captain of the 1922 team . Goebel also excelled as an honor student in the University 's engineering school . Goebel also earned the Big Ten Conference Medal of Honor for proficiency in academics and athletics . 
 = = = Goebel 's steel knee brace = = = 
 Prior to the 1922 season , Goebel " threw out his knee " and was fitted with a steel hinge – an early version of a knee brace . However , the steel contraption required oiling and overheated when the oil dried , thus limiting Goebel 's ability to play a complete game in 1922 . One 1922 newspaper article described Goebel 's knee brace this way : " To enable Goebel to play , the Michigan trainers devised a steel brace – a hinge . This apparatus attached above and below the knee gave Goebel fairly good leg action because of the hinge . Before each game , Goebel liberally oiled the hinge to get free action because of the hinge . " Goebel 's playing time was limited because " the constant action would dry the oil and then the steel would become so hot that Goebel could not continue playing . " During the 1922 game against Illinois , Goebel 's skin was burned by the steel . 
 = = = Dedication Day at Ohio Stadium = = = 
 Despite the limitations of the knee brace , Goebel led the Wolverines to victory in the first game played at Ohio Stadium . The official " Dedication Day " for the stadium was October 21 , 1922 , and the opponent was Michigan . Ohio State fans recalled for years afterward how Goebel and his teammate Harry Kipke managed to turn Dedication Day sour for the Buckeyes . Michigan shut out the Buckeyes , 19 @-@ 0 , with Goebel and Kipke scoring all the points . In the first period , Goebel blocked a punt and then kicked a long field goal from the 30 @-@ yard line for the game 's first points . He also penetrated into the Ohio State backfield in the second quarter to recover a fumble . As the game wore on , the Buckeyes " seemed to realize ( Goebel 's ) importance in the Michigan lineup because he was forced to take plenty of punishment . " Football writer Billy Evans described Goebel 's performance against Ohio State this way : 
 " No end in recent years has played a greater game ( than ) that which Goebel put up against Ohio State . For three periods Goebel was the mainspring of the Michigan eleven . He seemed to be in every play . It was always Goebel who was <unk> things up for State . No man could go through an entire game at the speed with which Goebel played in the first three quarters . It was beyond the power of any human being . With a few minutes to play in the third period the big fellow practically collapsed . Even when three or four of his teammates were carrying him off the field the old spirit was still there . He tried to induce his teammates that he was able to play , and tried to break away from their grasp , but the punch was gone and he was forced to give way as the big crowd cheered him to the echo . If any one man made possible the defeat of State by Michigan , it was Captain Paul Goebel . " 
 The rotunda at Ohio Stadium is painted with maize flowers on a blue background due to the outcome of the 1922 dedication game against , an enduring tribute to Goebel 's performance that day . Another writer summed up Goebel 's 1922 season : " Captain Paul Goebel of Michigan has commanded no little attention this season . He is fast and furious . His particular forte lies in his ability to not only plunge in and break up the interference of the opposing team , but after so doing , nail the man with the ball and down him in his tracks . "

 Goebel was particularly adept as a pass receiver . A 1923 wire service report in the Capital Times noted that Goebel was " considered one of the best ends in the country and his work on receiving forward passes hasn 't been excelled on the gridiron . " In what would become a tradition at Michigan 60 years later , Goebel was the first All @-@ American receiver at Michigan to wear the # 1 jersey . Others to follow that tradition are Anthony Carter , Derrick Alexander , David Terrell , and Braylon Edwards .

 Across the field from right end Goebel , Bernard Kirk played left end for the Wolverines in 1921 and 1922 . Kirk was a talented player who was set to graduate with Goebel in 1923 . However , Kirk died in an automobile accident on December 17 , 1922 . Goebel was a pall @-@ bearer along with Harry Kipke , Frank <unk> , and other Michigan football players at Kirk 's funeral in Ypsilanti , Michigan . Kirk had been a popular figure , and his funeral was covered widely in the national press , with Michigan Governor Alex Groesbeck , U @-@ M President Marion LeRoy Burton , and the coaches of the Big Ten Conference football teams all in attendance . 
 Goebel also served years later as a pall bearer at the funeral of his coach , Fielding H. Yost , in August 1946 .

 In February 1923 , Goebel refused an offer to become the head football coach at Wichita State University ( then known as Fairmount College ) , saying he planned to enter the engineering profession after graduation . Instead , Goebel opted to play professional football . He played professional football for the Columbus Tigers from 1923 @-@ 1925 , the Chicago Bears in 1925 , and the New York Yankees ( the football team ) in 1926 . In his first year in the NFL , Goebel played in all ten of the team 's games for the Columbus Tigers and was named to the All @-@ Pro Team . He threw one touchdown pass and caught another . He was credited with eight points scored including two extra points . 
 In 1924 , Goebel was again selected as an All @-@ Pro player with the Tigers , playing in ten games , making two touchdown receptions , and returning a fumble for a touchdown . In all , he was credited with three touchdowns and 18 points in 1924 . While playing end for the Columbus Tigers in 1924 , Goebel was involved in one of the oddest plays in NFL history . Goebel was the intended receiver of a forward pass , but the ball popped out of his arms and was snatched out of the air by Oscar Knop of the Chicago Bears . Knop began running for the goal line with the ball , but he was running the wrong way toward a safety . After running 30 yards , Knop was caught from behind and tackled by his teammate Ed Healey on the four @-@ yard line . 
 In 1926 , Goebel played for the Yankees alongside Red Grange . After the close of the 1926 football season , he went to Los Angeles where he took a minor role in Grange 's latest film . In May 1927 , Goebel announced his retirement from professional football . He said he would devote his time to the sporting goods store he operated in Grand Rapids . Goebel had been playing professional football every season since he finished at Michigan .

 After retiring from professional football , Goebel worked in his sporting good business in Grand Rapids , and also worked during football season as a game official for the Big Ten Conference . For 16 years between 1935 to 1952 , he was a Big Ten football official . He also officiated in Rose Bowl , Notre Dame , and Army @-@ Navy games . 
 Goebel played a role in a famous Ohio State @-@ Illinois game on November 13 , 1943 . The game was Paul Brown 's last game as coach of the Buckeyes . With the score tied 26 @-@ 26 , Ohio State threw an incomplete forward pass into the end zone as the gun sounded . The game appeared to have ended in a tie , the teams left the field , and the stands emptied . However , Ohio State assistant coach Ernie Godfrey had noticed Goebel , who was the head linesman , drop a handkerchief to signal a penalty . On hearing the gun sound , Goebel had picked up the handkerchief and put it back in his back pocket . Godfrey confronted Goebel , who conceded that Illinois was offsides . Twenty minutes later , the teams came back onto the field and the Buckeyes kicked a 33 @-@ yard field goal to give Coach Brown a 29 @-@ 26 win in his final game . 
 During World War II , Goebel served in the U.S. Navy as Lieutenant Commander on an aircraft carrier . His final game as an official was the 1952 Rose Bowl between Illinois and Stanford , in which he was the head linesman . 
 Goebel was also a fisherman , winning the title of Trout King at the National Trout Festival in 1949 . 
 = = Relationship with Gerald R. Ford = = 
 Goebel was a friend of Gerald R. Ford 's mother and stepfather in Grand Rapids . Goebel played an important role in guiding Ford to the University of Michigan . When Ford graduated from Grand Rapids South High School , Goebel recognized Ford ’ s ability as a football player and recommended him to his former teammate Harry Kipke , who had taken over as Michigan ’ s head football coach . Kipke recruited Ford , who became Michigan 's Most Valuable Player in 1934 . 
 In 1940 , Goebel was part of a citizen 's group in Grand Rapids seeking to overthrow Grand Rapids ' political boss , Frank McKay . McKay had dismissed Ford ’ s political interest in 1940 , and this led to a long political alliance between Goebel and Ford . Ford went to work with Goebel as part of the anti @-@ McKay citizen ’ s group . Together , they organized the " Home Front , " the purpose of which was to throw out Boss McKay . Ford was elected president of the organization , his first experience in political organizing . 
 Ford and Goebel both served in the U.S. Navy during World War II , and after the war , Ford urged Goebel to run for Congress against the incumbent , an isolationist named Barney <unk> . Goebel declined to run , but suggested to Ford that , " if you think he ought to be beaten , why don 't you run ? " Ford did run for Congress in 1948 , and Goebel was one of his close circle of early supporters , the original Ford @-@ for @-@ Congress group . Ford won the election and won re @-@ election for twelve more terms . In 1960 , Goebel was a leader in the movement to nominate Ford as the Vice Presidential candidate on the ticket with Richard Nixon , serving as Chairman of the " Ford for Vice President Committee " at the Republican National Convention in Chicago .

Ford delivered a speech at Calvin College in Grand Rapids the week before the election in which he said : " Paul Goebel I have known since he was just a lad . His dad knew me when I was back at South <unk> inspired if not very competent football player . But I have known the Goebel family a long time , and they are strong and they are tall , and they are the kind of people who are dedicated to public service . Paul , Jr .

 = Marquette Building ( Chicago ) = 
 The Marquette Building , completed in 1895 , is a Chicago landmark that was built by the George A. Fuller Company and designed by architects Holabird & Roche . The building is currently owned by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation . It is located in the community area known as the " Loop " in Cook County , Illinois , United States . 
 The building was one of the early steel frame skyscrapers of its day , and is considered one of the best examples of the Chicago School of architecture . The building originally had a reddish , terra cotta exterior that is now somewhat blackened due to decades of Loop soot . It is noted both for its then cutting edge frame and its ornate interior . 
 Since being built , the building has received numerous awards and honors . It was designated a Chicago Landmark on June 9 , 1975 , and it is considered an architectural masterpiece . It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 17 , 1973 . It was a named a National Historic Landmark on January 7 , 1976 . The building 's preservation has been a major focus of the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois . The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation completed an extensive four @-@ year restoration in 2006 . 
 = = History = = 
 The building was named after Father Jacques Marquette , the first European settler in Chicago , who explored the Chicago region in 1674 and wintered in the area for the 1674 @-@ 5 winter season . It was designed by William Holabird and Martin Roche , with <unk> T. Purdy , architects of the firm Holabird & Roche . 
 In the 1930s the building was the downtown headquarters for over 30 railroad companies . Around 1950 , the terra @-@ cotta cornice was removed from the Marquette Building when an additional story was added . The building has been in continuous use as an office building since its construction . 
 In 1977 , Banker 's Life and Casualty Company , owned by John D. MacArthur , acquired the Marquette Building . After his death in 1978 , the building became the headquarters for the MacArthur Foundation , which bears his name . 
 The lobby of the Marquette Building connects with the D.H. Burnham & Company – designed Edison Building to the west , providing a pedway from Dearborn to Clark . After the September 11 , 2001 attacks , many downtown buildings closed to the public , which eliminated warm , dry , indoor walking routes providing shortcuts through full city blocks , but the Marquette Building did not . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The building features several distinct elements that have earned it honors as a Chicago Landmark , a National Historic Landmark , and a National Register Historic Place . It is considered an exemplary model of the Chicago School of Architecture . The architects , Holabird & Roche , used trademark long horizontal bay " Chicago windows " on the Marquette Building . These are large panes of glass flanked by narrow sash windows . The grid @-@ like window frames and spandrels are facilitated by the steel structure which enables non @-@ load @-@ bearing masonry walls . This was one of the first steel framed skyscrapers . Wave @-@ like moldings decorate the façade , which is made of horizontally banded brown terra cotta . The building is built around a central light court featuring an ornate , two @-@ story lobby . 
 The ensemble of mosaics , sculptures , and bronze of the Marquette Building entry and interior honors Jacques Marquette ’ s 1674 @-@ 5 expedition . Four bas relief panels over the main entrance by sculptor Hermon Atkins MacNeil show different scenes from Marquette 's trip through the Great Lakes region , ending with one depicting his burial . The revolving door panels feature carvings of panther 's heads . The hexagonal railing around the lobby atrium is decorated with a mosaic frieze by the Tiffany studio depicting events in the life of Jacques Marquette , his exploration of Illinois , and Native Americans he met . The mosaics are by Louis Comfort Tiffany and his chief designer and art director , Jacob Adolph Holzer ; they contain panels of <unk> Tiffany glass , mother @-@ of @-@ pearl , and semi @-@ precious stones .

 The earliest known historical traces of cotton were found at Mehrgarh near the city of Quetta , making Pakistan one of the first regions of cotton cultivation . Cotton was discovered in threads on a copper bead at a burial site dated to the Neolithic period ( 6000 BC ) . The mineralised threads were subject to metallurgical analysis with a combination of a reflected @-@ light microscope and a scanning electron microscope , revealing that they were of cotton ( genus Gossypium ) . Cotton cultivation became more widespread during the Indus Valley Civilisation , which covered parts of present day eastern Pakistan and northwestern India . <unk> evidence of seeds has been traced to 5000 BC in Mehrgarh , though it is not clear if they belonged to a wild or cultivated variety . Use of cotton cloth in the Indus Valley cities of Mohenjo @-@ daro and Harappa dates to 2 @,@ 500 BC . Cotton pollen has been recorded at <unk> . At Harappa ( Mature Harappan period 2500 @-@ 2000 BC ) , evidence of cotton threads has been found tied to the handle of a mirror , an antiquity from a female burial site , and around a copper razor . There is also much other evidence of cotton in some form , such as <unk> ( flowering plant ) pollen type , similar to Gossypium in <unk> ( Mature Harappan period , 2500 @-@ 2000 BC ) ; as seeds at <unk> ( Mature Harappan , 2200 @-@ 1900 BC ) , <unk> ( Late Harappan , 1900 @-@ 1400 BC ) , <unk> , <unk> ( Late Harappan , 2 @,@ 000 @-@ 1 @,@ 700 BC ) , <unk> <unk> and Gorakhpur ( 1300 @-@ 800 BC ) ; as fibres in Late Ochre @-@ Coloured Pottery at <unk> ( 1200 @-@ 700 BC ) ; and in <unk> as seeds and fragments of the Early Iron Age ( 950 @-@ 900 BC ) .

 Cotton is purely a cellulose fibre crop , one of the four major crops in the country , and is known by popular epithets as “ King cotton ” and “ white gold ” . It forms the primary input for the textile industry of Pakistan . 
 Cotton is integral to Pakistan 's economy . According to an analysis in the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service report of 2015 , it is grown as an industrial crop in 15 % of the nation 's land . It is grown during the monsoon months of May to August , known as the <unk> period . It is also grown on a smaller scale between February and April . 
 Cotton is grown mostly in the two provinces of Punjab and Sindh , with the former accounting for 79 % and the latter for 20 % of the nation 's cotton growing land . It is also grown in Khyber <unk> <unk> ( KPK ) and Balochistan provinces . The total land area of cotton cultivation was reported as 2 @,@ 950 @,@ 000 hectares ( 7 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 acres ) during the 2014 – 15 growing season . Generally , small farmers with land holdings less than 5 hectares ( 12 acres ) in size form the largest group of growers ; farmers holding less than 2 hectares ( 4 @.@ 9 acres ) account for 50 % of the farms . Land holdings with 25 hectares ( 62 acres ) under cotton cultivation form less than 2 % of farms . According to a 2013 estimate , there were 1 @.@ 6 million farmers ( out of a total of 5 million in all sectors ) engaged in cotton farming , growing more than 3 million hectares . 
 = = Varieties = = 
 Farmers have widely adopted Bacillus thuringiensis ( Bt ) cotton since its first trial in Sindh province in 2002 . It is now used in 95 % of the area . The Punjab Seed Council has approved the use of 18 Bt cotton and non @-@ Bt varieties for cultivation . These are : 12 BT varieties FH @-@ 114 , CIM @-@ 598 , <unk> @-@ 009 , A @-@ one , BH @-@ 167 , <unk> @-@ 852 , CIM @-@ 573 , <unk> @-@ 317 , <unk> @-@ 1 , NS @-@ 141 , IR @-@ <unk> @-@ 3 , <unk> @-@ 886 , and six non @-@ BT varieties <unk> − 115 , FH @-@ 941 , FH @-@ 942 , IR @-@ 1524 , Ali Akbar @-@ 802 and <unk> @-@ 121 . In Sindh province , local Sindh varieties of cotton are also grown in about 40 % of the area . They are generally planted from April to July , and harvested during August – December . 
 = = Production = = 
 Cotton serves as the base for the nation 's industrial sector . Production of cotton was reported at a record high of 15 million bales of 470 lbs each in the form of <unk> ( seed cotton ) during 2014 – 15 ; this was an 11 % increase compared to the previous season ( 2013 – 14 ) . Its phenomenal growth was from 1 @.@ 38 million bales in 1961 to 11 @.@ 138 million bales in 2014 , with the estimated 2014 – 15 figures showing a further increase to 15 million bales . Between 1980 – 81 and 1990 – 91 , the growth in production was rapid , with production rising from 0 @.@ 70 million to 2 @.@ 2 million tonnes , which was called the " magic year " of Pakistan 's cotton industry . This was attributed to better pest control measures , use of improved seed types and increased use of fertilisers . The cotton and textile industries are integrated and account for 1 @,@ 000 <unk> , 425 textile mills , and 300 cottonseed crushers and oil refiners . Cotton hybrids , created by crossing the Bt gene into traditional varieties , have been developed by local firms dealing with seeds . In Sindh province cotton is grown in more than one million acres in the districts of <unk> , Hyderabad , <unk> , Mirpur Khas , <unk> Feroz , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Thatta and Umar Kot . 
 In terms of production , Pakistan is at the fourth position among the cotton growers of the world ; the first three are China , India and the United States , in that order Raw cotton exported from Pakistan holds third position in the world as per records of 2012 @-@ 13 . Consumption @-@ wise it holds the fourth position ( about 30 and 40 per cent of its production ) . It is the largest exporter of cotton yarn . 
 Cotton produced within the country is of medium staple . Hence long staple cotton is imported to produce quality fabrics for export . Medium staple cotton , also called standard medium @-@ staple cotton is American Upland type with staple length varying from about 1 @.@ 3 – 3 @.@ 3 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 51 – 1 @.@ 30 in ) . Long @-@ staple cottons have relatively longer fibre , are expensive and used mostly to make fine fabrics , yarns , and hosiery . The country 's economic development is largely dependent on the cotton industry and its related textile sector , and this has given a principal status to cotton in the country . Apart from use in textiles in the form of cotton lint , yarn , thread , cloth , and garments , its seeds are used for oil extraction .

 Though a bio @-@ safety regulatory system was part of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan that " devolved " several functions to the provinces , the system is still unclear with regard to regulators who can oversee the approval of new seed technologies . In this context the three regulatory acts which are under approval stage are the Plant Breeders ’ Rights Act , Amendments to the 1976 Seed Act , and the <unk> Law . According to the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service report of 2015 , passage of these laws is crucial to the introduction of new biotech events . 
 = Gordon Ramsay Plane Food = 
 Gordon Ramsay Plane Food is a restaurant owned by chef Gordon Ramsay and located within Terminal 5 of Heathrow Airport , London . The restaurant cost £ 2 @.@ 5 million to build and due to its location within the airside area of the airport , there are restrictions on the use of gas and the types of cutlery which may be used . It opened in 2008 alongside the rest of Terminal 5 , and with several other Ramsay @-@ related openings that year . Ramsay said that he aimed to keep the menu lean without the use of heavy sauces , and menus are also offered for quick dining as well as takeaway cool boxes which contain a three course meal to be eaten on a plane . 
 Critics have been mostly positive , although one initial poor review by Jan Moir was picked up by the mainstream media . The concept of the cool boxes was also praised . It was Ramsay 's first airport @-@ based restaurant , and in 2013 he announced that he was planning to take the concept to a number of airports within the United States . 
 = = Description = = 
 Gordon Ramsay Plane Food is located on the sixth floor of Terminal 5 within Heathrow Airport , London , next to the <unk> restaurant . It is airside , meaning that only passengers who are about to go on a flight can access Plane Food . The restaurant cost £ 2 @.@ 5 million to set up , and Ramsay signed an initial lease for ten years with the airport . The chef patron of the restaurant is Stuart Giles , who had previously worked at Ramsay 's Boxwood Cafe . 
 The interior is decorated with a marble bar , above which hangs a painting by Barnaby Gorton worth £ 90 @,@ 000 . There are large windows at one end of the restaurant , which look out onto the airport itself . The restaurant has a seating capacity for 175 diners . 
 As with all restaurants at Terminal 5 , Plane Food cannot use gas equipment due to safety reasons and so electric ovens and <unk> are used instead as well as a single microwave . The cutlery is also a standard airport size so that the knives cannot be used as weapons . Ramsay requires that staff who working at Plane Food must gain work experience in another one of his restaurants first . 
 = = = Menu = = = 
 Pricing is similar to other restaurants owned by Ramsay , and it is intended to bring a fine dining experience out of specialist airport lounges and make it available to any traveller . Starters include a pea , leek and goat cheese tart , while mains include sea bass which is steamed and served alongside lemongrass and white asparagus . Chocolate fondue with marshmallows and waffles are among the options for dessert as well as a <unk> glory . Traditional fine dining dishes are also included on the menu , such as <unk> caviar . Ramsay said in interviews around the launch of the restaurant that he aimed to keep " it all very lean , lean , lean . No heavy sauces " . He compared the menu to a cross between The Ivy , his own Boxwood Cafe and The Wolseley . A specific menu is offered for quick dining , called " Plane Fast " . This has multiple @-@ course meals which aim to be served within 25 minutes . 
 The restaurant also sells takeaway cool boxes designed to be taken on flights to eat instead of airline food . There are up to four choices for each of three courses . Options include a tiger prawn and watercress salad , and roast beef with truffle with a green bean salad . Desserts include a chocolate and pecan brownie with crème Chantilly .

 Plane Food was announced in December 2007 to launch upon the opening of Heathrow Airport 's new Terminal 5 on 27 March 2008 . It was Gordon Ramsay 's ninth restaurant opening in London , and his first in an airport . It was opened around the same time as Ramsay 's first restaurant in France , Gordon Ramsay au Trianon , located within the Palace of Versailles . He also expanded his restaurant empire in other areas during 2008 , with Murano ( alongside Angela Hartnett ) , York & Albany and Maze Grill also opening . Partly due to the delays in opening the terminal , the restaurant made a loss of £ 780 @,@ 767 during the first year . 
 During 2009 , Ramsay had financial issues with tax payments . A liquidation petition was placed by HM Revenue and Customs against Plane Food , Maze , Restaurant Gordon Ramsay and The Narrow . He was given two weeks to pay the tax debts accumulated by Plane Food . It was announced on 10 December that he had achieved this and the restaurant remained open . His 2010 opening , Bread Street Kitchen , was based on the same concept as Plane Food , as its location within the One New Change office and retail development created a similar need to cater for quick dining and a high volume of single diners . 
 In 2013 , Ramsay announced that he plans to expand the Plane Food concept to several sites in the United States including Chicago O 'Hare International Airport , and airports at Los Angeles , Las Vegas and New York . A partnership was also formed during that year with No.1 Traveller to provide a lounge experience within Terminal 5 for passengers . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Food critic Jan Moir was the first to review the restaurant after opening , after some five hours on the first day . She didn 't think that the quality of the food was enough to attract first and executive class passengers . Moir was also concerned that the pricing was too expensive for those travelling in economy . She said that the required use of electric stoves instead of gas resulted in her steak resembling a " parched leather shoe rotting in the rain " . Jasper Gerard , in his review for The Daily Telegraph said that he enjoyed the caviar and the sea bass dishes , but didn 't like the vegetable accompaniments . He criticised negative reviews of the restaurant , saying " Are they comparing like with like ? Heathrow will never be Royal Hospital Ro [ ad ] , Ramsay 's Chelsea <unk> house , but it 's hardly a kitchen nightmare " . 
 Tam Cowan also reviewed it shortly after opening for the Daily Record . He gave it a score of 20 out of 25 , finding it difficult to believe that food of such good quality was being served inside an airport . He called a macaroni gratin with mushrooms and Parmigiano @-@ Reggiano cheese " fantastic " and said that an apple crumble was " awesome " . Mark <unk> , in his review of the restaurant for the Evening Standard in 2009 , was not expecting much from the restaurant . However , he called his Caesar salad starter a " revelation " and said that the chocolate brownie was " dense , dark and rich " . Although he was disappointed with the polenta chips , he said overall that the food was " utterly sublime " and he suggested that Ramsay should expand the concept to train stations across London . In 2012 , John Walsh wrote about Jamie Oliver 's restaurant at Gatwick Airport , saying that Ramsay 's Plane Food had " pioneered the concept of non @-@ revolting airport food " . 
 Tim Clark , writing for the Daily Mail , praised the takeaway box concept , saying that to " tuck into a smoked salmon and cream cheese sandwich with apple and walnut salad was a delight " . However , he said that the <unk> monsieur was bland and he didn 't like the lack of a drink . He thought that it was a value for money option and was the " first real stab at giving passengers a choice while they are flying . " Chris Haslam reviewed a number of in @-@ flight meal options on various airlines as well as Plane Food in an article for the Sunday Times . He gave it a score of 7 out of 10 , saying about the takeaway cool boxes that " as long as it lasts , it 's like being in business class " . 
 = Stars ( M. C. Escher ) = 
 Stars is a wood engraving print created by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher in 1948 , depicting two chameleons in a polyhedral cage floating through space . 
 Although the compound of three octahedra used for the central cage in Stars had been studied before in mathematics , it was most likely invented independently for this image by Escher without reference to those studies . Escher used similar compound polyhedral forms in several other works , including Crystal ( 1947 ) , Study for Stars ( 1948 ) , Double Planetoid ( 1949 ) , and Waterfall ( 1961 ) . 
 The design for Stars was likely influenced by Escher 's own interest in both geometry and astronomy , by a long history of using geometric forms to model the heavens , and by a drawing style used by Leonardo da Vinci . Commentators have interpreted the cage 's compound shape as a reference to double and triple stars in astronomy , or to twinned crystals in crystallography . The image contrasts the celestial order of its polyhedral shapes with the more chaotic forms of biology . 
 Prints of Stars belong to the permanent collections of major museums including the Rijksmuseum , the National Gallery of Art , and the National Gallery of Canada . 
 = = Description = = 
 Stars is a wood engraving print ; that is , it was produced by carving the artwork into the end grain of a block of wood ( unlike a woodcut which uses the side grain ) , and then using this block to print the image . It was created by Escher in October 1948 . Although most published copies of Stars are monochromatic , with white artwork against a black background , the copy in the National Gallery of Canada is tinted in different shades of turquoise , yellow , green , and pale pink . 
 The print depicts a hollowed @-@ out compound of three octahedra , a polyhedral compound composed of three interlocking regular octahedra , floating in space . Numerous other polyhedra and polyhedral compounds float in the background ; the four largest are , on the upper left , the compound of cube and octahedron ; on the upper right , the stella octangula ; on the lower left , a compound of two cubes ; and on the lower right , a solid version of the same octahedron 3 @-@ compound . The smaller polyhedra visible within the print also include all of the five Platonic solids and the rhombic dodecahedron . In order to depict polyhedra accurately , Escher made models of them from cardboard . 
 Two chameleons are contained within the cage @-@ like shape of the central compound ; Escher writes that they were chosen as its inhabitants " because they are able to cling by their legs and tails to the beams of their cage as it swirls through space " . The chameleon on the left sticks out his tongue , perhaps in commentary ; H. S. M. Coxeter observes that the tongue has an unusual spiral @-@ shaped tip . 
 = = Influences = = 
 Escher 's interest in geometry is well known , but he was also an avid amateur astronomer , and in the early 1940s he became a member of the Dutch Association for Meteorology and Astronomy . He owned a 6 cm refracting telescope , and recorded several observations of binary stars . 
 The use of polyhedra to model heavenly bodies can be traced back to Plato , who in the Timaeus identified the regular dodecahedron with the shape of the heavens and its twelve faces with the constellations of the zodiac . Later , Johannes Kepler theorized that the distribution of distances of the planets from the sun could be explained by the shapes of the five Platonic solids , nested within each other . Escher kept a model of this system of nested polyhedra , and regularly depicted polyhedra in his artworks relating to astronomy and other worlds . 
 Escher learned his wood engraving technique from Samuel <unk> de Mesquita . He illustrated the octahedral compound of Stars in the beveled wire @-@ frame style that had been used by Leonardo da Vinci in his illustrations for Luca Pacioli 's 1509 book , De divina proportione . 
 The stella octangula ( Latin for " eight @-@ pointed star " ) in the upper right of Stars was first described by Pacioli , and later rediscovered by Kepler , who gave it its astronomical name . H. S. M. Coxeter reports that the shape of the central chameleon cage in Stars had previously been described in 1900 by Max Brückner , whose book <unk> und <unk> includes a photograph of a model of the same shape . However , Escher was not aware of this reference and Coxeter writes that " It is remarkable that Escher , without any knowledge of algebra or analytic geometry , was able to rediscover this highly symmetrical figure . " 
 = = Analysis = = 
 Martin Beech interprets the many polyhedral compounds within Stars as corresponding to double stars and triple star systems in astronomy . Beech writes that , for Escher , the mathematical orderliness of polyhedra depicts the " stability and timeless quality " of the heavens , and similarly Marianne L. <unk> writes that Stars " celebrates Escher 's identification with Johannes Kepler 's neo @-@ Platonic belief in an underlying mathematical order in the universe " . 
 Alternatively , Howard W. Jaffe interprets the polyhedral forms in Stars <unk> , as " brilliantly faceted jewels " floating through space , with its compound polyhedra representing crystal twinning . However , R. A. Dunlap points out the contrast between the order of the polyhedral forms and the more chaotic biological nature of the chameleons inhabiting them . In the same vein , Beech observes that the stars themselves convey tension between order and chaos : despite their symmetric shapes , the stars are scattered apparently at random , and vary haphazardly from each other . As Escher himself wrote about the central chameleon cage , " I shouldn 't be surprised if it wobbles a bit . " 
 = = Related works = = 
 A closely related woodcut , Study for Stars , completed in August 1948 , depicts wireframe versions of several of the same polyhedra and polyhedral compounds , floating in black within a square composition , but without the chameleons . The largest polyhedron shown in Study for Stars , a stellated rhombic dodecahedron , is also one of two polyhedra depicted prominently in Escher 's 1961 print Waterfall . 
 The stella octangula , a compound of two tetrahedra that appears in the upper right of Stars , also forms the central shape of another of Escher 's astronomical works , Double Planetoid ( 1949 ) . The compound of cube and octahedron in the upper left was used earlier by Escher , in Crystal ( 1947 ) . 
 Escher 's later work Four Regular Solids ( <unk> Figure ) returned to the theme of polyhedral compounds , depicting a more explicitly Keplerian form in which the compound of the cube and octahedron is nested within the compound of the dodecahedron and icosahedron .

 Stars was used as cover art for the 1962 anthology Best Fantasy Stories edited by Brian Aldiss , and for a 1971 Italian edition of occult guidebook The Morning of the Magicians . It also formed the frontispiece for a 1996 textbook on crystallography . 
 As well as being exhibited in the Escher Museum , copies of Stars are in the permanent collections of the Rijksmuseum , National Gallery of Art , Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum and the National Gallery of Canada .

 " Apocrypha " was the first mythology @-@ centered episode to be directed by Manners , and made use of a mixture of physical and digital effects to create the episode 's antagonistic black oil . The episode 's sets were also augmented with digital effects , amplifying what could be constructed within the given budget . 
 = = Plot = = 
 On August 19 , 1953 , a burned crewman talks to three government agents about his experience on the submarine Zeus Faber , completing the story told in the previous episode . He explains that he and other crew members were locked in with their captain , who was infected by the black oil . After being knocked out from behind , the black oil leaves the captain 's body and exits via a grate into the sea . It is revealed that Bill Mulder and the Smoking Man are two of the agents who are interviewing the crewman . 
 In the present , Fox Mulder and Alex Krycek return to the United States , but are run off the road by another vehicle . The assailants attempt to apprehend Krycek , but are severely injured when he emits a flashing light . The Smoking Man sees their bodies and orders their destruction . Mulder , who was knocked unconscious in the crash , awakens in the hospital . Dana Scully tells Mulder about Walter Skinner 's condition , and says that an analysis of saliva has identified his shooter as the same person who killed her sister Melissa . 
 The Syndicate meets to discuss the events surrounding the Piper Maru and realize someone is leaking information . Meanwhile , Skinner tells Scully that he recognizes his shooter as the man who was with Krycek when the digital tape was stolen from him . Mulder believes that the oil found on the diving suit and Gauthier is a medium used by an alien to transfer from body to body , and that Krycek is currently occupied by it . Mulder and the Lone Gunmen use Krycek 's key to recover the tape from a locker at an ice rink , but Mulder finds the case empty . Krycek returns the tape to the Smoking Man in exchange for the location of the recovered UFO . 
 As Luis Cardinal is identified as Skinner 's shooter , the Syndicate admonishes the Smoking Man for moving the UFO to a new location . By rubbing a pencil over the envelope containing the tape case , Mulder finds a phone number which connects him to the Syndicate 's office . Mulder speaks to the Well @-@ Manicured Man , who agrees to meet with him . The Well @-@ Manicured Man tells Mulder that a UFO was sunk during World War II and that a cover story of a sunken atomic bomb was used to cover up its attempted recovery . He reveals that anyone can be gotten to , causing Mulder to ask Scully to check on Skinner . 
 Scully accompanies Skinner as he is being transported in an ambulance . When Cardinal attempts to break in , she tracks him down and arrests him . Cardinal tells her that Krycek is headed to an abandoned missile silo in Black Crow , North Dakota . There , the agents are captured by the Smoking Man 's men and are escorted away . Deep inside , Krycek sits atop the UFO and coughs out the black oil , which seeps into the ship . Skinner recovers and returns to work . Mulder sees Scully at Melissa 's grave , explaining that Cardinal was found dead in his cell . Meanwhile , Krycek is trapped within the silo , banging on the door in an attempt to be let out . 
 = = Production = = 
 Conception of the episode was based around a visual image series creator Chris Carter had wanted to include in a script " since the beginning of the show " . The image was of a black @-@ and @-@ white flashback taking place in a submarine . 
 The episode 's title is a reference to Biblical apocrypha , which series creator Chris Carter felt was appropriate to the episode 's thematic concerns — hidden documents and truths not brought to light . Director Kim Manners had directed a number of stand alone " monster of the week " episodes , but this was his first mythology @-@ centered episode . Manners explained that " there is some individual creative contribution from the directors " in stand @-@ alone episodes , but that with mythology episodes " what you need to as a director is to be sure that the performances are there ... and that the yarn is presented in its cleanest and most interesting fashion " . 
 Nicholas Lea was fitted with a mask with tubes for the scene where the alien black oil leaves his body . Lea said filming the scene was horrible , and the scene ended up having to be filmed again a few days later . The similar scene from the start of the episode with the submarine captain was accomplished with a dummy head . The depiction of the oil in this scene was originally filmed using a magnetic fluid pulled along with magnets , although the end result of this was deemed not be " menacing " enough , and looked " a little bit comic " . To fix this , the sound stage used to represent the submarine 's interior was rebuilt so it could be rocked back and forth , with the movement being used to guide the flow of a different liquid . This effect was then enhanced digitally in post @-@ production . The black oil effect over people 's eyes was accomplished by inserting the footage digitally in post production . 
 The missile silo used for the episode 's climactic scene was incomplete when the scene was filmed , as the crew did not have enough time or money left to complete the set . The crew built the incomplete silo on a sound stage around a completed spacecraft prop , and were able to digitally extend the set with computer generated interiors to give the impression of a much larger silo . Exterior shots of the silo building were also enhanced digitally , with various buildings and machinery created with computer generated imagery and composited into the exterior shots .

 Alien Soldier is a 1995 side @-@ scrolling run and gun video game developed by Treasure for the Mega Drive . Retail copies were released in Japan and PAL territories while in North America it was only available exclusively via the Sega Channel cable service . The story follows a powerful being named Epsilon @-@ Eagle , who after being nearly killed becomes determined to avenge his near death and save his planet . The character has a variety of weapons and moves that the player must master to complete the game . Many gameplay ideas are borrowed from Treasure 's earlier Mega Drive release , Gunstar Heroes . However , Alien Soldier puts an emphasis on challenging boss fights with short and easy levels serving as downtime in @-@ between . 
 Development lasted two years and was led by Hideyuki Suganami , who originally wanted to make the entire game himself but ultimately received support . He had ambitious plans for Alien Soldier but in order to meet his deadline , the game was released at roughly half @-@ completion . Alien Soldier was released towards the end of the Mega Drive 's lifecycle and was explicitly targeted for " hardcore " Mega Drive gamers . Critics have praised the game for its graphics , soundtrack , and overall intensity , recommending it for fans of Gunstar Heroes and the run and gun genre . Some negative critique was directed towards the hard difficulty , steep learning curve , and unorthodox gameplay . It was ported to the PlayStation 2 in Japan , and also re @-@ released worldwide on the Wii Virtual Console and Steam . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Alien Soldier is a side @-@ scrolling run and gun video game in which the player controls the main character , Epsilon @-@ Eagle , through 25 stages and 31 bosses . The gameplay has been compared heavily to Gunstar Heroes ; however , putting a much larger emphasis on boss fights , and lacking any 2 @-@ player option . The stages are notably short , populated with weak enemies to serve as downtime between the more difficult boss battles . There are two difficulties in the game , " <unk> " and " <unk> " . Enemies on the hard setting are only slightly more difficult ; however , there are no passwords or unlimited continues as in the easy mode . 
 Epsilon @-@ Eagle can run , double jump , hover in the air , and use six different types of weapons . Only four can be equipped at any given time , but the player may choose which weapons they would like to equip before the game starts . Each gun has its own ammunition bar which can be replenished ; if it 's depleted the player will be left with a little firepower . The player can also perform a dash across the screen , which when at full health , will become a deadly move called " Phoenix Force " that will damage any enemies in its path . There is also a counter move , that if timed properly , will change enemy bullets into health . Epsilon @-@ Eagle can attack in either fixed @-@ fire or free @-@ moving styles .

 The premise of Alien Soldier is provided with a long text scroll at the start of the game . After the game has begun , it is not referred to again . In the year 2015 , the " A @-@ Humans " of " A @-@ Earth " have created genetically engineered A @-@ Humans capable of super intelligence and strength , as well as parasitic co @-@ existence with machinery and animals , particularly humans . A terrorist organization known as " Scarlet " rose up within this race and sought to dominate the rest of the A @-@ Humans and A @-@ Earth by locking the planet down and keeping anyone else out . During the height of Scarlet 's power , an assassination attempt on the group 's leader , Epsilon @-@ Eagle , was carried out by a special forces group . Scarlet fought back with their powers , and the battle somehow breached the space @-@ time continuum . Epsilon was gravely injured and cast somewhere into the continuum . 
 Seemingly gone forever , another Scarlet member known as Xi @-@ Tiger took control of the organization . Under his rule , Scarlet became too brutal even for themselves , and they called for Epsilon to reclaim his position . More or less isolated from the rest of the group , Xi sought to find and assassinate Epsilon himself . He planned an attack on an A @-@ Human research laboratory , where children with special abilities had been kidnapped and experimented on . Upon arriving , Xi @-@ Tiger sensed the presence of Epsilon in one of the boys . However , he was unsure because he couldn 't pinpoint the evil from Epsilon , who had entered the boy 's body and was now living as a parasite . Xi @-@ Tiger took a young girl hostage and threatened to kill her unless Epsilon revealed himself . The boy flew into a rage and morphed his body into Epsilon himself . Xi seemed to sense this strange power , and in fear , killed the girl and fled . Epsilon had completely split his dual personality apart ; with both " good " and " evil " <unk> now chasing after Xi @-@ Tiger . 
 = = Development and release = = 
 Development of Alien Soldier lasted two years and was led by Hideyuki Suganami , who from the start wanted to make the entire game himself . Despite 32 @-@ bit fifth generation hardware already on the market , he chose to program the game for the 16 @-@ bit Mega Drive , claiming that he may have been too captivated by the idea of making an " action shooting " game . Treasure explicitly targeted the game for " hardcore " Mega Drive players and designed its difficulty and end @-@ game scoring methods with this in mind . 
 Suganami was deeply invested in Alien Soldier and devoted a lot of personal time to developing it . He originally had ambitious plans for a large backstory , but in order to make their deadline of January 3 , 1995 , the majority of it was cut from the game . As the deadline approached , he came to realize he would not be able to complete Alien Soldier himself , and so additional staff were added to provide him support . He worked overtime during the New Years holidays in order to complete the game . The market for the Mega Drive was quickly shrinking , and the game had to be released in a half @-@ finished state . After its release , Suganami wished he continued working on it , believing he could have improved on the story and graphics . 
 Alien Soldier was released in 1995 on a physical cartridge format in Australia , Europe and Japan . In North America , the game was delivered exclusively through the Sega Channel cable service . The game 's first re @-@ release was in Japan on the PlayStation 2 as part of the Sega Ages 2500 : Gunstar Heroes Treasure Box compilation . Alien Soldier was released again worldwide in fall 2007 on the Wii via the Virtual Console download service , and again for Microsoft Windows on Steam on January 6 , 2011 .

 For its original Mega Drive release , Famitsu provided Alien Soldier with a score of 24 out of 40 . Frank Provo of GameSpot reviewed the Wii Virtual Console release in 2007 , citing the excellent graphics , sound , and general intensity of the game . He noted initial difficulty adjusting to the controls and game design . However , once accustomed , he said , " you start totally feeling what it must be like to be an army of one trading firepower with some of the universe 's largest , most elaborate creatures . That 's a great feeling . " Lucas M. Thomas of IGN noted the game 's many similarities to Gunstar Heroes and recommended Alien Soldier to those who enjoyed it . " Alien Soldier is a long @-@ lost piece of Treasure 's action gaming legacy , " said Thomas . " It 's got the fast @-@ firing , high @-@ energy , overly @-@ explosive intensity that fans of the company have come to expect . " Darren Calvert of Nintendo Life described the graphics and animation as some of the best on the Mega Drive . He found the game difficult , but still enjoyable for fans of the run and gun genre . Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer described the game as " manically @-@ paced " and " bizarrely creative " while also providing a disclaimer that it 's " really hectic and difficult if you 're not into this sort of thing .

 = Murder of Leigh Leigh = 
 Leigh Leigh , born Leigh <unk> Mears , was a 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl from Fern Bay , on the east coast of Australia , who was murdered on November 3 , 1989 . While attending a 16 @-@ year @-@ old boy 's birthday party at Stockton Beach , Leigh was assaulted by a group of boys after she returned distressed from a sexual encounter on the beach that a reviewing judge later called non @-@ consensual . After being kicked and spat on by the group , Leigh left the party . Her naked body was found in the sand dunes nearby the following morning , with severe genital damage and a crushed skull . 
 Matthew Grant Webster , an 18 @-@ year @-@ old who acted as a bouncer at the event , pleaded guilty to her murder and was sentenced to 20 years in prison with a 14 @-@ year non @-@ parole period . He was released on parole in June 2004 , after serving 14 ½ years . Guy Charles Wilson , the other bouncer and only other person aged over 18 at the party , pleaded guilty to assault ; a third male ( aged 15 ) pleaded guilty to having sex with a minor . The investigation of Leigh 's murder proved controversial , however , as several people who admitted to various crimes , including assaulting Leigh , were never charged ; nor was anyone ever charged with her sexual assault . Webster 's confession did not match the forensic evidence . The murder investigation was reviewed by the New South Wales Crime Commission in 1996 , and by the Police Integrity Commission in 1998 , with the latter recommending the dismissal of the detective in charge of the investigation . 
 Leigh 's murder received considerable attention in the media . Initially focusing on her sexual assault and murder , media attention later concentrated more on the lack of parental supervision and the drugs and alcohol at the party , and on Leigh 's sexuality . The media coverage of the murder has been cited as an example of blaming the victim . Leigh 's murder inspired a theatrical play entitled A Property of the Clan , which was later revised and renamed Blackrock , as well as a feature film of the same name . 
 = = Background = = 
 Leigh Leigh , born Leigh <unk> Mears on 24 July 1975 , was the daughter of Robyn Lynne Maunsell and Robert William Mears . Leigh 's grandmother said that Leigh lived with her between the ages of about four and seven , though she did not disclose reasons for this living arrangement . Leigh 's parents divorced when she was about seven years old . She moved back to live with her mother after her sister Jessie was born in 1983 ; her surname was subsequently changed to Leigh as this was the surname of her sister 's father . At the time of her death she lived with her sister , mother and stepfather Brad Shearman on Fullerton Road , Fern Bay , having moved there nine months earlier from a housing commission flat near the Stockton ferry terminal . Leigh was a Year Eight student at Newcastle High School who enjoyed school , according to her grandmother . She had attended three primary schools successively : St Patrick 's in Swansea , Hamilton North Public School , and St Peter 's in Stockton . Leigh spent most of her weekends and school holidays with her grandmother at her house in <unk> Bay . Her cousin and best friend Tracey stated she and Leigh enjoyed going to the cinema together , as well as roller @-@ skating and " just hanging about " . According to her aunt , Leigh had wanted to be a veterinarian . Both Leigh 's mother and her grandmother described her as a " typical teenager " . 
 = = Night of the murder = = 
 Newcastle High School student Jason Robertson 's 16th birthday party was held on 3 November 1989 at the North Stockton Surf Club , a formerly abandoned building which the Stockton Lions Club had taken over four years prior , leasing it for various functions . Police estimated that about 60 people had attended the party , though figures as high as 100 were reported in the media . Most of the attendees were Year Ten students from Newcastle High School , though two 10 @-@ year @-@ olds were seen at the party at one point . Many were drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana , and some were having sex . 
 Fourteen @-@ year @-@ old Leigh had a written invitation to attend the party and permission from her mother to stay there until 11 pm ; Leigh 's mother had been assured that responsible adults would be present at the party . Matthew Webster and Guy Wilson , who acted as bouncers , were the only people aged over 18 at the party . Leigh was said to be very excited , as it was the first teenage party she had attended . According to police witness reports , Leigh was one of several under @-@ age girls who were invited to the party for the purpose of getting them intoxicated and having sex with them . According to a police report , Webster approached another person at the party and said , " Hey dude , we 're going to get Leigh pissed and all go through her . " Leigh was also one of several under @-@ age people for whom an adult purchased alcohol before the party ; she and her friend were given a bottle of Jim Beam whiskey , which they then mixed with Coca @-@ Cola . She was reported to have gotten heavily intoxicated very quickly . A 15 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who for legal reasons could not be named and was referred to in official documentation as ' NC1 ' , is quoted to have said , " I 'm going to go and fuck [ Leigh ] . " Shortly afterwards Leigh went to the beach with NC1 ; witnesses stated Leigh was so intoxicated that he " had to almost carry her . " 
 When Leigh returned from the beach , she was bleeding between her legs , distressed , crying and seeking assistance . Some people at the party reported trying to console Leigh and find out what had happened to her ; Leigh " asserted she had been raped " , replying " [ NC1 ] fucked me " and " I hate him " . After witnessing Leigh 's complaints , Webster is quoted as saying to a group of boys " she 's a bit of a slut and why don 't all of us have a go " . Nineteen @-@ year @-@ old Guy Wilson then approached Leigh , placed his arm around her and asked her for sex . Wilson pushed Leigh to the ground when she refused , and was joined by Webster and around ten other boys who surrounded Leigh . They yelled abuse , kicked her , poured beer on her and spat both beer and saliva on her . Several people witnessed the assault , yet nobody came to help her or attempted to contact the police , her parents or other adults . The assaults continued for approximately five minutes ; Leigh stood up when they stopped and staggered away before picking up an empty beer bottle and throwing it at the group of boys , missing them . Guy Wilson threw a beer bottle back at her as she left , which either hit her in the leg or missed , according to different witness accounts . The group of boys followed her inside the crowded clubhouse where she sought refuge , and similar assaults continued . Leigh was seen leaving the club and walking towards the beach at about 10 : 30 pm . Leigh 's stepfather arrived at the party to pick her up at 10 : 50 pm . He and several of the party @-@ goers searched for Leigh , but she could not be found . After repeated search attempts , Leigh 's mother and stepfather decided to wait for her to return home , assuming she had gone to a friend 's house for the night . Leigh 's stepfather recommenced the search for Leigh the following morning , aided by several youths from the party . Her body was found in the sand dunes about 90 metres ( 300 ft ) north of the surf club . Leigh 's invitation to attend the party was still in her pocket . 
 Leigh was found naked except for her socks and shoes , with her knickers and shorts around her right ankle . She was on her back with her legs apart . Her bra , which had its securing hook bent , was found nearby , as was her shirt and jumper , which were intertwined , inside out and stained with liquor . <unk> nearby had been flattened . According to the police forensics report , a blood @-@ stained rock weighing 5 @.@ 6 kg ( 12 lb ) was found next to her , and blood stains were found up to 2 @.@ 8 metres ( 9 @.@ 2 ft ) from her body . 
 = = = Postmortem = = = 
 The postmortem report stated Leigh 's cause of death to be a fractured skull and injury to the brain . Leigh had been struck with great force several times , including at least three times in the head . The postmortem also found that Leigh had <unk> <unk> , and multiple injuries to the jaw , ribs , liver and right kidney . Leigh had neck fingertip pressure injuries , indicating she had been choked before she died , though this was not the cause of death . Leigh 's blood alcohol reading was 0 @.@ 128 , a level which , according to the University of Notre Dame , would have caused " significant impairment of motor coordination and loss of good judgment . " There was no doubt that Leigh was violently sexually assaulted before she was murdered . Leigh had deep bruising to the left wall of her vagina , extensive bruising to her hymen and two tears , one 20 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) long , to her vulva . An analysis of the postmortem by Johan <unk> stated that an inflexible object , possibly a beer bottle , was likely to have caused most of her genital injuries . No semen was found in her body . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 Twenty detectives , led by Detective Sergeant Lance Chaffey , were assigned to the case though the squad was reduced to fewer than ten members several weeks later . Crime reporter Mark Riley wrote that police were going through the " exhaustive process " of cross @-@ checking the stories of several dozen teenagers ; by 5 November police had interviewed around 40 teenagers , stating they expected to interview around 20 more . The three suspects who emerged early in the investigation were Matthew Webster , Guy Wilson and NC1 . In interviews on 5 November , NC1 admitted to having sex with Leigh , but said it was consensual . Wilson initially denied any wrongdoing , though in a later interview he admitted to pushing Leigh , pouring beer over her , spitting on her and throwing an empty beer bottle at her . Webster admitted to pouring beer on Leigh , but denied sexually assaulting or killing her . He originally told police he went to a pub after the party , but in an interview eight days later changed his story to state that he had gone for a walk . Webster also stated that two 14 @-@ year @-@ old girls had approached him and NC1 at the party , asking for some " hash " , and that the two of them had obtained a small bag of resin and exchanged it with the girls for $ 20 . Blood samples were taken from two suspects ; The Newcastle Herald reported this as probably the first use of DNA tests in a Hunter Valley murder investigation . Clothing samples were also taken from several suspects . 
 In her book Who Killed Leigh Leigh ? , Kerry Carrington , a criminologist and prominent researcher of the murder , described the investigation as being " fuelled by mutual suspicion and by rumour and counter @-@ rumour . " People who attended the party complained of living in fear of being the next rumoured killer ; Matthew Webster , Jason Robertson and two other boys appeared on the front page of The Newcastle Herald on 8 November with such complaints . For a time the most popular rumour was that Leigh had been murdered by her stepfather , and that he had been having sex with her for months . In November 1990 Detective Chaffey told journalist Mark Riley that police had heard this rumour so many times that they considered Shearman to be a suspect . Riley 's article stated that the community of Stockton harboured suspicions about Shearman right until Webster was charged with murder . On 16 November Webster pleaded guilty to assaulting Leigh and to supplying cannabis resin to a minor . He was released on bail , with his sentencing scheduled for 21 February 1990 . On 19 January Wilson pleaded guilty to assaulting Leigh ; he was released on bail pending sentencing . On 28 January , upon being taunted by four boys regarding the murder , Webster assaulted one of them . On 31 January , Brad Shearman approached Guy Wilson in public , and punched him in the head three times after Wilson allegedly told him he would get Leigh 's younger sister next . Shearman was charged and pleaded guilty to assault . 
 While he was still on bail on 16 February 1990 , during his third interview with police , Webster admitted to killing Leigh . In the interview transcript , Webster initially denied killing Leigh , then " without being asked a further question " he stated , " Well , I did it . But I just can 't believe ... it happened . It 's just unbelievable . " Webster went on to state that he saw Leigh while he was looking for his stash of beers . According to Webster , they walked to the <unk> together , where he pulled off her clothes and stuck a finger in her vagina . Webster stated he lost his temper when Leigh rebuffed him , choking her for a while before killing her with a rock , specifically saying he killed Leigh because he " thought she would squeal on [ him ] for trying to rape her . " After spending the weekend in a police cell , Webster appeared in court on 19 February where he was refused bail . On 21 March , while in custody , Webster was convicted and fined $ 250 for offensive behaviour in the 28 January assault . On 17 July Shearman was given a 12 @-@ month good behaviour bond for the 31 January assault ; the judge did not record a conviction , taking into consideration that he had been provoked into attacking Wilson . 
 = = Convictions = = 
 NC1 was the first to be sentenced , on 28 February 1990 , after pleading guilty to having sex with someone under the age of consent . He was given six months ' custody in a detention centre , the maximum possible sentence for a youth charged with that offence . Kerry Carrington and Andrew Johnson , writing in The Australian Feminist Law Journal , said it was likely that prosecutors did not charge NC1 with rape , as a conviction on such a charge would have been unlikely due to a lack of evidence ; Leigh 's complaints about the incident as reported by witnesses were hearsay and therefore inadmissible in court . On 11 May the sentence was reduced on appeal to 100 hours ' community service . In reducing his sentence the judge stated the evidence obliged him to find that the sex was consensual , and that it was better for NC1 to do something positive for the community rather than possibly being led further astray in custody . A number of sources state the judge reached the conclusion that the sex had been consensual because of the inadequate way the evidence was presented to the court . 
 On 19 March 1990 Wilson was sentenced to six months ' imprisonment for assaulting Leigh . 
 Charges were initially laid against Webster for sexual assault , though by the time the case went to trial they had been dropped without public explanation . Hillary Byrne @-@ Armstrong , writing in The Australian Feminist Law Journal , stated it was likely that Webster was offered a plea bargain that would drop the lesser charges in exchange for his guilty plea for murder . Webster pleaded guilty to Leigh 's murder on 24 October 1990 . The guilty plea meant that no witnesses were called for the trial ; Detective Chaffey instead read a list of facts to the court . Justice James Roland Wood sentenced Webster to a minimum of 14 years in prison , with an additional six years during which he would be eligible for parole , saying that a life sentence was inappropriate in view of Webster 's potential to be rehabilitated . Wood found that Webster 's motivation for killing Leigh was his fear she would report his sexual assault . Five Stockton citizens volunteered to give character evidence at his trial , describing the 120 kg ( 265 lb ) teenager as a quiet " gentle giant " from a good family . Others expressed amazement at this description of Webster , who was also known as " fat Matt , the thug of Stockton " . Webster served his sentence at <unk> Correctional Centre . 
 While acknowledging that plea bargains such as the one Webster was probably offered are common and help avoid expensive and time @-@ consuming trials , Byrne @-@ Armstrong stated that accepting Webster 's confession helped create a legal fiction that he unquestionably acted alone in both sexually assaulting and murdering Leigh . The actual level of sexual violence that Leigh sustained was accordingly , she said , " all but erased " from the sentencing , and it appeared Justice Wood had only been given the limited information from the post @-@ mortem report that would have corroborated Webster 's confession . 
 Webster was the first person in New South Wales to be sentenced under the " truth in sentencing " legislation , which meant he could not be released under any circumstances before the end of his 14 @-@ year non @-@ parole period ; under the previous legislation a person of Webster 's age would probably have been released after only nine years . Webster appealed the length of his prison term to the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal , where Justices Gleeson , Lee and Allen dismissed his appeal in July 1992 . In their view the crime was " so gross that nothing less of a very severe sentence would accord with the general moral sense of the community . " 
 Webster 's first application for parole in February 2004 was denied as he had not yet undertaken work release . After completing a few months of this program , Webster was released on parole on 10 June 2004 after serving 14 ½ years . The conditions of his parole specified that he would only be allowed to visit Newcastle or Stockton with permission from his probation and parole officer . Webster 's parole was discussed in the Parliament of New South Wales , with Minister John <unk> responding to queries and concluding that the option to supervise Webster 's re @-@ integration into society was better than the alternative of releasing him without supervision at the end of his sentence . Following his release , Leigh 's family stated they harboured " no ill thoughts " towards Webster and wished him well in the " re @-@ establishment of his life " . Webster 's parole was revoked in November 2004 after he was arrested for assault ; he pleaded not guilty , citing self @-@ defence . He was released from prison in May 2005 after the charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence . 
 = = Media coverage = = 
 Leigh 's death received widespread and ongoing coverage in both the Sydney and Newcastle media , possibly due to a fascination with her reduplicated name . Between 1989 and 1994 , The Newcastle Herald ran at least 39 stories on Leigh , 23 of them featured on the front page . At least ten articles on the case were published in The Sydney Morning Herald during the same period . Both the extended media coverage and the theatrical plays and film the murder inspired have led to it being termed a " celebrity crime " , and to Leigh being referred to as a " celebrity victim " . In 1996 Psychologist Roger Peters attributed the media fascination to the sense of community in Stockton , and due to the crimes being committed by people not considered to be typical criminals , stating " I think one of the main things is that people can identify with people involved . Had it of been a criminal from outside who stalked her and killed I think it would be long forgotten . " 
 Various sources considered the media coverage prior to Webster 's arrest to be focused on finding something to blame other than her murderer . After Webster 's arrest the media continued to search for any outside agency that might have been responsible for the event . From the beginning , media reports highlighted the lack of parental supervision at the party , and in sentencing Webster , Justice Wood made comments criticising the lack of parental supervision . Researchers Jonathan Morrow and <unk> San Roque in the Sydney Law Review wrote that Wood 's comments " might as well have been quoted from the very newspapers that were covering the crime " ; his comments , in turn , were heavily reported in the media . Webster 's sentencing also received considerable media coverage , possibly due to his youth and the length of his sentence , as well as curiosity about the newly established " truth @-@ in @-@ sentencing " principles . His appeal regarding the length of his sentence received similar coverage . 
 According to observations by Kerry Carrington and Andrew Johnson , media references to Leigh being sexually assaulted " almost completely disappeared " in less than a year , as did the references to her being assaulted by the group of boys . They stated that the fact that NC1 was not charged with raping Leigh had created the legal fiction that his sex with her was consensual . The " unsustainable assumption " that Leigh consented to sex was the turning point in her being blamed for her own assault and murder on the grounds that , because she was supposedly sexually promiscuous , Leigh had somehow " asked for [ the attack ] " . In addition to sexual promiscuity and the lack of parental supervision , Carrington states that media attention also shifted to the presence of drugs and alcohol at the party ; Morrow and San Roque credit media attention to these factors as taking attention away from the abuse that Leigh suffered before she died . The epithet slut in a pretrial psychological report also became a topic of focus for the media : 
 Webster attacked Leigh , not so much because she would not let him have sex with her but because she became the living proof that even a slut , a property of the clan , thought he was not good enough to have sex with . 
 Carrington accused the media of completely missing the point that the report was not stating the views of the psychiatrist , rather it was the psychiatrist 's interpretation of Webster 's feelings . She also considered Mark Riley 's extended coverage of the case , which she described at one point as " journalistic voyeurism " , to be the most profound case of shifting the blame from the assailants to Leigh herself . One of Riley 's articles in particular was considered by her to have suggested that Leigh 's discussions with her mother about sex and Leigh 's looks and physical development had contributed to her murder . Morrow and San Roque also criticised Riley 's article , stating it " disturbingly ... married parental blame with the well @-@ documented notion that the rape victim herself is presumably to blame for her attack . " Several writers , including Eva Cox and Adele Horin , rejected the concept that Leigh was in any way responsible for her sexual assault and murder . The media coverage of the murder has been considered by multiple sources to be part of a wider culture of victim blaming . 
 = = Criticism of police = = 
 Police were criticised over their handling of the investigation , including their failure to identify perpetrators in a timely manner . It took police over three months to press charges against Webster even though they had established within ten days that he had lied about his whereabouts , had publicly stated his intention to rape Leigh , and had the opportunity to commit the crime . 
 Criticism was also raised regarding the relatively few convictions . Despite several people 's admissions to police that they physically attacked Leigh at the party , only Wilson was charged with assault , and the adult who admitted to supplying her with alcohol prior to the party was never charged . NC1 admitted to having sex with another under @-@ age girl at the party , though he was not charged with that offence . With the exception of the charges against Webster that were dropped without explanation , nobody was ever charged with raping or sexually assaulting Leigh in spite of the presence of graphic forensic evidence of genital injuries . During a report on Radio National , Leigh 's mother said that when she asked Detective Chaffey why others were not being charged , he asked her if she knew " how much it costs to run an investigation " . 
 = = = Forensic testing = = = 
 Police took blood and clothing samples from suspects , including the shirt Wilson was wearing on the night of the murder , which he admitted had a <unk> on it , but it is not known whether any DNA tests were carried out . Kerry Carrington speculated that the reports of evidence being sent for testing may have been a fabrication to obtain a confession . Leigh 's grandmother told Carrington that she called Scotland Yard to enquire about the results , as a detective on the case had informed Leigh 's family that this was where the suspects ' clothing had been sent . Scotland Yard informed her that they had not received anything from Australia for forensic testing in the relevant timespan . 
 The only record of forensic testing that has been uncovered is an acknowledgement by a forensic biologist of four items being received for testing on 6 November 1989 : three items of Leigh 's clothing , and the blood @-@ stained rock found near her body . The acknowledgement , however , indicates that other items were not sent for testing . Results from the supposed tests were never made available , nor was information on why the other items were not sent . According to Carrington , four years after the investigation a detective involved in the case told her that none of the samples taken from suspects were tested . Samples taken from Webster were not used in his prosecution . Professor Harry Boettcher , a forensic scientist , said that if police did not actually test the samples it would be " professional negligence – indefensible " . In 2009 a solicitor who acted on behalf of Leigh 's family stated that given the advances in DNA testing technology , it was time to re @-@ examine the evidence . 
 = = = Possibility of accomplices = = = 
 Several factors have led to speculation that Webster was not alone when he killed Leigh . According to the transcript of Webster 's confession , he was never asked if he acted alone . Carrington accused police of accepting Webster 's confession at face value , ignoring both forensic and witness evidence . Her investigations highlighted several discrepancies in Webster 's confession , and in the forensic evidence . For example , Webster stated in his confession that he had choked Leigh with his left hand as he knelt beside her although , according to the autopsy report , the bruises on Leigh 's neck were consistent with being choked with a right hand . Carrington also questioned Webster 's statement that he walked along lit streets to the other side of the Stockton peninsula to wash his bloodstained hands , when he could have washed his hands in total darkness at the beach less than 100 metres ( 330 ft ) away . She also queried his claim that he had blood on his hands but none on his clothes , despite Leigh having been struck so hard blood was splattered 2 @.@ 8 metres one way from her body and 1 @.@ 3 metres the other way . Webster stated that he walked to the beach with Leigh , though according to police reports four witnesses said she walked to the beach alone ; two witnesses stated they saw Webster and Wilson leave the surf club together . Neither NC1 nor Wilson had a reliable alibi for their whereabouts at the time of the murder ; Wilson told police he was alone on the beach when Leigh walked past him as she left the club , minutes before she was murdered . Webster 's statement that he only penetrated Leigh with his finger has been considered by various sources to be inconsistent with the autopsy findings of genital trauma , and the trauma is also inconsistent with NC1 's account that his sex with her was consensual . In reviewing the autopsy , Boettcher said that the numerous blows which killed Leigh came from multiple directions , and were probably inflicted with different items , indicating the possibility of more than one perpetrator . 
 Carrington and Johnson speculated that Leigh was assaulted by the group of boys after returning from the beach , as punishment for complaining about being raped , and was murdered by Webster and two others because they were afraid she would tell other people . They refused to specifically name the two other suspects for fear of legal repercussions , though clarified that one had sexually assaulted Leigh earlier in the night , and the other likely sexually assaulted her with a beer bottle before she died , as punishment for publicly refusing to have sex with him . Webster talked to the media about the murder for the first time in 1997 , and insisted that he acted alone in killing Leigh . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After being told that nobody was going to be charged with Leigh 's sexual assault , in 1990 Leigh 's mother began a campaign for the case to be officially re @-@ investigated . In August 1994 , Kerry Carrington sent a 17 @,@ 000 @-@ word document and 300 pages of evidence to the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service , asking for the case to be investigated . The commission was headed by Judge James Roland Wood , though a representative for the commission stated that Wood 's involvement in Webster 's trial would not affect the outcome of any investigation . In December 1994 , a representative for the commission said that after thorough consideration , they would not be investigating the matter . 
 In May 1993 a victim 's compensation case had awarded Leigh 's mother and sister a combined total of $ 29 @,@ 214 . An appeal , aided by Carrington 's research , was lodged against the original victim 's compensation payout . In May 1995 , in a landmark legal decision , Judge Joseph Moore approved the appeal , awarding Leigh 's mother and sister an additional $ 134 @,@ 048 . Moore said the evidence indicated that Leigh rejected NC1 's sexual advances , and that " his intercourse with her was without her consent . " He also acknowledged that whoever sexually assaulted Leigh had never been brought to justice , and the lack of convictions for assault , specifically naming Jason Robertson and three other boys as those who assaulted her in addition to Webster and Wilson . Leigh 's mother abandoned her efforts to have the case re @-@ opened in 1997 , citing " exhaustion and survival " . 
 = = = NSW Crime Commission = = = 
 In October 1996 , Police Minister Paul Whelan made an announcement in the Parliament of New South Wales , stating that the murder would be reviewed by the New South Wales Crime Commission . Acknowledging that nobody had ever been charged with Leigh 's sexual assault , Whelan stated the upcoming review was " our one opportunity to right the terrible wrongs that occurred on the night that Leigh died . " 
 In March 1998 the Crime Commission released its findings , stating that the crimes that resulted in convictions occurred substantially in the way described to the courts , that no further charges would be laid as Webster had acted alone in both the murder and the assault that immediately preceded it , and that police had not acted inappropriately in their decision not to charge other persons . It did , however , criticise some police procedures and practices . The review did not comment on the discrepancies between Webster 's confession and the forensic evidence , and it did not clarify whether forensic evidence was ever sent for testing . A representative for the Commission refused to comment on whether Wilson 's blood @-@ stained shirt was ever tested . One expert opinion obtained by the Commission wrote that it was " likely [ Webster ] engaged in sexual behaviour which demeaned Leigh and to which he will never admit because he is ashamed and embarrassed " , and another said that a finger or penis was unlikely to have caused Leigh 's severe genital damage . Hillary Byrne @-@ Armstrong stated that these expert opinions , which contradict Webster 's confession , raised questions on how the Commission concluded that Leigh 's sexual assault occurred in the manner to which he had confessed , also raising doubts about several of the Commission 's other findings . The Crime Commission released one of their two reports on the matter ; their second unpublished report was handed over to the Police Integrity Commission ( PIC ) for investigation . 
 = = = Police Integrity Commission = = = 
 Twenty @-@ six people , mainly police officers , were interviewed in 1998 as part of the subsequent PIC inquiry . Several witnesses from the party , as well as Webster , Wilson and NC1 were also questioned . The inquiry heard allegations that police assaulted four people during interviews : Webster , Wilson , NC1 and another unnamed suspect referred to as <unk> , a relative of Webster who was 17 at the time of the murder . Admitting to the inquiry that he killed Leigh and insisting that he was alone in doing so , Webster stated that police repeatedly punched and kicked him when he refused to confess to her murder . According to Scott Tucker writing in The Newcastle Herald , police were also accused of threatening violence , falsifying reports and withholding evidence ; one of the officers being investigated had his police locker raided by internal affairs , who discovered several records on the murder that had previously been listed as missing . Carrington was also summoned to give evidence , though she was not informed why ; her book , Who Killed Leigh Leigh , which criticised police over their handling of the investigation , had been released earlier that year . Carrington was cross @-@ examined for three days , longer than any of the police officers who were questioned , in what was described by Hillary Byrne @-@ Armstrong as " an inquisition on just about every word she had spoken [ or ] written " in relation to Leigh 's murder . " Byrne @-@ Armstrong accused the PIC of summoning Carrington for the sole purpose of attacking her credibility on issues they had no intention of investigating , and to discredit someone who had attracted considerable media attention for criticising police . 
 The PIC released their review in October 2000 . The review recommended the dismissal of Detective Sergeant Chaffey for " gross dereliction " of duty , also recommending criminal charges against five other investigative officers . The review stated that Webster was falsely arrested , as police arrested him for the purpose of questioning , something for which they did not have the power , and that he was probably assaulted by police while he was in custody . Police received further criticism after it was uncovered that they had interviewed NC1 without contacting his parents , and did not question him about Leigh 's murder , only about his intercourse with her . Following the review , Chaffey retired " a little earlier than [ he ] intended " , but dismissed the review 's findings , stating he was proud of his team 's performance . In October 2001 , the Director of Public Prosecutions declined to press criminal charges against any of the officers , on the grounds they had suffered emotional hardship and their careers had already been destroyed . The case , which was described on PM as " one of the longest ever investigations into police conduct in New South Wales " , prompted changes in the New South Wales Police Force , including the reform of record @-@ keeping procedures . 
 = = Theatrical and film adaptations = = 
 Newcastle 's Freewheels Theatre commissioned Nick Enright to produce a play that explored themes around the rape and murder . Titled A Property of the Clan , it premiered at the Freewheels Theatre in Newcastle in 1992 , and was performed at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1993 . The title was taken from the controversial quote in the psychological report on Webster made in preparation for his trial . Enright omitted the criminal acts and the murder from the play , instead focusing on the drama , its participants and the aftermath of the murder . The play was shown at various high schools in the Newcastle area , and following its positive reception was shown at high schools nationally , winning several awards . However , Newcastle High School , where both Leigh and Webster had been students , declined to show it . The play is set in the fictional town of Blackrock , and the rape and murder victim is named Tracy . Leigh 's family requested that the name be changed , as ' Tracey ' was the name of Leigh 's cousin and best friend . The name remained , despite other revisions to the script ; the play was retitled Blackrock . It was performed by the Sydney Theatre Company in 1995 and 1996 . 
 Blackrock was developed into a film of the same name , which was partially filmed in Stockton and released in 1997 . The community of Stockton opposed filming in the area , stating the memories of the events were still fresh and the details of the script were " too close for comfort " . When filmmakers arrived in Stockton the local media treated them with hostility , and locations that had previously been reserved were no longer available . The situation was exacerbated by the filmmakers ' denial that the film was specifically about Leigh , despite the choice of Stockton for filming . Leigh 's family were opposed to the film , saying the filmmakers were " feasting on an unfortunate situation " and portraying Leigh negatively . Associate professor Donna Lee Brien of Central Queensland University stated that some fictional aspects in the film portrayed Leigh in a negative manner , though the book Reel Tracks by Rebecca Doyle credited the film with correcting misinformation reported in the media regarding the murder , as well as with providing a forum for reflection on the events . The film received a mixed @-@ to @-@ positive reception in Australia , but performed poorly when shown elsewhere ; Brien stated that because the film lacked the " poignant and powerful narrative support of Leigh 's tragedy " , it was deemed by critics to be " shallow and clichéd " . 
 = Lockheed YF @-@ 22 = 
 The Lockheed / Boeing / General Dynamics YF @-@ 22 was an American single @-@ seat , twin @-@ engine fighter aircraft technology demonstrator designed for the United States Air Force ( USAF ) . The design was a finalist in the USAF 's Advanced Tactical Fighter competition , and two prototypes were built for the demonstration / validation phase of the competition . The YF @-@ 22 won the contest against the Northrop YF @-@ 23 , and entered production as the Lockheed Martin F @-@ 22 Raptor . The YF @-@ 22 has similar aerodynamic layout and configuration as the F @-@ 22 , but with differences in the position and design of the cockpit , tail fins and wings , and in internal structural layout . 
 In the 1980s , the USAF began looking for a replacement for its fighter aircraft , especially to counter the advanced Su @-@ 27 and MiG @-@ 29 . A number of companies , divided into two teams , submitted their proposals . Northrop and McDonnell Douglas submitted the YF @-@ 23 . Lockheed , Boeing and General Dynamics proposed and built the YF @-@ 22 , which , although marginally slower and having a larger radar cross @-@ section , was more agile than the YF @-@ 23 . Primarily for this reason , it was picked by the Air Force as the winner of the ATF in April 1991 . Following the selection , the first YF @-@ 22 was retired to a museum , while the second prototype continued flying until an accident relegated it to the role of an antenna test vehicle .

 In 1981 , the U.S. Air Force developed a requirement for an Advanced Tactical Fighter ( ATF ) as a new air superiority fighter to replace the F @-@ 15 Eagle and F @-@ 16 Fighting Falcon . This was made more crucial by the emerging worldwide threats , including development and proliferation of Soviet MiG @-@ 29 and Su @-@ 27 " Flanker " -class fighter aircraft . It would take advantage of the new technologies in fighter design on the horizon including composite materials , lightweight alloys , advanced flight @-@ control systems , more powerful propulsion systems and stealth technology . In 1985 the Air Force sent out technical requests for proposals to a number of aircraft manufacturing teams . The formal request for proposal ( RFP ) was issued in July 1986 , and two contractor teams , Lockheed , Boeing and General Dynamics , along with Northrop and McDonnell Douglas , were selected on 31 October 1986 to undertake a 50 @-@ month demonstration phase , culminating in the flight test of the two teams ' prototypes , the YF @-@ 22 and the YF @-@ 23 . 
 The YF @-@ 22 was designed to meet USAF requirements for survivability , supercruise , stealth , and ease of maintenance . Because Lockheed 's submission was selected as one of the winners , the company , through its Skunk Works division , assumed leadership of the program partners . It would be responsible for the forward cockpit and fuselage , as well as final assembly at Palmdale , California . Meanwhile , the wings and aft fuselage would be built by Boeing , with the center fuselage , weapons bays , tail and landing gears built by General Dynamics . Compared with its Northrop / McDonnell Douglas counterpart , the YF @-@ 22 has a more conventional design – its wings have larger control surfaces , such as full @-@ span trailing edge , and , whereas the YF @-@ 23 had two tail surfaces , the YF @-@ 22 had four , which made it more maneuverable than its counterpart . Two examples of each prototype air vehicle ( PAV ) were built for the Demonstration @-@ Validation phase : one with General Electric YF120 engines , the other with Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines . 
 The YF @-@ 22 was given the unofficial name " Lightning II " after Lockheed 's World War II @-@ era fighter , the P @-@ 38 Lightning , which persisted until the mid @-@ 1990s when the USAF officially named the aircraft " Raptor " . The F @-@ 35 later received the Lightning II name in 2006 . 
 The first YF @-@ 22 ( PAV @-@ 1 , serial number 87 @-@ 0700 , <unk> ) , with the GE YF120 , was rolled out on 29 August 1990 and first flew on 29 September 1990 , taking off from Palmdale piloted by David L. Ferguson . During the 18 @-@ minute flight , PAV @-@ 1 reached a maximum speed of 250 knots ( 460 km / h ; 290 mph ) and a height of 12 @,@ 500 feet ( 3 @,@ 800 m ) , before landing at Edwards AFB . Following the flight , Ferguson said that the remainder of the YF @-@ 22 test program would be concentrated on " ... the manoeuvrability of the aeroplane , both supersonic and subsonic " . The second YF @-@ 22 ( PAV @-@ 2 , s / n 87 @-@ <unk> , <unk> ) with the P & W YF119 made its maiden flight on 30 October at the hands of Tom <unk> .

 During the flight test program , unlike the YF @-@ 23 , weapon firings and high ( 60 ° ) angle of attack ( AoA , or high @-@ Alpha ) flights were carried out on the YF @-@ 22 . Though not a requirement , the aircraft fired AIM @-@ 9 Sidewinder and AIM @-@ 120 AMRAAM missiles from internal weapon bays . Flight testing also demonstrated that the YF @-@ 22 with its thrust vectoring nozzles achieved pitch rates more than double that of the F @-@ 16 at low @-@ speed maneuvering . The first prototype , PAV @-@ 1 , achieved Mach 1 @.@ 58 in supercruise , while PAV @-@ 2 reached a maximum supercruise speed of Mach 1 @.@ 43 ; maximum speed was in excess of Mach 2 @.@ 0 . Flight testing continued until 28 December 1990 , by which time 74 flights were completed and 91 @.@ 6 airborne hours were accumulated . Following flight testing , the contractor teams submitted proposals for ATF production . 
 On 23 April 1991 , the YF @-@ 22 was announced by Secretary of the Air Force Donald Rice as the winner of the ATF competition . The YF @-@ 23 design was stealthier and faster , but the YF @-@ 22 was more agile . It was speculated in the aviation press that the YF @-@ 22 was also seen as more adaptable to the Navy 's Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter ( NATF ) , but the US Navy abandoned NATF by 1992 . Instead of being retired , as with the case of PAV @-@ 1 , PAV @-@ 2 subsequently flew sorties following the competition – it amassed another 61 @.@ 6 flying hours during 39 flights . On 25 April 1992 , the aircraft sustained serious damage during a landing attempt as a result of pilot @-@ induced oscillations . It was repaired but never flew again , and instead served as a static test vehicle thereafter . In 1991 , it was anticipated that 650 production F @-@ 22s would be procured . 
 = = = F @-@ 22 production = = = 
 As the Lockheed team won the ATF competition , it was awarded the engineering , manufacturing and development ( EMD ) contract , which would ultimately allow it to proceed with production of operational aircraft . The EMD called for seven single @-@ seat F @-@ 22A and two twin @-@ seat F @-@ 22Bs . On 9 April 1997 , the first of these , Spirit of America , was rolled out . During the ceremony , the F @-@ 22 was officially named " Raptor " . Due to limited funding , the first flight , which had previously been scheduled for mid @-@ 1996 , occurred on 7 September 1997 . Flight testing for the F @-@ 22 continued until 2005 , and on 15 December 2005 the USAF announced that the Raptor had reached its initial operational capability ( IOC ) . 
 In many respects , the YF @-@ 22s were different from production F @-@ 22s . Contrary to the F @-@ 117 Nighthawk , which was initially difficult to control because of small vertical stabilizers , Lockheed over @-@ specified the fin area on its YF @-@ 22 . Therefore , the company reduced the size of those on F @-@ 22s by 20 – 30 percent . Lockheed recontoured the shape of the wing and stabilator trailing edges to improve aerodynamics , strength , and stealth characteristics ; the wing and <unk> sweep was reduced by 6 ° from 48 ° . Finally , to improve pilot visibility , the canopy was moved forward 7 inches ( 178 mm ) , and the engine intakes were moved rearward 14 inches ( 356 mm ) .

 = Gallipoli Campaign = 
 The Gallipoli Campaign , also known as the Dardanelles Campaign , the Battle of Gallipoli or the Battle of Çanakkale ( Turkish : Çanakkale <unk> ) , was a campaign of World War I that took place on the Gallipoli peninsula ( <unk> in modern Turkey ) in the Ottoman Empire between 25 April 1915 and 9 January 1916 . The peninsula forms the northern bank of the Dardanelles , a strait that provided a sea route to the Russian Empire , one of the Allied powers during the war . Intending to secure it , Russia 's allies Britain and France launched a naval attack followed by an amphibious landing on the peninsula , with the aim of capturing the Ottoman capital of Constantinople ( modern Istanbul ) . The naval attack was repelled and after eight months ' fighting , with many casualties on both sides , the land campaign was abandoned and the invasion force was withdrawn to Egypt . 
 The campaign was one of the greatest Ottoman victories during the war . In Turkey , it is regarded as a defining moment in the nation 's history : a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire crumbled . The struggle formed the basis for the Turkish War of Independence and the declaration of the Republic of Turkey eight years later under Mustafa Kemal ( Kemal Atatürk ) who first rose to prominence as a commander at Gallipoli . The campaign is often considered as marking the birth of national consciousness in Australia and New Zealand and the date of the landing , 25 April , is known as " Anzac Day " which is the most significant commemoration of military casualties and veterans in those two countries , surpassing Remembrance Day ( Armistice Day ) .

 = = = Ottoman entry into the war = = = 
 At the beginning of the 20th century , the Ottoman Empire had the reputation of being the " sick man of Europe " , weakened by political instability , military defeat and civil strife following a century of decline . In 1908 , a group of young officers , known as the Young Turks , seized power in Constantinople , while Mehmed V was later installed as a figurehead Sultan in 1909 . The new régime implemented a program of reform to modernise the outdated political and economic system and to redefine the racial make @-@ up of the empire . An enthusiastic supporter , Germany provided significant investment . German diplomats subsequently found increasing influence , despite Britain previously being the predominant power in the region , while German officers assisted in training and re @-@ equipping the army . 
 Despite this support , the economic resources of the Ottoman Empire were depleted by the cost of the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 and the French , British and Germans had offered financial aid . A pro @-@ German faction influenced by Enver Pasha , the former Ottoman military attaché in Berlin , opposed the pro @-@ British majority in the Ottoman cabinet and tried to secure closer relations with Germany . In December 1913 , the Germans sent a military mission to Constantinople , headed by General Otto Liman von Sanders . The geographical position of the Ottoman Empire meant that Russia and her allies France and Britain had a significant interest in Turkish neutrality in the event of war in Europe . 
 During the Sarajevo Crisis in 1914 , German diplomats offered Turkey an anti @-@ Russian alliance and territorial gains in Caucasia , north @-@ west Iran and Trans @-@ <unk> . The pro @-@ British faction in the Cabinet was isolated due to the British ambassador taking leave until 18 August . As the crisis deepened in Europe , Ottoman policy was to obtain a guarantee of territorial integrity and potential advantages , unaware that the British might enter a European war . On 30 July 1914 , two days after the outbreak of the war in Europe , the Ottoman leaders agreed to form a secret Ottoman @-@ German Alliance against Russia , although it did not require them to undertake military action . 
 On 2 August , the British requisitioned two modern battleships — Sultân Osmân @-@ ı Evvel and Reşadiye which British shipyards had started building for the Ottoman Navy — for their own use , alienating pro @-@ British elements in Constantinople , despite the offer of compensation if they remained neutral . This action strained diplomatic relations between the two empires and the German government offered SMS Goeben and SMS Breslau to the Ottoman navy as replacements , in an attempt to gain influence . The Allies tried to intercept the ships , which escaped when the Ottoman government opened the Dardanelles to allow them passage to Constantinople , despite being required under international law , as a neutral party , to block military shipping . By allowing the German ships to enter the Dardanelles , the Ottomans confirmed their links to Germany . 
 In September , the British naval mission to the Ottomans , which had been established in 1912 under Admiral Arthur <unk> , was recalled due to increasing concern that Turkey would soon enter the war . Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon of the Imperial German Navy took over command of the Ottoman navy . Acting without orders from the Ottoman government , on 27 September the German commander of the Dardanelles fortifications ordered the passage closed , adding to the impression that the Ottomans were " in the German camp " . The German naval presence and the success of German armies on all fronts , gave the pro @-@ German faction in the Ottoman government enough influence to declare war on Russia . 
 On 27 October , Goeben and Breslau , having been renamed Yavûz Sultân Selîm and Midilli , sortied into the Black Sea , bombarded the Russian port of Odessa and sank several Russian ships . The Ottomans refused an Allied demand that they expel the German missions and on 31 October 1914 , officially entered the war on the side of the Central Powers . Russia declared war on Turkey on 2 November . The next day , the British ambassador left Constantinople and a British naval squadron off the Dardanelles bombarded the outer defensive forts at Kum Kale and <unk> . A shell hit a magazine , knocked the guns off their mounts and killed 86 soldiers . 
 Britain and France declared war on Turkey on 5 November and the Ottomans declared a jihad ( holy war ) later that month , launching an offensive in the Caucasus against the Russians to regain former Turkish provinces there . Fighting also began in Mesopotamia , following a British landing to occupy the oil facilities in the Persian Gulf . The Ottomans prepared to attack Egypt in early 1915 , aiming to occupy the Suez Canal and cut the Mediterranean route to India and the Far East . Strachan wrote that in hindsight Ottoman belligerence was inevitable , once Goeben and Breslau were allowed into the Dardanelles and that delays after that were caused by Ottoman <unk> for war and Bulgarian neutrality , rather than uncertainty about policy . 
 = = = Allied strategy and the Dardanelles = = = 
 The British had planned to invade <unk> near Alexandretta before the Dardanelles operation with the idea originally presented by <unk> Nubar in 1914 . It was planned by Field Marshal Lord Horatio Kitchener to sever the capital from Syria , Palestine , and Egypt . Alexandretta was an area with a Christian population and was the strategic center of the Empire 's railway network – its capture would have cut the empire in two . Vice Admiral Sir Richard Peirse , East Indies Station , ordered Captain Frank Larkin of HMS Doris to Alexandretta on 13 December 1914 . At the same time , in the same area , the Russian cruiser Askold and the French cruiser Requin were performing similar operations . Kitchener was working on the plan as late as March 1915 . This plan was also the beginning of Britain 's successful effort to start an Arab Revolt . The Alexandretta landing was abandoned because militarily it would have required more resources than France could allocate , and politically France did not want the British operating in their sphere of influence , a position to which Britain had agreed in 1912 . 
 However , by late 1914 the war on the Western Front had become a stalemate ; the Franco @-@ British counter @-@ offensive of the First Battle of the Marne had ended and the British had suffered many casualties in the First Battle of Ypres in Flanders . Lines of trenches had been dug by both sides , running from the Swiss border to the English Channel as the war of manoeuvre ended and trench warfare began . The German Empire and Austria @-@ Hungary closed the overland trade routes between Britain and France in the west and Russia in the east . The White Sea in the arctic north and the Sea of Okhotsk in the Far East were icebound in winter and distant from the Eastern Front , the Baltic Sea was blockaded by the Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial German Navy ) and the entrance to the Black Sea through the Dardanelles was controlled by the Ottoman Empire . While the empire remained neutral supplies could still be sent to Russia through the Dardanelles , but prior to the Ottoman entry into the war the straits had been closed and in November they began to mine the waterway . 
 French Minister of Justice Aristide Briand 's proposal in November to attack the Ottoman Empire was rejected and an attempt by the British to pay the Ottomans to join the Allied side also failed . Later that month , Winston Churchill , First Lord of the Admiralty , proposed a naval attack on the Dardanelles , based in part on erroneous reports of Ottoman troop strength . Churchill wanted to use a large number of obsolete battleships , which could not operate against the German High Seas Fleet , in a Dardanelles operation , with a small occupation force provided by the army . It was hoped that an attack on the Ottomans would also draw Bulgaria and Greece ( both formerly ruled by the Ottomans ) into the war on the Allied side . On 2 January 1915 , Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia appealed to Britain for assistance against the Ottomans , who were conducting an offensive in the Caucasus . Planning began for a naval demonstration in the Dardanelles to divert troops from the Caucasian theatre of operations .

 = = = Attempt to force the Straits = = = 
 On 17 February 1915 , a British seaplane from HMS Ark Royal flew a reconnaissance sortie over the Straits . Two days later , the first attack on the Dardanelles began when a strong Anglo @-@ French task force , including the British battleship HMS Queen Elizabeth , began a long @-@ range bombardment of Ottoman artillery along the coast . The British had intended to utilise Ark Royal 's eight aircraft to spot for the bombardment , but harsh conditions rendered all but one of these , a Short Type 136 , unserviceable . A period of bad weather slowed the initial phase but by 25 February the outer forts had been reduced and the entrance cleared of mines . After this , Royal Marines were landed to destroy guns at Kum Kale on the northern Asian coast and at Sedd el Bahr on the southern tip of the Gallipoli Peninsula , while the naval bombardment shifted to batteries between Kum Kale and <unk> . 
 Frustrated by the mobility of the Ottoman batteries , which evaded the Allied bombardments and threatened the minesweepers sent to clear the Straits , Churchill began pressuring the naval commander , Admiral Sackville Carden , to increase the fleet 's efforts . Carden drew up fresh plans and on 4 March sent a cable to Churchill , stating that the fleet could expect to arrive in Istanbul within 14 days . A sense of impending victory was heightened by the interception of a German wireless message that revealed the Ottoman Dardanelles forts were running out of ammunition . When the message was relayed to Carden , it was agreed a main attack would be launched on or around 17 March . It transpired that Carden , suffering from stress , was placed on the sick list by the medical officer and the fleet was placed under the command of Admiral John de Robeck . 
 On 18 March 1915 , the main attack was launched . The fleet , comprising 18 battleships with a supporting array of cruisers and destroyers , sought to target the narrowest point of the Dardanelles , where the straits are 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) wide . Despite some damage sustained by ships engaging the Ottoman forts , minesweepers were ordered to proceed along the straits . According to an account by the Ottoman General Staff , by 2 : 00 p.m. " all telephone wires were cut , all communications with the forts were interrupted , some of the guns had been knocked out ... in consequence the artillery fire of the defence had slackened considerably " . The French battleship Bouvet was sunk by a mine , causing it to capsize with her crew of over 600 still aboard . Minesweepers manned by civilians , under the constant fire of Ottoman shells , retreated , leaving the minefields largely intact . HMS Irresistible and HMS Inflexible were critically damaged by mines , although there was confusion during the battle about the cause of the damage — some blamed torpedoes . HMS Ocean , sent to rescue the Irresistible , was also damaged by an explosion , and both ships eventually sank . The French battleships Suffren and Gaulois were also damaged ; the ships had sailed through a new line of mines placed secretly by the Ottoman minelayer <unk> ten days before . 
 The losses forced de Robeck to sound the " general recall " to save what remained of his force . During the planning of the campaign , naval losses had been anticipated and so it was mainly obsolete battleships , which were unfit to face the German fleet , that had been sent . Some of the senior naval officers , such as the commander of Queen Elizabeth , Commodore Roger Keyes , felt that they had come close to victory , believing that the Ottoman guns had almost run out of ammunition , but de Robeck , Jackie Fisher and others prevailed and ended Allied attempts to force the straits by naval power , citing unacceptable losses and bad weather . The defeat of the British fleet had given the Ottomans a morale boost ; the day would later come to be celebrated in Turkey as a great victory . Planning to capture the Turkish defences by land began . Two Allied submarines tried to traverse the Dardanelles but were lost to mines and strong currents .

 After the failure of the naval attacks , ground forces were assembled , tasked with eliminating the Ottoman mobile artillery so that minesweepers could clear the way for the larger vessels . The British Secretary of State for War , Lord Kitchener , appointed General Sir Ian Hamilton to command the 78 @,@ 000 @-@ strong Mediterranean Expeditionary Force ( MEF ) that was to carry out the mission . At this time , soldiers from the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) and New Zealand Expeditionary Force ( NZEF ) were encamped in Egypt , undergoing training prior to being sent to France . These troops were formed into the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC ) , which comprised the all @-@ volunteer Australian 1st Division and the New Zealand and Australian Division under the command of Lieutenant General William Birdwood . The ANZAC troops , along with the regular British 29th Division , the Royal Naval Division and the French Oriental Expeditionary Corps , consisting of " metropolitan " and colonial troops , were subsequently placed under Hamilton 's command . With only five divisions the operation would be complicated by the limited forces available , the rugged terrain of the peninsula and the small number of suitable landing beaches , as well as severe logistical difficulties . As the campaign progressed , the troops of the MEF would eventually be supported by about 2 @,@ 000 civilian labourers from the Egyptian and Maltese Labour Corps . 
 As a landing under fire had not been foreseen , the force was not prepared for such an undertaking . The British and French divisions subsequently joined the Australians in Egypt , while over the following month Hamilton prepared his plan , choosing to concentrate his force on the southern part of the Gallipoli peninsula at Cape Helles and Sedd el Bahr . The Allies initially discounted the fighting ability of the Ottoman soldiers , but came to respect them during the campaign . The early apathy was illustrated by a leaflet that was issued to the British and Australians while they were still in Egypt : " Turkish soldiers as a rule manifest their desire to surrender by holding their rifle butt upward and by waving clothes or rags of any colour . An actual white flag should be regarded with the utmost suspicion as a Turkish soldier is unlikely to possess anything of that colour . " Erickson has argued that this apathy stemmed from a " sense of superiority " amongst the Allies , which had resulted from the decline of the Ottoman Empire , and perceptions of its performance in earlier conflicts including the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 . As a result , Allied intelligence failed to adequately prepare for the campaign , in some cases relying on information gained from Egyptian travel guides . 
 The troops earmarked for the assault were required to be loaded on the transports in the order they were to disembark and as a result the landings could not be undertaken until the end of April . Whilst the five @-@ week delay offered the Ottomans the opportunity to strengthen their position on the peninsula , unfavourable weather during March and April might have delayed the landings at any rate and would have prevented any troops ashore from being supplied and reinforced . Australian and New Zealand forces departed Egypt in early April , assembling on the island of Lemnos in Greece , where a small garrison had been established in early March . After arriving on 12 April a number of basic practice landings were undertaken . Meanwhile , on 17 April 1915 , the British submarine HMS E15 under the command of Captain T.S. Brodie had also tried to run the straits , but hit a submarine net and ran aground . The submarine was subsequently shelled by a Turkish fort , killing Brodie and six of the crew and forcing the survivors to surrender .
