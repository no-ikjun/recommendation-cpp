 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Batman Returns has received very positive critical reception . Based on 70 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes , 80 % of critics enjoyed the film , with an average rating of 6 @.@ 7 / 10 . Much of the critics gave praise toward Tim Burton 's visual style , Danny Elfman 's musical score , accompanied by production designer Bo Welch , as well as the casting of Michelle Pfeiffer , Danny DeVito and Christopher Walken in supporting roles to complement Keaton 's portrayal of Batman , though the consistently dark and violent tone received mixed reviews . 
 Janet Maslin in The New York Times thought that " Mr. Burton creates a wicked world of misfits , all of them rendered with the mixture of horror , sympathy and playfulness that has become this director 's hallmark . " She described Michael Keaton as showing " appropriate earnestness " , Danny DeVito as " conveying verve " , Christopher Walken as " wonderfully debonair " , Michelle Pfeiffer as " captivating ... fierce , seductive " , Bo Welch 's production design as " dazzling " , Stefan Czapsky 's cinematography as " crisp " , and Daniel Waters 's screenplay as " sharp . " 
 Peter Travers in Rolling Stone wrote : " Burton uses the summer 's most explosively entertaining movie to lead us back into the liberating darkness of dreams . " He praised the performances : " Pfeiffer gives this feminist avenger a tough core of intelligence and wit ; she 's a classic dazzler ... Michael Keaton 's manic @-@ depressive hero remains a remarkably rich creation . And Danny DeVito 's mutant Penguin — a balloon @-@ bellied Richard III with a kingdom of sewer freaks — is as hilariously warped as Jack Nicholson 's Joker and even quicker with the quips . " 
 Desson Howe in The Washington Post wrote : " Director Burton not only re @-@ creates his one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind atmosphere , he one @-@ ups it , even two @-@ ups it . He 's best at evoking the psycho @-@ murky worlds in which his characters reside . The Penguin holds court in a penguin @-@ crowded , Phantom of the Opera @-@ like sewer home . Keaton hides in a <unk> mansion , which perfectly mirrors its owner 's inner remoteness . Comic strip purists will probably never be happy with a Batman movie . But Returns comes closer than ever to Bob Kane 's dark , original strip , which began in 1939 . " He described Walken as " engaging " , DeVito as " exquisite " and Pfeiffer as " deliciously <unk> . " 
 Todd McCarthy in Variety wrote that " the real accomplishment of the film lies in the amazing physical realization of an imaginative universe . Where Burton 's ideas end and those of his collaborators begin is impossible to know , but the result is a seamless , utterly consistent universe full of nasty notions about societal deterioration , greed and other base impulses . " He praised the contributions of Stan Winston , Danny Elfman , Bo Welch and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky , and in terms of performances , opined that " the deck is stacked entirely in favor of the villains " , calling DeVito " fascinating " and Pfeiffer " very tasty . " 
 Conversely , Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times gave the film two stars out of four , writing : " I give the movie a negative review , and yet I don 't think it 's a bad movie ; it 's more misguided , made with great creativity , but denying us what we more or less deserve from a Batman story . No matter how hard you try , superheroes and film noir don 't go together ; the very essence of noir is that there are no more heroes . " He compared the Penguin negatively with the Joker of the first film , writing that " the Penguin is a curiously meager and depressing creature ; I pitied him , but did not fear him or find him funny . The genius of Danny DeVito is all but swallowed up in the paraphernalia of the role . " Jonathan Rosenbaum called DeVito " a pale substitute for Jack Nicholson from the first film " and felt that " there 's no suspense in Batman Returns whatsoever " . Batman comic book writer / artist Matt Wagner was quoted as saying : " I hated how Batman Returns made Batman little more than just another costumed creep , little better than the villains he 's pursuing . Additionally , Burton is so blatantly not an action director . That aspect of both his films just sucked . " Ty Burr in Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B- ; he wrote that " Burton still hasn 't figured out how to tell a coherent story : He 's more interested in fashioning pretty beads than in putting them on a string .... Yet for all the wintry weirdness , there 's more going on under the surface of this movie than in the original . No wonder some people felt burned by Batman Returns : Tim Burton just may have created the first blockbuster art film . " 
 A " parental backlash " criticized Batman Returns with violence and sexual references that were unsuitable for children . McDonald 's shut down their Happy Meal promotion for the film . Burton responded , " I like Batman Returns better than the first one . There was this big backlash that it was too dark , but I found this movie much less dark . " 
 In 2016 , James Charisma of Playboy ranked the film number fourteen on a list of 15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals .

 Batman Returns would be the last film in the Warner Bros. Batman film series that featured Burton and Michael Keaton as director and leading actor . With Batman Forever , Warner Bros. decided to go in a " lighter " direction to be more mainstream in the process of a family film . Burton had no interest in returning to direct a sequel , but was credited as producer . With Warner Bros. moving on development for Batman Forever in June 1993 , a Catwoman spin @-@ off was announced . Michelle Pfeiffer was to reprise her role , with the character not to appear in Forever because of her own spin @-@ off . 
 Burton became attached as director , while producer Denise Di Novi and writer Daniel Waters also returned . In January 1994 , Burton was unsure of his plans to direct Catwoman or an adaptation of " The Fall of the House of Usher " . On June 6 , 1995 , Waters turned in his Catwoman script to Warner Bros. , the same day Batman Forever was released . Burton was still being courted to direct . Waters joked , " Turning it in the day Batman Forever opened may not have been my best logistical move , in that it 's the celebration of the fun @-@ for @-@ the @-@ whole @-@ family Batman . Catwoman is definitely not a fun @-@ for @-@ the @-@ whole @-@ family script . " In an August 1995 interview , Pfeiffer re @-@ iterated her interest in the spin @-@ off , but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects . The film labored in development hell for years , with Pfeiffer replaced by Ashley Judd . The film ended up becoming the critically panned Catwoman ( 2004 ) , starring Halle Berry .

 = Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut , BWV 199 = 
 Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut ( English : My heart swims in blood ) BWV 199 , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach . He composed the solo cantata for soprano in Weimar between 1711 and 1714 , and performed it on the eleventh Sunday after Trinity , 12 August 1714 . 
 The text was written by Georg Christian Lehms and published in Darmstadt in 1711 in the collection Gottgefälliges Kirchen @-@ Opffer , on the general topic of a looking for redemption . The librettist wrote a series of alternating recitatives and arias , and included as movement 6 of 8 the third stanza of Johann Heermann 's hymn " Wo soll ich fliehen hin " . It is not known when Bach composed the work , but he performed it as part of his monthly cantata productions on the eleventh Sunday after Trinity , 12 August 1714 . The solo voice is accompanied by a chamber orchestra of oboe , strings and continuo . The singer expresses in a style similar to Baroque opera the dramatic development from feeling like a " monster in God 's eyes " to being forgiven . Bach revised the work for later performances , leading to three different editions in the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe . 
 = = History and words = = 
 On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed concertmaster of the Weimar court orchestra ( Kapelle ) of the co @-@ reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe @-@ Weimar . As concertmaster , he assumed the principal responsibility for composing new works , specifically cantatas for the Schlosskirche ( palace church ) , on a monthly schedule . He performed the cantata on the eleventh Sunday after Trinity as the fifth cantata of the series , following Weinen , Klagen , Sorgen , Zagen , BWV 12 . The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the First Epistle to the Corinthians , on the gospel of Christ and his ( Paul 's ) duty as an apostle ( 1 Corinthians 15 : 1 – 10 ) , and from the Gospel of Luke , the parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector ( Luke 18 : 9 – 14 ) . 
 The text , which concerns a sinner seeking and finding redemption , was written by Georg Christian Lehms . Lehms was based in Darmstadt , and it is not known whether Bach knew him personally , but he may well have had access to Lehms 's 1711 publication Gottgefälliges Kirchen @-@ Opffer , which includes this text and that of another solo cantata , Widerstehe doch der Sünde , BWV 54 , performed the month before . The third stanza of Johann Heermann 's hymn " Wo soll ich fliehen hin " is integrated as movement 6 . The text in the first person shows the dramatic change of a person initially feeling as " a monster in God 's eyes " to finally feeling accepted as God 's child . The cantata text was set to music in 1712 by Christoph Graupner in Darmstadt . It is not known if Bach knew of Graupner 's composition . The text has no specific relation to the prescribed readings , therefore it is possible that Bach may have already composed the work before his promotion to concert master with regular Sunday services , like the other cantata on a text by Lehms . 
 Bach first performed the cantata on 12 August 1714 . When he performed it again in Leipzig on the eleventh Sunday after Trinity in 1723 ( 8 August ) it was the first solo cantata and the most operatic work which he had presented to the congregation up to that point . He made revisions for that performance , such as transposing it from C minor to D minor and changing the obbligato viola to violoncello piccolo . In the same service , he also performed a new work , Siehe zu , daß deine <unk> nicht <unk> sei , BWV 179 : one before and one after the sermon . 
 The Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe recognises three distinct versions : the Weimar version , a Köthen version , and the Leipzig version . 
 = = Scoring and structure = = 
 The cantata , structured in eight movements , is scored as chamber music for a solo soprano voice ( S ) , oboe ( Ob ) , violins ( Vl ) , viola ( Va ) , and basso continuo ( Bc ) including bassoon ( Fg ) and violone ( Vo ) . In the Weimar version , it is in C minor , with a viola as the obbligato instrument in movement 6 . The title page of the parts for this version reads : " Geistliche Cantate / Mein Herze <unk> im Blut / â / Soprano solo / 1 Hautb . / 2 <unk> . / Viola / e / Basso / di / J.S.Bach " . In the Leipzig version , it is in D minor , with an obbligato violoncello piccolo instead of the viola . 
 In the following table of the movements , the scoring follows the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe . The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr , using the symbol for common time ( 4 / 4 ) . The continuo , playing throughout , is not shown . 
 = = Music = = 
 Although limited to one soprano voice , Bach achieves a variety of musical expression in the eight movements . All but one recitative are accompanied by the strings ( accompagnato ) , and only movement 5 is secco , accompanied by the continuo only . The solo voice is treated to dramatic declamation , close to contemporary opera . 
 = = = 1 = = = 
 A recitative sets the scene , " Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut " ( " My heart swims in blood " ) . 
 The musicologist Julian Mincham explains that it " drips with the self @-@ obsessed agonies of sin , pain and abandonment ... with the torment of an abandoned soul swamped by its own sin and sorrow . Its finely wrought contours portray dramatically the vacillating emotions ranging from horror and terror to lonely and dispirited resignation . " 
 = = = 2 = = = 
 The first aria , a da capo aria , " Stumme <unk> , <unk> Klagen " ( Mute sighs , silent cries ) , is accompanied by the oboe . The theme of the ritornello is present throughout the movement . The middle section begins with a dissonance to stress the sorrowful image of " Und ihr <unk> <unk> " ( " And you , moist springs of tears " ) . It ends with a passage set as a secco recitative , described by Mincham : " Time almost appears to stand still with this final expression of misery " . 
 = = = 3 = = = 
 The following recitative , " Doch Gott <unk> mir genädig sein " ( " But God must be gracious to me " ) , ends in a statement of repentance . 
 = = = 4 = = = 
 The second aria , " Tief <unk> und <unk> <unk> " ( " Deeply bowed and filled with regret " ) , is dominated by rich string sound . An adagio passage leads to the da capo . The aria expresses repentance in a " civilised and refined minuet " . 
 = = = 5 = = = 
 A short secco recitative , " Auf diese <unk> " ( " Upon this painful repentance " ) , introduces the following hymn stanza . It begins with " a musical echo of the torments of the heart swimming in blood " . 
 = = = 6 = = = 
 The only chorale stanza of the work is " Ich , dein <unk> Kind " ( " I , Your troubled child " ) , the third stanza of Johann Heermann 's " Wo soll ich fliehen hin " ( " Where should I flee " ) , published in 1630 . Its term " troubled child " is a good summary of the position of the human being in relation to God . The wording of its conclusion , " In deine <unk> Wunden , da ich <unk> Heil <unk> " ( " into Your deep wounds , where I have always found salvation " ) leads to the following recitative . The voice is accompanied by an obbligato viola ( violoncello piccolo in the Leipzig version ) in a lively figuration . 
 Bach used a rather unusual melody by Caspar von <unk> , whereas he based his later chorale cantata on this hymn on the melody by Jacob <unk> . The hymn is treated as in a chorale fantasia , with string ritornellos between the verses . 
 = = = 7 = = = 
 The last recitative , " Ich lege mich in diese Wunden " ( " I lay myself on these wounds " ) , introduces a different mood ; the final measures are a " soaring melisma " , a " joyously uplifting prelude " to the last movement . 
 = = = 8 = = = 
 The final aria , " Wie freudig ist mein Herz " ( " How joyful is my heart " ) , expresses joy as a cheerful gigue , with a long coloratura on " <unk> " ( joyful ) . It is comparable to the <unk> in Bach 's French Suites . Mincham concludes : 
 This cantata , expressed throughout in the first person , is highly personal . It makes a clear and dramatic journey from the cesspools of sinful misery to the euphoria of redemption and salvation . It has no trumpets , horns or drums to drive its message home ; they are not needed within this highly private context . " 
 = = Selected recordings = = 
 The work has been recorded often , both by Bach specialists and others . The sortable listing is taken from the selection provided by Aryeh Oron on the Bach @-@ Cantatas website , which lists 54 recordings as of 2015 .

 = Blanche Lazzell = 
 Blanche Lazzell ( October 10 , 1878 – June 1 , 1956 ) was an American painter , printmaker and designer . Known especially for her white @-@ line woodcuts , she was an early modernist American artist , bringing elements of Cubism and abstraction into her art . 
 Born in a small farming community in West Virginia , Lazzell traveled to Europe twice , studying in Paris with French artists Albert Gleizes , Fernand Léger , and André Lhote . In 1915 , she began spending her summers in the Cape Cod art community of Provincetown , Massachusetts and eventually settled there permanently . She was one of the founding members of the Provincetown Printers , a group of artists who experimented with a white @-@ line woodcut technique based on the Japanese ukiyo @-@ e woodblock prints . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life and education = = = 
 Nettie Blanche Lazzell was born October 10 , 1878 on a farm near Maidsville , West Virginia to Mary Prudence Pope and Cornelius Carhart Lazzell . Her father was a direct descendant of Reverend Thomas and Hannah Lazzell , pioneers who settled in Monongalia County after the American Revolutionary War . The <unk> were devout Methodists , attending the Bethel Methodist Episcopal Church . The ninth of ten children , she was nicknamed " Pet " by her older brother Rufus , a name that her family would continue to use throughout her life . She grew up on the 200 acre ( 0 @.@ 81 km2 ) family farm , attending a one @-@ room schoolhouse on the property where students from the first through eighth grades were taught from October through February . Her mother died when she was twelve . 
 When Lazzell was fifteen , she enrolled in the West Virginia Conference Seminary ( now West Virginia Wesleyan College ) in Buckhannon . Probably sometime prior to her entering the Seminary she became partially deaf , although the exact origin of her condition is unclear . In 1894 she sought treatment from a Baltimore doctor who blamed her deafness on catarrh . 
 In 1899 , Lazzell enrolled in the South Carolina Co @-@ educational Institute . Upon graduation later that year , she became a teacher at the Red Oaks School in Ramsey , South Carolina . In spring of 1900 , she returned to Maidsville , where she tutored her younger sister , Bessie . 
 Lazzell was matriculated into the West Virginia University ( WVU ) in 1901 and decided to study fine art . While her education was paid for by her father , she kept a strict account of her expenditures and took a job coloring photographs at <unk> , a studio in Morgantown . She took drawing and art history classes from William J. Leonard and studied with Eva E. Hubbard . In June 1905 Lazzell was graduated , earning her degree in fine arts . She continued to study at WVU off and on until 1909 , furthering her art studies and twice substituting as a painting teacher for Hubbard . During this time she learned ceramics , gold etching , and china decoration . 
 She enrolled in the Art Students League of New York in 1908 where she studied under painters Kenyon Cox and William Merritt Chase . Georgia O 'Keeffe attended the league during the same period , but it is not clear whether the two attended classes together . In 1908 , Lazzell 's father died and she left the Art Students League . 
 = = = Travels to Europe = = = 
 Lazzell boarded the SS Ivernia on July 3 , 1912 bound for Europe on a summer tour arranged by the American Travel Club . The tour began in England and continued through the Netherlands , Belgium , and Italy , where Lazzell studied the architecture of churches . In August she left the tour and traveled to Paris , where she stayed at a pension in Montparnasse on the Left Bank . She attended lectures by Florence Heywood and Rossiter Howard , avoided the cafe life , and joined the Students Hostel on Boulevard Saint @-@ Michel . While in Paris , Lazzell took classes at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière , Académie Julian , and Académie <unk> , eventually settling in at the Académie Moderne where she studied with post @-@ impressionist painter Charles Guérin and David Rosen . Lazzell felt most comfortable at the Moderne , which was associated with the Parisian avant @-@ garde . She embarked upon a six @-@ week sketching tour of Italy with four other young women in February 1913 . The quintet returned to Paris via Germany where Lazzell partook in her first glass of beer in Munich . In April she visited an ear specialist who removed a growth from the back of her throat , resulting in what she characterized as " a slight improvement " in her hearing . She continued to study with Guérin , who recognized Lazzell 's inclination for landscape art . Lazzell extended her stay in France and attended lectures at the Louvre concerning Flemish paintings , Dutch art and the Italian Renaissance . She returned to the United States at the end of September , sailing from London on the SS Arabic of the White Star Line . 
 Upon returning to Morgantown , Lazzell focused on painting and lived with her sister Bessie . She held a solo exhibition in December 1914 that included her sketches and paintings . Lazzell rented a studio where she taught art while supporting herself through the sales of hand @-@ painted china . 
 = = = Provincetown = = = 
 Lacking artistic stimulation in Morgantown , Lazzell journeyed to Provincetown , Massachusetts in 1915 . Already an artists ' colony , Provincetown was a mecca for European artists escaping World War I. Stella Johnson and Jessie Fremont Herring , two of Lazzell 's companions from her tour in Italy , were already in Provincetown and Lazzell stayed with Johnson 's mother . Lazzell took a morning outdoor painting class that summer from Charles Webster Hawthorne at his Cape Cod School of Art where she was exposed to Fauvist color and technique . She returned to Morgantown in the autumn and held an exhibition in her studio that October . 
 Lazzell returned to Provincetown the following summer and requested that painting instructor , Oliver Chaffee , teach her the white @-@ line woodcut technique innovated by Arthur Wesley Dow and adopted by a group of artists who had spent the previous winter in Provincetown . The white @-@ line woodcuts were inspired by Japanese ukiyo @-@ e woodblock prints , but only used a single block of wood . Designs were etched into the surface of woodblocks , with the incised lines separating sections of the blocks . The sections were individually painted and printed onto paper with the carved portions forming white lines . Lazzell and other artists specializing in the white @-@ line technique formed the Provincetown Printers , an artist collective that later would earn national recognition . Toward the close of 1916 she traveled to Manhattan where she studied with Homer Boss and did an analysis of color with William E. Schumacher . Two of her pieces in the white @-@ line style were exhibited in the Provincetown Art Association 's annual show in 1917 . 
 Originality , Simplicity , Freedom of Expression , and above all Sincerity , with a clean cut block , are characteristics of a good wood block print . 
 In the summer of 1917 , she spent time at Byrdcliffe Colony , an artists ' colony in Woodstock , New York . There she studied with William Schumacher , under whom she made her first color woodcut . She also studied with William Zorach and Andrew Dasburg . In the summer of 1918 Lazzell moved to Provincetown permanently , converting an old fish house overlooking the Provincetown Harbor into a studio . She spent the winters in Morgantown and Manhattan until 1922 , always returning to Provincetown for the summer . In addition to her involvement with the Provincetown Printers , Lazzell was a member of the Provincetown Art Association and the Sail Loft Club , Provincetown 's women 's art club . 
 Although the bohemian atmosphere of Provincetown contrasted with Lazzell 's church @-@ going conservative demeanor , she wove herself into a tight circle of friends , including Ada Gilmore , Agnes <unk> , and Otto Karl <unk> . She became close to Simeon C. Smith , a former WVU English professor who had retired to Provincetown . She spent Thanksgiving with his family in 1918 and while the couple became romantically entangled , they never married . 
 In 1919 Lazzell was featured in an exhibition in Manhattan at the Touchstone Gallery alongside <unk> , Mary <unk> , and Flora Schoenfeld . Later that year , the Provincetown Printers were featured at the Detroit Institute of Arts exhibition " Wood Block Prints in Color by American Artists " . That show included Lazzell 's depiction of the Monongahela River in Morgantown The Monongahela , which was cut at Byrdcliffe in William E. Schumacher 's studio . Critics and galleries associated the Provincetown Printers with modernist schools of painting and the artist collective continued to receive national exposure over the next few years with exhibitions in Chicago , Los Angeles , Philadelphia , Baltimore , and New Orleans . 
 Lazzell turned her old fish shack into a personal space and built large flower boxes around her studio , allowing morning glory and Madeira vines to grow up to the roof . Her studio 's garden became a local attraction and she hosted teas for which she made homemade candy . During this time Lazzell produced white @-@ line prints and flower <unk> and she taught painting and block printing classes . 
 = = = Return to Europe = = = 
 Lazzell returned to Europe in 1923 with <unk> and <unk> , touring Italy and spending two months in Cassis before settling in Paris late that summer . Her friend Flora Schoenfeld convinced her to dye her hair red in the fashion of many women in their circle . While in Paris Lazzell studied Cubism and geometric abstraction alongside Fernand Léger , André Lhote , and Albert Gleizes . Lazzell 's work was exhibited at the Salon d 'Automne and the American Women 's Club in 1923 . She returned to Morgantown in August 1924 after her sister Bessie had given birth to a son . 
 = = = Later years = = = 
 Lazzell grew close to her niece , Frances Reed , for whom she was a mentor and role model . For six years she served on the committee of selection for the Annual Modern Exhibition . After her return to Provincetown in 1926 , Lazzell tore down her studio and had a new building constructed , as the fish house was too cold during the winter . She participated in a show called " Fifty Prints of the Year " where she debuted her compositions The Violet Jug and Trees . She was particularly influenced by Gleizes and produced a series of abstract Synthetic cubist paintings based on the golden ratio , including Painting VIII . 
 Lazzell was a member of the international arts group Société Anonyme and was asked by artist and patron Katherine Dreier to be on its board of directors in 1928 . Lazzell later joined the New York Society of Women Artists and the Society of Independent Artists . Lazzell began incorporating abstract designs into her woodblocks and created designs for hooked rugs toward the end of the decade . She returned to Morgantown in the winter of 1929 and offered art lessons . Among her students was Ella Sophonisba Hergesheimer . 
 In 1934 , Lazzell was one of two West Virginians who received Federal Art Project grants through the Works Progress Administration . That same year she created a mural for a court room in the Monongalia County Courthouse entitled , Justice . The mural took fourteen weeks to complete . The mural is currently displayed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University in Morgantown , WV . She continued experimenting with <unk> and , in 1935 , studied with the renowned German abstract expressionist Hans Hofmann in Provincetown . Hofmann 's push / pull spatial theory is evident in the asymmetry of her later works . Lazzell 's studies of flowers were inspired by her lavish potted gardens , such as Star Phlox ( 1931 ) . Her 1948 floral print , Red and White Petunia , won first prize at the American Color Print Society exhibition . A collection of her prints are housed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University . 
 In 1956 , Lazzell 's health began to fail and she was hospitalized in Bourne , Massachusetts toward the end of May for a suspected stroke . After suffering a documented stroke , Lazzell died on June 1 . She is interred next to her father in Bethel Cemetery in Maidsville . 
 = = Artistic style = = 
 While Lazzell is most well known for her white @-@ line woodcuts , she also created ceramics , hooked rugs , paintings , and gouache studies . The subjects of her paintings and prints included landscape scenery and harbor scenes in Provincetown as well as flowers and still lifes . These and her abstract works incorporated elements of both Synthetic and Analytic cubism and frequently comprised arrangements of vibrantly colored geometric shapes . She was among the earliest women artists in the United States to work in a modernist style . 
 Lazzell 's paintings demonstrated a rich and nuanced use of color . She preferred French watercolor pigments that , alongside the grain of the woodblocks , created embossed lines and striated patterns . Typically the woodblocks she created were made from cherry or basswood and she only pulled three or four prints from each woodblock . From 1916 to 1955 , Lazzell created 138 woodblocks . Modern exhibitions of Lazzell 's artworks have included the woodblocks themselves . 
 Although she was a pioneer in the white @-@ line woodcut technique and played a role in the development of abstract art in the United States , Lazzell 's work faded into obscurity for a time . With a resurgence of interest in the modern print , and especially the white @-@ line woodcut , Lazzell 's popularity has surged lately . On August 3 , 2012 Lazzell 's print ' Sail Boat ' reached a staggering $ 106 @,@ 200 at auction . 
 = German destroyer Z9 Wolfgang Zenker = 
 Z9 Wolfgang Zenker was a Type 1934A @-@ class destroyer built for Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine in the mid @-@ 1930s . Several days after the start of World War II , she unsuccessfully attacked , together with another destroyer , Polish ships anchored at the naval base on the Hel Peninsula . In early 1940 the ship made two successful minelaying sorties off the English coast that claimed six merchant ships . Wolfgang Zenker participated in the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign by transporting troops to the Narvik area in early April 1940 . The ship fought in both naval Battles of Narvik several days later and had to be scuttled after she exhausted her ammunition . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Wolfgang Zenker had an overall length of 119 meters ( 390 ft 5 in ) and was 114 meters ( 374 ft 0 in ) long at the waterline . The ship had a beam of 11 @.@ 30 meters ( 37 ft 1 in ) , and a maximum draft of 4 @.@ 23 meters ( 13 ft 11 in ) . She displaced 2 @,@ 171 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 137 long tons ) at standard and 3 @,@ 110 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 060 long tons ) at deep load . The Wagner geared steam turbines were designed to produce 70 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 51 @,@ 000 kW ; 69 @,@ 000 shp ) which would propel the ship at 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . Steam was provided to the turbines by six high @-@ pressure Benson boilers with superheaters . Wolfgang Zenker carried a maximum of 752 metric tons ( 740 long tons ) of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4 @,@ 400 nmi ( 8 @,@ 100 km ; 5 @,@ 100 mi ) at 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) , but the ship proved top @-@ heavy in service and 30 % of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship . The effective range proved to be only 1 @,@ 530 nmi ( 2 @,@ 830 km ; 1 @,@ 760 mi ) at 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . 
 Wolfgang Zenker carried five 12 @.@ 7 cm SK C / 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields , two each superimposed , fore and aft . The fifth gun was carried on top of the rear deckhouse . Her anti @-@ aircraft armament consisted of four 3 @.@ 7 cm SK C / 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 cm C / 30 guns in single mounts . The ship carried eight above @-@ water 53 @.@ 3 @-@ centimeter ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes in two power @-@ operated mounts . A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount . Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern . Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each . Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines . ' GHG ' ( German : Gruppenhorchgerät ) passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines . 
 = = Career = = 
 The ship was ordered on 9 January 1935 and laid down at Germania , Kiel on 22 March 1935 as yard number <unk> . She was launched on 27 March 1936 and completed on 2 July 1937 . Wolfgang Zenker participated in the August 1938 Fleet Review as part of the 6th Destroyer Division and the following fleet exercise . On the morning of 3 September 1939 , after the start of World War II , the destroyers Leberecht Maass and Wolfgang Zenker , under the command of Rear Admiral Günther Lütjens , attacked the Polish destroyer Wicher and the minelayer Gryf as they laid anchored in the naval base on the Hel Peninsula . The German ships opened fire at a range of 12 @,@ 700 meters ( 13 @,@ 900 yd ) . The Polish ships , as well as a coast defense battery of 15 @-@ centimeter ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) replied effectively and forced the German destroyers to make evasive maneuvers and to lay a smoke screen to throw off the aim of the Polish gunners . A 15 @-@ centimeter shell struck Leberecht Maass , killing four men and disabling one gun . Admiral <unk> ordered the action broken off 40 minutes later as the German fire was ineffective . 
 Although the other destroyers were busy escorting the German heavy ships and laying minefields off the British coast , Wolfgang Zenker played no part of any of these operations until the night of 10 / 11 January 1940 when she laid a minefield off Cromer with her sisters Bruno Heinemann and Erich Koellner . Three ships totaling 11 @,@ 155 Gross Register Tons ( GRT ) were sunk by this minefield . The same three ships made another sortie on the night of 9 / 10 February into the same area and laid 157 mines that claimed three ships totaling 11 @,@ 855 GRT . Wolfgang Zenker suffered ice damage in mid @-@ February and was forced to return prematurely when she was escorting the battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst when they attempted to intercept British convoys to Scandinavia . 
 Wolfgang Zenker was allocated to Group 1 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserübung . The group 's task was to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment ( 139 . Gebirgsjäger Regiment ) and the headquarters of the 3rd Mountain Division ( 3 . Gebirgs @-@ Division ) to seize Narvik . The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day . When they arrived at the Ofotfjord , west of Narvik , on the early morning of 9 April , the three ships of the 4th Flotilla , under the command of Commander Erich Bey , were ordered to land their troops in the Herjangsfjord ( a northern branch of the Ofotfjord ) in order to capture a Norwegian Army armory at Elvegårdsmoen . The troops encountered little resistance , but off @-@ loading them was slow because there was only a single wooden pier available . Wolfgang Zenker was able to partially refuel during the following night , but returned to the Herjansfjord well before dawn . 
 Shortly before dawn on 10 April , the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla surprised the German ships in Narvik harbor . They torpedoed two destroyers and badly damaged the other three while suffering only minor damage themselves . As they were beginning to withdraw they encountered the three destroyers of the 4th Flotilla which had been alerted when the British began their attack . The Germans opened fire first , but the gunnery for both sides was not effective due to the mist and the smoke screen laid by the British as they retreated down the Ofotfjord . The German ships had to turn away to avoid a salvo of three torpedoes fired by one of the destroyers in Narvik . Commander Bey 's other two ships were very low on fuel and all three were running low on ammunition , so he decided not to continue the pursuit of the British ships since they were being engaged by the last two destroyers of Group 1 . 
 Commander Bey was ordered during the afternoon of 10 April to return to Germany with all seaworthy ships that evening . Only Wolfgang Zenker and her sister Erich Giese were ready for sea and they slipped out of the Ofotfjord and turned south . Visibility was good that evening and they spotted the light cruiser HMS Penelope and her two escorting destroyers and Commander Bey decided to turn back even though his ships had not been spotted by the British . Three other destroyers refuelled and completed their repairs on 11 April , but Bey decided against another breakout attempt despite the fog and poor visibility that night . While at anchor , Wolfgang Zenker briefly grounded during the night and damaged her port propeller , which limited her speed to 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . Bey made no attempt to breakout during the night of 12 / 13 April . 
 That night he received word to expect an attack the following day by British capital ships escorted by a large number of destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft . Wolfgang Zenker was still under repair , although her torpedoes had been replenished from the damaged destroyers . The battleship HMS Warspite and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April , although earlier than Commander Bey had expected , and caught the Germans out of position . The five operable destroyers , including Wolfgang Zenker , charged out of Narvik harbor and engaged the British ships . Although no hits were scored , they did inflict splinter damage on several of the destroyers . Wolfgang Zenker was able to make a torpedo attack on Warspite before being driven off , but her torpedoes all missed . Lack of ammunition forced the German ships to retreat to the Rombaksfjorden ( the easternmost branch of the Ofotfjord ) , east of Narvik , where they might attempt to ambush pursuing British destroyers . Wolfgang Zenker had exhausted her ammunition and she was beached at the head of the fjord . Her crew placed demolition charges and abandoned the ship . By the time the British reached the ship she had rolled over onto her side . 
 = Jimi Hendrix = 
 James Marshall " Jimi " Hendrix ( born Johnny Allen Hendrix ; November 27 , 1942 – September 18 , 1970 ) was an American rock guitarist , singer , and songwriter . Although his mainstream career spanned only four years , he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music , and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century . The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as " arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music " . 
 Born in Seattle , Washington , Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15 . In 1961 , he enlisted in the US Army and trained as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division ; he was granted an honorable discharge the following year . Soon afterward , he moved to Clarksville , Tennessee , and began playing gigs on the chitlin ' circuit , earning a place in the Isley Brothers ' backing band and later with Little Richard , with whom he continued to work through mid @-@ 1965 . He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered by Linda Keith , who in turn interested bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals in becoming his first manager . Within months , Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience : " Hey Joe " , " Purple Haze " , and " The Wind Cries Mary " . He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 , and in 1968 his third and final studio album , Electric Ladyland , reached number one in the US ; it was Hendrix 's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album . The world 's highest @-@ paid performer , he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 before his accidental death from barbiturate @-@ related asphyxia on September 18 , 1970 , at the age of 27 . 
 Hendrix was inspired musically by American rock and roll and electric blues . He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain , and was instrumental in utilizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback . He helped to popularize the use of a wah @-@ wah pedal in mainstream rock , and was the first artist to use stereophonic phasing effects in music recordings . Holly George @-@ Warren of Rolling Stone commented : " Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source . Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion , but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled , fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began . " 
 Hendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously . In 1967 , readers of Melody Maker voted him the Pop Musician of the Year , and in 1968 , Rolling Stone declared him the Performer of the Year . Disc and Music Echo honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970 , Guitar Player named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year . The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 . Rolling Stone ranked the band 's three studio albums , Are You Experienced , Axis : Bold as Love , and Electric Ladyland , among the 100 greatest albums of all time , and they ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth greatest artist of all time . 
 = = Ancestry and childhood = = 
 Jimi Hendrix was of African @-@ American descent . Both his mother Lucille and father Al were African @-@ Americans . His paternal grandmother , <unk> " Nora " Rose Moore , was African @-@ American and one @-@ quarter Cherokee . Hendrix 's paternal grandfather , Bertran Philander Ross Hendrix ( born 1866 ) , was the result of an extramarital affair between a woman named Fanny , and a grain merchant from Urbana , Ohio or Illinois , one of the wealthiest men in the area at that time . On June 10 , 1919 , Hendrix and Moore had a son they named James Allen Ross Hendrix ; people called him Al . 
 In 1941 , Al met Lucille Jeter ( 1925 – 1958 ) at a dance in Seattle ; they married on March 31 , 1942 . Al , who had been drafted by the U.S. Army to serve in World War II , left to begin his basic training three days after the wedding . Johnny Allen Hendrix was born on November 27 , 1942 , in Seattle , Washington ; he was the first of Lucille 's five children . In 1946 , Johnny 's parents changed his name to James Marshall Hendrix , in honor of Al and his late brother Leon Marshall . 
 Stationed in Alabama at the time of Hendrix 's birth , Al was denied the standard military furlough afforded servicemen for childbirth ; his commanding officer placed him in the stockade to prevent him from going AWOL to see his infant son in Seattle . He spent two months locked up without trial , and while in the stockade received a telegram announcing his son 's birth . During Al 's three @-@ year absence , Lucille struggled to raise their son . When Al was away , Hendrix was mostly cared for by family members and friends , especially Lucille 's sister Delores Hall and her friend Dorothy Harding . Al received an honorable discharge from the US Army on September 1 , 1945 . Two months later , unable to find Lucille , Al went to the Berkeley , California home of a family friend named Mrs. Champ , who had taken care of and had attempted to adopt Hendrix ; this is where Al saw his son for the first time . 
 After returning from service , Al reunited with Lucille , but his inability to find steady work left the family impoverished . They both struggled with alcohol , and often fought when intoxicated . The violence sometimes drove Hendrix to withdraw and hide in a closet in their home . His relationship with his brother Leon ( born 1948 ) was close but precarious ; with Leon in and out of foster care , they lived with an almost constant threat of fraternal separation . In addition to Leon , Hendrix had three younger siblings : Joseph , born in 1949 , Kathy in 1950 , and Pamela , 1951 , all of whom Al and Lucille gave up to foster care and adoption . The family frequently moved , staying in cheap hotels and apartments around Seattle . On occasion , family members would take Hendrix to Vancouver to stay at his grandmother 's . A shy and sensitive boy , he was deeply affected by his life experiences . In later years , he confided to a girlfriend that he had been the victim of sexual abuse by a man in uniform . On December 17 , 1951 , when Hendrix was nine years old , his parents divorced ; the court granted Al custody of him and Leon . 
 = = First instruments = = 
 At Horace Mann Elementary School in Seattle during the mid @-@ 1950s , Hendrix 's habit of carrying a broom with him to emulate a guitar gained the attention of the school 's social worker . After more than a year of his clinging to a broom like a security blanket , she wrote a letter requesting school funding intended for underprivileged children , insisting that leaving him without a guitar might result in psychological damage . Her efforts failed , and Al refused to buy him a guitar . 
 In 1957 , while helping his father with a side @-@ job , Hendrix found a ukulele amongst the garbage that they were removing from an older woman 's home . She told him that he could keep the instrument , which had only one string . Learning by ear , he played single notes , following along to Elvis Presley songs , particularly Presley 's cover of Leiber and Stoller 's " Hound Dog " . By the age of thirty @-@ three , Hendrix 's mother Lucille had developed cirrhosis of the liver , and on February 2 , 1958 , she died when her spleen ruptured . Al refused to take James and Leon to attend their mother 's funeral ; he instead gave them shots of whiskey and instructed them that was how men were supposed to deal with loss . In mid @-@ 1958 , at age 15 , Hendrix acquired his first acoustic guitar , for $ 5 . He earnestly applied himself , playing the instrument for several hours daily , watching others and getting tips from more experienced guitarists , and listening to blues artists such as Muddy Waters , B.B. King , Howlin ' Wolf , and Robert Johnson . The first tune Hendrix learned how to play was the theme from Peter Gunn . 
 Soon after he acquired the acoustic guitar , Hendrix formed his first band , the <unk> . Without an electric guitar , he could barely be heard over the sound of the group . After about three months , he realized that he needed an electric guitar in order to continue . In mid @-@ 1959 , his father relented and bought him a white <unk> Ozark . Hendrix 's first gig was with an unnamed band in the basement of a synagogue , Seattle 's Temple De Hirsch , but after too much showing off , the band fired him between sets . He later joined the Rocking Kings , which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club . When someone stole his guitar after he left it backstage overnight , Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro . In 1958 , Hendrix completed his studies at Washington Junior High School , though he did not graduate from Garfield High School . 
 = = Military service = = 
 Before Hendrix was 19 years old , law enforcement authorities had twice caught him riding in stolen cars . When given a choice between spending time in prison or joining the Army , he chose the latter and enlisted on May 31 , 1961 . After completing eight weeks of basic training at Fort Ord , California , he was assigned to the 101st Airborne Division and stationed at Fort Campbell , Kentucky . He arrived there on November 8 , and soon afterward he wrote to his father : " There 's nothing but physical training and harassment here for two weeks , then when you go to jump school ... you get hell . They work you to death , fussing and fighting . " In his next letter home , Hendrix , who had left his guitar at his girlfriend Betty Jean Morgan 's house in Seattle , asked his father to send it to him as soon as possible , stating : " I really need it now . " His father obliged and sent the red Silvertone Danelectro on which Hendrix had hand @-@ painted the words " Betty Jean " , to Fort Campbell . His apparent obsession with the instrument contributed to his neglect of his duties , which led to verbal taunting and physical abuse from his peers , who at least once hid the guitar from him until he had begged for its return . 
 In November 1961 , fellow serviceman Billy Cox walked past an army club and heard Hendrix playing guitar . Intrigued by the proficient playing , which he described as a combination of " John Lee Hooker and Beethoven " , Cox borrowed a bass guitar and the two jammed . Within a few weeks , they began performing at base clubs on the weekends with other musicians in a loosely organized band called the Casuals . 
 Hendrix completed his paratrooper training in just over eight months , and Major General C. W. G. Rich awarded him the prestigious Screaming Eagles patch on January 11 , 1962 . By February , his personal conduct had begun to draw criticism from his superiors . They labeled him an unqualified marksman and often caught him napping while on duty and failing to report for bed checks . On May 24 , Hendrix 's platoon sergeant , James C. Spears , filed a report in which he stated : " He has no interest whatsoever in the Army ... It is my opinion that Private Hendrix will never come up to the standards required of a soldier . I feel that the military service will benefit if he is discharged as soon as possible . " On June 29 , 1962 , Captain Gilbert <unk> granted Hendrix an honorable discharge on the basis of unsuitability . Hendrix later spoke of his dislike of the army and falsely stated that he had received a medical discharge after breaking his ankle during his 26th parachute jump .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 In September 1963 , after Cox was discharged from the Army , he and Hendrix moved to Clarksville , Tennessee and formed a band called the King <unk> . Hendrix had watched Butch Snipes play with his teeth in Seattle and by now Alphonso ' Baby Boo ' Young , the other guitarist in the band , was performing this guitar gimmick . Not to be upstaged , Hendrix learned to play with his teeth . He later commented : " The idea of doing that came to me ... in Tennessee . Down there you have to play with your teeth or else you get shot . There 's a trail of broken teeth all over the stage . " Although they began playing low @-@ paying gigs at obscure venues , the band eventually moved to Nashville 's Jefferson Street , which was the traditional heart of the city 's black community and home to a thriving rhythm and blues music scene . They earned a brief residency playing at a popular venue in town , the Club del Morocco , and for the next two years Hendrix made a living performing at a circuit of venues throughout the South who were affiliated with the Theater Owners ' Booking Association ( <unk> ) , widely known as the Chitlin ' Circuit . In addition to playing in his own band , Hendrix performed as a backing musician for various soul , R & B , and blues musicians , including Wilson Pickett , Slim Harpo , Sam Cooke , and Jackie Wilson . 
 In January 1964 , feeling he had outgrown the circuit artistically and frustrated by having to follow the rules of bandleaders , Hendrix decided to venture out on his own . He moved into the Hotel Theresa in Harlem , where he befriended <unk> <unk> , known as " Faye " , who became his girlfriend . A Harlem native with connections throughout the area 's music scene , <unk> provided him with shelter , support , and encouragement . Hendrix also met the Allen twins , Arthur and Albert . In February 1964 , Hendrix won first prize in the Apollo Theater amateur contest . Hoping to secure a career opportunity , he played the Harlem club circuit and sat in with various bands . At the recommendation of a former associate of Joe Tex , Ronnie Isley granted Hendrix an audition that led to an offer to become the guitarist with the Isley Brothers ' back @-@ up band , the <unk> Specials , which he readily accepted . 
 = = = First recordings = = = 
 In March 1964 , Hendrix recorded the two @-@ part single " Testify " with the Isley Brothers . Released in June , it failed to chart . In May , he provided guitar instrumentation for the Don Covay song , " Mercy Mercy " . Issued in August by Rosemart Records and distributed by Atlantic , the track reached number 35 on the Billboard chart . 
 Hendrix toured with the <unk> during much of 1964 , but near the end of October , after growing tired of playing the same set every night , he left the band . Soon afterward , Hendrix joined Little Richard 's touring band , the Upsetters . During a stop in Los Angeles in February 1965 , he recorded his first and only single with Richard , " I Don 't Know What You Got ( But It 's Got Me ) " , written by Don Covay and released by Vee @-@ Jay Records . Richard 's popularity was waning at the time , and the single peaked at number 92 , where it remained for one week before dropping off the chart . Hendrix met singer Rosa Lee Brooks while staying at the Wilcox Hotel in Hollywood , and she invited him to participate in a recording session for her single , which included the Arthur Lee penned " My Diary " as the A @-@ side , and " <unk> " as the B @-@ side . Hendrix played guitar on both tracks , which also included background vocals by Lee . The single failed to chart , but Hendrix and Lee began a friendship that lasted several years ; Hendrix later became an ardent supporter of Lee 's band , Love . 
 In July 1965 , on Nashville 's Channel 5 Night Train , Hendrix made his first television appearance . Performing in Little Richard 's ensemble band , he backed up vocalists Buddy and Stacy on " Shotgun " . The video recording of the show marks the earliest known footage of Hendrix performing . Richard and Hendrix often clashed over tardiness , wardrobe , and Hendrix 's stage antics , and in late July , Richard 's brother Robert fired him . He then briefly rejoined the Isley Brothers , and recorded a second single with them , " Move Over and Let Me Dance " backed with " Have You Ever Been Disappointed " . Later that year , he joined a New York @-@ based R & B band , Curtis Knight and the Squires , after meeting Knight in the lobby of a hotel where both men were staying . Hendrix performed with them for eight months . In October 1965 , he and Knight recorded the single , " How Would You Feel " backed with " Welcome Home " and on October 15 , Hendrix signed a three @-@ year recording contract with entrepreneur Ed Chalpin . While the relationship with Chalpin was short @-@ lived , his contract remained in force , which later caused legal and career problems for Hendrix . During his time with Knight , Hendrix briefly toured with Joey Dee and the <unk> , and worked with King Curtis on several recordings including Ray Sharpe 's two @-@ part single , " Help Me " . Hendrix earned his first composer credits for two instrumentals , " Hornets Nest " and " Knock Yourself Out " , released as a Curtis Knight and the Squires single in 1966 . 
 Feeling restricted by his experiences as an R & B sideman , Hendrix moved to New York City 's Greenwich Village in 1966 , which had a vibrant and diverse music scene . There , he was offered a residency at the Cafe Wha ? on MacDougal Street and formed his own band that June , Jimmy James and the Blue Flames , which included future Spirit guitarist Randy California . The Blue Flames played at several clubs in New York and Hendrix began developing his guitar style and material that he would soon use with the Experience . In September , they gave some of their last concerts at the Cafe au Go Go , as John Hammond Jr . ' s backing group .

 By May 1966 , Hendrix was struggling to earn a living wage playing the R & B circuit , so he briefly rejoined Curtis Knight and the Squires for an engagement at one of New York City 's most popular nightspots , the Cheetah Club . During a performance , Linda Keith , the girlfriend of Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards , noticed Hendrix . She remembered : " [ His ] playing mesmerised me " . She invited him to join her for a drink ; he accepted and the two became friends . 
 While he was playing with Jimmy James and the Blue Flames , Keith recommended Hendrix to Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham and producer Seymour Stein . They failed to see Hendrix 's musical potential , and rejected him . She then referred him to Chas Chandler , who was leaving the Animals and interested in managing and producing artists . Chandler liked the Billy Roberts song " Hey Joe " , and was convinced he could create a hit single with the right artist . Impressed with Hendrix 's version of the song , he brought him to London on September 24 , 1966 , and signed him to a management and production contract with himself and ex @-@ Animals manager Michael Jeffery . On September 24 , Hendrix gave an impromptu solo performance at The Scotch of St James , and later that night he began a relationship with Kathy Etchingham that lasted for two and a half years . 
 Following Hendrix 's arrival in London , Chandler began recruiting members for a band designed to highlight the guitarist 's talents , the Jimi Hendrix Experience . Hendrix met guitarist Noel Redding at an audition for the New Animals , where Redding 's knowledge of blues progressions impressed Hendrix , who stated that he also liked Redding 's hairstyle . Chandler asked Redding if he wanted to play bass guitar in Hendrix 's band ; Redding agreed . Chandler then began looking for a drummer and soon after , he contacted Mitch Mitchell through a mutual friend . Mitchell , who had recently been fired from Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames , participated in a rehearsal with Redding and Hendrix where they found common ground in their shared interest in rhythm and blues . When Chandler phoned Mitchell later that day to offer him the position , he readily accepted . Chandler also convinced Hendrix to change the spelling of his first name from Jimmy to the exotic looking Jimi . 
 On September 30 , Chandler brought Hendrix to the London Polytechnic at Regent Street , where Cream was scheduled to perform , and where Hendrix and Eric Clapton met . Clapton later commented : " He asked if he could play a couple of numbers . I said , ' Of course ' , but I had a funny feeling about him . " Halfway through Cream 's set , Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin ' Wolf song " Killing Floor " . In 1989 , Clapton described the performance : " He played just about every style you could think of , and not in a flashy way . I mean he did a few of his tricks , like playing with his teeth and behind his back , but it wasn 't in an upstaging sense at all , and that was it ... He walked off , and my life was never the same again " .

 In mid @-@ October 1966 , Chandler arranged an engagement for the Experience as Johnny Hallyday 's supporting act during a brief tour of France . Thus , the Jimi Hendrix Experience performed their very first show on October 13 , 1966 , at the Novelty in Evreux . Their enthusiastically received 15 @-@ minute performance at the Olympia theatre in Paris on October 18 marks the earliest known recording of the band . In late October , Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp , managers of the Who , signed the Experience to their newly formed label , Track Records , which released the Experience 's first single on October 23 . " Hey Joe " , which included a female chorus provided by the Breakaways , was backed by Hendrix 's first songwriting effort after arriving in England , " Stone Free " . 
 In mid @-@ November , they performed at the Bag O 'Nails nightclub in London , with Clapton , John Lennon , Paul McCartney , Jeff Beck , Pete Townshend , Brian Jones , Mick Jagger , and Kevin Ayers in attendance . Ayers described the crowd 's reaction as stunned disbelief : " All the stars were there , and I heard serious comments , you know ' shit ' , ' Jesus ' , ' damn ' and other words worse than that . " The successful performance earned Hendrix his first interview , published in Record Mirror with the headline : " Mr. Phenomenon " . " Now hear this ... we predict that [ Hendrix ] is going to whirl around the business like a tornado " , wrote Bill Harry , who asked the rhetorical question : " Is that full , big , swinging sound really being created by only three people ? " Hendrix commented : " We don 't want to be classed in any category ... If it must have a tag , I 'd like it to be called , ' Free Feeling ' . It 's a mixture of rock , freak @-@ out , rave and blues " . After appearances on the UK television shows Ready Steady Go ! and the Top of the Pops , " Hey Joe " entered the UK charts on December 29 , 1966 , peaking at number six . Further success came in March 1967 with the UK number three hit " Purple Haze " , and in May with " The Wind Cries Mary " , which remained on the UK charts for eleven weeks , peaking at number six . 
 On March 31 , 1967 , while the Experience waited to perform at the London Astoria , Hendrix and Chandler discussed ways in which they could increase the band 's media exposure . When Chandler asked journalist Keith Altham for advice , Altham suggested that they needed to do something more dramatic than the stage show of the Who , which involved the smashing of instruments . Hendrix joked : " Maybe I can smash up an elephant " , to which Altham replied : " Well , it 's a pity you can 't set fire to your guitar " . Chandler then asked road manager Gerry Stickells to procure some lighter fluid . During the show , Hendrix gave an especially dynamic performance before setting his guitar on fire at the end of a 45 @-@ minute set . In the wake of the stunt , members of London 's press labeled Hendrix the " Black Elvis " and the " Wild Man of Borneo " . 
 = = = = Are You Experienced = = = = 
 After the moderate UK chart success of their first two singles , " Hey Joe " and " Purple Haze " , the Experience began assembling material for a full @-@ length LP . Recording began at De Lane Lea Studios and later moved to the prestigious Olympic Studios . The album , Are You Experienced , features a diversity of musical styles , including blues tracks such as " Red House " and " Highway Chile " , and the R & B song " Remember " . It also included the experimental science fiction piece , " Third Stone from the Sun " and the post @-@ modern soundscapes of the title track , with prominent backwards guitar and drums . " I Don 't Live Today " served as a medium for Hendrix 's guitar feedback improvisation and " Fire " was driven by Mitchell 's drumming . 
 Released in the UK on May 12 , 1967 , Are You Experienced spent 33 weeks on the charts , peaking at number two . It was prevented from reaching the top spot by the Beatles ' Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . On June 4 , 1967 , Hendrix opened a show at the Saville Theatre in London with his rendition of Sgt. Pepper 's title track , which was released just three days previous . Beatles manager Brian Epstein owned the Saville at the time , and both George Harrison and Paul McCartney attended the performance . McCartney described the moment : " The curtains flew back and he came walking forward playing ' Sgt. Pepper ' . It 's a pretty major compliment in anyone 's book . I put that down as one of the great honors of my career . " Released in the U.S. on August 23 by Reprise Records , Are You Experienced reached number five on the Billboard 200 . 
 In 1989 , Noe Goldwasser , the founding editor of Guitar World magazine , described Are You Experienced as " the album that shook the world ... leaving it forever changed " . In 2005 , Rolling Stone called the double @-@ platinum LP Hendrix 's " epochal debut " , and they ranked it the 15th greatest album of all time , noting his " exploitation of amp howl " , and characterizing his guitar playing as " incendiary ... historic in itself " . 
 = = = = Monterey Pop Festival = = = = 
 Although popular in Europe at the time , the Experience 's first U.S. single , " Hey Joe " , failed to reach the Billboard Hot 100 chart upon its release on May 1 , 1967 . The group 's fortunes improved when McCartney recommended them to the organizers of the Monterey Pop Festival . He insisted that the event would be incomplete without Hendrix , whom he called " an absolute ace on the guitar " , and he agreed to join the board of organizers on the condition that the Experience perform at the festival in mid @-@ June . 
 Introduced by Brian Jones as " the most exciting performer [ he had ] ever heard " , Hendrix opened with a fast arrangement of Howlin ' Wolf 's song " Killing Floor " , wearing what author Keith Shadwick described as " clothes as exotic as any on display elsewhere . " Shadwick wrote : " [ Hendrix ] was not only something utterly new musically , but an entirely original vision of what a black American entertainer should and could look like . " The Experience went on to perform renditions of " Hey Joe " , B.B. King 's " Rock Me Baby " , Chip Taylor 's " Wild Thing " , and Bob Dylan 's " Like a Rolling Stone " , as well as four original compositions : " Foxy Lady " , " Can You See Me " , " The Wind Cries Mary " , and " Purple Haze " . The set ended with Hendrix destroying his guitar and tossing pieces of it out to the audience . Rolling Stone 's Alex <unk> wrote : 
 When Jimi Hendrix set his guitar on fire at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival he created one of rock 's most perfect moments . Standing in the front row of that concert was a 17 @-@ year @-@ old boy named Ed Caraeff . Caraeff had never seen Hendrix before nor heard his music , but he had a camera with him and there was one shot left in his roll of film . As Hendrix lit his guitar , Caraeff took a final photo . It would become one of the most famous images in rock and roll . 
 Caraeff stood on a chair next to the edge of the stage while taking a series of four monochrome pictures of Hendrix burning his guitar . Caraeff was close enough to the fire that he had to use his camera as a shield to protect his face from the heat . Rolling Stone later colorized the image , matching it with other pictures taken at the festival before using the shot for a 1987 magazine cover . According to author Gail Buckland , the fourth and final frame of " Hendrix kneeling in front of his burning guitar , hands raised , is one of the most famous images in rock . " Author and historian Matthew C. Whitaker wrote : " Hendrix 's burning of his guitar became an iconic image in rock history and brought him national attention . " The Los Angeles Times asserted that , upon leaving the stage , Hendrix " graduated from rumor to legend " . Author John McDermott commented : " Hendrix left the Monterey audience stunned and in disbelief at what they 'd just heard and seen . " According to Hendrix : " I decided to destroy my guitar at the end of a song as a sacrifice . You sacrifice things you love . I love my guitar . " The performance was filmed by D. A. Pennebaker , and later included in the concert documentary Monterey Pop , which helped Hendrix gain popularity with the U.S. public . 
 Immediately after the festival , the Experience were booked for a series of five concerts at Bill Graham 's Fillmore , with Big Brother and the Holding Company and Jefferson Airplane . The Experience outperformed Jefferson Airplane during the first two nights , and replaced them at the top of the bill on the fifth . Following their successful West Coast introduction , which included a free open @-@ air concert at Golden Gate Park and a concert at the Whisky a Go Go , the Experience were booked as the opening act for the first American tour of the Monkees . They requested Hendrix as a supporting act because they were fans , but their young audience disliked the Experience , who left the tour after six shows . Chandler later admitted that he engineered the tour in an effort to gain publicity for Hendrix . 
 = = = = Axis : Bold as Love = = = = 
 The second Experience album , Axis : Bold as Love , opens with the track " EXP " , which innovatively utilized <unk> and harmonic feedback . It also showcased an experimental stereo panning effect in which sounds emanating from Hendrix 's guitar move through the stereo image , revolving around the listener . The piece reflected his growing interest in science fiction and outer space . He composed the album 's title track and finale around two verses and two choruses , during which he pairs emotions with personas , comparing them to colors . The song 's coda features the first recording of stereo phasing . Shadwick described the composition as " possibly the most ambitious piece on Axis , the extravagant metaphors of the lyrics suggesting a growing confidence " in Hendrix 's songwriting . His guitar playing throughout the song is marked by chordal arpeggios and contrapuntal motion , with tremolo @-@ picked partial chords providing the musical foundation for the chorus , which culminates in what musicologist Andy Aledort described as " simply one of the greatest electric guitar solos ever played " . The track fades out on tremolo @-@ picked thirty @-@ second note double stops . 
 The scheduled release date for Axis was almost delayed when Hendrix lost the master tape of side one of the LP , leaving it in the back seat of a London taxi . With the deadline looming , Hendrix , Chandler , and engineer Eddie Kramer remixed most of side one in a single overnight session , but they could not match the quality of the lost mix of " If 6 Was 9 " . Bassist Noel Redding had a tape recording of this mix , which had to be smoothed out with an iron as it had gotten wrinkled . During the verses , Hendrix doubled his singing with a guitar line which he played one octave lower than his vocals . Hendrix voiced his disappointment about having re @-@ mixed the album so quickly , and he felt that it could have been better had they been given more time . 
 Axis featured psychedelic cover art that depicts Hendrix and the Experience as various forms of Vishnu , incorporating a painting of them by Roger Law , from a photo @-@ portrait by Karl Ferris . The painting was then superimposed on a copy of a mass @-@ produced religious poster . Hendrix stated that the cover , which Track spent $ 5 @,@ 000 producing , would have been more appropriate had it highlighted his American Indian heritage . He commented : " You got it wrong ... I 'm not that kind of Indian . " Track released the album in the UK on December 1 , 1967 , where it peaked at number five , spending 16 weeks on the charts . In February 1968 , Axis : Bold as Love reached number three in the U.S. 
 While author and journalist Richie Unterberger described Axis as the least impressive Experience album , according to author Peter Doggett , the release " heralded a new subtlety in Hendrix 's work " . Mitchell commented : " Axis was the first time that it became apparent that Jimi was pretty good working behind the mixing board , as well as playing , and had some positive ideas of how he wanted things recorded . It could have been the start of any potential conflict between him and Chas in the studio . " 
 = = = = Electric Ladyland = = = = 
 Recording for the Experience 's third and final studio album , Electric Ladyland , began at the newly opened Record Plant Studios , with Chandler as producer and engineers Eddie Kramer and Gary Kellgren . As the sessions progressed , Chandler became increasingly frustrated with Hendrix 's perfectionism and his demands for repeated takes . Hendrix also allowed numerous friends and guests to join them in the studio , which contributed to a chaotic and crowded environment in the control room and led Chandler to sever his professional relationship with Hendrix . Redding later recalled : " There were tons of people in the studio ; you couldn 't move . It was a party , not a session . " Redding , who had formed his own band in mid @-@ 1968 , Fat Mattress , found it increasingly difficult to fulfill his commitments with the Experience , so Hendrix played many of the bass parts on Electric Ladyland . The album 's cover stated that it was " produced and directed by Jimi Hendrix " . 
 During the Electric Ladyland recording sessions , Hendrix began experimenting with other combinations of musicians , including Jefferson Airplane 's Jack Casady and Traffic 's Steve Winwood , who played bass and organ , respectively , on the fifteen @-@ minute slow @-@ blues jam , " Voodoo Chile " . During the album 's production , Hendrix appeared at an impromptu jam with B.B. King , Al Kooper , and Elvin Bishop . Electric Ladyland was released on October 25 , and by mid @-@ November it had reached number one in the U.S. , spending two weeks at the top spot . The double LP was Hendrix 's most commercially successful release and his only number one album . It peaked at number six in the UK , spending 12 weeks on the chart . Electric Ladyland included Hendrix 's cover of Bob Dylan 's song , " All Along the Watchtower " , which became Hendrix 's highest @-@ selling single and his only U.S. top 40 hit , peaking at number 20 ; the single reached number five in the UK . " Burning of the Midnight Lamp " , which was his first recorded song to feature the use of a wah @-@ wah pedal , was added to the album . It was originally released as his fourth single in the UK in August 1967 and reached number 18 in the charts . 
 In 1989 , Noe Goldwasser , the founding editor of Guitar World magazine , described Electric Ladyland as " Hendrix 's masterpiece " . According to author Michael Heatley , " most critics agree " that the album is " the fullest realization of Jimi 's far @-@ reaching ambitions . " In 2004 , author Peter Doggett commented : " For pure experimental genius , melodic flair , conceptual vision and instrumental brilliance , Electric Ladyland remains a prime contender for the status of rock 's greatest album . " Doggett described the LP as " a display of musical virtuosity never surpassed by any rock musician . " 
 = = = Break @-@ up of the Experience = = = 
 In January 1969 , after an absence of more than six months , Hendrix briefly moved back into his girlfriend Kathy Etchingham 's Brook Street apartment , which was next door to the Handel House Museum in the West End of London . During this time , the Experience toured Scandinavia , Germany , and gave their final two performances in France . On February 18 and 24 , they played sold @-@ out concerts at London 's Royal Albert Hall , which were the last European appearances of this line @-@ up . 
 By February 1969 , Redding had grown weary of Hendrix 's unpredictable work ethic and his creative control over the Experience 's music . During the previous month 's European tour , interpersonal relations within the group had deteriorated , particularly between Hendrix and Redding . In his diary , Redding documented the building frustration during early 1969 recording sessions : " On the first day , as I nearly expected , there was nothing doing ... On the second it was no show at all . I went to the pub for three hours , came back , and it was still ages before Jimi <unk> in . Then we argued ... On the last day , I just watched it happen for a while , and then went back to my flat . " The last Experience sessions that included Redding — a re @-@ recording of " Stone Free " for use as a possible single release — took place on April 14 at Olmstead and the Record Plant in New York . Hendrix then flew bassist Billy Cox to New York ; they started recording and rehearsing together on April 21 . 
 The last performance of the original Experience line @-@ up took place on June 29 , 1969 , at Barry Fey 's Denver Pop Festival , a three @-@ day event held at Denver 's Mile High Stadium that was marked by police using tear gas to control the audience . The band narrowly escaped from the venue in the back of a rental truck , which was partly crushed by fans who had climbed on top of the vehicle . Before the show , a journalist angered Redding by asking why he was there ; the reporter then informed him that two weeks earlier Hendrix announced that he had been replaced with Billy Cox . The next day , Redding quit the Experience and returned to London . He announced that he had left the band and intended to pursue a solo career , blaming Hendrix 's plans to expand the group without allowing for his input as a primary reason for leaving . Redding later commented : " Mitch and I hung out a lot together , but we 're English . If we 'd go out , Jimi would stay in his room . But any bad feelings came from us being three guys who were traveling too hard , getting too tired , and taking too many drugs ... I liked Hendrix . I don 't like Mitchell . " 
 Soon after Redding 's departure , Hendrix began lodging at the eight @-@ bedroom Ashokan House , in the hamlet of Boiceville near Woodstock in upstate New York , where he had spent some time vacationing in mid @-@ 1969 . Manager Michael Jeffery arranged the accommodations in the hope that the respite might encourage Hendrix to write material for a new album . During this time , Mitchell was unavailable for commitments made by Jeffery , which included Hendrix 's first appearance on U.S. TV — on The Dick Cavett Show — where he was backed by the studio orchestra , and an appearance on The Tonight Show where he appeared with Cox and session drummer Ed Shaughnessy . 
 = = = Woodstock = = = 
 By 1969 , Hendrix was the world 's highest @-@ paid rock musician . In August , he headlined the Woodstock Music and Art Fair that included many of the most popular bands of the time . For the concert , he added rhythm guitarist Larry Lee and conga players Juma Sultan and Jerry Velez . The band rehearsed for less than two weeks before the performance , and according to Mitchell , they never connected musically . Before arriving at the engagement , he heard reports that the size of the audience had grown to epic proportions , which gave him cause for concern as he did not enjoy performing for large crowds . He was an important draw for the event , and although he accepted substantially less money for the appearance than his usual fee he was the festival 's highest @-@ paid performer . As his scheduled time slot of midnight on Sunday drew closer , he indicated that he preferred to wait and close the show in the morning ; the band took the stage around 8 : 00 a.m. on Monday . By the time of their set , Hendrix had been awake for more than three days . The audience , which peaked at an estimated 400 @,@ 000 people , was now reduced to 30 – 40 @,@ 000 , many of whom had waited to catch a glimpse of Hendrix before leaving during his performance . The festival MC , Chip Monck , introduced the group as the Jimi Hendrix Experience , but Hendrix clarified : " We decided to change the whole thing around and call it Gypsy Sun and Rainbows . For short , it 's nothin ' but a Band of Gypsys " . 
 Hendrix 's performance featured a rendition of the U.S. national anthem , " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " , during which he used copious amounts of amplifier feedback , distortion , and sustain to replicate the sounds made by rockets and bombs . Although contemporary political pundits described his interpretation as a statement against the Vietnam War , three weeks later Hendrix explained its meaning : " We 're all Americans ... it was like ' Go America ! ' ... We play it the way the air is in America today . The air is slightly static , see " . <unk> in the 1970 documentary film , Woodstock , his guitar @-@ driven version would become part of the sixties Zeitgeist . Pop critic Al Aronowitz of The New York Post wrote : " It was the most electrifying moment of Woodstock , and it was probably the single greatest moment of the sixties . " Images of the performance showing Hendrix wearing a blue @-@ beaded white leather jacket with fringe , a red head @-@ scarf , and blue jeans are widely regarded as iconic pictures that capture a defining moment of the era . He played " Hey Joe " during the encore , concluding the 3 ½ <unk> festival . Upon leaving the stage , he collapsed from exhaustion . In 2011 , the editors of Guitar World placed his rendition of " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " at Woodstock at number one in their list of his 100 greatest performances . 
 = = = Band of Gypsys = = = 
 A legal dispute arose in 1966 regarding a record contract that Hendrix had entered into the previous year with producer Ed Chalpin . After two years of litigation , the parties agreed to a resolution that granted Chalpin the distribution rights to an album of original Hendrix material . Hendrix decided that they would record the LP , Band of Gypsys , during two live appearances . In preparation for the shows he formed an all @-@ black power @-@ trio with Cox and drummer Buddy Miles , formerly with Wilson Pickett , the Electric Flag , and the Buddy Miles Express . Critic John Rockwell described Hendrix and Miles as jazz @-@ rock fusionists , and their collaboration as pioneering . Others identified a funk and soul influence in their music . Concert promoter Bill Graham called the shows " the most brilliant , emotional display of virtuoso electric guitar " that he had ever heard . Biographers have speculated that Hendrix formed the band in an effort to appease members of the Black Power movement and others in the black communities who called for him to use his fame to speak @-@ up for civil rights . 
 Hendrix had been recording with Cox since April and jamming with Miles since September , and the trio wrote and rehearsed material which they performed at a series of four shows over two nights on December 31 and January 1 , at the Fillmore East . They used recordings of these concerts to assemble the LP , which was produced by Hendrix . The album includes the track " Machine Gun " , which musicologist Andy Aledort described as the pinnacle of Hendrix 's career , and " the premiere example of [ his ] unparalleled genius as a rock guitarist ... In this performance , Jimi transcended the medium of rock music , and set an entirely new standard for the potential of electric guitar . " During the song 's extended instrumental breaks , Hendrix created sounds with his guitar that sonically represented warfare , including rockets , bombs , and diving planes . 
 The Band of Gypsys album was the only official live Hendrix LP made commercially available during his lifetime ; several tracks from the Woodstock and Monterey shows were released later that year . The album was released in April 1970 by Capitol Records ; it reached the top ten in both the U.S. and the UK . That same month a single was issued with " Stepping Stone " as the A @-@ side and " Izabella " as the B @-@ side , but Hendrix was dissatisfied with the quality of the mastering and he demanded that it be withdrawn and re @-@ mixed , preventing the songs from charting and resulting in Hendrix 's least successful single ; it was also his last . 
 On January 28 , 1970 , a third and final Band of Gypsys appearance took place ; they performed during a music festival at Madison Square Garden benefiting the anti @-@ Vietnam War Moratorium Committee titled the " Winter Festival for Peace " . American blues guitarist Johnny Winter was backstage before the concert ; he recalled : " [ Hendrix ] came in with his head down , sat on the couch alone , and put his head in his hands ... He didn 't move until it was time for the show . " Minutes after taking the stage he snapped a vulgar response at a woman who had shouted a request for " Foxy Lady " . He then began playing " Earth Blues " before telling the audience : " That 's what happens when earth fucks with space " . Moments later , he briefly sat down on the drum riser before leaving the stage . Both Miles and Redding later stated that Jeffery had given Hendrix LSD before the performance . Miles believed that Jeffery gave Hendrix the drugs in an effort to sabotage the current band and bring about the return of the original Experience lineup . Jeffery fired Miles after the show and Cox quit , ending the Band of Gypsys . 
 = = = Cry of Love Tour = = = 
 Soon after the abruptly ended Band of Gypsys performance and their subsequent dissolution , Jeffery made arrangements to reunite the original Experience line @-@ up . Although Hendrix , Mitchell , and Redding were interviewed by Rolling Stone in February 1970 as a united group , Hendrix never intended to work with Redding . When Redding returned to New York in anticipation of rehearsals with a reformed Experience , he was told that he had been replaced with Cox . During an interview with Rolling Stone 's Keith Altham , Hendrix defended the decision : " It 's nothing personal against Noel , but we finished what we were doing with the Experience and Billy 's style of playing suits the new group better . " Although the lineup of Hendrix , Mitchell , and Cox became known as the Cry of Love band , after their accompanying tour , billing , advertisements , and tickets were printed with the New Jimi Hendrix Experience or occasionally just Jimi Hendrix . 
 During the first half of 1970 , Hendrix sporadically worked on material for what would have been his next LP . Many of the tracks were posthumously released in 1971 as The Cry of Love . He had started writing songs for the album in 1968 , but in April 1970 he told Keith Altham that the project had been abandoned . Soon afterward , he and his band took a break from recording and began the Cry of Love tour at the L.A. Forum , performing for 20 @,@ 000 people . Set @-@ lists during the tour included numerous Experience tracks as well as a selection of newer material . Several shows were recorded , and they produced some of Hendrix 's most memorable live performances . At one of them , the second Atlanta International Pop Festival , on July 4 , he played to the largest American audience of his career . According to authors Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz , as many as 500 @,@ 000 people attended the concert . On July 17 , they appeared at the New York Pop Festival ; Hendrix had again consumed too many drugs before the show , and the set was considered a disaster . The American leg of the tour , which included 32 performances , ended at Honolulu , Hawaii , on August 1 , 1970 . This would be Hendrix 's final concert appearance in the U.S. 
 = = = Electric Lady Studios = = = 
 In 1968 , Hendrix and Jeffery jointly invested in the purchase of the Generation Club in Greenwich Village . They had initially planned to reopen the establishment , but after an audit revealed that Hendrix had incurred exorbitant fees by block @-@ booking lengthy sessions at peak rates they decided that the building would better serve them as a recording studio . With a facility of his own , Hendrix could work as much as he wanted while also reducing his recording expenditures , which had reached a reported $ 300 @,@ 000 annually . Architect and <unk> John <unk> designed Electric Lady Studios for Hendrix , who requested that they avoid right angles where possible . With round windows , an ambient lighting machine , and a psychedelic mural , <unk> wanted the studio to have a relaxing environment that would encourage Hendrix 's creativity . The project took twice as long as planned and cost twice as much as Hendrix and Jeffery had budgeted , with their total investment estimated at $ 1 million . 
 Hendrix first used Electric Lady on June 15 , 1970 , when he jammed with Steve Winwood and Chris Wood of Traffic ; the next day , he recorded his first track there , " Night Bird Flying " . The studio officially opened for business on August 25 , and a grand opening party was held the following day . Immediately afterwards , Hendrix left for England ; he never returned to the States . He boarded an Air India flight for London with Cox , joining Mitchell for a performance as the headlining act of the Isle of Wight Festival . 
 = = = European tour = = = 
 When the European leg of the Cry of Love tour began , Hendrix was longing for his new studio and creative outlet , and was not eager to fulfill the commitment . On September 2 , 1970 , he abandoned a performance in Aarhus after three songs , stating : " I 've been dead a long time " . Four days later , he gave his final concert appearance , at the Isle of Fehmarn Festival in Germany . He was met with booing and jeering from fans in response to his cancellation of a show slated for the end of the previous night 's bill due to torrential rain and risk of electrocution . Immediately following the festival , Hendrix , Mitchell , and Cox travelled to London . 
 Three days after the performance , Cox , who was suffering from severe paranoia after either taking LSD or being given it unknowingly , quit the tour and went to stay with his parents in Pennsylvania . Within days of Hendrix 's arrival in England , he had spoken with Chas Chandler , Alan Douglas , and others about leaving his manager , Michael Jeffery . On September 16 , Hendrix performed in public for the last time during an informal jam at Ronnie Scott 's Jazz Club in Soho with Eric Burdon and his latest band , War . They began by playing a few of their recent hits , and after a brief intermission Hendrix joined them during " Mother Earth " and " Tobacco Road " . His performance was uncharacteristically subdued ; he quietly played backing guitar , and refrained from the histrionics that people had come to expect from him . He died less than 48 hours later . 
 = = Drugs and alcohol = = 
 In July 1962 , after Hendrix was discharged from the U.S. Army , he entered a small club in Clarksville , Tennessee . Drawn in by live music , he stopped for a drink and ended up spending most of the $ 400 he had saved . He explained : " I went in this jazz joint and had a drink . I liked it and I stayed . People tell me I get foolish , good @-@ natured sometimes . Anyway , I guess I felt real benevolent that day . I must have been handing out bills to anyone that asked me . I came out of that place with sixteen dollars left . " According to the authors Steven Roby and Brad Schreiber : " Alcohol would later be the scourge of his existence , driving him to fits of pique , even rare bursts of atypical , physical violence . " 
 While Roby and Schreiber assert that Hendrix first used LSD when he met Linda Keith in late 1966 , according to the authors Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek , the earliest that Hendrix is known to have taken it was in June 1967 , while attending the Monterey Pop Festival . According to Hendrix biographer Charles Cross , the subject of drugs came up one evening in 1966 at Keith 's New York apartment ; when one of Keith 's friends offered Hendrix acid , a street name for lysergic acid diethylamide , Hendrix asked for LSD instead , showing what Cross described as " his naivete and his complete inexperience with psychedelics " . Before that , Hendrix had only sporadically used drugs , his experimentation was significantly limited to cannabis , hashish , amphetamines and occasionally cocaine . After 1967 , he regularly smoked cannabis and hashish and used LSD and amphetamines , particularly while touring . According to Cross , by the time of his death in September 1970 , " few stars were as closely associated with the drug culture as Jimi " . 
 = = = Substance abuse and violence = = = 
 Hendrix would often become angry and violent when he drank too much alcohol or when he mixed alcohol with drugs . His friend Herbie Worthington explained : " You wouldn 't expect somebody with that kind of love to be that violent ... He just couldn 't drink ... he simply turned into a bastard " . According to journalist and friend Sharon Lawrence , Hendrix " admitted he could not handle hard liquor , which set off a bottled @-@ up anger , a destructive fury he almost never displayed otherwise " . 
 In January 1968 , the Experience travelled to Sweden for a one @-@ week tour of Europe . During the early morning hours of the first day , Hendrix became engaged in a drunken brawl in the Hotel <unk> , in Gothenburg , smashing a plate @-@ glass window and injuring his right hand , for which he received medical treatment . The incident culminated in his arrest and release , pending a court appearance that resulted in a large fine . After the 1969 burglary of a house Hendrix was renting in Benedict Canyon , California and while he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol , he punched his friend Paul Caruso and accused him of the theft . He then chased Caruso away from the residence while throwing stones at him . A few days later , one of Hendrix 's girlfriends , Carmen <unk> , required stitches after he hit her above her eye with a vodka bottle during a drunken , jealous rage .

 On May 3 , 1969 , while Hendrix was passing through customs at Toronto International Airport , authorities detained him after finding a small amount of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage . Four hours later , he was formally charged with drug possession and released on $ 10 @,@ 000 bail . He was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing . The incident proved stressful for Hendrix , and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial . For the Crown to prove possession they had to show that Hendrix knew the drugs were there . During the jury trial , which took place in December , he testified that a fan had given him a vial of what he thought was legal medication , which he put in his bag not knowing what was in it . He was acquitted of the charges . Mitchell and Redding later revealed that everyone had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto ; both men also stated that they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix 's bag . 
 = = Death , post @-@ mortem , and burial = = 
 Although the details of Hendrix 's last day and death are widely disputed , he spent much of September 17 , 1970 , in London with Monika Dannemann , the only witness to his final hours . Dannemann said that she prepared a meal for them at her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel , 22 Lansdowne Crescent , Notting Hill , sometime around 11 p.m. , when they shared a bottle of wine . She drove Hendrix to the residence of an acquaintance at approximately 1 : 45 a.m. , where he remained for about an hour before she picked him up and drove them back to her flat at 3 a.m. Dannemann said they talked until around 7 a.m. , when they went to sleep . She awoke around 11 a.m. , and found Hendrix breathing , but unconscious and unresponsive . She called for an ambulance at 11 : 18 a.m. ; they arrived on the scene at 11 : 27 a.m. Paramedics then transported Hendrix to St Mary Abbot 's Hospital where Dr. John Bannister pronounced him dead at 12 : 45 p.m. on September 18 , 1970 . 
 To determine the cause of death , coroner Gavin Thurston ordered a post @-@ mortem examination on Hendrix 's body , which was performed on September 21 by Professor Robert Donald Teare , a forensic pathologist . Thurston completed the inquest on September 28 , and concluded that Hendrix aspirated his own vomit and died of asphyxia while intoxicated with barbiturates . Citing " insufficient evidence of the circumstances " , he declared an open verdict . Dannemann later revealed that Hendrix had taken nine of her prescribed Vesparax sleeping tablets , 18 times the recommended dosage . 
 After Hendrix 's body had been embalmed by Desmond Henley , it was flown to Seattle , Washington , on September 29 , 1970 . After a service at Dunlop Baptist Church on October 1 , it was interred at Greenwood Cemetery in Renton , Washington , the location of his mother 's gravesite . Hendrix 's family and friends traveled in twenty @-@ four limousines and more than two hundred people attended the funeral , including several notable musicians such as original Experience members Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding , as well as Miles Davis , John Hammond , and Johnny Winter . 
 = = Unauthorized and posthumous releases = = 
 By 1967 , as Hendrix was gaining in popularity , many of his pre @-@ Experience recordings were marketed to an unsuspecting public as Jimi Hendrix albums , sometimes with misleading later images of Hendrix . The recordings , which came under the control of producer Ed Chalpin of PPX , with whom Hendrix had signed a recording contract in 1965 , were often re @-@ mixed between their repeated reissues , and licensed to record companies such as Decca and Capitol . Hendrix publicly denounced the releases , describing them as " malicious " and " greatly inferior " , stating : " At PPX , we spent on average about one hour recording a song . Today I spend at least twelve hours on each song . " These unauthorized releases have long constituted a substantial part of his recording catalogue , amounting to hundreds of albums . 
 Some of Hendrix 's unfinished material was released as the 1971 title The Cry of Love . Although the album reached number three in the U.S. and number two in the UK , producers Mitchell and Kramer later complained that they were unable to make use of all the available songs because some tracks were used for 1971 's Rainbow Bridge ; still others were issued on 1972 's War Heroes . Material from The Cry of Love was re @-@ released in 1997 as First Rays of the New Rising Sun , along with the other tracks that Mitchell and Kramer had wanted to include . 
 In 1993 , MCA Records delayed a multimillion @-@ dollar sale of Hendrix 's publishing copyrights because Al Hendrix was unhappy about the arrangement . He acknowledged that he had sold distribution rights to a foreign corporation in 1974 , but stated that it did not include copyrights and argued that he had retained veto power of the sale of the catalogue . Under a settlement reached in July 1995 , Al Hendrix prevailed in his legal battle and regained control of his son 's song and image rights . He subsequently licensed the recordings to MCA through the family @-@ run company Experience Hendrix LLC , formed in 1995 . In August 2009 , Experience Hendrix announced that it had entered a new licensing agreement with Sony Music Entertainment 's Legacy Recordings division which would take effect in 2010 . Legacy and Experience Hendrix launched the 2010 Jimi Hendrix Catalog Project , starting with the release of Valleys of Neptune in March of that year . In the months before his death , Hendrix recorded demos for a concept album tentatively titled Black Gold , which are now in the possession of Experience Hendrix LLC ; as of 2013 no official release date has been announced . 
 = = Equipment = = 
 = = = Guitars and amplifiers = = = 
 Hendrix played a variety of guitars throughout his career , but the instrument that became most associated with him was the Fender Stratocaster . He acquired his first Stratocaster in 1966 , when a girlfriend loaned him enough money to purchase a used one that had been built around 1964 . He thereafter used the model prevalently during performances and recordings . In 1967 , he described the instrument as " the best all @-@ around guitar for the stuff we 're doing " ; he praised its " bright treble and deep bass sounds " . 
 With few exceptions , Hendrix played right @-@ handed guitars that were turned upside down and <unk> for left @-@ hand playing . This had an important effect on the sound of his guitar ; because of the slant of the bridge pickup , his lowest string had a brighter sound while his highest string had a darker sound , which was the opposite of the Stratocaster 's intended design . In addition to <unk> , Hendrix also used Fender Jazzmasters , <unk> , two different Gibson Flying Vs , a Gibson Les Paul , three Gibson <unk> , a Gretsch Corvette , and a Fender Jaguar . He used a white Gibson SG Custom for his performances on The Dick Cavett Show in September 1969 , and a black Gibson Flying V during the Isle of Wight festival in 1970 . 
 During 1965 and 1966 , while Hendrix was playing back @-@ up for soul and R & B acts in the U.S. , he used an 85 @-@ watt Fender Twin Reverb amplifier . When Chandler brought Hendrix to England in October 1966 , he supplied him with 30 @-@ watt Burns amps , which Hendrix thought were too small for his needs . After an early London gig when he was unable to use his preferred Fender Twin , he asked about the Marshall amps that he had noticed other groups using . Years earlier , Mitch Mitchell had taken drum lessons from the amp builder , Jim Marshall , and he introduced Hendrix to Marshall . At their initial meeting , Hendrix bought four speaker cabinets and three 100 @-@ watt Super Lead amplifiers ; he would grow accustomed to using all three in unison . The equipment arrived on October 11 , 1966 , and the Experience used the new gear during their first tour . Marshall amps were well @-@ suited for Hendrix 's needs , and they were paramount in the evolution of his heavily overdriven sound , enabling him to master the use of feedback as a musical effect , creating what author Paul Trynka described as a " definitive vocabulary for rock guitar " . Hendrix usually turned all of the amplifier 's control knobs to the maximum level , which became known as the Hendrix setting . During the four years prior to his death , he purchased between 50 and 100 Marshall amplifiers . Jim Marshall said that he was " the greatest ambassador " his company ever had . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 One of Hendrix 's signature effects was the wah @-@ wah pedal , which he first heard used with an electric guitar in Cream 's " Tales of Brave Ulysses " , released in May 1967 . In July of that year , while playing gigs at the Scene club in New York City , Hendrix met Frank Zappa , whose band , the Mothers of Invention were performing at the adjacent Garrick Theater . Hendrix was fascinated by Zappa 's application of the pedal , and he experimented with one later that evening . He used a wah pedal during the opening to " Voodoo Child ( Slight Return ) " , creating one of the best @-@ known wah @-@ wah riffs of the classic rock era . He can also be heard using the effect on " Up from the Skies " , " Little Miss Lover " , and " Still Raining , Still Dreaming " . 
 Hendrix consistently used a Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face and a Vox wah pedal during recording sessions and live performances , but he also experimented with other guitar effects . He enjoyed a fruitful long @-@ term collaboration with electronics enthusiast Roger Mayer , whom he once called " the secret " of his sound . Mayer introduced him to the Octavia , an octave doubling effect pedal , in December 1966 , and he first recorded with the effect during the guitar solo to " Purple Haze " . 
 Hendrix also utilized the Uni @-@ Vibe , which was designed to simulate the modulation effects of a rotating Leslie speaker by providing a rich phasing sound that could be manipulated with a speed control pedal . He can be heard using the effect during his performance at Woodstock and on the Band of Gypsys track " Machine Gun " , which prominently features the Uni @-@ vibe along with an Octavia and a Fuzz Face . His signal flow for live performance involved first plugging his guitar into a wah @-@ wah pedal , then connecting the wah @-@ wah pedal to a Fuzz Face , which was then linked to a Uni @-@ Vibe , before connecting to a Marshall amplifier . 
 = = Influences = = 
 As an adolescent during the 1950s , Hendrix became interested in rock and roll artists such as Elvis Presley , Little Richard , and Chuck Berry . In 1968 , he told Guitar Player magazine that electric blues artists Muddy Waters , Elmore James , and B.B. King inspired him during the beginning of his career ; he also cited Eddie Cochran as an early influence . Of Muddy Waters , the first electric guitarist of which Hendrix became aware , he said : " I heard one of his records when I was a little boy and it scared me to death because I heard all of these sounds . " In 1970 , he told Rolling Stone that he was a fan of western swing artist Bob Wills and while he lived in Nashville , the television show the Grand Ole Opry . 
 Cox stated that during their time serving in the U.S. military he and Hendrix primarily listened to southern blues artists such as Jimmy Reed and Albert King . According to Cox , " King was a very , very powerful influence " . Howlin ' Wolf also inspired Hendrix , who performed Wolf 's " Killing Floor " as the opening song of his U.S. debut at the Monterey Pop Festival . The influence of soul artist Curtis Mayfield can be heard in Hendrix 's guitar playing , and the influence of Bob Dylan can be heard in Hendrix 's songwriting ; he was known to play Dylan 's records repeatedly , particularly Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde .

 The Experience 's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame biography states : " Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music . Hendrix expanded the range and vocabulary of the electric guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured before . His boundless drive , technical ability and creative application of such effects as wah @-@ wah and distortion forever transformed the sound of rock and roll . " Musicologist Andy Aledort described Hendrix as " one of the most creative " and " influential musicians that has ever lived " . Music journalist Chuck Philips wrote : " In a field almost exclusively populated by white musicians , Hendrix has served as a role model for a cadre of young black rockers . His achievement was to reclaim title to a musical form pioneered by black innovators like Little Richard and Chuck Berry in the 1950s . " 
 Hendrix favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain . He was instrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback , and helped to popularize use of the wah @-@ wah pedal in mainstream rock . He rejected the standard barre chord fretting technique used by most guitarists in favor of fretting the low 6th string root notes with his thumb . He applied this technique during the beginning bars of " Little Wing " , which allowed him to sustain the root note of chords while also playing melody . This method has been described as piano style , with the thumb playing what a pianist 's left hand would play and the other fingers playing melody as a right hand . Having spent several years fronting a trio , he developed an ability to play rhythm chords and lead lines together , giving the audio impression that more than one guitarist was performing . He was the first artist to incorporate stereophonic phasing effects in rock music recordings . Holly George @-@ Warren of Rolling Stone commented : " Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source . Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion , but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled , fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began . " Aledort wrote : " In rock guitar , there are but two eras — before Hendrix and after Hendrix . " 
 While creating his unique musical voice and guitar style , Hendrix synthesized diverse genres , including blues , R & B , soul , British rock , American folk music , 1950s rock and roll , and jazz . Musicologist David Moskowitz emphasized the importance of blues music in Hendrix 's playing style , and according to authors Steven Roby and Brad Schreiber , " [ He ] explored the outer reaches of psychedelic rock " . His influence is evident in a variety of popular music formats , and he has contributed significantly to the development of hard rock , heavy metal , funk , post @-@ punk , and hip hop music . His lasting influence on modern guitar players is difficult to overstate ; his techniques and delivery have been abundantly imitated by others . Despite his hectic touring schedule and notorious perfectionism , he was a prolific recording artist who left behind numerous unreleased recordings . More than 40 years after his death , Hendrix remains as popular as ever , with annual album sales exceeding that of any year during his lifetime . 
 Hendrix has influenced numerous funk and funk rock artists , including Prince , George Clinton , John Frusciante , formerly of the Red Hot Chili Peppers , Eddie Hazel of Funkadelic , and Ernie Isley of the Isley Brothers . Hendrix 's influence also extends to many hip hop artists , including De La Soul , A Tribe Called Quest , Digital Underground , Beastie Boys , and Run – D.M.C. Miles Davis was deeply impressed by Hendrix , and he compared Hendrix 's improvisational abilities with those of saxophonist John Coltrane . Hendrix also influenced industrial artist Marilyn Manson , blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan , Metallica 's Kirk Hammett , instrumental rock guitarist Joe Satriani , and heavy metal virtuoso Yngwie Malmsteen , who said : " [ Hendrix ] created modern electric playing , without question ... He was the first . He started it all . The rest is history . "

 Hendrix received several prestigious rock music awards during his lifetime and posthumously . In 1967 , readers of Melody Maker voted him the Pop Musician of the Year . In 1968 , Rolling Stone declared him the Performer of the Year . Also in 1968 , the City of Seattle gave him the Keys to the City . Disc & Music Echo newspaper honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970 , Guitar Player magazine named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year . 
 Rolling Stone ranked his three non @-@ posthumous studio albums , Are You Experienced ( 1967 ) , Axis : Bold as Love ( 1967 ) , and Electric Ladyland ( 1968 ) among the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time . They ranked Hendrix number one on their list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time , and number six on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time . Guitar World 's readers voted six of Hendrix 's solos among the top 100 Greatest Guitar Solos of All Time : " Purple Haze " ( 70 ) , " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " ( 52 ; from Live at Woodstock ) , " Machine Gun " ( 32 ; from Band of Gypsys ) , " Little Wing " ( 18 ) , " Voodoo Child ( Slight Return ) " ( 11 ) , and " All Along the Watchtower " ( 5 ) .

 A star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was dedicated to Hendrix on November 14 , 1991 , at <unk> Hollywood Boulevard . The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 , and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 . In 1999 , readers of Rolling Stone and Guitar World ranked Hendrix among the most important musicians of the 20th century . In 2005 , his debut album , Are You Experienced , was one of 50 recordings added that year to the United States National Recording Registry in the Library of Congress , " [ to ] be preserved for all time ... [ as ] part of the nation 's audio legacy " . 
 The blue plaque identifying his former residence at 23 Brook Street , London ( next door to the former residence of George Frideric Handel ) was the first one issued by English Heritage to commemorate a pop star . A memorial statue of Hendrix playing a Stratocaster stands near the corner of Broadway and Pine Streets in Seattle . In May 2006 , the city renamed a park near its Central District , Jimi Hendrix Park , in his honor . In 2012 , an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron , Georgia . The marker text reads , in part : “ Over thirty musical acts performed , including rock icon Jimi Hendrix playing to the largest American audience of his career . ” 
 Hendrix 's music has received a number of Hall of Fame Grammy awards , starting with a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1992 , followed by two Grammys in 1999 for his albums Are You Experienced and Electric Ladyland ; Axis : Bold as Love received a Grammy in 2006 . In 2000 , he received a Hall of Fame Grammy award for his original composition , " Purple Haze " , and in 2001 for his recording of Dylan 's " All Along the Watchtower " .

 = Robert Deniston Hume = 
 Robert Deniston Hume ( October 31 , 1845 – November 25 , 1908 ) was a cannery owner , pioneer hatchery operator , politician , author , and self @-@ described " pygmy monopolist " who controlled salmon fishing for 32 years on the lower Rogue River in U.S. state of Oregon . Born in Augusta , Maine , and reared by foster parents on a farm , Hume moved at age 18 to San Francisco to join a salmon @-@ canning business started by two of his brothers . They later re @-@ located to Astoria on the Columbia River , where they prospered . After the death of his first wife and their two young children , Hume moved again and started anew in Gold Beach , at the mouth of the Rogue . 
 In 1877 Hume bought rights to a Rogue River fishery , then built a salmon cannery and many other structures and acquired all of the tidelands bordering the lower 12 miles ( 19 km ) of the river . He remarried , invested in a small fleet of ships and a salmon hatchery and expanded his business interests to include a store , hotel , newspaper , and many other enterprises in Gold Beach and in the nearby community of Wedderburn , which he founded . Canning , shipping , and selling hundreds of tons of salmon over the years , he became known as the Salmon King of Oregon . 
 Hume often wrote editorials , engaged in litigation , appealed to legislators , and waged political campaigns to protect his business interests . Running as a Republican , he was twice elected , in 1900 and 1902 , to represent Coos and Curry counties in the Oregon House of Representatives . According to his biographer , he voted self @-@ interest first and conservative positions second , resisting Populist ideas in vogue at the time . 
 Among his publications were a series of articles about fish management , collected and reprinted as Salmon of the Pacific Coast in 1893 . Despite his efforts to maintain a steady fish supply through egg @-@ collecting and fish @-@ rearing , salmon catches on the Rogue , rising in some years and falling in others , generally declined over time . Seventeen years after Hume 's death in 1908 , the state closed the river to commercial fishing . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Robert Hume , the youngest surviving boy in a family of 12 children , was born in Augusta , Maine , on October 31 , 1845 . Because his parents , William and Elizabeth Hume , had little money , he was adopted by the Robert <unk> when he was four years old . After growing up on the Deniston farm , he went to San Francisco at the age of 18 to work in a cannery operated by two of his brothers . In 1867 , when Hume was 22 , he and his brothers , who had moved north to Oregon , opened the first cannery on the Columbia River near Astoria . In 1869 he married Celia Bryant , with whom he had two children . The first , a girl , died while still a baby . The second , a boy , died at age 4 in 1875 , and Celia Hume died shortly thereafter . Celia and the two children were buried in Lone Fir Cemetery in Portland . 
 Although Hume had prospered , buying several Columbia River canneries between 1872 and 1876 , when his wife and children died , he sold most of his holdings and returned to San Francisco . There he bought a steamer , the Alexander Duncan , and searching for new purpose in life , traveled north along the Oregon coast . While visiting Ellensburg ( later renamed Gold Beach ) , he decided to buy a salmon fishery near the mouth of the Rogue River in Curry County . There in late 1876 , " he took up his career once again in one of the most isolated and desolate sections of the Pacific Coast " . 
 = = Lower Rogue empire = = 
 After building a cannery , warehouse , bunkhouse , mess hall , and other buildings and hiring fishermen , Hume opened his salmon business in 1877 . He acquired ownership of all the tidelands along both sides of the lowermost 12 miles ( 19 km ) of the river ; this gave him virtual control of fish populations migrating between the ocean and spawning beds upstream . Over the next 32 years , Hume 's company caught , processed , and shipped hundreds of tons of salmon from the Rogue . Meanwhile , he remarried and expanded his business interests to include a store , hatchery , hotel , saloon , and sawmill , and other enterprises involving shipping , a newspaper ( the Gold Beach Gazette ) , real estate , and ranching . 
 After a fire destroyed the hatchery and several other Hume buildings in 1893 , he moved many of his holdings to the opposite side of the river , where he founded the city of Wedderburn in 1895 , naming it " in honor of the ancestral castle of the Humes of Scotland " . Floating some of his unburned buildings to Wedderburn from Ellensburg , he added a new hatchery , offices , a new home , many other buildings , and a horse @-@ racing track . He started another newspaper , the Wedderburn Radium , and applied successfully for a post office , which opened in 1898 and was run by a Hume employee in Hume 's general store . 
 As his businesses grew , he added to his fleet of ships , big ones to ship salmon to San Francisco and smaller ones for shallow waters and for towing larger ships in and out of the Rogue mouth . In 1879 he bought the steamer Varuna and the tug Mary Hume and started a shipyard at Ellensburg . In 1880 he added the steam schooner Mary D. Hume , the tug Pelican in 1883 , the schooner Berwick in 1887 , the steamer Thistle in 1888 , and replacement craft in subsequent years . Returning ships brought goods for Hume 's general store . 
 Throughout his career , the store was one of the central components of his business . It was a center of supplies and news for the people of the Rogue , who awaited the arrival of the fall provision ship with anticipation and anxiety , for this vessel was the only source of winter provisions . It provided Hume , the employer of the great majority of the citizens of Gold Beach and Wedderburn , with a means of repossessing the wages of his employees and of profiting on the exchange . 
 Hume became known as the Salmon King of Oregon and referred to himself as a " pygmy monopolist " in an autobiography published in the Radium between 1904 and 1906 . 
 = = Politician = = 
 According to Hume 's biographer , Gordon B. Dodds , Hume " entered politics both as officeholder and as lobbyist to protect his realm from the assaults of anti @-@ <unk> " . Between 1890 and 1910 in Oregon , Populist – Progressive coalitions led by W.S. U <unk> and Governor Sylvester Pennoyer , a Democrat , battled business @-@ oriented Republican factions based in Portland . In 1892 , John H. Upton , the Populist candidate for the state legislature from Coos and Curry counties campaigned mainly in opposition to Hume 's monopoly on the Rogue . Political threats like the one posed by Upton as well as threats from the Alaska Packers ' Association ( APA ) , which had begun fishing the Rogue , led Hume to write political editorials , file lawsuits , endorse candidates , petition the legislature , and eventually to run for office himself . 
 In 1894 , Hume , hoping for a seat in the state legislature , campaigned in support of Populist demands such as unlimited coinage of silver , more regulation of large corporations ( like the APA ) , and large @-@ scale government spending for internal improvements . Dodds says that this approach " illustrates Hume 's view of the purpose of a political campaign : The program advocated should be one that would win , and not necessarily the program that the party or the candidate believed in . " After losing this election , Hume went to Salem , the state capital , in 1895 to lobby for bills that might favor his business interests . In 1896 Hume , switching to the Republican Party , used his newspaper , the Wedderburn Gazette , to support Republican William McKinley for the U.S. presidency . 
 In 1900 Hume , running as a Republican , narrowly won election to represent Coos and Curry counties in the state legislature . Shortly after taking office , Hume helped scuttle a bill to repeal a law passed in 1899 that gave the owner of tidelands the exclusive right to fish the waters in front of them . Since Hume owned all the tidelands on the Rogue , the law gave him a monopoly on fishing its lower reaches . On issues unrelated to his business interests , Hume generally voted conservative . He won re @-@ election in 1902 , garnering 934 votes — less than half of the total cast — to the Democrat 's 807 , the Socialist 's 219 , and the Prohibition Party 's 142 . During his second term , Hume fought to keep the tidelands law intact and continued to support laissez @-@ faire government and low taxes . Hume attempted but failed to win nomination for a seat in the state Senate in 1904 , a seat in the state House of Representatives in 1906 , and a seat in the state Senate in 1908 . Dodds sums up Hume 's political career by saying : 
 His accomplishments as a legislator were slight ; only one of his bills ever passed . On the other hand , he spoke and voted against many measures that were defeated and his credo of legislative decision was , first , his own interests and , second , support of a conservative position . In the midst of the Progressive era he remained a " stalwart among the stalwarts " , although during the Populist regime he had expediently yielded for a time to free silver . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Although Hume had shown no early interest in salmon conservation on the Columbia and elsewhere , on the Rogue he tried to protect the fish supply . Disappointed with his company 's catch in 1877 , he built a hatchery in Ellensburg , and in all but 7 of his 32 years on the river he operated hatcheries along the Rogue . 
 Through his newspapers , lawsuits , lobbying , and speeches made while a member of the Oregon Legislature , Hume tried to influence public opinion about artificial fish propagation . In 1893 , he published a series of articles , later reprinted as Salmon of the Pacific Coast , that summarized his ideas about ichthyology . In 1897 , Hume persuaded the United States Fish Commission to run an egg @-@ collecting station at Elk Creek 150 miles ( 240 km ) from the mouth of the Rogue . Hume built the station , and the government paid the salaries of the workers who collected the eggs and shipped them to Hume 's hatchery in Wedderburn . Although his observations on salmon were well received in some quarters , they " often conflicted with the opinions of other pioneers in the field " , and his attempts to control upriver fishing and dams met with resistance and with arguments that he was overfishing the river at its mouth . 
 Despite Hume 's attempts to preserve the fishery , fish runs , oscillating from year to year for a variety of reasons , trended downward over time . The total reported Rogue River salmon catch in 1877 , Hume 's first year on the Rogue , was 531 @,@ 000 pounds ( 241 @,@ 000 kg ) ; the peak catch was 1 @,@ 632 @,@ 000 pounds ( 740 @,@ 000 kg ) in 1890 , and the catch in 1908 , the year of Hume 's death , was 476 @,@ 000 pounds ( 216 @,@ 000 kg ) . As fish runs continued to diminish , the state legislature closed the river to commercial fishing in 1935 .

 In December 1877 , the year after his move to Ellensburg , Hume married Mary Duncan , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old daughter of a former New Zealander , George Duncan , who had lost his fortune in the stock market and hoped to make another by canning salmon in the U.S. According to Dodds , Mary led a relatively secluded life , working in her flower garden , writing letters , and talking to friends , and occasionally selecting clothing for Hume 's store or acting as his secretary when he was sick . Although business occupied Hume most of the time , he seemed to value his wife 's help , Dodds says , and " events indicated their mutual affection " . 
 In October 1908 Hume was traveling on the schooner Osprey , which was towing another ship , Enterprise , when a storm arose . The Enterprise was wrecked , but Osprey rescued its crew and arrived safely in Wedderburn . Hume , who had been exposed to wet and cold , grew ill , rallied briefly , then died on November 17 . According to Dodds , " His dying wish was that he be buried at Hunt Rock overlooking his empire on the Rogue . " In 1912 , after she had sold the Hume holdings in Curry County , Mary Hume had Hume 's body moved to San Francisco . 
 Opinions vary about Hume 's fish theories and practices , which influenced state and federal salmon management for many decades after his death . " Hume was ahead of his time " , Dodds says , " in his belief in hatcheries , in his practice of retaining fry [ immature fish ] in feeding ponds , and in his belief in the home @-@ stream theory of <unk> . " Another writer says that " Robert Hume 's efforts to restock the Rogue with hatchery fish were an early glimmer in the dawning of a new era on the river and in the nation at large " even though " his motives may have been suspect , and the practice a less @-@ than @-@ perfect solution " . An environmental historian says that while many Oregonians regarded Hume as a salmon expert , " his reputation often exceeded his results " . A late 20th @-@ century fisheries scientist sees Hume as " a keen observer of the salmon 's natural history , although he did not always interpret his observations correctly . "

 In his early years , Nelly frequently moved locations within the US , before residing in the city of St. Louis . It was there where he discovered rap artists synonymous within the city ; in his teenage years , Nelly moved to University City , where he shifted his aspirations from becoming a baseball player to producing stories and rhymes . Along with some high school friends — Ali Jones , <unk> Harper , <unk> and Lavell Webb — Nelly formed the group St. Lunatics in 1993 . Frustrated by the lack of attention from record companies , the group formed the consensus to allow Nelly to pursue a solo career , with the rest possibly releasing their own solo albums . Nelly produced demos , which were sent to national labels , eventually gaining attention from Universal Records who signed a record deal with Nelly and the St. Lunatics in 1999 , with Universal releasing the former 's debut album , Country Grammar , in 2000 . All songs on Country Grammar were recorded by Steve <unk> , and mixed by Rich <unk> . Kenny <unk> provided recording assistance and Jason Standard assisted in mixing . Mastering was performed by Herb Powers , with A & R directed by Kevin Law and Coordinated by Craig <unk> . Management was provided by Tony Davis and Courtney Benson , with legality handled by Todd Rubenstein . Creative direction was handled by Sandra Brummels , with design and photography done so by <unk> Design and Jonathen Mannion , respectively .

 Much of Nelly 's rap style draws from his origins , as it contains Southern drawl with Midwestern , Missouri twang , that incorporates both country and urban styles . In conjunction , Nelly approaches a pop @-@ rap singalong vocal style , which Allmusic 's Jason Birchmeier notes present within Country Grammar 's tracks including " Ride wit Me " and " E.I. " . Peter Shapiro described Nelly 's vocals as using " unforgettable hooks based on schoolyard songs , double @-@ dutch chants , and nonsense rhymes " . Much of Country Grammar 's tracks are bass @-@ heavy , that are primarily Southern hip @-@ hop based and minimalistic . In the album 's self @-@ titled track , Nelly 's vocals are slurred and slow , and are a " smooth , slippery @-@ fast instrument " with " reggae inflections " . Rolling Stone found the song 's lyrics to depict Nelly " riding around town in an expensive SUV with an assault weapon " . " Ride wit Me " is rap , pop crossover , that samples composition from DeBarge 's 1982 " I Like It " , and its lyrics feature Nelly <unk> . Rolling Stone found the chorus of " E.I. " to contain the vocal style of rapper The Notorious B.I.G .. " Luven Me " samples " Don 't Stop ( Ever Loving Me ) " and " Whatever You Want " from bands One Way and Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! , respectively . NME interpreted " Luven Me " as a " virtual rewrite " of rapper Tupac Shakur 's 1995 " Dear Mama " .

 The AFVG ( standing for Anglo @-@ French Variable Geometry ) was a supersonic multi @-@ role combat aircraft with a variable @-@ geometry wing , being jointly developed by British Aircraft Corporation in the United Kingdom and Dassault Aviation of France . The project was cancelled in June 1967 , when the French Government withdrew from participation . BAC modified the specification to solely satisfy Royal Air Force needs , reconfiguring the design as the UKVG and sought out new partners to procure the aircraft , which ultimately emerged as the tri @-@ national consortium @-@ funded MRCA Panavia Tornado , a variable @-@ geometry wing fighter aircraft .

 The AFVG project followed on from the earlier BAC <unk> design study for a variable @-@ geometry strike / trainer / fighter aircraft for the Royal Air Force ; one of a number of proposed designs to meet <unk> 
 = = = Anglo @-@ French collaboration = = = 
 Discussions took place in 1964 between France and Great Britain on collaborative military aviation programs with Handel Davies , the co @-@ chairman of an Anglo @-@ French committee , and his French counterpart , Ingénieur @-@ General <unk> , negotiating the launch of two new military combat aircraft . The French would take the lead role in a light ground @-@ attack / trainer , while the British assumed the leadership of a swing @-@ wing multirole fighter project . 
 On 17 May 1965 , after the cancellation of the BAC TSR @-@ 2 , the British and French governments signed agreements for the two joint projects ; one based on the Breguet Aviation Br.121 ECAT ( " Tactical Combat Support Trainer " ) proposal ; this would later evolve , after the cancellation of AFVG , to become the SEPECAT Jaguar . The other was the AFVG , a larger , variable @-@ geometry carrier @-@ capable fighter aircraft for the French Navy ( Aéronavale ) as well as fulfilling interceptor , tactical strike and reconnaissance roles for the Royal Air Force . 
 = = = Design specifications = = = 
 In RAF service , the AFVG was originally intended as a fighter , replacing the English Electric Lightning . However , following the RAF 's decision to procure the F @-@ 4 Phantom II instead , the AFVG 's expected role changed in 1966 to supplementing the F @-@ 111K strike aircraft in replacing the English Electric Canberra and the V bomber force . 
 The AFVG was to be powered by two SNECMA / Bristol Siddeley <unk> turbofans , fed by Mirage @-@ style half @-@ shock cone inlets . The engine development programme contract was to be issued by the French government to a SNECMA / Bristol Siddeley joint venture company registered in France . 
 = = = Cancellation = = = 
 For Marcel Dassault , the founder of the firm that bore his name , relinquishing leadership on a major project , essentially taking a subordinate position to BAC on the AFVG threatened his company 's long @-@ term objective of becoming a premier prime contractor for combat aircraft . After less than a year , Dassault began to actively undermine the AFVG project , working on two competing " in @-@ house " projects : the variable @-@ geometry Mirage G and the Mirage F1 . 
 In June 1967 , the French government announced their withdrawal from the AFVG project ostensibly on grounds of cost . The unilateral French decision led to a censure debate in the House of Commons . By 1967 when the French withdrew from the AFVG programme , the Air Ministry was faced with a dilemma stemming from the imminent prospect of cancelling the F @-@ 111K , a decision that was taken in November 1967 , to be formalized on 20 March 1968 .

 With the prospect of no operational aircraft available to fulfill the RAF 's strike role , BAC revamped the AFVG design , eliminating the carrier capabilities that were no longer necessary , into a larger , more strike @-@ oriented VG aircraft , renamed UKVG . While funding for the UKVG in the United Kingdom was seriously restricted , the government sought partners in NATO to create a common NATO strike aircraft . This eventually led to the Multi @-@ Role Combat Aircraft ( MRCA ) project , later to become the Panavia Tornado .

 " Turning Tables " is a song by British singer Adele and the last single from her second studio album , 21 . Conceived after an altercation with her former lover , the song was co @-@ written by Adele and singer @-@ songwriter Ryan Tedder , whilst the production was completed by Jim Abbiss . " Turning Tables " is a pop ballad with a soulful sound ; its instrumentation consists of piano , " Broadway @-@ worthy " strings and guitar . Lyrically , the song describes a domestic dispute in which its narrator assumes a defensive stance against a manipulative ex @-@ lover . XL Recordings sent the song to UK mainstream radio on 5 November 2011 as fifth single from 21 along with " Rumour Has It " . 
 " Turning Tables " received acclaim from music critics , who praised Adele 's vocals and its production . The song reached the top @-@ twenty of the singles charts in four countries , including Belgium , Italy and the Netherlands . It also peaked at number 62 on the UK Singles Chart and 63 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart . It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) for selling over 500 @,@ 000 digital downloads . Adele performed " Turning Tables " on television shows such as Late Night with David Letterman in the US and The Jonathan Ross Show in the UK and included it on the Adele Live concert tour .

 In April 2009 , 20 @-@ year @-@ old Adele , who had recently embarked on her first serious relationship with a man 10 years her senior , began composing the follow @-@ up to her 2008 debut album 19 . In response to the media 's typecasting her as an " old soul " due to the vintage production and sentimental nature of her songs , Adele decided on a more upbeat and contemporary second album . However , studio sessions were generally unproductive and , after two weeks , yielded only one song recorded to the singer 's satisfaction — the Jim Abbiss @-@ produced " Take It All " , a lovelorn piano ballad not unlike the songs on 19 . Disillusioned with her lack of inspiration and the slow progress of the studio sessions , she cancelled the remaining recording dates . Adele had written " Take It All " during a difficult moment in her relationship . When she played the song for her boyfriend , the two got into a bitter argument that culminated in the end of their 18 @-@ month relationship . Heartbroken but musically stimulated , the singer channelled her rush of emotions into her music , crafting songs that examined her failed relationship from the perspectives of vengeful ex @-@ lover , heartbroken victim , and nostalgic old flame . After several recording sessions with writers and producers like Paul Epworth , Fraser T Smith and Rick Rubin , Adele got enough material for creating a full LP . She released her second studio album on 19 January 2011 under the title 21 . Adele first intended to title the album Rolling in the Deep , her adaptation of the slang phrase " roll deep " , which summarises how she felt about her relationship ; in her loose translation , the phrase refers to having someone " that has your back " and always supports you . However , the singer later deemed the title too confusing for some of her audiences . Although she had wanted to avoid the number motif of her debut , Adele considered " 21 " the most fitting title as it represented her age at the time of the album 's composition , serving as an autobiographical period piece , and symbolised the personal maturity and artistic evolution since her debut . 
 = = Writing , production and release = = 
 " Turning Tables " was written by American singer @-@ songwriter and frontman of pop @-@ rock band OneRepublic , Ryan Tedder and Adele herself . The production of the song was helmed by Jim Abbiss . When the demos to two songs were completed , Adele approached Tedder , who was in London at the time for a radio show . Tedder had expressed interest in collaborating with the singer after they met at the 2009 Grammy Awards ceremony in February . He arrived four hours early to their first studio session held at Sphere Studios in London , buying time to better familiarise himself with some of her previous work . Although unaware of Adele 's personal predicament , he composed the opening piano sequence and first few lines of " Turning Tables " . 
 Coincidentally , it perfectly captured the experience of the singer , who arrived at the studio moments after another altercation with her former lover . Angry and unfocused , she denounced her ex @-@ lover 's tendency to " turn the tables " on her during their arguments , an expression that Tedder decided to reference in the song 's lyrics . Adele recorded the demo with <unk> the following day . " Turning Tables " was mixed by Abbiss and Ian Dowling . Neil Cowley played the piano in the song , while the string arrangement was made by Chris Elliot . The strings were played by Patrick Kernan , Stephen Morris , Tom Pigott @-@ Smith , Julian Leaper , <unk> <unk> , Bruce White , Peter Lale , Rachel Stephanie Bolt , David <unk> , Caroline Dale , Warren <unk> , Jackie Shave , Chris Laurence , Rita Manning , Cathy Thompson , Emlyn Singleton and Chris <unk> . XL Recordings serviced the song to UK mainstream radio on 5 November 2011 as fifth single from 21 alongside " Rumour Has It " . On 14 December 2011 , the song was sent for airplay to Italian radio stations .

 " Turning Tables " is a pop ballad with a soulful sound that lasts for four minutes and 10 seconds . John Murphy of musicOMH recognized the single as a fragile piano ballad which shows off Adele 's voice to its best effect . Sputnikmusic 's Joseph Viney described the song as a delicate ballad that possesses an astonishing beauty . Its instrumentation consists of piano , " Broadway @-@ worthy " strings and guitar . According to the digital sheet music published by Sony / ATV Music Publishing , " Turning Tables " is written in the key of C minor and set in common time , with 78 beats per minute . Adele 's vocal range spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5 . 
 Lyrically , " Turning Tables " is a song of domestic dispute , where its narrator assumes a defensive stance against a manipulative ex @-@ lover . Reconciling herself with the termination of a contentious relationship , she vows emotional distance to shield herself from future heartbreak . Bryan Boyd of The Irish Times likened the singer to 1980s Welsh rocker Bonnie Tyler in delivering the vocals with a mixture of anger , pain and pathos . According to Paste magazine , cinematic strings " serve as fitting counterpoint to [ the song 's ] heartbroken , hollowed @-@ out lyrics . " " Turning Tables " opens with a piano sequence after which Adele sings the first lines : " Close enough to start a war / All that I have is on the floor " . The chorus consists of the lyrics : " So I won ’ t let you close enough to hurt me , No , I won ’ t ask you , you to just desert me , I can 't give you what you think you gave me , It ’ s time to say goodbye to turning tables .

On 4 September 2011 , the singer performed " Turning Tables " at the premiere of the The Jonathan Ross Show and was also interviewed . " Turning Tables " was part of the set list on Adele 's second concert tour entitled Adele Live ( 2011 ) . On 22 November 2011 , Adele unveiled a video of her performance of the song from the concert held at the Royal Albert Hall in London . The performance was later included in her first video album Live at the Royal Albert Hall which was released on 25 November 2011 . Adele described the concert as the most special show that she would ever play . Adele performed the song on 27 January 2012 at Live from the Artists Den . During the performance the singer stated : " Nothing in life moves me as much as being on stage does . I love the closeness of playing in small rooms , and this room was lovely and simple , just beautiful . " 
 " Turning Tables " was covered by American actress and singer Gwyneth Paltrow , in the " A Night of Neglect " episode of the Fox Broadcasting Company television show Glee . Her performance of the song was considered inferior to the original . Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone named it her least @-@ favorite of Paltrow 's covers to date and said that her vocals " lacked the texture that made Adele 's version so heartbreaking . " Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly gave it her lowest grade of the episode , a " B – " , and Aly Semigran of MTV opined that while Paltrow is " a nice enough singer , " she " in no way has the chops " the song requires . Whilst The Wall Street Journal 's Raymund Flandez called it a " scene @-@ stealing turn " and commended it visually and vocally , he noted that Paltrow lacks Adele 's veracity . Released as a single , this version peaked at number 66 on US Billboard Hot 100 and Canadian Hot 100 . As of 2 July 2012 , the Glee version had sold 113 @,@ 000 paid downloads in the US alone . Co @-@ writer of the song Ryan Tedder performed the song at Denver 's Acoustic Christmas ( a charity concert hosted by all Colorado artists ) with his band OneRepublic in 2011 .

 = French ironclad La Galissonnière = 
 La Galissonnière was lead ship of a class of wooden @-@ hulled , armored corvettes built for the French Navy during the 1870s . She was named after the victor of the Battle of Minorca in 1756 , Marquis de la Galissonnière . She bombarded Sfax in 1881 as part of the French occupation of Tunisia and was present in Alexandria shortly before the British bombarded it before the beginning of the 1882 Anglo @-@ Egyptian War . The ship participated in a number of battles during the Sino @-@ French War of 1884 – 85 . La Galissonnière was condemned in 1894 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The La Galissonnière @-@ class ironclads were designed as faster , more heavily armed versions of the Alma @-@ class armored corvettes by Henri Dupuy de Lôme . They used the same central battery layout as their predecessors , although the battery was lengthened 4 meters ( 13 ft 1 in ) to provide enough room to work the larger 240 @-@ millimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns . A two @-@ propeller layout was adopted in an unsuccessful attempt to reduce the ship 's draft . 
 La Galissonnière measured 76 @.@ 62 meters ( 251 ft 5 in ) between perpendiculars , with a beam of 14 @.@ 84 meters ( 48 ft 8 in ) . She had a mean draft of 6 @.@ 55 meters ( 21 ft 6 in ) and displaced 4 @,@ 654 metric tons ( 4 @,@ 580 long tons ) . The ship had a metacentric height of .926 meters ( 3 ft 0 @.@ 5 in ) . Her crew numbered between 352 and 382 officers and men . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 La Galissonnière had two Wolf vertical compound steam engines , each driving a single 3 @.@ 8 @-@ meter ( 12 ft 6 in ) propeller . Her engines were powered by four oval boilers . On sea trials the engines produced a total of 2 @,@ 370 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 770 kW ) and the ship reached 13 @.@ 08 knots ( 24 @.@ 22 km / h ; 15 @.@ 05 mph ) . La Galissonnière carried 500 metric tons ( 490 long tons ) of coal which allowed the ship to steam for 3 @,@ 240 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 000 km ; 3 @,@ 730 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She was ship @-@ rigged with three masts and had a sail area around 1 @,@ 707 square meters ( 18 @,@ 370 sq ft ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The ship mounted four of her six 240 @-@ millimeter Modèle 1870 guns in the central battery on the battery deck . The other two 240 @-@ millimeter guns were mounted in barbettes on the upper deck , sponsoned out over the sides of the ship , abaft the funnel . La Galissonnière 's secondary armament of four 120 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns was also mounted on the upper deck . They were replaced by six 100 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) guns in 1880 . The armor @-@ piercing shell of the 19 @-@ caliber 240 @-@ millimeter gun weighed 317 @.@ 5 pounds ( 144 @.@ 0 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 15 @.@ 41 long tons ( 15 @.@ 66 t ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 624 ft / s ( 495 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 14 @.@ 4 inches ( 366 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells . 
 The ship received four 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss 5 @-@ barrel revolving guns in 1878 . They fired a shell weighing about 500 g ( 1 @.@ 1 lb ) at a muzzle velocity of about 610 m / s ( 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ) to a range of about 3 @,@ 200 meters ( 3 @,@ 500 yd ) . They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute . La Galissonnière also received several towed Harvey torpedoes . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 La Galissonnière had a complete 150 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) wrought iron waterline belt , approximately 2 @.@ 4 meters ( 7 @.@ 9 ft ) high laid over 650 millimeters ( 26 in ) of wood . The sides of the battery itself were armored with 120 millimeters ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) of wrought iron backed by 520 millimeters ( 20 in ) of wood and the ends of the battery were closed by bulkheads of the same thickness . The barbette armor was 120 millimeters ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) thick . The unarmored portions of their sides were protected by thin iron plates . 
 = = Service = = 
 La Galissonnière was laid down at Brest on 22 June 1868 and launched on 7 May 1872 . While the exact reason for such prolonged construction time is not known , the budget for the French Navy was cut after the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1870 – 71 and the French dockyards had not been reformed with working practices more suitable for the industrial age . The ship began her sea trials on 20 April 1874 and was not commissioned until 18 July 1874 . She became flagship of the Pacific Squadron on 16 May 1874 under the command of Rear Admiral <unk> . She return to Brest on 19 March 1877 , having circumnavigated the world via the Suez Canal . The ship was placed in reserve upon her return until she recommissioned on 15 August 1878 in preparation for a commission as flagship of the Caribbean Squadron which began on 6 October under Rear Admiral Peyron . Two years later she sailed to Cherbourg and was reduced to reserve on 13 May 1880 . 
 La Galissonnière became the flagship of the Levant Squadron ( French : Division Navale du Levant ) under Rear Admiral Alfred Conrad on 27 May 1881 . Shortly afterward she bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax in July 1881 as part of the French occupation of Tunisia . In early 1882 La Galissonnière was present in Alexandria shortly before the British bombarded it before the beginning of the 1882 Anglo @-@ Egyptian War . The ship remained in the Mediterranean through 1883 . 
 La Galissonnière relieved her half @-@ sister Victorieuse in April 1884 as the flagship of the Far East Squadron , under the command of Vice Admiral Amédée Courbet , just in time to participate in the Sino @-@ French War of 1884 – 85 . The ship fought in the late stages of the Battle of Fuzhou in August 1884 when she tried to pass a Chinese fort ( known to the French as Fort <unk> ) defending the entrance to the Min River . La Galissonnière failed to destroy the fort and was lightly damaged by a shell that struck her bow . It damaged her steam capstan and killed one man . The ship supplied landing parties during the Battle of Tamsui in October 1884 , but they were forced to retreat by Chinese troops , although only nine men were killed . Nothing is known of any further participation by La Galissonnière in the war . She was ordered home in February 1886 and laid up for the last time in Cherbourg upon her return . The ship was condemned on 24 December 1894 . 
 = Beck 's Bolero = 
 " Beck 's Bolero " is a rock instrumental recorded by English guitarist Jeff Beck in 1966 . It is Beck 's first solo recording and has been described as " one of the great rock instrumentals , epic in scope , harmonically and rhythmically ambitious yet infused with primal energy " . " Beck 's Bolero " features a prominent melody with multiple guitar parts propelled by a rhythm inspired by Ravel 's Boléro . 
 The recording session brought together a group of musicians , including Jimmy Page , Keith Moon , John Paul Jones , and Nicky Hopkins , who later agreed that the line up was a first attempt at what became Led Zeppelin . However , there is an ongoing disagreement over the composer as well as producer credits . Despite being credited solely to Page , Beck claims that he made significant contributions to the composition . Likewise , Page and Simon Napier @-@ Bell each claim to have produced it , while Mickie Most received the credit . 
 " Beck 's Bolero " was not released until ten months after recording and then only as the B @-@ side to Beck 's first single . When it finally received greater exposure on Beck 's debut album Truth in the latter part of 1968 , it was still considered quite advanced even though it was over two years old . Beck continues to perform it and several renditions have been recorded by other musicians . 
 = = Background = = 
 The recording session for " Beck 's Bolero " was conceived of as a side project for Jeff Beck while he was a member of the Yardbirds . " It was decided that it would be a good idea for me to record some of my own stuff ... partly to stop me moaning about the Yardbirds " , Beck recalled . Also , the Yardbirds ' management was encouraging individual band members to bring attention to the band through success in solo projects . Studio time was booked for May 1966 at the IBC Studios in London . To prepare for the session , Beck called on long @-@ time friend and studio guitarist Jimmy Page , who had recommended Beck as Eric Clapton 's replacement in the Yardbirds , to work up some ideas for songs to record . 
 Although there is a disagreement over credits for the composition , both Beck and Page agree that Page began by playing some chords on a twelve @-@ string guitar using a rhythm based on Boléro . Boléro is a one @-@ movement orchestral piece composed by Maurice Ravel in 1928 and is " built on a persistent , repeating motif supported by a snare drum ... re @-@ creating the Spanish ' bolero ' dance pattern for full orchestra " , according to Beck biographer Martin Power . A melody line for guitar was developed along with a middle section to break up the rhythm , reminiscent of the Yardbirds ' arrangements for " For Your Love " and " Shapes of Things " . 
 With at least the outline of one song and Page on board to play guitar , Beck approached Keith Moon of the Who , whom he considered one of his favourite drummers . Moon was unhappy with the Who at the time and readily agreed to participate . To avoid a confrontation with Pete Townshend and Kit Lambert , the Who 's manager , Moon wished to do so incognito . He recommended bandmate John Entwistle , who was similarly discontented with the Who , to provide the bass . 
 = = Recording = = 
 The recording session took place at IBC Studios on 16 and 17 May 1966 ( although a date after Beck left the <unk> in November 1966 has also been suggested ) . Moon arrived at the studio disguised in sunglasses and a Russian cossack hat . When Entwistle did not show , studio musicians John Paul Jones and Nicky Hopkins were brought in at the last minute to provide bass and piano . Although there is an unsubstantiated account that Ritchie Blackmore may have been somehow involved at the studio , his participation has not been acknowledged by Beck , Page , or the others at the session . Napier @-@ Bell , the <unk> 's producer who had originally promoted the idea , was present for the recording . 
 For the guitar parts , Beck used a Gibson Les Paul played through a Vox AC30 amplifier and Page played a Fender Electric XII twelve @-@ string electric guitar . Half way through the song , Moon smashed the drum microphone with his stick – " You can actually hear him screaming as he does it " , Beck remembered , " so all you can hear from then on is cymbals ! " After Moon and Napier @-@ Bell left , Beck and Page added overdubs and sound treatments to complete the track . According to Beck , two or three songs were recorded at the session , but " Beck 's Bolero " was the only track released . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Beck 's Bolero " is roughly divided into three parts . The first begins with a reworking of Ravel 's two @-@ chord progression , transposed to the key of A. Power points out that by using a 12 @-@ string guitar , Page is able to take advantage of the instrument 's " rich chiming quality to emulate the distinct , orchestral ' bolero ' sound " . Beck then introduces the melody line on electric guitar with a fuzz @-@ tone effect producing indefinite sustain ; alternating between major and minor modes , it is described as " haunting " by Power and as a " distinctive piercing , sinister tone " by critic Richie Unterberger . In the second section , the piano , bass , and drums come in and the tension builds . Unterberger describes the third section as " suddenly set [ ting ] off from the main motif into a beautiful serene section highlighting slide @-@ glissando guitars " , with Beck 's echo @-@ laden slide sounding similar to a steel guitar . The fourth section returns to the main melody with overlaid drawn @-@ out descending slide . According to Beck , " the phasing was Jimmy 's idea ... I played a load of waffle and he reversed it " . The tension mounts as Moon adds drum flourishes , climaxing with a break . 
 The second part begins with Moon 's simultaneous drum break and scream and launches in different , hard rock direction . " It was my idea to cut off in the middle , Yardbirds @-@ style " , Beck commented , " Keith upped the tempo and gave it an extra kick . It 's like a bit of the Who , a bit of the Yardbirds and a bit of me " . The amply @-@ distorted guitar provides " a thick @-@ toned , descending riff " , according to Power . He also describes the break , inspired by the Yardbirds ' rave @-@ up technique , as " eerily <unk> [ ing ] the coming era of hard rock and heavy metal " . The third part returns to the main motif with added guitar fills . The melody line is abandoned in the second section and replaced with multiple interwoven takes of guitar effects , including phasing , echo , and controlled feedback . It concludes with a few bars of hard blues rock @-@ style lead guitar and an abrupt ending . 
 = = Releases = = 
 The record release of " Beck 's Bolero " was delayed for ten months , when Jeff Beck began his solo career after leaving the Yardbirds . It appeared as the B @-@ side of his first single , " Hi Ho Silver Lining " , which was released on 10 March 1967 in the UK ( Columbia DB <unk> ) and 3 April 1967 in the US ( Epic 5 – <unk> ) . The initial UK pressing of the single listed the title as " Bolero " with Jeff Beck as the composer , while later pressings showed " Beck 's Bolero " and " J. Page " . The single reached number fourteen in the UK Singles Chart , and number 123 in the US Billboard 's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart . " Hi Ho Silver Lining " was ignored by American underground FM radio , but " Beck 's Bolero " became a staple of the new radio format . 
 In 1968 , the instrumental gained wider exposure when it was included on the Jeff Beck Group debut album , Truth . Released in the US in July , the album reached number 15 in the Billboard 200 album chart one month later . Truth was issued in October in the UK , but it did not appear in the album charts . On the British monaural releases , " Beck 's Bolero " has a fifteen @-@ second backwards guitar coda . This version is included as a bonus track on the 2006 remastered Truth CD and on the <unk> Records reissue of the original mono vinyl album . The original album liner notes do not list the personnel for " Beck 's Bolero " – Jones ' and Hopkins ' contributions are noted for other songs along with " Timpani by ' You Know Who ' " , the " Who " being Moon . 
 " Beck 's Bolero " remains one of Beck 's favourites pieces and he has performed it numerous times , often as his opening number . A live version in 2008 appears on his Live at Ronnie Scott 's album and video . On 4 April 2009 , Page formally inducted Beck into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and together they performed " Beck 's Bolero " at the induction ceremony , with Page playing the original 1965 Fender XII electric twelve @-@ string guitar which he used for the 1966 recording session . 
 = = Disagreement over credits = = 
 = = = Production = = = 
 Beck 's later producer , Mickie Most , the Yardbirds ' producer , Simon Napier @-@ Bell , and Jimmy Page have each claimed to be the recording 's producer . At the time of the release of " Beck Bolero " , Beck was under contract to producer Most . Although he was not involved in the recording , under the terms of the contract , Most received a " mandated production credit " and it is his name that appears on the single and album credits . Napier @-@ Bell , who was at least present for the recording , has claimed that his involvement was substantial : 
 I produced it , but I was naive about ' Bolero ' . When Mickie Most took Jeff , he asked if there were any productions knocking around and I said ' Yes , we 've got ' Bolero ' . ' So it eventually came out as a Mickie Most production , which has always pissed me off because it was such a great record . My fault , no one else 's . 
 However , according to Jimmy Page , " the track was done and then the producer , Simon Napier @-@ Bell , just disappeared ... [ he ] just sort of left me and Jeff to do it . Jeff was playing and I was [ at the recording console ] . " Page asserts that he in fact was the instrumental 's actual producer . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 The initial Columbia Records pressing of the single listed the title as " Bolero " and " Jeff Beck " as the composer . However , Jimmy Page filed for the composer credit for " Beck 's Bolero " and it is his name that appears on the credits for all but the initial release . Nonetheless , Beck has claimed credit for his contributions to the composition . Both Beck and Page agree that Page came up with the Boléro @-@ influenced chords and rhythm . However , Beck specifically claims that key features of the instrumental — the haunting melody line and the second part " hard @-@ rock " break — are his . Beck adds that the break contains " the first heavy metal riff ever written and I wrote it " . While not addressing the specifics , Page asserts " I wrote it , played on it , produced it ... and I don 't give a damn what [ Jeff ] says . That 's the truth " , but adds " the slide bits are his " . Beck later put it behind him , " No , I didn 't get a songwriting credit , but you win some and lose some down the years " . Over the years , he and Page have made several appearances together in concerts and for interviews . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Beck , Page , Hopkins , Jones , and Moon were pleased with the outcome of the recording session and there was talk of forming a working group and additional recordings . This led to the famous quip , " Yeah , it 'll go down like a lead zeppelin " , which Page later used , with a slight spelling change , for his new group . Page ascribed it to Moon , while Beck 's and Led Zeppelin 's later manager Peter Grant claimed Moon used the phrase " go down like a lead balloon " , to which Entwistle added " more like a lead zeppelin " . Entwistle , on the other hand , insists that he came up with the name independently along with the idea of using an image of " a Zeppelin going down in flames " for an album cover . Led Zeppelin biographer Keith Shadwick notes that forming an actual group at the time " was never a realistic option " , due to existing contractual obligations . 
 For all their attempts at secrecy , Townshend learned of Moon 's move . Beck recalled , " I remember [ Pete ] Townshend looking daggers at me when he heard it ... because it was a bit near the mark . He didn 't want anybody meddling with that territory [ his band , the Who ] at all " . Townshend also took to referring to Beck and Page as " flashy little guitarists of very little brain " for their perceived subterfuge ( Page responded with " Townshend got into feedback because he couldn 't play single notes " ) . In a later interview , Townshend explained 
 The thing is when Keith did Beck 's ' Bolero ' , that wasn 't just a session , that was a political move . It was at a point when the group was very close to breaking up . Keith was very paranoid and going through a heavy pills thing . He wanted to make the group plead for him because he 'd joined Beck . 
 Differences with Moon were resolved and he returned to the Who shortly after the recording . One month later , Page joined the Yardbirds and together with Beck became one of the first dual @-@ lead guitar teams in popular rock . In 1968 , Hopkins became a member of the Jeff Beck Group and for performances of " Beck 's Bolero " during their first US tour in June , singer Rod Stewart played the rhythm guitar part . Also in 1968 , Page started Led Zeppelin with Jones . Page incorporated some of the melody line and bolero rhythm into the medley portion of " How Many More Times " for the Led Zeppelin debut album . 
 " Beck 's Bolero " appears on various " best of " lists and in Guitar Masters : Intimate Portraits , Alan di Perna describes it as " one of the great rock instrumentals , epic in scope , harmonically and rhythmically ambitious yet infused with primal energy " . The May 1966 recording pre @-@ dated other mid @-@ 1960s hard rock / psychedelic rock milestones , such as the formation of Cream , Jimi Hendrix 's arrival in England , the Beatles ' Revolver album , and the rise of the San Francisco Sound . Guitarist Mike Bloomfield recalled that " Beck 's Bolero " had a " significant impact on Jimi Hendrix , who named it among his favorite tracks " . Beck recalled performing a live version with Hendrix on lead guitar , but a recording has not been forthcoming . 
 According to Paul Hornsby , who played with Duane Allman in Hour Glass in 1967 – 1968 before the Allman Brothers Band , " Beck 's Bolero " inspired Allman to take up slide guitar . After hearing Beck 's record , Allman " loved that slide part and told me he was going to learn to play it " , Hornsby recalled . In 1970 , Joe Walsh adapted the slide @-@ guitar section of " Beck 's Bolero " for a James Gang song . Titled " The Bomber " , the multi @-@ part suite also includes a rendition of Ravel 's Boléro and appears on the James Gang Rides Again album . Several artists have recorded renditions of " Beck 's Bolero " , including SRC , the Posies , Les Fradkin , Eric Johnson , and Return to Forever . 
 = Operation Labrador = 
 Operation Labrador was a false flag operation carried out by the Yugoslav Air Force 's Counterintelligence Service ( KOS ) in the Croatian capital city of Zagreb during the early stages of the Croatian War of Independence . It was devised as a series of terrorist attacks intended to create an image of Croatia as a pro @-@ fascist state . Two bombings were carried out on 19 August 1991 , with one at the Jewish Community Centre and a second near Jewish graves at the <unk> Cemetery ; there were no casualties . Additional attacks targeted the national railway network and were designed to implicate the Croatian President . Operation Labrador was complemented by Operation Opera — a propaganda campaign devised by the KOS to feed disinformation to the media . 
 Further activities of Operation Labrador were abandoned in September , after Croatian authorities captured the Yugoslav Air Force regional headquarters in Zagreb , and confiscated documents related to the operation . The authorities took nearly a month to analyze the captured documents , allowing time for the principal agents involved in the bombings to flee . Fifteen others were arrested in connection with the attack , but they were subsequently released in a prisoner exchange . Five KOS agents involved in Operation Labrador were tried in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on terrorism charges and acquitted . Croatian authorities captured two KOS agents who were part of the operation and tried them along with seven other agents who were tried in absentia . Those in custody were acquitted , while those tried in absentia were convicted . 
 The existence of Operation Labrador was further confirmed through the testimony of a former KOS agent , Major Mustafa Čandić , during the trial of Slobodan Milošević at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 2002 . 
 = = Background = = 
 In August 1990 , an insurrection took place in Croatia centering in the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland near Knin , the Lika , Kordun , and Banovina regions , and eastern Croatia . The areas were subsequently named SAO Krajina ( Serb Autonomous Oblast ) and , after local leaders announced their intention to integrate SAO Krajina with Serbia , the Government of Croatia declared the SAO Krajina secession movement a rebellion . By March 1991 , the conflict had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence . In June 1991 , Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated . A three @-@ month moratorium followed , after which the declaration came into effect on 8 October 1991 . The SAO Krajina , renamed Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) on 19 December 1991 , responded with a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Croatian civilians . 
 With the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) lending support to SAO Krajina leadership and the Croatian Police unable to cope with the situation , the Croatian National Guard ( ZNG ) was formed in May 1991 . The development of the military of Croatia was hampered by a UN arms embargo introduced in September , while the military conflict in Croatia continued to escalate . The JNA maintained substantial forces in the Croatian capital , Zagreb , throughout 1991 . 
 = = Bombings = = 
 In August 1991 , the Yugoslav Air Force 's Counterintelligence Service ( KOS ) executed a series of activities , codenamed Operation Labrador , aimed at discrediting the new Croatian government . Operation Labrador was planned to include several terrorist attacks that would go hand @-@ in @-@ hand with the activities of Operation Opera — a propaganda campaign devised to feed disinformation to the media . The two operations were intended to portray Croatia as a pro @-@ fascist state . An alternative name for Operation Opera was Operation Opera @-@ <unk> , or Operation Opera Orientalis . 
 Operation Labrador was headed by Colonel General Slobodan <unk> , head of the Yugoslav Air Force branch of the KOS , based in Zemun . In Zagreb , operational control of Labrador was assigned to Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Sabolović , and Major Čedo Knežević . Lieutenant Colonel Radenko Radojčić was tasked with the storage of a substantial quantity of explosives in Zagreb and its surrounding areas and the subsequent planting of explosive devices in designated locations . The explosives and other munitions were stored across several sites . 
 On 19 August , the Jewish Community Centre in <unk> Street in Zagreb , and Jewish graves at the <unk> Cemetery , were bombed as a part of Operation Labrador . The explosions caused property damage , but resulted in no casualties . There were no public claims of responsibility for the attack . Aside from the two explosions in Zagreb , agents assigned to Operation Labrador were thought to also be responsible for bombing the Zagreb – Belgrade railway near Vinkovci and a railway line between Glina and Vojnić . The railway attacks have also been ascribed to Operation Opera . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In the immediate aftermath of the bombings in Zagreb , Josip Manolić , who had just been appointed head of the Croatian intelligence service , claimed Croatian right @-@ wing extremists were responsible . Operation Labrador was abandoned after the ZNG and the Croatian police captured the Yugoslav Air Force headquarters in Zagreb on 15 September 1991 , during the Battle of the Barracks . The materials captured inside the facility included codes and computer disks related to Operation Labrador , as well as Sabolović 's notes . Sabolović turned the materials over to his immediate superior at headquarters , Mirko Martić , but Martić failed to destroy them . In response , Sabolović fled Zagreb . Croatian police took almost a month to analyze the captured materials properly and uncover Operation Labrador . Sabolović later claimed that only a part of the Operation Labrador network was dismantled , but he was contradicted by KOS Major Mustafa Čandić who was posted at the Zemun headquarters of KOS . 
 In autumn of 1991 , Croatian intelligence services launched Operation <unk> ( Operacija <unk> ) aimed at dismantling the remaining KOS network in Croatia . The operation was a joint operation of all Croatian intelligence services . It was authorized by Ivan Vekić and Gojko Šušak , then interior and defence ministers , and initially headed by Josip <unk> . Fifteen suspects were arrested by the end of 1991 ; they were subsequently exchanged for Anton <unk> , who was captured by the JNA while smuggling a plane @-@ load of weapons to Croatia . The operation also produced a list of suspected KOS operatives in Croatia containing 1 @,@ 789 names and pseudonyms . 
 <unk> , Sabolović , Radojčić and two other former KOS agents were tried in Belgrade in 1993 . The five were charged with instigation of terrorism and other crimes , but all were acquitted . Radojčić was arrested again in Zagreb in late 1993 . The second Trial of Radojčić and eight other suspects charged in connection with Operations Labrador and Opera , held in Zagreb , ended with the acquittal of Radojčić and <unk> <unk> , who were in custody , and the convictions of the other defendants who were all tried in absentia . 
 Testifying at the Trial of Slobodan Milošević at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 2002 , Čandić stated that all Operation Labrador agents left Zagreb and took the remaining documents with them . He also said that the KOS had an extensive network of informants within Croatian intelligence services and the ruling Croatian Democratic Union in 1991 . Čandić also testified that the railway bombing near Vinkovci was intended to implicate Croatian President Franjo Tuđman . 
 Bomb damage to the Jewish Community Centre was repaired between February and September 1992 , using government funds .

The road reaches an intersection with Mt . Cuba Road in the community of Mount <unk> where it heads northwest on Creek Road and parallels the Red Clay Creek and the Wilmington and Western Railroad . It continues on a winding alignment and passes over the creek twice before crossing the railroad two times . Along this stretch , the road passes through the community of Ashland and by the Ashland Nature Center . 
 The route reaches the community of Yorklyn , where it turns southwest briefly . After making a turn to the northwest to continue on Creek Road , DE 82 continues north alongside the Red Clay Creek with the Wilmington and Western Railroad heading to the southwest . A short distance past Yorklyn , the route reaches the Pennsylvania border , where it becomes PA 82 and continues toward Kennett Square , Pennsylvania . 
 The entire length of DE 82 is a part of the Red Clay Scenic Byway , a designation given to several roads in the Red Clay Creek valley . The Red Clay Scenic Byway is a part of the Delaware Byways system . DE 82 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 4 @,@ 682 vehicles at the southern terminus at DE 52 to a low of 197 vehicles at Mt . Cuba Road . None of DE 82 is part of the National Highway System .

 When Delaware started numbering state highways in the 1930s , what is now DE 82 was originally an unnumbered road . By 1952 , DE 82 was created on its current alignment to connect PA 82 to DE 52 near Greenville . DE 82 was incorporated into the Red Clay Scenic Byway , the second scenic byway in Delaware , in 2005 . In 2010 , DelDOT considered removing the DE 82 designation in order to preserve the route as a scenic byway . After a public workshop on the proposed designation removal was held , DelDOT decided in April 2010 to keep the DE 82 designation due to strong opposition from area residents on the plan .

 = History of cardistry = 
 Cardistry is a portmanteau of cards and artistry . The art form of card flourishing , commonly referred to as cardistry , grew out of simple flourishes used in close @-@ up magic by magicians in the 1990s to early 2000s . Chris Kenner 's notable two @-@ handed Sybil cut from his 1992 publication Totally Out of Control has carried great influence and gave birth to a series of advanced flourishes which today represents the foundation of the performance art . Sleight of hand pioneers Dan and Dave popularized cardistry on the world stage with their instructional DVD releases from 2004 and 2007 . Journalist Kevin Pang of Vanity Fair characterized the art of card flourishing as , " It 's yo @-@ yo tricks performed by <unk> with the street cred of a Parkour video . There 's a name for it : cardistry . " 
 = = Roots in magic = = 
 When conjuring tricks with playing cards became popular around the 19th century , magicians would often include card flourishes in their performances to demonstrate their sleight of hand abilities . Unlike tricks , flourishes were intended to be visually impressive and appear difficult to perform . Some of the first flourishes to be documented include the Charlier Cut , Riffle Shuffle and Thumb Fan . Several sleight of hand bestsellers , such as S. W. <unk> 's The Expert at the Card Table from 1902 ( which shared roots in gambling and cheating at cards ) , emphasized the importance of incorporating flourishes into tricks . Up until the 2000s , card flourishing were considered a mere subsection of close @-@ up magic and not an independent performance art . 
 Cardistry is a portmanteau of " card " and " artistry " . It involves the use of hands to create cuts , displays , fans , patterns and sequences through the use of playing cards . Various <unk> , cuts , shuffles and springs can be used . The intent is to create a captivating motion and beautiful display . The effects are limited only by the types of cars used , the imagination , and the degree of manual dexterity of the performer . The presentation is typically neither " illusionary " nor purportedly " magic " . At least in part , the color and form of cards affect visual perceptions of the act . The visual style of the art form is often associated or compared to juggling , <unk> @-@ sack , mimes and even skateboarding . 
 = = Five Faces of Sybil = = 
 In 1992 , American magician and David Copperfield producer Chris Kenner published Totally Out of Control , a successful instructional book explaining magic effects with playing cards and other household objects . Among the many sleights featured was a two @-@ handed card flourish on page 125 called " The Five Faces of Sybil " . Using all fingers , Sybil ends with the deck divided into five distinct packets . Kenner himself describes Sybil in his book as " a quick cut flourish to demonstrate skill and dexterity " . The flourish spawned a cycle of two @-@ handed cut creations and formed the cornerstone of what is now known as cardistry . Journalist Kevin Pang of Vanity Fair magazine noted that " every cardist can deftly perform Sybil the way guitarists can run through a blues progression " . 
 = = An art form = = 
 Los Angeles @-@ based magician Brian Tudor was one of many performers heavily influenced by Sybil . In 1997 , he released a three @-@ volume VHS tape dubbed Show Off , one of the first instructional products made by a known magician to only feature flourishes . Tudor 's tape was well received , with some critics describing the flourishes and cuts taught as " eye @-@ popping " . The most notable invention from Show Off was the one @-@ handed Revolution Cut , a variation of the common Charlier , where the top packet spins an additional 180 degrees . 
 In 2001 , twin brothers and Sybil enthusiast Daniel and David Buck ( known as Dan and Dave ) released <unk> Animations , another flourish @-@ only instructional VHS tape . Although produced as a low @-@ fi home video and relatively short compared to Show Off , it sold hundreds of copies at hotel lobbies and magic conventions at a cost of $ 25 . In a Genii magazine review of the Magic Live convention in August 2001 , the twins flourishes and <unk> Animations tape received mixed responses . Renowned magic historian <unk> Ian Swiss remarked : 
 " It was an excellent show , though opinion was definitely mixed about the Buck boys , who sat and stared at their hands while oddly racing through flourishes . It serves no function except as eye candy . It 's juggling , and juggling and magic are two separate things . Nevertheless , it 's fucking cool to watch . Cool is cool is cool , capital C cool . And magic is traditionally uncool . It 's always been the geeky kids . " 
 In spite of the mixed responses from the traditional magic scene , Dan and Dave continued with their cardistry creations . In 2004 , with the help of Kenner , the twins released an instructional DVD on cardistry named The Dan and Dave System . The System is perceived as having officially separated advanced card flourishing from card magic and defined the style of cardistry . Filmed with digital movie cameras at film studios and professional edited , the critically praised $ 30 DVD inspired thousands of sleight of hand artists all over the world to embark on cardistry . Four years later , the twins released a three @-@ disc DVD set known as The Trilogy , showcasing some of the most comprehensive and difficult flourishes ever created . Retailing at $ 85 per copy , The Trilogy is the bestselling cardistry release of all time , having sold more than 25 @,@ 000 units . Pang wrote that just about every cardist lists either the System or The Trilogy as the reason they got into card flourishing . 
 In a 2015 interview , Singaporean cardist Kevin Ho mentioned that cardistry grew in popularity during the 2000s because of promotion through social media and journalistic coverage . Another cardist from Singapore , Huron Low , explained : 
 " A lot of new doors are opening . <unk> companies and watch companies want to see product placements [ in our videos ] . And there 's a lot of focus now on cardistry as a lifestyle brand — caps , T @-@ shirts . " 
 = = Cardistry convention = = 
 In response to the growing cardistry community , Dan and Dave organized the first cardistry convention and interactive conference to promote the performance art in 2014 , called Cardistry @-@ Con. The convention saw interviews , panel discussions , live performances , exclusive video screenings , workshops , contests and giveaways . The 2015 convention was attended by journalists from magazines such as Vanity Fair and Wired as well as television stations , all of which helped further popularize cardistry as an art . Its growth has been associated with its availability with the availability of videos , lessons and podcasts , which tend to make the art more transparent and available to all who are interested . 
 = = Tools = = 
 Decks of playing cards are an essential part of the cardist 's tools . Ordinary playing cards will do . However , they are not fungible goods ; and some have the opinion that those chosen should be particularly adapted to the task , even though they can be rare and relatively expensive – flexibility , stickiness , colors and decorations ( both front and back ) vary . However , older <unk> cards , sometimes called " poop decks " , are preferred by others .

 It is no secret that cardistry , like magic generally , is populated mainly by males . Some have observed that the split is roughly 9 to 1 , male @-@ to @-@ female . The reasons and remedies , if any , are subject to dispute .

 = Zero Patience = 
 Zero Patience is a 1993 Canadian musical film written and directed by John Greyson . The film examines and refutes the urban legend of the alleged introduction of HIV to North America by a single individual , Gaëtan Dugas . Dugas , better known as Patient Zero , was tagged in the popular imagination with the blame in large measure because of Randy Shilts 's history of the early days of the AIDS epidemic , And the Band Played On . The film tells its story against the backdrop of a romance between a time @-@ displaced Sir Richard Francis Burton and the ghost of " Zero " ( the character is not identified by Dugas ' name ) . 
 Produced in partnership with the Canadian Film Centre , the Canada Council , Telefilm Canada and the Ontario Film Development Corporation , Zero Patience opened to mixed reviews but went on to win a number of prestigious Canadian film awards . The film has been the subject of critical attention in the context of both film theory and queer theory and is considered part of the informal New Queer Cinema movement . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 Victorian adventurer and sexologist Sir Richard Francis Burton ( John Robinson ) , following an " unfortunate encounter " with the Fountain of Youth in 1892 , is 170 years old and living in Toronto , Canada . Burton , now living and working as the chief taxidermist at a Museum of Natural History , is searching for a centerpiece display for an exhibit in his Hall of Contagion . He comes up with the idea of featuring AIDS and the Patient Zero hypothesis . Accepting the popular belief that Zero introduced the virus to North America , Burton sets out to collect video footage from those who knew Zero to support the hypothesis . When Zero 's doctor ( Brenda Kamino ) , mother ( Charlotte <unk> ) and former airline colleague Mary ( Dianne <unk> ) , who is now with ACT UP , all refuse to demonize Zero , Burton manipulates the footage to make it appear as if they do and includes doctored photographs of Zero showing signs of Kaposi 's sarcoma . He presents this preliminary version to the press . 
 The ghost of Zero ( Normand <unk> ) materializes at a local gay bathhouse . No one can see or hear him , until Zero runs into Burton while Burton is spying on Zero 's friend George . Zero realizes that Burton can see him , although Zero does not show up on Burton 's video camera . The two strike a deal ; Zero agrees to help Burton with his Patient Zero exhibit if Burton finds a way to make Zero appear . 
 The two return to the museum where Burton makes a ridiculous attempt to seduce Zero to ensure his participation . Rejecting his advances , Zero examines some of the other exhibits ( including displays on Typhoid Mary and the Tuskegee syphilis study ) before finding an African green monkey , another suspected early AIDS vector . The monkey ( Marla <unk> ) angrily denounces Zero for scapegoating her just as he has been scapegoated . Zero turns to Burton and they make love . 
 Under pressure from his director and the exhibit 's drug manufacturer sponsor , Burton steals Zero 's medical records in hopes of discovering new information . Zero and Burton examine an old blood sample of Zero 's under a microscope and discover Miss HIV ( Michael Callen ) , who points out that the original study that was used to label Patient Zero as the first person to bring HIV to North America did not prove any such thing , but instead helped prove that HIV was sexually transmitted , leading to the development of safer sex practices . Under this interpretation , Zero could be lauded as a hero for his candor in participating in that original study . As Burton ponders this , an unknown fluid squirts from the eye pieces of the microscope , drenching Zero and making him appear on video . He joyously declares his innocence on tape but the effect only lasts five minutes before he fades away again . Zero angrily accuses Burton of not caring for him at all and only wanting to use him for the exhibit , then storms out . 
 Burton fails to complete the revised Patient Zero exhibit before its scheduled opening date . The museum curator substitutes the original presentation instead over Burton 's protests , leading to a renewed rush of press scapegoating Zero . The night after the exhibit opens , Mary and other ACT UP members break into the Hall of Contagion and trash the exhibit . Zero returns and Burton explains that he tried to stop the exhibit . Zero forgives Burton but says he wants to disappear again completely . Zero merges with his disfigured video image and , smoking a cigarette inside the video , sets off the fire alarm . The sprinklers destroy the video player and Zero vanishes . 
 A major subplot involves George ( <unk> <unk> @-@ Douglas ) , a French teacher and former intimate of Zero 's . George is losing his sight to cytomegalovirus and is taking a drug that is manufactured by a company that , as a member of ACT UP , George is protesting . George struggles through the film to resolve his conflicted feelings over this , his guilt over abandoning Zero during the final days of his illness and his fear that the same thing will happen to him .

 John Greyson became interested in offering a counterpoint to the Patient Zero story as early as 1987 , when the Patient Zero meme began entering the public consciousness following the publication of Randy Shilts 's book And the Band Played On . The book described the cluster study which led to the popular identification of flight attendant Gaëtan Dugas as the vector through which HIV was first brought to North America . It should be noted , however , that Shilts himself never claimed that Dugas was the first . In early 1991 Greyson was given a development grant for the script from the Canadian Film Centre , of which Greyson is an alumnus . Over the next year Greyson , in collaboration with Film Centre partners Louise Garfield and Anna Stratton , continued to develop the script , eventually presenting it with producer Alexandra <unk> in a workshop format . During the first half of 1992 , the production team secured additional development funding from the Canada Council , Telefilm Canada and the Ontario Film Development Corporation . By June of that year the script and the songs were completed and that autumn , with funds from the Telefilm Canada and <unk> grants along with revenue from the sale of British broadcast rights to Channel 4 , pre @-@ production and casting got underway . Principal photography began in November 1992 and wrapped after five weeks . Sneak previews took place at the Seattle International Film Festival and a number of LGBT film festivals across the United States before its official debut in September 1993 at Toronto 's Festival of Festivals . 
 In dedicating the film 's soundtrack album to performer and AIDS activist Michael Callen and other friends they had lost to the disease , Greyson , composer Glenn Schellenberg and producers Garfield and Stratton explained their reasons for making the film . " We wanted to explode the opportunistic myth of Patient Zero .... More importantly , we wanted to celebrate the courage and sass of an international AIDS activist movement that has tirelessly fought for the rights of people living with AIDS . "

 Zero Patience garnered mixed critical reaction .

In a contrary favorable opinion , London 's Time Out Film Guide praised the film for " slyly inverting popular wisdom " to " offer a sassy commentary on the epidemic of blame " and calling Zero Patience " a film which engages your mind as much as your heart , and leaves you laughing . " Similarly , The New York Times lauded the film 's " loopy buoyancy , " praising the songs as a " bouncy stylistic hybrid of Gilbert and Sullivan , Ringo Starr , The Kinks and the Pet Shop Boys . " 
 Zero Patience was honored as the Best Canadian Film and Best Ontario Feature at the 1993 <unk> and was awarded a Special Jury Citation as Best Canadian Feature Film at the 1993 Festival of Festivals . Greyson dedicated his award to the memory of Jay Scott , the influential film critic who had died of AIDS a few months earlier .

 In examining the film from a queer theory perspective , author Michele Aaron cites Zero Patience as definitional of one of the New Queer Cinema 's central attitudes , the " def [ <unk> ] of cinematic convention in terms of form , content and genre .

" Feminist academic and AIDS video producer Alexandra <unk> puts forth the film as " an effective critique of the silly sensationalism used in much reportage of AIDS science [ that ] fights melodrama and tabloid journalism -- with melodrama and tabloid journalism . " Not all such critical commentary has been positive , with openly gay film scholar Robin Wood ( who saw the film when someone very close to him was in the final stages of AIDS ) calling the film " misguided on the levels both of conception and execution .

After some deliberation about whether it " violated the website ’ s rules on nudity and sexual content " the video was restored to their website . Upton 's Cat Daddy video clip was a part of Terry Richardson 's vlog . Richardson has a reputation for " raunchy " artwork . According to the Los Angeles Times the video was removed on May 1 , 2012 while the Daily News reported its removal was May 2 . 
 Both agree that the video was restored late on May 2 , although Fox News reports that it was initially restored with an age restriction . During the YouTube ban , Upton 's Cat Daddy gained exposure at Vimeo when Richardson uploaded it there in response to the ban . As of November 12 , 2015 , her version of the dance has received about 25 @.@ 7 million YouTube views . 
 Following Upton 's April 30 rendition , The Rej3ctz were impressed enough with Upton that they attempted to contact her regarding future collaboration ( s ) . On the June 21 , 2012 edition of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon she performed a fully clothed rendition of the " Cat Daddy " alongside Fallon . Prior to performing the dance she described the movements of the dance as buckling a seatbelt and rolling a wheelchair . YouTube now hosts videos of numerous celebrities doing the Cat Daddy including Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber .

 The Siege of Szigetvár or Battle of Szigeth ( pronunciation : [ <unk> ] Hungarian : Szigetvár <unk> , Croatian : Bitka <unk> <unk> or <unk> bitka , Turkish : <unk> Kuşatması ) was a siege of the fortress of Szigetvár , Kingdom of Hungary , that blocked Suleiman 's line of advance towards Vienna in 1566 AD . The battle was fought between the defending forces of the Habsburg Monarchy under the leadership of Nikola Šubić Zrinski ( Hungarian : Zrínyi Miklós ) , former Ban of Croatia , and the invading Ottoman army under the nominal command of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent ( Ottoman Turkish : سليمان Süleymān ) . 
 After the Battle of Mohács in 1526 , which resulted in the end of the independent Kingdom of Hungary , Ferdinand I was elected King by the nobles of both Hungary and Croatia . This was followed by a series of conflicts with the Habsburgs and their allies , fighting against the Ottoman Empire . In the Little War in Hungary both sides exhausted themselves after sustaining heavy casualties . The Ottoman campaign in Hungary ceased until the offensive against Szigetvár . 
 In January 1566 Suleiman went to war for the last time . The siege of Szigetvár was fought from 5 August to 8 September 1566 and , though it resulted in an Ottoman victory , there were heavy losses on both sides . Both commanders died during the battle — Zrinski in the final charge and Suleiman in his tent from natural causes . More than 20 @,@ 000 Turks had fallen during the attacks and almost all of Zrinski 's 2 @,@ 300 man garrison was killed , with most of the final 600 men killed on the last day . Although the battle was an Ottoman victory , it stopped the Ottoman push to Vienna that year . Vienna was not threatened again until the Battle of Vienna in 1683 . 
 The importance of the battle was considered so great that the French clergyman and statesman Cardinal Richelieu was reported to have described it as " the battle that saved civilization . " The battle is still famous in Croatia and Hungary and inspired both the Hungarian epic poem The Siege of Sziget and the Croatian opera Nikola Šubić Zrinski .

 On 29 August 1526 the forces of the Kingdom of Hungary led by King Louis II were defeated at the Battle of Mohács by Ottoman forces led by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent . Louis died in the battle which resulted in the end of the independent Kingdom of Hungary , as he died without an heir . Both Hungary and Croatia became disputed territories with claims from both the Habsburg and Ottoman empires . Ferdinand I from the House of Habsburg , brother of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V , married the sister of Louis II and was elected King by the nobles of both Hungary and Croatia . 
 The throne of Hungary became the subject of a dynastic dispute between Ferdinand and John Zápolya from Transylvania . Suleiman had promised to make Zápolya the ruler of all Hungary . Ferdinand set out to enforce his claim on Hungary and captured Buda from John Zápolya in 1527 , only to relinquish his hold on it in 1529 when an Ottoman counter @-@ attack stripped Ferdinand of all his territorial gains during 1527 and 1528 . The Siege of Vienna in 1529 was the first attempt by Suleiman the Magnificent to capture the Austrian capital . This siege signalled the pinnacle of Ottoman power and the maximum extent of Ottoman expansion in central Europe . 
 = = = Little War = = = 
 The years from 1529 to 1552 were known as the " Little War " . Following Suleiman 's unsuccessful siege of Vienna in 1529 Ferdinand launched a counter @-@ attack in 1530 to regain the initiative . An assault on Buda was driven off by John Zápolya , although Ferdinand was successful elsewhere — capturing Gran ( Esztergom ) and other forts along the Danube river , a vital strategic frontier . 
 Suleiman 's response came in 1532 when he led a massive army of over 120 @,@ 000 troops to besiege Vienna again . Ferdinand withdrew his army , leaving only 700 men with no cannons and a few guns to defend Güns ( <unk> ) although Ibrahim Pasha , the Grand Vizier of the Ottomans , did not realize how poorly defended <unk> was . Suleiman came to join him shortly after the siege had started . For more than twenty five days Croatian captain Nikola Jurišić and his garrison of 800 Croats held out against nineteen full @-@ scale assaults and an incessant bombardment by the Ottomans . As a result , the city was offered a surrender on favourable terms and , although the offer was rejected , the Ottomans retreated leading to a peace treaty between Ferdinand and Suleiman . John Zápolya was recognized as the King of Hungary by the Habsburgs , although as an Ottoman vassal . 
 The treaty did not satisfy either John Zápolya or Ferdinand and their armies began skirmishes along the borders . In 1537 Ferdinand attacked John ’ s forces at Osijek in violation of the treaty . The siege was a disaster of similar magnitude to that of Mohács , with an Ottoman relief army smashing the Austrians . Rather than attack Vienna again Suleiman attacked Otranto in southern Italy . Nonetheless , an Ottoman victory at the naval Battle of Preveza ( 1538 ) gave the Habsburg @-@ led coalition another defeat . 
 John Zápolya died in 1540 and was succeeded by his infant son John II Sigismund Zápolya . For much of his reign the country was governed by his mother Isabella Jagiellon , with continued support from Suleiman . John II remained as nominal King of Hungary until he abdicated in 1570 and returned the country to Habsburg rule . 
 A further humiliating defeat was inflicted on the Habsburgs in the Siege of Buda ( 1541 ) when the Ottomans responded to a request for help from Isabella Jagiellon . In April 1543 Suleiman launched another campaign in Hungary , taking back Bran and other forts so that much of Hungary returned to Ottoman control . In August 1543 the Ottomans succeeded in the Siege of Esztergom ( 1543 ) which was followed by the capture of three Hungarian cities : Székesfehérvár , Siklós and Szeged , offering better security for Buda . 
 Another peace agreement between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans lasted until 1552 when Suleiman decided to attack Eger . The siege proved futile and the Habsburg victory reversed a period of territorial losses in Hungary . The survival of Eger gave the Austrians good reason to believe that Hungary was still a contested ground and the Ottoman campaign in Hungary ceased , until its revival in 1566 . 
 = = Campaign of 1566 = = 
 In January 1566 Sultan Suleiman I had ruled the Ottoman Empire for 46 years and went to war for the last time . He was 72 years old and , although having gout to the extent that he was carried on a litter , he nominally commanded his thirteenth military campaign . On 1 May 1566 the Sultan left Constantinople at the head of one of the largest armies he had ever commanded . 
 His opposite number , Count Nikola Šubić Zrinski , was one of the largest landholders in the Kingdom of Croatia , a seasoned veteran of border warfare , and a Ban ( Croatian royal representative ) from 1542 to 1556 . In his early life he distinguished himself in the Siege of Vienna and pursued a successful military career . 
 Suleiman 's forces reached Belgrade on 27 June after a forty @-@ nine @-@ day march . Here he met with John II Sigismund Zápolya who he earlier promised to make the ruler of all Hungary . Learning of the Zrinski 's success in an attack upon a Turkish encampment at Siklós , Suleiman decided to postpone his attack on Eger ( German : <unk> ) and instead attack Zrinski 's fortress at Szigetvár to eliminate him as a threat . 
 = = = Siege = = = 
 The advanced guard of the Turks arrived at on 2 August 1566 and the defenders made several successful sorties causing considerable loss to the Turks . The Sultan arrived with the main force on 5 August and his big war tent was erected on the <unk> hill , giving him a view of the battle . The Sultan had to stay in his camp where he received verbal battle progress reports from his Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha , the real operational commander of the Ottoman forces . 
 Count Zrinski found himself besieged by a hostile army of at least 150 @,@ 000 soldiers with powerful artillery . Zrinski had assembled a force of around 2 @,@ 300 Croatian and Hungarian soldiers prior to the siege . These consisted of his personal forces and those of his friends and allies . The majority of the defenders were Croatian , with a significant Hungarian contingent represented in both the men @-@ at @-@ arms and the leadership . 
 Szigetvár was divided into three sections divided by water : the old town , the new town and the castle — each of which was linked to the next by bridges and to the land by causeways . Although it was not built on particularly high ground the inner castle , which occupied much of the area of today 's castle , was not directly accessible to the attackers . This was because two other baileys had to be taken and secured before a final assault on the inner castle could be launched . 
 When the Sultan appeared before the Fortress he saw the walls hung with red cloth , as though for a festive reception , and a single great cannon thundered once to greet the mighty warrior monarch . The siege began on 6 August when Suleiman ordered a general assault on the ramparts , although the attack was successfully repulsed . Despite being undermanned , and greatly outnumbered , the defenders were sent no reinforcements from Vienna by the imperial army . 
 After over a month of exhausting and bloody struggle the few remaining defenders retreated into the old town for their last stand . The Sultan tried to entice Zrinski to surrender , ultimately offering him leadership of Croatia under Ottoman influence , Count Zrinski did not reply and continued to fight . 
 The fall of the castle appeared inevitable but the Ottoman high command hesitated . On 6 September Suleiman died in his tent and his death was kept secret at great effort with only the Sultan 's innermost circle knowing of his demise . This was because the Ottomans feared that their soldiers would give up the battle if they knew that their leader died , so his death was kept secret for 48 days . A courier was dispatched from the camp with a message for Suleiman 's successor , Selim . The courier may not even have known the content of the message he delivered to distant Asia Minor within a mere eight days . 
 = = = Final battle = = = 
 The final battle began on 7 September , the day after Suleiman 's demise . By this time , the fortress walls had been reduced to rubble by mining with explosives and wood fueled fires at the corners of the walls . In the morning an all @-@ out attack began with fusillades from small arms , " Greek fire " , and a concentrated cannonade . Soon the castle , the last stronghold within Szigetvár , was set ablaze and cinders fell into the apartments of the count . 
 The Ottoman army swarmed through the city , drumming and yelling . Zrinski prepared for a last charge addressing his troops : 
 Zrinski did not allow the final assault to break into the castle . As the Turks were pressing forwards along a narrow bridge the defenders suddenly flung open the gate and fired a large mortar loaded with broken iron , killing 600 attackers . Zrinski then ordered a charge and led his remaining 600 troops out of the castle . He received two musket wounds in his chest and was killed shortly afterwards by an arrow to the head . Some of his force retired into the castle . 
 The Turks took the castle and most of the defenders were slain . A few of the captured defenders were spared by Janissaries who had admired their courage , with only seven defenders managing to escape through the Ottoman lines . Zrinski 's corpse was beheaded and his head taken to the new Sultan while his body received an honourable burial by a Turk who had been his prisoner , and well treated by him . 
 = = = Powder magazine explosion = = = 
 Before leading the final sortie by the castle garrison , Zrinski ordered a fuse be lit to the powder magazine . After cutting down the last of the defenders the besiegers poured into the fortress . The Ottoman Army entered the remains of Szigetvár and fell into the booby trap , thousands perished in the blast when the castle 's magazine exploded . 
 The Vizier Ibrahim 's life was saved by one of Zrinski 's household who warned him of the trap when the Vizier and his troops searched for treasure and interrogated the survivors . While inquiring about treasure the prisoner replied that it had been long expended , but that 3 @,@ 000 lbs of powder were under their feet to which a slow match had been attached . The Vizier and his mounted officers had just enough time to escape but 3 @,@ 000 Turks perished in the explosion . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Almost all of Zrinski 's garrison was wiped out after the final battle . Ottoman casualties were also heavy . Three pashas , 7 @,@ 000 Janissaries and 28 @,@ 000 other soldiers are said to have perished . Sources vary on the exact number with estimates ranging from 20 @,@ 000 – 35 @,@ 000 . 
 After the battle the Grand Vizier forged bulletins in the Sultan 's name , proclaiming victory . These announced that the Sultan regretted that his current state of health prevented him from continuing with the successful campaign . His body was returned to Constantinople while the inner circle of officials pretended to keep up communication with him . Turkish sources state that the illusion was maintained for three weeks and that even the Sultan 's personal physician was strangled as a precaution . 
 It is likely that the long journey and the siege had a detrimental effect on the Sultan 's health . His death meant that any advances were postponed as the Grand Vizier had to return to Constantinople for the succession of the new Sultan , Selim II . Even if Suleiman had lived his army could not have achieved much in the short time that remained between the fall of Szigeth and the onset of winter . The prolonged resistance at Szigeth delayed the Ottoman push to Vienna . 
 Two <unk> were sent by Emperor Maximilian : Croatian Antun <unk> and Styrian Christoph <unk> . They arrived in Istanbul on 26 August 1567 and were well received by Sultan Selim II . An agreement ending the war between the Austrian and Ottoman empires was reached on 17 February 1568 , after five months of negotiations with Sokollu Mehmed Pasha ( also known as Mehmed @-@ paša Sokolović , being originally from Bosnia ) . The Treaty of Adrianople was signed on 21 February 1568 . Sultan Selim II agreed to an eight @-@ year truce , although the agreement brought 25 years of ( relative ) peace between the Empires until the Long War . The truce was conditional and Maximilian agreed to pay an annual tribute of 30 @,@ 000 ducats .

 The Croatian Renaissance poet and writer <unk> <unk> , from Zadar , wrote The Conquest of the City of Sziget ( Croatian : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) sometime before 1573 . His work was posthumously published in 1584 in Venice . This is the first Croatian historical epic dealing with national history and the Battle of Szigetvár . It was inspired by Marko Marulić 's <unk> . 
 The battle was also immortalized in the Hungarian epic poem Szigeti <unk> ( " Peril of Sziget " ) , written in fifteen parts by Zrinski 's great @-@ grandson Nicholas VII of Zrin ( also a Ban of Croatia ) in 1647 and published in 1651 . This was one of the first such epics in the Hungarian language and was also inspired by Marulić 's <unk> . Kenneth Clark 's renowned history Civilisation lists the Szigeti <unk> as one of the major literary achievements of the 17th century . In spite of the author and other members of Zrinski family being fierce enemies of the Turks , the poem never <unk> them . The Turks are portrayed as human beings and a love story between <unk> the Tatar and the Sultan 's daughter <unk> is interwoven into the main plot . 
 Petar Zrinski ( Hungarian : Zrínyi Péter ) , the brother of Nikola VII Zrinski , published <unk> <unk> ( 1647 / 8 ) in the Croatian language — not surprising since the Zrinski family were bilingual . 
 Another Croatian nobleman warrior @-@ poet Pavao Ritter <unk> ( 1652 – 1713 ) wrote about the battle . His poem <unk> <unk> ( " The Sziget Farewell " ) , first published in 1684 , reminisces about the event without rancour or crying for revenge . The last of the four cantos is titled " Tombstones " and consists of epitaphs for the Croatian and Turkish warriors who died during the siege , paying equal respect to both . 
 Ivan <unk> 's 1876 opera Nikola Šubić Zrinski is his most famous and popular work in Croatia . This recounts the heroic defiance of the Croats towards the Turks , as a metaphor for their later nationalist impulses within the Habsburg monarchy . 
 Zrinski is depicted in the plot as a 16th @-@ century Croatian hero who defeated the Turks a couple of times before perishing <unk> , along with his family and close supporters , in the siege of Szigeth castle . The opera is patriotic with a famous aria " U <unk> , u <unk> " . 
 = Tiberius Julius Alexander = 
 Tiberius Julius Alexander ( fl . 1st century ) was an equestrian governor and general in the Roman Empire . Born into a wealthy Jewish family of Alexandria but abandoning or neglecting the Jewish religion , he rose to become procurator of Judea ( c . 46 – 48 ) under Claudius . While Prefect of Egypt ( 66 – 69 ) , he employed his legions against the Alexandrian Jews in a brutal response to ethnic violence , and was instrumental in the Emperor Vespasian 's rise to power . In 70 , he participated in the Siege of Jerusalem as Titus ' second @-@ in @-@ command . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Tiberius Julius Alexander was probably born early in the reign of the Emperor Tiberius ( 14 – 37 ) . His father was Alexander , an Alexandrian Jew who held the office of <unk> ; the exact meaning of this term is debated , but it may have denoted a senior customs official . The older Alexander enjoyed Roman citizenship , a rare privilege among the Jews of Alexandria , and therefore passed it to his sons . He also had business connections both with Agrippa , grandson of Herod the Great , and with Antonia , mother of the emperor Claudius . Another prominent member of Tiberius Alexander 's family was his uncle , the philosopher Philo . 
 Tiberius ' younger brother Marcus Julius Alexander would follow their father into business , becoming a partner in an import @-@ export firm . Marcus Julius Alexander was the first husband of Herodian Princess Berenice . Marcus died in 43 or 44 , leaving no children . Tiberius himself decided differently , setting out upon a military and administrative career in the service of the Roman Empire . When introducing Tiberius , the Jewish historian Josephus condemns him for his impiety and explains that he " did not remain in his ancestral customs " . This has traditionally been taken to mean that he became an apostate from Judaism at an early age , a view which finds some support in his appearance as a character in two of Philo 's philosophical dialogues , making arguments against divine providence which Philo attempts to refute . However , some more recent scholars believe that Josephus is criticizing Alexander simply for his decision to take up the service of Rome , placing the interests of the Empire above the Jewish religion . 
 He nevertheless continued to benefit from his family 's connections , which were enhanced after the Emperor Claudius came to power in 41 . Agrippa had helped to secure Claudius ' accession after the assassination of Caligula , and was appointed king of Judea . Tiberius ' father , who had been imprisoned by Caligula , was released on Claudius ' orders , and his younger brother Marcus became first husband to Agrippa 's daughter Berenice .
