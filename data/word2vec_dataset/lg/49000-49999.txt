 Construction of the second section started in 2007 and was completed in 2011 . The section between Sandvika and Lysaker is 6 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 2 mi ) , most of which runs through the 5 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 3 @.@ 4 mi ) Bærum Tunnel . There was local debate whether the tunnel should be built using a tunnel boring machine or by drilling and blasting . The latter was preferred by the Rail Administration , since it allowed a shorter construction time , and a NOK 700 million saving . Total budget is NOK 2 @,@ 787 million . 
 = = = Lysaker Station = = = 
 Lysaker Station serves as the main public transport hub for Eastern Bærum , parts of Western Oslo and Fornebu . Within 800 metres ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) , there are 20 @,@ 000 jobs , with an additional 10 – 15 @,@ 000 in development . Located 7 @.@ 00 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 35 mi ) west of Oslo S , it is receiving a major overhaul between 2006 and 2009 , including 1 @.@ 2 km ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) of new track . The current station will be entirely replaced , and the number of platforms increased from two to four . More than one thousand buses depart from Lysaker Station each day , and it has been proposed as the terminus of the Fornebu Line — a tramway originally proposed as a people mover . 
 The NOK 1 billion renovation has become a scandal , due to the station being built in a curve , and thus does not have straight platforms . This will become a security problem ; in addition it will create a gap up to 40 centimetres ( 16 in ) between the train and the platform , hindering accessibility to the trains for disabled people . Norges Statsbaner claims they will have to buy new trains due to this station alone , costing the state @-@ owned company NOK 1 @.@ 5 billion . Minister of Transport , Liv Signe Navarsete from the Centre Party , has said that resolving the problems by building a straight station is not an alternative , since it would cost an additional hundred @-@ millions of NOK , and delay the new station several years . 
 = = = Lysaker – Skøyen = = = 
 The last section is a proposed 2 @.@ 1 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @.@ 3 mi ) section from Lysaker to Skøyen ; the latter not being modified as part of the extension , since it was upgraded in 1999 . The government has not set a date to start construction , but it will not be until at least 2020 , since other projects will be prioritised over this section . No specific route has been finalised , and the project has been proposed to either run parallel to the current Drammen Line , or by placing all four tracks through a new tunnel . The former has been preferred by the Rail Administration , while the latter — which would cost NOK 1 billion more — has been preferred by the municipality . There are no intermediate commuter stations between Skøyen and Lysaker , so there is little regularity or speed potential to gain from the construction , since the Oslo Tunnel from Skøyen to Oslo Central Station will still remain a bottleneck with only two tracks . Advocates have claimed that there is no gain from building this section without building two additional tracks all the way to the central station . 
 = = Operation = = 
 Norges Statsbaner ( NSB ) operates their express trains on the Bergen and Sørland Line on the Asker Line , along with the regional trains along the Vestfold Line . They also operate some of Oslo Commuter Rail trains , that do not stop on the intermediate stations . Other commuter trains use the old Drammen Line , along with freight trains . However , in 2006 , the night freight trains were moved to the new line , despite operating at less than 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) . The Flytoget airport express train operates along the line three times per hour using Class 71 multiple units , connecting the main stations west of Oslo to Oslo Airport , Gardermoen . 
 With the opening of the new line , NSB stopped operating their commuter trains from Drammen to Oslo with stops at <unk> , Hvalstad and Billingstad . Passengers from Drammen now need to transfer in Asker , but all other passengers have travel times reduced from 48 to 36 minutes . 
 = Dakota , Minnesota and Eastern Railroad = 
 The Dakota , Minnesota and Eastern Railroad ( reporting mark DME ) is a Class II railroad subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway operating across South Dakota and southern Minnesota in the Northern Plains of the United States . Portions of the railroad also extend into Wyoming , Nebraska and Iowa . 
 DM & E began operations on September 5 , 1986 , over trackage spun off from the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company in South Dakota and Minnesota . Many of the negotiations were handled by the office of Senator Larry Pressler and his legal counsel Kevin V. Schieffer . After DME 's successful first decade , Schieffer succeeded J. C. McIntyre as president of the railroad on November 7 , 1996 . 
 DM & E purchased the assets of I & M Rail Link railroad in 2002 , renaming it Iowa , Chicago and Eastern Railroad . DM & E combined its management and dispatching duties with those of ICE under the holding company Cedar American Rail Holdings . The combined system directly connects Chicago through Iowa to Kansas City , Minneapolis @-@ St. Paul and continues as far west as Rapid City , South Dakota . Smaller branches extend into portions of Wisconsin , Wyoming and Nebraska . 
 In September 2007 it was announced that Canadian Pacific Railway ( CP ) would acquire the DM & E upon approval by the Surface Transportation Board of the US Department of Transportation . The STB announced its approval of the purchase plan on September 30 , 2008 . The merger was completed , and the official last day of operations for the DM & E was October 30 , 2008 . 
 = = 1986 – 1996 : Startup and initial expansion = = 
 In the early 1980s , Chicago and North Western Railway ( CNW ) announced plans to abandon a section of railroad through Minnesota and South Dakota that dated to 1859 . Due to pressure from customers and Senator Larry Pressler from South Dakota , a deal was reached and announced on April 24 , 1986 , creating the Dakota , Minnesota and Eastern Railroad out of sections of CNW from Winona , Minnesota , to Rapid City , South Dakota . This deal also included buildings , rolling stock and locomotives , mostly rebuilt EMD <unk> , from the CNW . 
 DM & E began operations on this track on September 5 , 1986 . The railroad was expanded in 1995 when it acquired additional former CNW branch lines from Rapid City , South Dakota , to Colony , Wyoming , and Crawford , Nebraska . 
 From startup to the railroad 's ten @-@ year anniversary in 1996 , DM & E hauled nearly 500 @,@ 000 carloads of freight , which includes 700 million bushels of grain . DM & E celebrated the anniversary with picnics and employee appreciation events and excursions in Waseca , Minnesota , and Pierre , South Dakota . 
 Kevin V. Schieffer , whom former United States President George H. W. Bush had appointed as US Attorney for South Dakota in 1991 , became president of DM & E on November 7 , 1996 . Schieffer was no newcomer to the railroad ; he first became involved with DM & E in 1983 when he worked to prevent the abandonment of the former CNW lines that eventually formed the first sections of DM & E 's mainline . Maintaining the status quo on DM & E was not the fate that he had in mind for the railroad as he took the reins . 
 = = 1997 – 2006 : plans for expansion into the Powder River Basin = = 
 = = = Expansion plans = = = 
 In 1997 , DM & E announced plans to expand into the Powder River Basin ( PRB ) in Wyoming and start providing unit coal train service from that area . The railroad filed an application for the expansion to the Surface Transportation Board ( STB ) on February 20 , 1998 . Burlington Northern Railroad built into this area in 1979 , and the Chicago and North Western Railway ( CNW ) also sought to access the PRB coalfields , a project accomplished by CNW 's successor Union Pacific Railroad . DM & E would become the third railroad to tap into the coal deposits in the region . 
 DM & E 's expansion would require the construction of 281 miles ( 452 km ) of new track , upgrading 598 miles ( 962 km ) of existing track ( including all of the railroad 's mainline track in Minnesota ) , new mainline connections Owatonna and Mankato , Minnesota , and three new rail yards . The plan would be the largest new railroad construction in the United States since the completion of Milwaukee Road 's Pacific extension to Seattle , Washington , in 1909 . 
 = = = Initial approval and lawsuits = = = 
 The STB approved the application on December 10 of that year pending completion of an Environmental Impact Statement ( EIS ) , which was released by the STB on September 27 , 2000 . 
 An analysis of the plan by Minnesota 's Dakota , Minnesota and Eastern Railroad Working Group in 2001 showed support among customers and freight shippers , but DM & E 's expansion plan led to complaints among residents in communities along the railroad 's right @-@ of @-@ way . While some communities welcomed the railroad 's expansion plan as an opportunity for increased business within their own cities , other residents and businesses felt that roads in the area were not built with enough overpasses and underpasses to deal with the traffic flow problems that the longer and more frequent unit trains would produce at grade crossings . The objectors cited concerns of the general public in safely and quickly traversing their communities as well as the ability of emergency vehicles to cross the tracks to reach emergency scenes or hospitals . The city of Rochester , Minnesota filed a lawsuit to force the railroad to build a bypass around the city . The bypass was estimated to cost around US $ 100 million . 
 = = = Further legal actions = = = 
 After a period of public comment that lasted until March 16 , 2001 , and further review by the STB , the final EIS was issued on November 19 , 2001 . In this final approval , the STB agreed with DM & E that no new bypasses around cities would be required even though the cities of Rochester , Minnesota , Brookings and Pierre , South Dakota , had requested them . In 2003 , a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ordered the STB to re @-@ examine potential environmental issues around Rochester . The STB 's preliminary report , released in early 2005 , noted that no additional steps were needed by the railroad to alleviate noise and vibration caused by the projected increase in train traffic . 
 The court upheld the STB 's approval with stipulations for the new line 's environmental impact , including the projected increase in the frequency of train horn soundings along the line . From the court 's ruling , the STB prepared a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement which sets forth mitigation strategies for the railroad . On February 15 , 2006 , the United States Surface Transportation Board ( STB ) announced its final approval of the railroad 's 1998 application . 
 In April 2004 , DM & E was awarded the power of eminent domain in South Dakota by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Pierre , South Dakota . The ruling overturned part of South Dakota legislation passed in 1999 ( two years after the railroad first announced its intentions to expand ) that would have impaired railroad operations and construction in the state . This decision restores the legal process by which the railroad can effectively force landowners along the proposed new route to sell their land to the railroad . 
 = = = Funding = = = 
 With the final EIS in place and approval from the STB , DM & E had the authority to undertake the expansion as proposed , but needed financing . On February 26 , 2007 , the FRA rejected a proposed $ 2 @.@ 3 billion loan to DM & E. In announcing the decision , Administrator Joseph H. Boardman noted that the project proposal met many federal requirements for the loan but cited concerns that the railroad might not be able to handle cost overruns during construction or to repay such a hefty amount after construction is completed . 
 = = 2002 – 2007 : consolidation with IC & E = = 
 DM & E hauled nearly 60 @,@ 000 carloads of various freight shipments in fiscal year 2002 , serving approximately 130 customers along the railroad 's mainline . Of these shipments , 53 % were grains or grain products , 24 % were bentonite and kaolin clay , 7 % were cement , and 5 % were wood and lumber products ; the remaining 11 % were split among all other types of freight . 
 On February 21 , 2002 , DM & E announced that it would purchase the railroad assets of 1 @,@ 700 @-@ mile ( 2 @,@ 700 km ) I & M Rail Link ( <unk> ) from its then current owners Washington Corporation . DM & E renamed the <unk> property to Iowa , Chicago and Eastern Railroad ( IC & E ) and began operating it under that name on July 30 , 2002 . Although a purchase price was not stated in the original announcement , an article in the May 2002 Trains Magazine suggests that several industry sources believed the total to be around $ 150 million . 
 DM & E and IC & E combined management under the holding company Cedar American Rail Holdings . Locomotives of both railroads were given a unified paint scheme ( see below ) and interchanges were streamlined between the two railroads . The administration of both railroads is handled by Cedar , further streamlining processes between the two railroads . As a result , the combined DM & E / IC & E system makes up the largest Class II railroad ( by route @-@ miles ) in the United States ; it is also the eighth largest system of all American railroads and the only system with direct rail connections with all Class I railroads in North America . 
 In its first twenty years of operations , the railroad 's revenues had increased more than tenfold , from $ 22 million in 1987 to $ 258 million in 2006 , with $ 290 million projected in 2007 and $ 340 million for 2008 . Its operating ratio ( the ratio of operating expenses to revenues ) declined to 70 @.@ 2 % in 2006 and was projected to improve further to 67 @.@ 6 % in 2007 . Its traffic was a mix of agricultural , coal , and industrial products , and ethanol shipments were projected to exceed one billion gallons in 2008 . 
 = = Acquisition by Canadian Pacific Railway = = 
 On September 4 , 2007 , the Canadian Pacific Railway ( CPR ) announced it was acquiring the DM & E from its owners , London @-@ based Electra Private Equity , for US $ 1 @.@ 48 billion , and future payments of over $ 1 @.@ 0 billion contingent on commencement of construction on the Powder River extension and specified volumes of coal shipments from the Powder River basin . The transaction will include the ICE and other affiliated companies . The merger is an " end @-@ to @-@ end " consolidation ; the lines presently interchange at three points , including the Winona , Minnesota connection between the DM & E 's main line across southern Minnesota and CP 's Chicago main . Kevin Schieffer , president of the DM & E , has called CP the DM & E 's " natural partner " and the transaction a " natural fit " . 
 The acquisition will give CP access to shipments of agricultural products and ethanol in addition to coal from the Wyoming coal fields . CP has stated its intention to use this purchase to gain access to the Powder River and ship coal to midwestern and eastern utilities . The transaction is subject to approval of the Surface Transportation Board , which is expected to take a year . Securities analysts have stated that competing railroads for Powder River coal , the Union Pacific and BNSF , could challenge the acquisition and delay STB approval , but are unlikely to prevent it . At least until approval is received , the DM & E will continue to operate as a separate entity . 
 On October 4 , 2007 , CP announced that it has completed the financial transactions to acquire the DM & E and subsidiaries . Control of DM & E has been placed into a voting trust with Richard Hamlin appointed as trustee ; the trust will remain in effect until the STB issues its decision on the acquisition . CP plans to integrate DM & E 's operations once it receives STB approval . CP expected STB approval of the purchase in October 2008 . The STB announced its approval of the purchase plan on September 30 , 2008 , with no conditions other than those that CP had already agreed to in the original plan ; the effective date of the purchase was October 30 , 2008 . CP assumed control of DM & E and IC & E on October 30 , 2008 . CP plans to invest $ 300 million in capital improvements to the former DM & E lines by 2011 .

 On December 3 , 2012 , CP announced it was indefinitely placing on hold plans for building new trackage into the Powder River Basin . The next day the railroad announced its intention to sell the entire ex @-@ DM & E west of Tracy , Minnesota , roughly 700 miles ( 1 @,@ 100 km ) of track . On January 2 , 2014 CP announced that all track west of Tracy , Minnesota was to be sold to Rapid City , Pierre and Eastern Railroad , a subsidiary of Genesee & Wyoming , a short line operator . The sale was completed on May 30 , 2014 for $ 210 million . Most of the Rapid City , Pierre and Eastern 's employees came over from the DM & E.

 DM & E originally purchased used first @-@ generation locomotives from a variety of railroads ; in the early years it was more common to see a locomotive with a Milwaukee Road or Chicago and North Western Railway paint scheme than a DM & E paint scheme . Over the years , the locomotives were repainted , and many of them are now in DM & E 's paint scheme ( which is closely mirrored by that of sister Iowa , Chicago and Eastern Railroad ) of blue with a yellow stripe along its length . 
 DM & E eventually assigns names to all of its locomotives when they are repainted , usually after locations along its right @-@ of @-@ way , but a few exceptions have been named for people ( like road number 550 , named after Senator Larry Pressler ) . All of the first @-@ generation diesel locomotives purchased from Chicago and North Western and Milwaukee Road have since been replaced with more recent locomotives , although the newer locomotives were also bought used . 
 In 1987 , at the railroad 's one @-@ year anniversary , DM & E owned 39 locomotives and leased five more for a total of 44 locomotives rostered . By the railroad 's tenth anniversary in 1996 , DM & E owned 69 locomotives and owned or leased over 1 @,@ 500 cars including over 600 covered hoppers for grain and cement shipments . In 2001 , the number of locomotives owned stayed about the same , while the number of cars increased to about 5 @,@ 000 with 52 % of them in dedicated grain service . 
 = = Company officers = = 
 DM & E has had three men serve as president of the railroad : 
 J. C. ( Pete ) McIntyre ( 1986 – 1996 ) began his railroad career in 1953 , eventually working for Chicago and North Western in the early 1980s . When DM & E was formed in 1986 , McIntyre became the new railroad 's first president . 
 Kevin V. Schieffer ( 1996 – 2008 ) served as counsel for Senator Larry Pressler starting in 1982 . Schieffer began working with DM & E business in 1983 when he worked to prevent the abandonment of C & NW branch lines that would eventually form the beginnings of DM & E. He initiated the negotiations in 1985 that led to DM & E 's creation . He was promoted to Chief of Staff for Senator Pressler in 1987 , a position he held until 1991 when United States President George H. W. Bush appointed Schieffer to be US Attorney for South Dakota . In 1993 , Schieffer left his US Attorney post and became the legal counsel for DM & E ; as legal counsel for the railroad , he oversaw the railroad 's recapitalization in 1994 and the acquisition of C & NW 's Colony line . He held this position until he was unanimously elected president of the railroad on November 7 , 1996 . Schieffer left the DM & E on October 7 , 2008 , shortly after the Surface Transportation Board approved the proposed purchase of the railroad by Canadian Pacific ; DM & E 's COO Ed <unk> and CFO Kurt Feaster were named to manage the railroad until CP completed the acquisition October 30 , 2008 . 
 Vern Graham ( 2008 – 2010 ) was appointed president November 5 , 2008 .

 Javier Alfonso López ( born July 11 , 1977 ) is a Puerto Rican @-@ born professional baseball pitcher for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball . He is 6 feet 5 inches ( 1 @.@ 96 m ) tall and weighs 220 pounds ( 100 kg ) . López previously pitched for the Colorado Rockies ( 2003 – 2005 ) , Arizona Diamondbacks ( 2005 ) , Boston Red Sox ( 2006 – 09 ) and Pittsburgh Pirates ( 2010 ) . He is a left @-@ handed specialist known for his sidearm delivery . He also bats left @-@ handed . 
 López attended the University of Virginia , earning a degree in psychology despite leaving early to begin his baseball career . He was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the fourth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball ( MLB ) Draft . He began his career as a starting pitcher but struggled and converted into a sidearm ( or submarine ) reliever while still in the Diamondbacks ' organization . Before the 2003 season , he was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the Rule 5 draft , but he was traded to the Colorado Rockies during spring training . He spent all of 2003 on Colorado 's roster , nearly tying the franchise record for most consecutive batters retired and finishing third among major league rookies in games pitched . He struggled the next two seasons , getting claimed off waivers and later sent to the minors by Arizona in 2005 . In 2006 , he signed with the Chicago White Sox but failed to make the team and spent the first part of the season in the minors before getting traded to Boston during the year . 
 López served four stints with Boston in 2006 . In 2007 , he had three different stints but appeared in 61 games , posting a 3 @.@ 10 earned run average ( ERA ) . He posted a 15 @.@ 43 ERA in the playoffs but won his first World Series ring as the Red Sox defeated Colorado in four games . In 2008 , he spent the entire season on a major league roster for the first time since 2003 . He posted a 9 @.@ 26 ERA in his first 14 games of 2009 before getting sent to the minors for the rest of the season . In 2010 , he signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates but was traded to the San Francisco Giants during the season . He had his lowest ERA that year ( 2 @.@ 34 ) and won another World Series as the Giants defeated the Texas Rangers to win their first World Series since 1954 . In 2011 , López was one of two major league relief pitchers to throw at least 50 innings without giving up a home run . He won his third World Series in 2012 as the Giants defeated the Detroit Tigers in four games . In 2013 , López posted a career @-@ best 1 @.@ 83 ERA . He won his fourth World Series in 2014 as the Giants defeated the Kansas City Royals in seven games . As of 2014 , he is the only active player to have played on 4 or more World Series championship teams . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Although he was born in Puerto Rico , López grew up in Fairfax , Virginia . He and his wife , Renee , attended Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax , Virginia . Growing up , his dream was to be an FBI agent like his father . 
 López went to college at the University of Virginia ( UVA ) and played for the Virginia Cavaliers baseball team . Through August 2011 , he was one of 29 former UVA players to have made it to the major leagues , along with among others Mark Reynolds , and Ryan Zimmerman . While playing at UVA , he went 12 – 9 with a 6 @.@ 30 earned run average ( ERA ) . As a hitter , he had a batting average of .319 , 15 home runs , and 71 runs batted in ( RBI ) . However , while still at UVA , he discovered that pitching was most likely to get him to the major leagues . Despite leaving college after only three years to play professional baseball , López continued working on his degree in psychology , which he earned in 2002 to fulfill a promise to his father @-@ in @-@ law . He also said , " I had done three years at a great university . I figured I should finish . "

 After three seasons at UVA , López was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the fourth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball ( MLB ) Draft . He began his minor league career as a starting pitcher for the South Bend Silver Hawks of the A Midwest League . In 16 games ( 19 starts ) , he had a 2 – 4 record , a 6 @.@ 55 ERA , 31 strikeouts , and 30 walks in 44 innings pitched . He remained at South Bend in 1999 , posting a 4 – 6 record , a 6 @.@ 00 ERA , and 70 strikeouts over 99 innings pitched in 20 starts . In 2000 , López was promoted to the High Desert Mavericks of the A @-@ Advanced California League . In 30 games ( 21 starts ) , he had a 4 – 8 record , a 5 @.@ 22 ERA , 98 strikeouts , and two saves in 136 1 ⁄ 3 innings . 
 In 2001 , deciding that he would not be able to reach the major leagues as a starter , López converted to a submariner and moved to the bullpen . He said , " I don 't know if that was desperation as much as it was admitting failure . " He began the season with Arizona 's A @-@ Advanced affiliate , which was now the Lancaster <unk> . In 17 games , he had a 1 – 3 record , a 2 @.@ 62 ERA , 18 strikeouts , and one save in 24 innings pitched .

López made the roster and made his MLB debut for the Rockies on Opening Day in 2003 , pitching a scoreless inning in a 10 – 4 loss to the Houston Astros . He got his first major league strikeout in his next game on April 5 , punching out Tony Womack in a 4 – 3 victory over the Diamondbacks . On April 10 , he got his first win , pitching 2 ⁄ 3 scoreless innings in a 7 – 6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals . He posted an 0 @.@ 72 ERA , which led all NL relievers , in his first 30 games through June 8 , posting an 18 2 ⁄ 3 innings scoreless streak at the end of that run . However , his ERA jumped up to 3 @.@ 16 on June 12 , when he allowed seven runs in 2 ⁄ 3 of an inning in a 15 – 3 loss to the Minnesota Twins . From July 31 through August 16 , López almost tied a franchise record by retiring 18 straight hitters over the span of 17 days , but he fell short of the record of 21 set by Darren Holmes in 1996 when he intentionally walked Jason Phillips in a 13 – 4 loss to the New York Mets . On August 12 , he recorded his first career save by pitching a scoreless 11th inning in a 6 – 3 victory over the Montreal Expos .

 = Domitian = 
 Domitian ( / <unk> , <unk> / ; Latin : Titus Flavius Caesar Domitianus Augustus ; 24 October 51 – 18 September 96 ) was Roman emperor from 81 to 96 . Domitian was the third and last emperor of the Flavian dynasty . 
 Domitian 's youth and early career were largely spent in the shadow of his brother Titus , who gained military renown during the First Jewish – Roman War . This situation continued under the rule of his father Vespasian , who became emperor in 69 following the civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors . While Titus held a great many offices under the rule of his father , Domitian was left with honours but no responsibilities . Vespasian died in 79 and was succeeded by Titus , whose own reign came to an unexpected end when he was struck by a fatal illness in 81 . The following day Domitian was declared Emperor by the Praetorian Guard , commencing a reign that lasted fifteen years – longer than any man who had ruled since Tiberius . 
 As Emperor , Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage , expanded the border defenses of the Empire , and initiated a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome . Significant wars were fought in Britain , where his general Agricola attempted to conquer Caledonia ( Scotland ) , and in Dacia , where Domitian was unable to procure a decisive victory against king Decebalus . Domitian 's government exhibited totalitarian characteristics ; he saw himself as the new Augustus , an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new era of brilliance . Religious , military , and cultural propaganda fostered a cult of personality , and by nominating himself perpetual censor , he sought to control public and private morals . As a consequence , Domitian was popular with the people and army but considered a tyrant by members of the Roman Senate . 
 Domitian 's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials . The same day he was succeeded by his advisor Nerva . After his death , Domitian 's memory was condemned to oblivion by the Roman Senate , while senatorial authors such as Tacitus , Pliny the Younger and Suetonius published histories propagating the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant . Modern revisionists have instead characterized Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural , economic and political program provided the foundation of the peaceful 2nd century . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Family = = = 
 Domitian was born in Rome on 24 October 51 , the youngest son of Titus Flavius Vespasianus — commonly known as Vespasian — and Flavia Domitilla Major . He had an older sister , Domitilla the Younger , and brother , also named Titus Flavius Vespasianus . 
 Decades of civil war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly to the demise of the old aristocracy of Rome , which a new Italian nobility gradually replaced in prominence during the early part of the 1st century . One such family , the Flavians , or gens Flavia , rose from relative obscurity to prominence in just four generations , acquiring wealth and status under the emperors of the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty . Domitian 's great @-@ grandfather , Titus Flavius Petro , had served as a centurion under Pompey during Caesar 's civil war . His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC . 
 Nevertheless , Petro managed to improve his status by marrying the extremely wealthy Tertulla , whose fortune guaranteed the upwards mobility of Petro 's son Titus Flavius Sabinus I , Domitian 's grandfather . Sabinus himself amassed further wealth and possible equestrian status through his services as tax collector in Asia and banker in Helvetia ( modern Switzerland ) . By marrying Vespasia Polla he allied the Flavian family to the more prestigious gens Vespasia , ensuring the elevation of his sons Titus Flavius Sabinus II and Vespasian to senatorial rank . 
 The political career of Vespasian included the offices of quaestor , aedile , and praetor , and culminated with a consulship in 51 , the year of Domitian 's birth . As a military commander , Vespasian gained early renown by participating in the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 . Nevertheless , ancient sources allege poverty for the Flavian family at the time of Domitian 's upbringing , even claiming Vespasian had fallen into disrepute under the emperors Caligula ( 37 – 41 ) and Nero ( 54 – 68 ) . Modern history has refuted these claims , suggesting these stories later circulated under Flavian rule as part of a propaganda campaign to diminish success under the less reputable Emperors of the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty and to maximize achievements under Emperor Claudius ( 41 – 54 ) and his son Britannicus . 
 By all appearances , the Flavians enjoyed high imperial favour throughout the 40s and 60s . While Titus received a court education in the company of Britannicus , Vespasian pursued a successful political and military career . Following a prolonged period of retirement during the 50s , he returned to public office under Nero , serving as proconsul of the Africa province in 63 , and accompanying the emperor during an official tour of Greece in 66 . 
 The same year the Jews of the Judaea province revolted against the Roman Empire in what is now known as the First Jewish @-@ Roman War . Vespasian was assigned to lead the Roman army against the insurgents , with Titus — who had completed his military education by this time — in charge of a legion . 
 = = = Youth and character = = = 
 By the time he was 6 years old , Domitian 's mother and sister had long since died , while his father and brother were continuously active in the Roman military , commanding armies in Germania and Judaea . For Domitian , this meant that a significant part of his adolescence was spent in the absence of his near relatives . During the Jewish @-@ Roman wars , he was likely taken under the care of his uncle Titus Flavius Sabinus II , at the time serving as city prefect of Rome ; or possibly even Marcus Cocceius Nerva , a loyal friend of the Flavians and the future successor to Domitian . 
 He received the education of a young man of the privileged senatorial class , studying rhetoric and literature . In his biography in the Lives of the Twelve Caesars , Suetonius attests to Domitian 's ability to quote the important poets and writers such as Homer or Virgil on appropriate occasions , and describes him as a learned and educated adolescent , with elegant conversation . Among his first published works were poetry , as well as writings on law and administration . 
 Unlike his brother Titus , Domitian was not educated at court . Whether he received formal military training is not recorded , but according to Suetonius , he displayed considerable marksmanship with the bow and arrow . A detailed description of Domitian 's appearance and character is provided by Suetonius , who devotes a substantial part of his biography to his personality . 
 He was tall of stature , with a modest expression and a high colour . His eyes were large , but his sight was somewhat dim . He was handsome and graceful too , especially when a young man , and indeed in his whole body with the exception of his feet , the toes of which were somewhat cramped . In later life he had the further disfigurement of baldness , a protruding belly , and <unk> legs , though the latter had become thin from a long illness . 
 Suetonius , De Vita Caesarum , " Life of Domitian " , 18 
 Domitian was allegedly extremely sensitive regarding his baldness , which he disguised in later life by wearing wigs . According to Suetonius , he even wrote a book on the subject of hair care . With regard to Domitian 's personality , however , the account of Suetonius alternates sharply between portraying Domitian as the emperor @-@ tyrant , a man both physically and intellectually lazy , and the intelligent , refined personality drawn elsewhere . 
 Historian Brian Jones concludes in The Emperor Domitian that assessing the true nature of Domitian 's personality is inherently complicated by the bias of the surviving sources . Common threads nonetheless emerge from the available evidence . He appears to have lacked the natural charisma of his brother and father . He was prone to suspicion , displayed an odd , sometimes self @-@ deprecating sense of humour , and often communicated in cryptic ways . 
 This ambiguity of character was further exacerbated by his remoteness , and as he grew older , he increasingly displayed a preference for solitude , which may have stemmed from his isolated upbringing . Indeed , by the age of eighteen nearly all of his closest relatives had died by war or disease . Having spent the greater part of his early life in the twilight of Nero 's reign , his formative years would have been strongly influenced by the political turmoil of the 60s , culminating with the civil war of 69 , which brought his family to power . 
 = = Rise of the Flavian dynasty = = 
 = = = Year of the Four Emperors = = = 
 On 9 June 68 , amid growing opposition of the Senate and the army , Nero committed suicide and with him the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty came to an end . Chaos ensued , leading to a year of brutal civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors , during which the four most influential generals in the Roman Empire — Galba , Otho , Vitellius and Vespasian — successively vied for imperial power . 
 News of Nero 's death reached Vespasian as he was preparing to besiege the city of Jerusalem . Almost simultaneously the Senate had declared Galba , then governor of Hispania Tarraconensis ( modern northern Spain ) , as Emperor of Rome . Rather than continue his campaign , Vespasian decided to await further orders and send Titus to greet the new Emperor . 
 Before reaching Italy , Titus learnt that Galba had been murdered and replaced by Otho , the governor of Lusitania ( modern Portugal ) . At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome , intent on overthrowing Otho . Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one side or the other , Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea . 
 Otho and Vitellius realized the potential threat posed by the Flavian faction . With four legions at his disposal , Vespasian commanded a strength of nearly 80 @,@ 000 soldiers . His position in Judaea further granted him the advantage of being nearest to the vital province of Egypt , which controlled the grain supply to Rome . His brother Titus Flavius Sabinus II , as city prefect , commanded the entire city garrison of Rome . Tensions among the Flavian troops ran high but so long as either Galba or Otho remained in power , Vespasian refused to take action . 
 When Otho was defeated by Vitellius at the First Battle of Bedriacum , the armies in Judaea and Egypt took matters into their own hands and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69 . Vespasian accepted and entered an alliance with Gaius Licinius Mucianus , the governor of Syria , against Vitellius . A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus , while Vespasian travelled to Alexandria , leaving Titus in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion . 
 In Rome , Domitian was placed under house arrest by Vitellius , as a safeguard against Flavian aggression . Support for the old emperor waned as more legions around the empire pledged their allegiance to Vespasian . On 24 October 69 , the forces of Vitellius and Vespasian met at the Second Battle of Bedriacum , which ended in a crushing defeat for the armies of Vitellius . 
 In despair , Vitellius attempted to negotiate a surrender . Terms of peace , including a voluntary abdication , were agreed upon with Titus Flavius Sabinus II but the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard — the imperial bodyguard — considered such a resignation disgraceful and prevented Vitellius from carrying out the treaty . On the morning of 18 December , the emperor appeared to deposit the imperial insignia at the Temple of Concord but at the last minute retraced his steps to the Imperial palace . In the confusion , the leading men of the state gathered at Sabinus ' house , proclaiming Vespasian as Emperor , but the multitude dispersed when Vitellian cohorts clashed with the armed escort of Sabinus , who was forced to retreat to the Capitoline Hill . 
 During the night , he was joined by his relatives , including Domitian . The armies of Mucianus were nearing Rome but the besieged Flavian party did not hold out for longer than a day . On 19 December , <unk> burst onto the Capitol and in a skirmish , Sabinus was captured and executed . Domitian managed to escape by disguising himself as a worshipper of Isis and spent the night in safety with one of his father 's supporters , Cornelius Primus . 
 By the afternoon of 20 December , Vitellius was dead , his armies having been defeated by the Flavian legions . With nothing more to be feared , Domitian came forward to meet the invading forces ; he was universally saluted by the title of Caesar and the mass of troops conducted him to his father 's house . The following day , 21 December , the Senate proclaimed Vespasian emperor of the Roman Empire . 
 = = = Aftermath of the war = = = 
 Although the war had officially ended , a state of anarchy and lawlessness pervaded in the first days following the demise of Vitellius . Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70 but Vespasian did not enter Rome until September of that year . In the meantime , Domitian acted as the representative of the Flavian family in the Roman Senate . He received the title of Caesar and was appointed praetor with consular power . 
 The ancient historian Tacitus describes Domitian 's first speech in the Senate as brief and measured , at the same time noting his ability to elude awkward questions . Domitian 's authority was merely nominal , however , foreshadowing what was to be his role for at least ten more years . By all accounts , Mucianus held the real power in Vespasian 's absence and he was careful to ensure that Domitian , still only eighteen years old , did not overstep the boundaries of his function . Strict control was also maintained over the young Caesar 's entourage , promoting away Flavian generals such as Arrius Varus and Antonius Primus and replacing them by more reliable men such as Arrecinus Clemens . 
 Equally curtailed by Mucianus were Domitian 's military ambitions . The civil war of 69 had severely destabilized the provinces , leading to several local uprisings such as the Batavian revolt in Gaul . Batavian auxiliaries of the Rhine legions , led by Gaius Julius Civilis , had rebelled with the aid of a faction of <unk> under the command of Julius <unk> . Seven legions were sent from Rome , led by Vespasian 's brother @-@ in @-@ law Quintus Petillius Cerialis . 
 Although the revolt was quickly suppressed , exaggerated reports of disaster prompted Mucianus to depart the capital with reinforcements of his own . Domitian eagerly sought the opportunity to attain military glory and joined the other officers with the intention of commanding a legion of his own . According to Tacitus , Mucianus was not keen on this prospect but since he considered Domitian a liability in any capacity that was entrusted to him , he preferred to keep him close at hand rather than in Rome . 
 When news arrived of Cerialis ' victory over Civilis , Mucianus tactfully dissuaded Domitian from pursuing further military endeavours . Domitian then wrote to Cerialis personally , suggesting he hand over command of his army but , once again , he was snubbed . With the return of Vespasian in late September , his political role was rendered all but obsolete and Domitian withdrew from government devoting his time to arts and literature . 
 = = = Marriage = = = 
 Where his political and military career had ended in disappointment , Domitian 's private affairs were more successful . In 70 Vespasian attempted to arrange a dynastic marriage between his youngest son and the daughter of Titus , Julia Flavia , but Domitian was adamant in his love for Domitia Longina , going so far as to persuade her husband , Lucius Aelius Lamia , to divorce her so that Domitian could marry her himself . Despite its initial recklessness , the alliance was very prestigious for both families . Domitia Longina was the younger daughter of Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo , a respected general and honoured politician who had distinguished himself for his leadership in Armenia . Following the failed Pisonian conspiracy against Nero in 65 , he had been forced to commit suicide . The new marriage not only re @-@ established ties to senatorial opposition , but also served the broader Flavian propaganda of the time , which sought to diminish Vespasian 's political success under Nero . Instead connections to Claudius and Britannicus were emphasised , and Nero 's victims , or those otherwise disadvantaged by him , rehabilitated . 
 In 80 , Domitia and Domitian 's only attested son was born . It is not known what the boy 's name was , but he died in childhood in 83 . Shortly following his accession as Emperor , Domitian bestowed the honorific title of Augusta upon Domitia , while their son was deified , appearing as such on the reverse of coin types from this period . Nevertheless , the marriage appears to have faced a significant crisis in 83 . For reasons unknown , Domitian briefly exiled Domitia , and then soon recalled her , either out of love or due to rumours that he was carrying on a relationship with his niece Julia Flavia . Jones argues that most likely he did so for her failure to produce an heir . By 84 , Domitia had returned to the palace , where she lived for the remainder of Domitian 's reign without incident . Little is known of Domitia 's activities as Empress , or how much influence she wielded in Domitian 's government , but it seems her role was limited . From Suetonius , we know that she at least accompanied the Emperor to the amphitheatre , while the Jewish writer Josephus speaks of benefits he received from her . It is not known whether Domitian had other children , but he did not marry again . Despite allegations by Roman sources of adultery and divorce , the marriage appears to have been happy . 
 = = = Ceremonial heir ( 71 – 81 ) = = = 
 Prior to becoming Emperor , Domitian 's role in the Flavian government was largely ceremonial . In June 71 , Titus returned triumphant from the war in Judaea . Ultimately , the rebellion had claimed the lives of over 1 million people , a majority of whom were Jewish . The city and temple of Jerusalem were completely destroyed , its most valuable treasures carried off by the Roman army , and nearly 100 @,@ 000 people were captured and enslaved . 
 For his victory , the Senate awarded Titus a Roman triumph . On the day of the festivities , the Flavian family rode into the capital , preceded by a lavish parade that displayed the spoils of the war . The family procession was headed by Vespasian and Titus , while Domitian , riding a magnificent white horse , followed with the remaining Flavian relatives . 
 Leaders of the Jewish resistance were executed in the Forum Romanum , after which the procession closed with religious sacrifices at the Temple of Jupiter . A triumphal arch , the Arch of Titus , was erected at the south @-@ east entrance to the Forum to commemorate the successful end of the war . 
 Yet the return of Titus further highlighted the comparative insignificance of Domitian , both militarily and politically . As the eldest and most experienced of Vespasian 's sons , Titus shared tribunician power with his father , received seven consulships , the censorship , and was given command of the Praetorian Guard ; powers that left no doubt he was the designated heir to the Empire . As a second son , Domitian held honorary titles , such as Caesar or Princeps <unk> , and several priesthoods , including those of augur , pontifex , frater arvalis , magister frater <unk> , and <unk> <unk> omnium , but no office with imperium . 
 He held six consulships during Vespasian 's reign but only one of these , in 73 , was an ordinary consulship . The other five were less prestigious suffect consulships , which he held in 71 , 75 , 76 , 77 and 79 respectively , usually replacing his father or brother in mid @-@ January . While ceremonial , these offices no doubt gained Domitian valuable experience in the Roman Senate , and may have contributed to his later reservations about its relevance . 
 Under Vespasian and Titus , non @-@ Flavians were virtually excluded from the important public offices . Mucianus himself all but disappeared from historical records during this time , and it is believed he died sometime between 75 and 77 . Real power was unmistakably concentrated in the hands of the Flavian faction ; the weakened Senate only maintained the facade of democracy . 
 Because Titus effectively acted as co @-@ emperor with his father , no abrupt change in Flavian policy occurred when Vespasian died on 23 June 79 . Titus assured Domitian that full partnership in the government would soon be his , but neither tribunician power nor imperium of any kind was conferred upon him during Titus ' brief reign . The new Emperor was not eager to alter this arrangement : he was under forty and at the height of his power . 
 Two major disasters struck during 79 and 80 . On 24 August 79 , Mount Vesuvius erupted , burying the surrounding cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum under metres of ash and lava ; the following year , a fire broke out in Rome that lasted three days and that destroyed a number of important public buildings . Consequently , Titus spent much of his reign coordinating relief efforts and restoring damaged property . On 13 September 81 after barely two years in office , he unexpectedly died of fever during a trip to the Sabine territories . 
 Ancient authors have implicated Domitian in the death of his brother , either by directly accusing him of murder , or implying he left the ailing Titus for dead , even alleging that during his lifetime , Domitian was openly plotting against his brother . It is difficult to assess the factual veracity of these statements given the known bias of the surviving sources . Brotherly affection was likely at a minimum , but this was hardly surprising , considering that Domitian had barely seen Titus after the age of seven . 
 Whatever the nature of their relationship , Domitian seems to have displayed little sympathy when his brother lay dying , instead making for the Praetorian camp where he was proclaimed emperor . The following day , 14 September , the Senate confirmed Domitian 's powers , granting tribunician power , the office of Pontifex Maximus , and the titles of Augustus , and Pater Patriae . 
 = = Emperor ( 81 – 96 ) = = 
 = = = Rule = = = 
 As Emperor , Domitian quickly dispensed with the republican facade his father and brother had maintained during their reign . By moving the centre of government ( more or less formally ) to the imperial court , Domitian openly rendered the Senate 's powers obsolete . In his view , the Roman Empire was to be governed as a divine monarchy with himself as the benevolent despot at its head . 
 In addition to exercising absolute political power , Domitian believed the Emperor 's role encompassed every aspect of daily life , guiding the Roman people as a cultural and moral authority . To usher in the new era , he embarked on ambitious economic , military and cultural programs with the intention of restoring the Empire to the splendour it had seen under the Emperor Augustus . 
 Despite these grand designs Domitian was determined to govern the Empire conscientiously and scrupulously . He became personally involved in all branches of the administration : edicts were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law , while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced . According to Suetonius , the imperial bureaucracy never ran more efficiently than under Domitian , whose exacting standards and suspicious nature maintained historically low corruption among provincial governors and elected officials . 
 Although he made no pretence regarding the significance of the Senate under his absolute rule , those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate , and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members ; a policy that stood in contrast to the nepotism practiced by Vespasian and Titus . Above all , however , Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts , qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family , whom he regarded with suspicion , and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy . 
 The reality of Domitian 's autocracy was further highlighted by the fact that , more than any emperor since Tiberius , he spent significant periods of time away from the capital . Although the Senate 's power had been in decline since the fall of the Republic , under Domitian the seat of power was no longer even in Rome , but rather wherever the Emperor was . Until the completion of the Flavian Palace on the Palatine Hill , the imperial court was situated at Alba or <unk> , and sometimes even farther afield . Domitian toured the European provinces extensively , and spent at least three years of his reign in Germania and Illyricum , conducting military campaigns on the frontiers of the Empire . 
 = = = Economy = = = 
 Domitian 's tendency towards micromanagement was nowhere more evident than in his financial policy . The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus at the time of his death has been fiercely debated . The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian 's reign . Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically . He increased the silver purity of the denarius from 90 % to 98 % — the actual silver weight increasing from 2 @.@ 87 grams to 3 @.@ 26 grams . A financial crisis in 85 forced a devaluation of the silver purity and weight to 93 @.@ 5 % and 3 @.@ 04 grams respectively . 
 Nevertheless , the new values were still higher than the levels that Vespasian and Titus had maintained during their reigns . Domitian 's rigorous taxation policy ensured that this standard was sustained for the following eleven years . Coinage from this era displays a highly consistent degree of quality including meticulous attention to Domitian 's titulature and refined artwork on the reverse portraits . 
 Jones estimates Domitian 's annual income at more than 1 @.@ 2 billion sestertii , of which over one @-@ third would presumably have been spent maintaining the Roman army . The other major expense was the extensive reconstruction of Rome . At the time of Domitian 's accession the city was still suffering from the damage caused by the Great Fire of 64 , the civil war of 69 and the fire in 79 . 
 Much more than a renovation project , Domitian 's building program was intended to be the crowning achievement of an Empire @-@ wide cultural renaissance . Around fifty structures were erected , restored or completed , achievements second only to those of Augustus . Among the most important new structures were an <unk> , a stadium , and an expansive palace on the Palatine Hill known as the Flavian Palace , which was designed by Domitian 's master architect <unk> . 
 The most important building Domitian restored was the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill , said to have been covered with a gilded roof . Among those completed were the Temple of Vespasian and Titus , the Arch of Titus and the Colosseum , to which he added a fourth level and finished the interior seating area . 
 In order to appease the people of Rome an estimated 135 million sestertii was spent on donatives , or <unk> , throughout Domitian 's reign . The Emperor also revived the practice of public banquets , which had been reduced to a simple distribution of food under Nero , while he invested large sums on entertainment and games . In 86 he founded the Capitoline Games , a quadrennial contest comprising athletic displays , chariot racing , and competitions for oratory , music and acting . 
 Domitian himself supported the travel of competitors from all corners of the Empire to Rome and distributed the prizes . Innovations were also introduced into the regular gladiatorial games such as naval contests , nighttime battles , and female and dwarf gladiator fights . Lastly , he added two new factions to the chariot races , Gold and Purple , to race against the existing White , Red , Green and Blue factions . 
 = = = Military campaigns = = = 
 The military campaigns undertaken during Domitian 's reign were generally defensive in nature , as the Emperor rejected the idea of expansionist warfare . His most significant military contribution was the development of the Limes Germanicus , which encompassed a vast network of roads , forts and watchtowers constructed along the Rhine river to defend the Empire . Nevertheless , several important wars were fought in Gaul , against the Chatti , and across the Danube frontier against the Suebi , the Sarmatians , and the Dacians . 
 The conquest of Britain continued under the command of Gnaeus Julius Agricola , who expanded the Roman Empire as far as Caledonia , or modern day Scotland . Domitian also founded a new legion in 82 , the Legio I Minervia , to fight against the Chatti . Domitian is also credited on the easternmost evidence of Roman presence , the rock inscription near <unk> mountain , in present @-@ day Azerbaijan . As judged by the carved titles of Caesar , Augustus and Germanicus , the related march took place between 84 and 96 AD . 
 Domitian 's administration of the Roman army was characterized by the same fastidious involvement he exhibited in other branches of the government . His competence as a military strategist was criticized by his contemporaries however . Although he claimed several triumphs , these were largely propaganda manoeuvres . Tacitus derided Domitian 's victory against the Chatti as a " mock triumph " , and criticized his decision to retreat in Britain following the conquests of Agricola . 
 Nevertheless , Domitian appears to have been very popular among the soldiers , spending an estimated three years of his reign among the army on campaigns — more than any emperor since Augustus — and raising their pay by one @-@ third . While the army command may have disapproved of his tactical and strategic decisions , the loyalty of the common soldier was unquestioned . 
 = = = = Campaign against the Chatti = = = = 
 Once Emperor , Domitian immediately sought to attain his long delayed military glory . As early as 82 , or possibly 83 , he went to Gaul , ostensibly to conduct a census , and suddenly ordered an attack on the Chatti . For this purpose , a new legion was founded , Legio I Minervia , which constructed some 75 kilometres ( 46 mi ) of roads through Chattan territory to uncover the enemy 's hiding places . 
 Although little information survives of the battles fought , enough early victories were apparently achieved for Domitian to be back in Rome by the end of 83 , where he celebrated an elaborate triumph and conferred upon himself the title of Germanicus . Domitian 's supposed victory was much scorned by ancient authors , who described the campaign as " uncalled for " , and a " mock triumph " . The evidence lends some credence to these claims , as the Chatti would later play a significant role during the revolt of Saturninus in 89 . 
 = = = = Conquest of Britain ( 77 – 84 ) = = = = 
 One of the most detailed reports of military activity under the Flavian dynasty was written by Tacitus , whose biography of his father @-@ in @-@ law Gnaeus Julius Agricola largely concerns the conquest of Britain between 77 and 84 . Agricola arrived c . 77 as governor of Roman Britain , immediately launching campaigns into Caledonia ( modern Scotland ) . 
 In 82 Agricola crossed an unidentified body of water and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then . He fortified the coast facing Ireland , and Tacitus recalls that his father @-@ in @-@ law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and a few auxiliaries . He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest . This conquest never happened , but some historians believe that the crossing referred to was in fact a small @-@ scale exploratory or punitive expedition to Ireland . 
 Turning his attention from Ireland , the following year Agricola raised a fleet and pushed beyond the Forth into Caledonia . To aid the advance , a large legionary fortress was constructed at Inchtuthil . In the summer of 84 , Agricola faced the armies of the Caledonians , led by Calgacus , at the Battle of Mons Graupius . Although the Romans inflicted heavy losses on the enemy , two @-@ thirds of the Caledonian army escaped and hid in the Scottish marshes and Highlands , ultimately preventing Agricola from bringing the entire British island under his control . 
 In 85 , Agricola was recalled to Rome by Domitian , having served for more than six years as governor , longer than normal for consular legates during the Flavian era . Tacitus claims that Domitian ordered his recall because Agricola 's successes outshone the Emperor 's own modest victories in Germania . The relationship between Agricola and the Emperor is unclear : on the one hand , Agricola was awarded triumphal decorations and a statue , on the other , Agricola never again held a civil or military post in spite of his experience and renown . He was offered the governorship of the province of Africa but declined it , either due to ill health or , as Tacitus claims , the machinations of Domitian . 
 Not long after Agricola 's recall from Britain , the Roman Empire entered into war with the Kingdom of Dacia in the East . Reinforcements were needed , and in 87 or 88 , Domitian ordered a large @-@ scale strategic withdrawal of troops in the British province . The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled and the Caledonian forts and watchtowers abandoned , moving the Roman frontier some 120 kilometres ( 75 mi ) further south . The army command may have resented Domitian 's decision to retreat , but to him the Caledonian territories never represented anything more than a loss to the Roman treasury . 
 = = = = Dacian wars ( 85 – 88 ) = = = = 
 The most significant threat the Roman Empire faced during the reign of Domitian arose from the northern provinces of Illyricum , where the Suebi , the Sarmatians and the Dacians continuously harassed Roman settlements along the Danube river . Of these , the Sarmatians and the Dacians posed the most formidable threat . In approximately 84 or 85 the Dacians , led by King Decebalus , crossed the Danube into the province of Moesia , wreaking havoc and killing the Moesian governor <unk> Sabinus . 
 Domitian quickly launched a counteroffensive , personally travelling to the region accompanied by a large force commanded by his praetorian prefect Cornelius Fuscus . Fuscus successfully drove the Dacians back across the border in mid @-@ 85 , prompting Domitian to return to Rome and celebrate his second triumph . 
 The victory proved short @-@ lived , however : as early in 86 Fuscus embarked on an ill @-@ fated expedition into Dacia , which resulted in the complete destruction of the fifth legion , Legio V <unk> , in the First Battle of Tapae . Fuscus was killed , and the battle standard of the Praetorian Guard was lost . The loss of the battle standard , or aquila , was indicative of a crushing defeat and a serious affront to Roman national pride . 
 Domitian returned to Moesia in August 86 . He divided the province into Lower Moesia and Upper Moesia , and transferred three additional legions to the Danube . In 87 , the Romans invaded Dacia once more , this time under the command of <unk> Julianus , and finally defeated Decebalus in late 88 at the same site where Fuscus had previously perished . An attack on the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa was forestalled when new troubles arose on the German frontier in 89 . 
 In order to avert having to conduct a war on two fronts , Domitian agreed to terms of peace with Decebalus , negotiating free access of Roman troops through the Dacian region while granting Decebalus an annual subsidy of 8 million sesterces . Contemporary authors severely criticized this treaty , which was considered shameful to the Romans and left the deaths of Sabinus and Fuscus <unk> . For the remainder of Domitian 's reign Dacia remained a relatively peaceful client kingdom , but Decebalus used the Roman money to fortify his defenses . 
 Domitian probably wanted a new war against the Dacians , and reinforced Upper Moesia with two more cavalry units brought from Syria and with at least five cohorts brought from Pannonia . Trajan continued Domitian 's policy and added two more units to the auxiliary forces of Upper Moesia , and then he used the build up of troops for his Dacian wars . Eventually the Romans achieved a decisive victory against Decebalus in 106 . Again , the Roman army sustained heavy losses , but Trajan succeeded in capturing Sarmizegetusa and , importantly , annexed the Dacian gold and silver mines . 
 = = = Religious policy = = = 
 Domitian firmly believed in the traditional Roman religion , and personally saw to it that ancient customs and morals were observed throughout his reign . In order to justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule , Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity Jupiter , perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill . A small chapel dedicated to Jupiter Conservator was also constructed near the house where Domitian had fled to safety on 20 December 69 . Later in his reign , he replaced it with a more expansive building , dedicated to Jupiter Custos . 
 The goddess he worshipped the most zealously , however , was Minerva . Not only did he keep a personal shrine dedicated to her in his bedroom , she regularly appeared on his coinage — in four different attested reverse types — and he founded a legion , Legio I Minervia , in her name . 
 Domitian also revived the practice of the imperial cult , which had fallen somewhat out of use under Vespasian . Significantly , his first act as an Emperor was the deification of his brother Titus . Upon their deaths , his infant son , and niece , Julia Flavia , were likewise enrolled among the gods . With regards to the emperor himself as a religious figure , both Suetonius and Cassius Dio allege that Domitian officially gave himself the title of Dominus et Deus . However , not only did he reject the title of Dominus during his reign , but since he issued no official documentation or coinage to this effect , historians such as Brian Jones contend that such phrases were addressed to Domitian by flatterers who wished to earn favors from the emperor . 
 To foster the worship of the imperial family , he erected a dynastic mausoleum on the site of Vespasian 's former house on the Quirinal , and completed the Temple of Vespasian and Titus , a shrine dedicated to the worship of his deified father and brother . To memorialize the military triumphs of the Flavian family , he ordered the construction of the Templum <unk> and the Templum Fortuna Redux , and completed the Arch of Titus . 
 Construction projects such as these constituted only the most visible part of Domitian 's religious policy , which also concerned itself with the fulfilment of religious law and public morals . In 85 , he nominated himself perpetual censor , the office that held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct . Once again , Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully , and with care . He renewed the Lex Iulia de <unk> <unk> , under which adultery was punishable by exile . From the list of jurors he struck an equestrian who had divorced his wife and taken her back , while an ex @-@ quaestor was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing . 
 Domitian also heavily prosecuted corruption among public officials , removing jurors if they accepted bribes and rescinding legislation when a conflict of interest was suspected . He ensured that libellous writings , especially those directed against himself , were punishable by exile or death . Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion , as their performances provided an opportunity for satire at the expense of the government . Consequently , he forbade mimes from appearing on stage in public . 
 In 87 , Vestal Virgins were found to have broken their sacred vows of lifelong public chastity . As the Vestals were regarded as daughters of the community , this offense essentially constituted incest . Accordingly , those found guilty of any such transgression were condemned to death , either by a manner of their choosing , or according to the ancient fashion , which dictated that Vestals should be buried alive . 
 Foreign religions were tolerated insofar as they did not interfere with public order , or could be assimilated with the traditional Roman religion . The worship of Egyptian deities in particular flourished under the Flavian dynasty , to an extent not seen again until the reign of Commodus . Veneration of Serapis and Isis , who were identified with Jupiter and Minerva respectively , was especially prominent . 
 4th century writings by Eusebius of Caesarea maintain that Jews and Christians were heavily persecuted toward the end of Domitian 's reign . The Book of Revelation is thought by some to have been written during this period . Although Jews were heavily taxed , no contemporary authors mention trials or executions based on religious offenses other than those within the Roman religion . 
 = = = Opposition = = = 
 = = = = Revolt of Governor Saturninus ( 89 ) = = = = 
 On 1 January 89 , the governor of Germania Superior , Lucius Antonius Saturninus , and his two legions at Mainz , Legio XIV Gemina and Legio XXI <unk> , revolted against the Roman Empire with the aid of the Germanic Chatti people . The precise cause for the rebellion is uncertain , although it appears to have been planned well in advance . The Senatorial officers may have disapproved of Domitian 's military strategies , such as his decision to fortify the German frontier rather than attack , as well as his recent retreat from Britain , and finally the disgraceful policy of appeasement towards Decebalus . 
 At any rate , the uprising was strictly confined to Saturninus ' province , and quickly detected once the rumour spread across the neighbouring provinces . The governor of Germania Inferior , Lappius Maximus , moved to the region at once , assisted by the procurator of Rhaetia , Titus Flavius Norbanus . From Spain , Trajan was summoned , while Domitian himself came from Rome with the Praetorian Guard . 
 By a stroke of luck , a thaw prevented the Chatti from crossing the Rhine and coming to Saturninus ' aid . Within twenty @-@ four days the rebellion was crushed , and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished . The mutinous legions were sent to the front in Illyricum , while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded . 
 Lappius Maximus received the governorship of the province of Syria , a consulship in May 95 , and finally a priesthood , which he still held in 102 . Titus Flavius Norbanus may have been appointed to the prefecture of Egypt , but almost certainly became prefect of the Praetorian Guard by 94 , with Titus Petronius Secundus as his colleague . Domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with Marcus Cocceius Nerva , suggesting the latter had played a part in uncovering the conspiracy , perhaps in a fashion similar to the one he played during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero . 
 Although little is known about the life and career of Nerva before his accession as Emperor in 96 , he appears to have been a highly adaptable diplomat , surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians ' most trusted advisors . His consulship may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and status quo of the regime . The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order . 
 = = = = Relationship with the Senate = = = = 
 Since the fall of the Republic , the authority of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi @-@ monarchical system of government established by Augustus , known as the Principate . The Principate allowed the existence of a de facto dictatorial regime , while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic . Most Emperors upheld the public facade of democracy , and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor 's status as a de facto monarch . 
 Some rulers handled this arrangement with less subtlety than others . Domitian was not so subtle . From the outset of his reign , he stressed the reality of his autocracy . He disliked aristocrats and had no fear of showing it , withdrawing every decision @-@ making power from the Senate , and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state . 
 The dislike was mutual . After Domitian 's assassination , the senators of Rome rushed to the Senate house , where they immediately passed a motion condemning his memory to oblivion . Under the rulers of the Nervan @-@ Antonian dynasty , senatorial authors published histories that elaborated on the view of Domitian as a tyrant . 
 Nevertheless , the evidence suggests that Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion . Whereas his father and brother had concentrated consular power largely in the hands of the Flavian family , Domitian admitted a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship , allowing them to head the official calendar by opening the year as an ordinary consul . Whether this was a genuine attempt to reconcile with hostile factions in the Senate cannot be ascertained . By offering the consulship to potential opponents , Domitian may have wanted to compromise these senators in the eyes of their supporters . When their conduct proved unsatisfactory , they were almost invariably brought to trial and exiled or executed , and their property was confiscated . 
 Both Tacitus and Suetonius speak of escalating persecutions toward the end of Domitian 's reign , identifying a point of sharp increase around 93 , or sometime after the failed revolt of Saturninus in 89 . At least twenty senatorial opponents were executed , including Domitia Longina 's former husband Lucius Aelius Lamia and three of Domitian 's own family members , Titus Flavius Sabinus IV , Titus Flavius Clemens and Marcus Arrecinus Clemens . Some of these men were executed as early as 83 or 85 however , lending little credit to Tacitus ' notion of a " reign of terror " late in Domitian 's reign . According to Suetonius , some were convicted for corruption or treason , others on trivial charges , which Domitian justified through his suspicion : 
 He used to say that the lot of Emperors was most unfortunate , since when they discovered a conspiracy , no one believed them unless they had been murdered . 
 Suetonius , De Vita Caesarum , " Life of Domitian " , 21 
 Jones compares the executions of Domitian to those under Emperor Claudius ( 41 – 55 ) , noting that Claudius executed around 35 senators and 300 equestrians , and yet was still deified by the Senate and regarded as one of the good Emperors of history . Domitian was apparently unable to gain support among the aristocracy , despite attempts to appease hostile factions with consular appointments . His autocratic style of government accentuated the Senate 's loss of power , while his policy of treating patricians and even family members as equals to all Romans earned him their contempt . 
 = = Death and succession = = 
 = = = Assassination ( 96 ) = = = 
 Domitian was assassinated on 18 September 96 , in a palace conspiracy organized by court officials . A highly detailed account of the plot and the assassination is provided by Suetonius , who alleges that Domitian 's chamberlain Parthenius was the chief instigator behind the conspiracy , citing the recent execution of Domitian 's secretary <unk> as the primary motive . The murder itself was carried out by a freedman of Parthenius named Maximus , and a steward of Domitian 's niece Flavia Domitilla , named Stephanus . 
 The precise involvement of the Praetorian Guard is less clear . At the time the Guard was commanded by Titus Flavius Norbanus and Titus Petronius Secundus and the latter was almost certainly aware of the plot . Cassius Dio , writing nearly a hundred years after the assassination , includes Domitia Longina among the conspirators , but in light of her attested devotion to Domitian — even years after her husband had died — her involvement in the plot seems highly unlikely . 
 Dio further suggests that the assassination was improvised , while Suetonius implies a well @-@ organized conspiracy . For some days before the attack took place , Stephanus feigned an injury so as to be able to conceal a dagger beneath his bandages . On the day of the assassination the doors to the servants ' quarters were locked while Domitian 's personal weapon of last resort , a sword he concealed beneath his pillow , had been removed in advance . 
 In accordance with an astrological prediction the Emperor believed that he would die around noon , and was therefore restless during this time of the day . On his last day , Domitian was feeling disturbed and asked a servant several times what time it was . The boy , included in the plot , lied , saying that it was much later than noon . More at ease , the Emperor went to his desk to sign some decrees , where he was suddenly approached by Stephanus : 
 Then pretending to betray a conspiracy and for that reason being given an audience , [ Stephanus ] stabbed the emperor in the groin as he was reading a paper which the assassin handed him , and stood in a state of amazement . As the wounded prince attempted to resist , he was slain with seven wounds by <unk> , a subaltern , Maximus , a freedman of Parthenius , <unk> , <unk> of the chamberlains , and a gladiator from the imperial school . 
 Suetonius , De Vita Caesarum , " Life of Domitian " , 17 
 Domitian and Stephanus wrestled on the ground for some time , until the Emperor was finally overpowered and fatally stabbed by the conspirators ; Stephanus was stabbed by Domitian during the struggle and died shortly afterward . Around noon Domitian , just one month short of his 45th birthday , was dead . His body was carried away on a common bier , and unceremoniously cremated by his nurse Phyllis , who later mingled the ashes with those of his niece Julia , at the Flavian temple . 
 According to Suetonius , a number of omens had foretold Domitian 's death . Several days prior to the assassination , Minerva had appeared to him in a dream , announcing she had been disarmed by Jupiter and would no longer be able to protect him . 
 = = = Succession and aftermath = = = 
 The Fasti <unk> , the <unk> Calendar , records that the same day the Senate proclaimed Marcus Cocceius Nerva emperor . Despite his political experience , this was a remarkable choice . Nerva was old and childless , and had spent much of his career out of the public light , prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in Domitian 's assassination . 
 According to Cassius Dio , the conspirators approached Nerva as a potential successor prior to the assassination , suggesting that he was at least aware of the plot . He does not appear in Suetonius ' version of the events , but this may be understandable , since his works were published under Nerva 's direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian . To suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder would have been less than sensitive . 
 On the other hand , Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire , and as a known Flavian loyalist , his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators . The precise facts have been obscured by history , but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate , within hours after the news of the assassination broke . The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war , but neither appears to have been involved in the conspiracy . 
 The Senate nonetheless rejoiced at the death of Domitian , and immediately following Nerva 's accession as Emperor , passed damnatio memoriae on his memory : his coins and statues were melted , his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records . Domitian and , over a century later Publius Septimius <unk> , were the only emperors known to have officially received a damnatio memoriae , though others may have received de facto ones . In many instances , existing portraits of Domitian , such as those found on the <unk> Reliefs , were simply recarved to fit the likeness of Nerva , which allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material . Yet the order of the Senate was only partially executed in Rome , and wholly disregarded in most of the provinces outside Italy . 
 According to Suetonius , the people of Rome met the news of Domitian 's death with indifference , but the army was much grieved , calling for his deification immediately after the assassination , and in several provinces rioting . As a compensation measure , the Praetorian Guard demanded the execution of Domitian 's assassins , which Nerva refused . Instead he merely dismissed Titus Petronius Secundus , and replaced him with a former commander , Casperius Aelianus . 
 Dissatisfaction with this state of affairs continued to loom over Nerva 's reign , and ultimately erupted into a crisis in October 97 , when members of the Praetorian Guard , led by Casperius Aelianus , laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage . He was forced to submit to their demands , agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian 's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians . Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius were sought out and killed . Nerva was unharmed in this assault , but his authority was damaged beyond repair . Shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor , and with this decision all but abdicated . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 = = = Ancient sources = = = 
 The classic view of Domitian is usually negative , since most of the antique sources were related to the Senatorial or aristocratic class , with which Domitian had notoriously difficult relations . Furthermore , contemporary historians such as Pliny the Younger , Tacitus and Suetonius all wrote down the information on his reign after it had ended , and his memory had been condemned to oblivion . The work of Domitian 's court poets Martial and Statius constitutes virtually the only literary evidence concurrent with his reign . Perhaps as unsurprising as the attitude of post @-@ Domitianic historians , the poems of Martial and Statius are highly adulatory , praising Domitian 's achievements as equalling those of the gods . 
 The most extensive account of the life of Domitian to survive was written by the historian Suetonius , who was born during the reign of Vespasian , and published his works under Emperor Hadrian ( 117 – 138 ) . His De Vita Caesarum is the source of much of what is known of Domitian . Although his text is predominantly negative , it neither exclusively condemns nor praises Domitian , and asserts that his rule started well , but gradually declined into terror . The biography is problematic however , in that it appears to contradict itself with regards to Domitian 's rule and personality , at the same time presenting him as a conscientious , moderate man , and as a decadent libertine . 
 According to Suetonius , Domitian wholly feigned his interest in arts and literature , and never bothered to acquaint himself with classic authors . Other passages , alluding to Domitian 's love of epigrammatic expression , suggest that he was in fact familiar with classic writers , while he also patronized poets and architects , founded artistic Olympics , and personally restored the library of Rome at great expense after it had burned down . 
 De Vita Caesarum is also the source of several outrageous stories regarding Domitian 's marriage life . According to Suetonius , Domitia Longina was exiled in 83 because of an affair with a famous actor named Paris . When Domitian found out , he allegedly murdered Paris in the street and promptly divorced his wife , with Suetonius further adding that once Domitia was exiled , Domitian took Julia as his mistress , who later died during a failed abortion . 
 Modern historians consider this highly implausible however , noting that malicious rumours such as those concerning Domitia 's alleged infidelity were eagerly repeated by post @-@ Domitianic authors , and used to highlight the hypocrisy of a ruler publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals , while privately indulging in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court . Nevertheless , the account of Suetonius has dominated imperial historiography for centuries . 
 Although Tacitus is usually considered to be the most reliable author of this era , his views on Domitian are complicated by the fact that his father @-@ in @-@ law , Gnaeus Julius Agricola , may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor . In his biographical work Agricola , Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian 's own inadequacy as a military commander . Several modern authors such as <unk> have argued the opposite : that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian , and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power . 
 Tacitus ' major historical works , including The Histories and Agricola 's biography , were all written and published under Domitian 's successors Nerva ( 96 – 98 ) and Trajan ( 98 – 117 ) . Unfortunately , the part of Tacitus ' Histories dealing with the reign of the Flavian dynasty is almost entirely lost . His views on Domitian survive through brief comments in its first five books , and the short but highly negative characterization in Agricola in which he severely criticizes Domitian 's military endeavours . Nevertheless , Tacitus admits his debt to the Flavians with regard to his own public career . 
 Other influential 2nd century authors include Juvenal and Pliny the Younger , the latter of whom was a friend of Tacitus and in 100 delivered his famous <unk> <unk> before Trajan and the Roman Senate , exalting the new era of restored freedom while condemning Domitian as a tyrant . Juvenal savagely satirized the Domitianic court in his Satires , depicting the Emperor and his entourage as corrupt , violent and unjust . As a consequence , the anti @-@ Domitianic tradition was already well established by the end of the 2nd century , and by the 3rd century , even expanded upon by early Church historians , who identified Domitian as an early persecutor of Christians , such as in the Acts of John . 
 = = = Modern revisionism = = = 
 Hostile views of Domitian were propagated until well into the early 20th century , before archeological and numismatic advances brought renewed attention to his reign , and necessitated a revision of the literary tradition established by Tacitus and Pliny . In 1930 , Ronald Syme argued a complete reassessment of Domitian 's financial policy , which had until then been largely viewed as a disaster , opening his paper with the following introduction : 
 The work of the spade and the use of common sense have done much to mitigate the influence of Tacitus and Pliny and redeem the memory of Domitian from infamy or oblivion . But much remains to be done . 
 Ronald Syme , Imperial finances under Domitian , Nerva and Trajan 
 Over the course of the 20th century , Domitian 's military , administrative and economic policies were re @-@ evaluated . New book length studies were not published until the 1990s however , nearly a hundred years after Stéphane Gsell 's Essai sur le <unk> de l 'empereur <unk> ( 1894 ) . The most important of these was The Emperor Domitian , by Brian W. Jones . In his monograph , Jones concludes that Domitian was a ruthless , but efficient autocrat . For the majority of his reign , there was no widespread dissatisfaction with the emperor or his rule . His harshness was felt by only a small , but highly vocal minority , who later exaggerated his despotism in favour of the well @-@ regarded Nervan @-@ Antonian dynasty that followed . 
 Domitian 's foreign policy was realistic , rejecting expansionist warfare and negotiating peace at a time when Roman military tradition dictated aggressive conquest . His economic program , which was rigorously efficient , maintained the Roman currency at a standard it would never again achieve . Persecution of religious minorities , such as Jews and Christians , was non @-@ existent . Domitian 's government nonetheless exhibited totalitarian characteristics . As Emperor , he saw himself as the new Augustus , an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new era of Flavian renaissance . 
 Religious , military and cultural propaganda fostered a cult of personality . He deified three of his family members and erected massive structures to commemorate the Flavian achievements . Elaborate triumphs were celebrated in order to boost his image as a warrior @-@ emperor , but many of these were either unearned or premature . By nominating himself perpetual censor , he sought to control public and private morals . 
 He became personally involved in all branches of the government and successfully prosecuted corruption among public officials . The dark side of his censorial power involved a restriction in freedom of speech , and an increasingly oppressive attitude toward the Roman Senate . He punished libel with exile or death and , due to his suspicious nature , increasingly accepted information from informers to bring false charges of treason if necessary . 
 Although contemporary historians vilified Domitian after his death , his administration provided the foundation for the Principate of the peaceful 2nd century . His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive , but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian 's . Much more than a " gloomy coda to the ... 1st century " the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96 , in a reign that Theodor Mommsen described as the sombre but intelligent despotism of Domitian .

 The 18th Boat Race took place on the River Thames on 16 March 1861 . Held annually , The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge . The 1861 event , which featured the first ever non @-@ British competitor , suffered numerous interruptions from river traffic . Oxford won by 16 lengths . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having defeated Oxford by one length in the previous year 's race and led overall with ten wins to Oxford 's seven . 
 The challenge to race was sent from Oxford in the October term which was accepted by Cambridge . Both boats were built specifically for the race , Cambridge 's by Searle and Oxford 's by Salter . Oxford were " occasionally looked after " by H. Baxter , who rowed in the 1860 race , and C. G. Lane who represented the Dark Blues in the 1858 and 1859 races . The race was umpired by Joseph William Chitty who had rowed for Oxford twice in 1849 ( in the March and December races ) and the 1852 race . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 11 st 4 @.@ 875 lb ( 71 @.@ 9 kg ) , 0 @.@ 875 pounds ( 0 @.@ 4 kg ) per rower more than their Dark Blue opposition . George Morrison returned to the Oxford crew , having rowed in the previous year 's race . Cambridge saw Chaytor , Blake , Coventry and Hall return . The race featured the first non @-@ British rower in the history of the event : William Robertson of Wadham College , Oxford was educated at Geelong Grammar School in Australia before representing the Dark Blues at number four . 
 = = Race = = 
 As a result of strong winds and a large volume of land water running into the river , the race was re @-@ scheduled for 11am . Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station , handing the Surrey station to Oxford . The starter , Edward Searle , gave the command to start , with neither boat taking an early advantage . By the Star and Garter pub , Cambridge had edged ahead and spurted to take a half @-@ length lead and by the Duke 's Head pub , the Light Blues had moved further in front . A steering error from Gaskell , the Cambridge cox , saw their lead eroded such that Oxford led by Craven Cottage . At the football ground , rough water created by one of the nearby steamboats ( who , according to MacMichael , had " shamefully put her paddle @-@ wheels into motion " ) caused a swell to slow the Oxford boat . 
 The Dark Blue crew 's rhythm combined with more poor steering from Cambridge allowed Oxford to pull away , three lengths ahead by the Crab Tree and six by Hammersmith Bridge . Further interruption to Cambridge 's passage came from a sailing barge which they forced to steer around , and by Chiswick , they were ten lengths behind . Oxford suffered briefly at the hands of a barge blocking their route but by Barnes Bridge were at least twelve lengths ahead . They passed the flag boat ( indicating the finish of the race ) at the Ship Tavern in a time of 23 minutes 30 seconds , and a lead of 16 lengths . It was the largest winning margin since the 1841 race and would be the first in a series of nine consecutive victories for Oxford . 
 = Tropical Storm Dean ( 1983 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Dean caused minor flooding along portions of the East Coast of the United States in September 1983 . The seventh tropical cyclone and fourth named storm the 1983 Atlantic hurricane season , Dean developed from a frontal low to the northeast of the Bahamas on September 26 . Initially subtropical , it gained characteristics of a tropical cyclone while tracking slowly north @-@ northeastward . By September 27 , the system was reclassified as Tropical Storm Dean . While tracking northward on September 28 , Dean peaked with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) , shortly before curving west @-@ northwestward and slowly leveling @-@ off in intensity . Eventually , Dean made landfall in Virginia on the Delmarva Peninsula on September 29 as a weakening tropical storm . Dean rapidly weakened over land and was no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by early on October 1 . 
 Offshore Virginia , swells generated by the storm stranded a tugboat and injured two people . Waves along the coast also caused beach erosion , especially in Virginia and North Carolina . Inland , effects were minor and generally limited to mostly light rainfall . More than 100 campers on the Outer Banks of North Carolina were forced to evacuate due to flooding on North Carolina Highway 12 . Although near @-@ hurricane @-@ force wind gusts pelted coastal areas of Virginia and North Carolina , wind damage from the storm was minimal . The remnants of the storm brought rainfall to portions of New England , especially to Connecticut , where precipitation from the storm peaked at 4 @.@ 62 in ( 117 mm ) . Damage from the storm was unknown , but presumed to be minimal . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A frontal cloud band moved offshore the East Coast of the United States on September 22 . During the next few days , the cloud band became stationary while stretching from The Bahamas to northeast of Bermuda . Around that time , a 1 @,@ 035 mbar ( 30 @.@ 6 inHg ) high pressure stalled over the Northeastern United States , producing a strong pressure gradient and gale force winds over the East Coast of the United States . While located about 455 mi ( 732 km ) east of Vero Beach , Florida , a low @-@ level circulation developed within the frontal cloud band on September 26 . At around 1800 UTC that day , the NHC classified the system as a subtropical storm , due to a ship report of gale force winds 230 mi ( 370 km ) from the center . Initially , it tracked north @-@ northeastward under the influence of the frontal cloud band that spawned the storm . The wind field quickly condensed , while the storm itself separated from the frontal cloud band . As a result , it was re @-@ classified as Tropical Storm Dean at 1800 UTC on September 27 while approximately 575 mi ( 925 km ) east of Jacksonville , Florida . The National Hurricane Center , which initiated advisories on the storm at 2200 UTC on the same day , indicated that a weak ridge to the north and a cold low moving offshore of the Southeastern United States would cause Dean to move slowly and possibly curve northwestward . 
 Early on September 28 , a reconnaissance aircraft recorded Dean 's minimum barometric pressure of 999 mbar ( 29 @.@ 5 inHg ) . Although forecast models initially indicated that the storm would continue northeastward , they quickly switched to a westward movement on September 29 . After curving northwestward later that day , Dean attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) , as reported by a ship . While a reconnaissance aircraft flew into Dean north of center late on September 29 , it reported hurricane @-@ force wind gusts . However , the storm soon began to weaken . At around 1200 UTC on September 30 , Dean made landfall in Virginia on the Delmarva Peninsula with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . Operationally , the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories four hours after Dean struck the state . At 1800 UTC on September 30 , the storm weakened to a tropical depression . At 0000 UTC on October 1 , Dean became unidentifiable as a tropical cyclone while located over Virginia near the mouth of the Potomac River . The remnants continued northwestward , before curving to the northeast while near the border of Virginia and West Virginia . It crossed the Mid @-@ Atlantic and New England before re @-@ emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near Boston , Massachusetts . By October 2 , the remnants of Dean had dissipated just offshore of the East Coast of the United States . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 As Dean approached the United States , numerous gale warnings were issued . Many of these warnings were issued from North Carolina up to Rhode Island . Small craft advisories were also raised along much of the eastern seaboard , covering places between Cape Cod , Massachusetts to Jupiter Inlet , Florida . In Norfolk , Virginia , the naval station was placed under " hurricane condition 3 " , meaning that destructive winds were anticipated within 48 hours . In parts of North Carolina , residents were urged to prepare for the storm and remain out of the rough coastal waters . 
 As the storm moved inland over Virginia , its outer bands and high winds prompted more than 100 campers on Ocracoke Island and Cape Hatteras to evacuate after 1 ft ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) of water flooded North Carolina Highway 12 . Along the coast , wave between 6 and 10 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 and 3 @.@ 0 m ) were measured . Minor beach erosion ensued , although some beaches lost as much as 20 ft ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) of sand . Squall lines associated with Dean brought near @-@ hurricane @-@ force wind gusts and brief , heavy rainfall . Winds caused little effect other than isolated power outages , especially on the Outer Banks . Aside from the minor damage caused by Dean , there was also a positive side to the storm . Throughout coastal waters off North Carolina , king mackerel appeared in near @-@ record numbers , improving the local fishing industry . Some catchers stated that they were finding some fish weighing up to 30 lb ( 14 kg ) . 
 About 300 mi ( 480 km ) off the coast of Virginia , large swells from Dean stranded a tugboat on September 29 with six people on board . Two of the crew were injured during the incident ; however , they were not seriously hurt . The ship was towed to Cape May , New Jersey later that day by the United States Coast Guard . Waves up to 8 ft ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) caused beach erosion across the Virginia coastline . In addition to minor erosion , waves caused " slight flooding " at <unk> Beach , totaling to $ 500 to $ 5 @,@ 000 in damage ( 1983 USD ) . Although winds were estimated to have been around 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) as the storm moved inland , structural damage was minimal . Many areas near Dean 's path experienced light rainfall of 1 to 3 in ( 25 to 76 mm ) of rain , especially in Virginia where the statewide peak was 1 @.@ 29 in ( 33 mm ) in Richmond . 
 In Maryland , thousands of tons of sand was removed by rough seas near Ocean City ; beach erosion also occurred at nearby Assateague Island . Additionally , wind gusts between 50 and 55 mph ( 80 and 89 km / h ) resulted in minor damage , while minimal flooding was reported following rainfall . Damage in Maryland was light , totaling to between $ 500 and $ 5 @,@ 000 ( 1983 USD ) . Minor effects were reported in Delaware , limited to winds gusts up to 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , which caused the loss of tons of sand along beaches . In coastal New Jersey , locally heavy rainfall resulted in traffic jams , downed power lines , and numerous commuting problems . In some areas of New York , especially in the southeastern portions of the state , rainfall exceeding 2 in ( 51 mm ) in 24 hours flooded roadways and delayed trains . The remnants of Dean dropped light precipitation in New England . Rainfall from the storm peaked at 4 @.@ 62 in ( 117 mm ) at the <unk> Ranger Station in Connecticut . 
 = 1869 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1869 Atlantic hurricane season was the earliest season in the Atlantic hurricane database in which there were at least ten tropical cyclones . Initially there were only three known storms in the year , but additional research uncovered the additional storms . Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms may remain missing from the official database for each season in this era , due to small tropical cyclone size , sparse ship reports , and relatively unpopulated coastlines . All activity occurred in a three @-@ month period between the middle of August and early October . 
 Out of the ten tropical storms , seven reached hurricane intensity , of which four made landfall on the United States . The strongest hurricane was a Category 3 on the modern @-@ day Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale which struck New England at that intensity , one of four storms to do so . It left heavy damage , killing at least one person . The most notable hurricane of the season was the Saxby Gale , which was predicted nearly a year in advance . The hurricane was one of six to produce hurricane force winds in Maine , where it left heavy damage and flooding . The Saxby Gale left 37 deaths along its path , with its destruction greatest along the Bay of Fundy ; there , the hurricane produced a 70 @.@ 9 ft ( 21 @.@ 6 m ) high tide near the head of the bay .

 The first tropical cyclone of the season was observed on August 12 , about 500 mi ( 800 km ) southeast of Cape Race , Newfoundland . Its entire track was unknown , and its existence was only confirmed for 24 hours , based on three ship reports . The second , a barque , the Prinze Frederik Carl , sustained damage to all of its sails . The Hurricane Research Division ( HRD ) assessed the storm to have moved northeastward in its limited duration , and based on the ship reports estimated peak winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) ; this would make it a Category 2 hurricane on the modern @-@ day Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale .

 By August 16 , a strong hurricane was located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico south of Louisiana . With estimated winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) , it tracked westward and struck Texas on Matagorda Island before passing near Refugio . The hurricane quickly weakened over land and dissipated late on August 17 . Damage from the hurricane was heaviest in Refugio and Indianola . In the latter city , strong waves damaged wharves and boats while the storm surge flooded the streets with about 1 ft ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) of water . Intense winds knocked down several houses as well as a church , and many buildings lost their roofs . In Sabine Pass , the winds ruined a variety of fruit crops .

 On September 7 , three ships observed hurricane force winds over the western Atlantic Ocean , between the Bahamas and Bermuda . The storm moved northward , impacting several other ships as it paralleled the east coast of the United States ; one of them reported a pressure of 956 mbar ( 28 @.@ 24 inHg ) , which indicated the system was an intense hurricane . Late on September 8 , it reached a peak intensity of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) with a pressure of 950 mbar ( 28 @.@ 05 inHg ) . After brushing Long Island , the hurricane weakened slightly and made landfall on southwestern Rhode Island at peak intensity . It was one of four hurricanes , along with the 1938 New England hurricane , the 1944 Great Atlantic hurricane , and Hurricane Carol in 1954 , to strike New England as a major hurricane , or Category 3 or higher on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . 
 At landfall , the hurricane was compact , estimated around 60 mi ( 97 km ) wide . However , less than 10 miles ( 16 km ) west of the center , there were no strong winds . The hurricane produced a storm surge of 8 ft ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) , which was lessened due to it moving ashore at low tide . In Providence , Rhode Island , high waves damaged coastal wharves and left flooding . The hurricane weakened quickly over land , passing just west of Boston early on September 9 as a minimal hurricane . There , the winds downed many trees and left severe damage . All telegraph lines between New York and Boston were cut , although the storm did produce beneficial heavy rainfall . Shortly thereafter it dissipated over Maine . There was one confirmed death in Massachusetts . Offshore Maine , a schooner capsized , killing all but one in the crew .

 A ship about halfway between South America and Cape Verde reported a hurricane on September 11 .

On September 15 , a ship traveling from St. Thomas to England encountered the hurricane and observed a minimum barometric pressure of 979 mbar ( 28 @.@ 90 inHg ) ; this suggested peak winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) .

 The only basis for identifying the eighth tropical cyclone of the season was from a report by the bark Crescent Wave .

 The final hurricane of the season was first observed on October 4 by a ship off the southeast coast of North Carolina . With winds estimated at 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) , the storm tracked northeastward , passing just east of Martha 's Vineyard before moving across Cape Cod late on October 4 . As it moved along the coast , the storm produced heavy precipitation , reaching 12 @.@ 25 in ( 311 mm ) in Canton , Connecticut . The strongest winds did not affect Massachusetts , although a few hours later the hurricane struck just east of Portland , Maine at peak intensity . This made it one of six storms to produce hurricane @-@ force winds in Maine , along with Hurricane Carol in 1953 , Hurricane Edna in 1954 , Hurricane Donna in 1960 , Hurricane Gerda in 1969 , and Hurricane Gloria in 1985 . In Maine , the high rainfall caused widespread flooding , while the high winds destroyed at least 90 houses . The hurricane quickly weakened over land , and after turning northeastward into Atlantic Canada dissipated on October 5 near the Gulf of St. Lawrence . 
 The hurricane was referred as Saxby 's Gale after Lieutenant S.M. Saxby of the Royal Navy predicted in November 1868 that an unusually violent storm would produce very high tides on October 5 ; he did not specify the location , however . Although heavy damage occurred in New England , the devastation was greatest in Atlantic Canada along the Bay of Fundy . The hurricane produced a storm surge of around 7 ft ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) , which , in combination with the winds , the low pressure , and being in a region of naturally occurring high tides , produced a 70 @.@ 9 ft ( 21 @.@ 6 m ) high tide near the head of the bay . The high tides surpassed the dykes across New Brunswick and left widespread flooding , killing many cattle and sheep and washing away roads . In the Cumberland Basin , the floods washed two boats about 3 mi ( 5 km ) inland . In Moncton , water levels rose about 6 @.@ 6 ft ( 2 m ) higher than the previous highest level . There were 37 deaths between Maine , New Brunswick , and New York . 
 = Bjaðmunjo <unk> = 
 Bjaðmunjo <unk> ( also known in Old Norse as <unk> ; and in Gaelic as Ben <unk> , Bé Binn , <unk> , and <unk> ; fl . 1102 / 1103 ) was a daughter of a Muirchertach Ua Briain , High King of Ireland . In 1102 whilst still a child , she was married to Sigurðr , son of Magnús Óláfsson , King of Norway . At this time , Magnús appears to have been in the process of setting up his son as king over the Earldom of Orkney , the Kingdom of the Isles , and the Kingdom of Dublin . The marriage itself temporarily bound Muirchertach and Magnús together as allies before the latter 's death the following year . Sigurðr thereupon repudiated Bjaðmunjo , and left for Scandinavia , where he proceeded to share the Norwegian kingship with his brothers . 
 = = Background = = 
 Bjaðmunjo was a daughter of Muirchertach Ua Briain , High King of Ireland ( died 1119 ) . In the late eleventh century , following the death of his father , Muirchertach seized control of the Kingdom of Munster and moved to extend his authority throughout Ireland as High King of Ireland . In so doing , he gained control of the Norse @-@ Gaelic Kingdom of Dublin , and as a result began to extend his influence into the nearby Kingdom of the Isles . There is uncertainty concerning the political situation in the Isles in the last decade of the eleventh century . What is known for sure is that , before the end of the century , Magnús Óláfsson , King of Norway ( died 1103 ) led a marauding fleet from Scandinavia into the Irish Sea region , where he held power until his death in 1103 . 
 The catalyst for this Norwegian intervention may have been the extension of Muirchertach 's influence into the Irish Sea region following the death of Gofraid Crobán , King of the Isles ( died 1095 ) . The region itself appears to have degenerated into chaos following Gofraid 's demise , and Magnús seems to have taken it upon himself to reassert Norwegian authority . Magnús made two expeditions into the Irish Sea region . One arrived in 1098 ; the other in 1102 . The focus of the second overseas operation appears to have been Ireland itself . Following an apparent Norwegian conquest of Dublin , Magnús and Muirchertach negotiated a peace agreement , sealed through the marriage of Magnús ' son , Sigurðr ( died 1130 ) , and Bjaðmunjo herself . 
 = = Marriage = = 
 The marriage agreement between Magnús and Muirchertach is noted in several sources . The Annals of Inisfallen and the Annals of the Four Masters reveal that the marriage to place in 1102 . Other sources reporting the marriage include Ágrip af Nóregskonungasögum , Orkneyinga saga , and Magnúss saga <unk> within Heimskringla . The forms of Bjaðmunjo 's name in these Scandinavian sources ( Bjaðmunjo and <unk> ) suggest that they may represent the Gaelic Bé Binn , a name known to have been borne by other members of the Uí Briain . Other Gaelic names equated to that of Bjaðmunjo include Ben <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . Sigurðr was apparently twelve @-@ years @-@ old at the time of the marriage , although Bjaðmunjo 's age is uncertain . The remarkably young age of the newlyweds , and the fact that the union is recorded at all in historical sources , suggests that a dynastic marriage was required for the conclusion of peace between their fathers . 
 There seems to be some confusion in several historical sources regarding the marriage . For example , the twelfth @-@ century monk <unk> Vitalis ( died 1142 × ) claimed that Magnús himself married the daughter of an Irish king in about 1093 . According to Morkinskinna , Magnús was at one point set to marry a certain Maktildr , described as an " emperor 's daughter " . It is possible that Maktildr represents Matilda ( died 1118 ) , a woman who was a sister of the reigning <unk> mac Maíl Choluim , King of Scotland ( died 1107 ) , and who is known to have married Henry I , King of England ( died 1135 ) in 1110 . In fact , the episode concerning Magnús and Maktildr in Morkinskinna may have influenced the erroneous claim preserved by the same source and Fagrskinna purporting that Sigurðr married a daughter of Máel Coluim mac Donnchada , King of Scotland . At about the same time as the marriage between Bjaðmunjo and Sigurðr , the former 's father secured yet another marital alliance through another daughter and Arnulf de Montgomery , Earl of Pembroke ( died 1118 × 1122 ) , an English magnate in the midst of a revolt against the reigning King of England . 
 = = Ramifications = = 
 Just prior to the settlement of peace between the Uí Briain and the Norwegians , Muirchertach was not only contending with the arrival of Magnús , but was also locked in an extended struggle with Domnall Mac Lochlainn , King of Cenél nEógain ( died 1121 ) . The agreement of a year 's peace between Muirchertach and Magnús , however , turned Magnús from an enemy into an ally . Whilst Magnús appears to have intended for Sigurðr to rule over his recently @-@ won overseas territories — a region stretching from Orkney to Dublin — Muirchertach appears to have intended to exert influence into the Isles through his new son @-@ in @-@ law . In fact , during the following year , Muirchertach and Magnús cooperated in military operations throughout Ireland . Unfortunately for Muirchertach , and his long @-@ term ambitions in Ireland and the Isles , Magnús was slain in Ulster in 1103 . Thereupon Morkinskinna and Fagrskinna reveal that Sigurðr immediately repudiated Bjaðmunjo — their marriage apparently having been unconsummated — and returned to Norway . There Sigurðr proceeded to share the Norwegian kingship with his two brothers , Eysteinn ( died 1123 ) and Óláfr ( died 1115 ) . It would over one hundred and fifty years until another King of Norway ventured into the Isles .

 The Danton @-@ class battleship was a class of six pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the French Navy ( Marine Nationale ) before World War I. The ships were assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet after commissioning in 1911 . After the beginning of World War I in early August 1914 , five of the sister ships participated in the Battle of Antivari . They spent most of the rest of the war blockading the Straits of Otranto and the Dardanelles to prevent warships of the Central Powers from breaking out into the Mediterranean . One ship was sunk by a German submarine in 1917 . 
 The remaining five ships were obsolescent by the end of the war and most were assigned to secondary roles . Two of the sisters were sent to the Black Sea to support the Whites during the Russian Civil War . One ship ran aground and the crew of the other mutinied after one of its members was killed during a protest against intervention in support of the Whites . Both ships were quickly condemned and later sold for scrap . The remaining three sisters received partial modernizations in the mid @-@ 1920s and became training ships until they were condemned in the mid @-@ 1930s and later scrapped . The only survivor still afloat at the beginning of World War II in August 1939 had been hulked in 1931 and was serving as part of the navy 's torpedo school . She was captured by the Germans when they occupied Vichy France in 1942 and scuttled by them after the Allied invasion of southern France in 1944 .

 The Danton @-@ class ships were ordered as the second tranche of a French naval expansion plan that began in response to the growth of the Imperial German Navy after 1900 . Discussions began in 1905 for an enlarged version of the preceding Liberté @-@ class design . French analyses of the Russian defeat by the Japanese at the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905 credited the latter 's victory to the large number of medium @-@ caliber hits that heavily damaged the superstructures of the Russian ships and started many fires that the crews had difficulty extinguishing . The superior speed and handling of the Japanese ships was also credited with a role in their victory . 
 The French decided that the increasing range of naval combat dictated the use of the 240 @-@ millimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) gun in lieu of the 194 @-@ millimeter ( 7 @.@ 6 in ) gun used on the Liberté class as the larger gun had a greater ability to penetrate armor at longer ranges while still having a good rate of fire . The navy also wanted a faster ship , but this could only be done by reducing armor thicknesses without exceeding the 18 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 18 @,@ 000 long tons ) limit imposed by the Minister of the Navy , Gaston Thomson , for budgetary reasons . A preliminary design with the usual triple @-@ expansion steam engines was accepted in March 1906 , but various modifications were requested . One proposal was made to replace the 240 @-@ millimeter guns turrets with single 305 @-@ millimeter ( 12 in ) turrets to create an " all @-@ big @-@ gun " ship , like the British battleship HMS Dreadnought , but this was rejected as it would have raised the displacement above the 18 @,@ 000 @-@ metric ton limit and the slower @-@ firing 305 @-@ millimeter guns would have reduced the volume and weight of fire to an unacceptable degree . 
 Initial parliamentary discussion of the design focused less on the anticipated cost of the ships than the idea that France was being left behind in the technological arms race , particularly in regard to the innovative Parsons steam turbines used by HMS Dreadnought . In response the navy sent a technical mission to inspect the Parsons factory , several shipyards , and gun factories as well as the Barr & Stroud rangefinder factory in May 1906 and concluded that the turbines offered more power in a smaller volume than triple @-@ expansion steam engines at a significant increase in fuel consumption at low speeds . Two ships had already been ordered from the naval dockyards three months previously when the navy decided to use the turbines in July . To further complicate things , Gaston requested a study using the heavier and more powerful 45 @-@ caliber 305 @-@ millimeter Modèle 1906 gun on 3 August while not endorsing the navy 's decision to use turbines . On 6 October the director of naval construction , M. <unk> , urgently requested a decision while recommending that three ships use steam engines and the others turbines . He felt that this would minimize delays and expense as the design needed to be modified to accommodate the turbines and their four propeller shafts , no company in France knew how to build the turbines , and the latter were three times as expensive as steam engines . Gaston was inclined to accept <unk> 's recommendation , but prevaricated until December , after parliamentary debates showed overwhelming support for turbines in all six ships . Contracts for the remaining four ships were signed on 26 December , the day after the conclusion of the debate . Gaston also delayed in deciding on which boilers to use . He sent another technical mission to Britain to look at Babcock & Wilcox 's design in April 1907 , but did not make a decision in favor of French @-@ built boilers until 3 June 1908 , after all the ships had been laid down . 
 The design was estimated to displace 18 @,@ 318 tonnes ( 18 @,@ 029 long tons ) before the adoption of the heavier Modèle 1906 gun required a new and larger turret to handle the gun which meant that the turret 's supporting structure also had to be reinforced . In an unsuccessful bid to reduce the displacement , many sections of armor were reduced in thickness , but the ships exceeded even the design estimate as built . 
 = = General description = = 
 The Dantons were significantly larger than their predecessors of the Liberté class . The ships were 145 meters ( 475 ft 9 in ) long at the waterline and 146 @.@ 6 meters ( 481 ft 0 in ) long overall , over 13 meters ( 42 ft 8 in ) longer than the earlier ships . They had a beam of 25 @.@ 8 meters ( 84 ft 8 in ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 44 meters ( 27 ft 8 in ) at deep load . The Danton @-@ class ships were slightly overweight ; they actually displaced 18 @,@ 754 metric tons ( 18 @,@ 458 long tons ) at normal load . This was over 4 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 3 @,@ 900 long tons ) more than the earlier ships . When serving as flagships , their crew consisted of 40 officers and 875 enlisted men . Without an admiral and his staff embarked , the crew numbered 28 officers and 824 enlisted men . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Danton @-@ class ships had four license @-@ built Parsons direct @-@ drive steam turbines , each of which drove a single propeller , using steam from 26 coal @-@ fired Belleville or Niclausse boilers . Each boiler type was installed on three ships of the class . The boilers were housed in two large compartments , 17 in the forward boiler room that used the three forward funnels and 9 in the aft boiler which exhausted through the rear pair of funnels . The <unk> were amidships , between the boiler rooms , in three compartments . The center engine room housed the turbines for the two center propeller shafts and the turbine for each of the outer shafts had their own compartment flanking the center engine room . The turbines were rated at a total of 22 @,@ 500 shaft horsepower ( 16 @,@ 800 kW ) using steam provided by the boilers at a working pressure of 18 kg / cm2 ( 1 @,@ 765 kPa ; 256 psi ) . Designed for a maximum speed of 19 @.@ 25 knots ( 35 @.@ 65 km / h ; 22 @.@ 15 mph ) , they handily exceeded that during their sea trials with speeds ranging from 19 @.@ 7 to 20 @.@ 66 knots ( 36 @.@ 5 to 38 @.@ 3 km / h ; 22 @.@ 7 to 23 @.@ 8 mph ) . 
 The Niclausse boilers were not well suited for use with turbines and burned more coal than the Belleville boilers . They also produced copious amounts of smoke and sparks ; occasionally even flames from incomplete combustion of the coal . The Dantons carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 027 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 995 long tons ) of coal which gave them an estimated range from 3 @,@ 120 – 4 @,@ 866 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 778 – 9 @,@ 012 km ; 3 @,@ 590 – 5 @,@ 600 mi ) at a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) , depending on which boilers were fitted . Their endurance was almost half that of their predecessors due to the uneconomical fuel consumption of their turbines at low speeds and meant that they needed frequent coaling stops during the war . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The main battery of the Danton @-@ class ships consisted of four 305 mm Modèle 1906 guns mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one each fore and aft of the superstructure . Each turret could elevate up to + 12 ° that gave the guns a maximum range of 14 @,@ 500 meters ( 15 @,@ 900 yd ) . The guns fired 440 @-@ kilogram ( 970 lb ) armour @-@ piercing projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 780 m / s ( 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ) at a rate of 1 @.@ 5 rounds per minute . Each turret stored eight rounds along the rear wall and their propellant was kept between the floor of the firing chamber and the bottom of the turret . The ships normally stowed 75 rounds per gun , but space was available for an additional 10 rounds . Their secondary armament consisted of twelve 240mm / 50 Modèle 1902 guns in six twin @-@ gun turrets , three on each side of the ship . Maximum elevation of the turrets was + 13 ° and the 240 @-@ kilogram ( 530 lb ) shell could be fired to a range of 14 @,@ 000 meters ( 15 @,@ 000 yd ) . The guns could fire at a rate of two rounds per minute . Each turret had space for 12 shells and the necessary 36 propellant charges ; 80 rounds per gun was normally carried , but maximum capacity was 100 rounds per gun . 
 The Dantons carried a number of smaller guns to defend themselves against torpedo boats . These included sixteen 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) Modèle 1908 Schneider guns mounted in unarmored embrasures in the hull sides . These guns had a range of 8 @,@ 000 meters ( 8 @,@ 700 yd ) and could fire approximately 15 rounds per minute . Because the shell hoists were slow and the shells difficult to handle in their three @-@ round cases in the magazines , a total of 576 rounds were stored close to the guns in ready @-@ use lockers . Each gun was provided with 400 rounds , but the maximum storage available was 430 rounds per gun . The ships also mounted ten 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns in pivot mounts on the superstructure . They had the same rate of fire as the larger 75 mm guns , but only a range of 6 @,@ 000 meters ( 6 @,@ 600 yd ) . Each gun had 36 rounds nearby in ready @-@ use lockers and the ships were provided with a maximum of 800 rounds per gun . 
 The battleships were also armed with two submerged 450 @-@ millimeter ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes , one on each broadside . Each tube was angled 10 ° forward and 3 ° downward . Each ship carried six Modèle <unk> torpedoes . They had a 114 @-@ kilogram ( 251 lb ) warhead and two speed / range settings : 3 @,@ 000 meters ( 3 @,@ 300 yd ) at 28 knots ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) or 2 @,@ 000 meters ( 2 @,@ 200 yd ) at 33 knots ( 61 km / h ; 38 mph ) . The Dantons also had storage space for 10 Harlé Modèle 1906 mines , which had an explosive charge of 60 kilograms ( 130 lb ) of guncotton . These could not be laid by the ships themselves , but had to be off @-@ loaded for use . 
 = = = Fire control = = = 
 Finding the British Barr & Stroud coincidence rangefinder design superior to existing French designs , the Dantons mounted a pair of 2 @-@ meter ( 6 ft 7 in ) <unk> rangefinders atop the conning tower and a 1 @.@ 37 @-@ meter ( 4 ft 6 in ) rangefinder on each turret top for use by the turret commanders . Integrating these into the overall fire @-@ control system took some time so eight <unk> & <unk> <unk> , which required knowledge of the target 's mast height and overall length , were used in the interim . During the war , the rangefinders were replaced by longer , more precise instrument . A triple 4 @.@ 57 @-@ meter ( 15 ft 0 in ) model was installed above the conning tower and 2 @-@ meter models replaced the smaller ones on the turret roofs . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The Danton @-@ class ships were built with 6 @,@ 725 metric tons ( 6 @,@ 619 long tons ) of armor , 36 percent of their designed displacement and almost 1 @,@ 200 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 200 long tons ) more than their predecessors . Their waterline armored belt had a maximum thickness of 250 millimeters ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) between the fore and aft turrets that reduced to 180 millimeters ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) towards the bow and stern . The belt consisted of two strakes of armor , 4 @.@ 5 meters ( 14 ft 9 in ) high , that covered the sides of the hull up to the main deck and extended 1 @.@ 1 m ( 3 ft 7 in ) below the normal waterline . Most of the lower armor plates tapered to a thickness of 80 – 100 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) along their bottom edge and the upper plates tapered to 220 millimeters ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) amidships and down to 140 millimeters ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) at the ends of the ship . The belt armour was backed by 80 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) of teak . It extended almost the entire length of the ship , with only the very stern unprotected . At the stern , the belt terminated in a 200 @-@ millimeter ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) transverse bulkhead ; the forward 154 @-@ millimeter ( 6 @.@ 1 in ) transverse bulkhead connected the sides of the forward barbette to the belt . 
 The main gun turrets had 340 millimeters ( 13 @.@ 4 in ) of armor on their faces , 260 @-@ millimeter ( 10 in ) sides , and roofs of three layers of 24 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 94 in ) mild @-@ steel plates . Their barbettes were protected by 246 millimeters ( 9 @.@ 7 in ) of armor which thinned to 66 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) below the upper protected deck . The secondary gun turrets had 225 @-@ millimeter ( 8 @.@ 9 in ) faces , 188 @-@ millimeter ( 7 @.@ 4 in ) sides , and a roof of three layers of 17 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 67 in ) plates . The 240 @-@ millimeter turret barbettes had sides 154 to 148 millimeters ( 6 @.@ 1 to 5 @.@ 8 in ) . The front of the conning tower had armour 266 millimeters ( 10 @.@ 5 in ) thick and its sides were 216 millimeters ( 8 @.@ 5 in ) . The walls of its communication tube down to the fire @-@ control center ( <unk> central de tir ) were 200 millimeters thick down to the upper protected deck . 
 The ships had two protected decks ( the pont <unk> supérieur and the pont <unk> <unk> ( PBI ) ) , each formed from triple layers of mild steel 15 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) or 16 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 63 in ) thick . The lower of these , the PBI , curved downwards towards the sides of the hull to meet the torpedo bulkhead and the curved portion was reinforced by the substitution of a 40 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) plate of armor in lieu of the uppermost 15 @-@ millimeter plate of mild steel . The PBI also sloped downward toward the bow and was similarly reinforced to form an armored glacis . The Dantons had an internal anti @-@ torpedo bulge 2 meters ( 6 ft 7 in ) deep along the side of the hull below the waterline . It was backed by a torpedo bulkhead that consisted of three layers of 15 @-@ millimeter armor plate . Inboard of the bulkhead were 16 watertight compartments , 12 of which were normally kept empty , but the 4 abreast the boiler rooms were used as coal bunkers . This system of protection had only mixed success in practice as Danton capsized in 40 minutes after two torpedo hits while Voltaire survived her two torpedoes .

 = = Construction and careers = = 
 The Dantons took a long time to build . Construction was prolonged by a number of factors , chief of which were the 500 plus changes were made to the original design and in the inability of Gaston to make a timely decision . This meant that the builders sometimes had to rip out already completed sections to incorporate the modifications . Other problems were shortages of necessary infrastructure at the shipyards , lengthy delays in delivery of parts , and labor shortages and a lack of building slips in the naval dockyards . For example , water in the lower end of the newly completed Point @-@ du @-@ Jour slip at Brest meant that building Danton 's stern was delayed four months after the bow began and construction of Mirabeau could not begin until the armored cruiser Waldeck @-@ Rousseau was launched . 
 After commissioning in 1911 , all six ships were assigned to the First Battle Squadron ( Première escadre de ligne ) of the Mediterranean Fleet where they participated in the fleet maneuvers in May – June 1913 . When the war began , the squadron , under the command of Vice Admiral Paul <unk> , was at sea preparing to escort troop convoys from French North Africa to France . Some of the ships unsuccessfully searched for the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and the light cruiser SMS Breslau in the Western Mediterranean and escorted convoys . Later that month , all of the ships , except Mirabeau , participated in the Battle of Antivari in the Adriatic Sea and helped to sink an Austro @-@ Hungarian protected cruiser . They spent most of the rest of the war blockading the Straits of Otranto and the Dardanelles to prevent German , Austro @-@ Hungarian and Turkish warships from breaking out . Mirabeau participated in the attempt to ensure Greek acquiescence to Allied operations in Macedonia in late 1916 . 
 = = = Post war = = = 
 Diderot , Mirabeau and Vergniaud briefly participated in the occupation of Constantinople after the end of the war and the latter two ships were sent to the Black Sea in early 1919 during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War . Vergniaud 's crew mutinied after one of its members was killed when a protest against intervention in support of the Whites was bloodily suppressed and forced the return of the French ships supporting the Whites . Mirabeau ran aground in February 1919 off the coast of the Crimea and could not be refloated until some of her guns and armor were removed . 
 All of the surviving ships except Condorcet were reduced to second @-@ line roles by 1920 . Mirabeau was not repaired after her salvage and was hulked for a few years before being sold . Vergniaud was in bad shape and became a target ship before she was sold for scrap . Voltaire and Diderot had their underwater protection modernized in the early 1920s and became training ships before they were condemned in the mid @-@ 1930s . Condorcet was assigned to the Channel Division in the early 1920s before she too had her underwater protection modernized . She also became a training ship after its completion , but she was hulked in 1931 and became a depot ship for the torpedo school . The ship was captured intact when the Germans occupied Toulon in November 1942 and was used by them as a barracks ship . Condorcet was scuttled by the Germans in August 1944 and refloated the following year before being scrapped . 
 Danton 's wreck was discovered in 2007 between Algeria and Sardinia at a depth of over 1 @,@ 000 meters ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) .

 Dangerously in Love is the debut studio album by American recording artist Beyoncé . It was released on June 24 , 2003 by Columbia Records . During the recording of Destiny 's Child 's third studio album , Survivor ( 2001 ) , the group announced that they would produce solo albums to be released . Recording sessions for the album took place from March 2002 to March 2003 at several studios , during the hiatus of her then @-@ group Destiny 's Child . As executive producer of the album , Beyoncé took a wider role in its production , co @-@ writing a majority of the songs , choosing which ones to produce and sharing ideas on the mixing and mastering of tracks . 
 The tracks in the album are a mixture of <unk> and ballads , which are basically inspired by R & B and soul genres ; it also features elements of hip hop and Arabic music . Although Beyoncé remained discreet about her interpretation of the songs , its underlying meanings were attributed by music writers as an allusion to her intimate relationship with then @-@ boyfriend and well @-@ known music mogul Jay @-@ Z. Dangerously in Love received positive reviews from music critics upon its release , with critics praising Knowles ' " artistic leap " . The album also received numerous accolades , earning Beyoncé five Grammy Awards . 
 Dangerously in Love propelled Beyoncé in becoming a viable solo star , as well as one of the most marketable singers in the recording industry . It became a worldwide commercial success , earning multi @-@ platinum certifications in Australia , the United Kingdom , and the United States . The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart , selling 317 @,@ 000 copies in its first week , earning Beyoncé the highest debut sales among Destiny 's Child members ' solo albums . Dangerously in Love has sold over 5 million copies in the United States as of 2016 and an estimated 11 million copies worldwide as of 2011 , and has produced two number one Billboard singles and multiple top tens .

 Beyoncé launched her career as lead singer to R & B group Destiny 's Child in the late 1990s . According to Corey Moss of MTV News , " fans are eager to see " how Beyoncé , after years with the group , performs solo . While recording their third album , Survivor , in late 2000 , Beyoncé announced the group would be put on hiatus in order for the members to produce solo albums in the coming years , which they hoped would boost interest in Destiny 's Child . The idea of individual releases emanated from the group 's manager and Beyoncé 's father , Mathew . 
 With different types of music for each member to produce , the albums were not intended to compete on the charts . Destiny 's Child 's management strategically planned to stagger the release of each group member 's album to maximise sales . Michelle Williams was the first to release a debut solo album , Heart to Yours , in April 2002 . Meanwhile , Beyoncé debuted on the big screen , starring in the comedy film Austin Powers in Goldmember , and recorded her debut single , " Work It Out " , which is featured on the soundtrack to the film . Rowland collaborated with American rapper Nelly on the song " Dilemma " as a featured artist ; it became a hit that year , leading the label to advance the release date of her debut solo album , Simply Deep , in late 2002 . Beyoncé also starred in The Fighting Temptations and recorded another solo single . In August 2002 , she collaborated with boyfriend Jay @-@ Z as featured vocalist on the song " ' 03 Bonnie & Clyde " . The single earned Beyoncé credibility and paved the way for the release of Dangerously in Love . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Before Beyoncé began recording for Dangerously in Love , she selected the producers with whom she would collaborate . For two days , she held meetings with prospective producers from the West Coast across the East Coast , and had interviews with them . Beyoncé went to Miami , Florida to begin sessions with Canadian record producer Scott Storch , her first collaborator , and lived in a Miami hotel in the following months . As she wanted to concentrate on the album , Beyoncé took her time to avoid pressure build @-@ up , significantly different from the hasty productions of Destiny 's Child . 
 As she did on Survivor , Beyoncé took a wider role in the production of Dangerously in Love , co @-@ writing a majority of the songs , choosing which ones to produce and sharing ideas on the mixing and mastering of tracks . Although Beyoncé did not create beats , she came up with melodies and ideas she shared with the producers . With 43 songs completed — 15 of which made it to the album — Beyoncé is credited as co @-@ writer and co @-@ producer , as well as the album 's executive producer alongside Matthew Knowles . 
 Beyoncé felt that recording an album without her group mates was " liberating and therapeutic " , coming into the studio and freely expressing her ideas with her collaborators . The dependency she developed with Destiny 's Child , however , meant it was harder " to be on [ her ] own creatively " . As she wanted to grow as an artist Beyoncé contacted other artists with a view to forming a collaborative partnership . When the collective finished writing several songs , she printed copies of each and sent them to prospective guest artists . She talked to them by phone for possible collaboration , eventually gaining their approval . Besides Jay @-@ Z , Beyoncé was able to work with Jamaican artist Sean Paul , American rapper Missy Elliott , among others . In contrast , some artists sent copies of songs to Beyoncé , which were eventually produced . Additionally , Beyoncé also worked with Timbaland and Missy Elliott on a track titled " Wrapped Around Me " for the album . Eventually , however , for reasons unknown , the song failed to appear on the album . 
 Dangerously in Love was originally a song of the same title which Beyoncé had written for Survivor . The song was deemed too sophisticated compared to other songs on Survivor , and the group decided not to release it as a single off the album . After recording several tracks for Dangerously in Love , Beyoncé decided to add " Dangerously in Love " , after realizing that it fit the overriding theme of the album . Since the album 's release date was postponed to capitalize on the success of " Dilemma " , Beyoncé had been offered the chance to further enhance the album . Although she was disappointed with the move , Beyoncé realized that " everything happens for a reason " , agreeing to return to the recording studio to work with other songwriters . This allowed her to record more songs , including the album 's lead single , " Crazy in Love " . In late 2002 , Beyoncé paused working on Dangerously in Love for a holiday tour with Destiny 's Child . With a few weeks left for recording in March 2003 , Beyoncé was still collaborating with other guests on the album , including Sean Paul and P. Diddy . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Beyoncé 's mother @-@ manager said that Dangerously in Love showcases her musical roots . While Williams and Rowland were on gospel and alternative pop , respectively , Beyoncé focused on recording R & B songs . Songs in the album are varied : from mid @-@ tempo and club @-@ oriented tracks in the first half , and ballads in the second half . Beyoncé commented : " My album is a good balance of ... ballads and ... mid @-@ tempos with just ridin ' -in @-@ your @-@ car feels , to a lot of ... up @-@ tempo club songs , to really sexy songs , to songs that make you feel emotional . It 's a nice mixture of different types of tracks . " Although the album contains high @-@ energy songs like " Crazy in Love " and " Naughty Girl " , the album 's focal mode , however , is slow and moody . Beyoncé said that she had written lots of ballads for the album . According to Beyoncé , she wanted to be understood as an artist and showcase her range , and by doing so , she blended various genres and musical influences in the album . The album incorporates R & B , hip hop , soul and reggae influences . The album took hip hop influences from Jay @-@ Z , Outkast , and Lil ' Kim ; the reggae is from Sean Paul ; and courtesy of Storch , the album explores Arabic music . His personal study of that kind of music gave the album a Middle Eastern vibe . Beyoncé and the producers also used a wide array of instrumentations . 
 When " ' 03 Bonnie & Clyde " was released as a single in late 2002 , critics and the public had speculated that Beyoncé and Jay @-@ Z were having a mutual affair . Despite widespread rumors , they remained silent about their relationship . According to critics , the title itself of the album sounded " more intriguing " with Beyoncé singing personal songs . Though love is the theme Beyoncé had incorporated in the album , " most the material is vague enough to be about any relationship " ; however , there are songs that suggested affirmation of their relationship . In the song " Signs " , Beyoncé sings about being in love with a Sagittarius , which coincidentally is Jay @-@ Z 's zodiac sign . In response to the persistent rumors about them , Beyoncé stated , " People can come to whatever conclusion they like ... That 's the beauty of music ... I 'm a singer , I 'll talk about writing songs all you want . But when it comes to certain personal things any normal person wouldn 't tell people they don 't know , I just feel like I don 't have to [ talk about it ] . " 
 Beyoncé said that Dangerously in Love is lyrically similar to Destiny 's Child 's albums . But because she only had to write for herself , Beyoncé had the chance to compose personally deeper songs than her previous records with the group . With a theme that is based upon different stages of a romantic relationship , Dangerously in Love contains songs that speak of love and honesty . In addition , Beyoncé admitted that there are songs about love @-@ making . The personal content of the album , however , was not generally attributed to Beyoncé 's own experiences — although some were based from hers — instead , the theme kept recurring in her mind . Beyoncé later explained : " I wanted to have an album that everyone could relate to and would listen to as long as I 'm alive and even after ... Love is something that never goes out of style . It 's something everybody experiences , and if they are not in love , people usually want to feel that ... " While some songs merely focus on the " beauty of love " , the album also explores another side of love , with songs that " celebrate breakup " and songs that narrate a woman 's desire to have a degree of control in a relationship . The album 's hidden track , " Daddy " , is a tribute to Beyoncé 's father , Mathew Knowles , who fronted Destiny 's Child as their manager . The song is an account of Beyoncé wanting her future husband and child to possess qualities similar to her father 's . Originally , Beyoncé did not intend to include the track in the album , having thought its lyrics would make her appear immature . However , considering it one of the songs that reflected her life at that transitional moment , she instead relegated " Daddy " as the closing track . 
 = = Release and promotion = = 
 Beyoncé said that she had trouble convincing executives at Columbia Records to release the album . The singer recounted that it almost was not released : " In 2003 , I had my first solo album . But when I played it through for my record label , they told me I didn 't have one hit on my album . I guess they were kinda right , I had five . ' Dangerously In Love ' , ' Naughty Girl ' , ' Me , Myself and I ' , ' Baby Boy ' and ' Crazy In Love ' . " Since " Dilemma " was concurrently charting atop the Billboard Hot 100 , Beyoncé 's management released , " Work It Out " , one of the songs on the soundtrack to Austin Powers in Goldmember , instead of a single from Dangerously in Love to preclude it from possibly competing with the former . 
 From the original release date of October 2002 , the album was pushed to December in the same year , and to May in the following year . Beyoncé recorded a version of " In da Club " , and served its way to mixtapes before its original release date . The single failed to dominate as a " dancefloor favorite " ; Mathew Knowles , however , confirmed that it was just a " buzz cut " and was not included in the album . Nonetheless , it earned enough airplay to appear on the Billboard Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Singles & Tracks chart . While Beyoncé was wrapping up the album , several of its songs had leaked online . In efforts to prevent more tracks in the album from being spread illegally , as well as being a victim of bootlegging , Columbia Records , with high commercial expectations from the album , pulled the release of Dangerously in Love to June 24 , 2003 , two weeks ahead of the planned July 8 release . 
 Buyers who pre @-@ ordered the album online received links where they could download a song called " I Can 't Take No More " ; the promo lasted until the album 's release . On June 14 , 2003 , Beyoncé premiered songs from the album during her first solo concert and the pay @-@ per @-@ view TV special , " Ford Presents Beyoncé , Friends & Family , Live From Ford 's 100th Anniversary Celebration in Dearborn , Michigan " . By the night of the album 's release , Beyoncé 's concert was broadcast in more than twenty theaters across the United States . Kelly Rowland , Michelle Williams , Tyrese , Solange Knowles and girl group <unk> also performed in the show . Beyoncé also promoted the album by performing in television shows such as the Saturday Night Live , Late Show with David Letterman , The Today Show , The Early Show , and The View . 
 By April 2003 , Beyoncé 's management was choosing the album 's lead single between two songs . Sent to clubs , the song that would receive positive reception would be considered the lead single . Finally , " Crazy in Love " was released as the lead single off the album . With commercial success that included crossover music markets , the single spent eight consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 . " Baby Boy " followed , and received greater success than " Crazy in Love " . With its dominance on radio airplays , the single surpassed " Crazy in Love " ' s chart performance , remaining on the top spot for nine consecutive weeks . " Me , Myself and I " was released as the third single and " Naughty Girl " as fourth and last ; although the last two releases only reached the top five on the Hot 100 , they all attained immediate commercial success and helped the album earn multi @-@ platinum certifications . 
 = = Singles = = 
 " Crazy in Love " was released as the lead single in mid @-@ 2003 . It was lauded by critics who described it as " deliriously catchy " . The single reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 , the official US singles chart , based on heavy rotation alone . The same week the song reached number one , Dangerously in Love debuted on the Billboard 200 at number one as well . The substantial airplay and later retail sales of " Crazy in Love " facilitated it to dominate the chart , subsequently spending eight straight weeks atop the Hot 100 , making it Beyoncé 's first number @-@ one single in her solo career . According to Nielsen SoundScan , " Crazy in Love " was the most downloaded song in the United States for four consecutive weeks in July 2003 . It also became a success internationally reaching the top of the charts in Ireland and the United Kingdom . " Baby Boy " was released as the second single in August 2003 . It was well received by critics , who declared it a " high @-@ profile collaboration " that " bridges the gap between the genres of R & B and dancehall . " It ultimately reached the top of the Hot 100 . It reached the chart 's top spot eight weeks after its debut , and stayed there for nine consecutive weeks . It peaked in the top two in the United Kingdom . 
 " Me , Myself and I " was released as the album 's third single in October 2003 . It received generally positive response , being considered a typical sounding R & B ballad with a familiar theme , in which Beyoncé sings with passion . It reached the top ten in Canada and the United States . " Naughty Girl " was the fourth single from the album , released in March 2004 . The song was lauded by critics , who cited its sensual vibe and writing : " Beyoncé borrowed a portion of Donna Summer 's naughty classic " Love to Love You Baby " to create this celebration of sensual naughtiness . " Internationally , it became a top ten hit in the United States , Australia , Canada and New Zealand .

 Dangerously in Love received generally positive reviews from music critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 64 , based on 16 reviews . Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone viewed that it presents Beyoncé in two styles , one " far more flattering " than the other , and found the ballad @-@ oriented songs on the album least flattering , commenting that Beyoncé has " plenty of time " to develop the style maturely that would " [ make ] sense for her " . Entertainment Weekly 's Neil Drumming commented that the album validates Beyoncé 's " taste in innovation " . He also viewed that Beyoncé 's collaboration with various record producers explores new directions in contemporary music , doing more reinventing than revisiting . Like DeCurtis ' review , however , Drumming pointed out that " most of the disc 's missteps " are in its latter part . Slant Magazine 's Sal Cinquemani wrote that " [ Beyoncé ] is allowed more room to experiment vocally as a solo artist , exploring softer registers and <unk> on the coquettish persona that was only hinted at on Destiny 's Child tracks like ' Bootylicious . ' " . Steve Jones of USA Today stated , " Beyoncé succeeds by showing greater depth as a songwriter and broader range as a singer " . Blender 's Ben Ratliff complimented Beyoncé 's performance and stated , " She ’ s playing the cool @-@ hunter but covering the bases with seraphic arrangements of multiple voices . Her reach is remarkable " . Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters called it an " artistic leap " and wrote that it " finds Ms. B in the midst of a fully flowering womanhood and doing the best singing of her career " . 
 In a mixed review , Vibe magazine 's Jason King said that the album occasionally " sounds desperate to reach every demographic " . Kelefa Sanneh , writing in The New York Times , felt that it missed the harmonies Beyoncé had in Destiny 's Child records and that she is more effective " when she 's got a posse behind her " . Rob Fitzpatrick of NME called it " a cruel glimpse of a talent that occasionally blazes but is frustratingly inconsistent " . Uncut called its ballads " self @-@ pitying / self @-@ mythologising " , while Q stated , " She has good songs , but no great songs " . Los Angeles Times writer Natalie Nichols expressed that it " demonstrates vocal finesse [ ... ] But , especially on the ballads , [ Beyoncé ] often drags things out with diva acrobatics " . The Guardian 's Adam Sweeting wrote that " the desperate urge to cover every musical base from dancefloor to soul @-@ ballad means that there is barely a track here with any distinctive identity or even a tune " . In his consumer guide for The Village Voice , Robert Christgau cited " Yes " and " Baby Boy " as the album 's highlights and quippedly remarked , " Dangerously in Love ... with her daddy , the bonus cut reveals — as if we didn 't know . " He gave the album a one @-@ star honorable mention , indicating " a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like . " In a retrospective review , Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that " the first half is good enough to make Dangerously in Love one of the best mainstream urban R & B records released in 2003 , and makes a strong case that Beyoncé might be better off fulfilling this destiny instead of reuniting with Destiny " . 
 = = Accolades = = 
 Dangerously in Love and its singles earned Beyoncé numerous awards and nominations . In 2003 , Beyoncé was recognized as New Female Artist and New R & B Artist , among the four awards she won during the Billboard Music Awards . At the 2013 American Music Awards , the album was nominated in the category for Favorite Soul / R & B Album . It also received a nomination in the category for Best Album at the 2003 MOBO Awards . At the 46th Annual Grammy Awards , Beyoncé won Best Contemporary R & B Album along with four other awards for the album 's songs . With that feat , she tied with Alicia Keys , Norah Jones , and Lauryn Hill for most Grammys won by a female artist in one night . At the 2004 Brit Awards , the album was nominated in the category for Best International Album but lost to Justin Timberlake 's Justified . However , the singer herself won in the category for Best International Female Solo Artist . Dangerously in Love was also nominated in the category for Best Album at the 2004 MTV Europe Music Awards . 
 The 1,000th issue of Entertainment Weekly , which celebrated " the new classics " in the entertainment industry in the period from 1983 to 2008 , ranked Dangerously in Love nineteenth in the Top 100 Best Albums of the past 25 years . The album also ranked at number 183 on the list " 200 Definitive Albums That Shaped Rock and Roll " according to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .

 Dangerously in Love debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart , with sales of 317 @,@ 000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan . In its second week the album slid to number two with 183 @,@ 000 sold , behind Ashanti 's Chapter II . Although the album 's first @-@ week sales failed to match that of Survivor , which sold 663 @,@ 000 units in its debut in 2001 , Beyoncé earned the highest among Destiny 's Child members ' solo albums by best weeks : Rowland sold 77 @,@ 000 copies for Simply Deep in its strongest week while Williams earned 17 @,@ 000 copies for Heart to Yours in its top week . The album has been certified four @-@ time platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . Dangerously in Love remains as Beyoncé 's best @-@ selling album to date , with cumulative sales of 5 million copies in the United States as of June 2016 . 
 Internationally , Dangerously in Love had similar commercial reception . On July 12 , 2003 , Beyoncé became the first female artist ( and the fifth artist ever ) to top both the singles — with " Crazy in Love " — and albums chart simultaneously in the United States and the United Kingdom , following The Beatles , Simon & Garfunkel , Rod Stewart , and Men at Work . As of June 2011 , the album had sold over 1 @,@ 150 @,@ 000 copies in the United Kingdom , and the British Phonographic Industry has since certified the album four @-@ times platinum for sales of more than 1 @.@ 2 million units .

 With the release of Dangerously in Love and the combined commercial success of its singles , Beyoncé had established herself a viable solo artist . Rebecca Louie of the New York Daily News wrote that the success of Dangerously in Love brought Beyoncé into a " sultry solo star " who " blossomed from a girly group " , referring to Destiny 's Child . The album has also facilitated her to become one of the marketable artists in the industry . She appeared on the cover of numerous magazines , guested TV for promotions , and has signed lucrative commercial deals . Beyoncé signed to PepsiCo , a conglomerate beverage manufacturer , in 2003 , and appeared on several TV commercials for its products . 
 The creative output of the sessions for Dangerously in Love left several tracks ready for another album pressing . In late 2003 , Beyoncé planned to release a follow @-@ up album that would comprise left @-@ over songs from Dangerously in Love . The move was prompted when a P. Diddy @-@ collaboration called " Summertime " , a left @-@ over track from the album , was sent to radio stations and had received favorable response . 
 Meanwhile , the success of the album incited the public to infer that it signals Destiny 's Child to finally part ways , as had pop singer Justin Timberlake " could not go back to ' N Sync after tasting solo success " . However , Beyoncé said that their side projects were only " a brief diversion in the juggernaut that has become Destiny 's Child " . As time did not permit , Beyoncé 's musical aspirations were put on hiatus for her to concentrate on her Super Bowl performance , wherein she was slated to sing the U.S. national anthem , and the recording of Destiny 's Child 's fourth album , Destiny Fulfilled ; the group finally disbanded in 2005 . 
 After the group 's formal disbandment , Beyoncé recorded and released her second album , B 'Day , on September 4 , 2006 . The album gave Beyoncé her second number one in the United States , and its debut week sales exceeded that of Dangerously in Love , the former having sold 541 @,@ 000 units . Despite the album 's first two singles ' average commercial performance — neither of which reached the peak of the Billboard Hot 100 — its " handsome debut " was noted by Keith Caulfield of Billboard as having generated " by goodwill earned from the performance of [ Beyoncé 's ] smash first album Dangerously in Love .

 = Myriostoma = 
 Myriostoma is a fungal genus in the family Geastraceae . The genus is monotypic , containing the single species Myriostoma coliforme . It is an earthstar , so named because the spore @-@ bearing sack 's outer wall splits open into the shape of a star . The inedible fungus has a cosmopolitan distribution , and has been found in Africa , Asia , North and South America , and Europe , where it grows in humus @-@ rich forests or in woodlands , especially on well @-@ drained and sandy soils . A somewhat rare fungus , it appears on the Red Lists of 12 European countries , and in 2004 it was one of 33 species proposed for protection under the Bern Convention by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi . 
 The fruit body , initially shaped like a puffball , is encased within an outer covering that splits open from the top to form rays . These rays curve down to expose an inner papery spore case , which contains the fertile spore @-@ bearing tissue , the gleba . The fungus is unique among the earthstars in having a spore case that is supported by multiple stalks , and is perforated by several small holes suggestive of its common names salt @-@ shaker earthstar and pepperpot . It is the largest of the earthstar fungi , and reaches diameters of up to 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) . Its spherical spores have elongated warts that create a ridge @-@ like pattern on their surface . The spores are dispersed when falling water hits the outer wall of the spore sac , creating puffs of air that force the spores through the holes . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The species was first mentioned in the scientific literature by Samuel Doody in the second edition of John Ray 's Synopsis methodica Stirpium <unk> in 1696 . Doody briefly described the mushroom like so : " fungus <unk> coli instar <unk> , cum volva stellata " ( mushroom dusty , like a perforated colander , volva star @-@ shaped ) , and went on to explain that he found it in 1695 in Kent . 
 It was first described scientifically as a new species in 1776 from collections made in England by James Dickson , who named it Lycoperdon coliforme . He found it growing in roadside banks and hedgerows among nettles in Suffolk and Norfolk . Nicaise Auguste Desvaux first defined and published the new genus Myriostoma in 1809 , with the species renamed Myriostoma anglicum ( an illegitimate renaming ) . Christian Hendrik Persoon had previously placed the species in Geastrum in 1801 , while Samuel Frederick Gray would in 1821 describe the genus <unk> for it . Myriostoma coliforme received its current and final name when August Carl Joseph Corda moved Dickson 's name to Myriostoma in 1842 , replacing Desvaux 's name . 
 In North America the fungus began to be reported in the late 19th century , first from Colorado by Charles Horton Peck , and later from Florida , collected by Lucien Underwood in 1891 ; both findings were reported by Andrew Price Morgan in April 1892 . In 1897 , Melville Thurston Cook also reported having collected it the year before from " Albino Beach " . Curtis Gates Lloyd described <unk> simplex from a South African specimen in 1919 , but in 1942 , William Henry Long examined that specimen and concluded that it was a weathered spore sac of M. coliforme that had become detached from the outer star @-@ shaped exoperidium . This conclusion was confirmed in a later study of the material . 
 Myriostoma had been classified in the Geastraceae family until 1973 , when British mycologist Donald Dring placed it in the <unk> based on the presence of trabeculae ( stout columns that extend from the peridium to the central core of the fruit body ) in the gleba , and the absence of a true hymenium . In his 1989 monograph , Stellan Sunhede returned it to the Geastraceae . Molecular analysis of DNA sequences has confirmed the traditional belief that Myriostoma and Geastrum are closely related . 
 Václav Jan <unk> proposed a variety <unk> in 1958 , which has been sunk back into synonymy with the species . M. coliforme is the sole species in Myriostoma , making the genus monotypic . Because the original type material has been lost , in 1989 Sunhede suggested that Dickson 's illustration in his 1776 publication ( tab . III : 4a & b ) be used as the lectotype . 
 The specific epithet is derived from the Latin words <unk> , meaning " strainer " , and forma , meaning " shape " — Berkeley 's vernacular name " <unk> puff @-@ ball " also refers to a colander . Gray called it the " <unk> pill @-@ box " . The generic name is from the Greek words <unk> , meaning " countless " and <unk> , meaning " mouth " ( the source of the technical term stoma ) . The species is commonly known as the " salt @-@ and @-@ pepper shaker earthstar " or simply the " pepperpot " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit bodies start their development underground or buried in leaf debris , linked to a strand of mycelium at the base . As they mature , the exoperidium ( the outer tissue layer of the peridium ) splits open into 7 to 14 rays which curve backward ; this pushes the fruit body above the substrate . Fully opened specimens can reach dimensions of 2 – 12 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 4 @.@ 7 in ) from ray tip to tip . The rays are of unequal size , with tips that often roll back inward . They comprise three distinct layers of tissue . The inner pseudoparenchymatous layer ( so named for the resemblance to the tightly packed cells of plant parenchyma ) is fleshy and thick when fresh , and initially pale beige but darkening to yellow or brown as it matures , often cracking and peeling off in the process . The exterior mycelial layer , often matted with fine leaf debris or dirt , usually cracks to reveal a middle fibrous layer , which is made of densely packed hyphae 1 – 2 @.@ 5 μm wide . The base of the fruit body is concave to vaulted in shape , and often covered with adhering dirt . The roughly spherical spore sac ( endoperidium ) measures 1 – 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) in diameter , and is supported by a cluster of short columns shaped like flattened spheres . It is gray @-@ brown in color , and minutely roughened with small , lightly interconnected warts . There are several to many evenly dispersed mouths , the ostioles , mainly on the upper half of the endoperidium . They are roughly circular with fimbriate ( fringed ) edges . The inedible fruit bodies have no distinct taste , although dried specimens develop an odor resembling curry powder or bouillon cubes . 
 Like many earthstars , the fungus uses the force of falling raindrops to help disperse the spores , which are ejected in little bursts when objects ( such as rain ) strike the outer wall of the spore sac . The gleba is brown to grayish @-@ brown , with a cotton @-@ like texture that , when compressed , allows the endoperidium to flex quickly and create a puff of air that is forced out through the ostioles . This generates a cloud of spores that can then be carried by the wind . There are <unk> ( sterile structures that start at the base of the gleba and extend through it ) , which are usually not evident in the mature gleba , but apparent at the base of the spore sac . The <unk> are not connected to the ostioles , but rather , terminate within the gleba at some distance from them . The capillitia ( sterile strands within the gleba ) are long , slender , free , tapering , unbranched , and 2 – 5 μm thick , with thickened walls . The spores are spherical , nonamyloid , and are ornamented with irregularly shaped flaring protuberances up to 2 μm high . They measure 3 @.@ 9 – 4 @.@ 8 μm in diameter ( without ornamentation ) , and 5 @.@ 4 – 7 @.@ 0 μm including the ornamentation . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Myriostoma coliforme is a distinctive species easily characterized by its size — being the largest earthstar fungus — as well as the multiple openings on its spore sack and stalk supporting the sack . Historically , it was thought that the holes might have been a result of insects . This was discussed and rejected by Thomas Jenkinson Woodward in 1797 : 
 It has been doubted whether these mouths might not be accidental , and formed by insects after the expansion of the plant . But this ( not to mention their regularity , and that each is furrowed by its border of <unk> ) is clearly disproved , from the marks of the projections formed by the mouths being seen on the expanded rays , when freshly opened ... I have likewise found an abortive plant , in which the seed did not ripen ; but which had numerous projecting papillae on the head , where the mouths should have been formed . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Myriostoma is saprobic , deriving nutrients from decomposing organic matter . Fruit bodies grow grouped in well @-@ drained or sandy soil , often in the partial shade of trees . The species occurs in deciduous forests and mixed forests , gardens , along hedges and grassy road banks , and grazed grasslands . In the Northern Hemisphere , it tends to grow on well @-@ drained south @-@ facing slopes , while it prefers a similar habitat on north @-@ facing slopes in Australia . In Europe , its major habitat is riparian mixed forests dominated by Salix alba and Populus alba along the great rivers . In Hawaii , it has been collected at elevations above 2 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) where it appears to favor the <unk> ( Sophora chrysophylla ) forest . 
 The species is widespread , being known in its natural habitat from all five continents , but is not found in abundance . Myriostoma coliforme is rare in Europe , where it appears on the Regional Red Lists of 12 countries , and is one of 33 candidate species for listing in Appendix I of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats ( the " Bern Convention " ) . Although originally described from England , it was considered extinct in mainland Britain until it was found again in Suffolk in 2006 near Ipswich , one of its original localities — it had been last reported in the country in 1880 . The fungus is considered extinct in Switzerland . Its most northerly location is southern Sweden , although it is generally rare in northern Europe . It is similarly widespread but rarely encountered in North America , although there may be isolated localities , like New Mexico , where it is more abundant . In Australia , where its range is limited to the central New South Wales coast , it may have been introduced from exotic plant material . 
 = Dusky dolphin = 
 The dusky dolphin ( Lagenorhynchus obscurus ) is a dolphin found in coastal waters in the Southern Hemisphere . Its specific epithet is Latin for " dark " or " dim " . It is very closely genetically related to the Pacific white @-@ sided dolphin , but current scientific consensus holds they are distinct species . The dolphin 's range is patchy , with major populations around South America , southwestern Africa , New Zealand , and various oceanic islands , with some sightings around southern Australia and Tasmania . The dusky dolphin prefers cool currents and inshore waters , but can also be found offshore . It feeds on a variety of fish and squid species and has flexible hunting tactics . The dusky dolphin is known for its remarkable acrobatics , having a number of aerial behaviours . The status of the dolphin is unknown , but it has been commonly caught in gill nets . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 It is commonly thought that the dusky dolphin was first described by John Edward Gray in 1828 from stuffed skin and a single skull shipped from the Cape of Good Hope to the British Museum . Gray first described the species as Delphinus obscurus , with the subgenus Grampus in his 1828 <unk> Zoologica . Gray reported that the animal was captured around the Cape of Good Hope by a Captain <unk> ( often misspelt " Heaviside " ) and sent to the British Museum though the Royal College of Surgeons in 1827 . 
 However , Gray later wrote that a similar dolphin was described as Delphinus supercilious by French surgeons and naturalists René Primevère Lesson and Prosper Garnot from a specimen collected off the coast of Tasmania two years before his own classification . Gray classified D. supercilious as a junior synonym of his D. obscurus and credited Lesson and Garnot ( 1826 ) for their original description . Meanwhile , Charles Darwin also described what turned out to be this species as Delphinus <unk> from a specimen harpooned off Argentina in 1838 . The dusky dolphin was reclassified as <unk> obscurus in 1885 by British naturalist William Henry Flower , before gaining its current binomial name , Lagenorhynchus obscurus , from American biologist Frederick W. True in 1889 . 
 = = = Genetics = = = 
 The dusky dolphin and the Pacific white @-@ sided dolphin are considered phylogenetically related species . Some researchers have suggested they are the same species , but morphological and life @-@ history evidence shows otherwise . The two sister species diverged at around 1 @.@ 9 – 3 @.@ 0 million years ago . Recent analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicates that the genus Lagenorhynchus , as traditionally conceived , is not a natural ( monophyletic ) group . Another study finds that the dusky and the Pacific white @-@ sided dolphin form the sister group to the ( expanded ) genus <unk> . If this placement is accurate , a new genus name will need to be coined to accommodate these two species . 
 Dusky dolphins from Argentina and southwest Africa separated 2000 generations ago from an ancestral Atlantic population and subsequently diverged without much gene flow . Most populations have low genetic diversity , with the Peruvian population being an exception . Possible hybrids of dusky dolphins have been described with a long @-@ beaked common dolphin and a southern right whale dolphin . There are four subspecies classified ; ( Lagenorhynchus obscurus obscurus ) , ( L. o. <unk> ) , ( L. o. <unk> ) and ( L. o. <unk> ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The dusky dolphin is small to medium in length compared with other species in the family . There is significant variation in size among the different population areas . The largest dusky dolphins have been encountered off the coast of Peru , where they are up to 210 cm ( 6 feet ) in length and 100 kg ( 210 pounds ) in mass . The size for dusky dolphins in New Zealand have been recorded to be a length range of 167 – 178 cm and a weight range of 69 – 78 kg for females and a length range of 165 – 175 cm and a weigh range of 70 – 85 kg for males . 
 Almost no sexual dimorphism occurs in this species , although males have more curved dorsal fins with broader bases and greater surface areas . The back of the dolphin is dark grey or black , and the dorsal fin is distinctively two @-@ toned ; the leading edge matches the back in colour , but the trailing edge is a much lighter greyish white . The dusky dolphins has a long , light @-@ grey patch on its fore side leading to a short , dark @-@ grey beak . The throat and belly are white , and the beak and lower jaw are dark grey . Two blazes of white colour run back on the body from the dorsal fin to the tail . Right between the white areas remains a characteristic thorn @-@ shaped patch of dark colour , by which the species can easily be recognised . Aside from that , dusky dolphins may be confused with other members of their genus when observed at sea . It can be distinguished from the common dolphin , which has a more prominent and longer beak and yellow flank markings . The skull of a dusky dolphin has a longer and narrower rostrum than that of an hourglass dolphin or Peale 's dolphin of similar age and size .

The dolphins can be found off the coasts of South America , southwestern Africa , southern Australia and Tasmania , New Zealand , and some oceanic islands . Off South America , they range from southern Peru to Cape Horn in the west and from southern Patagonia to around 36 ° S in the east . Its range also includes the Falkland Islands . They are particularly common from Peninsula Valdes to Mar de Plata . In comparison , they are uncommon in the Beagle Channel and the inshore waters of the Tierra del Fuego region . 
 Dusky dolphins are found throughout New Zealand waters . The dolphin population in this area centres around East Cape and Cape Palliser on the North Island to Timaru and Oamaru on the South Island . They are especially common in the cold waters of the Southland and Canterbury currents . In Africa , the dusky dolphin ranges from Lobito Bay , Angola in the north to False Bay , South Africa in the south . Within Australian waters , dusky dolphins have been recorded in colder waters off Kangaroo Island , eastern Tasmania , and Bass Strait , although they are uncommon and those that are sighted there are possibly transients from New Zealand . They are also found around Campbell , Auckland , and Chatham in the western South Pacific , Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic and Île Amsterdam , and Île Saint @-@ Paul in the southern Indian Ocean . 
 = = Ecology and behaviour = = 
 Dusky dolphins prefer cool , upwelling waters , as well as cold currents . They largely live in inshore waters and can be found up to the outer continental shelf and in similar zones in offshore islands . They can move over great distances ( around 780 km ) , but have no well @-@ defined seasonal migrations . However , dolphins off Argentina and New Zealand make inshore and offshore seasonal and diurnal movements . In Argentina , dusky dolphins associate closely with southern right whales and South American sea lions . They have been found around bottlenose dolphins , but apparently do not interact with them , and may share feeding areas with Risso 's dolphins . They also associate with various seabirds , such as kelp gulls , cormorants , terns , shearwaters , petrels , and albatrosses . In New Zealand , dusky dolphins mingle with common dolphins . Dusky dolphins have also been observed with southern right whale dolphins and pilot whales off southwestern Africa . 
 = = = Vocalisations and echolocation = = = 
 In general , three different types of sounds are produced by dolphins ( and other toothed whales ) . These are click trains , which are made of numerous individual clicks , usually broadband signals that change from low value to high value quickly , burst pulses , which are individual clicks with high repetition and can be heard by humans only as a buzzing sound , and whistles , which are signals that are pure @-@ tones and whose frequency varies depending on the time . Dusky dolphins produce all three sounds , but most commonly make burst pulses . Whistling is more common when dusky dolphins mingle with other dolphin species such as common dolphins . Their echolocation signals are broadband and of short duration , much like those other whistle @-@ producing toothed whales . They tend to have bimodal frequency spectra which peak between 40 and 50 kHz at low frequency and between 80 and 110 kHz at high frequency . The species ' echolocation signals are about 9 – 12 dB lower than for the larger white @-@ beaked dolphin . 
 = = = Foraging and predation = = = 
 Dusky dolphins prey consume a variety of fish and squid species . Common fish species eaten include anchovies , lantern fish , pilchards , sculpins , hakes , horse mackerel , <unk> and red cod . They are generally coordinated hunters . Their very flexible foraging strategies can change depending on the environment . In certain parts of New Zealand , where deep oceanic waters meet the shore , dusky dolphins forage in deep scattering layers at night . They arrive at the hunting site individually , but form groups when in the layer . The dolphins use their echolocation to detect and isolate an individual prey . Groups of foraging dolphins tend to increase when the layer is near the surface and decrease when it descends . 
 When hunting in shallower waters in New Zealand and Argentina , dusky dolphins tend to forage during the day . The dolphins chase schools of fish or squid and herd them into stationary balls . They may control the school with light reflected from their white bellies . Dolphins herd prey against the surface , but also horizontally against the shore , a point of land , or the hull of a boat . During these times , dusky dolphins are believed to increase prey availability for other predators , including other dolphins , seabirds , sharks , and pinnipeds . In Argentina , dusky dolphins may use bird aggregations to locate and herd prey . Conversely , pinnipeds and sharks take advantage of the dolphin hunts . Dusky dolphins are themselves preyed on by killer whales and large sharks . Dolphins avoid killer whales by swimming into shallower water . Dusky dolphins are also susceptible to parasitism by certain nematode , cestode , and trematode species , mostly the genera <unk> and Anisakis , and Phyllobothrium <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . 
 = = = Social behaviour and reproduction = = = 
 Dusky dolphins live in a fission @-@ fusion society , with most group size increases occurring during foraging and decreases in group sizes occurring during resting and traveling . In the Golfo San José off the Valdes Peninsula , dolphins commonly switch between small traveling groups and large <unk> groups , and encounter a variety of associates . Studies of dolphins off Kaikoura , New Zealand , showed the dolphins normally live in large groups that split into smaller subgroups . These subgroups are composed of mating adults ( mating groups ) , mothers with calves ( nursery groups ) and nonbreeding adults . Dusky dolphins have a promiscuous mating system in which both males and females mate with multiple partners . Mating groups are generally made of around 10 males and a single female . These mating groups can be found in both shallow and deep water but more often gather near shore . 
 In the mating groups , the males pursue a female in high @-@ speed chases . Females seem to prefer males with great speed and agility rather than size , strength , or aggression . Females may extend the chase as long as possible so only the best male remains . Females may try to evade males that are not vigorous or lack social skill . Males also may form alliances to catch females . Unlike male bottlenose dolphins , male dusky dolphins cannot monopolise females . The time when female dusky dolphins first reproduce varies between regions . New Zealand dolphins first reproduce at about seven to years , with possibly six to seven years for Argentine dolphins . A study of dusky dolphins off the coast of Peru showed the reproductive cycle lasts around 28 @.@ 6 months , with mother dolphins pregnant for 12 @.@ 9 months , lactating for a further 12 months , and resting for 3 @.@ 7 months before the cycle begins again . During copulation , females tend to be on the top . As with all species where females mate with multiple partners , male dusky dolphins have large testicles for sperm competition . Dusky dolphins sometimes engage in sexual behaviour for reasons other than reproduction , perhaps for greeting , communication , or strengthening social bonds . Homosexual behaviour between males has been observed . Dolphins having sex for social reasons tend to be more relaxed . 
 Females with calves tend to gather in nursery groups in shallow water . Nursery groups likely provide mothers and calves more time to rest , which is important for both . While the behaviours of nursery groups vary by month , resting is the predominant behaviour during most months . The formation of nursery groups in shallow waters also allows members to hunt prey species that inhabit in these waters . Both adults and calves have been observed to chase and catch fish , and the adults may be teaching the calves how to hunt . In contrast to shallower waters , hunting in deep water at night may be too dangerous for calves . Calves are particularly vulnerable to predators like killer whales and use of shallow water by nursery groups may be a way to avoid predation . Nursery groups tend to avoid mating groups . Adult males in these groups will aggressively herd and chase females . They can separate calves from their mothers and harass them , as well . Calves may also become even more vulnerable to predators as they become exhausted and disoriented . Mother dolphins may look after calves that are not their own . 
 = = = Aerial behaviour = = = 
 Dusky dolphins perform a number of aerial displays , including leaps , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , spins , and <unk> . They also perform head @-@ over @-@ tail leaps which have been called the most " acrobatic " of the displays . A headfirst re @-@ entry is performed when a dolphin leaps entirely water and positions its back in a curve while it flips the tail to land back in the water head @-@ first . " Humping " is similar , except the snout and tail remain in the water when the dolphin is the arch . Leaps , head @-@ over @-@ tail leaps , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and spins are often done over and over again . Young dusky dolphins apparently are not born with the ability to perform the leaps and must learn to master each one . Calves appear to learn the leaps in this order : noisy leaps , head first re @-@ entries , coordinated leaps , and acrobatic leaps . Adults may perform different leaps in different contexts , and calves may independently learn how to perform leaps , but learn when to perform these when interacting others .

 = = = Status = = = 
 The dusky dolphin , protected in much of its range , is listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN because ; " ... assessment of global population status is not possible with the currently available estimates of abundance and removals . The subpopulation off Peru has probably been overexploited , but present data do not allow estimation of present decline " . Dusky dolphins may fall victim to the small cetacean fisheries of Peru and Chile . The expansion of these fisheries could have started in Peru when the <unk> fishery collapsed in 1972 . Dolphins have also been caught in gill nets in New Zealand , but catches appear to have dropped since the 1970s and 1980s . In Peru , dusky dolphins are killed in large numbers ( 10 @.@ 000 @-@ 15 @.@ 000 per year ) and used as shark bait or for human consumption . The dolphins are also thought to have been harpooned off South Africa , but the numbers are not considered large . 
 The dusky dolphin is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals ( CMS ) as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co @-@ operation organised by tailored agreements . 
 = = = Mussel farming = = = 
 The effect of mussel farming on dusky dolphins has been studied in Admiralty Bay , New Zealand . Dusky dolphins are commonly seen in this area , which is also where the greatest density of farming activity is proposed . Apparently , dolphins rarely enter existing farms , and when they do , they usually swim quickly up the lanes and between rows of lines and floats . 
 = = = Tourism = = = 
 Dusky dolphins are popular attractions for whale @-@ watching tours . Since 1997 , dolphin @-@ watching activities have increased in Patagonia , with dusky dolphins ( along with Commerson 's dolphins ) as the target species . Tourists interested in seeing dusky dolphins grew from 1 @,@ 393 in 1997 to 1 @,@ 840 in 2000 . Encounters with dolphins increased from 25 % during 1999 to 90 % in 2001 . Dolphin watching in this areas started as an alternative to whale watching , which was mostly based on that of the southern right whale . Dusky dolphin watching is also popular in New Zealand , whose dolphin @-@ watching industry begin in the late 1980s , as a side attraction to sperm whale watching . Whale and dolphin watching tours have grown with around 75 permitted dolphin tour operators . New Zealand has several locations to view and swim with dusky dolphins , notably in Kaikoura and Marlborough Sounds . 
 While dusky dolphin tourism is a larger industry in New Zealand than it is in Argentina , the effects of tourism on the dolphins seem to be lower in the former than the latter . New Zealand tours are operated under permits , and are limited in number and have conditions and guidelines related to approach procedures and swim operations . By contrast , no direct regulation of dolphin watching is done in Argentina . As such , dolphin activities are often disturbed by touring vessels .

 = Bellaire , Texas = 
 Bellaire is a city in southwest Harris County , Texas , United States , within the Houston – Sugar Land – Baytown metropolitan area . As of the 2010 U.S. Census , the city population was 16 @,@ 855 and is surrounded by the cities of Houston and West University Place . 
 Bellaire is known as the " City of Homes , " owing to its mostly residential character ; however , there are offices along the 610 Loop within the city limits . 
 = = History = = 
 Bellaire was founded in 1908 by William Wright Baldwin , who was the president of the South End Land Company . Baldwin , a native of Iowa , was well known as the vice president of the Burlington Railroad . Bellaire was founded on what was part of William Marsh Rice 's 9 @,@ 449 acres ( 38 @.@ 24 km2 ) ranch . Baldwin surveyed the eastern 1 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 @.@ 0 km2 ) of the ranch into small truck farms . He named those farms " Westmoreland Farms " . Baldwin started Bellaire in the middle of " Westmoreland Farms " to serve as a residential neighborhood and an agricultural trading center . South End Land Company advertised to farmers in the Midwestern United States . Baldwin stated that the town was named " Bellaire " , or " Good Air " for its breezes " . Bellaire may have been named after Bellaire , Ohio , a town served by one of Baldwin 's rail lines . 
 Six miles of prairie was a buffer zone between Houston and Bellaire . Originally the town was bounded by Palmetto , First , Jessamine , and Sixth ( now Ferris ) Streets . In 1910 Edward Teas , a horticulturist , moved his nursery to Bellaire from Missouri so Teas could implement Sid Hare 's landscaping plans . Bellaire was incorporated as a city with a general charter in 1918 , ten years after its founding . Bellaire had a population of 200 at the time . Because of the 1918 incorporation , Houston did not incorporate Bellaire 's territory into its city limits , while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated . 
 Bellaire 's population had reached 1 @,@ 124 in 1940 . After 1940 , Bellaire had a rapid population explosion in the post @-@ World War II building boom . On December 31 , 1948 , the city of Houston had annexed the land around the city of Bellaire , stopping the city of Bellaire 's land growth . Bellaire remained independent of Houston ; Bellaire adopted a home rule charter with a council @-@ manager government in April 1949 . By 1950 the city 's residents had numbered 10 @,@ 150 . Bellaire High School was established in 1955 . 
 According to a Bellaire resident quoted in the Houston Post , prior to 1992 , the tax base of the city of Bellaire had been decreasing . After neighbor West University Place eased restrictions on developers , new houses were constructed in West University Place , and the city gained a larger tax base . Bellaire decided to also liberalize its development restrictions to allow for new development by streamlining its no @-@ growth building permit process . According to Karl Lewis , a vice president and sales manager at John Daugherty Realtors , when the prices of West University Place land reached about $ 20 per square foot , area home buyers began to consider Bellaire , which had an average price of $ 10 – 12 per square foot . Don Stowers of the Houston Press said that Bellaire and West University Place had " comparable " attributes such as independent fire and police departments , zoning , recreation facilities and parks , and schools " among the best in Houston . " Michael Blum , president of Blum & Associates Realty , said " Bellaire is a bargain . " Blum added that Bellaire was affordable compared to similar American neighborhoods and that Bellaire had proximity to business districts , " excellent " municipal services , and " superior " schools . Affluent families increasingly moved to Bellaire . The price of an average house in Bellaire increased from $ 75 @,@ 000 to $ 500 @,@ 000 from 1986 to 2006 . 
 In 2002 the City of Bellaire attempted to acquire all or part of the 10 acres ( 4 @.@ 0 ha ) Teas Nursery , Bellaire 's oldest business and the oldest nursery in Greater Houston , for park development . The company fought the city 's take @-@ over attempt . During that year the owners of Teas sold 5 acres ( 2 @.@ 0 ha ) at the rear of the property to Lovett Homes , a home developer . Frank Liu , the owner of Lovett Homes , said that it had an option to buy the remaining 5 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 m2 ) . When the City of Bellaire denied a <unk> application sent by Teas Nursery , in June 2002 the nursery filed a lawsuit against the city and its zoning commission . In 2005 the lawsuit was settled out of court . 
 During the Hurricane Rita evacuation , a bus filled with residents from Brighton Gardens , a nursing home in Bellaire , caught on fire and exploded in the city of Wilmer . The September 23 , 2005 , explosion killed 24 people out of the 38 residents and employees in the bus . The resulting lawsuit was settled in June 2009 . On March 23 , 2008 , a tour bus carrying Tejano singer Emilio Navaira crashed in Bellaire . By 2008 , an increasing number of houses sold for over $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . 
 On December 31 , 2008 , Bellaire police officers confronted Robbie Tolan , the son of former Major League Baseball player Bobby Tolan , in the driveway of his house at the 800 block of Woodstock . Officers suspected Tolan , who was unarmed , of stealing a sports utility vehicle in the driveway and shot Tolan in the chest ; Tolan 's family owned the vehicle . Tolan was hospitalized with injuries to one lung and a liver . The incident sparked allegations of racial profiling . Members of minority groups reported that Bellaire police racially profiled people . In 2002 , José Cruz , Jr . , son of baseball player José Cruz , was stopped since his vehicle was missing a front license plate . He was arrested by Bellaire police and spent one night in jail after Bellaire law enforcement told him that he had a warrant for his arrest . The Houston Chronicle said that the Bellaire police decision to arrest Cruz was a mistake . In January 2009 , Cruz accused the police of racial profiling . Mayor Cindy Siegel said that she was unaware of racial profiling by police . Siegel announced that the city will investigate racial profiling and hire an independent consultant to look at traffic stop data . The local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) branch said that it established a pact with the City of Bellaire ; people may report civil rights violations from Bellaire Police to the branch if the people do not wish to contact the City of Bellaire . However , the NAACP branch has not yet provided the city with any civil rights violations . On April 6 , 2009 , a Harris County grand jury indicted Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton , the police officer , for aggravated assault by a public servant . If convicted , Cotton could face up to life in prison . In addition the family sued the police department and the police officer . The upcoming trial in Harris County District Court on criminal felony charges against Cotton began on January 25 , 2010 . Jury selection was scheduled to begin on May 3 , 2010 . The officer was found not guilty in his criminal trial in May 2010 . 
 Teas Nursery closed in 2010 ; the company president , Tom Teas , intended for the property to be redeveloped into single @-@ family houses . The Teas Nursery business was either going to move to a new location or be liquidated . In December the Rubenstein family bought the Teas property ; the family planned to donate it to the City of Bellaire for community purposes . The Teas property has two historic buildings . Scott Rubenstein , who handled negotiations for the Rubenstein family , described the Teas lot as " the last largely undeveloped tract in the city and , frankly , in the inner loop of the city of Houston where you can do something that can be used by people from all around the city . " Mayor of Bellaire Cindy Seigel said " I am just thrilled we ’ ll be able to preserve a historical property that is an important piece of Bellaire ’ s history . " 
 In January 2010 Siegel announced that she would oppose a plan to locate a permanent , privately funded Houston Dynamo stadium at the intersection of South Rice and <unk> , near Bellaire . In April 2010 it was announced that the Dynamo stadium , now known as BBVA Compass Stadium , would be built in East Downtown Houston .

 Bellaire 's housing lots are 75 feet ( 23 m ) by 130 feet ( 40 m ) , allowing for houses larger than those that could be built on typical 50 feet ( 15 m ) by 120 feet ( 37 m ) West University Place lots . A Bellaire lot can accommodate a house with a detached garage and a swimming pool , while the typical West University Place lot could accommodate a newly constructed Georgian house described by Don Stowers of the Houston Post as " lot @-@ hugging . " The more spacious and inexpensive housing lots prompted area home seekers to consider Bellaire . 
 The original Bellaire housing stock typically consisted of 3 bedroom , 1 bathroom post @-@ World War II houses described by Stowers as " smallish . " Because of the attributes , developers did not hesitate to tear these houses down and build new houses . Some individuals chose to renovate their houses instead of having them torn down . Many individuals who would otherwise renovate the houses reconsidered their decisions as the land value increased . In some cases the land value was higher than the value of the structure on the lot . Some subdivisions had larger houses , particularly the Carroll subdivision south of Bellaire Boulevard and the Braeburn Country Club Estates subdivision between Chimney Rock and Rice . Many of the houses in those subdivisions were built in the 1950s and early 1960s , and many were on .5 acres ( 0 @.@ 20 ha ) lots . Karl Lewis , the vice president and sales manager of John Daugherty Realtors , said that many of the houses were " still quite attractive " and " similar to the large Tanglewood homes . " In 1992 smaller lots in Bellaire were about $ 50 @,@ 000 ( $ <unk> @.@ 49 in today 's money ) and up , while larger lots were $ 300 @,@ 000 ( $ <unk> @.@ 96 in today 's money ) to $ 500 @,@ 000 ( $ <unk> @.@ 93 in today 's money ) . 
 In a 2007 Houston Press article John Nova Lomax , a journalist , said that parts of Bellaire 's downtown had " a certain raffish 1950s charm – the Bellaire Broiler Burger , for example – but it ’ s boring . " Lomax stated in a 2008 Houston Press article that , due to the growth and dominance of Houston , municipal enclaves with their own services , including Bellaire , " are little more than glorified neighborhoods . " 
 Many Bellaire streets , such as " Holly , " " Holt , " " Maple , " and " Pine , " are named after trees . The word " Holt " means a small grove or a forest of trees . 
 One community in Bellaire , South dale , was developed by William G. Farmington , the developer of Tanglewood . South dale was originally developed in the late 1940s with two bedroom houses . The houses were marketed to World War II veterans . The houses were about four times less expensive than the around $ 25 @,@ 000 @-@ each ( $ <unk> @.@ 76 in today 's money ) <unk> wood houses .

 Zoning and land use controversies , common throughout Bellaire 's history , resulted in the 1977 recall of the mayor and three council members . The City of Bellaire voted against banning smoking in bars and restaurants on Monday January 15 , 2007 . Mayor Cindy Siegel and Pat McLaughlan , one council member , voted for the ban , while the other five members , including Peggy Faulk , voted against the ban . The National Restaurant Association asked Bellaire to consider adopting a smoking ban to put it in sync with the City of Houston , which adopted a similar ordinance in 2005 . In December 2009 the city voted to ban texting while driving . Bans of texting while driving were passed in Bellaire and West University Place , Texas within hours of one another .

 In Bellaire 's early history , Bellaire Boulevard and a historic street car line connected Bellaire to Houston . The street car line , which ran a four @-@ mile ( 6 km ) stretch from central Bellaire to Houston 's Main Street , started construction in 1909 . The streetcar line consisted of one railway track and an overhead electric wire . A waiting pavilion and a turnaround loop were located at the terminus in Bellaire . The Houston Electric Company had simultaneously constructed a south end line from Eagle Avenue to what is now Fannin Street to connect to the Bellaire Boulevard line . Service , with one required transfer at Eagle Avenue , began on December 28 , 1910 . The streetcar was nicknamed the " <unk> Trolley " . On September 26 , 1927 , the trolley line was abandoned and replaced by a bus line . This was due to frequent derailments caused by a worn @-@ out track and the advent of the automobile . In 1985 , a similar streetcar was acquired in Portugal and brought to Bellaire for permanent display .

 = = = = History = = = = 
 Bellaire 's first school opened in 1909 ; the school moved to a new site in 1914 and an addition opened in 1927 ; when the addition opened the school was renamed " Condit . " Horn opened in 1949 , Pershing opened in 1927 , Bellaire High School opened in 1955 . Pin Oak opened in 2002 . Pershing 's current campus opened in January 2007 . The current Horn and Lovett buildings were scheduled to open in August 2011 . The rebuilds of Horn , Lovett , and Herod Elementary of Houston together had a cost of $ 49 million and were a part of a $ 1 billion bond program approved by HISD voters in 2007 . 
 Maud W. Gordon Elementary School in Bellaire does not have a zoning boundary ; before 2012 it drew excess students from apartments west of Bellaire , in Houston , to relieve other schools in Houston west of Bellaire such as Benavidez , Cunningham , Elrod , and Milne . From its opening to 1953 to 1983 Gordon served as a neighborhood school . After its closure Gordon temporarily housed the Post Oak School and later served as administrative offices . It re @-@ opened as a relief school in 1988 for Elrod and Cunningham schools . It was scheduled to re @-@ open in September of that year . 
 On April 29 , 1992 , during an attendance boundary hearing committee for Southwest Houston , residents of a small portion of Bellaire zoned to Cunningham Elementary School , a school in Houston that was one block away from the city limits of Bellaire , advocated for a rezoning to Condit Elementary School , a facility in the City of Bellaire that was about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) away from that section . Condit was about 50 % White and had a middle class student body while Cunningham was 95 % Hispanic . On May 21 , 1992 , the HISD board voted to rezone that portion to Condit . 
 Around the early 1990s portions of Bellaire west of the 610 Loop were zoned to Jane Long Middle School , while portions inside the 610 Loop were zoned to Pershing . During that decade , the Bellaire Area School Improvement Committee , or BASIC , was formed to improve the reputation of HISD in Bellaire and to improve Bellaire area schools . The committee opened after HISD 's failed attempt to acquire property in Bellaire for the West University relief school . An attempt to buy land at <unk> Street at Newcastle Drive in the City of Bellaire for a school to relieve West University Elementary School failed since City of Bellaire officials and parents living in Bellaire complained when they learned that they would not be zoned to the new school while losing what Tim Fleck of the Houston Press described as " a prime chunk of taxable property . " 
 After its formation , BASIC installed a gifted and talented magnet at Jane Long , a school which Donald R. McAdams , a former HISD school board member and author of Fighting to Save Our Urban <unk> and Winning ! : Lessons from Houston , described as a school that was " unacceptable " to Bellaire residents since it was less than 10 % white . McAdams added that even with the new program , to many parents in Bellaire , Long was " never going to be acceptable " due to the overwhelming Hispanic presence . Therefore , there was a proposal to convert Gordon into a small middle school for Bellaire . The school would have space for about 500 students and would be at least 50 % White , so it was popular among many Bellaire residents , particularly those outside of the 610 Loop . However those inside the 610 Loop did not want to lose access to Pershing , a full service middle school that was about 40 % White . An attendance boundary committee for at HISD met from December 1992 to March 1993 . McAdams wrote that the committee was " an all @-@ out war " between the two sides . In February 1993 pro @-@ Gordon persons argued that HISD should purchase a commercial building north of Long and renovate it into an elementary school which would relieve Gordon Elementary and other overcrowded are schools . McAdams wrote that the staff members of HISD superintendent Frank <unk> " liked the idea , but unfortunately , on close examination the building proved to be inadequate . " In April 1993 the HISD board declared that the Gordon campus would continue to be an elementary school . McAdams wrote that the Gordon supporters and many Bellaire residents were " furious " .

 Alien Spidy is a platformer video game for Microsoft Windows , Macintosh , Xbox 360 ( through Xbox Live Arcade ) , and PlayStation 3 ( through PlayStation Network ) . It was developed by Enigma Software Productions and published by Kalypso Media . Players control an extraterrestrial spider who has crash @-@ landed on Earth , as he seeks to repair his spacecraft and rescue a fellow extraterrestrial spider . 
 Announced on 8 November 2011 , Alien Spidy was published on 20 March 2013 for the Xbox 360 , Microsoft Windows , and Macintosh , and on 8 May 2013 for the PlayStation 3 . It received mixed to negative reviews upon release ; critics praised the game 's aesthetics but found the gameplay frustrating due to imprecise controls and an unforgiving level of difficultly that hampered progression through the game . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Alien Spidy is a physics @-@ based platformer video game . Players control the eponymous Spidy , an extraterrestrial spider , and navigate him through a series of levels that are filled with deadly obstacles . Spidy can run and jump , and has the ability to shoot a web , allowing him to grapple and swing from object to object within the environment . Interspersed throughout each level are a large number of orbs , which Spidy can collect to score points . Finishing the level quickly , collecting a large number of orbs , collecting several orbs in quick succession , and finding score multipliers all increase the player 's score for that level . Players can also lose points by dying , collecting certain orbs that decrease the player 's score , or going for too long without collecting an orb . Players earn between one and five stars on each level , based on their score . Levels are grouped into several stages , including a forest , a pond , a cave system , and outer @-@ space . In order to progress from one stage to the next , players must collect a certain number of stars . Players can collect special power @-@ up orbs scattered throughout levels . These orbs allow Spidy to perform feats he is otherwise incapable of , including traveling underwater and jumping to extreme heights . There are 69 levels in the game , and most of them take between 90 seconds and three minutes .

 = = Development = = 
 On 8 November 2011 , the game was announced in a press release , with Enigma Software Productions as the developer and Kalypso Media as the publisher . The press release indicated that the game would be released in the second quarter of 2012 . 
 Alien Spidy was advertised as a PlayStation Vita game early in its development history , with Sony using gameplay footage of the game on the Vita at a presentation at Gamescom 2011 . The game was never released on that platform , however . In an interview , Enigma Software CEO Daniel Parente claimed that the game was developed for all major platforms , and after bringing Kalypso Media on board as a publisher , the latter chose which platforms to release the game on , and when . The project manager at Kalypso Media for Alien Spidy , Andrew McKerrow , noted that the developer attempted to secure a publisher by pitching the game on a large number of platforms . In a separate interview with Daniel Parente , conducted in October 2012 , Enigma Software 's CEO called the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 the game 's lead platforms , stating that the game was " designed to be played with a gamepad " . 
 It took eight months for Enigma to build the physics behind the web @-@ based grapple and swing game mechanic . During early builds of the game , the motion was slower , but the development team sped up the movement , feeling it was truer to the character . The Sonic the Hedgehog series served as an inspiration for the game 's pace . Significant effort was put into creating the game 's visual style and making Spidy a relatable , charismatic character . Daniel Parente cited Limbo , Braid , and <unk> as influences for the game 's aesthetics . Comics and cartoons served as influences for Spidy 's design . The character was given a pair of large yellow eyes , which allowed the character to emote . Two of the legs were removed , bringing the total from eight to six , which Andrew McKerrow described as an effort to avoid triggering the fears of people with arachnophobia and " make the character a little more friendly looking and little less creepy " . It was only after making these changes to Spidy that the developers decided to make Spidy an extraterrestrial , as that would justify the character design 's deviations from regular spiders . 
 The game was delayed several times . In August 2012 , the website XBLA Fans reported that the game would be delayed into the fall of that year . By October , a preview on the gaming website <unk> listed the release date as 31 December 2012 . The game was released on the Xbox 360 , Microsoft Windows , and Macintosh on 20 March 2013 , and was released on the PlayStation 3 on 8 May 2013 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Alien Spidy received mixed to negative reviews upon release . At Metacritic , a video game review aggregator , the Xbox 360 version of the game received an average score of 55 out of 100 , based on 19 reviews . 
 The game 's visuals were praised by reviewers . GamesRadar 's Lorenzo Veloria opined that " <unk> characters , beautiful visuals , and upbeat music stand out as the high points of Alien Spidy " . A large number of reviewers called the game and its characters " cute " . While a few of the reviewers praised the game 's music , Jeremy Peeples of Hardcore Gamer found that it lacked staying power . He noted , however , that the music could be muted without also muting the sound effects , allowing people to play their own music . 
 Critics near universally took issue with the game 's controls . Critics found that the webs that they shot did not go where they wanted them to go , and multiple reviewers described navigation as " trial and error " . Reviewers also found that they could not always jump when they wanted to , and one reviewer found that power @-@ ups failed to activate when she wanted them to . Reviewers also complained that it was extremely difficult to get enough stars to progress from one stage to the next , forcing players to replay the same levels over and over again . Because points are subtracted each time Spidy dies , the problems with the control scheme exacerbate how difficult it is to get enough stars to progress . 
 Opinions on the game 's mid @-@ level checkpoint system were mixed . Matt Cullen of Canadian Online Gaming noted that the checkpoints meant that players were not sent too far back into the level after each death , saving time . Official Xbox Magazine 's Taylor Cocke , however , noted that the checkpoints save players ' point progress , meaning that players would have to start the level over if their performance wasn 't good enough before they reached the checkpoint . 
 = Australian raven = 
 The Australian raven ( Corvus coronoides ) is a passerine bird in the genus Corvus native to much of southern and northeastern Australia . Measuring 46 – 53 centimetres ( 18 – 21 in ) in length , it has all @-@ black plumage , beak and mouth , as well as strong grey @-@ black legs and feet . The upperparts are glossy , with a purple , blue or green sheen , and its black feathers have grey bases . The Australian raven is distinguished from the Australian crow species by its throat hackles , which are prominent in adult birds . Older adult individuals have white irises , younger adults have a white irises with an inner blue rim , while younger birds have dark brown irises until fifteen months of age , and hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months . Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield described the Australian raven in 1827 , its species name highlighting its similarity with the carrion crow ( C. corone ) . Two subspecies are recognised , which differ slightly in calls and are quite divergent genetically . 
 The preferred habitat is open woodland and transitional zones . It has adapted well to urban environments and is a common city bird in Sydney , Canberra and Perth . An omnivorous and opportunistic feeder , it eats a wide variety of plant and animal material , as well as food waste from urban areas . In eastern Australia its range is strongly correlated with the presence of sheep , and it has been blamed for killing lambs . However , this is very rare , and the raven most often scavenges for afterbirth and stillborn animals as well as newborn lamb faeces . The Australian raven is territorial , with pairs generally bonding for life . Breeding takes place between July and September , with almost no variation across its range . The nest is a bowl @-@ shaped structure of sticks sited high in a tree , or occasionally in a man @-@ made structure such as a windmill or other building . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The Australian raven was first described by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827 , when they reported George Caley 's early notes on the species from the Sydney district . Its specific epithet coronoides " crow @-@ shaped " is derived from the Greek corone / <unk> " crow " and eidos / <unk> " shape " or " form " . The two naturalists regarded the Australian raven as very similar in appearance to the carrion crow ( C. corone ) of Europe , though they noted it was larger with a longer bill . They did not give it a common name . The location where the type specimen was collected is not recorded , but thought to be in the Parramatta district . Christian Ludwig Brehm described Corvus affinis in 1845 , later determined to be this species . In his 1865 Handbook to the Birds of Australia , John Gould recognised only one species of corvid in Australia , Corvus australis , which he called the white @-@ eyed crow . He used Johann Friedrich Gmelin 's 1788 name , which predated Vigors and Horsfield 's description . In 1877 Richard Bowdler Sharpe recognised two species , but recorded that the feather bases of the type specimen of C. coronoides were white . He named C. coronoides as the " crow " and C. australis ( as <unk> australis ) the " raven " . Scottish naturalist William Robert Ogilvie @-@ Grant corrected this in 1912 after re @-@ examining the type specimen , clarifying the species as C. coronoides ( raven , and incorporating little and forest ravens ) and C. cecilae ( Torresian crow ) . 
 Gregory Mathews described the western subspecies <unk> in 1912 , naming it the southwestern crow and noting that it was smaller than the nominate subspecies . He called C. coronoides coronoides the eastern crow , listing its range as New South Wales , and described what is now the Australian crow as another subspecies , C. coronoides cecilae , calling it the north @-@ western crow and recording its range as northwestern Australia . In the same work he listed the raven as Corvus marianae , with a type specimen from Gosford and listing its range as New South Wales . He listed the little raven and forest raven as subspecies . Mathews had erected C. marianae in 1911 as the name after declaring Corvus australis Gould to be preoccupied ; French @-@ American ornithologist Charles Vaurie acted as First Revisor under Article 24 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) Code and discarded C. australis as a junior homonym — in 1788 , Gmelin had used the same binomial name to describe the black <unk> — to preserve the stability of the name . This has been followed by later authors . 
 German ornithologist Erwin Stresemann lumped all Australian corvids plus other species as far as India into a single species , C. coronoides , as he believed there was intergradation between all characteristics such as iris colour , colour of feather bases and plumage . This was hotly disputed by Mathews . The official <unk> checklist listed three species ( Australian raven , Torresian crow and little crow ) , with the little raven recognised as a fourth species in 1967 and forest raven in 1970 . <unk> described C. <unk> in 1943 from a single specimen , now thought to have been an unusual Australian raven or an Australian raven / Torresian crow hybrid . 
 Alternative names sometimes seen include southern raven , southern crow and Kelly , the last thought to have alluded to the Kelly Gang , though did not appear until the 1920s . Southern crow was considered by the <unk> before Australian raven was adopted as the official name for the species in 1926 . The term " crow " is colloquially applied to any or all species of Australian corvid . The Australian raven was called <unk> by the local Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney Basin . 
 = = = Evolution and systematics = = = 
 The Australian raven 's closest relatives are the other two species of raven occurring in Australia : the little raven and forest raven . The Australian raven is also somewhat closely related to the Torresian and little crow , although not as closely related as it is to the other raven species . Initial single gene genetic analysis of the genus using mitochondrial DNA showed the three raven species to belong to one lineage and the two crows to another . The genetic separation between species is small and there was a suggestion the little raven may be nested within the Australian raven , though the authors conceded more genetic work was needed . Subsequent multigene analysis using nuclear DNA by <unk> and colleagues in 2012 showed the eastern and western subspecies of the Australian raven to form two clades , almost as genetically distinct as the forest and little raven are to each other . This led the authors to propose that the subspecies be recognised as separate species . 
 Ian Rowley proposed that the common ancestor of the five species diverged into a tropical crow and temperate raven sometime after entering Australia from the north , which molecular evidence indicates occurred in the early Pliocene epoch around 4 million years ago . The raven diverged into the ancestor of the forest and little ravens in the east and Australian raven in the west , this split occurring around 2 million years ago in the early Pleistocene . As the climate became cooler and dryer , the aridity of central Australia split them entirely . Furthermore , the eastern birds diverged into nomadic little ravens and , in forested refuges , forest ravens . As the climate eventually became warmer , the western birds spread eastwards and almost outcompeted forest ravens on mainland Australia . Rowley noted that the western subspecies of the Australian raven had features intermediate between the eastern subspecies of Australian and little ravens . 
 Two subspecies are recognised : 
 C. c. coronoides , the nominate or eastern subspecies , is found across most of eastern Australia . Its range is also highly correlated with the presence of sheep . This is thought to be because of the frequency of dead animals , which can be an important source of food . Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation , and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies , which appears static . The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread . 
 C. c. <unk> , the western subspecies , occurs from the head of the Great Australian Bight in South Australia westwards into Western Australia where its northern limits are Shark Bay and the mulga @-@ eucalypt boundary line . It is less specialised in its habitat , as it does not share its distribution with the little raven , and does not appear to correlate with the range of sheep . The western subspecies has a slightly lower @-@ pitched call than that of the eastern subspecies , with similarities to calls of the little raven . Of smaller size overall , it has a more slender bill and shorter hackles . There is otherwise no difference in plumage . Intermediate birds are found in the Eyre Peninsula , Gawler Ranges and vicinity of Lake Eyre in South Australia .

 Measuring 46 – 53 cm ( 18 – 21 in ) in length with a 100 cm ( 39 in ) wingspan and weighing around 650 g ( 1 @.@ 43 lb ) , the adult Australian raven is an all black @-@ bird with a black beak , mouth and tongue and sturdy black or grey @-@ black legs and feet . The tibia is fully feathered and the tarsus is long , and the feet large and strong . It has white irises . The plumage is glossy with a blue @-@ purple to blue @-@ green sheen , greenish over the ear coverts , depending on light . The underparts are not glossy . The Australian raven has throat feathers ( hackles ) that are lanceolate with rounded tips , while the other four species of Australian corvids have bifurcate tips , though this can be difficult to see in the field . The hackles are also longer than those of the other four species ; when they are raised ( such as when the bird is calling ) , they give the bird an unusual bearded appearance . The upper third of the upper mandible , including the nares and nasal groove , is covered with bristles , which can be up to 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) long . The heavy @-@ set beak is tipped with a slight hook , and is longer than the bird 's head . The wings are long and broad , with the longest of its ten primary feathers ( usually the seventh but occasionally the eighth ) almost reaching the end of the tail when the bird is at rest . The tail is rounded or wedge @-@ shaped . The Australian raven can be distinguished from the two species of crow occurring in Australia by the grey base of the feathers , which is white in the latter species . The demarcation between pale and black regions on the feather is gradual in the ravens and sharply delineated in the crows . Feather bases are not normally visible when observing birds in the field , but can sometimes be seen on a windy day if the feathers are ruffled . Unlike the other four species , the Australian raven has a bare patch of skin under , and extending to beside , the bill . This can be hard to discern in the field . The three species of raven are more heavily set with a broader chest than the two crow species , with the forest raven the <unk> of all . Relative size of species is only useful when two species can be seen side by side , as the overlap in size is large and the difference in size small . 
 Juveniles resemble adults , but lack throat hackles , and sometimes have a pink fleshy gape . The bill is shorter and shallower ; its base can be pinkish and the tip can be light grey . The plumage is more ruffled and softer in appearance , lacks the glossy highlights and often having a brown tinge . The bare skin on the throat is pink in bird that have recently left the nest . Eye colour varies with age , gradually lightening from juvenile to adult . Nestlings up to four months old have blue @-@ grey irises , juveniles aged from four to fifteen months have dark brown irises , and immature birds have hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months . Immature birds older than one year develop hackles , while some pink remains in the gape until the bird is two or three years of age . 
 = = = Vocalisations = = = 
 The territorial call of the Australian raven is a slow , high ah @-@ ah @-@ <unk> with the last note drawn out . It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area . When giving this call , the species has a horizontal posture , holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground , while perched on a prominent position . It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail , and sometimes holds its beak open between calls . In contrast , the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture . This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven 's territory . The five Australian species are very difficult to tell apart , with the call being the easiest way to do so , although the drawing @-@ out of the final note — long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven — has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic . 
 The volume , pitch , tempo and order of notes can be changed depending on the message the Australian raven intends to convey . There are a variety of contact calls : a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting , and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest . Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging . Birds in flocks make a single high @-@ pitched <unk> while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through . An Australian raven will give a longer <unk> with a downward <unk> to signify its return to the nest to its mate .

 The Australian raven is common throughout eastern Australia , and southern Western Australia ( the populations being connected by a narrow strip across the Nullarbor Plain ) , but it is rarer and more scattered in the north , with isolated sightings in Cape York at Coen , Windmill Creek and the Mitchell River , and becoming more common south of Rockhampton in central Queensland . It is found throughout New South Wales , though is uncommon in the northeast of the state . It is rare in the Australian Alps , being replaced there by the little raven . It occurs across Victoria and eastern South Australia , through the Eyre Peninsula and Nullarbor Plain into Western Australia , across the state north to the Wooramel River . It is found on some offshore islands such as Rottnest Island and Kangaroo Island . It is a rare vagrant to Lord Howe Island . 
 The Australian raven can be found in a wide range of natural and modified habitats . It requires available water and trees ( or buildings ) to roost in or perch on . Preferred habitats include eucalypt @-@ dominated sclerophyll forest , and farmland adjacent to trees . It is also found in heath and mangroves . In areas where it occurs with the little raven , namely over much of central New South Wales , Victoria and into South Australia , the Australian raven is restricted to more forested areas while the latter species prefers more open areas . Similarly , in inland Australia it can share range with the little crow , as the two do not appear to compete . However , the ranges of similar @-@ sized forest raven and Torresian crow only narrowly overlap with the Australian raven as all three compete with each other . In central and western regions , Australian ravens and Torresian crows <unk> for the scattered uncommon trees and outcrops , and only one or the other are found there . It co @-@ occurs with the forest raven in northeastern New South Wales from Port Stephens northwards . The Australian raven has adapted very well to human habitation in some cities and is the most common corvid in Canberra , Sydney and Perth ; in Melbourne and Adelaide it is replaced by the little raven , and by the Torresian crow in Brisbane . Its large range , abundance and increasing population mean it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List .
