 White @-@ faced capuchin troops occupy home ranges of between 32 and 86 hectares ( 79 and 213 acres ) . They travel between 1 and 3 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 62 and 1 @.@ 86 mi ) daily , averaging 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) per day . Although they engage in activity that has been described as " territorial " , more recent research indicates that white @-@ faced capuchin troops tend to behave aggressively to other white @-@ faced capuchin troops regardless of where they meet , and the aggression is not necessarily intended to exclude the other troops from a specific home range . 
 Home ranges overlap extensively , so groups are not territorial in the strictest sense of the word . Perhaps because of the intensity of male @-@ male competition and the threat of infanticide , interactions between groups are typically hostile : the males display aggressively toward one another and sometimes engage in physical aggression ( even killing an opponent ) , while females grab their infants and run . Typically , males are the primary participants in aggressive intergroup encounters , and it seems likely that males are defending access to the females in their groups . Alpha males , who have the largest reproductive stake in the group , participate at a higher rate than subordinate males . Groups with more males have an advantage over groups with fewer males , but the location of the encounter within the home range matters as well ; smaller groups defeat larger groups when the contest occurs in the core or center area of the smaller group 's home range . 
 = = = Interspecific interactions = = = 
 The white @-@ headed capuchin sometimes interacts with other sympatric monkey species . White @-@ headed capuchins sometimes travel with and even groom Geoffroy 's spider monkeys . However , aggressive interactions between the capuchins and spider monkeys also occur . Interactions between the white @-@ headed capuchin and mantled howler are infrequent , and sometimes result in the capuchins threatening the larger howlers . However , affiliative associations between the capuchins and howlers do sometimes occur , mostly involving juveniles playing together . 
 Although South American capuchin species often travel with and feed together with squirrel monkeys , the white @-@ headed capuchin only rarely associates with the Central American squirrel monkey . This appears to be related to the patchier , more dispersed distribution of food resources in Central America and the fact that there is less dietary overlap between the Central American squirrel monkey and the white @-@ headed capuchin than between their South American counterparts . Therefore , there is less benefit to the Central American squirrel monkey in associating with the white @-@ headed capuchin in order to exploit the capuchin 's knowledge of food resource distribution . In addition , compared to their South American counterparts , male white @-@ headed capuchins are relatively more alert to rival males than to predators , reducing the predator detection benefits that the Central American squirrel monkey receives from associating with the white @-@ headed capuchin compared to its South American counterparts . Since the squirrel monkeys generally initiate interactions with the capuchins in South America , the fact that similar associations would impose higher foraging costs and impart fewer predator detection benefits to the Central American squirrel monkey leads to fewer associations with the white @-@ headed capuchin . 
 Several non @-@ primate animal species tend to follow troops of white @-@ faced monkeys or are otherwise attracted by their <unk> white @-@ lipped peccaries and common agoutis are attracted by feeding white @-@ headed capuchins , looking for fruit that the capuchins drop . Several species of bird are also known to follow white @-@ headed capuchins looking for food . These include the double @-@ toothed kite , the white hawk and the sharp @-@ shinned hawk . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The white @-@ headed capuchin is an omnivore . Its primary foods are fruit and insects . It forages at all levels of the forest , including the ground . Methods for finding food include stripping bark off of trees , searching through leaf litter , breaking dead tree branches , rolling over rocks , and using stones as anvils to crack hard fruits . Its prehensile tail assists with feeding , helping support the monkey when foraging for food below the branches . 
 Fruit can make up between 50 % and 67 % or more of the capuchin 's diet . In one study in Panama , white @-@ headed capuchins ate 95 different fruit species . Among its favorite fruits are figs from the family Moraceae , mangos and related fruits from the family <unk> , the bean @-@ like fruits from the family Leguminosae and fruits from the family Rubiaceae . It generally only eats ripe fruit , testing for ripeness by smelling , tasting and prodding the fruit . It typically eats only the pulp and juice , spitting out the seeds and fibers . Other plant matter eaten includes flowers , young leaves , seeds of certain plants , and bromeliads . It also uses the <unk> as a water source , drinking the water that gets trapped inside . In <unk> National Park the capuchins have a varied diet in addition to the above of banana fruits and flowers , <unk> seeds , <unk> de caballo fruits and <unk> stems . 
 Insect prey eaten includes beetle larvae , butterfly and moth caterpillars , ants , wasps , and ant and wasp larvae . It also eats larger prey , such as birds , bird eggs , frogs , lizards , crabs , mollusks and small mammals . The population in Guanacaste , Costa Rica in particular is noted for hunting squirrels , magpies , white @-@ crowned parrots and baby coatis . The amount of vertebrate prey eaten varies by troop . Even neighboring troops can show significant differences in their diets . 
 The diet can vary between the rainy and dry season . For example , in Guanacaste , Costa Rica the white @-@ headed capuchin can eat a wide variety of fruits as well as caterpillars in the early rainy season ( June to November ) . But during the dry season , only figs and a few other types of fruit are available . During the dry season , chitinous insects , ant and wasp larvae and vertebrates become a particularly important part of the white @-@ headed capuchin 's diet . Access to water can also become an issue during the dry season . The white @-@ headed capuchin likes to drink daily , so in forests where water holes dry up during the dry season , there can be competition between troops over access to the remaining water holes . 
 = = = Tool use = = = 
 <unk> are considered among the most intelligent of the New World monkeys ; they have been the subject of many studies on behaviour and intelligence . The capuchins ' intelligence is thought to be an adaptation to support their feeding habits ; they rely on ephemeral food sources which may be hard to find . In one particular study conducted in 2007 , capuchins were found to be among the ten most intelligent primates , second to spider monkeys among New World monkeys . 
 The white @-@ headed capuchin is known to rub parts of certain plants into their hair . Plants used in this manner include citrus fruits , vines of the genera Piper and Clematis , monkey comb ( genus <unk> ) , dumb cane and custard apple . Ants and millipedes are also used in this way . It is not definitively known what this rubbing is for , but this may deter parasites such as ticks and insects , or it may serve as a fungicide or <unk> or anti @-@ inflammatory agent . Alternatively , it may be a form of scent marking . 
 The white @-@ headed capuchin also uses tools in other ways . It has been known to beat snakes with sticks in order to protect itself or to get the snake to release an infant . In captivity , it has been known to use tools to get to food or to defend itself , and in one case a white @-@ headed capuchin used a squirrel monkey as a projectile , hurling it at a human observer . It has been historically noted that the species is often able to recognize , and therefore avoid baited cage traps , and hidden net snares are often the only way to capture this monkey . Some populations also use trees or other hard surfaces as anvils in order to crack mollusks . And it sometimes uses sticks as probes to explore openings . 
 Though the white @-@ headed capuchin has perhaps the most extensive and most frequent tool use in comparison to the other gracile capuchins , its tool use is considerably inferior to that of robust capuchins , especially the tufted capuchin . Factors such as easier access to water and food may have to do with the white @-@ headed capuchin 's less extensive use of tools . 
 The white @-@ headed capuchin 's intelligence and ability to use tools allows them to be trained to assist paraplegics . Other species of capuchin monkeys are also trained in this manner . White @-@ headed capuchins can also be trained for roles on television and movies , such as Marcel on the television series Friends . They were also traditionally used as organ grinder monkeys . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 The white @-@ headed capuchin is noisy . Loud calls , such as barks and coughs , are used to communicate threat warnings , and softer calls , such as squeals , are used in intimate discourse . Different types of threats , such as a threat from a terrestrial animal versus a threat from a bird , invoke different vocalizations . Facial expressions and scent are also important to communication . It sometimes engages in a practice known as " urine washing " , in which the monkey rubs urine on its feet . The exact purpose of this practice is unknown , but it may be a form of olfactory signal . 
 = = Reproduction = = 
 The white @-@ headed capuchin uses a polygamous mating system in which a male may mate with multiple females . Although the dominant male does not monopolize breeding , studies have shown that the dominant male does tend to father most of the young . Although a female may mate with several males , the dominant male may be more likely to copulate when the female is at peak fertility . Nonetheless , there is evidence that dominant males do tend to avoid breeding with their own daughters who are members of the troop . Such avoidance is rare among New World primates . 
 Copulation takes about 2 minutes , and the gestation period is 5 to 6 months . Usually a single young is born , but twins occur occasionally . Most births occur during the dry season from December to April . The infant is carried across its mother 's back for about 6 weeks . After about 4 to 5 weeks it can stray from its mother for brief periods and by about 3 months it can move around independently , although some infants will be mostly independent earlier . Weaning occurs between 6 and 12 months . While the mother rests , the young spends most of its time foraging or playing , either on its own or with other juveniles . <unk> engage in high levels of alloparenting , in which monkeys other than the mother help care for the infant . Infants are carried by <unk> most often between 4 and 6 weeks in age . Males as well as females engage in alloparenting . 
 Like other capuchin species , the white @-@ headed capuchin matures slowly . Sexual maturity can be reached at 3 years . But on average , females give birth for the first time at 7 years old and give birth every 26 months thereafter . Males attain reproductive maturity at 10 years old . The white @-@ headed capuchin has a long life span given its size . The maximum recorded life span in captivity is over 54 years . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The white @-@ headed capuchin is found in much of Central America and a small portion of South America . In Central America , its range includes much of Honduras , Nicaragua , Costa Rica and Panama . It has also been reported to occur in eastern Guatemala and southern Belize , but these reports are unconfirmed . In South America the white @-@ headed capuchin is found in the extreme north @-@ western strip between the Pacific Ocean and the Andes Mountains in Colombia and northwestern Ecuador . It is among the most commonly seen monkeys in Central America 's national parks , such as Manuel Antonio National Park , Corcovado National Park , Santa Rosa National Park and <unk> National Park . 
 It should also be noted that while it is very common in Costa Rica and Panama , the monkey has been largely extirpated from Honduras and much of Nicaragua . Many Honduran capuchins were captured and relocated to the island of Roatán , and many Nicaraguan capuchins were captured and relocated to the island of <unk> . In Nicaragua , wild capuchins may still be easily spotted in regions around Masaya , as well as around Bluefields and other locations around the South Caribbean coast . The monkey can also be observed near the Costa Rican border along the San Juan River , and in <unk> Creek Rainforest Preserve . 
 It is found in many different types of forest , including mature and secondary forests , and including evergreen and deciduous forests , dry and moist forests , and mangrove and montane forests . However , it appears to prefer primary or advanced secondary forests . Also , higher densities of white @-@ headed capuchins are found in older areas of forest and in areas containing evergreen forest , as well as areas with more water availability during the dry season . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 The white @-@ headed capuchin is regarded as " least concern " from a conservation standpoint by IUCN . However , its numbers are affected by the fact that it is sometimes captured for the pet trade . Its status can also be harmed by deforestation . However , deforestation may also impact its main predator , the harpy eagle , more than it directly impacts the white @-@ headed capuchin , and so on a net basis deforestation may not be as harmful to the capuchin 's status . The white @-@ headed capuchin can adapt to forest fragmentation better than other species due to its ability to live in a wide variety of forest types and exploit a wide variety of food sources . The white @-@ headed capuchin is important to its ecosystems as a seed and pollen disperser . It also impacts the ecosystem by eating insects that act as pests to certain trees , by pruning certain trees , such as Gustavia superba and Bursera simaruba , causing them generate more branches and possibly additional fruit , and by accelerating germination of certain seeds when they pass through the capuchin 's digestive tract . In addition , the white @-@ headed capuchin sometimes kills Acacia <unk> plants when it rips through the plant 's branches to get to resident ant colonies . 
 = All I Want for Christmas Is You = 
 " All I Want for Christmas Is You " is a song performed by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey , and written and produced by Carey . It was released by Columbia Records on November 1 , 1994 as the lead single from her first holiday album and fourth studio album , Merry Christmas . " Christmas " is an uptempo love song that includes bell chimes and heavy back @-@ up vocals , as well as use of synthesizers . The song 's lyrics declare that the narrator does not care about Christmas presents or lights ; all she wants for Christmas is to be with her lover . 
 Two music videos were commissioned for the song : the song 's primary music video features grainy home @-@ movie @-@ style footage of Carey , her dogs and family during the holiday season , as well as Carey dressed in a Santa suit frolicking on a snowy mountainside . Carey 's then @-@ husband Tommy Mottola makes a cameo appearance as Santa Claus , bringing Carey a gift and leaving on a red sleigh . The second video was filmed in black and white format , and features Carey dressed in 1960s style in homage to The Ronettes , alongside back up singers and female dancers . Carey has performed " All I Want for Christmas Is You " in a slew of live television appearances and tours throughout her career . In 2010 , Carey re @-@ recorded the song for her second holiday album , Merry Christmas II You , titled " All I Want for Christmas Is You ( Extra Festive ) " . Carey also re @-@ recorded the song as a duet with Canadian singer Justin Bieber for his 2011 album Under the Mistletoe , titled " All I Want for Christmas for You ( <unk> ! ) " . The song has also been covered by many artists over the years . 
 In the years since its original release , " All I Want for Christmas Is You " has been critically lauded and has become established as a Christmas standard ; it was once called " one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon " in The New Yorker , and continues to surge in popularity each holiday season . The song was commercially successful , reaching the number @-@ two position on the singles charts of Australia , Japan , the Netherlands , Norway , and the United Kingdom , and the top 10 in several other countries . The Daily Telegraph hailed " All I Want for Christmas Is You " as the most popular and most played Christmas song of the decade in the United Kingdom . Rolling Stone ranked it fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list , calling it a " holiday standard . " In December 2015 , the song peaked at 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 , making it its highest peak since its original release . 
 With global sales of over 14 million copies , the song remains Carey 's biggest international success and the 11th best @-@ selling single of all time . As of 2013 , the song was reported to have earned $ 50 million in royalties . 
 = = Background and writing = = 
 Following the success of the singer 's 1993 career best @-@ selling album Music Box , Carey and her management at Columbia Records began devising ideas and strategies for subsequent projects . Carey 's then @-@ husband , Tommy Mottola , head of Columbia 's parent label Sony Music Entertainment , began mapping out possible follow ups for the singer during the pinnacle years of her career . During initial discussions regarding the thought of doing a Christmas @-@ themed album with Carey and her writing partner of over four years , Walter Afanasieff , fear arose that it wasn 't commercially expedient or wise to release holiday music at the peak of one 's career , as it was more often equated with a release towards the end of a musician 's waning career . Afanasieff recalled his sentiments during initial discussions for a holiday record : " Back then , you didn 't have a lot of artists with Christmas albums . It wasn 't a known science at all back then , and there was nobody who did new , big Christmas songs . So we were going to release it as kind of an everyday , ' Hey , you know , we 're putting out a Christmas album . No big deal . ' " Ultimately , with Mottola 's persistence and Carey 's initiative to be a " risk @-@ taker " as Afanasieff put it , the song and its parent album , Merry Christmas , began taking form in early @-@ mid 1994 . Recording for the album began in June , while the Carey @-@ Afanasieff songwriting duo penned " All I Want for Christmas Is You " in late @-@ August . Often referencing herself a festive person and demonstrating a usual penchant for her love of all things Christmas , Carey began decorating the home she shared with Mottola in upstate New York ( which also came equipped with a personal recording studio ) with Christmas ornaments and other holiday @-@ inspired trinkets . In doing so , Carey felt she could capture the essence and spirit of what she was singing and make her vocal performance and delivery more emotive and authentic . The songwriting pair carved out the chords , structure and melody for the song in just a quarter of an hour : " It 's definitely not ' Swan Lake , ' ' admits Afanasieff . ' But that 's why it 's so popular — because it 's so simple and palatable ! " . At first , Afanasieff admitted that he was puzzled and " blanched " as to where Carey 's wanted to take the melody and vocal scales , though she was " adamant " in her direction for the song . In an interview with Billboard , Afanasieff described the type of relationship he and Carey shared in the studio and as songwriters for the song and in general : 
 It was always the same sort of system with us . We would write the nucleus of the song , the melody primary music , and then some of the words were there as we finished writing it . I started playing some rock ' n ' roll piano and started boogie woogie @-@ ing my left hand , and that inspired Mariah to come up with the melodic [ Sings . ] ' I don 't want a lot for Christmas . ' And then we started singing and playing around with this rock ' n ' roll boogie song , which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being ' All I Want For Christmas Is You . ' That one went very quickly : It was an easier song to write then some of the other ones . It was very formulaic ; not a lot of chord changes . I tried to make it a little more unique , putting in some special chords that you really don 't hear a lot of , which made it unique and special . 
 Then for the next week or two Mariah would call me and say , ' What do you think about this bit ? ' We would talk a little bit until she got the lyrics all nicely coordinated and done . And then we just waited until the sessions began , which were in the summer of ' 94 where we got together in New York and started recording . And that 's when we first hear her at the microphone singing , and the rest is history . 
 Afanasieff flew back to California where he finished the song 's programming and production . Originally , he had a live band play the drums and other instruments with the thought of giving it a more raw and affective sound . He was unhappy with the results of the recording and subsequently scrapped the effort and used his original , personal arrangement and programmed all the instruments heard on the song ( with the exception of the background vocals ) including the piano , effects , drums and triangle . While Carey continued writing material in her rented home in The Hamptons , Afanasieff completed the song 's programming and awaited to rendezvous with her a final time in order to layer and harmonize the background vocals . In touching on several aspects of what excited her to record and release a Christmas album , Carey went into detail on what writing and recording the song and album meant for her : " I 'm a very festive person and I love the holidays . I 've sung Christmas songs since I was a little girl . I used to go Christmas caroling . When it came to the album , we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs . It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs , but for the most part people really want to hear the standards at Christmas time , no matter how good a new song is . " 
 = = Composition and lyrics = = 
 " All I Want for Christmas Is You " is an uptempo song , composed with pop , soul , R & B , gospel , dance @-@ pop and rhythmic adult contemporary influences and stylings . By early August , Carey already had two original songs written alongside Afanasieff ; the " sad and <unk> @-@ y " " Miss You Most ( At Christmas Time ) " and the " Gospel @-@ tinged and religious " " Jesus Born on This Day " . The third and final original song the pair planned to write was to be centered and inspired and in the vein of a " Phil Spector , old rock ' n roll , sixties @-@ sounding Christmas song " . Critics have noted the song 's 1940 's , 1950 's , and 1960 's influences , and in conjunction with Carey 's voice and its simplistic melody , heralded it as its recipe for success . In discussing the song 's chord progression and stylistic approaches , Slate 's Adam Ragusea hailed the song as " the only Christmas song written in the last half @-@ century worthy of inclusion in the Great American Songbook . " The A.V. Club 's Annie Zaleski attributes the song 's enduring appeal to its ambiguity in being able to pin it down as belonging to a specific era . The song begins with a " sparking " bit of percussion " that resembles an antique music box or a whimsical snow globe . " After Carey 's a capella style vocal introduction , the song introduces other seasonal percussive signifiers including ; celebratory church @-@ like bells , cheerful sleigh bells , and " an underlying rhythmic beat that sounds like the loping pace of a horse or reindeer . These sounds echo religious and secular musical touchstones , without veering blatantly too much in either direction , and give the song an upbeat , joyous tone . " In an interview in 1994 , Carey described the song as " fun " , and continued : " It 's very traditional , old @-@ fashioned Christmas . It 's very retro , kind of ' 60s . " Afanasieff went further in breaking down the song 's musical elements : " A lush bed of keyboards , reminiscent of a small @-@ scale Wall of Sound , cushions the song 's cheery rhythms , while a soulful vocal chorus adds robust oohs , tension @-@ creating counter @-@ melodies , and festive harmonies . Most notably , however , the song 's jaunty piano chords and melody keep the song merrily bouncing along . " Critics noted the song a tad reminiscent of the works of Judy Garland and Nat King Cole , while also describing it as hearkening back to " ' 60s and ' 70s Motown covers of prewar Christmas classics , such as The Jackson 5 's [ and ] Stevie Wonder " . Slate 's Ragusea conceded that " All I Want For Christmas Is You " " sounds like it could have been written in the ' 40s and locked in a Brill Building safe . " 
 Lyrically , the song focuses on the yearning desire to be with a loved one for Christmas , regardless of whether they have to forgo the usual commercial aspect of the holiday season such as ornamental lights , trees , snow and presents . The song incorporates various instruments , including piano , drums , violin , oboe , flute , bell chimes , bass effect , and cowbells . The song layers background vocals throughout the chorus and sections of the bridge . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony / ATV Music Publishing , " All I Want for Christmas Is You " is set in common time and in the key of G major . Carey 's vocal range in the song spans from the note of G3 to the high note of G5 . Carey wrote the song 's lyrics and melody , while Walter Afanasieff arranged and produced the piece with synthetically created computerized equipment . Slate 's Ragusea counts " at least 13 distinct chords at work , resulting in a sumptuously chromatic melody . The song also includes what I consider the most Christmassy chord of all — a minor subdominant , or ' iv , ' chord with an added 6 , under the words ' underneath the Christmas tree , ' among other places . ( You might also analyze it as a half @-@ diminished ' ii ' 7th chord , but either interpretation seems accurate ) . " According to Roch Parisien from AllMusic , the song contains " The Beach Boys @-@ style harmonies , jangling bells , and a sleigh @-@ ride pace , injecting one of the few bits of exuberant fun in this otherwise vanilla set . " In a piece on the song in Vogue , a writer felt the song 's lyrics helped solidify its status over two decades later : " those lyrics could have been sung by Frank Sinatra — well , maybe not Frank , but another singer back then . I think that ’ s what gives it that timeless , classic quality . " 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " All I Want for Christmas Is You " was critically acclaimed by music critics . Parisien called the song " a year @-@ long banger " , complimenting its instrumentation and melody . Steve Morse , editor of The Boston Globe , wrote that Carey sang with a lot of soul . According to Barry Schwartz from Stylus Magazine , " to say this song is an instant classic somehow doesn 't capture its <unk> ; it 's a modern standard : joyous , exhilarating , loud , with even a hint of longing . " Schwartz praised the song 's lyrics as well , describing them as " beautifully phrased , " and calling Carey 's voice " gorgeous " and " sincere . " Kyle Anderson from MTV labeled the track " a majestic anthem full of chimes , sleigh bells , doo @-@ wop flourishes , sweeping strings and one of the most dynamic and clean vocal performances of Carey 's career " . While reviewing the 2009 remix version , Becky Bain from Idolator called the song a " timeless classic " and wrote , " We love the original song to pieces — we blast it while decorating our Christmas tree and lighting our Menorah . " In his review for Carey 's Merry Christmas II You , Thomas Connor from the Chicago Sun @-@ Times called the song " a simple , well @-@ crafted chestnut and one of the last great additions to the Christmas pop canon " . Shona Craven of Scotland 's The Herald , said , " [ it 's ] a song of optimism and joy that maybe , just maybe , hints at the real meaning of Christmas . " Additionally , she felt the main reason it was so successful is the subject " you " in the lyrics , explaining , " Perhaps what makes the song such a huge hit is the fact that it 's for absolutely everyone . " Craven opened her review with a bold statement : " Bing Crosby may well be turning in his grave , but no child of the 1980s will be surprised to see Mariah Carey 's sublime All I Want For Christmas Is You bounding up the charts after being named the nation 's top festive song . " In a 2006 retrospective look at Carey 's career , Sasha Frere @-@ Jones of The New Yorker said , the " charming " song was one of Carey 's biggest accomplishments , calling it " one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon " . Dan Hancox , editor of The National , quoted and agreed with Jones ' statement , calling the song " perfection " . In 2010 , Rolling Stone ranked " All I Want for Christmas Is You " fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list , calling it a " holiday standard . "

 In the United States , in the first week of January 1995 , " All I Want for Christmas Is You " peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary and at No. 12 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart . The song placed on these two charts again in December 1995 and in December 1996 . The song was ineligible for inclusion on the Billboard Hot 100 during its original release , because it was not released commercially as a single . This rule lapsed in 1998 , however , allowing the song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 ( peaking at No. 83 in January 2000 ) . The song topped the Billboard Hot Digital Songs chart in December 2005 , but it was unable to attain a new peak on the Billboard Hot 100 chart because it was considered a recurrent single and was thus ineligible for chart re @-@ entry .

 When the song was first released as a single in 1994 , no remixes were commissioned except for the instrumental version , however this version was not released on the single that year . Carey re @-@ released the song commercially in Japan in 2000 , with a new remix known as the So So Def remix . The remix contains new vocals and is played over a harder , more urban beat ; it features raps by Jermaine Dupri and Bow Wow . The remix appears on Carey 's compilation album Greatest Hits ( 2001 ) as a bonus track . In 2009 , a remix produced by Carey and Low Sunday , called " Mariah 's New Dance Mix " , was released . The mix laid the original 1994 vocals over new electronic instrumentation . The remix garnered a positive response . MTV 's Kyle Anderson wrote that " it 's difficult to improve perfection , " but that the remix " does dress up the song in a disco thump that should make your office Christmas party 28 percent funkier than it was last year . " Idolator 's Becky Bain praised the song 's catchiness . 
 In 2010 , Carey re @-@ recorded the song for her thirteenth studio and second holiday album , Merry Christmas II You .

Thomas Connor from the Chicago Sun @-@ Times wrote that the new version " just seems to add a few brassy backup singers to the exact same arrangement . " Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone agreed , writing that it was " hard to figure out what 's ' extra festive ' " about the new version . Dan Hancox , editor of The National , also felt the new version was unnecessary . In 2011 , Justin Bieber also recorded a version of the song as a duet with Carey on his holiday album , Under the Mistletoe .

 Carey has performed the song during concerts as well as live televised performances . It was part of the set @-@ list during the Japanese shows of Carey 's Daydream World Tour ( 1996 ) , Butterfly World Tour ( 1998 ) , Charmbracelet World Tour ( 2002 – 03 ) , and The Adventures of Mimi Tour ( 2006 ) . Additionally , Carey performed the song at the 2004 Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade , which aired on ABC . Carey sang the So So Def remix version at the opening night of her Angels Advocate Tour on New Year 's Eve . On November 9 , 2010 , Carey taped a live Christmas Special featuring the song , which aired on December 13 , 2010 on ABC . Additionally , Carey performed the song alongside " Oh Santa ! " airing on ESPN and ABC throughout the day on Christmas Day of 2010 . On December 3 , she performed both songs at the Walt Disney World Resort theme park , Magic Kingdom , in a performance that was taped and aired part of the Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade on ABC . She performed them again in a music video promoting the day 's NBA games that aired on both networks . Carey also included the track as the encore to her sold out , first annual Christmas concert series at the Beacon Theater in New York City . The show was entitled All I Want For Christmas Is You , A Night of Joy & Festivity . 
 = = Music videos = = 
 There are three music videos for " All I Want for Christmas Is You " . The first , primary video was shot in the style of a home video ; it was directed and filmed by Carey during the Christmas season of 1993 . The video begins with Carey placing holiday ornaments on a Christmas tree and frolicking through the snowy mountainside . Outdoor scenes were shot at the Fairy Tale Forest in New Jersey , where Carey 's then @-@ husband Tommy Mottola made a cameo appearance as Santa Claus . It continues with scenes of Carey getting ready for her album cover photo shoot and spending time with her dog Jack . It concludes with Santa Claus leaving Carey with a bag of presents and waving goodbye . In the song 's alternate video , inspired by The Ronettes , Carey dances in a 1960s @-@ influenced studio surrounded by go – go dancers . For a 1960s look , the video was filmed in black and white , with Carey in white boots and teased up hair . This video was also directed by Carey . There are two edits to this version of the video . 
 Another video was created for the So So Def remix , but it does not feature Carey or the hip @-@ hop musicians that perform in the song . Instead , the video is animated and based on a scene in the video from Carey 's " Heartbreaker " ( 1999 ) . It features cartoon cameo appearances by Carey , Jermaine Dupri , Bow Wow , Luis Miguel ( Carey 's boyfriend at the time ) , Carey 's dog Jack , and Santa Claus . Kris <unk> is credited with directing the music video . Since 2009 , the song has been included in a music video accompanying ESPN 's ( and their sister station , ABC ) Christmas Day coverage of the NBA . The music video for the duet featuring Bieber was filmed in Macy 's department store in New York , and features Bieber shopping with his friends whilst Carey is seen singing in the background .

 = 28 cm SK L / 40 " Bruno " = 
 The 28 cm SK L / 40 " Bruno " ( SK — <unk> ( quick @-@ loading cannon ) L — <unk> ( with a 40 caliber barrel ) was a German railroad gun . Originally a naval gun , it was adapted for land service after its ships were disarmed beginning in 1916 . It served on the Western Front and on coast defense duties in Occupied Flanders during World War I. Belgium received four guns as reparations after the war . The Germans used two of those guns in World War II after Belgium 's surrender during the Battle of France and on coast @-@ defense duties on the Gironde Estuary for the rest of the war . 
 = = Design and history = = 
 These 28 cm SK L / 40 guns were used as the main armament of the Braunschweig and Deutschland @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships , but they were transferred to the Army from the Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) when those ships began to be relegated to training duties in 1916 after the Battle of Jutland had proved that they were not suitable for contemporary naval combat . One change made for land service was the placement of a large counterweight just forward of the trunnions to counteract the preponderance of weight towards the breech . This , although heavy , was simpler than adding <unk> to perform the same function . In 1917 , the first four guns , formerly used on SMS Lothringen , were placed in firing platform ( Bettungsschiessgerüst ) mountings for coast defense duty as part of Batterie Graf Spee on the island of Wangerooge . 
 The firing platform was a semi @-@ portable mount that could be emplaced anywhere after several weeks of labor to prepare the position . It rotated on a pivot at the front of the mount . The rear was supported by rollers resting on a semicircular rail and was generally equipped with a gun shield . 
 Twenty guns , from the battleships Braunschweig , Hessen , Preussen , Deutschland , Schlesien , and Schleswig @-@ Holstein were mounted on the railroad and firing platform ( Eisenbahn und Bettungsschiessgerüst ) ( E. u . B. ) mounts successfully used by other German railroad guns . 
 The E. u . B. could fire from any suitable section of track after curved wedges were bolted to the track behind each wheel to absorb any residual recoil after the gun cradle recoiled backwards . It also had a pintle built into the underside of the front of the mount . Two large rollers were fitted to the underside of the mount at the rear . Seven cars could carry a portable metal firing platform ( <unk> ) that had a central pivot mount and an outer rail . It was assembled with the aid of a derrick or crane , which took between three and five days , and railroad tracks were laid slightly past the firing platform to accommodate the front bogies of the gun . The gun was moved over the firing platform and then lowered into position after the central section of rail was removed . After the gun 's pintle was bolted to the firing platform 's pivot mount , the entire carriage was jacked up so that the trucks and their sections of rail could be removed . The carriage was then lowered so that the rear rollers rested on the outer track . Concrete versions were also used . It could have up to 360 ° of traverse . 
 = = = Ammunition = = = 
 Ammunition was moved by means of an overhead rail from which a shell trolley carried individual shells to be placed in the loading tray fixed to the breech . An extensible rail could raised and braced in place to allow the shell trolley to reach shells placed on the ground or in an ammunition car behind the mount . This ammunition car sometimes had its own overhead rail to move the shells forward to where the trolley in the mount could reach it through a hatch in the roof . The shell and powder were manually rammed into the gun . The gun had to be loaded at zero elevation and thus needed to be re @-@ aimed between each shot . It used the German naval system of ammunition where the base charge was held in a metallic cartridge case and supplemented by another charge in a silk bag which was rammed first . 
 = = Combat history = = 
 The Navy kept most of the " Brunos " and used them on coast @-@ defense duties , mainly in Occupied Flanders to protect the ports of Ostend and Zeebrugge . Sailor Artillery Regiment ( German : <unk> Artillerie Regiment ) 1 defended the latter with Batteries Hessen ( 3 or 4 guns ) and Braunschweig ( 4 x " Brunos " ) . Those same sources disagree about the number of guns assigned to Batteries Hannover ( 3 or 4 " Brunos " ) and Preussen ( 4 guns ) defending Ostende under the command of Sailor Artillery Regiment 2 . Battery <unk> , with 2 guns , saw service against the British during the Spring Offensive in March – April 1918 . Only two " Brunos " were given to the Army - they served in Battery 746 and Bavarian Battery ( German : Bayerische Batterie ) 1005 . The latter gun , on E. u . B. mount No. 7 , formerly carried by Hessen , was captured by the Australian Army on 8 August 1918 . Its barrel is preserved today in Canberra , Australia , as the Amiens Gun . 
 After the Armistice was signed on 11 November 1918 , a battery of four " Brunos " stationed in Belgium sought asylum in the Netherlands . They were given to Belgium as reparations . Six were destroyed in 1921 – 22 by the Military Inter @-@ Allied Commission of Control . 
 After the surrender of Belgium on 28 May 1940 , two " Brunos " were used by Battery 655 between 8 and 10 June to fire on <unk> and Reims from <unk> . One gun was destroyed when a shell detonated prematurely in the barrel while firing on those targets . By the end of 1941 , two " Brunos " were assigned to Battery 721 and stationed at Le Verdon @-@ sur @-@ Mer defending the mouth of the Gironde Estuary under the command of Artillery Group Gironde @-@ South ( German : <unk> Gironde @-@ Süd ) . The battery was able to retreat to Germany by 1 September 1944 after the invasion of Normandy began in June 1944 , but nothing is known of its activities afterwards . 
 = Million Dollar Challenge ( poker ) = 
 Million Dollar Challenge ( also referred to as the PokerStars Million Dollar Challenge and <unk> Million Dollar Challenge ) is the most watched poker show in television history . It is sponsored by PokerStars . The show , which airs on the Fox Broadcasting Company , debuted on October 11 , 2009 . The show is hosted by Chris Rose and features Daniel Negreanu . The first season included five episodes following the FOX network Sunday National Football League coverage . The finale aired on December 27 , 2009 . The eight @-@ episode season 2 premiered on September 19 , 2010 and is scheduled to conclude on December 12 . 
 = = Show description = = 
 Million Dollar Challenge is a poker game show where amateur poker players attempt to defeat celebrities , professional poker players and , eventually , Daniel Negreanu in order to win the show 's grand prize , $ 1 million . In the first round , the amateur ( with Negreanu at their side , acting as their coach and lending advice ) must defeat a celebrity such as Jayde Nicole , Jerome Bettis , Joanna Krupa , John Salley or Tito Ortiz . If the contestant is able to defeat the celebrity the contestant wins a trip to the Bahamas and advances to the second round . In the second round , the amateur ( with Negreanu now helping them from a sound proof booth , giving them advice through a listening device in the amateur 's ear ) must defeat a professional poker player such as Vanessa Rousso , Barry Greenstein , Joe Cada or Chris Moneymaker . If the contestant is able to defeat the professional the contestant wins $ 25 @,@ 000 in addition to the trip to the Bahamas . At this point , the amateur has a decision to make . Keep the money and walk away $ 25 @,@ 000 richer , or risk the money ( the trip is still theirs to keep ) and play Daniel Negreanu heads @-@ up for $ 100 @,@ 000 , knowing that if they lose they walk away with nothing but the trip to the Bahamas . In the season finale , the champions from each episode compete against each other in a sit @-@ n @-@ go tournament , the winner of which plays Negreanu for $ 1 million .

 The first three episodes of the season were the three most @-@ watched Poker television shows in U.S. history . The show aired on Sundays after the FOX National Football League coverage . In the first episode that aired on October 11 , contestant Father Andrew Trapp defeated John Salley , Rousso and Negreanu , winning $ 100 @,@ 000 and a trip to the Bahamas in the process , all of which he promised to donate to his church in Garden City , South Carolina . Trapp also won the chance to play in a mini @-@ tournament ( Episode 5 ) , the winner of which would play Negreanu for $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . On October 18 , after contestant Tracy Nguyen defeated Bettis and won a trip to the Bahamas , but lost to Barry Greenstein , the next contestant Sergeant Denny Luna defeated Nicole , Moneymaker to win $ 25 @,@ 000 and a trip to the Bahamas . Luna then chose to walk away ( and not risk the $ 25 @,@ 000 he had already won ) rather than face Negreanu in the $ 100 @,@ 000 match . On the November 22 episode after contestant <unk> <unk> lost to Bettis , Brian Barboza defeated Nicole , Rousso and Negreanu , winning $ 100 @,@ 000 and a trip to the Bahamas . Barboza also won the chance to play in a mini @-@ tournament , the winner of which would play Negreanu for $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . In December Joanna Krupa and Joe Cada were announced as newly added as celebrity and professional opponents . Ortiz and Krupa appeared on the fourth episode , which aired on December 13 . Cada appeared , but he did not play a hand . Dwayne Buth , playing on behalf of the Cal State Fullerton wrestling team , lost to Ortiz . Mike <unk> , a first responder during the September 11 attacks lost to Krupa . The final airing of the competition among the previous winners was expected on December 27 . However , when the contestants on the fourth episode all lost , a single table tournament was held to determine the fourth contestant . <unk> won and then bested Luna , Barboza and Trapp , in that order , in the Challenge of Champions for a $ 100 @,@ 000 prize and a chance to play Negreanu for $ 1million .

There was some controversy about a poker playing priest on national television that sparked theological debate . 
 = Stoke sub Hamdon Priory = 
 Stoke sub Hamdon Priory is a complex of buildings and ruins which initially formed a 14th @-@ century college for the chantry chapel of St Nicholas , and later was the site of a farm in Stoke @-@ sub @-@ Hamdon , Somerset , England . The only building remaining from the college is a great hall and attached dwelling , dating from the late 15th century . The hall is designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building , while the outbuildings and gateway are Grade II listed . The whole site has been scheduled as an ancient monument . A number of the farm buildings are in poor condition , and have been added to the Heritage at Risk register . 
 The college was formed in 1304 as a chantry college , funded by John de Beauchamp , 1st Baron Beauchamp to serve the free chapel in his nearby manor house . Over the following 150 years , the college fell into disrepair and was rebuilt around 1460 . During the dissolution , the land passed into the laity , and was a tenanted farm until the middle of the 20th century . The National Trust bought the property in 1946 , and with the exception of the part of the house which is inhabited , the site is now open to the public . Despite being known as " The Priory " , or " Stoke sub Hamdon Priory " , the building has never been used as a priory , and there is no record of a monastic house in Stoke sub Hamdon . 
 = = History = = 
 Originally , a rectory was located on the site , which provided a home for the rector who officiated in the private chapel of St. Nicholas in the Beauchamp manor house nearby . When the rector , Henry de Wyk , resigned in 1304 , the lord of the manor , John de Beauchamp , 1st Baron Beauchamp , established a chantry and founded a college for five chaplains . It is suggested in the English Heritage listing that the rectory was probably already owned by the Beauchamps , but if not they purchased it upon de Wyk 's departure . The college was composed of four priests governed by a provost , and was attached to the manor house chapel . A National Trust report referenced in the Historic Environment Record could not determine if the pre @-@ 1304 rectory was retained for the college 's use , or if a new building was erected instead . 
 In 1444 , a report by the Bishop of Bath and Wells , Thomas Beckington , recorded that , due to poor management by the provost , the college had fallen into disrepair : the buildings were in a bad state , and only two priests remained alongside the provost , rather than the intended four . Beckington gave the governance of the college to the precentor of Wells , and a few years later the current building was erected . In his article , Chantry Priests ' Houses and other Medieval Lodgings , W. A. Pantin suggests that this building is probably smaller than the original college , due to the reduced number of clergy , and that it was most likely erected around 1450 – 60 . The English Heritage listing refers to the surviving building as being " apparently the Provost 's Lodging . " From 1473 to 1508 Provost <unk> was in charge ; however for 36 years during that time he was non @-@ resident . 
 During the reign of Henry VIII the chantry was under the control of the crown with <unk> <unk> and Carmer both being the kings chaplains and it unlikely that any investment was made in Stoke sub Hamdon Priory . By the time of the dissolution in 1548 , the chantry was already greatly reduced . The chantry holder , Thomas <unk> , was also the parish priest , but performed his duties by deputy : he supplied one to carry out his parochial role , and another to perform his chantry duties . The college building had become a free chapel , and served as a chapel of ease for the village 's residents , offering a convenient alternative to the parish church of St Mary the Virgin which was a mile away in East Stoke . The Abolition of Chantries Act resulted in the college buildings being sold to the laity in 1548 . The ownership of the estate exchanged hands frequently over the following 70 years , and during most of the period it was leased out to various tenants . The college was converted into a private house , and underwent significant renovation . Pantin suggests that the building work can be approximately dated to the period in which the Strode family inhabited the house , based upon an inscription in some panelling , " 1585 / TS " , in which the TS stands for Thomas Strode . The building was also expanded on its south side , along the street . Over the subsequent three centuries , the estate was primarily passed on through marriage and inheritance within families , though it was sold a few times ; primarily the ownership was held by the Robinsons , the <unk> , and the <unk> . None of the three families lived on the estate , which was at the time a farm worked by a string of lessees . 
 In 1897 John William Bain Hawkesworth sold part of the holding , keeping just the house and some land . The farm was known as Parsonage Farm from the middle of the 19th century , and continued to be tended until around 1960 . The property was purchased by the National Trust in 1946 , and some restoration work was conducted in 1967 . The complex of buildings was scheduled as an ancient monument in May 1951 , and the former chantry house was listed as a Grade I building in April 1961 . At the same time , the other buildings on site were listed as Grade II buildings : the gateway and wall , three barns ( one of which is ruined ) , a ruined outbuilding and a dovecote . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The buildings are constructed from Hamstone , a Jurassic limestone quarried on the local Ham Hill . 
 The priory itself is linked to a barn by a wall . It includes a gateway which provides access from North Street . The 5 metres ( 16 ft ) high wall dates from the 15th century and includes an arched gateway which has a buttress on its western side . The barn is largely from the 18th century ; however it incorporates material from the former building . The southern end is supported by two buttresses and the north side includes a door on the first floor . 
 The other barn which is about 25 metres ( 82 ft ) north west of The Priory was built in the 15th century . It has partially thatched roof , and served as a tithe barn . The other outbuilding which is about 40 metres ( 130 ft ) north west of The Priory may once have been used as a wagon shed . A further 15th century barn to the west of The Priory is now ruined , following a fire in 1969 . It is close to the circular Dovecote which may date from the 14th century . Pigeons and doves were an important food source historically kept for their eggs , flesh , and dung . 
 The main priory building itself is of an " L " shaped plan and consists of three unequal wings . The oldest part contains the hall , screens and dormitory . This was built in the 14th century but contains stones from the previous building , which show oblique tooling found in Norman architecture . The two @-@ storey hall is 28 feet ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) long and 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) wide . It was originally used as the refectory , with a window being added by Bishop Beckington in the 15th century , and later became a coal store . The hall also has arches into bays and an ogee @-@ headed recess which may have been an aumbry . At the eastern end of the hall is a parlour on the ground floor and , on the first floor , is a dormitory . The chapel next to the dormitory can be see through a squint which is unusually combined with a piscina . 
 The central block south of the hall contains the dining room and kitchen on the ground floor with bedrooms above . Both have chamfered beams made of elm which are approximately 19 feet ( 5 @.@ 8 m ) long . Centrally between the two rooms is a large medieval fireplace including a bread oven . Next to the kitchen is the large south store . 
 = Touchet Formation = 
 The Touchet Formation or Touchet beds consist of large quantities of gravel and fine sediment which overlay almost a thousand meters ( several thousand feet ) of volcanic basalt of the Columbia River Basalt Group in south @-@ central Washington and north @-@ central Oregon . The beds consist of between 6 and 40 distinct rhythmites - horizontal layers of sediment , each clearly demarcated from the layer below . These Touchet beds are often covered by windblown loess soils which were deposited later ; the number of layers varies with location . The beds vary in depth from 330 ft ( 100 m ) at lower elevations where a number of layers can be found to a few extremely thin layers at the maximum elevation where they are observed ( 1 @,@ 150 ft ( 350 m ) ) . 
 The Touchet beds are one element in a chain of evidence which helped identify and define the progression of the Missoula Floods , which occurred around 16 @,@ 450 to 13 @,@ 750 years BCE . During the floods , flow through the Wallula Gap was slow enough such that water pooled in a temporary lake , Lake Lewis . Lake Lewis back @-@ flooded up the Yakima , Walla Walla , Touchet and Tucannon River Valleys . In these relatively calm arms of the lake , the slack waters deposited the suspended materials eroded from the scabland regions north of Lake Lewis , and redeposited them in pronounced layers before receding . 
 = = Discovery and interpretation = = 
 Although visible along the Walla Walla and Touchet rivers , the Touchet Beds were not subjected to study until the early 20th century . They remain at the center of scientific analyses to characterize the Missoula Floods . 
 = = = Type locality = = = 
 The type locality for the Touchet Formation is the confluence of the Touchet River with the Walla Walla River , originally noted by Richard Foster Flint in 1938 . Numerous other exposures were subsequently identified throughout the basins of the former Lake Lewis and Lake Condon . Touchet @-@ equivalent slackwater deposits are also present in the Willamette Valley near Portland ( former Lake Allison ) . 
 = = = Early interpretation = = = 
 In 1923 J Harlen Bretz published a paper arguing that the channeled scablands in Eastern Washington were caused by massive flooding in the distant past . This view , which was seen as arguing for a Catastrophic explanation for the geologic development , which ran counter the then prevailing view of uniformitarianism , and Bretz 's views were initially decried . Bretz defended his theories , setting off a forty @-@ year debate over the Missoula Floods before Bretz ’ s view of a catastrophic flood finally prevailed . Waitt extended Bretz 's argument , arguing for a sequence of multiple Missoula Floods — 40 or more . Waitt 's proposal was based mainly on analysis from glacial lake bottom deposits in Ninemile Creek and the Touchet Formation deposits in Burlingame Canyon . This represented a move away from a single catastrophic flood toward a series of catastrophic floods , but with the flood source still ascribed to Glacial Lake Missoula . 
 The controversy whether the Channeled <unk> landforms were formed mainly by multiple periodic large floods or by a single grand @-@ scale cataclysmic flood from either late Pleistocene Glacial Lake Missoula or an unidentified Canadian source reappeared in 1999 . Shaw ’ s team reviewed the sedimentary sequences of the Touchet beds and concluded that the sequences do not automatically imply multiple floods separated by decades or centuries . Rather , they proposed that sedimentation in the Glacial Lake Missoula basin was the result of jökulhlaups draining into Lake Missoula from British Columbia to the north . Shaw 's team proposed that the rhythmic Touchet beds are the result of multiple pulses , or surges , within a single larger flood . In response , Atwater ’ s team observed that there is substantial evidence for multiple large floods , including evidence of mud cracks and animal burrows in lower layers of the Touchet beds , which were filled by sediment from later floods . 
 = = Causes = = 
 Recent scientific investigations support Waitt ’ s proposed separation of layers into records of sequential flood events . Although the various sources support temporal separation of floods , they do not definitively identify the source of water for all of the floods , though they all agree that Lake Missoula was source for at least some of them . 
 = = = Formation = = = 
 The Touchet beds are formed of sediment which deposited during the various Missoula Floods , around 16 @,@ 450 to 13 @,@ 750 BCE , and during the Bonneville Flood that occurred in approximately 12 @,@ 500 BCE . Another potential source for periodic flooding , still somewhat controversial , is flood release by jökulhlaups from subglacial lakes in British Columbia , but no specific source for these jökulhlaups has yet been identified . 
 During the floods , flow through the narrow Wallula Gap was restricted such that water pooled in a temporary lake , Lake Lewis , which formed in the lowlands of the Columbia Plateau . Lake Lewis <unk> up the Yakima , Walla Walla , Touchet and Tucannon River valleys . This flooding lasted for a period of 4 – 7 days . In the relatively calm arms of the lake , the slack waters were thick with suspended materials eroded from the scablands above . Some of the suspended materials settled out , creating thick Touchet Formation layers , or rhythmites , which are found throughout these valleys . The larger clasts settled out first , followed by the finer ones . This resulted in layers with graded bedding , or bedding in which the larger particles are at the bottom and the smaller ones are at the top . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 In 1980 , R. B. Waitt studied the Touchet Formation in the wall of the Burlingame Canyon west of Walla Walla , Washington , where he counted at least 41 distinct flood deposit layers . He postulated that these floods could occur only when glacial Lake Missoula existed , which estimates place at 16 @,@ 450 to 13 @,@ 750 BCE . More recent studies have used radiocarbon dating to establish the approximate ages of deposition for the various layers . 
 The side valleys were protected from the violent currents of the main channel ; as a result the flood strata laid down by earlier floods were not eroded away by subsequent floods , but were buried and preserved . The average period between flood episodes is estimated to be 20 to 60 years . The periodicity estimates are based on a number of constraints : 
 The time to recharge Lake Missoula depends upon the level at which the dam is breached releasing the flood as well as upon the adjusted precipitation rate in the drainages flowing into Lake Missoula . For the volumes which correspond to calculated maximum flow rates , this is estimated to take from 20 to 80 years . 
 <unk> orientations from beds of tephra ( volcanic ash ) that lie between the layers of the Touchet Formation show secular variation , which indicates that the beds must have been formed by many floods . The purity of the tephra suggests subaerial deposition ( the tephra could be mixed with the surrounding sediment if it was deposited in moving water ) , which indicates a dry period during the ash falls ( and hence a hiatus between floods ) . 
 Offshore deposits on the bed of the Pacific at the mouth of the Columbia River include 120 m ( 390 ft ) of material deposited over a several thousand year period that corresponds to the period of multiple scabland floods seen in the Touchet Beds . Since there are at least 40 floods , this would give an average separation between floods of 50 years . 
 The number of layers deposited varies with location in the Lake Lewis basin . This can best be understood as the result of multiple floods ; the variable levels correspond to Lake Missoula breaching the ice dam at varying lake levels , releasing different volumes of flood waters . This would suggest the time between floods is variable . 
 Flood beds in other locations upstream of Lake Lewis such as Ninemile Creek in Montana and the Sanpoil arm of glacial Lake Columbia show a corresponding regularity of flood deposits as well as deposit grading and rhythmical repetition to those in Lake Lewis . Since Glacial Lake Columbia remained filled , annual deposits ( varves ) can be observed between flood deposits . The flood deposits can be distinguished from annually deposited varves by both their thickness and the presence of materials foreign to the immediate drainage . Atwater reports from 35 to 55 annual varves between flood deposits in Lake Columbia , supporting a period of 35 to 55 years between ice dam failures . 
 Additional varve counts from the Lake Missoula Basin , Sanpoil River , and Latah Creek suggest that the time between floods was 30 @-@ 40 years on average .

 The Touchet Formation was originally identified at the confluence of the Touchet River with the Walla Walla River . It is also found at some distance up the Touchet River Valley . The number of layers observed decreases as one progresses up @-@ valley , indicating that the floodwater lakes varied in depth and distance upstream from the various flood dams . <unk> dike intrusions are observed in some locations penetrating the layers vertically ; the dikes are infilled with uniform @-@ size fine @-@ grained materials and are indications that the period between floods was long enough that the deposits dried , forming vertical cracks and allowing wind @-@ blown eroded materials to infill the cracks . 
 = = = Walla Walla river valley = = = 
 The Walla Walla River Valley is a closed basin . The river passes through a narrow gap near its confluence with the Columbia River and then widens into a broad open valley floor about 8 mi ( 13 km ) above the confluence with the Columbia . This area was filled to varying depths by the successive Missoula Floods , and sediments settled out to form the Touchet beds over much of the basin , creating what is today a fertile farmland region . In the lowest part of the broader valley , to the east of the Columbia River and west of the city of Walla Walla , Washington , soils commonly form on Touchet beds . In several locations erosion has exposed these beds . One outcrop , the Gardena Terrace segment of the rhythmites , can be seen along the highway west of Walla Walla . The Touchet Formation is also extensively exposed at Burlingame Canyon , just southwest of the town of Touchet near the confluence of the Touchet and Walla Walla Rivers . The deposits are also found along tributaries to the Walla Walla , extending some distance south into Oregon .

The Toppenish Basin and Benton Basin of the lower Yakima River both contain large amounts of Touchet Formation deposits . <unk> are extensively exposed 1 mi ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of Mabton and at <unk> .

 The Tucannon River and its tributary , the <unk> Creek also have valleys partially filled with alluvial deposits from the Missoula and Bonneville floods . Although they lie some distance up the Snake River drainage , the flood waters of Lake Lewis backed up this drainage far enough to deposit sediments . Floodplain deposits consist of up to six distinct Touchet Beds , as well as loess silt and fine sand . These alluvial and loess deposits narrow as they approach the basalt valley walls , and thicken into the central valley , with a maximum sediment thickness of between 20 and 100 ft ( 6 and 30 m ) . Due to the elevation of the valley , only six of the flooding events caused water to back into the Tucannon Valley in sufficient volume to deposit distinct layers .

 = Utah State Route 201 = 
 State Route 201 ( SR @-@ 201 ) is an east – west expressway and freeway located in Salt Lake County in the U.S. state of Utah . Colloquially known as the 21st South Freeway , the route serves as an alternative to Interstate 80 ( I @-@ 80 ) through Salt Lake City . From the western terminus of the route west of Magna , the highway heads east through Kennecott Copper property as an expressway before running through the western suburbs of Salt Lake City as a freeway . Shortly after the route returns on a surface route , SR @-@ 201 terminates on its eastern end at State Street ( U.S. Route 89 ) . 
 The history of the route predates the invention of the automobile ; the Donner Party , California Trail and Pony Express all followed the present @-@ day path of the highway . During the 1910s , the route was designated a state highway and , in 1939 , State Route 201 was officially written into law , running from Magna east to the mouth of Parley 's Canyon . At one point , the highway carried US @-@ 50 Alternate west of State Street and both US @-@ 40 and US @-@ 40 Alternate east of that road , though all were truncated from Salt Lake City by the late 1970s . Construction of the freeway portion of SR @-@ 201 west of I @-@ 15 commenced in the mid @-@ 1960s and was fully completed by 1986 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 At its western terminus , SR @-@ 201 begins at a partial interchange at I @-@ 80 . Heading generally east with two lanes in each direction , the expressway passes by the Kennecott Smokestack , the tallest structure in Utah . Past its intersection at SR @-@ 202 , the route takes a turn to the southeast , bypassing the Kennecott tailings pond . Now exiting Kennecott property , the route exits unpopulated terrain and enters the urban Wasatch Front , beginning with the Salt Lake City suburb of Magna . Past junctions at 9200 West , 8400 West , 8000 West and 7200 West , the route veers northerly three blocks and becomes a limited @-@ access freeway . East of 7200 West , SR @-@ 201 is routed at approximately 2100 South in Salt Lake County 's grid system , giving the freeway its nickname of " 21st South Freeway " . 
 Now with three lanes in each direction , the highway straddles the boundary between Salt Lake City and West Valley City , another suburb of the former . The road continues due east with diamond interchanges at 5600 West ( SR @-@ 172 ) and Bangerter Highway ( SR @-@ 154 ) . Immediately following a single @-@ point urban interchange ( SPUI ) at 3200 West , the freeway intersects I @-@ 215 in the form of a cloverleaf interchange . The road dips to the south slightly and , following two <unk> at Redwood Road ( SR @-@ 68 ) and 900 West , the freeway terminates at the Spaghetti Bowl interchange , giving eastbound motorists on SR @-@ 201 the option of continuing to I @-@ 15 , I @-@ 80 , 1300 South and 900 South . However , an eastbound traveler wanting to continue on the surface portion of SR @-@ 201 to State Street must exit on 900 West , head north briefly and then turn eastbound on 2100 South ; a westbound traveler on 2100 South wishing to connect to the freeway must take an on @-@ ramp from the surface street just before 900 West . Prior to 1997 , this connection was direct . Now on the four @-@ lane 2100 South , a secondary surface street , the route runs along the Salt Lake City @-@ South Salt Lake border . State maintenance of 2100 South ends at the intersection of State Street ( US @-@ 89 ) . 
 = = History = = 
 State Route 201 is one of the original highways through the Salt Lake Valley . Signs along the route claim the path of the highway to be the historical route of the California Trail , Pony Express and Lincoln Highway . While signed as the route of the California Trail , modern 2100 South is a less common branch called Hastings Cutoff that became infamous because of the Donner Party . The Lincoln Highway , generally derived from the route of the Pony Express across Utah , was routed on 2100 South . However , no modern highway exactly follows the route of the Pony Express west of Salt Lake City . SR @-@ 201 is one of a few auto @-@ tour routes that approximates the Pony Express trail , which actually ran south of the road . 
 In the 1910s , 2100 South in Salt Lake County became an unnumbered state highway . In 1919 , when the state legislature redefined the state road system to include only a short list given in the law and any federal aid projects , 2100 South east of State Street remained as a portion of the Lincoln Highway . In 1926 , 2100 South became part of US @-@ 40 , following the creation of the United States Numbered Highway system . By 1937 , 2100 South west of <unk> West was assigned to US @-@ 50 , US @-@ 40 now turning northward toward Downtown Salt Lake City . This created two signed highways over 2100 South : US @-@ 40 east of US @-@ 91 and US @-@ 50 east of 9200 West ( US @-@ 50 traveled west on 3500 South through Salt Lake City from US @-@ 91 to 2100 South in Magna , whereas US @-@ 40 turned from eastbound 2100 South to northbound State Street to connect to North Temple ) . 
 In 1939 , the state legislature designated State Route 201 , running west on 2100 South from State Street ( US @-@ 40 / US @-@ 91 ) to US @-@ 50 ( <unk> West ) in Magna . By 1954 , US @-@ 50 was moved south to an alignment through central Utah , the old routing mostly replaced by US @-@ 50 Alternate ( US @-@ 50A ) . However , US @-@ 50A was placed in Salt Lake City on 2100 South west of State Street , replacing the SR @-@ 201 designation . By 1965 , US @-@ 40 was realigned along Foothill Drive ( then US @-@ 40A ) , the Utah Highway Department believing the Foothill route was more direct in connecting with North Temple toward the airport . US @-@ 40A was now aligned along the entirety of 2100 South from US @-@ 40 / future I @-@ 215 at the mouth of Parley 's Canyon west to State Street and beyond with US @-@ 50A to US @-@ 40 west of Magna . Both mainline and Alternate US @-@ 40 , along with US @-@ 50A , were truncated to east of the city by 1979 . 
 = = = Constructing a freeway = = = 
 By 1958 , SR @-@ 201 between US @-@ 40 west of Magna and SR @-@ 68 ( Redwood Road ) was a two @-@ lane highway through rural Salt Lake County . The rural landscape changed by the time SR @-@ 201 intersected 300 West and entered urban Salt Lake County , the highway becoming a four @-@ lane road . The route remained this way until the intersection of 1300 East ( SR @-@ 181 ) , where the route reverted to a two @-@ lane configuration . By 1965 , a time when most U.S. Routes in the city were being replaced by Interstate Highways , all two @-@ lane portions of the road east of 1300 East were widened to at least four lanes ; an interchange between US @-@ 40 , US @-@ 40A and future I @-@ 215 was being built at the mouth of Parley 's Canyon . From under @-@ construction I @-@ 15 west to Redwood Road , the old route of SR @-@ 201 was being superseded by a six @-@ lane freeway directly to the south . All construction was complete by 1970 with interchanges at 900 West and Redwood Road ; the new freeway extended west to 2700 West . 
 By 1977 , an interchange directly west of Redwood Road at I @-@ 215 was being built and the rest of the highway to Magna was given a median in preparation for freeway construction to 5600 West ( SR @-@ 172 ) . This construction concluded by 1986 , with interchanges at 3200 West , Bangerter Highway ( SR @-@ 154 , then solely 4000 West ) and 5600 West as a result . Beginning in April 1997 and concluding in July 2001 , as part of a larger reconstruction project for I @-@ 15 , SR @-@ 201 was rebuilt from 900 West to I @-@ 15 / I @-@ 80 , including the colloquial " Spaghetti Bowl " interchange . As a result , SR @-@ 201 was left in two discontinuous pieces ; to connect from the surface portion of SR @-@ 201 to the freeway , one must now take an on @-@ ramp . From 2004 to 2006 , the freeway from 900 West to I @-@ 215 was widened and repaved , the Redwood Road interchange being redone as well . In 2009 , the freeway from Bangerter Highway to 5600 West was widened to three lanes in each direction and the road between SR @-@ 202 and I @-@ 80 was widened to four lanes — the latter project eliminated the final two @-@ lane section of SR @-@ 201 .

 = 1999 – 2000 S.L. Benfica season = 
 The 1999 – 2000 season was Sport Lisboa e Benfica 's 96th season in existence and the club 's 66th consecutive season in the top flight of Portuguese football . It ran from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 . Benfica competed domestically in the Primeira Liga and the Taça de Portugal . The club also participated in the UEFA Cup , by virtue of finishing third in that tournament the previous season . 
 After sacking Scottish coach Graeme Souness , Benfica appointed UEFA Champions League @-@ winning manager Jupp Heynckes . Limited by ongoing financial difficulties , the club signings consisted of players either on the books , free transfers or loans , such as with the Spaniards Chano and Tote , the former on a free deal , and the latter on loan . Tote arrived to replace Rushfeldt , who signed and practised with the team , before being recalled back by Rosenborg with disagreements over his transfer . Benfica started their campaign with a six @-@ game winning streak in their first seven league games , topping the league until December ; when a record @-@ setting loss to Celta de Vigo , the greatest in its history , negatively affected the team mentality , causing them to drop to third place in Matchday 19 , which would become their final position , finishing eight points behind Sporting , but securing a position in the upcoming season 's UEFA Cup . 
 In total Benfica won 21 league matches , drew 6 and lost 7 . Nuno Gomes was the season topscorer with 20 goals , of which 18 occurred in the Primeira Liga . 
 = = Summary = = 
 = = = Pre @-@ season = = = 
 After a season which saw Graeme Souness sacked , the club looked for more experience and chose Jupp Heynckes on 30 May . During a 20 @-@ year career , the German manager had won titles for Bayern Munich and Real Madrid and was the first manager in 32 years to clinch a European title for Madrid the previous year . 
 The pre @-@ season , which began in early July , included nine preparation matches in Portugal and abroad . From 18 to 31 July , the team played six matches against German teams . Their first game in Lisbon was against Bayern Munich on 10 August , and four days later they participated in the Trofeo Memorial Nereo Rocco against AC Milan . 
 Heynckes immediately requested signings in all three positions : defence , midfield and attack . Although the club scouted <unk> ( signed by Sporting ) and Claudio <unk> for the midfield , the only players to join the team were Maniche and Marco Freitas ( both on the club payroll and returning from one @-@ year loans to Alverca ) . For attack Benfica considered Barcelona player Giovanni ( who said , " It would be an honour for me to work with Heynckes " ) but ultimately signed Chano , a 34 @-@ year @-@ old Spanish player from CD Tenerife . 
 The club was involved in a transfer saga over Norwegian striker Rushfeldt . He signed and practised with the team but left after Rosenborg claimed there were financial issues related to his transfer . He was replaced by Tote , on loan from Real Madrid , with the club president saying that " Tote was always the first choice " and Rushfeldt " did not have the personality or mental strength to play for Benfica " . 
 Goalkeeper Michel Preud 'homme retired at age 39 . Arriving in 1994 , he made nearly 200 appearances over five seasons and became a fan favourite . Benfica hired two replacements : Argentine Carlos Bossio and German Robert Enke . Heynckes described Bossio as the " more experienced " goalkeeper , with " a great talent " , but also defining Enke as a " good , young goalkeeper ; a promise " . The Argentine had appearances on his national team and was the first choice at Estudiantes , while the German had its breakthrough at Borussia Mönchengladbach only a few months earlier . However , in a pre @-@ season game against Bayern Munich Bossio conceded two goals : " I am calm , although we lost the game and my performance led to some ' scolding ' . " Enke confidently stepped into the position : " If I do not make mistakes , there will be no reason to change goalkeepers . " 
 = = = August and September = = = 
 Benfica visited Vila do Conde for their opening Primeira Liga game on 22 August . Although Sérgio Nunes scored in the ninth minute , Hugo Henrique of the home team equalised it minutes later for a 1 – 1 draw . During the last week of August the Eagles hosted Salgueiros , scoring one goal and missing a number of opportunities to increase their lead . Record entitled its article " If the Spaniard was a goalscorer it would have been a slaughter " . 
 On 12 September Benfica visited Azores and beat Santa Clara 3 – 0 to move to top of the league table , tied with five other teams . Four days later the club started their European campaign , facing Dinamo Bucuresti at home . They lost 1 – 0 , when a shot by <unk> slipped through Enke 's legs . In the title race , the Eagles led the table after defeating Vitória Setúbal . Newspaper Record portrayed the game as easy win for the club , writing , " Nothing better to raise morale than to win comfortably , without rush , without pushing , without any problem whatsoever . " 
 Before their European game , the team travelled to Faro to defend their lead . They won their fourth consecutive match , with Nuno Gomes scoring his fourth goal in five games . At the end of September , Benfica travelled to Romania to play Dinamo Bucuresti . After a first @-@ half goal by Maniche , Chano scored in the 71st minute to send Benfica into second round . 
 = = = October and November = = = 
 The club 's momentum continued into October , when they defeated Estrela da Amadora with two second @-@ half goals ; Record summarized that the goals , " Finished the game off when it was most needed " . On 16 October Benfica visited Barcelos , and increased their lead to four points over second @-@ place FC Porto . In Europe , the club defeated <unk> in Greece , taking an advantage back to Portugal for the second leg . 
 In their eighth Primeira Liga match Benfica hosted Boavista F.C. , settling for a draw after <unk> scored in the 80th minute . It was the first time since late August that Benfica dropped points . For their last October game , they visited Alverca to face the local team , F.C. Alverca . Benfica lost their first league match ; with a display that Record characterized as being under a Halloween spell ; that resulted in " their worst performance of the season , and seeing Porto close in on the top of the table . " 
 On 4 November , Benfica hosted <unk> for the second leg of their European qualifier . They lost 2 – 1 in normal time , requiring extra time and a penalty shootout to decide the match . The Lisbon side converted all their shots , progressing into to the next round . Four days later , the club defeated S.C. Braga by one goal in a league match to open a three @-@ point lead . 
 After a one @-@ week break for the Taça de Portugal , Benfica visited Estádio das Antas for the Clássico against Porto . They lost 2 – 0 with goals from <unk> and Jardel , and the title @-@ holders reduced Benfica 's league lead to one point . In João Marcelino view , " The game between Porto and Benfica had to forcibly answer some questions — and it did not disappoint expectations . The easy win by Fernando Santos ' team clearly showed who still is , almost six years later , the best team in domestic football ; and the way that Jupp Heynckes accepted defeat could be used as evidence that he has been pushing his players to their current limit . " 
 The following Thursday , Benfica visited Vigo for the third round of the UEFA Cup . Benfica made club history in the match ; at half @-@ time they were already losing 4 – 0 , and three more goals in the second half broke the record for goals conceded , in their worst defeat ever . At their next training session hundreds of fans booed the team , and the club president compelled his players to apologize for their performance . Team captain João Pinto read a statement : " To Benfica , and to their supporters ; aware of the abnormality of the result from the match in Vigo ; the players , represented by the captain and vice @-@ captain , publicly acknowledge that they didn 't perform to club standards . We promise to redouble our commitment , towards dignifying this club . To them and to the millions of fans , we formally apologize . " November 's final game , a 2 – 0 victory over Campomaiorense , retained Benfica 's league lead . 
 = = = December and January = = = 
 Benfica began December with a draw against Belenenses , with Porto 's victory ensuring they surpassed Benfica in the league table . The team performance was at such a level that it allowed Record to claim , " The goalscoring chances could be counted on the fingers of a hand . " In the second leg of the UEFA Cup against Celta de Vigo , the Spaniards and Heynckes fielded lineups almost entirely composed of reserves and the match ended in a one @-@ all draw . On Matchday 14 , Benfica beat <unk> Leiria by 3 – 2 with " two freak goals ensuring a win . " , as Record put it . The final game of the year was a visit to Guimarães . Benfica scored first but allowed Vitória S.C. to come back , losing a third league match . They had not won outside Estádio da Luz since 16 October ( when they led by four points ) , and began the New Year four points behind the leader in third place . 
 The year started with a Derby de Lisboa at home . After a scoreless tie , Sporting CP benefited from the points @-@ share and Benfica fell to six points behind Porto . On 12 January the club hosted <unk> for the Portuguese Cup , scoring seven goals against the third @-@ tier team . Three days later , Benfica visited Funchal and nearly lost ; Record labelled Enke 's performance as crucial for Benfica , illustrating , " In the key moment of the game , when Enke defended a penalty in the 10th minute , he saved Benfica from leaving Funchal with a defeat . In a sluggish performance , only new signings Uribe and <unk> showed good form . " 
 On Matchday 18 , Benfica hosted Rio Ave , winning their first league game in a month . Four days later , Benfica again played Sporting for the Portuguese Cup . Losing 3 – 1 , the team were eliminated in their own stadium for the fourth time in club history ; the first three were by Sporting in 1962 – 63 , Braga in 1965 – 66 and Boavista in 1991 – 92 . Benfica ended January with three points away from home for the first time since October , after defeating Salgueiros 2 – 1 in the Vidal Pinheiro . 
 = = = February and March = = = 
 Now focused on the league , Benfica continued their momentum and defeated Santa Clara at home . Chano was decisive in unlocking the game in the perspective of Record : " He was the vitamin that gave imagination and clarity to Benfica 's midfield " . They won a fourth consecutive time , beating Vitória de Setúbal in Estádio do <unk> and gaining ground on Porto and Sporting ( both of whom lost points ) . On 22 February , the Eagles hosted Farense knowing that a win would put them one point behind the joint Primeira Liga leaders . 
 Benfica were surprised by the Faro side 's opposition . José Manuel Delgado wrote in his match report for Record : " Heynckes ' defence show [ ed ] inexplicable passivity , and <unk> was a loose threat that no one could stop . With an impressive performance , Farense made one , two and nearly three goals " . Shortly after the 15 @-@ minute mark the Angolan striker was injured and Farense threats stopped , allowing Benfica to turn the match around : " After his substitution Benfica started to settle in the midfield , better supporting the attack ... until Maniche put the threats in practise and scored in the 23rd and 38th minutes , with Nuno Gomes leaving Benfica in the lead before halftime " . For their last February match , Benfica visited Estádio José Gomes to face the local team , Estrela da Amadora . Two goals by <unk> and another by Kenedy gave them their first league loss since 19 December , with Porto and Sporting regaining a four @-@ point lead . 
 The Lisbon side rebounded with a home win against Gil Vicente F.C. ; José Manuel Delgado called the victory " convincing , with moments of good football " . The second game in March was at Estádio do Bessa . The match report in Record depicted Benfica 's performance as good to begin with ( " [ Benfica ] was better in the first half , scored first and stopped the Boavista press in the beginning of the second half " ) , until they conceded to Boavista before the final whistle : " [ Benfica ] receded , receded , until suffering a last @-@ minute goal by <unk> with Boavista reduced to ten men . " On Matchday 26 Benfica hosted Alverca , defeating them with a late goal by João Tomás and avenging October 's loss . The team ended March with a visit to Braga , undefeated by the Eagles since 1995 – 96 . Although Benfica led the game early , another late goal and their subsequent loss allowed both rivals to increase their lead . 
 = = = April and May = = = 
 On 1 April Benfica faced Porto in the second Clássico of the season , and a second @-@ half goal by Sabry helped the club defeat their historic rivals . Gomes Ferreira commented : " The game was perfect for a nil @-@ nil draw , when in the 67th minute a moment of genius decided the game : a great , meaningful goal from Saby , launching Benfica into the title race and hampering Porto " . Benfica maintained their momentum on a trip to the <unk> team , Campomaiorense . An early dismissal of José Soares helped them win easily , with Sabry scoring in a fourth consecutive game . 
 On 16 April Benfica hosted Lisbon rivals Belenenses , losing 3 @-@ 2 and dampening any championship hopes . A week later the team lost their second straight match ( their seventh defeat of the season ) to União de Leiria 2 – 1 , despite scoring first . On 30 April Benfica returned to top form , and in Miguel Costa Nunes opinion , defeated a " debilitated and riddled with internal conflicts " Vitória de Guimarães 3 – 0 . 
 In the penultimate game of the season , Benfica faced Sporting for the third time ; in their previous meetings , the club had tied once and lost once . Sporting , the league leader , was three points away from ending an 18 @-@ year drought dating to 1981 – 82 . A late goal by Sabry dashed their hopes , preventing them from winning the title from Benfica . In the aftermath of the game , Record reported in their headline : " Till the end : A late goal from Sabry completely froze the thousands of Sporting fans waiting to celebrate the title " , while O Jogo header read " Sabry causes short @-@ circuit in Alvalade " . Benfica ended the season with a third consecutive win , beating Madeira side Marítimo 2 – 1 . However , in José Ribeiro 's piece for Record , he wrote that Benfica " missed out on a thrashing that the fans and Marítimo deserved " . The club finished four points from a Champions League berth and eight behind Sporting , who won their long @-@ awaited title .

 The Missouri Fox Trotter is a horse breed from the state of Missouri in the United States . It was developed in the Ozark Mountains by settlers in the early 19th century , and quickly developed into a gaited breed appreciated for its stock horse abilities , stamina and smooth gaits . It performs an ambling gait known as the " fox trot " , a four @-@ beat broken diagonal gait in which the front foot of the diagonal pair lands before the hind , eliminating the moment of suspension and increasing smoothness . The main breed registry was begun in 1948 and as of 2012 registers almost 100 @,@ 000 horses . A European registry was begun in 1992 , and as of 2009 recognizes around 600 Fox Trotters living in Europe . In 2006 , a smaller registry , focused on the preservation of the original , historic type , was begun in the United States . The Fox Trotter is a mid @-@ sized , muscular breed , used mainly for trail riding and ranch work .

 Missouri Fox Trotters stand 14 to 16 hands ( 56 to 64 inches , 142 to 163 cm ) high , and weigh between 900 and 1 @,@ 200 pounds ( 410 and 540 kg ) . Begun in 2004 , the Missouri Fox Trotting Horse Breed Association also maintains a separate registry for fox trotting ponies standing between 11 and 14 hands ( 44 and 56 inches , 112 and 142 cm ) . Fox Trotters may be any solid color or pinto . White facial and leg markings are common . The facial profile is straight , set upon a neck of medium length than ends in pronounced withers . The breed is muscular , with sloped shoulders , a short back and sturdy legs . 
 The Missouri Fox Trotter performs an ambling gait known as the " fox trot " , which replaces the trot seen in many other breeds . The fox trot is a four @-@ beat broken diagonal gait in which the front foot of the diagonal pair lands before the hind , eliminating the moment of suspension and giving a smooth , sure @-@ footed ride . The gait is sometimes described as having the horse walk with the front feet and trot with the back . In a fox trot , the horse must keep one front foot on the ground at all times and display a sliding motion with the hind legs . The fox trot and the regular trot are both at a speed between a walk and a canter or gallop ; ambling gaits are four @-@ beat gaits , whereas the trot is a two @-@ beat gait . The extra footfalls provide additional smoothness to a rider because the horse always has at least one foot on the ground . This minimizes movement of the horse 's topline and removes the bounce of a two @-@ beat gait , caused by a moment of suspension followed by the jolt of two feet hitting the ground as the horse shifts from one pair of legs to the other . The value of an intermediate speed is that the horse conserves energy . More than thirty horse breeds are " gaited , " able to perform a four @-@ beat ambling gait ; some can also trot . A Missouri Fox Trotter , with rider , can maintain a speed of 5 to 8 miles per hour ( 8 @.@ 0 to 12 @.@ 9 km / h ) while using the fox trot , and can cover short distances at up to 10 miles per hour ( 16 km / h ) . In comparison , the average medium trot speed is 6 to 8 miles per hour ( 9 @.@ 7 to 12 @.@ 9 km / h ) . 
 = = History = = 
 The Missouri Fox Trotter was developed from equine stock , including gaited horses , brought to Missouri by settlers from Tennessee , Kentucky and Virginia . Breeds that contributed to the Fox Trotter included the Arabian , Morgan , American Saddlebred , Tennessee Walking Horse and Standardbred . By the time of Missouri 's statehood in 1821 , the horses of the state were known for their unique gait , which was useful in the rocky terrain of the Ozark Mountains . The breed became popular with cattlemen for their smooth gaits and ability to work with cattle . In 1948 , the Missouri Fox Trotting Horse Breed Association ( MFTHBA ) was founded in Ava , Missouri , with an open stud book that registered all horses with the fox trot gait and other specified physical characteristics . The first Fox Trotters were exported to Europe in the 1950s , when the Queen of England imported several palomino @-@ colored horses . 
 In 1982 , the stud book was closed , allowing only horses from registered parents to be entered . The Fox Trotter became the official state horse of Missouri in 2002 . Missouri Fox Trotters are seen throughout the United States , as well as in Canada and several European countries , and as of 2012 the MFTHBA had registered over 97 @,@ 000 horses and counts over 8 @,@ 000 current members . 
 In 1992 , the European Missouri Fox Trotting Horse Association ( <unk> ) was formed as the Fox Trotter association for Europe and an affiliate of the MFTHBA . The first European Championship Show for the breed took place in 1996 , and in 2010 the <unk> and the Free University of Berlin began working together to start a European stud book for the breed . As of 2009 there were approximately 600 Missouri Fox Trotters in Europe , with around 350 of these living in Germany . 
 In 2006 , a new registry , the Foundation <unk> Heritage Association ( <unk> ) , was formed with a goal of preserving and promoting the original heritage type of Fox Trotter that was seen in the first 20 years of the MFTHBA registry , in large part through reducing the amount of Tennessee Walking Horse blood . The Tennessee Walker did not figure prominently in original Missouri Fox Trotter pedigrees , and so the <unk> , by restricting the amount of Walker blood , is attempting to develop horses that more closely resemble the original Fox Trotter type . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Missouri Fox Trotters are used extensively by trail riders , who appreciate their gaits , stamina and weight @-@ carrying abilities . They are also used in handicapped riding programs , and their smooth gait has proven useful for riders with minor physical disabilities . Crosses between Fox Trotter mares and donkey jacks are often made , creating mules with the fox trot gait that are used to carry hunters and trail riders , especially in the western United States . The US Forest Service also employs Fox Trotters for their speed , stamina and gait , and members of the breed were used to make the first horse @-@ back descent of the north rim of the Grand Canyon . 
 = Chyna = 
 Chyna ( born Joan Marie Laurer ; December 27 , 1969 – c . April 20 , 2016 ) was an American professional wrestler , glamour model , pornographic film actress , and bodybuilder . 
 Chyna first rose to prominence in the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF , now WWE ) in 1997 , where she was billed as the " Ninth Wonder of the World " ( André the Giant was already billed as the eighth ) . A founding member of the stable D @-@ Generation X as the promotion 's first female enforcer , she held the WWF Intercontinental Championship ( the only female performer to do so ) twice and the WWF Women 's Championship once . She was also the first woman to participate in the Royal Rumble and King of the Ring events , as well as to become number one contender to the WWF Championship . With singles victories over several prominent male wrestlers – including multiple @-@ time world champions Triple H , Kurt Angle , Chris Jericho and Jeff Jarrett – Chyna left what WWE called " a lasting legacy as the most dominant female competitor of all time " . After leaving the WWF in 2001 , Chyna wrestled sporadically , with New Japan Pro Wrestling ( NJPW ) in 2002 and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) in 2011 . 
 Outside of wrestling , Chyna appeared in Playboy magazine twice , as well as numerous television shows and films . In 2005 , she was a cast member on VH1 's The Surreal Life , which led to several other celebrity reality appearances on the network , including The Surreal Life : Fame Games in 2007 and Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew in 2008 . She is also known for her tumultuous relationship with fellow wrestler Sean Waltman , with whom she made a sex tape released commercially in 2004 as 1 Night in China , which won a 2006 AVN Award for Best @-@ Selling Title .

 = = Early life = = 
 Laurer was born in Rochester , New York on December 27 , 1969 . She had two older siblings : Kathy and Sonny . 
 After her parents divorced when she was approximately four years old , Laurer had three different stepfathers and one stepmother . According to Laurer , her first stepfather threatened suicide at one point , and her biological father , who once accidentally stabbed her mother in the thigh with a bread knife , had a problem with alcoholism . From 1973 to 1983 , she , her siblings and her mother moved several times . 
 As a child , Laurer learned to play both the violin and cello . She later said that in seventh grade she was sexually kissed by a much older teacher who worked at her school . At age thirteen , while attending Penfield High School , she began purging after she ate . She left home at age sixteen after her mother tried to force her into a drug rehabilitation facility , going instead to live with her biological father . That same year , she began working out , and because her abdominal muscles were so strong , she did not feel any pain when she developed an ovarian tumor . She finished her last year of high school in Spain . 
 She attended the University of Tampa , graduating in 1992 with a major in Spanish Literature . During college , she also studied French and German ( she could converse in either language ) and later stated during this time she was raped by two men after getting drunk at a party . She also was a member of the ROTC . She originally wanted to use her knowledge of foreign languages to work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation or Drug Enforcement Administration . Subsequently , she joined the Peace Corps and was assigned to Guatemala . 
 After returning from abroad , Laurer held several different jobs : a cocktail waitress in a strip club , singer in a band , and a 900 @-@ number chat line worker . In her mid @-@ to @-@ late 20s , while living in the Florida Keys , she took a six @-@ week class to train to be a flight attendant . On the way to her first flight , she was in a car accident and spent four days in the hospital . After recovering from the accident , Laurer 's sister Kathy helped her get a job selling beepers , and both women also worked as belly dancers . 
 After college , Laurer began to regularly enter fitness competitions . In 1996 , Laurer competed in the New York City regional level of the Fitness America competition . Because of her large size compared to the other women , she usually finished in last place .

 Joanie Laurer trained at <unk> " Killer " Kowalski 's professional wrestling school in Malden , Massachusetts . Her first match was in 1995 against a male wrestler dressed as a woman . While attending the school , she also worked for various independent promotions as Joanie Lee . Some of her earliest matches were set up by The Fabulous Moolah . 
 Laurer met World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) performers Paul " Triple H " Levesque and Shawn Michaels after a professional wrestling show in 1996 . After watching tapes of her matches , they decided to bring her into the WWF as a bodyguard . Vince McMahon , the owner of the WWF , initially did not want her to join the company because he did not believe the audience would find a woman beating up men believable . While waiting for the WWF 's decision , Laurer was approached by World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) , who wanted her to be the sole @-@ female member of the New World Order . She initially accepted the offer , but later turned it down when Shane McMahon , Vince McMahon 's son , informed her that she was about to be hired by the WWF . However , Kowalski claimed that he got Laurer hired by the WWF after introducing her to Shane McMahon and telling him of WCW 's interest in her .

 Laurer made her WWF debut on February 16 , 1997 at In Your House 13 : Final Four ; her character emerged as a plant from a ringside seat , choking Marlena while Goldust was in the ring with Triple H. Her original role in the promotion was as the laconic enforcer / bodyguard for Triple H and later , his D @-@ Generation X group ( which included Sean " X @-@ Pac " Waltman ) . She often helped Triple H ( then , a rising villain ) cheat to win by physically interfering in matches by executing her trademark low blow to the groin . She was later given the ring name " Chyna " , an intentionally ironic moniker ; fine china is delicate and fragile , a sharp contrast to her character . Off @-@ screen , however , the male wrestlers were hesitant at first to let a female over @-@ power them on @-@ screen . 
 In January 1999 , Chyna was the thirtieth entrant in the Royal Rumble , becoming the first woman ever to enter the contest . The day after the Royal Rumble , Chyna became a villainess by betraying Triple H and aligning herself with his enemy Vince McMahon and Kane . Laurer teamed with Kane at the St. Valentine 's Day Massacre pay @-@ per @-@ view against former allies X @-@ Pac and Triple H. At WrestleMania XV , Chyna turned on Kane in his match by attacking him with a chair , appearing to rejoin DX . Chyna and Triple H , however , turned against DX later that evening when they helped Shane McMahon defeat DX member X @-@ Pac . The duo became part of The Corporation and later Shane McMahon 's Corporate Ministry . Following the dissolution of the Corporate Ministry , the villainous Chyna remained at Triple H 's side . They would eventually split up later in the year .

 In June 1999 , Chyna became the first woman to qualify for the King of the Ring tournament . She was also the first female to be the number one contender for the WWF Championship , but lost the spot to Mankind before SummerSlam in August . Later that year , Laurer became a fan favorite again during her long feud with Jeff Jarrett . At Unforgiven , she had a match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship against Jarrett , which she lost . She defeated Jarrett for the title at No Mercy in his last WWF match , a Good Housekeeping match , on October 17 at No Mercy , in the process becoming the first and only woman to win the Intercontinental Championship . She also gained the services of his valet , Miss Kitty . Laurer claims that Jarrett demanded ( and received ) $ 300 @,@ 000 from Vince McMahon in order to lose the title cleanly to a woman . His contract had expired on October 16 , and he was therefore not contractually obligated to appear on the pay @-@ per @-@ view . If he had not appeared , the WWF would have been criticized for false advertising , and the lineage of the title would have been broken . 
 Chyna then feuded with Chris Jericho over the belt , defeating him at the Survivor Series , but losing the title to him at Armageddon . The two faced off again in a match on the edition of December 28 of SmackDown ! , which ended controversially with both wrestlers pinning each other . As a result , then " head of authority " Stephanie McMahon @-@ Helmsley declared them co @-@ champions . At the Royal Rumble , Jericho and Chyna defended the title against Hardcore Holly in a Triple Threat match to determine the Intercontinental Champion , which Jericho won ; Chyna 's " co @-@ champions " reign is no longer recognized by WWE and is now considered a continuation of Jericho 's second Intercontinental reign . Afterwards , Laurer briefly teamed with Jericho .

 Not long after losing the Intercontinental title , Laurer became the on @-@ screen girlfriend of Eddie Guerrero . Guerrero and Laurer , originally villains , later became fan favorites during the summer of 2000 , with Guerrero dubbing her his " Mamacita " . The couple faced Val Venis and then @-@ rookie Trish Stratus in an intergender tag team match at SummerSlam with the Intercontinental Championship on the line . Chyna won the match , but lost the belt two weeks later to Guerrero in a Triple Threat match with Kurt Angle . They officially split in November 2000 after Chyna , in storyline , found Eddie cavorting in the shower with two other women . 
 At the same time , Laurer posed nude for Playboy magazine 's November 2000 issue . Her Playboy modeling was also worked into a WWE storyline ( based , in part , on a real @-@ life legal feud between the WWE and the conservative Parents Television Council ) , in which it drew the ire of the Right to Censor ( a group of morally conservative wrestlers ) . Shortly after , Laurer began a feud with Ivory , a member of the Right to Censor , over the Women 's Championship . This culminated in a storyline at the Royal Rumble where Laurer appeared to <unk> her neck while performing a handspring back elbow . In order to better convince the audience that she was injured , color commentator Jerry Lawler left the commentators ' booth and entered the ring to check on Laurer 's condition , something he had not done since the in @-@ ring accident that killed Owen Hart in 1999 . When Laurer returned from the " injury " , she won the Women 's Championship from Ivory at WrestleMania X @-@ Seven in a squash match . Laurer also defended her title against Lita at Judgment Day in 2001 . Although she won the match , she soon vacated the Women 's Championship , as this was Laurer 's final WWF match . 
 She left the WWF on November 30 , 2001 , several months after she had been taken off of television . Behind the scenes , Triple H , her former real @-@ life boyfriend , began a relationship with Stephanie McMahon , with whom Laurer claims he had an affair and then left her for . Chyna , in a 2015 interview with Vince Russo , stated that after a meeting with Vince McMahon about the Stephanie McMahon situation , she was sent home and was later sent a fax telling her that she was not needed anymore , although in a 2002 interview with The Baltimore Sun , Chyna indicated that the breakup had nothing to do with her leaving WWF and that she left to pursue an acting career . Then @-@ Executive Vice President of Talent Relations Jim Ross reports that it was " mutually agreed " to let her contract expire in order for her to explore other options .

After losing to Masahiro Chono on October 14 , 2002 , Laurer performed her final match on October 26 , teaming with a fake Great Muta played by Troy Enders in a loss to Hiroshi Tanahashi and Kenzo Suzuki .

 Numerous commentators have credited Chyna as being influential to women 's wrestling and one of the biggest stars of WWE 's Attitude Era . Commentator and former WWE official Jim Ross described Chyna as " The distinctive athlete was to WWE what Ronda Rousey has been to UFC " , while E ! News said that Chyna accomplished more in her near @-@ decade career than any woman had ever done . Others praise Chyna as a feminist icon who defied gender norms ; Dawn <unk> , a professor of women 's and gender studies at the University of Louisville , wrote in 2004 that " She was demonized as a feminist who challenged male dominance ... Her latest , and most popular incarnation was that of a sex symbol " . She was the first woman to compete in the Royal Rumble match and is the only woman to have held the WWE Intercontinental Championship . Independent wrestler Kimber Lee credits Chyna as her influence to get into wrestling . 
 Columnist Mike <unk> of The Post and Courier stated that it is an " an oft @-@ asked question " as to when Chyna will be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame . Jim Ross said that Chyna had an " overwhelming desire " to be inducted during her lifetime . On February 9 , 2015 , during a WWE Network podcast with Stone Cold Steve Austin , Triple H mentioned that Chyna deserved to be in the Hall of Fame but that problems with children Googling her prohibited it . The day following her death , a post on WWE.com expressed sadness about it and featured a video of her winning the Women 's Championship . In an interview with The Daily Mirror shortly after her death , Triple H said that she " definitely warranted " a place in the Hall of Fame . The following month , Stephanie McMahon said she was sure Chyna would be inducted but was not sure what year it would happen . WWE played a video tribute in her memory on the April 25 episode of Raw .

 = Heathenry ( new religious movement ) = 
 Heathenry , also termed Heathenism or Germanic Neopaganism , is a modern Pagan religion . Classified as a new religious movement , its practitioners model their faith on the pre @-@ Christian belief systems adhered to by the Germanic peoples of Iron Age and Early Medieval Europe . To reconstruct these past belief systems , Heathenry uses surviving historical , archaeological , and folkloric evidence as a basis , although approaches to this material vary considerably . Heathen communities are currently present in various parts of Europe , the Americas , and Australasia . 
 Although lacking a unified theology , Heathenry is typically polytheistic , centering on a pantheon of deities from pre @-@ Christian Germanic Europe which includes both gods and goddesses . It adopts cosmological views from these pre @-@ Christian religions , including an animistic view of the cosmos in which the natural world is imbued with spirits . The faith 's deities and these spirits are honored in sacrificial rites known as blóts in which food and libations are offered to them . These are often accompanied by <unk> , the act of ceremonially toasting the gods with an alcoholic beverage . Some practitioners also engage in rituals designed to induce an altered state of consciousness and visions , most notably seiðr and galdr , with the intent of gaining wisdom and advice from the deities . Although there are many solitary practitioners who follow the religion alone , members of the Heathen community often assemble in small groups , usually known as kindreds or hearths , to perform their rites in specially constructed buildings or outdoors . Heathen ethical systems place great emphasis on honor , personal integrity , and loyalty , while beliefs about an afterlife are varied and rarely emphasized . 
 The primary division within the Heathen movement surrounds the issue of race . Many groups eschew racialist ideas , adopting a universalist perspective which holds that the religion is open to all , irrespective of ethnic or racial identity . Conversely , others adopt a racialist attitude – termed " folkish " within the community – by viewing Heathenry as a religion with intrinsic links to a Nordic race that should be reserved explicitly for white people of Northern European descent . Some folkish Heathens further combine the religion with explicitly racist and white supremacist perspectives . Although the term " Heathenry " is used widely to describe the religion as a whole , many groups prefer different forms of designation , influenced by their regional focus and their attitude to race . While a number of groups venerating Scandinavian deities use Ásatrú or Forn Sed , those focusing on Anglo @-@ Saxon deities use <unk> , and those adopting folkish perspectives tend to favor the terms Odinism or Wotanism . 
 The religion 's origins lie in the 19th and early 20th century Romanticist movement which glorified the pre @-@ Christian beliefs of Germanic societies . Organised groups venerating the Germanic gods developed in Germany and Austria , which were often part of the Völkisch movement and which typically exhibited a racialist interpretation of the religion , resulting in the movement largely dissolving following the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II . In the 1970s , new Heathen groups emerged in Europe and North America , developing themselves into formalized organizations in order to promote their faith . In recent decades , the Heathen movement has been the subject of academic study by scholars active in the field of Pagan studies . 
 = = Definition = = 
 Scholars of religious studies classify Heathenry as a new religious movement , and more specifically as a <unk> form of modern Paganism . Heathenry is " movement to revive and / or reinterpret for the present day the practices and worldviews of the pre @-@ Christian cultures of northern Europe ( or , more particularly , the Germanic speaking cultures ) " , and its practitioners seek to revive these past belief systems using surviving historical source materials . Sources used by Heathens include Scandinavian and Icelandic Old Norse texts like the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda , as well as texts from continental Europe like the Nibelungenlied and Anglo @-@ Saxon sources like Beowulf . Some also make use of folk tales and folklore from later periods in European history , as well as taking ideas from archaeological evidence . The textual sources used are often fragmentary and composed within Christian contexts , thus making it problematic for Heathens seeking to use them to " reconstruct " the pre @-@ Christian prehistoric and Medieval belief systems which they discuss . Thus , anthropologist Jenny Blain characterised Heathenry as " a religion constructed from partial material " , while religious studies scholar Michael Strmiska referred to it as a " postmodern movement " with beliefs that are " riddled with uncertainty and historical confusion " . 
 The ways in which Heathens use this historical and archaeological material differs ; some seek to reconstruct past beliefs and practices as accurately as possible , while others openly experiment with this material and embrace new innovations . Some , for instance , adapt their practices according to " unverified personal gnosis " ( UPG ) that they have gained through spiritual experiences . Others adopt concepts from the world 's surviving ethnic religions as well as modern polytheistic faiths such as Hinduism and Afro @-@ American religions , believing that doing so helps to construct spiritual world @-@ views that are akin to those that existed in Europe prior to Christianization . Other practitioners who emphasize a hard <unk> approach that relies exclusively on historical and archaeological sources criticize such attitudes , denigrating those who practice them using the pejorative term Neo @-@ Heathen . 
 Some Heathens seek out common elements that were found throughout Germanic Europe during the Iron Age and Early Medieval periods , using those as the basis for their contemporary beliefs and practices . Conversely , others draw inspiration from the beliefs and practices of a specific area and time , such as Anglo @-@ Saxon England or Viking Age Iceland . Some adherents are deeply knowledgeable as to the specifics of Northern European society in the Iron Age and Early Medieval periods , although most practitioners primarily gain their information about the pre @-@ Christian past from fictional literature and popular accounts of Norse mythology , and sectors of the Heathen movement have perpetuated misconceptions about the past . Many express a romanticized view of Nordic culture , with sociologist of religion Jennifer Snook noting that many practitioners " hearken back to a more epic , anachronistic , and pure age of ancestors and heroes " . As religious studies scholar Fredrik Gregorius stated , despite the fact that " no real continuity " exists between Heathenry and the pre @-@ Christian belief systems of Germanic Europe , Heathen practitioners often dislike being considered adherents of a " new religion " and " modern invention " and thus prefer to depict theirs as a " traditional faith " . Many practitioners avoid using the etic term " <unk> " to describe their practices , preferring to characterize it as an " indigenous religion " with parallels to the traditional belief systems of the world 's indigenous peoples . 
 = = = Terminology = = = 
 No central religious authority exists to impose a particular terminological designation on all practitioners . Hence , different Heathen groups have used different words to both describe their religion and themselves , with these terms often conveying meaning about the particular pre @-@ Christian Germanic belief systems from which they draw inspiration as well as their socio @-@ political leanings . 
 Academics studying the religion have typically favoured the terms Heathenry and Heathenism to describe it , for the reason that these words are " inclusive of all varieties " of the movement . This term is the most commonly used option by practitioners in the United Kingdom , with growing usage in North America and elsewhere . These terms are based on the word heathen , which was used by Early Medieval Christian writers to describe non @-@ Christians in Germanic Europe ; by using it , practitioners seek to <unk> it from the Christians as a form of self @-@ designation . Many practitioners favor the term Heathen over Pagan because the former term originated among Germanic languages , whereas Pagan has its origins in Latin . 
 A further term used in some academic contexts is Germanic Neopaganism , although this is an " artificial term " . Alternately , Blain suggested the use of North European Paganism as an overarching etic term for the movement , although Strmiska noted that this would also encompass those practitioners inspired by the belief systems of Northeastern Europe 's linguistically Finnic and Slavic societies . He favored Modern Nordic Paganism , although accepted that this term alienated those focusing on Anglo @-@ Saxon and continental Germanic belief systems . 
 Another name for the faith is the Icelandic Ásatrú , which is more commonly rendered as Asatru in North America ; this term translates as " allegiance to the Æsir " – the Æsir being a sub @-@ set of deities in Norse mythology – with practitioners being known as Asatruer . This term is favored by practitioners who focus on the deities of Scandinavia , although is problematic as many self @-@ identified Asatruer worship deities and entities other than the Æsir , such as the Vanir , valkyries , elves , and dwarves . Although initially a popular term of designation among practitioners and academics , usage of Ásatrú has declined as the religion has aged . Other practitioners term their religion <unk> , meaning " those who honor the Vanir " , or <unk> , meaning " those who honor the goddesses " , depending on their particular theological emphasis . Although restricted especially to Scandinavia , since the mid @-@ 2000s a term that has grown in popularity is Forn <unk> or Forn Sed ( " the old way " ) ; this is also a term reappropriated from Christian usage , having previously been used in a derogatory sense to describe pre @-@ Christian religion in the Old Norse Heimskringla . Other terms used within the community to describe their religion are the Northern Tradition , Norse Paganism , and Saxon Paganism , while in the first third of the 20th century , commonly used terms were German , Nordic , or Germanic Faith . 
 Many racialist @-@ oriented Heathens prefer the terms Odinism or Wotanism to describe their religion . There is thus a general view that all those who use Odinism adopt an explicitly political , right @-@ wing and racialist interpretation of the religion , while Asatru is used by more moderate Heathen groups , however no such clear division of these terms ' usage exists in practice . Gregorius noted that Odinism was " highly problematic " because it implies that the god Odin – who is adopted from Norse mythology – is central to these groups ' theology , which is often not the case . Moreover , the term is also used by at least one non @-@ racialist group , the British <unk> , who use it in reference to their particular dedication to Odin .

 The historian of religion Mattias Gardell noted that there is " no unanimously accepted theology " within the Heathen movement . Older Heathen groups , operating in the early 20th century , were often monotheistic , although today Heathenry is typically polytheistic , exhibiting a theological structure which includes a pantheon of gods and goddesses , with adherents offering their allegiance and worship to some or all of them . Most practitioners are polytheistic realists , believing in the literal existence of the deities as individual entities . Others express a psychological interpretation of the divinities , viewing them for instance as symbols , Jungian archetypes or racial archetypes , with some who adopt this position deeming themselves to be atheists . 
 Heathenry 's deities are adopted from the pre @-@ Christian belief systems found in the various societies of Germanic Europe ; they include divinities like Týr , Odin , Thor , Frigg and Freyja from Scandinavian sources , Wōden , Thunor and <unk> from Anglo @-@ Saxon sources , and figures such as <unk> from continental sources . Some practitioners adopt the belief , taken from Norse mythology , that there are two sets of deities , the Æsir and the Vanir . Certain practitioners blend the different regions and times together , for instance using a mix of Old English and Old Norse names for the deities , while others keep them separate and only venerate deities from a particular region . Some groups focus their veneration on a particular deity ; for instance , the Brotherhood of Wolves , a Czech Heathen group , center their worship on the deity Fenrir . Similarly , many practitioners in the U.S. adopt a particular patron deity for themselves , and describe themselves as that entity 's devotee using terms such as <unk> or <unk> . 
 Heathen deities are not seen as perfect , omnipotent , and omnipresent , and are instead viewed as having their own strengths and weaknesses , with many practitioners believing that these deities will one day die , as did , for instance , the god Baldr in Norse mythology . Heathens view their connection with their deities as not being that of a master and servant but rather an interdependent relationship akin to that of a family . For them , these deities serve as both examples and role models whose behavior is to be imitated . Many practitioners believe that they can communicate with these deities , as well as negotiate , bargain , and argue with them , and it is hoped that through venerating them , practitioners will gain wisdom , understanding , power , or visionary insights . 
 Many practitioners combine their polytheistic world @-@ view with a pantheistic conception of the natural world as being sacred and imbued with a divine energy force permeating all life . Heathenry is animistic , with practitioners believing in nonhuman spirit persons commonly known as " wights " ( <unk> ) that inhabit the world , each of whom is believed to have its own personality . Some of these are known as <unk> " land spirits " and inhabit different aspects of the landscape , living alongside humans , whom they can both help and hinder . Others are deemed to be household deities and live within the home , where they can be propitiated with offerings of food . Some Heathens interact with these entities and provide offerings to them more often than they do with the gods and goddesses . <unk> are often identified with various creatures from Northwestern European folklore such as elves , dwarves , gnomes , and trolls . However , some of these entities – such as the <unk> of Norse mythology – are deemed to be baleful spirits ; within the community it is often deemed taboo to provide offerings to them , although some practitioners still do so . Many Heathens also believe in and respect ancestral spirits . 
 = = = Cosmology and afterlife = = = 
 Heathens commonly adopt a cosmology based in Norse mythology in which our world – known as Midgard – is one of nine realms , all of which are part of a cosmological world tree called Yggdrasil . Different types of being are believed to inhabit these different realms ; for instance , humans live on Midgard , while dwarves live on another realm , elves on another , giants on another , and the divinities live on two further realms . Most practitioners believe that this is a poetic or symbolic description of the cosmos , with the different realms representing higher realms beyond the material plane of existence . The World Tree is also interpreted by some in the community as an icon for ecological and social engagement . Some Heathens , such as the psychologist Brian Bates , have adopted an approach to this cosmology rooted in analytical psychology , thereby interpreting the nine worlds and their inhabitants as maps of the human mind . 
 According to a common Heathen belief based on references in Old Norse sources , three sisters known as the Norns sit at the end of the World Tree 's root . These figures spin Wyrd , which refers to the actions and interrelationships of all beings throughout the cosmos . In the community , these three figures are sometimes termed " Past , Present and Future " , " Being , Becoming , and Obligation " or " Initiation , Becoming , Unfolding " . It is believed that an individual can navigate through the Wyrd , and thus , the Heathen worldview oscillates between concepts of free will and fatalism . Heathens also believe in a personal form of Wyrd known as <unk> . This is connected to an emphasis on luck , with Heathens in the U.S. often believing that luck can be earned , passed down generations , or lost . 
 Various Heathen groups adopt the Norse apocalyptic myth of Ragnarök , however few view it as a literal prophecy of future events . Instead it is often treated as a symbolic warning of the danger that humanity faces if it acts unwisely in relation to both itself and the natural world . The death of the gods at Ragnarok is often viewed as a reminder of the inevitability of death and the importance of living honourably and with integrity until one dies . Alternately , ethnonationalist Heathens have interpreted Ragnarok as a prophecy of a coming apocalypse in which the white race will overthrow what these Heathens perceive as their oppressors and establish a future society based on Heathen religion . Political scientist Jeffrey Kaplan believed that it was the " strongly millenarian and <unk> overtones " of Ragnarok which helped convert American racialists to the right @-@ wing end of the Heathen movement . 
 Some practitioners do not emphasize belief in an afterlife , instead stressing the importance of behaviour and reputation in this world . In Icelandic Ásatrú , there is no singular dogmatic belief about the afterlife . A common Heathen belief is that a human being has multiple souls , which are separate yet linked together . It is common to find a belief in four or five souls , two of which survive bodily death : one of these , the hugh , travels to the realm of the ancestors , while the other , the fetch , undergoes a process of reincarnation into a new body . In Heathen belief , there are various realms that the hugh ; can enter , based in part on the worth of the individual 's earthly life ; these include the hall of Valhalla , ruled over by Odin , or Sessrúmnir , the hall of Freyja . Beliefs regarding reincarnation vary widely among Heathens , although one common belief is that individuals are reborn within their family or clan . 
 = = = Morality and ethics = = = 
 In Heathenry , moral and ethical views are based on the perceived ethics of Iron Age and Early Medieval North @-@ West Europe , in particular the actions of heroic figures who appear in Old Norse sagas . Evoking a life @-@ affirming ethos , Heathen ethics focus on the ideals of honor , courage , integrity , hospitality , hard work , and strongly emphasize loyalty to family . It is common for practitioners to be expected to keep their word , particularly sworn oaths . There is thus a strong individualist ethos focused around personal responsibility , and a common motto within the Heathen community is that " We are our deeds " . 
 In North America and elsewhere , some Heathen communities have formalized such values into an ethical code , the Nine Noble Virtues ( NNV ) , which is based largely on the Hávamál from the Poetic Edda . There are different forms of the NNV , with the number nine having symbolic associations in Norse mythology . There is a divided opinion on the NNV ; some practitioners deem them too dogmatic , while others eschew them for not having authentic roots in historical Germanic culture , negatively viewing them as an attempt to imitate the Judeo @-@ Christian Ten Commandments . The NNV are not universal among Heathens , and it has for instance been noted that they are rare among Swedish practitioners . 
 Due to its focus on family ties and honest living – values perceived as socially conservative in Western nations – it has been noted that American Heathenry 's ethical system is far closer to traditional Christian morals than the ethical systems espoused in many other Western Pagan religions such as Wicca . Within the Heathen community of the United States , gender roles are based upon perceived ideals and norms found in Early Medieval Northwestern Europe , in particular as they are presented in Old Norse sources . Among male American Heathens there is a trend toward <unk> behavior , while a gendered division of labor – in which men are viewed as providers and women seen as being responsible for home and children – is also widespread among Heathens in the U.S. 
 Sociologist Jennifer Snook noted that as with all religions , Heathenry was " intimately connected " to politics , with practitioners ' political and religious beliefs influencing one another . As a result of the religion 's emphasis on honoring the land and its wights , many Heathens take an interest in ecological issues , with many considering their faith to be a nature religion . Heathen groups have participated in tree planting , raising money to purchase woodland , and campaigning against the construction of a railway between London and the Channel Tunnel in Southeastern England . Many Germanic Neopagans are also concerned with the preservation of heritage sites , and some practitioners have expressed concern regarding archaeological excavation of prehistoric and Early Medieval burials , believing that it is disrespectful to the individuals interned , whom Heathens widely see as their ancestors . 
 Ethical debates within the community also arise when some practitioners believe that the religious practices of certain co @-@ religionists conflict with the religion 's " conservative ideas of proper decorum " . For instance , while many Heathens eschew worship of the Norse god Loki , deeming him a baleful wight , his gender @-@ bending nature has made him attractive to many LGBT Heathens . Those who adopt the former perspective have thus criticized <unk> as effeminate and sexually deviant . Views on homosexuality and LGBT rights remain a source or tension within the community . Some right @-@ wing Heathen groups view homosexuality as being incompatible with a family @-@ oriented ethos and thus challenge same @-@ sex sexual activity . Other groups legitimize openness toward LGBT practitioners by reference to the gender @-@ bending actions of Thor and Odin in Norse mythology . There are , for instance , homosexual and transgender members of The Troth , a prominent U.S. Heathen organisation , while a group of self @-@ described " Homo @-@ Heathens " marched in the 2008 Stockholm Pride carrying a statue of the god Freyr , and many Scandinavian Heathen groups perform same @-@ sex marriages . 
 = = Rites and practices = = 
 In Anglophone countries , Heathen groups are typically called kindreds or hearths , or alternately sometimes as fellowships , tribes , or <unk> . These are small groups , often family units , and usually consist of between five and fifteen members . They are often bound together by oaths of loyalty , with strict screening procedures regulating the admittance of new members . Prospective members may undergo a probationary period before they are fully accepted and welcomed into the group , while other groups remain closed to all new members . Such groups are largely independent and autonomous , although typically network with other Heathen groups , particularly in their region . There are other followers of the religion who are not affiliated with such groups , operating as solitary practitioners , with these individuals often remaining in contact with other practitioners through social media . 
 Priests are often termed <unk> , while priestesses are <unk> , adopting Old Norse terms meaning " god @-@ man " and " god @-@ woman " respectively , with the plural term being <unk> . These individuals are rarely seen as intermediaries between practitioners and deities , instead having the role of facilitating and leading group ceremonies and being learned in the lore and traditions of the religion . Many kindreds believe that anyone can take on the position of priest , with members sharing organisational duties and taking turns in leading the rites . In other groups , it is considered necessary for the individual to gain formal credentials from an accredited Heathen organisation in order to be recognised as a priest . In a small number of groups – particularly those of the early 20th century which operated as secret societies – the priesthood is modelled on an initiatory system of ascending degrees akin to Freemasonry . 
 Heathen rites often take place in non @-@ public spaces , particularly in a practitioner 's home . In other cases , Heathen places of worship have been established on plots of land specifically purchased for the purpose ; these can represent either a <unk> , which is a sanctified place within nature like a grove of trees , or a hof , which is a wooden temple . The Heathen community has made various attempts to construct <unk> in different parts of the world . In 2014 , the <unk> Temple was opened in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , Iceland , while in 2015 British Odinists opened a temple in a converted 16th @-@ century chapel in Newark , Nottinghamshire . Heathens have also adopted archaeological sites as places of worship . For instance , British practitioners have assembled for rituals at the Nine Ladies stone circle in Derbyshire , and the <unk> Stones in Warwickshire while Swedish Heathens have done the same at Gamla Uppsala and Icelandic practitioners have met at Þingvellir . 
 Germanic Neopagan groups assemble for rituals in order to mark rites of passage , seasonal observances , oath takings , rites devoted to a specific deity , and for rites of need . These rites also serve as identity practices which mark the adherents out as Heathens . Strmiska noted that in Iceland , Ásatrú rituals had been deliberately constructed in an attempt to recreate or pay tribute to the ritual practices of pre @-@ Christian Icelanders , although also had space in which to innovate and change to suit the tastes and needs of contemporary practitioners . During religious ceremonies , many adherents choose to wear clothing that imitates the styles of dress worn in Iron Age and Early Medieval Northern Europe . They also often wear symbols indicating their religious allegiance . The most commonly used sign among Heathens is Mjölnir , or Thor 's hammer , which is worn as pendants , featured in Heathen art , and used as a gesture in ritual . It is sometimes used to express a particular affinity with the god Thor , although is also often used as a symbol of Heathenism as a whole , in particular representing the resilience and vitality of the religion . Another commonly used Heathen symbol is the <unk> , used to represent the god Odin or Woden . 
 = = = <unk> and sumbel = = = 
 The most important religious rite for Heathens is called blót , which constitutes a ritual in which offerings are provided to the gods . <unk> typically takes place outdoors , and usually consists of an offering of mead , which is contained within a bowl . The gods are invoked and requests expressed for their aid , as the priest uses a sprig or branch of an evergreen tree to sprinkle mead onto both statues of the deities and the assembled participants . This procedure might be scripted or largely improvised . Finally , the bowl of mead is poured onto a fire , or onto the earth , as a final libation to the gods . Sometimes , a communal meal is held afterward ; in some groups this is incorporated as part of the ritual itself . In other instances , the blót is simpler and less ritualized ; in this case , it can involve a practitioner setting some food aside , sometimes without words , for either gods or wights . Some Heathens perform such rituals on a daily basis , although for others it is a more occasional performance . Aside from honoring deities , communal blóts also serve as a form of group bonding . 
 In Iron Age and Early Medieval Northern Europe , blót referred to animal sacrifice performed to thank the deities and gain their favor . Such sacrifices have generally proved impractical for most modern practitioners , due to the fact that skills in animal slaughter are not widely taught , while the slaughter of animals is regulated by government in Western countries . However , in 2007 Strmiska noted that a " small but growing " number of Heathen practitioners in the U.S. had begun performing animal sacrifice as a part of blót . Those who do so typically follow the procedure outlined in the Heimskringla : the throat of the sacrificial animal is slashed with a sharp knife , and the blood is collected in a bowl before being sprinkled onto both participants of the rite and statues of the gods . Animals used for this purpose have included poultry as well as larger mammals like sheep and pigs , with the meat then being consumed by those attending the rite . Some practitioners have made alterations to this procedure : Strmiska noted two American Heathens who decided to use a rifle shot to the head to kill the animal swiftly , a decision made after they witnessed a blót in which the animal 's throat was cut incorrectly and it slowly died in agony ; they felt that such practices would have displeased the gods and accordingly brought harm upon those carrying out the sacrifice . 
 Another common ritual in Heathenry is sumbel , also spelled <unk> , a ritual drinking ceremony in which the gods are toasted . <unk> often takes place following a blót . In the U.S. , the sumbel commonly involves a drinking horn being filled with mead and passed among the assembled participants , who either drink from it directly , or pour some into their own drinking vessels to consume . During this process , toasts are made , as are verbal tributes to gods , heroes , and ancestors . Then , oaths and boasts ( promises of future actions ) might be made , both of which are considered binding on the speakers due to the sacred context of the sumbel ceremony . According to Snook , the sumbel has a strong social role , representing " a game of politicking , of socializing , cementing bonds of peace and friendship and forming new relationships " within the Heathen community . The ethnographer Murphy Pizza observed an example of a sumbel that took place in Minnesota in 2006 with the purpose of involving Heathen children ; rather than mead , the drinking horn contained apple juice , and the toasting accompanied the children taping pictures of apples to a poster of a tree that symbolized the apple tree of Iðunn from Norse mythology . 
 = = = <unk> and galdr = = = 
 One religious practice sometimes found in Heathenry is seiðr , which has been described as " a particular shamanic trance ritual complex " , although the appropriateness of using " shamanism " to describe seiðr is debatable . Contemporary seiðr developed during the 1990s out of the wider Neo @-@ Shamanic movement , with some practitioners studying the use of trance @-@ states in other faiths , such as <unk> , first . A prominent form is high @-@ seat or oracular seiðr , which is based on the account of <unk> in <unk> saga . Although such practices differ between groups , oracular seiðr typically involves a seiðr @-@ worker sitting on a high seat while songs and chants are performed to invoke gods and wights . Drumming is then performed to induce an altered state of consciousness in the practitioner , who goes on a meditative journey through <unk> to Hel . The assembled audience then provide questions for the seiðr @-@ worker , with the latter offering replies based on information obtained in their trance @-@ state . Some seiðr @-@ practitioners make use of entheogenic substances as part of this practice , although others explicitly oppose such usage . 
 Not all Heathens practice seiðr ; given its associations with both the ambiguity of sexuality and gender and the gods Odin and Loki in their unreliable trickster forms , many on the Heathen movement 's right @-@ wing disapprove of it . Although there are heterosexual male practitioners , seiðr is largely associated with women and gay men . One member of the Troth , Edred Thorsson , experimented with forms of seiðr which involved sex magic utilizing sado @-@ masochistic techniques , something which generated controversy in the community . Part of the discomfort some Heathens feel toward seiðr surrounds the lack of any criteria by which the community can determine whether the seiðr @-@ worker has genuinely received divine communication , and the fear that it will be used by some practitioners merely to bolster their own prestige . 
 <unk> is another Germanic Neopagan practice involving chanting or singing . As part of a galdr ceremony , runes or rune poems are also sometimes chanted , in order to create a communal mood and allow participants to enter into altered states of consciousness and request communication with deities . Some contemporary galdr chants and songs are influenced by Anglo @-@ Saxon folk magical charms , such as <unk> and the Nine Herbs Charm . These poems were originally written in a Christian context , although practitioners believe that they reflect themes present in pre @-@ Christian , shamanistic religion , and thus re @-@ appropriate and " <unk> " them for contemporary usage . 
 Some Heathens practice forms of divination using runes ; as part of this , items with runic markings on them might be pulled out of a bag or bundle , and read accordingly . In some cases , different runes are associated with different deities , one of the nine realms , or aspects of life . It is common for Heathens to utilize the Common Germanic Futhark as a runic alphabet , although some practitioners instead adopt the Anglo @-@ Saxon <unk> or the Younger Futhark . The contemporary use of runes for divinatory purposes is however found more widely than within Heathenry , with books on the subject being common in New Age bookstores . Due to the fact that it was not a factor of common Iron Age and Early Medieval European rituals , magic is not an intrinsic part of Heathenry , although various magical practices are performed by some practitioners . 
 = = = Festivals = = = 
 Different Germanic Neopagan groups celebrate different festivals according to their cultural and religious focus . The most widely observed Heathen festivals are Winter Nights , Yule , and <unk> , all of which were listed in his Heimskringla and are thus of ancient origin . The first of these marks the start of winter in Northern Europe , while the second marks Midwinter , and the last marks the beginning of summer . Additional festivals are also marked by Heathen practice throughout the year . These often include days which commemorate individuals who fought against the Christianization of Northern Europe , or who led armies and settlers into new lands . Some Heathen groups hold festivals dedicated to a specific deity . 
 Some Heathens celebrate the eight festivals found in the Wheel of the Year , a tradition that they share with many contemporary Pagans . Others celebrate only six of these festivals , as represented by a six @-@ spoked Wheel of the Year . The use of such festivals is criticized by other practitioners , who highlight that this system is of modern , mid @-@ 20th century origin and does not link with the original religious celebrations of the pre @-@ Christian Germanic world . 
 Such festivals can be held on the same day each year , although they are often celebrated by Heathen communities on the nearest available weekend , so that those practitioners who work during the week can attend . During these ceremonies , Heathens often recite poetry to honor the deities , which typically draw upon or imitate the Early Medieval poems written in Old Norse or Old English . Mead or ale is also typically drunk , with offerings being given to deities , while fires , torches , or candles are often lit . There are also regional meetings of Heathens known as Things . At these , religious rites are performed , while workshops , stalls , feasts , and competitive games are also present . In the U.S. , there are two national gatherings , Althing and <unk> . 
 = = Racial issues = = 
 The question of race represents a major source of division among Heathens , particularly in the United States . Within the Heathen community , one viewpoint holds that race is entirely a matter of biological heredity , while the opposing position is that race is a social construct rooted in cultural heritage . In U.S. Heathen discourse , these viewpoints are described as the universalist and the folkish positions , respectively . These two factions – which Kaplan termed the " racialist " and " <unk> " camps – often clash , with Kaplan claiming that a " virtual civil war " existed between them within the American Heathen community . The universalist and folkish division has also spread to other countries , however in contrast to North America and much of Northern Europe , discussions of race rarely arise among the Icelandic Heathen community as a result of the nation @-@ state 's predominantly ethnically homogeneous composition . 
 Contrasting with this binary division , Gardell categorizes Heathenry in the United States into three groups according to their stance on the issue of race : the " anti @-@ racist " group who denounce any association between the religion and racial identity , the " radical racist " faction who see it as the natural religion of the ' Aryan race ' which cannot rightly be followed by members of any other racial groups , and the " ethnic " faction who seek a middle @-@ path by acknowledging the religion 's roots in Northern Europe and its connection with those of Northern European heritage . Religious studies scholar Egil <unk> deemed Gardell 's threefold typology to be " indispensable to make sense of the diverging positions within the broader discourse " of Heathenry . The religious studies scholar Stefanie von Schnurbein also adopted this tripartite division , although referred to the groups as the " racial @-@ religious " , " a @-@ racist " , and " <unk> " faction respectively . 
 Exponents of the universalist , anti @-@ racist approach believe that the deities of Northern Europe can call anyone to their worship , regardless of ethnic background . This group rejects the folkish emphasis on race , believing that even if unintended , it can lead to the adoption of racist attitudes toward those of non @-@ Northern European heritage . Anti @-@ racist practitioners such as Stephan Grundy have emphasized the fact that ancient Northern Europeans were known to marry and have children with members of other ethnic groups , and that in Norse mythology the Æsir also did the same with Vanir , <unk> , and humans , thus using such points to critique the racialist view . <unk> welcome practitioners of Heathenry who are not of Northern European ancestry ; for instance , there are Jewish and African American members of the U.S.-based Troth , while many of its white members are in biracial marriages . While sometimes retaining the idea of Heathenry as an indigenous religion , proponents of this view have sometimes argued that Heathenry is indigenous to the land of Northern Europe , rather than any race . 
 The folkish sector of the movement deems Heathenry to be the indigenous religion of a biologically distinct Nordic race . Some practitioners explain this by asserting that the religion is intrinsically connected to the collective unconscious of this race , with prominent American Asatruer Stephen McNallen developing this into a concept that he termed " <unk> " . McNallen and many others in the " ethnic " faction of Heathenry explicitly deny that they are racist , although Gardell noted that their views would be deemed racist under certain definitions of the word . Gardell considered many " ethnic " Heathens to be ethnic nationalists , and many folkish practitioners express disapproval of multiculturalism and the mixture of different races in modern Europe , advocating a position of racial separatism . In this group 's discourse , there is much talk of " ancestors " and " homelands " , although these concepts may be very vaguely defined . Those adopting the " ethnic " folkish position have been criticized by both anti @-@ racist and radical racist factions , the former deeming " ethnic " Heathenry to be a front for racism and the latter deeming its adherents to be race traitors for their failure to fully embrace the white supremacist cause . 
 Some folkish Heathens are white supremacists and explicit racists , representing a " radical racist " faction that favours the terms " Odinism " and " Wotanism " . Kaplan stated that the " borderline separating racialist Odinism and National Socialism is exceedingly thin " , adding that this racialist wing inhabited " the most distant reaches " of the modern Pagan movement . Practitioners in this sector of the religion have paid tribute to Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany , and claimed that the white race is facing extinction at the hands of a Jewish world conspiracy . Many in the inner circle of The Order , a white supremacist militant group active in the U.S. during the 1980s , were Odinists , and various racist Heathens have espoused the Fourteen Words slogan developed by the Heathen and Order member David Lane . A number of racist organisations , such as the Order of Nine Angles and the Black Order , combine elements of Heathenism with Satanism , although other racist Heathens , such as Wotansvolk 's Ron <unk> , have denounced the integration of these differing religious traditions . Racist Heathens are heavily critical of their anti @-@ racist counterparts , often declaring that the latter have been misled by the New Age movement and political correctness . Snook stated that both mainstream media and early academic studies of American Heathenry had focused primarily on the racist elements within the movement , thus neglecting their anti @-@ racist counterparts .

 = = = Romanticist and Völkisch predecessors = = = 
 During the late 18th and 19th centuries , German Romanticism generated increased attention to the pre @-@ Christian belief systems of Germanic Europe , with various Romanticist intellectuals expressing the opinion that these ancient religions were " more natural , organic and positive " than Christianity . Such an attitude was promoted by the scholarship of Romanticist intellectuals like Johann Gottfried Herder , Jacob Grimm , and Wilhelm Grimm . This development went in tandem with a growth in nationalism and the idea of the volk , contributing to the establishment of the Völkisch movement in German @-@ speaking Europe . Criticising the Jewish roots of Christianity , in 1900 the Germanist Ernst <unk> published a pamphlet calling for the revival of a racialized ancient German religion . Other writers supported his claims , resulting in the formation of both the Bund fur <unk> and the Deutscher Orden in 1911 and then the <unk> @-@ deutsche Religions @-@ Gemeinschaft in 1912 . 
 Another development of Heathenry emerged within the occult völkisch movement known as Ariosophy . One of these völkisch <unk> was the Austrian occultist Guido von List , who established a religion that he termed " Wotanism " , with an inner core that he referred to as " Armanism " . List 's Wotanism was based heavily on the Eddas , although over time it came to be increasingly influenced by the occult teachings of the Theosophical Society . List 's ideas would be transmitted in Germany by a number of prominent right @-@ wingers , and adherents to his ideas were among the founders of the Reichshammerbund in Leipzig in 1912 , and included individuals who held key positions in the Germanenorden . The Thule Society founded by Rudolf von <unk> developed from the Germanenorden , and displayed a Theosophical influenced interpretation of Norse mythology . 
 In 1933 , the eclectic German Faith Movement ( Deutsche <unk> ) was founded by the religious studies scholar Jakob Wilhelm Hauer , who wanted to unite the disparate older Heathen groups . Although active throughout the Nazi era , his hopes that his " German Faith " would be declared the official faith of Nazi Germany were thwarted . Although the Heathen movement probably never had more than a few thousand followers during its 1920s heyday , it held the allegiance of many middle @-@ class intellectuals , including journalists , artists , illustrators , scholars , and teachers , and thus exhibited a wider influence on society . 
 The völkisch occultists – among them Pagans like List and Christians like Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels – " contributed importantly to the mood of the Nazi era " . Few however had a direct influence on the Nazi Party leadership , although the prominent exception was Karl Maria <unk> , who was a friend and key influence on the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) leader Heinrich Himmler . <unk> professed ancestral @-@ clairvoyant memories of ancient German society , proclaiming that Wotanism was in conflict with another ancient religion , <unk> , which was devoted to a messianic Germanic figure known as Krist , who was later wrongly transformed into the figure of Jesus . However , many Heathen groups actually disbanded during the Nazi period , and were only able to re @-@ establish themselves after World War II , in West Germany , where freedom of religion had been re @-@ established . After the defeat of Nazi Germany , there was a social stigma surrounding völkisch ideas and groups , along with a common perception that the mythologies of the pre @-@ Christian Germanic societies had been tainted through their usage by the Nazi administration , an attitude that to some extent persisted into the 21st century . 
 The völkisch movement also emerged in 1930s Norway with the milieu surrounding such groups as the Ragnarok Circle and Hans S. Jacobsen 's <unk> Ragnarok journal ; prominent figures involved in this milieu were the writer Per <unk> and composer <unk> <unk> , although it left no successors in post @-@ war Norway . A variant of " Odinism " was developed by the Australian Alexander Rud Mills , who published The Odinist Religion ( 1930 ) and established the Anglican Church of Odin . Politically racialist , Mills viewed Odinism as a religion for what he considered to be the " British race " and deemed it to be in a cosmic battle with Judeo @-@ Christian religion . Having formulated " his own unique blend " of Ariosophy , Mills was heavily influenced by von List 's writings . Some of Heathenry 's roots have been traced to the " back to nature " movement of the early 20th @-@ century , among them the <unk> Kift and the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry . 
 = = = Modern development = = = 
 In the early 1970s , Heathen organisations emerged in the United Kingdom , United States , Canada , Australia , and in Iceland , largely independently of each other . This has been partly attributed to the wider growth of the modern Pagan movement in the 1960s and 1970s , as well as the development of the New Age movement , which encouraged the establishment of new religious movements intent on reviving pre @-@ Christian religions . The 1990s and 2000s then saw the emergence of a range of new Heathen groups , many of which distanced themselves from overtly political agendas and placed a stronger emphasis on historical authenticity . 
 Heathenry emerged in the United States during the 1960s . In 1969 the Danish Odinist Else Christensen established the Odinist Fellowship from her home in Florida , U.S. Heavily influenced by Mills ' writings , she began publication of a magazine , The Odinist , although this focused to a greater extent on right @-@ wing and racialist ideas than theological ones . Stephen McNallen first founded the Viking Brotherhood in the early 1970s , before creating the Asatru Free Assembly in 1976 , which broke up in 1986 amid widespread political disagreements after McNallen 's repudiation of neo @-@ Nazis within the group . In the 1990s , McNallen founded the Asatru Folk Assembly ( AFA ) , an ethnically @-@ oriented Heathen group headquartered in California . Meanwhile , <unk> Murray and his kindred in Arizona founded the Ásatrú Alliance ( AA ) in the late 1980s , which shared the AFA 's perspectives on race and which published the Vor Tru newsletter . In 1987 , Stephen Flowers and James Chisholm founded The Troth , which was incorporated in Texas . Taking an inclusive , non @-@ racialist view , it soon grew into an international organisation . 
 In Iceland , the influence of pre @-@ Christian belief systems still pervaded the country 's cultural heritage into the 20th century . There , farmer <unk> <unk> founded the Heathen group Ásatrúarfélagið in 1972 , which initially had 12 members . <unk> served as <unk> ( chief priest ) until his death in 1993 , when he was succeeded by <unk> Ingi Hansen . As the group expanded in size , Hansen 's leadership caused schisms , and to retain the unity of the movement , he stepped down and was replaced by Hilmar <unk> <unk> in 2003 , by which time Ásatrúarfélagið had accumulated 777 members and played a visible role in Icelandic society . In England , the British Committee for the Restoration of the Odinic Rite was established by John <unk> in 1972 . In 1992 , Mark Mirabello published Odin Brotherhood , which claimed the existence of a secret society of Odinists ; most British Heathens doubt its existence . 
 In Sweden , the first Heathen groups developed in the 1970s ; early examples included the Breidablikk @-@ <unk> ( Guild of Breidablikk ) founded in 1975 and the <unk> <unk> founded in 1987 , the latter of which diverged from the former by emphasising a non @-@ racialist interpretation of the religion . In 1994 , the Sveriges <unk> ( Swedish Asatru Assembly ) was founded , growing to become the largest Heathen organisation in the country . The first Norwegian Heathen group , Blindern <unk> , was established as a student group at the University of Oslo in the mid @-@ 1980s , while the larger <unk> Bifrost was established in 1996 ; after a schism in that group , the Foreningen Forn Sed was formed in 1999 . In Denmark , a small group was founded near to Copenhagen in 1986 , although as a wider movement Heathenry would not be established until the 1990s , when a group calling itself Forn <unk> developed . In Germany , various groups established that explicitly rejected their religion 's völkisch and right @-@ wing past , most notably <unk> ( Raven 's Clan ) in 1994 and <unk> <unk> ( Kin of the Norns ) in 2005 . Several foreign Heathen organisations also established a presence in the German Heathen scene ; in 1994 the Odinic Rite Deutschland ( Odinic Rite Germany ) was established , although it later declared its independence and became the Verein für <unk> <unk> <unk> ( Society for Germanic Paganism ) , while the Troth also established a German group as <unk> , which declared its independence in 2000 . 
 Heathen influences were apparent in forms of black metal from the 1990s , where lyrics and themes often expressed a longing for a pre @-@ Christian Northern past ; the mass media , however , typically associated such a genre with Satanism . From the mid @-@ 1990s , the internet greatly aided the propagation of Heathenry in various parts of the world . That decade also saw the strong growth of racist Heathenry among those incarcerated within the U.S. prison system as a result of outreach programs established by various Heathen groups . In this period , many Heathen groups also came to interact increasingly with other ethnic @-@ oriented Pagan groups in Eastern Europe , such as Lithuanian <unk> , and many joined the World Congress of Ethnic Religions on its formation in 1998 . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 Adherents of Heathenry can be found in Europe , North America , and Australasia . In 2007 , the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated that it was impossible to develop a precise figure for the number of Heathens across the world , however a self @-@ selected census conducted in 2013 found 16 @,@ 700 members in 98 countries , the bulk of whom lived in the United States . In 2016 , Schnurbein stated that there were probably no more than 20 @,@ 000 Heathens globally . She noted that , while there were some exceptions , most Heathen groups were between 60 @-@ 70 % male in their composition . 
 Many individuals are inspired to join the movement after enjoying German folk tales or Norse myths as children , or after being interested by the depiction of Norse religion in popular culture . Some others claim to have involved themselves in the religion after experiencing direct revelation through dreams , which they interpret as having been provided by the gods . As with other religions , a sensation of " coming home " has also been reported by many Heathens who have converted to the faith . Although practitioners typically live within Christian majority societies , they often express the view that Christianity has little to offer them . During her research , Schnurbein found that during the 1980s many Heathens had been motivated to join the religion in part by their own anti @-@ Christian ethos , but that this attitude had become less prominent among the Heathen community as the significance of the Christian churches had declined in Western nations after that point . Many Heathens are also involved in historical reenactment , focusing on the early medieval societies of Germanic Europe , although others are critical of this practice , believing that it blurs the boundary between life and fantasy . 
 = = = North America = = = 
 Although deeming it impossible to calculate the exact size of the Heathen community in the US , sociologist Jeffrey Kaplan estimated that , in the mid @-@ 1990s , there were around 500 active practitioners in the country , with a further thousand individuals on the periphery of the movement . He noted that the overwhelming majority of individuals in the movement were white , male , and young . Most had at least an undergraduate degree , and worked in a mix of white collar and blue collar jobs . The Pagan Census project led by Helen A. Berger , Evan A. Leach , and Leigh S. Shaffer gained 60 responses from Heathens in the U.S. , noting that 65 % were male and 35 % female , which they saw as the " opposite " of the rest of the country 's Pagan community . The majority had a college education , but were generally less well educated than the wider Pagan community , with a lower median income than the wider Pagan community too . From her experience within the community , Snook concurred that the majority of American Heathens were male , adding that most were white and middle @-@ aged , but believed that there had been a growth in the proportion of female Heathens in the U.S. since the mid @-@ 1990s . Subsequent assessments have suggested a larger support base ; 10 @,@ 000 to 20 @,@ 000 according to McNallen in 2006 , and 7 @,@ 878 according to the 2014 census . 
 = = = Europe = = = 
 In the United Kingdom Census 2001 , 300 people registered as Heathen in England and Wales . However , many Heathens followed the advice of the Pagan Federation ( PF ) and simply described themselves as " Pagan " , while other Heathens did not specify their religious beliefs . In the 2011 census , 1 @,@ 958 people self @-@ identified as Heathen in England and Wales . 
 By 2003 , the Icelandic Heathen organisation Ásatrúarfélagið had 777 members , and by 2015 , it reported 2 @,@ 400 members . In Iceland , Heathenry has an impact larger than the number of its adherents . Based on his experience researching Danish Heathens , Amster stated that while it was possible to obtain membership figures of Heathen organisations , it was " impossible to estimate " the number of unaffiliated solo practitioners . Conversely , in 2015 , Gregorius estimated that there were at most a thousand Heathens in Sweden – both affiliated and unaffiliated – although noted that practitioners themselves often perceived their numbers as being several times higher than this . Although noting that there were no clear figures available for the gender balance within the community , he cited practitioners who claim that there are a greater number of men active within Swedish Heathen organisations . Schnurbein observed that most Heathens in Scandinavia were middle @-@ class professionals aged between thirty and sixty .

 = Joseph Webb House = 
 The Joseph Webb House is a historic Georgian @-@ style house at 211 Main Street in Wethersfield , Connecticut . It was designated a National Historic Landmark for its significance as the location of the General George Washington / Rochambeau ( French commander ) five @-@ day military conference held in 1781 during the American Revolutionary War that preceded the Siege of Yorktown , the last major battle of the war in North America . Washington , in his words , " lodged ... at the house of Joseph Webb " , on the May 17 , 1781 . Located in Old Wethersfield , the Joseph Webb House is owned by the Webb @-@ Deane @-@ Stevens Museum and serves as its headquarters . The interior has been restored to an 18th @-@ century appearance and the grounds feature a Colonial Revival garden and 19th @-@ century barn in back . 
 Originally built in 1752 for Joseph Webb , the house remained in the family until around 1820 when it was sold to Martin Welles . It remained in the Welles family until 1913 when it was purchased by a group of businessmen who intended to use it as an athenaeum or a library , but a lack of funds saw its resale to Wallace Nutting . The house opened in 1916 as a part of Nutting 's " Chain of Colonial Picture Houses " . Nutting sold the house to the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in 1919 , who continue to operate it as a historic house museum . In 1996 and later in 2007 , Nutting 's murals and interpretive Colonial Revival elements were acknowledged and integrated with an exhibit showing his influence .

 Framed by Judah Wright in 1752 for Joseph Webb , the three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half story house was designed with a large gambrel roof that provides extra storage space . Webb was a successful merchant who had ships trading in the West Indies and ran a local store ; he married Mehitabel Nott and had six children before his death at the age of 34 . The executor of the estate was Silas Deane who assisted Mrs. Webb financially and emotionally . Deane later married Mrs. Webb and built a house next door . The eldest child , Joseph Webb Jr . , then 12 at the time of his father 's death , inherited the house . 
 In 1774 , Joseph Webb Jr . , also a successful merchant , married Abigail Chester and the couple remained in the house ; they became well @-@ known hosts and their house was nicknamed " Hospitality Hall " . The house 's fame stems from George Washington five night stay in the house , where he planned the Siege of Yorktown that led to American Independence with French general Comte de Rochambeau . Smithsonian magazine writer Howard Hugh suggests that the red wool flock wallpaper in the bedchamber where Washington slept was hung in anticipation of the general 's arrival . 
 Webb Jr. sold the house in 1790 and it passed through different owners until it was purchased by Judge Martin Welles around 1820 . Welles went on to modernize the southern half of the property . The house remained in the Welles family until the death of Welles ' grandson in 1913 . The house was purchased by a group of businessmen who sought to operate it as athenaeum or a library ; however a lack of funds resulted in its sale to Wallace Nutting in 1916 . 
 = = Wallace Nutting = = 
 The Joseph Webb House was bought by antiquarian Wallace Nutting on February 9 , 1916 to serve as a sales area and studio . Lyle writes that Nutting intended to use the house " as one of the links in his “ Chain of Colonial Picture Houses ” — all important historic sites located in New England that were part of his business plan to promote a nostalgic appreciation of “ Old America . ” " Nutting commissioned painted murals for the front parlors and hallway . 
 On July 4 , 1916 , the Webb house was opened to the public with a 25 cent admission charge , but the American entry into World War I and the rationing of gasoline took its toll on Nutting 's business . Nutting sold the house in 1919 to The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in Connecticut , which opened it to the public as a historic house museum . 
 = = Colonial Dames = = 
 The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America restored the house to before Nutting 's changes with a team of preservationists ; with the intention of restoring the appearance of the original construction . 
 The murals commissioned by Nutting were covered up with reproduction wallpapers , but a panel of the wall paper was torn off and the hallway murals were painted over . In 1996 , the Dames acknowledged Wallace Nutting 's interpretive focus of the Webb House and removed the wallpaper in the " Yorktown " parlor . In 2007 , the murals in the northeast parlor were uncovered and reinterpretation of the room around the Colonial Revival period . An exhibit in the center hall of the house shows Wallace Nutting 's influence . 
 The Webb @-@ Deane @-@ Stevens Museum gives tours of the house April through November , but requires appointments for tours for January through March . The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961 . It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15 , 1966 . 
 = Collaborations ( Ravi Shankar and George Harrison album ) = 
 Collaborations is a four @-@ disc compilation box set by Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar and former Beatle George Harrison . Released in October 2010 on Dark Horse Records , it compiles two studio albums originally issued on that label – the long @-@ unavailable Shankar Family & Friends ( 1974 ) and Ravi Shankar 's Music Festival from India ( 1976 ) – and Chants of India , first issued on Angel Records in 1997 . Although all three albums were originally Shankar releases , for which Harrison served in the role of music producer and guest musician , both Shankar and Harrison are credited as artists on the box set . Each of the collaborative projects represents a departure from Shankar 's more typical work as a sitarist and performer of Hindustani classical ragas , with the box set showcasing his forays into , variously , jazz and rock , Indian folk and orchestral ensembles , and devotional music . 
 The fourth disc of Collaborations is a DVD containing previously unissued film of a performance by the Music Festival from India , recorded at London 's Royal Albert Hall in September 1974 . Filmed by director Stuart Cooper , the footage required substantial restoration for its 2010 release . An audio @-@ only track on the DVD , prepared by Anoushka Shankar and Paul Hicks , provides a more complete record of the concert . 
 Issued nine years after Harrison 's death , the limited @-@ edition release coincided with celebrations for Shankar 's 90th birthday and was overseen by Harrison 's widow , Olivia . Among the lavish packaging for the compilation , each disc appears inside enlarged , 8 ½ -inch sleeves , and each copy of the set is individually numbered . An accompanying book contains a foreword by American composer Philip Glass , rare photographs documenting Shankar and Harrison 's 35 @-@ year friendship , and commentary from both artists on the projects featured in the box set . While Collaborations presents only a portion of Shankar and Harrison 's work together , music critics have recognised it as a successful representation of the far @-@ reaching cultural legacy of their partnership . 
 = = Background = = 
 In June 1966 , while still a member of the Beatles , George Harrison met Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar in London and became a student of the sitarist . Harrison later said that , for himself , the music was " like an excuse " , and that in reality he was searching for a " spiritual connection " with the culture of India . The association immediately brought Shankar and Indian music unprecedented popularity in the West , while Harrison 's introduction of the sitar into the Beatles ' sound inspired a new genre known as raga rock . By 1971 , a year after the Beatles ' break @-@ up , and having established himself as a solo artist with his All Things Must Pass triple album ( 1970 ) , Harrison began working with Shankar , as his producer . These 1971 projects , all released on the Beatles ' Apple record label , included the soundtrack to the documentary film Raga ; Shankar 's Joi Bangla EP , recorded to raise international awareness for the plight of refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War ; and the live album The Concert for Bangladesh , which documented the UNICEF benefit concerts that Harrison and Shankar staged in New York that August . 
 Twenty @-@ three years older than Harrison , Shankar described their relationship as , variously , that of father and son ( with each one adopting either role ) ; close friends ; and teacher and student . Author Ian Inglis has commented on the various differences between the two musicians , in terms of age , culture and social status : " And yet , in another sense , those contrasting factors helped to prevent any personal or professional rivalries , produced spaces and separations that their music could fill , and ultimately created … a partnership that was never competitive , but perfectly complementary . " While their collaborations continued only intermittently after the mid 1970s , the depth of their friendship remained , such that Harrison would credit Shankar as being " the person who has influenced my life the most " . When Harrison died in November 2001 , following a four @-@ year battle with cancer , Shankar was at his bedside , along with members of Harrison 's family . 
 = = Musical content = = 
 The 2010 box set Collaborations was one of several reissue projects celebrating Shankar 's 90th birthday . It compiles three studio albums that he and Harrison worked on together between 1973 and 1996 : Shankar Family & Friends ( 1974 ) , Ravi Shankar 's Music Festival from India ( 1976 ) and Chants of India ( 1997 ) . The first two of these albums had long been out of print , and their inclusion in the box set marked the debut CD release for both titles . Disc four contains a previously unissued concert film from 1974 , titled Music Festival from India – Live at the Royal Albert Hall . 
 Harrison 's role on the three studio albums was mainly confined to that of a record producer , although his name appeared prominently on the front cover of Chants of India , and the latter was marketed as a collaborative work between Shankar and Harrison . Collaborations presents the albums in reverse chronological order , with Chants of India appearing on disc one . 
 = = = Chants of India = = = 
 Shankar and Harrison recorded the album between January and August 1996 , with sessions taking place in the southern India city of Madras , and at Harrison 's English home , Friar Park , in Henley @-@ on @-@ Thames . The majority of the selections consist of Vedic prayers and other Sanskrit @-@ worded , Hindu religious texts that Shankar set to music . He also wrote new pieces in a similarly sacred vein , including " <unk> " , the only song on the album to contain Hindi lyrics . Among the many musicians and singers on Chants of India were Shankar 's daughter Anoushka , tablist Bikram Ghosh and santoor player Tarun Bhattacharya . 
 The album 's creation resulted from Shankar and Harrison having renewed their close friendship in recent years ; this following a period when , by his own admission , Shankar had partially withdrawal from his Western @-@ musician friends in the late 1970s , stung by persistent criticism from the Indian press that he was " diluting " Indian classical music . Other projects that the pair undertook together in the mid 1990s include Ravi Shankar : In Celebration ( 1996 ) , a four @-@ disc career retrospective compiled by Harrison , and Raga Mala , Shankar 's second autobiography , for which Harrison served as editor . 
 Shankar considered Chants of India to be among his best works , and he praised Harrison 's contributions as a musician and producer on the album . Released on Angel Records in May 1997 , the album was critically well received . In his book The Dawn of Indian Music in the West , Peter Lavezzoli describes it as " a quiet masterpiece , one of the most uplifting and musically engaging recordings of scared music " , while AllMusic critic Jim <unk> writes : " Among records of this nature , this one is special . " Chants of India was the last official musical collaboration between the two artists , after Harrison was diagnosed with cancer in August that year . 
 = = = Ravi Shankar 's Music Festival from India = = = 
 Harrison first got the idea to stage what became the 1974 Music Festival from India during the Bombay sessions for his debut solo album , the 1968 film soundtrack Wonderwall Music , after hearing Shankar 's orchestral work Nava Rasa Ranga . While in India in early 1974 , Shankar and Harrison planned the venture , which consisted of a European tour by Shankar 's hand @-@ picked orchestra of Indian classical musicians , after which the ensemble would tour North America with Harrison and his band of Western musicians . For his orchestra , Shankar selected regular accompanists such as tabla player Alla Rakha and singers Lakshmi Shankar and Kamala Chakravarty ; other established players including Shivkumar Sharma ( santoor ) , Hariprasad Chaurasia ( flute ) , Rijram Desad ( percussion ) and <unk> Maitra ( tabla tarang ) ; and musicians that went on to establish themselves internationally as a result of their participation , such as violinist L. Subramaniam and sarangi player Sultan Khan . 
 Before the European tour began in September 1974 , Shankar and Harrison recorded a studio album with the sixteen Music Festival musicians at Friar Park . Using the facilities from his upstairs studio , FPSHOT , Harrison recorded the album in Friar Park 's drawing room , overlooking the property 's expansive gardens . Shankar wrote the pieces in a variety of traditional Indian folk and classical styles , often composing on his way to Henley from his London hotel , while travelling along the M4 motorway . Harrison later recalled his fear that Shankar 's directions to the assembled musicians would create a musical " catastrophe " , yet the result each time was " the most amazing thing " . Among the tracks on Ravi Shankar 's Music Festival from India , " Raga Jait " is Shankar 's interpretation of that raga for an orchestral ensemble , and the ten @-@ minute " <unk> " features extended interplay between the various percussionists . The album was released on Harrison 's Dark Horse record label in February 1976 . 
 = = = Shankar Family & Friends = = = 
 Shankar and Harrison began recording Shankar Family & Friends in Los Angeles in April 1973 . In a marked departure from Shankar 's more familiar work in the Hindustani classical style , the album was a fusion of several musical genres , particularly Indian classical , jazz and Western pop . The contributors ranged from American jazz proponents Tom Scott and Emil Richards to Indian players such as Rakha , Sharma , Chaurasia , Subramaniam , sarodya Aashish Khan and , a former student and longtime associate of Shankar 's , multi @-@ instrumentalist Harihar Rao . Adopting the pseudonym " Hari Georgeson " , since he was still contracted to EMI @-@ affiliated Apple Records , Harrison contributed on electric and acoustic guitars , and autoharp . Shankar played sitar , surbahar and Moog synthesizer , and otherwise served as director and conductor at the sessions . Other participants included guitarist David Bromberg , members of the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra , and electronic music artists Paul Beaver and Robert <unk> . 
 One side of the original LP consisted of music that Shankar had composed for a ballet , titled Dream , Nightmare & Dawn , while among the album 's other songs and bhajans was a rare English @-@ language pop composition by Shankar , " I Am Missing You " . Harrison arranged the latter track in a rock @-@ music setting , with backing from Western musicians such as Scott , Billy Preston , Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner ; sung by Lakshmi Shankar , this version of " I Am Missing You " was the first single released on Dark Horse Records , in September 1974 . Music from Shankar Family & Friends featured in the setlist for the Harrison – Shankar North American tour later that year , during which the Music Festival personnel were accompanied on stage by Harrison and members of his touring band , such as Scott and Richards .

 Harrison sponsored Shankar 's Music Festival from India concerts through his Material World Charitable Foundation , for which the European tour was its debut event . The DVD issued on Collaborations is from the Music Festival 's concert at the Royal Albert Hall , London , on 23 September 1974 , the first date of the tour . The footage was shot by director Stuart Cooper , whose film Little Malcolm , made early the previous year , marked Harrison 's first foray into film production . 
 After Harrison introduces Shankar to the London audience , Shankar conducts the musicians during the performance . He plays sitar on the twenty @-@ minute " Raga Yaman Kalyan " , however , accompanied by Rakha . Author Simon Leng recognises the Music Festival from India as the first Indian orchestra to have played in Europe , while Harrison 's widow Olivia , in her role as producer of the compilation , notes singer and <unk> player T.V. <unk> among the musicians who went on to have " incredible careers of their own " . 
 Considerable restoration was required to prepare Live at the Royal Albert Hall for release in 2010 , since much of Cooper 's footage had been lost during the ensuing decades or damaged . Olivia Harrison explained : " We laid music where we had picture and we cheated a little bit with picture where only sound existed to create over an hour of the concert … " A separate selection on the DVD presents the audio for a more complete version of the performance , lasting over 90 minutes . Also included is a short segment where Anoushka Shankar and Paul Hicks , as remaster producers , work on the concert audio in a San Diego studio and are visited by Shankar and Olivia .

 Collaborations was presented in an unusually lavish package , designed by Drew Lorimer and Olivia Harrison . Housed in a hinged box , the four discs sit on cardboard bases inside album covers measuring 8 ½ by 8 ½ inches , with the enlargement from CD and DVD dimensions allowing for a closer replication of the original LP jackets . A limited @-@ edition release , each copy of the box set came with an individually numbered certificate of authenticity . 
 A 56 @-@ page , hardcover book contains quotes from Shankar and Harrison , commenting on their long friendship and the projects represented on the discs . Both artists ' families supplied photographs for the book , while other pictures are credited to professional photographers Clive Arrowsmith , <unk> Hoffmann , Jan Steward and Carolyn Jones . The photo used on the front of the box was one of a series of pictures that Arrowsmith took at Friar Park in 1974 , over the period when the Music Festival orchestra were recording and rehearsing there . 
 The book 's foreword was supplied by American composer Philip Glass , with whom Shankar had collaborated on the 1990 album Passages . Glass writes of the Shankar – Harrison musical partnership as having " [ made ] waves ... on a tremendous scale and for a passionate worldwide audience " , adding that its influence " reverberates , as clearly , even today " .

 The box set was issued on Dark Horse Records , distributed by Rhino Entertainment , on 18 October 2010 in Britain , and 19 October in the United States . Announcing the release in August that year , Consequence of Sound described it as " a certified dream for world music / Beatles fans " . Collaborations coincided with East Meets West Music 's Shankar reissues such as the Nine Decades series and the DVD release of the long @-@ unavailable Raga , which features 1968 footage of Harrison as well as the soundtrack he produced and originally issued on Apple . In America , the box set was available solely through Harrison 's official website and the online retailer Amazon . At this time the Harrison estate undertook a similarly low @-@ key campaign for the 40th anniversary of All Things Must Pass , which coincided with several reissue projects relating to the Beatles . 
 Collaborations entered Billboard magazine 's Top World Albums list at number 3 , its peak position on that chart . Having been Harrison 's assistant at Dark Horse during the 1970s , Olivia Harrison promoted the release ; in an interview with Spinner , she described the reissue project as a " labor of love for me " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In a five @-@ star review for Goldmine magazine , Gillian Gaar considered that Collaborations " succeeded on crossover appeal " and had praise for the " mesmerizing " Music Festival album and concert DVD . Reviewing the box set for Uncut , John Lewis found Harrison " a little too respectful " in his deference to Shankar on the 1970s projects , although he admired Chants of India , saying : " there is a heaviness and intensity to each performance that makes this seemingly austere collection quite compelling to rock ears . " 
 Terry Staunton of Record Collector commented that had John Lennon and Paul McCartney ceded more of their creative control in the Beatles to Harrison , " there might today be a stronger case for Ravi Shankar 's claim to the fiercely @-@ debated position of fifth Beatle . " Staunton described Collaborations as an " intriguing series of East – West summits " and concluded : " It may have limited appeal … but this box set is a strong testament to two friends ' mutual respect and their desire to push musical boundaries . " In an article for Time Out New York on the various Beatles @-@ related reissues of late 2010 , Sophie Harris wrote : " You might not think that Vedic chanting is your thing , but as Philip Glass notes in the introduction to this gorgeous set , there 's scarcely a musician in the world who hasn 't been touched by the musical partnership [ between Shankar and Harrison ] … Contained herein : awesome , spooky @-@ sounding chanting , a live DVD , a glossy book and much more to rejoice about . " 
 While also comparing the collection to the more highly publicised reissues by Lennon and McCartney , Joe Marchese of The Second Disc praised Collaborations for its adventurous music , as well as the lavishness of the packaging . Of the three studio albums , he described Shankar Family & Friends as the " most commercial " and Music Festival from India as " exotic , but immediately transporting " , and wrote that " joy and a celebratory feel exudes from [ Chants of India ] " . Marchese added : " [ The ] albums illuminate an important aspect of the career of George Harrison , for sure . But they also remind one of the immense musical influence of Ravi Shankar ... These once hard @-@ to @-@ find LPs are presented with great integrity here . " 
 Writing for AllMusic , Richie Unterberger qualifies the joint credit afforded Shankar and Harrison , saying : " Without downplaying the closeness of the two musicians ' friendship and Harrison 's genuine participation in all of these projects , it should be stated up front that this is much more Shankar 's music than Harrison 's , and much more Indian music than the rock for which Harrison was most famed . " Unterberger describes the box set as " a bountiful gathering of some of Shankar 's more accessible recordings " and highlights Chants of India as the most effective collaboration between the two artists . PopMatters contributor <unk> <unk> described the box set as " a special gift for [ Shankar 's ] fans " on the occasion of his 90th birthday , and " worthy of a man of such esteemed stature " . <unk> concludes of the partnership : " The diligence of Harrison brought Ravi Shankar , Indian music and Eastern spirituality soundly into Western collective consciousness .

 = Metanephrops challengeri = 
 Metanephrops challengeri ( commonly known as the New Zealand lobster or New Zealand scampi ) is a species of slim , pink lobster that lives around the coast of New Zealand . It is typically 13 – 18 cm ( 5 – 7 in ) long and weighs around 100 g ( 3 @.@ 5 oz ) . The carapace and abdomen are smooth , and adults are white with pink and brown markings and a conspicuous pair of long , slim claws . M. challengeri lives in burrows at depths of 140 – 640 m ( 460 – 2 @,@ 100 ft ) in a variety of sediments . Although individuals can live for up to 15 years , the species shows low fecundity , where small numbers of larvae hatch at an advanced stage . 
 M. challengeri is a significant prey item for ling , as well as being an important fishery species for human consumption ; trawlers catch around 1 @,@ 000 t ( 2 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 lb ) per year under the limitations of New Zealand 's Quota Management System . The species was first collected by the Challenger expedition of 1872 – 1876 , but only described as separate from related species by Heinrich Balss in 1914 . Although originally classified in the genus Nephrops , it was moved in 1972 to a new genus , Metanephrops , along with most other species then classified in Nephrops . 
 = = Description = = 
 Metanephrops challengeri is a slender lobster , typically 13 – 18 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 1 – 7 @.@ 1 in ) long , but exceptionally up to 25 cm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) , and weighing up to 100 grams ( 3 @.@ 5 oz ) each . Its chelipeds ( legs bearing the main chelae , or claws ) are long , narrow , and slightly unequal . The second and third pairs of pereiopods also end in small claws , but the fourth and fifth pairs do not . The carapace is smooth , and extends forwards into a long , narrow rostrum , only slightly shorter than the carapace . 
 Adults are mostly white , but the front half of the rostrum , and the sides of the abdomen , are pink . Bright red bands extend across the base of the rostrum , the posterior edge of the carapace , the chelipeds , and each of the abdominal segments . The dorsal parts of the abdomen are brown , and there are two brown saddles on the dorsal carapace . 
 M. challengeri is considered to have the most primitive morphology of any species of Metanephrops , having even fewer novelties than the oldest known fossil species , M. <unk> . Its rostrum is longer than that of other species in the thomsoni species group , and the ridge along the midline of the carapace only has two small spines . Unlike some other species of Metanephrops , the carapace is smooth , as are the abdominal <unk> , and the chelipeds are covered in fine granules . 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 Metanephrops challengeri reaches sexual maturity at the age of 3 – 4 years , and may live up to 15 years in total . Females produce very large eggs in small numbers ; they are typically around 2 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 1 in ) in diameter , and are blue in colour . The larvae hatch at the zoea stage ( equivalent to the third zoea of the Northern Hemisphere species Nephrops norvegicus ) . The zoea larvae are 10 @.@ 0 – 11 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 – 0 @.@ 45 in ) long , and possess all the appendages of the cephalothorax , including the pereiopods , which are used for swimming , but no pleopods ( appendages of the abdomen ) . This larval stage lasts less than four days , before the young moult into the post @-@ larval stage . The post @-@ larva swims using its pleopods . The post @-@ larva later moults into the adult form . Larvae are rarely seen in the wild , confirming that the development to the bottom @-@ dwelling post @-@ larva is rapid . 
 = = Distribution and ecology = = 
 Metanephrops challengeri lives around the coasts of New Zealand , including the Chatham Islands , at depths of 140 – 640 metres ( 460 – 2 @,@ 100 ft ) . It lives in burrows in a variety of " suitable cohesive " sediments , and is a significant prey item for ling ( <unk> <unk> ) . Lobsters have few parasites , the most important for M. challengeri being the microsporidian <unk> <unk> . This can cause " destruction of the skeletal and heart muscles of infected lobsters " , but its significance for the animals and for the fishing industry remains unclear . When it was described in 2010 , M. <unk> was the first microsporidian to be isolated from a true lobster . 
 = = Fisheries = = 
 Metanephrops challengeri has been harvested commercially since the 1980s . Between the season of 1988 / 89 and 1990 / 91 , the amount of scampi caught around New Zealand increased from only 55 @,@ 000 kilograms ( 121 @,@ 000 lb ) to around 500 @,@ 000 kg ( 1 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 lb ) . Catch limits were introduced in 1990 / 91 , and now 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 kg ( 2 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 lb ) is caught annually by trawlers . The fishery is centred on four areas of continental shelf of the submerged continent Zealandia : the Campbell Plateau around the Auckland Islands , Chatham Rise , along the Wairarapa coast , and in the Bay of Plenty . 
 Most of the fishing vessels used to capture M. challengeri are 20 – 40 metres ( 66 – 131 ft ) long , with " double or triple trawl rigs of low headline height " . There is considerable variation in the catch per unit effort between different depths , between different geographical areas and between different years . M. challengeri is considered a luxury foodstuff . Most of the catch is exported and as a result , it is rarely seen in restaurants in New Zealand . 
 Metanephrops challengeri was the subject of a 2003 select committee inquiry in the New Zealand parliament , after allegations of corruption arose against officers of the Ministry of Fisheries . Although the allegations were quashed , the inquiry ruled that preferential treatment had been given to the large fishing company <unk> Fisheries . In response , the government introduced M. challengeri into their Quota Management System and paid compensation to some fishermen who had a justified grievance . Under <unk> , an overall limit of 1 @,@ 291 @,@ 000 kg ( 2 @,@ 846 @,@ 000 lb ) was put in place for M. challengeri in 2011 . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Metanephrops challengeri is currently listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List , due in part to the Quota Management System put in place by the New Zealand government . The species does appear to be declining , however , based both on burrow counts and analyses of catch per unit effort . Estimates of the total population size of M. challengeri vary depending on the methods used . Based on indirect measures , such as burrow counts , there may be as many as 28 million individuals , and the annual catch might represent only 2 % – 4 % of the total population . Using more reliable figures based on those animals seen during surveys , there may be only 2 – 11 million individuals available to trawlers , and the annual catch may remove 12 % – 28 % of that population . Bycatch from the New Zealand scampi fishery has included the New Zealand sea lion , <unk> hookeri , which is considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Metanephrops challengeri was first described by Heinrich Balss in 1914 , under the name Nephrops challengeri . Two specimens had been collected on the Challenger expedition from benthic <unk> ooze at a depth of 275 fathoms ( 1 @,@ 650 ft ; 503 m ) , on the Challenger Plateau in the Tasman Sea ( 38 ° 50 @.@ 5 ′ S 169 ° 20 ′ E ) . They had been included by Charles Spence Bate in his report on the crustaceans collected by the Challenger expedition , but were not separated from " Nephrops thomsoni " ( now Metanephrops thomsoni ) , which was described by Spence Bate as a new species . Balss recognised that Spence Bate 's N. thomsoni covered two species and , restricting the name M. thomsoni to the species containing the type specimens designated by Spence Bate ( from the Philippines ) , created a new species for the species from New Zealand . Balss chose the two specimens seen by Spence Bate to be the type specimens of his new species , Nephrops challengeri . Both were females , and they have been deposited at the Natural History Museum in London . 
 The species was transferred to a new genus , Metanephrops ( along with every other extant species then in Nephrops , except its type species , Nephrops norvegicus ) by Richard Jenkins of the University of Adelaide in 1972 . Jenkins placed M. challengeri among the " thomsoni group " within the genus Metanephrops , alongside M. thomsoni , M. <unk> , M. <unk> and M. sinensis . Jenkins inferred that this group of species had originated off northern Australia or in Indonesia , and that M. challengeri had reached New Zealand in the late Tertiary and displaced M. <unk> , which formerly lived there . More recently , findings from molecular phylogenetics suggest that M. challengeri has a basal position in the genus , possibly linked to M. <unk> , and that the genus may have originated at high latitudes in the South Atlantic . 
 = La Coupole = 
 La Coupole ( English : The Dome ) , also known as the Coupole d <unk> @-@ Wizernes and originally codenamed <unk> 21 ( Building Project 21 ) or Schotterwerk Nordwest ( Northwest Gravel Works ) , is a Second World War bunker complex in the Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais department of northern France , about 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) from Saint @-@ Omer , and some 14 @.@ 4 kilometers ( 8 @.@ 9 miles ) south @-@ southeast from the less developed Blockhaus d <unk> V @-@ 2 launch installation in the same area . It was built by the forces of Nazi Germany between 1943 and 1944 to serve as a launch base for V @-@ 2 rockets directed against London and southern England , and is the earliest known precursor to modern underground missile silos still in existence . 
 Constructed in the side of a disused chalk quarry , the most prominent feature of the complex is an immense concrete dome , to which its modern name refers . It was built above a network of tunnels housing storage areas , launch facilities and crew quarters . The facility was designed to store a large stockpile of V @-@ 2s , warheads and fuel and was intended to launch V @-@ 2s on an industrial scale . Dozens of missiles a day were to be fuelled , prepared and launched in rapid sequence against London and southern England . 
 Following repeated heavy bombing by Allied forces during Operation Crossbow , the Germans were unable to complete the construction works and the complex never entered service . It was captured by the Allies in September 1944 , partially demolished on the orders of Winston Churchill to prevent its reuse as a military base , and then abandoned . It remained derelict until the mid @-@ 1990s . In 1997 it opened to the public for the first time , as a museum . Exhibits in the tunnels and under the dome tell the story of the German occupation of France during World War II , the V @-@ weapons and the history of space exploration . 
 = = Background = = 
 The V @-@ 2 rocket was one of several innovative long @-@ range weapons developed by the Germans after the failure of the Luftwaffe to strike a decisive blow against Britain . It was a revolutionary weapon – the world 's first operational <unk> – that had been developed in a secret programme begun in 1936 . The German leadership hoped that a barrage of rockets unleashed against London would force Britain out of the war . Although Adolf Hitler was at first ambivalent , he eventually became an enthusiastic supporter of the V @-@ 2 programme as Allied air forces carried out increasingly devastating attacks on German cities . 
 The 12 @.@ 5 @-@ ton missile , standing 14 metres ( 46 ft ) high on its launch pad , was fuelled primarily by liquid oxygen ( LOX ) and methyl alcohol . Deploying the V @-@ 2 on a large scale required far more LOX than was available from existing production sites in Germany and the occupied countries . New sources of LOX were required , situated close to the missile launching sites to reduce as far as possible the loss of propellant through evaporation . The missile 's operational range of 320 kilometres ( 200 mi ) meant that the launch sites had to be fairly close to the English Channel or southern North Sea coasts , in northern France , Belgium or the western Netherlands . 
 Because of the complexity of the missile and the need for extensive testing prior to launch , the V @-@ 2 's designers at the Peenemünde Army Research Center favoured using heavily defended fixed sites where the missiles could be stored , armed , and fuelled from an on @-@ site LOX production plant before launching . But the German Army and the V @-@ 2 project 's head , Major @-@ General Walter Dornberger , were concerned that the sites would be vulnerable to aerial attack by the Allies . The Army 's preferred option was to use <unk> , mobile firing batteries , which presented a much smaller target for the Allied air forces . 
 The Army was nonetheless overruled by Hitler , who had a long @-@ standing preference for huge , grandiose constructions . He preferred fixed installations along the lines of the virtually impregnable U @-@ boat pens that had been built to protect Germany 's U @-@ boat fleet . In March 1943 , he ordered the construction of a massive bunker ( now known as the Blockhaus d 'Éperlecques ) in the Forest of Éperlecques near Watten , north of Saint @-@ Omer . The bunker was soon spotted by Allied reconnaissance , and on 27 August 1943 , a raid by 187 Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress bombers wrecked the construction site before it could be completed . A surviving portion was reused by the Germans as a LOX production facility . 
 = = Design and location = = 
 The successful attack against the Watten bunker forced the German Army to find an alternative location for a launch site nearby . They had already taken possession of an old quarry between the villages of <unk> and Wizernes , south @-@ west of Saint @-@ Omer and some 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) south of the Watten bunker , near the Aa river alongside the Boulogne – Saint @-@ Omer railway line , about three @-@ quarters of a mile ( 1 km ) from Wizernes station . The quarry had been designated for use as a missile storage depot where V @-@ 2s would be housed in tunnels bored into the chalk hillside before being transported for launching . The Germans undertook major work in August 1943 to lay extensive railway sidings to connect the quarry to the main line . 
 On 30 September 1943 , Hitler met with Albert Speer , the Minister of Armaments and War Production , and Franz Xaver Dorsch , the chief engineer of the Todt Organisation , to discuss plans for a replacement for the out @-@ of @-@ commission Watten facility . Dorsch proposed to transform the Wizernes depot into a vast bomb @-@ proof underground complex that would require a million tons of concrete to build . It would be constructed within a network of tunnels to be dug inside the hillside at the edge of the quarry . A concrete dome , 16 @.@ 7 feet ( 5 @.@ 1 m ) thick , 71 metres ( 233 ft ) in diameter and weighing 55 @,@ 000 tons , would be built over the top of the central part of the facility to protect it from Allied bombing . Beneath it , about 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) of tunnels were to be dug into the chalk hillside to accommodate workshops , storerooms , fuel supplies , a LOX manufacturing plant , generators , barracks and a hospital . 
 A standard gauge railway tunnel , codenamed Ida , was to be built on a curving path that would connect it with both the east- and west @-@ bound main line railway , allowing trains to run straight through the complex without needing to reverse or be turned around . This would serve as the main unloading station , where missiles and supplies would be offloaded onto trolleys that would transport them into the connecting galleries Mathilde and Hugo . Hugo connected in turn with Sophie , a dead @-@ end railway tunnel branching from the main line into Ida . Each of the main tunnels had a number of unnamed side tunnels of the same dimensions as the main tunnels and up to 90 metres ( 300 ft ) long . The central feature of the complex was a huge octagonal rocket @-@ preparation chamber directly under the dome . It was never completed but would have been 41 metres ( 135 ft ) in diameter and up to 33 metres ( 108 ft ) high . A number of intermediate floors , possibly as many as ten , would have been built up the sides of the chamber . 
 The western side of the chamber opened onto two tall passageways , opening onto two tracks to the outdoor launchpads , with the tracked passages and launchpads named Gustav ( the southerly @-@ located pad ) and Gretchen ( the northerly @-@ located pad ) , both on the western side of the domed complex . Each was to have been protected by bomb @-@ proof doors made of steel and concrete . The passageways were to be 4 metres ( 13 ft ) wide and at least 17 metres ( 56 ft ) high and were angled in a Y @-@ shape , generally exiting westwards into the quarry . The outdoor launchpads for the V @-@ 2 rockets would have been at the end of each passageway . The two passageways were angled at 64 ° 50 ' and 99 ° 50 ' west of north respectively – not aligned with any probable target but merely permitting the rockets to be transported to sufficiently widely separated launch pads . 
 The facility was designed , as was its predecessor at Watten , to receive , process and launch V @-@ 2 rockets at a high rate . Trains carrying V @-@ 2s would enter the heart of the complex through the Ida rail tunnel , where they would be unloaded . A large number of V @-@ 2s could be stored in the side tunnels ; LOX would also be produced on @-@ site ready for use . When the time came , the rockets would be moved into the octagonal preparation chamber where they would be lifted to a vertical position for fuelling and arming . From there they would be transported on motorised launch carriages , still in a vertical position , through the Gustav and Gretchen passageways . The launch pads were located at the end of the track on the floor of the quarry , from where the missiles would be fired . 
 The priority target for the V @-@ 2s was 188 kilometres ( 117 mi ) away : London , which Hitler wanted to see pulverised by the end of 1943 . The Allies were alarmed when an analyst found that part of the complex was aligned within half a degree of the Great Circle bearing on New York , and its equipment was large enough to accommodate a rocket twice the size of the V @-@ 2 : the " America Rocket " , the proposed A10 intercontinental ballistic missile . 
 Although physically separate , another facility built in nearby <unk> was an integral part of the Wizernes complex . <unk> C was built to house a <unk> radio command guidance system which could be used to send course corrections to missiles launched from Wizernes to fine @-@ tune their trajectory during the launch phase . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The Allies first noticed construction activity at Wizernes in mid @-@ August 1943 when the Germans began building railway track and the offloading stores into the old quarry . After Hitler authorised the decision to turn the depot into a missile launch site , construction was stepped up . Work on the dome began in November 1943 and tunnelling in the cliff face below began in December . At the start of January , Allied reconnaissance aircraft observed an elaborate system of camouflage on the hill top , installed to conceal the dome . The building works were greatly hindered by the constant air @-@ raid warnings , which stopped work 229 times in May 1944 alone . In response to Hitler 's desire to see the site completed the workforce was expanded substantially from 1 @,@ 100 in April 1944 to nearly 1 @,@ 400 by June . About 60 % of the workers were Germans ; skilled workers , such as miners from Westphalia , were recruited to excavate the tunnels and build the dome . The remainder were principally Frenchmen conscripted by the Service du travail <unk> ( STO ) , plus Soviet prisoners of war . The project was overseen by several large German construction companies , with Philipp Holzman A.G. of Frankfurt am Main and the <unk> <unk> and <unk> GmbH serving as the chief contractors . 
 One of the most difficult challenges faced by the Germans was constructing the great dome while under regular air attack . The dome 's designer , Todt Organisation engineer Werner Flos , devised a plan under which the dome would be built first , flat upon the ground , and the soil underneath it would be excavated so that the construction works below would be protected against aerial attacks . A circular trench was excavated on the top of the hill above the quarry to an outside diameter of 84 metres ( 276 ft ) . The dome was built within this trench and the galleries and octagonal preparation chamber were excavated below . 
 As an additional bomb @-@ proofing method , the dome was surrounded by a bomb @-@ proof " skirt " or <unk> of steel @-@ reinforced concrete , 14 metres ( 46 ft ) wide and 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) thick . This was supported by a series of buttresses , which were not tied into the dome itself , above the entrances to the Gustav and Gretchen tunnels . Another concrete structure was tied into the skirt to the north @-@ west of the dome , which was perhaps intended for use as an observation and control tower . A separate underground building was constructed on the western side of the quarry to serve as a hospital and as offices for the engineers . A Decauville narrow @-@ gauge railway was installed on the quarry floor to transport supplies from the main line to the construction site . 
 A cube @-@ shaped concrete building was constructed on the top of the hill , next to the dome . This was intended to be used as the bomb @-@ proof outlet for a ventilation and air conditioning shaft . It was an essential component of a facility where dangerous and explosive gases were expected to be used in large quantities on a daily basis . It was never finished , and the Allies found when they captured the site that the ventilation shaft had not been fully excavated . The building survived the bombing intact and is still prominently visible today . 
 Unlike its sister site at Watten , there was no on @-@ site power plant . Electricity at Wizernes was provided by a connection to the main electric grid , with power consumption estimated at between 5 @,@ 000 and 6 @,@ 000 kVA . 
 = = Discovery and Allied attacks = = 
 The Allies became aware of the Wizernes site in August 1943 when the Germans began laying extensive new rail sidings which were spotted by RAF reconnaissance flights . Late 1943 , a Belgian , Jacques de <unk> , supported by German opponents , informed MI5 about the existence of a rocket production site in Saint @-@ Omer . MI5 did not believe Jacques de <unk> , who has been interned for the rest of the war in Latchmere House . In November 1943 , the Allied Central Interpretation Unit reported that the Germans had begun constructing the concrete dome and were undertaking tunnelling works in the east face of the quarry . However , it was not until the following March that the Allies added the site to the list of targets for Operation Crossbow , the ongoing bombing campaign against V @-@ weapon sites that had already wrecked the Watten bunker and numerous V @-@ 1 launching sites . Over the next few months , the USAAF and RAF carried out 16 air raids involving 811 bombers that dropped some 4 @,@ 260 tons of bombs . The bombing caused destruction across a wide area , killing 55 residents of the nearby village of <unk> . 
 Conventional bombing raids only achieved a single bomb hit on the dome itself , causing negligible damage . However , in June and July 1944 the RAF began attacking the site with 12 @,@ 000 pounds ( 5 @,@ 400 kg ) , ground @-@ penetrating Tallboy bombs . The external construction works were completely wrecked by the bombing and one Tallboy landed just beside the dome , blowing out the entire quarry cliff face and burying the entrances to the Gustav and Gretchen tunnels . The entrance to Sophie was also buried , leaving Ida as the only entrance to the facility . The dome was unscathed but the buttresses supporting the protective <unk> were dislodged and slid partway down into the quarry . Serious damage was also caused to the tunnels beneath the dome . The damage made it impossible to continue work on the site . Dornberger complained : " Persistent air attack with heavy and super @-@ heavy bombs so battered the rock all around that in the spring of 1944 landslides made further work impossible . " His staff reported on 28 July 1944 that , although the dome had not been hit by the Tallboys , " the whole area around has been so churned up that it is unapproachable , and the bunker is jeopardised from underneath . " 
 Although three launch battalions were formed by the Germans in late 1943 , they never got the chance to deploy to the V @-@ weapons launch sites at Watten and Wizernes . On 3 July 1944 , the Oberkommando West authorised the cessation of construction at the heavily damaged sites . On 18 July 1944 , Hitler abandoned plans for launching V @-@ 2s from bunkers and authorized the downgrading of the Wizernes bunker to make it a LOX production facility . However , these plans were overtaken by the Allied liberation of Northern France following the Normandy landings . The site was finally abandoned a few days before the Allies reached it at the start of September during the rapid liberation of the area by British , American , Canadian and Polish troops . British engineers inspected it on 5 September . 
 = = Post war investigations = = 
 Shortly after the Wizernes site had been captured in September 1944 , Duncan Sandys , the head of the British " Crossbow Committee " investigating the V @-@ weapons programme , ordered the constitution of a Technical Inter @-@ Services Mission under Colonel T.R.B. Sanders . It was given the task of investigating the sites at Mimoyecques , Siracourt , Watten , and Wizernes , collectively known to the Allies as the " Heavy Crossbow " sites . Sanders ' report was submitted to the War Cabinet on 19 March 1945 . 
 The purpose of the Wizernes site had been unclear prior to its capture but Sanders was able to deduce its connection with the V @-@ 2 from the dimensions of the complex and some intelligence information that his team had been able to retrieve . Sanders ' report concluded that it was " an assembly site for long projectiles most conveniently handled and prepared in a vertical position " . He conjectured the approximate length of the projectiles from the height of the Gustav and Gretchen tunnels , though he noted that there was some doubt about the height of the doors at the tunnel entrances . Segments of the doors had been recovered from a storage dump near Watten railway station , but were incomplete . Judging from the size of the tunnel entrance , the maximum size of the projectile could have been between 17 metres ( 56 ft ) and 24 metres ( 79 ft ) in length and 4 metres ( 13 ft ) in breadth . ( This was substantially larger than the V @-@ 2 , which measured 14 metres ( 46 ft ) long and 3 @.@ 55 metres ( 11 @.@ 6 ft ) wide . ) Two witnesses interviewed by the Sanders team reported " an intention of firing a projectile 18 metres long " . Sanders noted that " the dimensions of the site make it suitable for the <unk> ( V @-@ 2 ) rocket , but the possibility of a new rocket up to half as long again as the <unk> and twice the weight cannot be ruled out . " He concluded that much of the site was becoming unsafe due to the progressive collapse of timbering and recommended that the tunnels and workings under the dome should be destroyed to prevent subsequent accidents or misuse . 
 The site reverted to private ownership after the war . As the quarry had long since been worked out , it was abandoned . The tunnels were not destroyed but were sealed off , though at some point they were reopened by local people and could be entered ; the octagon remained sealed off with a ceiling @-@ to @-@ floor barricade . The quarry itself remained in almost the same condition as it had been in 1944 , with sections of railway track still in place on the quarry floor . The hospital section remained relatively intact and was used by the local gendarmes as a shooting range .

 In 1986 , the Espace Naturel Régional in Lille earmarked 10 million francs to develop the site as a tourist attraction for the Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais region with the intention of establishing a World War II museum there . The plan was publicised in a special open weekend on 20 – 21 June 1987 , attended by over 20 @,@ 000 people , in which the dome 's designer Werner Flos met Professor Reginald Victor Jones , a surviving member of the " Crossbow Committee " , at Wizernes . The Ida tunnel and side chambers were opened to the public and used for an audio @-@ visual exhibition of the site 's history . 
 Local historian Yves le Maner was charged with the task of developing the project while a feasibility study was conducted into the possibility of completing some of the original excavation work to make the site safe for public access . The plans were approved in 1993 and the site was purchased by the Commune de <unk> . The following year , the Conseil Général du Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais acquired the site . The 69 @-@ million @-@ franc project ( £ 7 @.@ 5 million at 1997 prices ) was largely underwritten by the Conseil Général , which provided 35 million francs , with another 17 million coming from the regional council . The European taxpayer provided a further 12 million , the French State provided 3 million and the Saint @-@ Omer municipal administration funded the remaining 1 million francs ; a number of private shareholders were also involved . The Societé d <unk> du Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais was contracted to carry out the development work , which involved excavating a further two metres ( six feet ) beneath the dome , clearing out and completing the unfinished concreting of some of the tunnels , building an exhibition centre and car park in the quarry floor and installing a lift to carry visitors up from the octagon to the dome . 
 The museum opened in May 1997 . Visitors enter and leave through the Ida railway tunnel , though the rails have been removed and the floor levelled . Short branch tunnels lead off on either side ; originally used for storage , they now display wartime objects . Headphone stands along the way present multi @-@ lingual accounts of the construction and purpose of the facility . The tour continues along the Mathilde tunnel to reach a lift that has been installed to bring visitors up to the space beneath the dome , where the main exhibition area is located . Focusing on the story of the V @-@ weapons , life in occupied France , and the conquest of space after the war , the tour presents audio @-@ visual displays in English , French , Dutch and German . The museum houses a large number of original artifacts including a V @-@ 1 provided by London 's Science Museum and a V @-@ 2 provided by the Smithsonian Institution , and incorporates a memorial to the 8 @,@ 000 people who were shot in or deported from the Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais region during the war ; computer terminals track the paths of several hundred of the deportees . In 2011 , the museum welcomed 120 @,@ 000 visitors . In July 2012 , the museum opened a planetarium as part of <unk> , a newly established Centre de <unk> <unk> pour le <unk> de l <unk> à la <unk> ( Resource Centre for the development of digital access to knowledge ) . The € 6 million centre is funded by the Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais department , the Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais region , the French state , the European taxpayer and the <unk> of Saint @-@ Omer . Since 2010 , the museum has also managed the V @-@ 3 site of the Fortress of Mimoyecques .

 Bahrain Tamarod ( also spelled Bahrain <unk> ; Arabic : <unk> البحرين ; literally " Bahrain Rebellion " ) , also known as August 14 Rebellion , was a three @-@ day protest campaign in Bahrain that began on 14 August 2013 , the forty @-@ second anniversary of Bahrain Independence Day and the two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year anniversary of the Bahraini uprising . The call for protests had started in early July following and inspired by the Egyptian Tamarod Movement that led to the removal of President Mohamed Morsi . Calling for a " free and democratic Bahrain " , Tamarod activists , who mobilized social networking websites , said their movement was peaceful , national and non @-@ sectarian . They called for gradual peaceful civil disobedience starting from 14 August . The movement gained the support of opposition societies and human rights activists , including those languishing in prison . The government however , repeatedly warned against the protests , promising those who participate with legal action and forceful confrontation . Rights activists and media reported that authorities had stepped up their crackdown campaigns in the weeks leading to the protests . 
 In late July , the king called for a parliamentary special session . The pro @-@ government parliament submitted 22 recommendations , some of them calling for stripping those convicted of " terrorist crimes " from their nationality and banning of almost all protests in the capital , Manama . Despite outcries from the United Nations , Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch , the king endorsed the recommendations and issued two decrees to their effect . The Prime Minister asked his ministers to carry out the recommendations immediately and issued several warnings against protests . In the following days , the government arrested three photographers , two bloggers , a lawyer and a politician , and prevented human rights activists and journalists from entering the country , deported an American teacher and reportedly encircled entire areas with barbed wire . The government denied arrests had targeted activists . A few days before 14 August , activists said they had gathered tens of thousands of signatures in support of highly anticipated protests . 
 The day of 14 August witnessed heavy deployment of security forces , which used tear gas and birdshot against hundreds @-@ to @-@ thousands of protesters who gathered in several locations throughout the country . Many shops were closed in response to Tamarod 's call for a general strike . Opposition activists and media reported over 60 demonstrations throughout the country . The opposition and several citizens accused authorities of cutting Internet connections . The government blocked a website covering the protests , but activists and citizen journalists provided live coverage on social media websites , and Anonymous targeted a government website . At least twenty protesters were arrested and ten injured , two critically , activists said . The tightened security measures have succeeded in preventing large @-@ scale protests in Manama . On 15 and 16 August , smaller protests occurred in several locations which police dispersed without injuries . 
 Tamarod and Al Wefaq opposition society praised the protests and said they were successful . The government of Bahrain however said protests did not affect everyday life . The United States said it supported freedom of expression and assembly , and voiced its concern at the chances of violence . Analysts were divided between those who expected protests to be huge and those that did not see them having any chance . They were also divided about the reasons behind the absence of mass protests in Manama , some blaming it on the security forces , others on protest organizers . 
 = = Background = = 
 Beginning in February 2011 , Bahrain saw sustained pro @-@ democracy protests , centered at Pearl Roundabout in the capital of Manama , as part of the wider Arab Spring . Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February ( later referred to by protesters as Bloody Thursday ) , which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured . In March , martial law was declared and Saudi troops were called in . Despite the hard crackdown and official ban , the protests continued . According to the International Federation for Human Rights , at least 80 people were killed during the unrest .

 Inspired by the Egyptian Tamarod Movement that led to the removal of President Mohamed Morsi , Bahraini opposition activists formed Bahrain Rebellion Movement on 3 July 2013 and called for mass protests starting on 14 August , the forty @-@ second anniversary of Bahrain Independence Day under the banner Bahrain Tamarod . The day also marked the two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year anniversary of the Bahraini uprising . The movement which is also known as the August 14 Rebellion , identified itself as " a movement calling for awareness , nationalism , sovereignty , independence and legitimacy , with a message of love , loyalty and dedication to all of the Bahraini people in rebellion against the authorities . " One of its members said they were a youth movement , not a political party . A Reuters article described Tamarod as " a loose grouping of opposition activists who came together in early July to push for a ' free and democratic Bahrain ' through mass anti @-@ government demonstrations " . 
 Activists mobilized social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter to campaign for the protest movement . They issued their first statement on 4 July titled " Bahrain has Risen up " and " The August 14 Rebels " describing their goals and reasons . " [ The people of Bahrain want ] a nation that embraces all its citizens . We want a Bahrain to which we can all belong ... This movement is for freedom , for which Bahrainis have long yearned and made great sacrifices over many decades of struggle . " The statement also accused authorities of confiscating the people 's values and rights , and " restrict [ ing ] their movement and activities . " 
 In an interview with France 24 , Hussain Yousif , a member of the Bahrain Rebellion Movement said the movement will employ all types of peaceful civil resistance including the call for a gradual civil disobedience starting on 14 August with abstaining from shopping , commercial and government transactions such as paying electricity bills . He highlighted the royal family 's almost complete monopoly on power , the political stalemate and ongoing human rights violations as main motivations . Yousif added that the main principles of the movement were peacefulness , non @-@ exclusion and recognizing the people 's right to self @-@ determination , and called the authorities to understand their demands and refrain from using violence against protesters . " We use pure national slogans , not belonging to any specific sect or ideology , " he said . The Christian Science Monitor said the 14 August protests were " the latest installment of a two @-@ year long protest movement . " Protests were planned to last for three days . 
 Left without an epicenter after the destruction of Pearl Roundabout in 2011 , Tamarod announced their plans to stage peaceful protests in nine different locations , all in the streets , with the largest expected in Manama . One of the protests was planned near the U.S. embassy , a country that protest organizers had called on to use its influence to prevent government crackdown and protect demonstrations , which they said was an " ethical responsibility " for the U.S. " We hope that you may convey our deep concern to the US State Department and the US Congress to exert a real political pressure on Bahraini regime to avoid any fatal crackdown and bloodshed , " they said in an open letter . 
 = = Events leading to the protests = = 
 Soon after Tamarod 's first statement , the Haq Movement for Liberty and Democracy announced its support for protest plans . " Let August 14 be the day of rebellion against the ruling gang in Bahrain , " the movement said in a statement . The February 14 Youth Coalition also supported the protests and called for civil disobedience for 3 days . The youth group also told participants to avoid clashing with police . Ali Salman , leader of Al Wefaq opposition society welcomed the Tamarod plans . " We support any peaceful movement , at any time and from any party . Everybody has the right to protest ... the call for protests on August 14 shows that the Bahraini people will not cease to demonstrate until they achieve their demands , " he added . Al Wefaq however , stopped short of taking part in the Tamarod movement , blaming their secession on clashes between security forces and protesters . " [ I ] t is going to be a peaceful movement but having said that I also expect clashes ... I only pray that there are no victims , " said Ali Salman . 
 Jailed activist Zainab al @-@ Khawaja smuggled a letter from prison in which she called people to participate in Tamarod protests . " On 14 February 2011 , the people of Bahrain took to the street to demand their rights ... and on 14 August , the day of Tamarod , the people have to go out with same strength in order to send a message to the world and the regime that they have not and will never back down , " the letter read . Zainab 's father , Abdulhadi al @-@ Khawaja who is also jailed delivered a message via Mohammed al @-@ Maskati of Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights ( <unk> ) in which he called for " a peaceful <unk> on August 14th ... under the banner of ' Right to Self determination ' . " Another jailed rights activist , Nabeel Rajab also announced his support for Tamarod protests . " I call for rebellion [ <unk> ] against all laws that violate the rights of the people . The law should be enacted to establish justice and equality between people and the protection of rights , " his Twitter account , followed by 211 @,@ 000 + and controlled by others quoted him saying . 
 On 13 July , the Ministry of Interior ( MoI ) warned against joining the 14 August protests which it called " illegal demonstrations and activities that endanger security " . The MoI said it will " deal with any attempt to disturb security and stability " . In anticipation to the 14 August protests , the MoI stepped up security measures and further warned that it will take legal action toward those who participate . The MOI has warned Bahrainis : 
 Not to respond or react to incitement from political events and social media posts that use ' Rebellion 14 August ' and encourage the overthrow of the government . Rallies and activities that affect security , public order , civil peace and the interests of the people are against the law . Participants will have legal procedures taken against them . 
 The Prime Minister joined the MoI in warning against planned protests . The Al Wefaq opposition movement slammed the warnings and affirmed " the [ people 's ] right to protest peacefully " . " This will not solve the political crisis . The solution is in satisfying the people 's aspirations for liberty , social justice and democracy , " Al Wefaq added . Other opposition societies such as National Democratic Action Society ( Waad ) and Nationalist Democratic Assembly also joined Al Wefaq in affirming the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly . Mainstream opposition societies cancelled a planned mass protest on 14 August , " because of the heavily intimidating security presence in Manama " . 
 Tamarod is reported to have gained popularity among the opposition since mid @-@ July , prompting the United States Embassy in Manama to eventually issue a warning for U.S. citizens to avoid certain areas in Bahrain on 14 August . The selected areas were mostly opposition strongholds . For weeks , the government was reported to have intensified its house raids and arrests against over five hundred wanted activists , many of them sleeping outside their homes for months in anticipation of such raids . 
 Maryam al @-@ Khawaja , the acting head of Bahrain Centre for Human Rights ( BCHR ) said nightly raids were now occurring all day long and that physical , psychological and sexual torture had continued . " Since the announcing of the planned protest on the 14th of August ... [ we have been seeing ] a very severe escalation in the crackdown , " she said . She added that Tamarod protests were " part and parcel of the ongoing uprising that started on 14 February 2011 " . According to activists , up to 400 were arrested during the month of Ramadhan ( 10 July – 7 August ) and more than 100 houses were raided in Manama alone . 
 = = = Parliament emergency session = = = 
 On 28 July , the Parliament held an extraordinary session at the request of the King , Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa in which they submitted 22 recommendations calling for tougher penalties against " terrorist crimes " including stripping those convicted with inciting or committing such acts from their nationality and freezing their bank accounts as well as a ban on protests in the capital , Manama . Other recommendations included " increasing punishment for anyone propagating false information about Bahrain in social media networks " , " taking legal action against certain political associations which incite and support violent and terrorist acts " and " taking all possible measures to impose peace and security , even if it means imposing a state of national safety [ state of emergency ] " . 
 The parliament has been dominated by government supporters , especially after the opposition submitted their resignations in early 2011 in protest against government crackdown . According to RT , the Bahraini government often employs the terms " terrorists " or " thugs " to refer to protesters and has used " broad definitions of terrorism to detain scores of protesters and to convict several opposition leaders " . A week earlier , the government used an explosion as a pretext to block several planned anti @-@ government protests . 
 The session was held after weeks of escalations in clashes between protesters and security forces which had seen militant groups using bombs and police firing tear gas and birdshot , and the Minister of Justice said " terrorism " must be quelled before national reconciliation could begin . According to Reem Khalifa of the Associated Press , however , the session " appeared prompted by opposition calls for major protests Aug. 14 . " Khalil al @-@ <unk> of Al Wefaq said the recommendations were unconstitutional and that the session was a " popular cover [ for the authorities ] in order to issue its decrees . " Emile <unk> said the session was " a spectacle of venom , a display of vulgarity , and an unabashed nod to increased dictatorship . " He added that one MP referred to the Shia , who form the majority of citizens as " dogs " and that 14 August planned protests " drove the timing of the session " . 
 Bill Law of the BBC News said the " recommendations if implemented in full would effectively return the country to a state of martial law " . An unnamed western diplomat said the recommendations timing was likely due to 14 August protest plans and the increasing violence . Marc Jones said that many of the recommendations were already in place . " Thirty @-@ one Bahrainis were stripped of their citizenship back in November 2012 , and there has been a de facto ban on protests in Manama since last year , " he added and listed other examples of what he called " reactionary laws " already in place . 
 Maryam al @-@ Khawaja said the government was merely giving a legal cover for its practices that have been in place for years . On the other hand , Tareq Al Hassan , the Public Security Chief said the session was historical and that it did not target a specific group or sect , rather it targeted terrorists and instigators . " 14 August will pass just like regular days of the year and nothing will happen , " he added . 
 The King , the Crown Prince and the Prime Minister ( PM ) welcomed the recommendations of the Parliament . The King ordered their rapid codification while the PM asked his ministers to carry out the recommendations immediately , or face dismissal if they slowed down . On 6 August , the King issued two decrees banning all " demonstrations , sit @-@ ins , marches and public gatherings " in Manama ( except " sit @-@ ins outside [ offices of ] international organizations " ) , and jailing and / or fining parents if their minor children ( under 16 ) were found to take part in protests in two occasions within six months . During the Parliament recess period , the constitution of Bahrain allows the King to issue decrees which are effective as laws . 
 The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern about the recommendations , highlighting the right to nationality and asking the government of Bahrain " to fully comply with its international human rights commitments , including respect for freedom of expression and peaceful assembly , and association " . Amnesty International said the emergency decrees were outrageous , violated the international law and a " shameful attempt to completely ban any form of dissent and freedom of expression in the country " . " We fear that these draconian measures will be used in an attempt to legitimize state violence as new protests are being planned for 14 August , " said Amnesty 's regional director . A spokesman of the Bahraini government cited increasing violence including a policeman death and said the recommendations were " about trying to control the situation and trying to <unk> and secure people safety . " 
 Human Rights Watch also criticized the recommendations , calling them " a whole new set of draconian restrictions " that would create " a new state of emergency " . " The government has talked a lot about the need for national reconciliation but , once again , its actions in taking on a raft of stern new measures to suppress legitimate protest are undermining any prospects for successful dialogue , " its regional director , Nadim <unk> said . The International Federation for Human Rights and World Organization Against Torture " firmly denounce [ d ] " what they called " the intensifying crackdown on the Bahraini civil society " . Freedom House said the recommendations were " a serious new threat to human rights in Bahrain , particularly freedom of expression and assembly " , and that they violated the ICCPR treaty . The leader of Bahrain Press Associated said they were " a black page in the history [ of the Parliament ] " .

 Three days after the Parliamentary special session , the government escalated its crackdown , arresting a photographer , Hussain <unk> , a blogger and his lawyer , and has continued to deny visas to foreign journalists . The arrested blogger , Mohamed Hassan also worked as a fixer for foreign journalists visiting the country and his lawyer , <unk> <unk> was arrested after tweeting that Hassan was mistreated in prison . On 2 August , a second photographer , Qassim Zain <unk> was arrested . Several Bahrain @-@ based rights organizations wrote an open letter on 6 August co @-@ signed by a number of international NGOs asking other international NGOs , mainstream media , Bahrain allies and the United Nations to pay close attention to Bahrain over the next week , especially on 14 August , which they said would likely see the country " come under lockdown " . The letter said the rights situations in Bahrain has " rapidly deteriorated " during the previous weeks . 
 On 7 August , Al Jazeera English reporter , Hyder Abbasi was prevented from boarding a flight from Qatar to Bahrain . On 8 August , a third photographer , Ahmed Al @-@ <unk> was briefly arrested , threatened and beaten by plainclothes police . On 9 August , Bahraini @-@ Danish human rights activist Maryam al @-@ Khawaja was prevented from boarding a British Airways flight to Bahrain at the request of the Bahraini government . Al @-@ Khawaja who was planning to stay in Bahrain before and during 14 August said the move " show [ ed ] how nervous they [ the authorities ] are and how much they have to hide .

Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience . An activist reported that 7 journalists were in hiding due to house raids . 
 On 8 August , the February 14 Youth Coalition said they had gathered tens of thousands of signatures calling for the right to self @-@ determination . On 10 August , the Prime Minister renewed his warning against planned protests during a visit to Muharraq island . He also accused protesters of wanting " to change the regime and drag [ ging ] the country to chaos and ruin . " " [ T ] his island will burn to a cinder all those who seek to tamper with its security and stability , " he added . The same day an American teacher was deported from Bahrain due to her " radical writing , " the Ministry of State for Communications said . Erin Kilbride was accused of working as an unaccredited journalist writing for the outlawed Bahrain Centre for Human Rights ( BCHR ) and As @-@ Safir Lebanese newspaper , and of having links with Hezbollah . 
 " [ Her posting was ] deemed to incite hatred against the government and members of the Royal family , " the ministry added . Al @-@ Khawaja of BCHR denied Kilbride had written for them and said an As @-@ Safir journalist denied the allegations too . " That was something made up by the government , " she added . Bahraini authorities blocked <unk> , a website that offered timeline coverage for the protests within 24 hours of its launch on 10 August . A human rights activist said that despite the official ban and security checkpoints , a protest was held in Manama on 10 August , and was dispersed by police using stun grenades . On the other hand , the MoI reported that " terrorists " attacked a police patrol in Noaim using molotov cocktails . The Bahrain Mirror mentioned that all leaves for August were cancelled by several government agencies and ministries . 
 On 12 August , a human rights activist said police fired tear gas and stun grenades on several anti @-@ government protests , and arrested nine demonstrators . The same day , the PM issued another warning against protests after an urgent Ministerial meeting , saying his government will " forcefully confront " them . " [ The government ] will punish [ those ] who stand behind them in line with the recommendations of the Bahrain National Council [ parliament ] , " he added . Patrick Cockburn of The Independent said the PM warning showed the " nervousness " of Bahraini authorities ahead of the protests . The PM also held a meeting with the commander of Peninsula Shield Force , a joint Gulf Cooperation Council force that helped crackdown on protests in 2011 . The state @-@ controlled Bahrain News Agency ( BNA ) also reported that the PM headed a " high level meeting " attended by high @-@ ranking officials to talk over arrangements before protests . The PM said his government was " at a critical stage [ in the struggle to ] eliminate terrorism " . 
 On 13 August , Bahrain Mirror and activists said security forces have installed barbed wire around a number of residential areas expected to witness large protests . The areas were completely caged according to activists . Al Wefaq said authorities had turned some areas into a " vast prison for inhabitants . " The Associated Press reported that barbed wire with checkpoints in between had separated Shia neighborhoods from main roads and Reuters witnesses said security forces had deployed reinforcements , including armored vehicles by night . The area of the @-@ now demolished Pearl Roundabout was filled with hundreds of riot police standing next to armored personnel carriers . Tamarod spokesperson , Hussain Yousif said they will carry on with the protests despite government definite crackdown . The MoI said the heavy deployment was in order to " [ preserve ] security and order , and to guarantee an easy flow of traffic " . 
 On the same day , Bahraini authorities summoned the Lebanese ambassador in Bahrain to file a complaint against a conference held by Bahrain Rebellion Movement in Beirut . In the conference , opposition activists called for civil disobedience and mass protests , the BNA reported . A number of Bahraini opposition politicians and human rights activists have based their activities in Beirut where they enjoy more freedom . The BNA added that the Lebanese ambassador said his government was not supportive of the conference and that they did not wish to interfere in Bahraini internal affairs . A day earlier , the <unk> Al Asalah Islamic Society had criticized Lebanon for hosting the conference .

 Reporters Without Borders expressed its concern at what it described " a new upsurge in abusive treatment of journalists in the run @-@ up to the major ' Tamarod ' rally " . The France @-@ based NGO said authorities had arrested 2 bloggers and 3 photographers in recent days . " The authorities plan to impose a news blackout on the 14 August demonstration by jailing netizens and preventing journalists and human rights defenders from visiting Bahrain , " it added . Amnesty International issued a statement calling the government of Bahrain to allow Wednesday protests and expressed its fear that the new legislation will be used as a legal cover for quashing peaceful protests . " The Bahraini authorities must not crack down on mass anti @-@ government protests scheduled for tomorrow , " it said . The UK @-@ based NGO also condemned the arrest of " journalists , photographers , bloggers and others active on social media networks in recent days [ as a move to silence critics ] " . 
 The Bahraini government " vehemently refutes any allegations of targeted arrests , " said an Information Affairs Authority spokesperson . 
 Nicholas McGeehan of Human Rights Watch said the government preparations were unjustified , inappropriate and disproportionate . " Bahraini authorities have a grim recent history of using excessive and lethal force to suppress peaceful protests , followed by the persecution of protesters and even doctors who treated their wounds , " he added . The International Freedom of Expression Exchange described Bahrain authorities preparations as " pre @-@ emptive crackdown on a peaceful , nationwide protest that has been weeks in the planning . " The United States embassy said it would close its doors on 14 August and told Americans to " avoid non @-@ essential travel inside the country " . Naval Support Activity Bahrain , the base of United States Fifth Fleet ordered sailors to avoid Manama Souq , Bahrain City Centre and Seef Mall where protests were expected .

 Large numbers of security forces were deployed in Manama and helicopters hovered over . Roads leading to the city were guarded by security checkpoints and surrounded by barbed wire . Reuters reported that all shops were closed in some villages , while most shops in Manama remained open , with big police presence in the area , especially near Bab Al Bahrain . Tamarod had called for a general strike and pleaded businesses to close , while the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry issued a warning for businesses against responding to calls for a general strike , or risk facing legal action . An activist said protests started by dawn and that at least 3 were held in Manama . The Associated Press reported that small protests occurred in the morning and that most businesses " appeared to be shuttered " , prompting Al Wefaq to claim success for the general strike . BNA reported that the PM made a visit to a shopping mall in Manama to assure visitors it was " business as usual " . 
 In the early morning , up to 100 protesters took to the street in Saar village , west of Manama . The protest was peaceful and protesters were chanting anti @-@ government slogans and waving Bahraini flags , witnesses said . Shortly before the arrival of security forces , the protest dispersed peacefully . In another village south of Manama , the MoI reported that an Asian worker trying to open a blocked road was injured after getting attacked with molotov cocktails and that a main road in Muharraq was blocked with burning tires . It described both incidents as " terrorism " . Protests were also held in Malkiya , Juffair and Sitra where protesters held peaceful sit @-@ ins and formed human chains . Some protesters were sitting in front of their houses , still they were attacked by security forces , witnesses reported . A video posted on YouTube showed police arresting and beating two men who were sitting in front of a house . 
 In <unk> , west of Manama , police charged a group of 300 protesters who were restricted behind a barbed wire using tear gas and birdshot . Images by Reuters showed police beating an arrested protester after they dispersed the protest . In <unk> similar clashes occurred , with protesters hurling back molotov cocktails . No injuries were reported for both incidents . Later , police converged at Seef district in Manama , and " cordoned off the area using barbed wire " following a video message by Hussain Yousif to hold a rally there . Agence France @-@ Presse ( AFP ) witnesses reported that hundreds of protesters who gathered in several Shia villages faced police tear gas and birdshot . Citizen journalists and activists provided live photo coverage of the violence on Instagram and Twitter . 
 Human Rights First ( HRF ) estimated turnout to be in thousands . Al Wefaq reported that over 60 rallies were held in 40 different areas throughout the day . <unk> and Al Jazeera English estimated the number of protests at 60 and reported they were mostly peaceful . Al @-@ Mahafdha of BCHR reported that authorities arrested 20 protesters , including 5 women and a minor . He said protests turnout was in thousands " despite the campaign of intimidation and surrounding villages with barbed wire " . The MoI said the woman driver who was arrested with her companions tried to " run over a policeman at a road block " . The MoI added they arrested 20 individuals , among them 8 fugitives . Al Wefaq reported that the number of the arrested was 23 and that 4 were released later . Some injuries were reported in Karzakan and <unk> by the <unk> . BCHR said 10 were injured by tear gas ( inhalation ) and birdshot , while Al Wefaq said 2 people were in a critical condition . 
 The BCHR accused the government of using " large amounts of tear gas ... to disperse anyone gathering on the streets " . " [ I ] t has been very difficult for protesters to move from their villages onto the main streets because of the barbed wires that were set up last night , " al @-@ Khawaja said . The BCHR also accused the government of dispatching mercenaries from Pakistan and Jordan to aid security forces in the crackdown , however an opposition figure said this claim was hard to prove , because security forces wear masks . The Associated Press and AFP reported that the heavy deployment of security forces have succeeded in preventing large @-@ scale protests in Manama , instead protesters were confined to neighborhoods around the city . 
 Al Wefaq released a statement accusing authorities of cutting Internet connection in a number of areas . " Personal devices of some citizens have also been selectively cut off , " the statement added . The secular @-@ leftist Waad society said that instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp had been blocked by <unk> Bahrain telecommunications company . Several citizens also complained of loss of Internet for several hours in different locations during the day . They said the cut was at a time when protests were being held . Previously in February 2011 , when the uprising began , a similar situation occurred during which the Internet became either slow or was lost completely . Telecommunication companies said then that the problem was due an overload on Internet networks . 
 Reuters described the protests as " an upsurge of a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year @-@ old campaign " . It reported that the morning saw protests end peacefully , while in the evening clashes between protesters and police occurred . Bahrainis in London organized a small , but vocal protest starting from the Bahraini embassy to Downing Street . Protesters criticized the United Kingdom over continuing to sign arms trades to Bahrain , despite human rights violations . " Instead of challenging Bahrain on human rights record our government is supporting it and it 's a disgrace , " said one protester .

 In the morning of 15 August , protesters blocked several main streets and in the afternoon they clashed with police after holding sit @-@ ins in a number of villages , in response to a call by February 14 Youth Coalition , the Bahrain Mirror reported . Tamarod had planned protests in Manama on 16 August , including a " car demonstration " , however few hours before the start time , they cancelled the event . Security forces had been heavily deployed in Manama in anticipation of the protests . Tamarod said that by playing out this tactic , they " controlled the distribution and actions of security forces " . 
 Hundreds of protesters in several Shia villages took to the street at night following a call by February 14 Youth Coalition . They called for the overthrow of the monarchy and chanted " Down with [ King ] Hamad " , before clashes erupted with security forces . Police fired " buckshot , tear gas , and sound grenades " in response to protesters throwing stones and molotov cocktails at them . Al @-@ Mahafdha said protests were held in Manama , Al Daih and <unk> among other places and that there were no reported injuries . The MoI reported arresting members of a " terrorist group " in the village of Bani Jamra , west of Manama . Witnesses from Bani Jamra said detainees were severely beaten before arrest and that one of them with sickle @-@ cell anemia was taken by an ambulance .

 Spokesperson of Tamarod , Hussain Yousif lauded protesters response and called for further protests on Thursday and Friday , and said they planned to organize further protests in the weeks to come . " Many responded to the calls to come out and protest today ... The government has converted Bahrain into a military base trying to isolate the villages to prevent people from reaching protest sites , " he added . Ali Salman of Al Wefaq praised Tamarod protests , saying they scored more success than expected by drawing media attention and maintaining peacefulness . He also expressed his relief about the small number of casualties and the lack of deaths . Human Rights First ( HRF ) criticized the government of Bahrain response to protests , which they said reflected the " increasing levels of frustration felt by many in Bahrain at the lack of any real reform " . " What happened today confirmed fears that the government of Bahrain is determined to crush any form of dissent , " said Brian J. Dooley of HRF . 
 The BNA downplayed the effect of the protests , saying it was " business as usual " in the country . " Bahrainis and expatriates reported to work on Wednesday just like any other day , defying calls by radical opposition groups of road blockades and attack on properties , " the state @-@ run agency added . Critics said the protests failed as most streets were empty and protests disorganized . Abdulla Al Junaid of the pro @-@ government National Union Gathering said an opposition cleric criticized Tamarod as a " stillborn " . The United States expressed its concern at the possibility of violence . " We remain very concerned about continuing incidents of violence in Bahrain and , of course , the possibility for violence and would urge all parties to strongly condemn violence and contribute to fostering a climate of dialogue and reconciliation , " said the spokesperson of State Department . The spokesperson added that they " support [ ed ] the right of individuals to peacefully assemble and of course , the right of freedom of expression , including in Bahrain " .

 Prior to the protests , HRF said they were " likely to be the most significant in over a year " . Saeed al @-@ Shehabi of the London @-@ based Bahrain Freedom Movement said the Tamarod movement would " renew Bahrain 's forgotten revolution " . Mansoor al @-@ Jamri , editor of Al @-@ Wasat independent newspaper expressed pessimism about the situation , saying that " it 's a very volatile situation . We might be heading for a very harsh period . " Marc Jones was also pessimistic . " It is unlikely that these ' <unk> ' protests will amount to anything , especially as the Bahraini authorities have spent the past two years breaking the back of the opposition movement . In 2011 , thousands were arrested , tens killed , and dozens tortured , " he said . Ashley Lindsey of Stratfor global intelligence firm said the likelihood of protests reaching Manama was low due to the experience of security forces . 
 Writing for RT , Afshin <unk> speculated that if 14 August protests are met with state violence , then it could be one of the last times Bahraini activists use peaceful means to seek democratic change and that other methods could include an armed struggle in the same way the anti @-@ apartheid movement led by Nelson Mandela deployed armed tactics after peaceful protests failed to bring about change . Jean <unk> wrote in the World Socialist Web Site that the concurrent timing of crackdown in Bahrain and Egypt was not a coincidence and that evidence showed it was coordinated by the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf . 
 Ken Hanly wrote that the political violence in Egypt " will no doubt overshadow whatever repressive measures are taken against protests in Bahrain " . Ala 'a Shehabi wrote in the Foreign Policy that the choice of Independence Day by Tamarod should be understood as an attempt to gain true full sovereignty as opposed to Stephen D. Krasner 's Organized Hypocrisy ( 1999 ) : " the paradox that though there is an informal understanding that states are sovereign , they can still be subject to constant intervention " . Jane Kinninmont of Chatham House said Tamarod protests would not succeed to replicate the Egyptian scenario " because the army in Bahrain doesn 't play the same role , and many of the security services don ’ t include Shi 'ite Bahrainis , so you don ’ t get that same sense of solidarity " . Matar Matar of Al Wefaq said that even if thousands had participated in Tamarod protests , the situation would remain the same as long as the United States continued to support what he called an " authoritarian regime " in Bahrain . 
 Writing for the Gulf News Hasan Tariq Al Hasan argued that Tamarod protests on 14 August had failed to live up to the expectations . He said that one of the main reasons was conflicting instructions between Bahrain Rebellion Movement and February 14 Youth Coalition , which launched its own Tamarod protest under the title " Tamarod Storm " . Ala 'a Shehabi said the security measures had made it " physically impossible " for big numbers to gather in one place . In an opinion column in Al @-@ Wasat , Jameel al @-@ Mahari said it was not appropriate to speak about failure or success of the protests , instead he argued that Bahrain 's real success was when the unrest ended , " when everyone listens to the voice of reason , when we reach compatible solutions , when the national cohesion is restored and when people feel they are equal before law and that they all are first class citizens .

 = Georgia Tech traditions = 
 Numerous Georgia Tech legends and traditions have been established since the school 's opening in 1888 , some of which have persisted for decades . Over time , the school has grown from a trade school into a large research university , and the traditions reflect that heritage . One of the cherished holdovers from Tech 's early years , a steam whistle blows five minutes before the hour , every hour from 7 : 55 am to 5 : 55 pm . On Tuesdays and Thursdays , it also blows at twenty @-@ five minutes after the hour . It 's for this reason that the faculty newspaper is named The Whistle . 
 Some of the traditions are well @-@ known , the most notable being the now @-@ banned tradition of stealing the " T " from Tech Tower . Tech Tower , Tech 's historic primary administrative building , has the letters TECH hanging atop it on each of its four sides . A number of times , students have orchestrated complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T , and on occasion have carried this act out successfully . One especially well @-@ known tradition that has existed nearly since the school 's establishment is Clean , Old @-@ Fashioned Hate , Georgia Tech 's heated , long @-@ standing and ongoing rivalry with the University of Georgia . The first known hostilities between the two schools trace back to 1891 . 
 Several legends originated at Georgia Tech . George P. Burdell , Tech 's ever @-@ present fictional student , was created in 1927 when a student filled out two application forms . Burdell went on to lead a long life ; he earned several degrees , fought in World War II , and almost won Time 's 2001 Person of the Year award . Georgia Tech is also known for the largest margin of victory in a football game , achieved in their 222 @-@ 0 thrashing of Cumberland University in the 1916 Cumberland vs. Georgia Tech football game .

 = = = Stealing the T = = = 
 Tech 's historic and primary administrative building , Tech Tower , has the letters TECH hanging atop it on each of its four sides . Since 1969 , students on several occasions have orchestrated complex plans to scale Tech Tower and steal the huge symbolic letter T off the building . The ' T ' was first stolen in April 1969 by a secret group of Georgia Tech students calling themselves the " Magnificent Seven . " The students , who were inspired by a similar prank that had taken place in 1968 at Harvard University , planned the theft as a means of commemorating Institute President Edwin D. Harrison 's retirement . The ' T ' was returned several days later via helicopter at the behest of Atlanta mayor Ivan Allen . 
 Following successful thefts , the T would then be returned at the halftime of the homecoming football game or would be returned to the lawn of the president 's mansion , and the student 's achievement would be celebrated . Tradition dictates that the first T to be stolen should be the one facing east , as this can most easily be seen from the I @-@ 75 / I @-@ 85 Downtown Connector . Although the administration used to turn a blind eye to this practice , it is now officially discouraged , due to the risk of fatal falls and the potential for damage to the building , and equated to criminal activity ( trespassing and theft ) . In recent years , this has become a serious offense , and perpetrators today would face a hefty fine to repair damages done to the building and a minimum of a semester @-@ long suspension for attempting the feat , if not outright expulsion . 
 Security features such as security cameras , pressure sensitive roof tiling , and fiber optic cabling running throughout the letters have been added to the T to help prevent its theft and aid in catching the perpetrators . In 1999 , the T was successfully stolen by a group of " six or seven people " on the morning of June 3 . The location of that T is still unknown . In 2001 , two members of the fraternity Beta Theta Pi were caught and suspended in an attempt to steal the T. In October 2005 , a replica of the T was stolen from the Student Services Building and returned two days later . Despite the lack of physical danger involved in stealing the spare T , the theft was still strongly criticized . The most recent successful theft of the T occurred during Georgia Tech 's spring break on March 18 , 2014 , which was the first time since 1999 that it had been successfully stolen . 
 = = = Ramblin ' Wreck = = = 
 The term Ramblin ' Wreck from Georgia Tech refers to either current students or alumni , the school mascot , or the various sports teams . Georgia Tech alumni , working on the construction of the Panama Canal , were called Ramblin ' Wrecks for the ingenious machines that they devised to transport themselves in and out of the jungles of Panama . These devices and their creators were nicknamed Ramblin ' Wrecks from Georgia Tech . Since then the term Ramblin ' Wreck has been applied to a graduate or current student of Georgia Tech . The actual Ramblin ' Wreck is a 1930 Ford Model A Sports Coupe first acquired by then @-@ associate dean of students James E. Dull , in 1961 . The first Ramblin ' Wreck mascot reference was in 1926 to Dean Floyd Field 's 1914 Ford Model T. Sports teams of Georgia Tech are also called the Ramblin ' Wreck . The fight song for Georgia Tech I 'm a Rambling Wreck begins with the lyrics , " I 'm a Ramblin ' Wreck from Georgia Tech and a hell of an engineer . " The song is sung at sporting events , official school functions , and always at the end of every graduation ceremony . 
 = = = The Whistle = = = 
 A steam whistle that blows five minutes before the hour , every hour . This tradition is a hold over from the trade school days , originally used to mark the end of a shift in the shops ; now it is used both to mark the end of classes and as a ten @-@ minute warning to the beginning of the next classes . It is also blown when Georgia Tech 's football team scores a touchdown or wins a game , and at each spring 's " When the Whistle Blows " remembrance ceremony . 
 Although not as popular as " stealing the T , " the whistle has been stolen several times . The first ever Tech whistle installed in the late 1890s was stolen in 1902 . The whistle was returned to Dean Griffin in 1949 as a retirement gift . The second theft of the whistle occurred in 1963 , when a group of students nicknamed the " Magnificent 7 " stole the whistle . Fearing Institute repercussions , the group returned the whistle in the spring of 1964 . The whistle was again stolen in 1978 by a group nicknamed the " Committee of Five " . The whistle was also stolen in 1969 and 1997 . Both times the whistle was returned almost immediately after its theft . In 1969 , the whistle was given to the student body president as a graduation gift a month after its theft and the 1997 theft was solved when President Clough found the whistle on his lawn a day after its theft . 
 The current steam whistle , located near Tech Tower , was built by the GTRI Machine Shop and installed in 2004 . The Faculty newspaper is also named The Whistle . 
 = = = To Hell With Georgia = = = 
 Georgia Tech has an ongoing rivalry with the University of Georgia , often simply called " georgia " for short . The rivalry was called Clean , Old @-@ Fashioned Hate by Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution columnist and UGA supporter , Lewis Grizzard . An annual issue of the Institute newspaper , The Technique , focuses on this rivalry with an issue that spoofs The Red and Black , the newspaper of the University of Georgia . As a dig at the rival school , the Technique will typically refer to it as " the University ( sic ) of Georgia " ( sometimes shortened to " U ( sic ) GA " ) in articles . " To Hell With Georgia " ( abbreviated " <unk> " or " <unk> " or " <unk> " ) is also known as " The Good Word . " In 2009 , the Georgia Tech Cable Network ( GTCN ) , produced a show , about the history of Clean , Old @-@ Fashioned Hate ' To Hell With Georgia ' . If one student asks the word from another ( " What 's the Good Word ? " ) , the response is always " To Hell with Georgia ! " If asked about the Bulldogs ( " How ' bout them Dawgs ? " ) , an old tagline from the " University of Georgia " expression , the correct answer is , " Piss on ' em ! " 
 = = = RAT Caps = = = 
 Every year , a number of freshmen , most notably those in the marching band , wear gold caps known as RAT caps at each football game . RAT is short for Recruit At Tech , although recently the Student Government has begun incorrectly using ' Recently Acquired Tech Students ' or ' Recently Acquired Techie . ' The RAT caps are decorated with the football team 's scores , the freshman 's name , hometown , major , expected graduation date , and " To HELL With georgia " emblazoned on the back of the cap . It is important that ' HELL ' should be in all capital letters , while ' georgia ' should be all lowercase . Students who intend to utilize the cooperative education program circle the top button on the cap , and fill it in once they have completed their involvement . 
 The tradition began in 1915 , and freshmen were required to wear the RAT caps every day until the Thanksgiving weekend game with UGA ( if Georgia Tech won ) or until end of the school year ( if Georgia Tech lost ) . If Tech did not play UGA that year , freshmen were allowed to stop wearing their caps after a homecoming game victory . If the team lost , then the previously stated rules applied . Freshmen caught not wearing the cap faced varying degrees of hazing , including having their hair shaved into the shape of a letter tee ( " T " ) or a T @-@ Cut . Anti @-@ hazing laws in the 1960s led to the virtual elimination of the tradition , although the use of RAT caps is still actively maintained by the marching band . 
 The RAT rules enforced by upperclassmen and in particular the Ramblin ' Reck Club are presented in the July 17 , 1964 edition of the Technique . The rules are listed below : 
 A Georgia Tech RAT ... 
 1 . Will wear a " RAT " cap with proper inscription at all times . It is not mandatory that the " RAT " cap be worn on Sundays . 
 2 . Will know the school songs - Ramblin ' Wreck , Alma Mater , White & Gold , and all cheers . 
 3 . Will attend and participate in all " RAT " sings . 
 4 . Will speak to everyone - a <unk> is proud of his association with his school and fellow students . 
 5 . Will not enter the campus post office between 9 : 45 and 10 : 15 A.M. on school days . 
 6 . Will not wear high school letters or emblems on the campus .
