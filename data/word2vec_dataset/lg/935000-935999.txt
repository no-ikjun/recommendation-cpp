 Upon public release , Rebirth 's design became a " target for ridicule " . In June 2011 , Milwaukie neighborhood association leaders sent a letter to the Public Art Advisory Committee expressing their disappointment with the proposed deer concept , hoping to see changes to its final design . Some residents thought the sculpture should be more accessible and less expensive ; conversely , the Oak Lodge Community Council chairwoman , who also served as a member of the art committee , hoped the sculpture could serve as a community space and reach " icon " status . In a formal letter , TriMet 's general manager responded to the neighborhood associations by encouraging residents to " communicate directly with the art committee by inviting members to neighborhood association leadership meetings " . The agency 's spokeswoman also told committee leaders that the public was welcome to share their preferences regarding the work 's dimensions , fabrication methods , form , and materials . Oak Grove and Milwaukie residents also disagreed about whether or not those in the latter city had a say about the sculpture , which would have been within the area 's boundaries according to the first design . 
 In October 2011 , at a public meeting to address TriMet 's projected budget gap , one Milwaukie resident asked the agency to abandon its plans to fund Rebirth , saying that " a lot of people think that thing 's just ugly . Why are they spending money on something that 's an unnecessary add @-@ on at the same time they 're talking about cutting bus routes again ? " The agency 's general manager responded that all possibilities would be considered , though TriMet officials confirmed that cuts to its public art program were not an option and the MAX Orange Line 's budget was separate from TriMet 's financial problems . 
 In November 2011 , TriMet 's public art coordinator confirmed Alavi 's withdrawal from the project , saying , " The artist for Park ( Avenue ) did his due diligence . He did everything possible to make that a reality , but sometimes it 's not realistic . " According to The Oregonian , Alavi was unable to meet the Public Art Advisory Committee 's technical requirements and remain under budget . One committee member admitted , " The form itself was something a lot of people out in the community weren 't happy with in the first place , so once the mosaic piece was taken away , it kind of devalued it . " Alavi released the following statement : 
 In honor of the death of the " Deer Baby / Twilight Zone Bambi " , I thought a quote by Rod Serling , might be appropriate ... 
 " For the record , prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy ; and a thoughtless , frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all of its own for the children , and the children yet unborn . And the pity of it is , that these things cannot be confined to the Twilight Zone . " 
 From The Twilight Zone episode , " The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street " , March 6 , 1960 
 Thanks , 
 Seyed Alavi 
 The debate over the sculpture 's proposed design by TriMet , the art committee , and members of the public reached " near @-@ yelling match " status , resulting in " animosity and general nastiness " . Following Alavi 's withdrawal , the art committee made plans to reconvene and consider other design proposals for the site . 
 = = Critical response = = 
 In articles providing updates about the sculpture 's status , The Oregonian called the work " larger @-@ than @-@ life style highway art " and " Twilight Zone Bambi " . Angela Webber of the Daily Journal of Commerce expressed her love for the sculpture and disappointment in the public 's reaction . She wrote , " This makes me so sad . [ ... ] Apparently , this giant baby @-@ faced deer statue isn 't pretty enough for Milwaukie . [ ... ] I imagine the folks of Milwaukie just don 't get it . " 
 Following confirmation about the artist 's withdrawal , the journal 's Aaron Spencer said local residents are being deprived of the sculpture 's " disturbing fantastical whimsy " . In an article called " Let 's save the giant baby @-@ faced deer statue ! " , he wrote : " As we all know , I love this statue . I love it a lot . And I think we can save it . There are lots of places in Portland that could use some beautification , and a little public art can go a long way . " Spencer and a colleague compiled a gallery of images created using Adobe Photoshop to illustrate the sculpture 's potential . 
 = Patient X ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Patient X " is the thirteenth episode of the fifth season of American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It was written by series creator Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz , directed by Kim Manners and aired in the United States on March 1 , 1998 on the Fox network . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 12 @.@ 6 , being watched by 20 @.@ 21 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received moderately positive reviews from critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , as a rebel alien race secretly attacks several groups of former alien abductees , the agents meet Cassandra Spender ( Veronica Cartwright ) , a woman who claims to be a multiple abductee and wants to deliver a positive message about aliens . Agent Mulder , now skeptical about extraterrestrial activity , is disturbed when Agent Scully forms a special bond with the woman . 
 " Patient X " was a story milestone for the series . It introduced several new recurring characters for the series . It was the first episode to feature Chris Owens as Jeffrey Spender and Veronica Cartwright as Cassandra Spender . It is the first of a two @-@ part story that concludes with the following episode , " The Red and the Black " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Kazakhstan , two young boys see an unknown object fall from the sky . Seconds later , they witness a man being burned alive and are captured by an Alien Bounty Hunter who has his eyes and mouth sewn shut . The next day , Marita Covarrubias ( Laurie Holden ) leads an investigation of U.N. troops of the area . She runs into Alex Krycek ( Nicholas Lea ) , who has caught Dimitri , one of the Kazakh boys . Krycek tells Marita to tell her superiors that " it is all going to hell " . 
 Meanwhile , Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) attends a lecture at MIT , where the testimony of Cassandra Spender ( Veronica Cartwright ) , an alien abductee , is being presented . Mulder argues against other members of the lecture over the existence of alien life , claiming that it is a lie created to cover up a program of medical experimentation on civilians run by the military industrial complex . When the lecture ends , Mulder is met by Dr. Heitz Werber , who is surprised to see that Mulder has lost his belief in alien life since the last time they met . Werber tells Mulder that he is Cassandra 's doctor , and asks him to visit her . 
 Meanwhile , Krycek , who has beaten Dmitri into telling him what he saw , orders his Russian colleagues to infect him with the black oil . Back in the United States , Werber introduces Mulder to the wheelchair @-@ bound Cassandra , who considers him a hero of hers . She claims that the aliens are in a state of upheaval and that she will be abducted by them again . Mulder tells Cassandra there is nothing he can do for her and leaves . 
 In Russia , Krycek , working against the orders of his superiors , kidnaps the infected Dmitri and flees to the U.S. , sewing shut the boy 's eyes , nose , and mouth to keep the black oil from leaving his body . At FBI headquarters , Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) meets Agent Jeffrey Spender ( Chris Owens ) , Cassandra 's son , who fears the damage to his reputation if his colleagues learn about his mother . He tells Scully to keep Mulder away from her . 
 Marita reports to the Syndicate , which expected colonization at a much later date . Krycek offers Dmitri to the Syndicate in exchange for all their research on a vaccine . Meanwhile , Scully talks to Mulder about his meeting with Cassandra . She realizes that she has much in common with Cassandra , including being abducted at Skyland Mountain and having an implant inserted in the base of her neck . Scully visits Cassandra , who immediately realizes that she 's a fellow abductee . Scully tells her not to remove the implant . Cassandra assures Scully that she never will , as she looks forward to being abducted again . 
 A group of abductees meet at Skyland Mountain and are burned alive by more faceless Alien Bounty Hunters . Scully and Mulder visit the scene , with Mulder continuing to be very skeptical of any alien involvement . The Syndicate is shocked by the massacre . Mulder and Scully visit Cassandra again , who knew many of the people who died . They encounter Spender , who is upset about their visit with his mother . Krycek is met by Marita . When Krycek returns to the cell where Dmitri is held , he finds him gone , and the Well @-@ Manicured Man there instead . 
 Scully finds that the victims of the attack had implants in their necks and all claimed to be abductees . Mulder believes they were led there by the military , not aliens . Mulder is called by Marita , who kidnapped Dmitri . Dmitri pulls the stitches off his eyes , resulting in Marita getting infected with the black oil . Mulder calls Cassandra , looking for Scully , but Jeffrey answers and reveals that Cassandra is gone . At that moment Cassandra is with a group of abductees , including Scully , at the Ruskin Dam , brought there by Syndicate assassin Quiet Willy . The abductees see a UFO appear in the sky . Suddenly screams are uttered as two faceless aliens arrive .

 This episode marks the first appearance of Chris Owens as Jeffrey Spender . Owens previously appeared in earlier episodes , the first being " Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man " , in which he played the younger version of The Smoking Man . Owens later reprised this role in episode " Demons " . During the fifth season of the show , Owen was cast to play the part of The Great Mutato in " The Post @-@ Modern Prometheus " . After his stint on The X @-@ Files , Owens attempted to get a job as a waiter in Vancouver , to no avail . One day , however , he ran into series creator Chris Carter at a bar , who humorously told him , " I didn 't know they served guys with two faces here " , a reference to his portrayal of The Great Mutato . Carter explained that David Duchovny had " taken careful notice " of Owens acting abilities and requested that he return to the series in some capacity . Heeding Duchovny 's advice , Carter created the role of Jeffrey Spender just for him . In addition , the episode was the first to introduce the recurring character of Cassandra Spender , played by Veronica Cartwright . Rick Millikan , the series ' casting director , was very pleased with Cartwright 's performance , noting , " She 's got a voice that adds a little creepiness and a little mystery that I thought played really well . She was just the perfect X @-@ Files person . " " Patient X " was the first episode in which Nicholas Lea was credited under the Also Starring tag , alongside Mitch Pileggi and William B. Davis . 
 The Russian characters from the start of the episode came from a " great " Russian acting community in Vancouver , British Columbia who had defected from the Soviet Union . Both Lea and Laurie Holden were required to learn Russian for the first scene following the opening credits . Alex Shostak Jr . , who portrayed Dmitri , worked 12 – 14 hours a day ; make @-@ up was applied to give the appearance that his eyes and mouth had been sewed up , and a small straw was pushed between his lips to give him water . During the filming of the episode , he was " literally " blind and guided by the crew members throughout the filming of his scenes . Shostak provided the translation for his own lines from English to Russian . Holden and Lea worked diligently together to perfect their lines in Russian . Holden explained , " we 'd come up with these fun ways to test ourselves to know if we had really nailed it . Show tunes come to mind , but I also remember this one time my dialect coach had me call a Russian friend of his on his cell phone to see if he could understand me . I passed the test . " 
 = = = Filming and visual effects = = = 
 Filming the scene with the burning camp was " tricky " , according to Kim Manners . When they were filming the scene , they had huge " safety precautions " ready for the cast and crew . The fires seen in the episode , were in reality propane fires . Manners wanted the shots to be as close to the fire as possible , so they used fireproof cameras . According to Manners , " they used a half a million dollar camera on a crane wrapped in asbestos " and ran it through the flames . For the following scene , the production crew set a man on fire , while using a fire suit . This stunt is known as a " full burn . " Scenes like this are " very dangerous " as one can 't breathe . In total , he was on fire between 25 – 30 seconds , which is seen as a lot by filming standards . Special effects supervisor Tony Lindala supervised the creation of the faceless alien rebels , Dmitri 's mutilation , and the incinerated victims of the rebels . Lindala also designed the rig used to infect Dmitri with the black oil . 
 The set for the Russian gulag was built at North Shore Studios . Graeme Murray was the production designer at the time . The following scene with Dmitri in the gulag was " difficult . " The ship scenes were filmed at a warehouse in Vancouver . When filming the Syndicate meeting , Manners wanted Marita Covarrubias to look as strong as possible since this marked the first appearance of a woman in the Syndicate meeting room . Since there was very little movement among the actors when filming the scene , they were forced to film in different angles and wide shots .

 " Patient X " premiered in the United States on the Fox network on March 1 , 1998 . This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 12 @.@ 6 , with a 19 share , meaning that roughly 12 @.@ 6 percent of all television @-@ equipped households , and 19 percent of households watching television , were tuned in to the episode . It was viewed by 20 @.@ 21 million viewers . Veronica Cartwright was nominated in the category " Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series " in the 1998 Emmy Awards for her performance in this episode and its follow @-@ up , " The Red and the Black " . The episode was later included on The X @-@ Files Mythology , Volume 3 – Colonization , a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien Colonist 's plans to take over the earth . 
 Critical reception to the episode was largely positive . Television Without Pity ranked " Patient X " the eighth most nightmare @-@ inducing episode of the show , citing , in particular the abuse of Dmitri . The article noted that " If The X @-@ Files has taught us anything , it ’ s that if a G @-@ Man asks us if we know anything about anything and we foolishly say yes , our mouths and eyelids will be sewn shut and we will be brainwashed to kill on demand . " The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave " Patient X " a B + , and wrote that the episode " feels epic , in a way the mythology episodes do at their best " . However , VanDerWerff noted that " The problem with breaking the status quo on a TV series is that your audience is always going to know in the back of its head that the status quo isn ’ t really broken . " He reasoned that the audience never fully believed that " Mulder could lose his belief in the all @-@ consuming alien conspiracy " or accept the idea that " Scully could find herself dabbling with belief in [ aliens ] . " Despite these set @-@ backs , however , he noted that " Patient X " was the episode where the series ' mythology " gets moving again , after chasing its own tail throughout much of season four and reaching a sort of climax in the opening episodes of season five . " Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode four stars out of five . The two described the tone of " Patient X " as " truly visceral " , citing the faceless men incinerating people as well as the mutilation of the innocent Dmitri , who was " at the wrong place at the wrong time " . Furthermore , Shearman and Pearson praised the episode for " shift [ ing ] the goalposts " and allowing Mulder and Scully to switch roles as the believer and skeptic . Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . Vitaris praised the episode 's premise and writing . " ' Patient X ' is a rare episode in that it actually advances The X @-@ Files mythology , with the news of a vaccine to combat the black oil " . However , she was critical of the episode 's reliance on shock value , noting that the " camera seems to take a perverse delight in death , pain , and mutilation , with the distressing effect of numbing the viewer to the horror .

 = Comet = 
 A comet is an icy small Solar System body that , when passing close to the Sun , heats up and begins to outgas , displaying a visible atmosphere or coma , and sometimes also a tail . These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind upon the nucleus of the comet . Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice , dust , and small rocky particles . The coma and tail are much larger and , if sufficiently bright , may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope . Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures . 
 Comets usually have highly eccentric elliptical orbits , and they have a wide range of orbital periods , ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years . Short @-@ period comets originate in the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc , which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune . Long @-@ period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud , a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the next nearest star . Long @-@ period comets are directed towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide . Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung out to interstellar space . 
 Comets are distinguished from asteroids by the presence of an extended , gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus . This atmosphere has parts termed the coma ( the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus ) and the tail ( a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from the coma by the Sun 's light pressure or <unk> solar wind plasma ) . However , extinct comets that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their volatile ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids . Asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets , having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer Solar System . The discovery of main @-@ belt comets and active centaurs has blurred the distinction between asteroids and comets . 
 As of November 2014 there are 5 @,@ 253 known comets , a number that is steadily increasing . However , this represents only a tiny fraction of the total potential comet population , as the reservoir of comet @-@ like bodies in the outer Solar System ( in the Oort cloud ) is estimated to be one trillion . Roughly one comet per year is visible to the naked eye , though many of these are faint and unspectacular . Particularly bright examples are called " Great Comets " . Comets have been visited by unmanned probes such as the European Space Agency 's Rosetta , which became the first ever to land a robotic spacecraft on a comet , and NASA 's Deep Impact , which blasted a crater on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word comet derives from the Old English <unk> from the Latin <unk> or <unk> . That , in turn , is a latinisation of the Greek <unk> ( " wearing long hair " ) , and the Oxford English Dictionary notes that the term ( <unk> ) <unk> already meant " long @-@ haired star , comet " in Greek . <unk> was derived from <unk> ( " to wear the hair long " ) , which was itself derived from <unk> ( " the hair of the head " ) and was used to mean " the tail of a comet " . 
 The astronomical symbol for comets is <unk> , consisting of a small disc with three hairlike extensions . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 = = = Nucleus = = = 
 The solid , core structure of a comet is known as the nucleus . Cometary nuclei are composed of an amalgamation of rock , dust , water ice , and frozen gases such as carbon dioxide , carbon monoxide , methane , and ammonia . As such , they are popularly described as " dirty snowballs " after Fred Whipple 's model . However , some comets may have a higher dust content , leading them to be called " icy <unk> " . Research conducted in 2014 suggests that comets are like " deep fried ice cream " , in that their surfaces are formed of dense crystalline ice mixed with organic compounds , while the interior ice is colder and less dense . 
 The surface of the nucleus is generally dry , dusty or rocky , suggesting that the ices are hidden beneath a surface crust several metres thick . In addition to the gases already mentioned , the nuclei contain a variety of organic compounds , which may include methanol , hydrogen cyanide , formaldehyde , ethanol , and ethane and perhaps more complex molecules such as long @-@ chain hydrocarbons and amino acids . In 2009 , it was confirmed that the amino acid glycine had been found in the comet dust recovered by NASA 's Stardust mission . In August 2011 , a report , based on NASA studies of meteorites found on Earth , was published suggesting DNA and RNA components ( adenine , guanine , and related organic molecules ) may have been formed on asteroids and comets . 
 The outer surfaces of cometary nuclei have a very low albedo , making them among the least reflective objects found in the Solar System . The Giotto space probe found that the nucleus of Halley 's Comet reflects about four percent of the light that falls on it , and Deep Space 1 discovered that Comet Borrelly 's surface reflects less than 3 @.@ 0 % of the light that falls on it ; by comparison , asphalt reflects seven percent of the light that falls on it . The dark surface material of the nucleus may consist of complex organic compounds . Solar heating drives off lighter volatile compounds , leaving behind larger organic compounds that tend to be very dark , like tar or crude oil . The low reflectivity of cometary surfaces enables them to absorb the heat necessary to drive their outgassing processes . 
 Comet nuclei with radii of up to 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) have been observed , but ascertaining their exact size is difficult . The nucleus of <unk> / SOHO is probably only 100 – 200 metres ( 330 – 660 ft ) in diameter . A lack of smaller comets being detected despite the increased sensitivity of instruments has led some to suggest that there is a real lack of comets smaller than 100 metres ( 330 ft ) across . Known comets have been estimated to have an average density of 0 @.@ 6 g / cm3 ( 0 @.@ 35 oz / cu in ) . Because of their low mass , comet nuclei do not become spherical under their own gravity and therefore have irregular shapes . 
 Roughly six percent of the near @-@ Earth asteroids are thought to be extinct nuclei of comets that no longer experience outgassing , including <unk> Hypnos and <unk> Don Quixote . 
 Results from the Rosetta and Philae spacecraft show that the nucleus of 67P / Churyumov – Gerasimenko has no magnetic field , which suggests that magnetism may not have played a role in the early formation of planetesimals . Further , the ALICE spectrograph on Rosetta determined that electrons ( within 1 km ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) above the comet nucleus ) produced from photoionization of water molecules by solar radiation , and not photons from the Sun as thought earlier , are responsible for the degradation of water and carbon dioxide molecules released from the comet nucleus into its coma . Instruments on the Philae lander found at least sixteen organic compounds at the comet 's surface , four of which ( acetamide , acetone , methyl isocyanate and <unk> ) have been detected for the first time on a comet . 
 = = = Coma = = = 
 The streams of dust and gas thus released form a huge and extremely thin atmosphere around the comet called the " coma " , and the force exerted on the coma by the Sun 's radiation pressure and solar wind cause an enormous " tail " to form pointing away from the Sun . 
 The coma is generally made of H2O and dust , with water making up to 90 % of the volatiles that outflow from the nucleus when the comet is within 3 to 4 astronomical units ( 450 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 to 600 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 km ; 280 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 to 370 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 mi ) of the Sun . The H2O parent molecule is destroyed primarily through photodissociation and to a much smaller extent photoionization , with the solar wind playing a minor role in the destruction of water compared to photochemistry . Larger dust particles are left along the comet 's orbital path whereas smaller particles are pushed away from the Sun into the comet 's tail by light pressure . 
 Although the solid nucleus of comets is generally less than 60 kilometres ( 37 mi ) across , the coma may be thousands or millions of kilometres across , sometimes becoming larger than the Sun . For example , about a month after an outburst in October 2007 , comet 17P / Holmes briefly had a tenuous dust atmosphere larger than the Sun . The Great Comet of 1811 also had a coma roughly the diameter of the Sun . Even though the coma can become quite large , its size can decrease about the time it crosses the orbit of Mars around 1 @.@ 5 astronomical units ( 220 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 km ; 140 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 mi ) from the Sun . At this distance the solar wind becomes strong enough to blow the gas and dust away from the coma , enlarging the tail . Ion tails have been observed to extend one astronomical unit ( 150 million km ) or more . 
 Both the coma and tail are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible when a comet passes through the inner Solar System , the dust reflecting Sunlight directly and the gases glowing from ionisation . Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope , but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye . Occasionally a comet may experience a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust , during which the size of the coma greatly increases for a period of time . This happened in 2007 to Comet Holmes . 
 In 1996 , comets were found to emit X @-@ rays . This greatly surprised astronomers because X @-@ ray emission is usually associated with very high @-@ temperature bodies . The X @-@ rays are generated by the interaction between comets and the solar wind : when highly charged solar wind ions fly through a cometary atmosphere , they collide with cometary atoms and molecules , " stealing " one or more electrons from the atom in a process called " charge exchange " . This exchange or transfer of an electron to the solar wind ion is followed by its de @-@ excitation into the ground state of the ion , leading to the emission of X @-@ rays and far ultraviolet photons . 
 = = = Tails = = = 
 In the outer Solar System , comets remain frozen and inactive and are extremely difficult or impossible to detect from Earth due to their small size . Statistical detections of inactive comet nuclei in the Kuiper belt have been reported from observations by the Hubble Space Telescope but these detections have been questioned . As a comet approaches the inner Solar System , solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus , carrying dust away with them . 
 The streams of dust and gas each form their own distinct tail , pointing in slightly different directions . The tail of dust is left behind in the comet 's orbit in such a manner that it often forms a curved tail called the type II or dust tail . At the same time , the ion or type I tail , made of gases , always points directly away from the Sun because this gas is more strongly affected by the solar wind than is dust , following magnetic field lines rather than an orbital trajectory . On occasions - such as when the Earth passes through a comet 's orbital plane , and we see the track of the comet edge @-@ on , a tail pointing in the opposite direction to the ion and dust tails may be seen – the <unk> . 
 The observation of <unk> contributed significantly to the discovery of solar wind . The ion tail is formed as a result of the ionisation by solar ultra @-@ violet radiation of particles in the coma . Once the particles have been ionized , they attain a net positive electrical charge , which in turn gives rise to an " induced magnetosphere " around the comet . The comet and its induced magnetic field form an obstacle to outward flowing solar wind particles . Because the relative orbital speed of the comet and the solar wind is supersonic , a bow shock is formed upstream of the comet in the flow direction of the solar wind . In this bow shock , large concentrations of cometary ions ( called " pick @-@ up ions " ) congregate and act to " load " the solar magnetic field with plasma , such that the field lines " drape " around the comet forming the ion tail . 
 If the ion tail loading is sufficient , then the magnetic field lines are squeezed together to the point where , at some distance along the ion tail , magnetic reconnection occurs . This leads to a " tail disconnection event " . This has been observed on a number of occasions , one notable event being recorded on 20 April 2007 , when the ion tail of Encke 's Comet was completely severed while the comet passed through a coronal mass ejection . This event was observed by the <unk> space probe . 
 In 2013 ESA scientists reported that the ionosphere of the planet Venus streams outwards in a manner similar to the ion tail seen streaming from a comet under similar conditions . " 
 = = = Jets = = = 
 Uneven heating can cause newly generated gases to break out of a weak spot on the surface of comet 's nucleus , like a geyser . These streams of gas and dust can cause the nucleus to spin , and even split apart . In 2010 it was revealed dry ice ( frozen carbon dioxide ) can power jets of material flowing out of a comet nucleus . This is known because a spacecraft got so close that it could see where the jets were coming out , and then measure the infrared spectrum at that point which shows what some of the materials are . 
 = = Orbital characteristics = = 
 Most comets are small Solar System bodies with elongated elliptical orbits that take them close to the Sun for a part of their orbit and then out into the further reaches of the Solar System for the remainder . Comets are often classified according to the length of their orbital periods : The longer the period the more elongated the ellipse . 
 = = = Short period = = = 
 Periodic comets or short @-@ period comets are generally defined as having orbital periods of less than 200 years . They usually orbit more @-@ or @-@ less in the ecliptic plane in the same direction as the planets . Their orbits typically take them out to the region of the outer planets ( Jupiter and beyond ) at aphelion ; for example , the aphelion of Halley 's Comet is a little beyond the orbit of Neptune . Comets whose aphelia are near a major planet 's orbit are called its " family " . Such families are thought to arise from the planet capturing formerly long @-@ period comets into shorter orbits . 
 At the shorter extreme , Encke 's Comet has an orbit that does not reach the orbit of Jupiter , and is known as an Encke @-@ type comet . Short @-@ period comets with orbital periods shorter than 20 years and low inclinations ( up to 30 degrees ) are called Jupiter @-@ family comets ( JFCs ) . Those like Halley , with orbital periods of between 20 and 200 years and inclinations extending from zero to more than 90 degrees , are called Halley @-@ type comets ( <unk> ) . As of 2015 , only 75 <unk> have been observed , compared with 511 identified JFCs . 
 Recently discovered main @-@ belt comets form a distinct class , orbiting in more circular orbits within the asteroid belt . 
 Because their elliptical orbits frequently take them close to the giant planets , comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations . Short @-@ period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet 's semi @-@ major axis , with the JFCs being the largest group . It is clear that comets coming in from the Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets as a result of a close encounter . Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations , being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined . These perturbations can deflect long @-@ period comets into shorter orbital periods . 
 Based on their orbital characteristics , short @-@ period comets are thought to originate from the centaurs and the Kuiper belt / scattered disc — a disk of objects in the trans @-@ Neptunian region — whereas the source of long @-@ period comets is thought to be the far more distant spherical Oort cloud ( after the Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort who hypothesised its existence ) . Vast swarms of comet @-@ like bodies are thought to orbit the Sun in these distant regions in roughly circular orbits . Occasionally the gravitational influence of the outer planets ( in the case of Kuiper belt objects ) or nearby stars ( in the case of Oort cloud objects ) may throw one of these bodies into an elliptical orbit that takes it inwards toward the Sun to form a visible comet . Unlike the return of periodic comets , whose orbits have been established by previous observations , the appearance of new comets by this mechanism is unpredictable . 
 = = = Long period = = = 
 Long @-@ period comets have highly eccentric orbits and periods ranging from 200 years to thousands of years . An eccentricity greater than 1 when near perihelion does not necessarily mean that a comet will leave the Solar System . For example , Comet McNaught had a heliocentric osculating eccentricity of 1 @.@ <unk> near its perihelion passage epoch in January 2007 but is bound to the Sun with roughly a 92 @,@ 600 @-@ year orbit because the eccentricity drops below 1 as it moves further from the Sun . The future orbit of a long @-@ period comet is properly obtained when the osculating orbit is computed at an epoch after leaving the planetary region and is calculated with respect to the center of mass of the Solar System . By definition long @-@ period comets remain gravitationally bound to the Sun ; those comets that are ejected from the Solar System due to close passes by major planets are no longer properly considered as having " periods " . The orbits of long @-@ period comets take them far beyond the outer planets at aphelia , and the plane of their orbits need not lie near the ecliptic . Long @-@ period comets such as Comet West and C / 1999 F1 can have aphelion distances of nearly 70 @,@ 000 AU with orbital periods estimated around 6 million years . 
 Single @-@ apparition or non @-@ periodic comets are similar to long @-@ period comets because they also have parabolic or slightly hyperbolic trajectories when near perihelion in the inner Solar System . However , gravitational perturbations from giant planets cause their orbits to change . Single @-@ apparition comets have a hyperbolic or parabolic osculating orbit which allows them to permanently exit the Solar System after a single pass of the Sun . The Sun 's Hill sphere has an unstable maximum boundary of 230 @,@ 000 AU ( 1 @.@ 1 parsecs ( 3 @.@ 6 light @-@ years ) ) . Only a few hundred comets have been seen to reach a hyperbolic orbit ( e > 1 ) when near perihelion that using a heliocentric unperturbed two @-@ body best @-@ fit suggests they may escape the Solar System . 
 No comets with an eccentricity significantly greater than one have been observed , so there are no confirmed observations of comets that are likely to have originated outside the Solar System . Comet C / 1980 E1 had an orbital period of roughly 7 @.@ 1 million years before the 1982 perihelion passage , but a 1980 encounter with Jupiter accelerated the comet giving it the largest eccentricity ( 1 @.@ 057 ) of any known hyperbolic comet . Comets not expected to return to the inner Solar System include C / 1980 E1 , C / 2000 U5 , C / 2001 Q4 ( NEAT ) , C / 2009 R1 , C / 1956 R1 , and C / 2007 F1 ( <unk> ) . 
 Some authorities use the term " periodic comet " to refer to any comet with a periodic orbit ( that is , all short @-@ period comets plus all long @-@ period comets ) , whereas others use it to mean exclusively short @-@ period comets . Similarly , although the literal meaning of " non @-@ periodic comet " is the same as " single @-@ apparition comet " , some use it to mean all comets that are not " periodic " in the second sense ( that is , to also include all comets with a period greater than 200 years ) . 
 Early observations have revealed a few genuinely hyperbolic ( i.e. non @-@ periodic ) trajectories , but no more than could be accounted for by perturbations from Jupiter . If comets pervaded interstellar space , they would be moving with velocities of the same order as the relative velocities of stars near the Sun ( a few tens of km per second ) . If such objects entered the Solar System , they would have positive specific orbital energy and would be observed to have genuinely hyperbolic trajectories . A rough calculation shows that there might be four hyperbolic comets per century within Jupiter 's orbit , give or take one and perhaps two orders of magnitude . 
 = = = Oort cloud and Hills cloud = = = 
 The Oort cloud is thought to occupy a vast space from somewhere between 2 @,@ 000 and 5 @,@ 000 AU ( 0 @.@ 03 and 0 @.@ 08 ly ) to as far as 50 @,@ 000 AU ( 0 @.@ 79 ly ) from the Sun . Some estimates place the outer edge at between 100 @,@ 000 and 200 @,@ 000 AU ( 1 @.@ 58 and 3 @.@ 16 ly ) . The region can be subdivided into a spherical outer Oort cloud of 20 @,@ 000 – 50 @,@ 000 AU ( 0 @.@ 32 – 0 @.@ 79 ly ) , and a doughnut @-@ shaped inner Oort cloud of 2 @,@ 000 – 20 @,@ 000 AU ( 0 @.@ 03 – 0 @.@ 32 ly ) . The outer cloud is only weakly bound to the Sun and supplies the long @-@ period ( and possibly Halley @-@ type ) comets to inside the orbit of Neptune . The inner Oort cloud is also known as the Hills cloud , named after J. G. Hills , who proposed its existence in 1981 . Models predict that the inner cloud should have tens or hundreds of times as many cometary nuclei as the outer halo ; it is seen as a possible source of new comets to resupply the relatively tenuous outer cloud as the latter 's numbers are gradually depleted . The Hills cloud explains the continued existence of the Oort cloud after billions of years . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 <unk> beyond the Solar System have also been detected and may be common in the Milky Way . The first <unk> system detected was around Beta Pictoris , a very young A @-@ type main @-@ sequence star , in 1987 . A total of 10 such <unk> systems have been identified as of 2013 , using the absorption spectrum caused by the large clouds of gas emitted by comets when passing close to their star .

 = = = Connection to meteor showers = = = 
 As a result of outgassing , comets leave in their wake a trail of solid debris too large to be swept away by radiation pressure and the solar wind . If the comet 's path crosses the path the Earth follows in orbit around the Sun , then at that point there are likely to be meteor showers as Earth passes through the trail of debris . The <unk> meteor shower , for example , occurs every year between 9 and 13 August , when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift – Tuttle . Halley 's Comet is the source of the <unk> shower in October . 
 = = = Comets and impact on life = = = 
 Many comets and asteroids collided into Earth in its early stages . Many scientists think that comets bombarding the young Earth about 4 billion years ago brought the vast quantities of water that now fill the Earth 's oceans , or at least a significant portion of it . Other researchers have cast doubt on this idea . The detection of organic molecules , including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , in significant quantities in comets has led some to speculate that comets or meteorites may have brought the precursors of life — or even life itself — to Earth . In 2013 it was suggested that impacts between rocky and icy surfaces , such as comets , had the potential to create the amino acids that make up proteins through shock synthesis . In 2015 , scientists found significant amounts of molecular oxygen in <unk> from comet 67P , an indicator that presence of that molecule may occur naturally more often than it had been thought , and thus that it may not be as strong an indicator of alien life as has been supposed . 
 It is suspected that comet impacts have , over long timescales , also delivered significant quantities of water to the Earth 's Moon , some of which may have survived as lunar ice . Comet and meteoroid impacts are also thought to be responsible for the existence of tektites and <unk> .

 = = = Departure ( ejection ) from Solar System = = = 
 If a comet is traveling fast enough , it may leave the Solar System ; such is the case for hyperbolic comets . To date , comets are only known to be ejected by interacting with another object in the Solar System , such as Jupiter . An example of this is thought to be Comet C / 1980 E1 , which was shifted from a predicted orbit of 7 @.@ 1 million years around the Sun , to a hyperbolic trajectory , after a 1980 encounter with the planet Jupiter .

 Jupiter @-@ family comets and long @-@ period comets appear to follow very different fading laws . The JFCs are active over a lifetime of about 10 @,@ 000 years or ~ 1 @,@ 000 orbits whereas long @-@ period comets fade much faster . Only 10 % of the long @-@ period comets survive more than 50 passages to small perihelion and only 1 % of them survive more than 2 @,@ 000 passages . Eventually most of the volatile material contained in a comet nucleus evaporates away , and the comet becomes a small , dark , inert lump of rock or rubble that can resemble an asteroid . Some asteroids in elliptical orbits are now identified as extinct comets . Roughly six percent of the near @-@ Earth asteroids are thought to be extinct nuclei of comets that no longer emit gas . 
 = = = Breakup and collisions = = = 
 The nucleus of some comets may be fragile , a conclusion supported by the observation of comets splitting apart . A significant cometary disruption was that of Comet Shoemaker – Levy 9 , which was discovered in 1993 . A close encounter in July 1992 had broken it into pieces , and over a period of six days in July 1994 , these pieces fell into Jupiter 's atmosphere — the first time astronomers had observed a collision between two objects in the Solar System . Other splitting comets include 3D / Biela in 1846 and <unk> / <unk> – Wachmann from 1995 to 2006 . Greek historian Ephorus reported that a comet split apart as far back as the winter of 372 – 373 BC . Comets are suspected of splitting due to thermal stress , internal gas pressure , or impact . 
 Comets <unk> / <unk> and <unk> / Van <unk> appear to be fragments of a parent comet . Numerical integrations have shown that both comets had a rather close approach to Jupiter in January 1850 , and that , before 1850 , the two orbits were nearly identical . 
 Some comets have been observed to break up during their perihelion passage , including great comets West and Ikeya – Seki . Biela 's Comet was one significant example , when it broke into two pieces during its passage through the perihelion in 1846 . These two comets were seen separately in 1852 , but never again afterward . Instead , spectacular meteor showers were seen in 1872 and 1885 when the comet should have been visible . A minor meteor shower , the Andromedids , occurs annually in November , and it is caused when the Earth crosses the orbit of Biela 's Comet . 
 Some comets meet a more spectacular end – either falling into the Sun or smashing into a planet or other body . Collisions between comets and planets or moons were common in the early Solar System : some of the many craters on the Moon , for example , may have been caused by comets . A recent collision of a comet with a planet occurred in July 1994 when Comet Shoemaker – Levy 9 broke up into pieces and collided with Jupiter . 
 = = Nomenclature = = 
 The names given to comets have followed several different conventions over the past two centuries . Prior to the early 20th century , most comets were simply referred to by the year when they appeared , sometimes with additional adjectives for particularly bright comets ; thus , the " Great Comet of 1680 " , the " Great Comet of 1882 " , and the " Great January Comet of 1910 " . 
 After Edmund Halley demonstrated that the comets of 1531 , 1607 , and 1682 were the same body and successfully predicted its return in 1759 by calculating its orbit , that comet became known as Halley 's Comet . Similarly , the second and third known periodic comets , Encke 's Comet and Biela 's Comet , were named after the astronomers who calculated their orbits rather than their original discoverers . Later , periodic comets were usually named after their discoverers , but comets that had appeared only once continued to be referred to by the year of their apparition . 
 In the early 20th century , the convention of naming comets after their discoverers became common , and this remains so today . A comet can be named after its discoverers , or an instrument or program that helped to find it . 
 = = History of study = = 
 = = = Early observations and thought = = = 
 From ancient sources , such as Chinese oracle bones , it is known that their appearances have been noticed by humans for millennia . Until the sixteenth century , comets were usually considered bad omens of deaths of kings or noble men , or coming catastrophes , or even interpreted as attacks by heavenly beings against terrestrial inhabitants . 
 Aristotle believed that comets were atmospheric phenomena , due to the fact that they could appear outside of the Zodiac and vary in brightness over the course of a few days . Pliny the Elder believed that comets were connected with political unrest and death . 
 In the 16th century Tycho Brahe demonstrated that comets must exist outside the Earth 's atmosphere by measuring the parallax of the Great Comet of 1577 from observations collected by geographically separated observers . Within the precision of the measurements , this implied the comet must be at least four times more distant than from the Earth to the Moon . 
 = = = Orbital studies = = = 
 Isaac Newton , in his Principia Mathematica of 1687 , proved that an object moving under the influence of his inverse square law of universal gravitation must trace out an orbit shaped like one of the conic sections , and he demonstrated how to fit a comet 's path through the sky to a parabolic orbit , using the comet of 1680 as an example . 
 In 1705 , Edmond Halley ( 1656 – 1742 ) applied Newton 's method to twenty @-@ three cometary apparitions that had occurred between 1337 and 1698 . He noted that three of these , the comets of 1531 , 1607 , and 1682 , had very similar orbital elements , and he was further able to account for the slight differences in their orbits in terms of gravitational perturbation by Jupiter and Saturn . Confident that these three apparitions had been three appearances of the same comet , he predicted that it would appear again in 1758 – 9 . Halley 's predicted return date was later refined by a team of three French mathematicians : Alexis Clairaut , Joseph Lalande , and Nicole @-@ Reine <unk> , who predicted the date of the comet 's 1759 perihelion to within one month 's accuracy . When the comet returned as predicted , it became known as Halley 's Comet ( with the latter @-@ day designation of 1P / Halley ) . It will next appear in 2061 . 
 = = = Studies of physical characteristics = = = 
 Isaac Newton described comets as compact and durable solid bodies moving in oblique orbit and their tails as thin streams of vapor emitted by their nuclei , ignited or heated by the Sun . Newton suspected that comets were the origin of the life @-@ supporting component of air . 
 As early as the 18th century , some scientists had made correct hypotheses as to comets ' physical composition . In 1755 , Immanuel Kant hypothesized that comets are composed of some volatile substance , whose vaporization gives rise to their brilliant displays near perihelion . In 1836 , the German mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel , after observing streams of vapor during the appearance of Halley 's Comet in 1835 , proposed that the jet forces of evaporating material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet 's orbit , and he argued that the non @-@ gravitational movements of Encke 's Comet resulted from this phenomenon . 
 In 1950 , Fred Lawrence Whipple proposed that rather than being rocky objects containing some ice , comets were icy objects containing some dust and rock . This " dirty snowball " model soon became accepted and appeared to be supported by the observations of an armada of spacecraft ( including the European Space Agency 's Giotto probe and the Soviet Union 's Vega 1 and Vega 2 ) that flew through the coma of Halley 's Comet in 1986 , photographed the nucleus , and observed jets of evaporating material . 
 On 22 January 2014 , ESA scientists reported the detection , for the first definitive time , of water vapor on the dwarf planet Ceres , the largest object in the asteroid belt . The detection was made by using the far @-@ infrared abilities of the Herschel Space Observatory . The finding is unexpected because comets , not asteroids , are typically considered to " sprout jets and plumes " . According to one of the scientists , " The lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids . " On 11 August 2014 , astronomers released studies , using the Atacama Large Millimeter / Submillimeter Array ( ALMA ) for the first time , that detailed the distribution of HCN , HNC , H 
 2CO , and dust inside the <unk> of comets C / 2012 F6 ( Lemmon ) and C / 2012 S1 ( ISON ) . 
 = = = Spacecraft missions = = = 
 The Halley Armada describes the collection of spacecraft missions that visited and / or made observations of Halley 's Comet 1980s perihelion . 
 Deep Impact . Debate continues about how much ice is in a comet . In 2001 , the Deep Space 1 spacecraft obtained high @-@ resolution images of the surface of Comet Borrelly . It was found that the surface of comet Borrelly is hot and dry , with a temperature of between 26 to 71 ° C ( 79 to 160 ° F ) , and extremely dark , suggesting that the ice has been removed by solar heating and maturation , or is hidden by the soot @-@ like material that covers Borrelly 's . In July 2005 , the Deep Impact probe blasted a crater on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior . The mission yielded results suggesting that the majority of a comet 's water ice is below the surface and that these reservoirs feed the jets of vaporised water that form the coma of Tempel 1 . Renamed EPOXI , it made a flyby of Comet Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010 . 
 Stardust . Data from the Stardust mission show that materials retrieved from the tail of Wild 2 were crystalline and could only have been " born in fire , " at extremely high temperatures of over 1 @,@ 000 ° C ( 1 @,@ 830 ° F ) . Although comets formed in the outer Solar System , radial mixing of material during the early formation of the Solar System is thought to have redistributed material throughout the proto @-@ planetary disk , so comets also contain crystalline grains that formed in the hot inner Solar System . This is seen in comet spectra as well as in sample return missions . More recent still , the materials retrieved demonstrate that the " comet dust resembles asteroid materials " . These new results have forced scientists to rethink the nature of comets and their distinction from asteroids . 
 Rosetta . The Rosetta probe is presently in erratic orbit around Comet Churyumov – Gerasimenko . On 12 November 2014 , its lander Philae successfully landed on the comet 's surface , the first time a spacecraft has ever landed on such an object in history . 
 = = = Great comets = = = 
 Approximately once a decade , a comet becomes bright enough to be noticed by a casual observer , leading such comets to be designated as great comets . Predicting whether a comet will become a great comet is notoriously difficult , as many factors may cause a comet 's brightness to depart drastically from predictions . Broadly speaking , if a comet has a large and active nucleus , will pass close to the Sun , and is not obscured by the Sun as seen from the Earth when at its brightest , it has a chance of becoming a great comet . However , Comet Kohoutek in 1973 fulfilled all the criteria and was expected to become spectacular but failed to do so . Comet West , which appeared three years later , had much lower expectations but became an extremely impressive comet . 
 The late 20th century saw a lengthy gap without the appearance of any great comets , followed by the arrival of two in quick succession — Comet Hyakutake in 1996 , followed by Hale – Bopp , which reached maximum brightness in 1997 having been discovered two years earlier . The first great comet of the 21st century was C / 2006 P1 ( McNaught ) , which became visible to naked eye observers in January 2007 . It was the brightest in over 40 years . 
 = = = <unk> comets = = = 
 A sungrazing comet is a comet that passes extremely close to the Sun at perihelion , generally within a few million kilometres . Although small sungrazers can be completely evaporated during such a close approach to the Sun , larger sungrazers can survive many perihelion passages . However , the strong tidal forces they experience often lead to their fragmentation . 
 About 90 % of the sungrazers observed with SOHO are members of the Kreutz group , which all originate from one giant comet that broke up into many smaller comets during its first passage through the inner Solar System . The remainder contains some sporadic sungrazers , but four other related groups of comets have been identified among them : the Kracht , Kracht 2a , Marsden , and Meyer groups . The Marsden and Kracht groups both appear to be related to Comet <unk> / <unk> , which is also the parent of two meteor streams , the <unk> and the Arietids . 
 = = = Unusual comets = = = 
 Of the thousands of known comets , some exhibit unusual properties . Comet Encke ( 2P / Encke ) orbits from outside the asteroid belt to just inside the orbit of the planet Mercury whereas the Comet <unk> / <unk> – Wachmann currently travels in a nearly circular orbit entirely between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn . 2060 Chiron , whose unstable orbit is between Saturn and Uranus , was originally classified as an asteroid until a faint coma was noticed . Similarly , Comet Shoemaker – Levy 2 was originally designated asteroid 1990 <unk> . ( See also Fate of comets . ) 
 = = = Centaurs = = = 
 Centaurs typically behave with characteristics of both asteroids and comets . Centaurs can be classified as comets such as <unk> Echeclus , and <unk> / NEAT . <unk> / NEAT was discovered while it exhibited a coma , and so is classified as a comet despite its orbit , and <unk> Echeclus was discovered without a coma but later became active , and was then classified as both a comet and an asteroid ( <unk> / Echeclus ) . One plan for Cassini involved sending it to a centaur , but NASA decided to destroy it instead . 
 = = Observation = = 
 A comet may be discovered photographically using a wide @-@ field telescope or visually with binoculars . However , even without access to optical equipment , it is still possible for the amateur astronomer to discover a sungrazing comet online by downloading images accumulated by some satellite observatories such as SOHO . SOHO 's 2000th comet was discovered by Polish amateur astronomer Michał <unk> on 26 December 2010 and both discoverers of Hale @-@ Bopp used amateur equipment ( although Hale was not an amateur ) . 
 = = = Lost = = = 
 A number of periodic comets discovered in earlier decades or previous centuries are now lost comets . Their orbits were never known well enough to predict future appearances or the comets have disintegrated . However , occasionally a " new " comet is discovered , and calculation of its orbit shows it to be an old " lost " comet . An example is Comet 11P / Tempel – Swift – LINEAR , discovered in 1869 but unobservable after 1908 because of perturbations by Jupiter . It was not found again until accidentally rediscovered by LINEAR in 2001 . There are at least 18 comets that fit this category .

 The depiction of comets in popular culture is firmly rooted in the long Western tradition of seeing comets as harbingers of doom and as omens of world @-@ altering change . Halley 's Comet alone has caused a slew of sensationalist publications of all sorts at each of its reappearances . It was especially noted that the birth and death of some notable persons coincided with separate appearances of the comet , such as with writers Mark Twain ( who correctly speculated that he 'd " go out with the comet " in 1910 ) and Eudora Welty , to whose life Mary Chapin Carpenter dedicated the song " Halley Came to Jackson " . 
 In times past , bright comets often inspired panic and hysteria in the general population , being thought of as bad omens . More recently , during the passage of Halley 's Comet in 1910 , the Earth passed through the comet 's tail , and erroneous newspaper reports inspired a fear that cyanogen in the tail might poison millions , whereas the appearance of Comet Hale – Bopp in 1997 triggered the mass suicide of the Heaven 's Gate cult . 
 In science fiction , the impact of comets has been depicted as a threat overcome by technology and heroism ( Deep Impact , 1998 and Armageddon , 1998 ) , or as a trigger of global apocalypse ( Lucifer 's Hammer , 1979 ) or zombies ( Night of the Comet , 1984 ) . In Jules Verne 's Off on a Comet a group of people are stranded on a comet orbiting the Sun , while a large manned space expedition visits Halley 's Comet in Sir Arthur C. Clarke 's novel 2061 : Odyssey Three .

 Major General Edward James Milford CB , CBE , DSO ( 10 December 1894 – 10 June 1972 ) was an Australian Army officer who fought in the First and the Second World Wars . 
 Born in Melbourne , Milford graduated from the Royal Military College in 1915 . Commissioned as a lieutenant in the Australian Imperial Force , he served with the Field Artillery of the 2nd Division for most of the First World War . Remaining in the military for the interwar period , he held a number of postings in ordnance and artillery in Australia and England . During the early years of the Second World War , he served as master @-@ general of the ordnance . He later commanded the 5th and 7th Divisions during the New Guinea and Borneo campaigns . He accepted the surrender of Japanese forces in Dutch Borneo on 8 September 1945 . He retired from the army in 1948 , due to an illness which was later found to be a misdiagnosis , and died in 1972 at the age of 77 .

 Following graduation from Duntroon in 1915 , Milford was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) and was assigned to the 4th Field Artillery Brigade , 2nd Division . Serving initially in the Middle East , he was posted to the Western Front in March 1916 . He held regimental and staff positions until being wounded in September 1917 , by which time he had been promoted to major . His wounds were such that he was evacuated to England for treatment . Upon recovery , he returned to the 4th Field Artillery Brigade . In command of the 11th Battery from February 1918 , he was recommended and awarded the Distinguished Service Order as well as a mention in despatches for his efforts in controlling artillery support during operations on the Somme and the Battle of Amiens .

 Milford opted to undertake training in ordnance in England after the war , and also became married at this time . He held a number of ordnance related postings in both England and Australia , and attended the British Army Staff College at Camberley . He served for a time as chairman of the Resource Committee dedicated to " hardware , general stores and clothing " ( there were seven such committees , each dedicated to a specific area of defence resources ) , which reported to the Defence Resources Board . At the time of the outbreak of the Second World War , he was director of artillery at Army headquarters in Melbourne , where he had been posted for four years . 
 = = = Second World War = = = 
 In March 1940 , Milford was assigned to the newly formed 7th Division as commander of the division 's artillery , one of a number of officers from the Staff Corps appointed to the division . He traveled to the Middle East in October but was destined to spend only a few weeks in his position before being recalled to Australia in January 1941 to take up the post of master @-@ general of the ordnance . He was also promoted to temporary major general , the first Duntroon graduate to reach the rank of general . In his new appointment , he was tasked with co @-@ ordination of private and government manufacturers and producers to provide logistic support for Australia 's soldiers , both at home and overseas . He was also involved with a committee investigating the supply requirements of each of the services and the available resources , as well as the development of new weapons . When the Owen gun , an Australian designed and manufactured submachine gun , was brought to his attention , he initially favoured the use of the Sten , even though it proved to be less reliable than the Owen . 
 = = = = New Guinea campaign = = = = 
 In 1942 , Milford was commander of the 5th Division , then based in Queensland and intended for operations against the Japanese Empire . He landed with elements of his division at Milne Bay on the eastern tip of New Guinea on 14 January 1943 and began operations on nearby Goodenough Island . The island had recently been captured from the Japanese but only a small Australian garrison was present to guard against any attempt by the enemy to take it back . Dummy buildings and fortifications were built to give the Japanese the impression that the Australian presence on Goodenough was greater than it actually was , and may have deterred them from attempting to retake the island . By April the Japanese threat to Goodenough had receded and an air strip was under construction . 
 In late August 1943 , the 5th Division moved to the Morobe Province of New Guinea to replace the 3rd Division , which was then participating in the Salamaua – Lae campaign . Milford was tasked with continuing offensive operations against the Japanese around Salamaua to divert resources away from the nearby Japanese base in the town of Lae . Once the neighbouring 9th Division commenced their attack to capture Lae on 4 September by landing east of the town to begin an encircling movement , the 5th Division moved to take Salamaua , which eventually fell to the Australians on 11 September . 
 Salamaua was intended to become a large base for the Allied forces in the region , but when Lieutenant General Edmund Herring inspected the area immediately following its capture it was deemed not suitable . Instead , Herring directed Milford to establish the base at newly captured Lae . Milford supervised the construction of roads and supply depots of the " Lae Fortress " until 3 November , when he was made general staff officer of the New Guinea Force ( NGF ) . He would be recommended for an appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his leadership and service in Lae and with the NGF . 
 = = = = Borneo campaign = = = = 
 In July 1944 , he succeeded his friend ( and fellow Duntroon classmate ) Major General George Vasey as commander of the 7th Division . The division had been resting and refitting in Australia since its withdrawal in early 1944 from New Guinea following the Ramu Valley campaign , which had been conducted in the aftermath of the capture of Lae . 
 In early 1945 , planning was underway for Operation Oboe Two , an amphibious assault to capture Balikpapan , a seaport on Borneo . The 9th Division was originally designated for the operation , but in April it was decided to utilise the 7th Division instead , and it duly embarked from Cairns to Morotai , the staging post for the assault . Operation Oboe Two would transpire to be the largest amphibious operation mounted by the Australian military . Despite opposition from the American naval commanders providing support for the operation , Milford decided to land his forces at Klandasan , a southern suburb of Balikpapan which although heavily defended , had suitable beaches for landing troops . By landing at Klandasan , Milford hoped to achieve tactical surprise and anticipated fire support from the United States Navy would help counter the coastal defences of the Japanese . The battle of Balikpapan began on 1 July with a naval barrage of the landing area , supported by bombers of the Royal Australian Air Force , with the division landing relatively unopposed by mid morning . By 1pm , the beachhead was secure and Milford , together with Generals Douglas MacArthur and Leslie Morshead made an inspection of the area . At this late stage of the war it was clear that the war would soon end , and extensive use was made of divisional artillery ( which Milford had raised during his earlier spell with the division in 1940 ) rather than needlessly risk soldiers ' lives . By 21 July , Balikpapan was secure and the Japanese were retreating into Borneo . Milford ordered a halt to further offensive action and instructed his outlying forces to hold their position , thus concluding a successful operation . 
 The war was now rapidly drawing to a close and upon the surrender of the Japanese Empire in August , Milford was ordered to accept the surrender of the representative commander of the Japanese forces , which numbered around 8 @,@ 500 troops , in Dutch @-@ Borneo . On 8 September , Milford observed the surrender of the Japanese military governor of the area , Vice Admiral Michiaki <unk> , in a ceremony held aboard HMAS Burdekin which was anchored off the coast of Dutch Borneo .

 Milford remained the commander of the 7th Division , as well as the Morotai occupation force , until March 1946 . He returned to Melbourne , replacing Major General John Chapman as Deputy Chief of General Staff on 11 March . An appointment as adjutant general followed in May . He retired on 23 April 1948 due to ill health but this was due to an incorrect diagnosis of prostate cancer . In 1946 , he had been recommended for appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath for his leadership during Operation Oboe Two , and was duly presented with the Order in 1949 . 
 Milford died in Macleod , Melbourne on 10 June 1972 , and was survived by his son ( a 1944 graduate of the Royal Military College at Duntroon ) . 
 = Live and Let Die ( film ) = 
 Live and Let Die ( 1973 ) is the eighth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions , and the first to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond . Produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman , it was the third of four Bond films to be directed by Guy Hamilton . Although the producers had wanted Sean Connery to return after his role in the previous Bond film Diamonds Are Forever , he declined , sparking a search for a new actor to play James Bond . Moore was signed for the lead role . 
 The film is adapted from the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming . In the film , a Harlem drug lord known as Mr. Big plans to distribute two tons of heroin free to put rival drugs barons out of business . Mr. Big is revealed to be the disguised alter ego of Dr. Kananga , a corrupt Caribbean dictator , who rules San Monique , the fictional island where the heroin poppies are secretly farmed . Bond is investigating the deaths of three British agents , leading him to Kananga , and is soon trapped in a world of gangsters and voodoo as he fights to put a stop to the drug baron 's scheme . 
 Live and Let Die was released during the height of the blaxploitation era , and many blaxploitation archetypes and clichés are depicted in the film , including derogatory racial epithets ( " honky " ) , black gangsters , and <unk> . It departs from the former plots of the James Bond films about megalomaniac super @-@ villains , and instead focuses on drug trafficking , a common theme of blaxploitation films of the period . It is set in African American cultural centres such as Harlem and New Orleans , as well as the Caribbean Islands . It was also the first James Bond film featuring an African American Bond girl to be romantically involved with 007 , Rosie Carver , who was played by Gloria Hendry . The film was a box office success and received generally positive reviews from critics . It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song for " Live and Let Die " , written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by their band Wings . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Three MI6 agents , including one " on loan " to the American government , are killed under mysterious circumstances within 24 hours of each other in the United Nations , New Orleans and a Caribbean nation , San Monique , while monitoring the operations of the island 's dictator Dr. Kananga . James Bond , agent 007 , is sent to New York City to investigate the first murder . Kananga is also in New York , visiting the United Nations and representing San Monique . Just after Bond arrives , his driver is shot dead by Whisper , one of Kananga 's men , while taking Bond to meet Felix Leiter of the CIA . Bond is nearly killed in the ensuing car crash . 
 A trace on the killer 's licence plate eventually leads Bond to Mr. Big , a ruthless gangster who runs a chain of Fillet of Soul restaurants throughout the United States . It is here that Bond first meets Solitaire , a beautiful tarot expert who has the power of the <unk> and can see both the future and remote events in the present . Mr. Big , who is actually Kananga in disguise , demands that his henchmen kill Bond , but Bond overpowers them and escapes unscathed . Bond flies to San Monique , where he meets Rosie Carver , a CIA double agent . They meet up with a friend of Bond 's , Quarrel Jr . , who takes them by boat near Solitaire 's home . Bond suspects Rosie of working for Kananga . She is shot dead , remotely , by Kananga , to stop her confessing the truth to Bond . Inside Solitaire 's house , Bond uses a stacked tarot deck of cards , that show only " The Lovers " , to trick her into thinking that seduction is in her future , and then seduces her . Solitaire loses her ability to foretell the future when she loses her virginity to Bond , and decides to co @-@ operate with Bond as she has feelings for him and has grown tired of being controlled by Kananga . 
 Bond and Solitaire escape by boat and fly to New Orleans . There , Bond is captured by Kananga . It transpires that Kananga is producing two tons of heroin and is protecting the poppy fields by exploiting San Monique locals ' fear of voodoo priest Baron Samedi , and the occult . Through his alter ego , Mr. Big , Kananga plans to distribute the heroin free of charge at his Fillet of Soul restaurants , which will increase the number of addicts . Kananga also believes that other drug dealers , namely the Mafia , cannot compete with his giveaway , to which Kananga can later charge high prices for the heroin , after he has simultaneously cultivated huge drug dependencies and bankrupted his competitors . 
 When Kananga finds out that Bond slept with Solitaire , he turns her over to Baron Samedi to be sacrificed . He is angry because her ability to read tarot cards is gone , and he wanted to be the one to take her powers away . Meanwhile , Kananga 's one @-@ armed henchman , Tee Hee Johnson , leaves Bond to be eaten by <unk> at a farm in the Louisiana backwoods . Bond escapes by running along the animals ' backs to safety . He sets a drug lab on fire and steals a speedboat . He is then pursued by Kananga 's men , as well as Sheriff J.W. Pepper and the Louisiana State Police . 
 Back in San Monique , Bond has set timed explosives throughout the poppy fields . He rescues Solitaire from the voodoo sacrifice and throws Samedi into a coffin of poisonous snakes . Bond and Solitaire escape below ground into Kananga 's lair . Kananga captures them both and proceeds to lower them into a shark tank . Bond escapes and forces a shark gun pellet into Kananga 's mouth , causing him to inflate like a balloon , float to the top of the cave , and explode . 
 After the job is done , Leiter puts Bond and Solitaire onto a train and out of the country . Tee Hee Johnson follows Bond and Solitaire onto the train and tries to kill Bond , but loses his prosthetic arm in a fight with him and is flung out of the window . As the film ends , a laughing Samedi is revealed to be perched on the front of the speeding train .

 = = Production = = 
 While filming Diamonds Are Forever , Live and Let Die was chosen as the next Ian Fleming novel to be adapted because screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz thought it would be daring to use black villains , as the Black Panthers and other racial movements were active at this time . Guy Hamilton was again chosen to direct , and since he was a jazz fan , Mankiewicz suggested he film in New Orleans . Hamilton did not want to use Mardi Gras since Thunderball featured Junkanoo , a similar festivity , so after more discussions with the writer and location scouting with helicopters , he decided to use two well @-@ known features of the city , the jazz funerals and the canals . 
 To develop a better feel of how Voodoo was practised , Saltzman and Broccoli escorted Hamilton , Mankiewicz and production designer Syd Cain to scout New Orleans further and then the islands of the West Indies . Haiti was an important destination of the tour and not only did Fleming connect it with the religion , there were many practitioners available to witness . Despite viewing actual demonstrations , due to political unrest in the country at the time , it was decided not to film in Haiti . 
 While searching for locations in Jamaica , the crew discovered a crocodile farm owned by Ross Kananga , after passing a sign warning that " trespassers will be eaten . " The farm was put into the script and also inspired Mankiewicz to name the film 's villain after Kananga .

 Broccoli and Saltzman tried to convince Sean Connery to return as 007 , but he declined . The two producers then approached Clint Eastwood , who was fresh from his success as Dirty Harry , also turned down the offer , stating that 007 should be played by an Englishman . Among the actors to test for the part of Bond were Julian Glover , John Gavin , Jeremy Brett , Simon Oates , John <unk> , and William Gaunt . The main frontrunner for the role was Michael Billington . United Artists wanted an American to play Bond ; Burt Reynolds , Paul Newman and Robert Redford were all considered . Producer Albert R. Broccoli , however , insisted that the part should be played by a British actor and put forward Roger Moore . After Moore was chosen , Billington remained on the top of the list in the event that Moore would decline to come back for the next film . Billington ultimately played a brief villainous role in the pre @-@ credit sequence of The Spy Who Loved Me ( 1977 ) . Moore , who had been considered by the producers before both Dr. No and On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , was ultimately cast . He tried not to imitate either Connery 's or his own prior performance as Simon Templar in The Saint , and Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay into Moore 's persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light @-@ hearted approach to Bond . 
 Mankiewicz had thought of turning Solitaire into a black woman , with Diana Ross as his primary choice . However , Broccoli and Saltzman decided to stick to Fleming 's description of a white woman , and after thinking of Catherine Deneuve , Jane Seymour , who was in the TV series The <unk> Line , was cast for the role . Yaphet Kotto was cast while doing another movie for United Artists , Across 110th Street . Kotto reported one of the things he liked in the role was Kananga 's interest in the occult , " feeling like he can control past , present and future " . 
 Mankiewicz created Sheriff J.W. Pepper to add a comic relief character . Portrayed by Clifton James , Pepper appeared again in The Man with the Golden Gun . Live and Let Die is also the first of two films featuring David Hedison as Felix Leiter , who reprised the role in Licence to Kill . Hedison had said " I was sure that would be my first and last " , before being cast again . 
 Madeline Smith , who played Miss Caruso , sharing Bond 's bed in the film 's opening , was recommended for the part by Roger Moore after he had appeared with her on TV . Smith said that Moore was extremely polite to work with , but she felt very uncomfortable being clad in only blue bikini panties while Moore 's wife was on set overseeing the scene . 
 This was the only Bond film until 2006 not to feature ' Q ' , played at this stage by Desmond Llewelyn . He was then appearing in the TV series <unk> , but was written out of three episodes to appear in the film . By then , Saltzman and Broccoli decided not to include the character , feeling that " too much was being made of the films ' gadgets " , and decided to downplay this aspect of the series , much to Llewelyn 's annoyance . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography began in October 1972 , in Louisiana . For a while only the second unit was shot after Moore was diagnosed with kidney stones . In November production moved to Jamaica , which doubled for the fictional San Monique . In December , production was divided between interiors in Pinewood Studios and location shooting in Harlem . The producers were reportedly required to pay protection money to a local Harlem gang to ensure the crew 's safety . When the cash ran out , they were " encouraged " to leave . Some exteriors were in fact shot in Manhattan 's Upper East Side as a result of the difficulties of using real Harlem locations . 
 Ross Kananga suggested the stunt of Bond jumping on crocodiles , and was enlisted by the producers to perform it . The scene took five takes to be completed , including one in which the last crocodile snapped at Kananga 's heel , tearing his trousers . The production also had trouble with snakes . The script supervisor was so afraid that she refused to be on set with them ; an actor fainted while filming a scene where he is killed by a snake ; Jane Seymour became terrified as a reptile got closer , and Geoffrey Holder only agreed to fall into the snake @-@ filled casket because Princess Alexandra was visiting the set . 
 The boat chase was filmed in Louisiana around the Irish Bayou area , with some interruption caused by flooding . Twenty @-@ six boats were built by the <unk> boat company for the film . Seventeen were destroyed during rehearsals . The speedboat jump scene over the bayou , filmed with the assistance of a specially @-@ constructed ramp , unintentionally set a Guinness World Record at the time with 110 feet ( 34 m ) cleared . The waves created by the impact caused the following boat to flip over . 
 The chase involving the double @-@ decker bus was filmed with a second @-@ hand London bus adapted by having a top section removed , and then placed back in situ running on ball bearings to allow to slide off on impact . The stunts involving the bus were performed by Maurice <unk> , a London Transport bus driving instructor . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 John Barry , who had worked on the previous five themes and orchestrated the " James Bond Theme " , was unavailable during production . Broccoli and Saltzman instead asked Paul McCartney to write the theme song . Since McCartney 's salary was high and another composer could not be hired with the remainder of the music budget , George Martin , who had been McCartney 's producer while with The Beatles , was chosen to write the score for the film . " Live and Let Die " , written by McCartney along with his wife Linda and performed by their group Wings , was the first true rock and roll song used to open a Bond film , and became a major success in the UK ( where it reached number nine in the charts ) and the US ( where it reached number 2 , for three weeks ) . It was nominated for an Academy Award but lost to " The Way We Were " . Producers hired B. J. Arnau to record and perform the title song , not realising McCartney intended to perform it himself . Arnau 's version was featured in the film itself , when the singer performed it in a night club which Bond attends . 
 The Olympia Brass Band has a notable part in " Live and Let Die " , where they lead a funeral march for a ( soon to be ) assassination victim . Trumpeter Alvin Alcorn plays the killer . The piece of music the band plays at the beginning of the funeral march is " Just a Closer Walk with Thee " . After the agent is stabbed , the band starts playing the more lively " Joe Avery 's Piece " ( aka " New Second Line " ) .

 Despite poor reaction to the racial overtones , reviews were mostly positive , with praise for the action scenes , and Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 66 % " fresh " rating . 
 Ian Nathan of Empire magazine wrote " This is good quality Bond , managing to reinterpret the classic moves - action , deduction , seduction - for a more modern idiom without breaking the mould . On one side we get the use of alligators as stepping stones and the pompous <unk> of <unk> ' <unk> ' Sheriff Pepper caught up in the thrilling boat chase . On the other , the genuine aura of threat through weird voodoo henchman Tee Hee and the leaning toward - what 's this ? - realism in Mr Big 's plot to take over the drug trade from the Mafia . " He concluded that " Moore had got his feet under the table . " 
 Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times stated that Moore " has the superficial attributes for the job : The urbanity , the <unk> raised eyebrow , the calm under fire and in bed " . However , he felt that Moore wasn 't satisfactory in living up to the legacy left by Sean Connery in the preceding films . He rated the villains " a little banal " , adding that the film " doesn 't have a Bond villain worthy of the <unk> , Dr. Nos and <unk> of the past . " Chris Nashawaty similarly argues that Dr. Kananga / Mr. Big is the worst villain of the Roger Moore James Bond films . BBC Films reviewer William <unk> praised the use of locations , but said that the plot was " convoluted " . He stated that " Connery and Lazenby had an air of concealed <unk> , clenched fists at the ready , but in Moore 's case a sardonic quip and a raised eyebrow are his deadliest weapons " . Reviewer Leonard Maltin rated the film two and a half stars out of four , describing it as a " barely memorable , overlong James Bond movie " that " seems merely an excuse to film wild chase sequences " . Danny Peary noted that Jane Seymour portrays " one of the Bond series 's most beautiful heroines " but had little praise for Moore , whom he described as making " an unimpressive debut as James Bond in Tom Mankiewicz 's unimaginative adaptation of Ian Fleming 's second novel … The movie stumbles along most of the way . It 's hard to remember Moore is playing Bond at times – in fact , if he and Seymour were black , the picture could pass as one of the black exploitation films of the day . There are few interesting action sequences – a motorboat chase is trite enough to begin with , but the filmmakers make it worse by throwing in some stupid Louisiana cops , including pot @-@ bellied Sheriff Pepper .

 IGN ranked Solitaire as 10th in a Top 10 Bond Babes list . In November 2006 , Entertainment Weekly listed Live and Let Die as the third best Bond film . MSN chose it as the thirteenth best Bond film and IGN listed it as twelfth best . 
 = Coandă @-@ 1910 = 
 The Coandă @-@ 1910 , designed by Romanian inventor Henri Coandă , was an unconventional sesquiplane aircraft powered by a ducted fan . Called the " turbo @-@ propulseur " by Coandă , its experimental engine consisted of a conventional piston engine driving a multi @-@ bladed centrifugal blower which exhausted into a duct . The unusual aircraft attracted attention at the Second International Aeronautical Exhibition in Paris in October 1910 , being the only exhibit without a propeller , but the aircraft was not displayed afterward and it fell from public awareness . Coandă used a similar turbo @-@ propulseur to drive a snow sled , but he did not develop it further for aircraft . 
 Decades later , after the practical demonstration of <unk> and turbojets , Coandă began to tell various conflicting stories about how his early experiments were precursors to the jet , even that his turbo @-@ propulseur was the first motorjet engine complete with fuel combustion in the airstream . He also claimed to have made a single brief flight in December 1910 , crashing just after takeoff , the aircraft being destroyed by fire . Two aviation historians countered Coandă 's version of events , saying there was no proof that the engine had combustion in the airstream , and no proof that the aircraft ever flew . In 1965 , Coandă brought drawings forward to prove his claim of combustion ducting but these were shown to be recently reworked , differing substantially from the originals . Many aviation historians were dismissive , saying that Coandă 's turbo @-@ propulseur design involved a weak stream of " plain air " , not a powerful jet of air expanding from fuel combustion . 
 In 2010 , based on the notion that Coandă invented the first jet , the centennial of the jet aircraft was celebrated in Romania . A special coin and stamp were issued , and construction began on a working replica of the aircraft . At the European Parliament , an exhibition commemorated the building and testing of the Coandă @-@ 1910 . 
 = = Early developments = = 
 Coandă was interested in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905 , conducting tests of rockets attached to model aircraft at the Romanian Army arsenal in Bucharest . In secret , at Spandau in Germany , Coandă successfully tested a flying machine equipped with a single tractor propeller , and two counter @-@ rotating propellers providing lift , powered by a 50 @-@ horsepower ( 37 kW ) Antoinette engine . Positioned along the fuselage centreline , the smaller rear lift propeller was mounted vertically , while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17 degrees . According to later claims , Coandă tested the aircraft at Cassel , witnessed by the Chancellor of the German Empire Bernhard von Bülow . It was around this time that Coandă 's interest in jet propulsion began , claiming that the aircraft and a jet @-@ propelled model were displayed in December 1907 at the <unk> indoor sports arena in Berlin . Coandă continued his studies at Liege , Belgium , where together with his roommate and friend Giovanni Battista Caproni he built the Coandă @-@ Caproni box glider , based on the plans of gliders designed by Otto Lilienthal and Octave Chanute which he previously studied at Charlottenburg and Spandau . In 1909 he was employed as technical director of the Liège @-@ Spa <unk> , and at the end of that year , with the help of car manufacturer Joachim he built the Coandă @-@ Joachim glider . Caproni was present when the glider was flown at Spa @-@ <unk> , Belgium . 
 = = 1910s = = 
 With the opening of the École supérieure d <unk> et de constructions <unk> on 15 November 1909 , Coandă moved to Paris . As a continuation of his Belgian experiments , and especially looking for a way to test wing airfoils at higher speeds , he contacted Ernest Archdeacon , the co @-@ founder of L <unk> @-@ Club de France , who in turn directed Coandă to Gustav Eiffel and Paul <unk> . With their assistance , he gained approval to test different wing configurations and air resistance on a platform built by Eiffel at the front of a locomotive on the North of France railway . In March , he started flying lessons at Reims in a Hanriot monoplane . 
 Helped by his schoolfriend <unk> @-@ <unk> , Coandă started to build his slender sesquiplane and the unusual powerplant in a workshop in the courtyard of his house where he tested the thrust of the powerplant on a dynamometer , tests which are described in detail in the April 1910 edition of La Technique Aéronautique . He filed for several patents for the mechanism and aircraft on 30 May 1910 , with later additions to the existing patents . 
 Coandă exhibited the aircraft at the Second International Aeronautical Exhibition ( commonly referred to as the Paris salon , or Paris flight salon ) held from 15 October to 2 November 1910 . Together with Henri Fabre 's <unk> , the first floatplane , Coandă 's aircraft and devices used for aerodynamic experiments were placed " in solitary state " in an upstairs gallery , separated from the more usual types of aircraft on the main exhibition floor . 
 The aircraft 's construction was a novelty for the time . In contrast to the monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application , the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction , but in return solved lateral stability control issues . The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires . According to Coandă 's description the wings were built with metal spars , but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure . The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing , and were controlled by pedals in the two @-@ seat open cockpit . The fuselage , painted reddish @-@ brown and highly polished , was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel , though the construction photographs indicate that it had a wooden framework . This was triangular in cross @-@ section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel , and strengthened with a covering of heat @-@ shaped moulded plywood . Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located on either side of the cockpit . The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws . The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45 ° angles to vertical and horizontal . Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII @-@ style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit , one on each side , and were used for pitch and directional control . It was an early instance of what are now known as <unk> . Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser . The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit . 
 The most remarkable feature of the aircraft was its powerplant . Instead of a propeller , a 50 hp ( 37 kW ) inline water @-@ cooled internal combustion engine built by Pierre Clerget at the Clément @-@ Bayard workshop with funding from L <unk> @-@ Club de France , placed in the forward section of the fuselage drove a rotary compressor through a 1 : 4 gearbox ( 1 @,@ 000 rpm on the Clerget turned the compressor at 4 @,@ 000 rpm ) , which drew air in from the front and expelled it rearward under compression and with added heat . The compressor , with a diameter of 50 centimetres ( 20 in ) , was located within a cowling at the front of the fuselage . According to later Coandă descriptions , cast aluminium components were also made by Clerget to create a powerplant with a weight of 1 @.@ 8 kilograms per kilowatt ( 2 @.@ 9 lb / hp ) – equivalent to a power @-@ to @-@ weight ratio of 0 @.@ 59 kilowatts per kilogram ( 0 @.@ 36 hp / lb ) , a considerable achievement at the time . 
 Coandă 's 1910s @-@ era patents describe the inline piston engine 's exhaust gases as being routed through heating channels or heat exchangers in contact with the central air flow , then sucked into the compressor inlet to reduce back @-@ pressure on the engine while adding more heat and mass to the airflow . The turbo @-@ propulseur was claimed to be capable of generating 2 @.@ 20 kilonewtons ( 220 kgf ; 490 lbf ) of thrust . The powerplant was referred to in reports at the time by different terms : a turbine without propellers , turbo @-@ propulseur , ducted fan or a suction turbine . 
 Aviation reporters from The Aero and La Technique <unk> were doubtful that the powerplant could provide sufficient thrust . The engine was noted in The Aero , reprinted in Aircraft , as being " of remarkably small proportions in relation to the size of the machine . " The writer said the turbo @-@ propulseur was " claimed to give an enormous wind velocity " , but the intake area seemed too small to produce the stated thrust , and that " it also appears as if enormous power would be necessary to drive it " , more than supplied by the Clerget . 
 The Coandă @-@ 1910 was reportedly sold to Charles Weymann in October 1910 . A daily newspaper from Bucharest wrote in 1910 that the aircraft was constructed in Clerget 's workshops and that it " will fly in 6 – 7 weeks near Paris , piloted by Weymann , one of the pilots celebrated at the Rennes aviation meeting . " Another Bucharest newspaper listed the aircraft in November as " sold twice @-@ over " . It may be that Weymann expressed his willingness to buy the aircraft once tests had been carried out . 
 At the exhibition , reaction among observers was mixed . Some doubted the aircraft would fly , and focused on more likely machines such as the Sloan , the Voisin , or Louis Paulhan 's design . Others gave special notice to the Coandă @-@ 1910 , calling it original and ingenious . The reporter from La Technique <unk> wrote , " In the absence of definitive trials , permitting the precise yield of this machine , it is without doubt premature to say it will supersede the propeller ... the tentative is interesting and we watch it closely . " The official exhibition report ignored the turbo @-@ propulseur engine and instead described Coandă 's novel wing design , and the unusual empennage . On 15 November 1910 , L 'Aérophile wrote that if the machine were ever to develop as the inventor hoped , it would be " a beautiful dream " . 
 After the exhibition the aircraft was moved to a Clément @-@ Bayard workshop at Issy @-@ les @-@ Moulineaux for further testing . This work is reflected by additions to the powerplant @-@ related patents of 3 December . A group of modern @-@ day Romanian investigators led by Dan Antoniu , having examined photographs from 1910 , concluded that the rotary compressor featured at the exhibition was a hybrid between the one described in the initial 30 May 1910 patent and that shown in a later patent application . They felt that the exhibition machine had a simpler director system , a different rotor with a smaller intake cone , and that the exhaust gas heat transfer system had not been implemented . According to Gérard Hartmann in his Dossiers historiques et techniques <unk> française , the propulsion system generated only 170 N ( 17 kgf ; 38 lbf ) of thrust , and to generate enough thrust for the aircraft to take off ( estimated by Coandă at 240 N ( 24 kgf ; 54 lbf ) ) Coandă would have had to spin the " turbine " ( the rotary compressor ) at a speed of 7 @,@ 000 rpm with the risk of it exploding . This was not tried , but Hartmann concluded that the experiment proved that the solution worked perfectly . 
 Henri Mirguet writing for L 'Aérophile magazine in January 1912 , recalled the previous exhibition 's machine as the " chief attraction " of the 1910 salon . He wrote that Coandă answered his " pressing — and indiscreet — questions " about the turbo @-@ propulseur @-@ powered aircraft at that earlier exhibit , telling him that the machine had attained a speed of 112 kilometres per hour ( 70 mph ) during several " flight tests " , an improbable answer about which Mirguet " reserved judgment " , waiting for confirmation that never materialised .

 The additional turbo @-@ propulseur patent application 13 @.@ 502 , dated 3 December 1910 , was implemented on a double @-@ seat motorised sled commissioned by Cyril Vladimirovich , Grand Duke of Russia . With the help of Despujols , a boat maker , and the motor manufacturer Gregoire , Coandă supervised the building of a motor sled , powered by a 30 hp ( 22 kW ) Gregoire engine driving the turbo @-@ propulseur . The sled was blessed by Russian Orthodox priests at the Despujols plant near Paris on 2 December 1910 . Starting the next day , it was exhibited for two weeks at the 12th Automobile Salon of France , alongside Gregoire @-@ powered automobiles on the Gregoire stand . A number of automobile and general interest magazines published photographs or sketches of the sled . This was the second time in the autumn of 1910 that a version of Coandă 's turbo @-@ propulseur design was shown at the Grand Palais of Paris . One of the periodicals reported an expected speed of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) , but no account exists of the sled being tested . 
 Coandă continued to work on the Coandă @-@ 1910 project at the beginning of 1911 , aiming to improve stability , increase the power of the turbo @-@ propulseur , and to implement airfoil improvements . He applied for new patents for aerodynamic investigations and improvements of the Coandă @-@ 1910 . Coandă described a different , more sturdy system for the attachment of the wings , which also enabled changes in the angle of attack and the centre of gravity . He aimed to obtain more power from the propulsion system , and design drawings show the arrangement of two air @-@ cooled rotary engines on the sides of the fuselage . The placement of the engines indicates that Coandă did not intend to inject fuel into the jet stream and ignite it as the cooling of the engines would have been compromised . The patent was annotated with an additional claim on 19 July 1911 which brought significant changes including the addition of retractable landing gear with dampers inside aerodynamic fairings with skids , removal of the horizontal stabiliser , a supporting surface was provided for each engine and their accessories were covered to improve aerodynamics . Though Coandă continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms , Antoniu believes that Coandă never implemented a practical solution because of the lack of funds . In May 1911 Coandă filed English @-@ language patents on the turbo @-@ propulseur design in the United Kingdom and the United States , as well as a second French @-@ language patent filed in Switzerland , and he described it for the 1911 publication of L <unk> de l 'Air . 
 The very expensive project of 1910 , costing Coandă about one million francs , left him with limited funds . The possibility of a new contract with the French government lead Coandă to build the Coandă @-@ 1911 . He wished to win an army @-@ organised competition at Reims in October , one that required two engines in each aircraft as a fail @-@ safe strategy . At the third aviation salon in Paris 1911 , Coandă displayed a scale model of the aircraft which used two Gnome rotary engines mounted back to back , connected by a bevel gear to a single two @-@ bladed propeller . The strange combination of two engines connected to one propeller was originally intended to drive a new turbine , but Coandă was unable to fund one . During trials the assembly did not provide enough traction and a four @-@ bladed propeller was ordered . The mounting support of the engines , initially intended for a jet propulsion version , was not adequate for the new configuration so the forward chassis had to be modified . Henri Mirguet writing for L 'Aérophile magazine in January 1912 said that the new 1911 aircraft retained the fuselage , the frame and the wing of Coandă 's 1910 design , but did not keep the turbo @-@ propulseur or " the wooden <unk> surface including the forward longitudinal ribs " . The aircraft was flown on 21 October 1911 , but with modest results as the latest modifications , especially those related to the powerplant , did not compensate for the increased total weight of the aircraft . At the military contest , it did not meet the requirements for independent operation of each engine . 
 Following the 1911 exhibition , at the personal request of Sir George White , Coandă moved to the United Kingdom to take a position as chief engineer or chief designer at British and Colonial Aeroplane Company for a few years . In the next four decades Coandă worked on a great variety of inventions . During World War II he revived his earlier turbo @-@ propulseur engine when he was contracted by the German Army in late 1942 to develop an air propulsion system for military ambulance snow sleds much like the one made for the Russian Grand Duke . The German contract concluded after one year , yielding no plans for production . Though Coandă had experimented with a variety of nozzles , and said that he had achieved a degree of success , no turbojet @-@ engine @-@ style fuel injection or combustion in the air stream was attempted . 
 Coandă and his 1910 aircraft were absent from much of aviation literature of the day . None of the annual issues of Jane 's All the World 's Aircraft ever mentioned the Coandă @-@ 1910 or its turbo @-@ propulseur powerplant . As well , the Soviet engineer Nikolai <unk> made no mention of Coandă at all in his exhaustive nine @-@ volume encyclopaedia on jet and rocket engines , written in the late 1920s and early ' 30s .

 At the beginning of the jet age , when the potential of reactive engines was recognised , a number of histories of the jet engine were written . A once @-@ classified Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory and Jet Propulsion Laboratory study completed in 1946 described the Coandă @-@ 1910 as " probably not flown " but featuring " a mechanical jet propulsion device with a centrifugal blower " , one in which heat from the Clerget piston engine " furnished auxiliary jet propulsion . " In the editorial lead to their 1946 article on Coandă 's " Augmented Flow " , Flight terms it , " scarcely a jet " . In the same year Geoffrey G. Smith chronicled technological development in his book Gas Turbines and Jet Propulsion for Aircraft , but did not mention Coandă . 
 In 1950 's l 'aviation d <unk> et des temps <unk> , the authors assert that Coandă flew the first jet aircraft at Issy @-@ les @-@ <unk> for 30 metres ( 100 ft ) , ending with a crash . In 1953 , Flight 's treatment of aircraft in the 50 years since the Wright brothers ' flight included the Coandă @-@ 1910 " ducted fan " and said of Coandă that he " believes that he ' took off for a few feet , then came down hurriedly and broke two teeth ' " , quoting J.W. Adderley 's 1952 letter to the editor of Flight after Adderley 's discussion with Coandă in Paris at the end of World War II . Adderley said he " can definitely confirm that the power unit was of the ducted @-@ fan type , similar in basic principles to the Caproni @-@ Campini aircraft of the 1930s " ( referring to the Caproni Campini <unk> ) . 
 In the early 1950s Coandă began to claim that he had flown his 1910 aircraft himself , and that the 1910 powerplant was the first motorjet , using fuel injection and combustion to create its thrust . In 1955 and 1956 , a number of aviation articles presented the Coandă version of 1910 events . He said he took off and crashed in December 1910 in the presence of aircraft makers Louis Charles Breguet and Gabriel Voisin . Coandă himself spoke on the subject , notably before the Wings Club at New York 's Biltmore Hotel on 18 January 1956 where he said " I intended to inject fuel into the air stream which would be ignited by the exhaust gases also channelled through the same circular vent " , implying that he never finished the powerplant . Martin Caidin wrote " The Coanda Story " for the May 1956 issue of Flying , based on a personal interview . For his article " He Flew in 1910 " , René Aubrey interviewed Coandă and wrote a contradictory story in the September 1956 Royal Air Force Flying Review , saying that Coandă had flown his unusual aircraft on 16 December 1910 , that fuel was certainly injected , and that it was " the first jet flight in the world " . In Aubrey 's relation of the interview , the aircraft stalled after take @-@ off , throwing Coandă clear , and " gently collapsed to the ground " where it burned . Aubrey wrote that the aircraft engine was " designed by a friend to Coandă 's specification " , and that its burning exhaust was " directed below and to each side of the fuselage , which was protected by asbestos in vulnerable places . " 
 In Jet Age <unk> of 1956 , Coandă himself published an article entitled " The First Jet Flight " . He submitted the same text that Caidin had written for Flying in May : 
 " In December , we brought the airplane out of its hangar at Issy @-@ les @-@ Moulineaux and , after a bit of coaxing , started the motor . I must admit that I was never a very outstanding pilot . I always seemed unable to shake off a vague apprehension and , that morning , in addition to my usual uneasiness , I was rather excited . I climbed into the cockpit , accelerated the motor , and felt the power from the jet thrust straining the plane forward . I gave the signal to remove the wheel blocks , and the plane started moving slowly ahead . I had anticipated that I would not attempt to fly today , but would make only ground tests on the small field at Issy @-@ les @-@ Moulineaux . The controls seemed too loose to me , so I injected fuel into the turbine . Too much ! In a moment I was surrounded by flames ! I had to cut back and reduce my power quickly . I worked the throttle and the flames subsided . Only then did I have opportunity to lift my head . I saw that the plane had gained speed , and that the walls of the ancient fortifications bordering the field were lunging toward me . I pulled back on the stick , only much too hard . In a moment the plane was airborne , lunging upward at a steep angle . I was flying — I felt the plane tipping — then slipping down on one wing . Instinctively , I cut the gas with my left hand and the jet fuel with my right . The next thing I knew , I found myself thrown free of the plane , which slowly came down , and burst into flames . It was impossible to determine from the wreckage whether the celluloid or the fuel was the cause of the fire . But the test was over . I had flown the first jet airplane . " 
 A collection of aviation stories was published in 1957 by Major Victor Houart , a friend of Coandă 's , who wrote that he was an eyewitness the day Coandă flew and crashed . One chapter of the book describes how Houart , together with a group of French dragoons , watched as Coandă taxied twice around the airfield , lifted off to avoid the ruins of an old fortification wall , started flames from the engine by applying too much power , and was thrown from the aircraft the moment it hit the wall , with Coandă " not badly hurt " . Houart 's version put the fuel tank in the overhead wing , which was metal . In further statements , Coandă said that his 1910 aircraft had movable leading edge slots , retractable landing gear and a fuel supply which was held in the overhead wing to reduce fuselage profile and thus drag . In 1965 , Coandă presented a set of drawings , photographs and specifications of the 1910 aircraft to the National Air and Space Museum ( NASM ) , prepared by Huyck Corporation and received by Director S. Paul Johnston and early aviation curator Louis Casey . 
 Rocket engineer G. Harry Stine worked alongside Coandă from 1961 to 1965 at Huyck Corporation , and interviewed him in 1962 . In 1967 , the magazine Flying printed an account written by Stine , which described the landing gear as retracting into the lower wing , with the fuel tank hidden in the upper wing . Stine wrote that Coandă flew on 10 December 1910 , and described the heat from the " two jet exhausts " as being " too much for me " after the powerplant was mounted in the aircraft . In the 1980s after Coandă 's death , Stine wrote a magazine article and a book mentioning the 1910 aircraft , including new details such as the name of master mechanic Pierre Clerget as the friend who helped build the turbo @-@ propulseur . Stine 's recounting of the 10 December flight included the group of eyewitness French dragoons , asbestos heat shields and metal deflector plates aft of the engine , intended taxiing with unintentional flight , a steep climb with a stall , Coandă thrown clear , and the aircraft crashing to the ground , burning . Stine gave his assessment that " Coanda 's <unk> had elements of a true jet " , but that the patent application had no indication of the " critical stage — injection of fuel into the compressed air " . He wrote that " although there were several jet @-@ propelled aircraft in existence at an early time — the 1910 Coanda Jet and the 1938 Caproni Campini <unk> — the first pure jet aircraft flight was made in Germany in 1938 " . 
 In 1965 , Historian Emeritus Paul E. Garber of the NASM interviewed Coandă , who related that the December 1910 flight was no accident , that he had seated himself in the cockpit intending to test five factors : aircraft structure , the engine , the wing lift , the balance of controls , and the aerodynamics . He said that the heat from the engine was " fantastic " , but that he placed mica sheets and deflecting plates to direct the jet blast away from the wooden fuselage . Garber wrote that as Coandă 's aircraft began to move forward and rise from the ground , " the exhaust flame , instead of fanning outward , curved inward and ignited the aircraft . " In this interview Coandă said that he brought the aircraft back to earth under control , but the landing was " abrupt " and he was thrown clear of the airframe which was consumed completely by flame , the engine reduced to " a few handfuls of white powder . "

 In 1960 , Charles Harvard Gibbs @-@ Smith , aviation historian at the Science Museum in London , reacted to the mid @-@ 1950s assertion that Coandă built and flew the first jet engine aircraft . Gibbs @-@ Smith wrote that " there has recently arisen some controversy about this machine , designed by the Rumanian @-@ born and French @-@ domiciled Henri Coanda , which was exhibited at the Paris salon in October 1910 . Until recently it has been accepted as an all @-@ wood sesquiplane , with cantilever wings , powered by a 50 hp Clerget engine driving a ' turbo @-@ propulseur ' in the form of a large but simple ducted air fan . This fan was fitted right across the machine 's nose and the cowling covered the nose and part of the engine : the resulting ' jet ' of plain air was to propel the aeroplane . " He wrote that " no claims that it flew , or was even tested , were made at the time " , and that the story of it flying suddenly appeared in the 1950s — the aircraft was thus " disinterred from its obscurity . " He wrote that the airfield at Issy @-@ les @-@ Moulineaux , a former military exercise ground where the test supposedly took place , was under the constant observation of the French Army who owned it , by French aviation reporters and photographers , and by aviation experts from other countries . He said that the airfield was the " most famous , most used , most observed , and most reported @-@ on ' airfield ' in Paris " , and that all events , let alone an exciting crash and destruction by fire , would have been carried in local papers and described in military reports , but no contemporary accounts exist of the Coandă @-@ 1910 being tested , flown or destroyed . Gibbs @-@ Smith countered the Coandă assertions point by point , saying that the aircraft did not have a retractable undercarriage , did not have leading or trailing edge wing slots , did not have a fuel tank overhead in the wing , and did not have fuel injected into any turbine . Gibbs @-@ Smith pointed out that the pilot would have been killed by the heat if any combustion had been initiated in the engine 's air stream . 
 In 1970 Gibbs @-@ Smith wrote another account of the Coanda @-@ 1910 , using much the same phrasing as in 1960 : 
 " Another unsuccessful , but prophetic , machine was the Coanda biplane ( strictly speaking a sesquiplane ) exhibited at the Paris Salon in October . It was of all @-@ wood construction , with fully cantilevered wings — which did not look very robust — and an Antoinette @-@ like fuselage with obliquely cruciform tail @-@ unit ; it was equipped with a reaction propulsion unit consisting of a 50 hp Clerget engine driving a large ducted fan in front of it , the latter enclosed in a cowling which covered the nose of the machine and part of the engine : the fan was a simple air @-@ fan driving back the air to form the propulsive ' jet ' . Although inevitably earth @-@ bound , this aircraft stands as the first full @-@ size attempt at a jet @-@ propelled aeroplane . " 
 In 2010 , Antoniu wrote that he thought Gibbs @-@ Smith speculated on the basis of the evidence of absence that the aircraft was never tested or flown , but that Gibbs @-@ Smith did not find any concrete evidence to support his position . Similarly , Antoniu was unable to find concrete proof of a test flight . Antoniu also wrote that Gibbs @-@ Smith did not check the French patents claimed by Coandă in 1910 and 1911 , describing the retractable gear , leading edge wing slot and upper wing fuel tank , and that he did not see photographs from private collections demonstrating aspects about which he wrote . 
 In 1980 , NASM historian Frank H. Winter examined the 1965 drawings and specifications Coandă prepared while at Huyck Corporation and wrote an article about Coandă 's claim : " There is a wholly new description of the inner workings of the machine that does not occur in any of the accounts given [ in the 1910s ] and which defies all of the patent specifications . " He said Coandă told various conflicting stories about his claimed 1910 flight , and that Coandă produced a set of altered drawings as proof of his claims : 
 " The differences between this version of Coanda 's story and his earlier one are marked and hardly need to be pointed out ; though the obvious ones are : the planned versus the completely accidental and unintentional flight ; the immediate flight versus the busy taxiing about the field ; Coanda being thrown from the plane after it stalled versus Coanda pitched forward after landing , and so on . Apart from his personal recollections , Henri Coanda also bestowed upon the museum some drawings and illustrations of his turbo @-@ propulseur . The drawings , purporting to show internal details of the machine , are unfortunately modern . That is to say , they were obviously executed in the 1960s , not in 1910 or 1911 ; worse , the fuel injection outlet tubes into the aft end of the turbine seems to be an even later addition to the original drawings . In brief , the drawings by themselves do not constitute evidence in Coanda 's claim . " 
 In his article , Winter wondered why Coandă did not add the novel feature of fuel injection and air stream combustion to his May 1911 patent applications if that feature had been present during his supposed flying experience five months earlier . Rather , Winter noted that the August 1910 patent filings in French were essentially the same as the May 1911 ones in English , and that all the descriptions were applicable to air or water flowing through the device , meaning that the patents could not possibly include fuel combustion in the jet stream . He also noted that no mention was made in the early patents of asbestos or mica heat shields , or of any fuel injection or combustion . 
 While looking through aviation periodicals and Paris newspapers reporting for the month of December 1910 , Winter found that there was a spell of bad weather at Issy during which no flying took place . This situation occurred mid @-@ month , the period covering the conflicting dates ( 10 and 16 December ) that Coandă said his aircraft was tested , flown and crashed . In their regular " Foreign Aviation News " column , Flight magazine reported that the " blank period " of inclement weather at Issy ended on the 19th when Guillaume <unk> tested a monoplane made by Armand Deperdussin . Other aircraft tests and piloting activities were listed , with no mention of Coandă or his machine . 
 Winter found that Camille ( or Cosimo ) Canovetti , an Italian civil and aviation engineer , had been working on a turbo @-@ propulseur @-@ style aviation engine before Coandă , and had attempted to show an aircraft with such an engine at the Aviation Exposition in Milan in 1909 . Canovetti took out patents on his machine in 1909 , and more in 1910 . Canovetti wrote in 1911 that the 1910 appearance of the Coandă engine " called general attention " to designs like his .

 Modern reference books about aviation history represent the Coandă @-@ 1910 in various ways , if they mention the machine or the inventor at all . Some acknowledge Coandă as the discoverer of the Coandă effect but give Hans von Ohain the honour of designing the first jet engine to power an aircraft in manned flight , and Frank Whittle the honour of completing and patenting the first jet engine capable of such flight . In their 1994 book American Aviation , authors Joe Christy and LeRoy Cook state that Coandă 's 1910 aircraft was the first jet . 
 Aviation author Bill Gunston changed his mind two years after publishing a 1993 book in which he gave Coandă credit for the first jet engine . Gunston 's 1995 description began : " Romanian Henri Coanda built a biplane with a Clerget inline piston engine which , instead of turning a propeller , drove a centrifugal compressor blowing air to the rear . The thrust was said to be 220 kilograms [ 490 lb ] , a figure the author disbelieves . On 10 December 1910 the aircraft thus powered inadvertently became airborne , crashed and burned . Often called ' a turbine aeroplane ' , this was of no more significance than the Campini aircraft mentioned later , and Coanda wisely decided to switch to a propeller . " In his publication of 1998 , World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines : All major aircraft power plants , from the Wright brothers to the present day , Gunston did not include Coanda ; nor did he include Coanda in 2005 's Jane 's Aero @-@ Engines or 2006 's World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines . 
 Walter J. Boyne , director of the National Air and Space Museum and a prolific aviation author , mentions Coandă in passing a few times in his works . Boyne discusses Coandă briefly in one of his books , The Leading Edge : " Professor Henri Coanda , whose scientific work was impeccable , designed and built a jet aircraft in 1910 ; it , like Martin 's Kitten [ the Martin KF @-@ 1 biplane ] , was superbly built and technically advanced — and could not fly . " In a later magazine article sidebar , Boyne described more details : " Romanian inventor Henri Coanda attempted to fly a primitive jet aircraft in 1910 , using a four @-@ cylinder internal combustion engine to drive a compressor at 4 @,@ 000 revolutions per minute . It was equipped with what today might be called an afterburner , producing an estimated 500 pounds [ 2 @.@ 3 kN or 230 kgf ] of thrust . Countless loyal Coanda fans insist that the airplane flew . Others say it merely crashed . " 
 In 1980 and 1993 , Jane 's Encyclopedia of Aviation included an entry on the 1910 aircraft , calling it the " Coanda turbine " and describing it as " the world 's first jet @-@ propelled aircraft to fly " . In 2003 , Winter co @-@ authored a book with fellow NASM curator F. Robert van der Linden : 100 Years of Flight : A Chronicle of Aerospace History , 1903 – 2003 . In the book the Coandă @-@ 1910 is described as an unsuccessful ducted fan aircraft lacking documentation to substantiate any flight test . 
 Citing Carl A. Brown 's 1985 A History of Aviation , Tim Brady , the Dean of Aviation at Embry – Riddle Aeronautical University , wrote in 2000 : " the development of the jet is , broadly , the story of three men : Henri Coanda , Sir Frank Whittle , and Pabst von Ohain ... " His description of Coandă 's disputed test flight agreed that fuel injection and combustion had been initiated in the rotary compressor 's vent , with the novel detail that the aircraft " flew for about a thousand feet [ 300 m ] before crashing into a wall . " In 1990 at the 24th Symposium of the International Academy of Astronautics , one of the papers presented included this sentence : " It is to Henri Coanda ( 1886 – 1972 ) , a world famous inventor and pioneer of jet flight , that space engineering owes — beside one of the first model planes provided with a rocket engine ( 1905 ) — the construction and engine experiment of the first jet aircraft , the ' Coanda @-@ 1910 ' . " In 2007 in his popular book Extreme Aircraft , Ron Miller wrote that the powerplant in the Coandă @-@ 1910 was one of the " earliest attempts " at a jet engine , but was unsuccessful — it was " incapable of actual flight " , unlike the engines designed by Whittle and Ohain . The question of the Coandă @-@ 1910 being the first jet aircraft does not appear to be resolved , supporting Stine 's view : " Whether Henri Coanda built the first true jet will probably be argued interminably . " 
 In the 2000s , Dan Antoniu and other Romanian aviation experts investigated existing photographs of the Coandă @-@ 1910 , leading them to believe that the aircraft presented at the exhibition was not finished , that it was exhibited with many improvisations . Antoniu published Henri Coandă and his technical work during 1906 – 1918 , a 2010 book in which he said that the unfinished state of the aircraft led to Coandă filing several extra patents and starting a new series of studies with the aim of making the machine airworthy . For instance , Antoniu wrote that the exhaust pipes of the <unk> engine appeared free ; there were no devices to redirect exhaust gases to the turbine as described in the patent , and there were no heat shields for crew protection . As well , the central attachment of the tubular struts holding the wings to the fuselage , with mere collars secured with screws , was judged by Antoniu as appearing potentially unsafe during take @-@ off or landing because of the " considerable loads on the struts " . The X @-@ shaped empennage was covered at high angles by the horizontal stabiliser making it unusable , and any high @-@ speed taxi would put the machine in danger of a nose @-@ over .

 A full @-@ size replica of the Coandă @-@ 1910 , built in 2001 , is displayed in Bucharest at the National Military Museum , and a scale model is displayed in the French Air and Space Museum at Paris – Le Bourget Airport . At the site of the historic Issy @-@ les @-@ Moulineaux airfield , a large plaque lists the three pioneers of flight most closely associated with the airfield : Louis Blériot , Alberto Santos @-@ Dumont and Henri Farman . Later , a plaque honouring Coandă and Romanian aviation engineer Traian Vuia was placed on a nearby building under the auspices of the mayor of Issy @-@ les @-@ Moulineaux , L <unk> de France , and the Romanian Association for Aviation History . 
 Construction on a full @-@ sized functional replica of the plane began in March 2010 at Craiova , Romania , by a team of engineers and former test pilots from <unk> Craiova . The replica is based on plans that Coandă reworked in 1965 because the 1910 plans were lost . It uses metal for the fuselage rather than wood , and its intended engine is a true jet , the <unk> M @-@ 701 , made for the 1960s @-@ era Aero L @-@ 29 <unk> military trainer . 
 In October 2010 the National Bank of Romania issued a commemorative silver coin for the centennial of the building of the first jet aircraft . The 10 @-@ leu piece is intended for coin collectors , with the official purchase price set at 220 leu . It represents the aircraft on the obverse side and a portrait of Coandă on the reverse , including Romanian words which translate to " first jet aircraft " . The same month the philatelic section of the Romanian Post , <unk> , produced a limited edition philatelic folder and a stamp commemorating the centennial of jet aircraft . The stamp presents a modern internal schema of the Coandă @-@ 1910 , a drawing of the injectors and burners , and a quote from Gustave Eiffel : " This boy was born 30 if not 50 years too early " . At the European Parliament in December , president Jerzy Buzek opened a centennial exhibition celebrating the building and testing of the Coandă @-@ 1910 .

 Dartmouth College ( / <unk> / DART @-@ <unk> ) is a private Ivy League research university in Hanover , New Hampshire , United States . Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock , Dartmouth is one of the nine colonial colleges founded before the American Revolution . 
 Following a liberal arts curriculum , the university provides undergraduate instruction in 40 academic departments and interdisciplinary programs including 57 majors in the humanities , social sciences , natural sciences , and engineering , and enables students to design specialized majors and minors or engage in dual degree programs . Dartmouth comprises five constituent schools : the original undergraduate college , the Geisel School of Medicine , the Thayer School of Engineering , the Tuck School of Business , and the School of Graduate and Advanced Studies . With an undergraduate enrollment of 4 @,@ 307 and a total student enrollment of 6 @,@ 350 , Dartmouth is the smallest university in the Ivy League . 
 Dartmouth 's 269 @-@ acre campus is in the rural Upper Valley region of New Hampshire . The university functions on a quarter system , operating year @-@ round on four ten @-@ week academic terms . Dartmouth is known for its strong Greek culture and wide array of enduring campus traditions . Its 34 varsity sports teams compete <unk> in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I. 
 Dartmouth has produced many prominent alumni , including 62 Rhodes Scholars , 13 Pulitzer Prize winners , over 164 members of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives , 22 U.S. Governors , 10 billionaire graduates , 8 U.S. Cabinet officials , 3 Nobel Prize laureates , 2 U.S. Supreme Court justices , and a U.S. Vice President . Other notable alumni include numerous MacArthur Genius fellows , Fulbright and Marshall scholarship recipients , CEOs and founders of Fortune 500 companies , high @-@ ranking U.S. diplomats , scholars in academia , literary and media figures , professional athletes , and Olympic medalists . 
 = = History = = 
 Dartmouth was founded by Eleazar Wheelock , a Congregational minister from Columbia , Connecticut , who had previously sought to establish a school to train Native Americans as Christian missionaries . Wheelock 's ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with Mohegan Indian Samson Occom . Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from 1743 to 1747 , and later moved to Long Island to preach to the Montauks . 
 Wheelock founded Moor 's Indian Charity School in 1755 . The Charity School proved somewhat successful , but additional funding was necessary to continue school 's operations , and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money . Occom , accompanied by the Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker , traveled to England in 1766 to raise money from churches . With these funds , they established a trust to help Wheelock . The head of the trust was a Methodist named William Legge , 2nd Earl of Dartmouth . 
 Although the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School , Wheelock initially had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution , primarily because its location was far from tribal territories . In seeking to expand the school into a college , Wheelock relocated it to Hanover , in the Province of New Hampshire . The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter . The Royal Governor of New Hampshire , John Wentworth , provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13 , 1769 , issued the charter in the name of King George III establishing the College . That charter created a college " for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading , writing & all parts of Learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & <unk> Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences and also of English Youth and any others . " The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable use of the Charity School 's unspent trust funds . Named for William Legge , 2nd Earl of Dartmouth — an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock 's earlier efforts but who , in fact , opposed creation of the College and never donated to it — Dartmouth is the nation 's ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under Colonial rule . The College granted its first degrees in 1771 . 
 Given the limited success of the Charity School , however , Wheelock intended his new college as one primarily for whites . Occom , disappointed with Wheelock 's departure from the school 's original goal of Indian Christianization , went on to form his own community of New England Indians called <unk> Indians in New York . 
 In 1819 , Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic Dartmouth College case , which challenged New Hampshire 's 1816 attempt to amend the college 's royal charter to make the school a public university . An institution called Dartmouth University occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817 , though the college continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby . Daniel Webster , an alumnus of the class of 1801 , presented the College 's case to the Supreme Court , which found the amendment of Dartmouth 's charter to be an illegal impairment of a contract by the state and reversed New Hampshire 's takeover of the college . Webster concluded his peroration with the famous words : " It is , Sir , as I have said , a small college . And yet there are those who love it . " 
 In 1866 , the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts was incorporated in Hanover , in connection with Dartmouth College . The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth and was directed by Dartmouth 's president . The new college was moved to Durham , New Hampshire , in 1891 , and later became known as the University of New Hampshire . 
 Dartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century . Prior to this period , the college had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded . Under President William Jewett Tucker ( 1893 – 1909 ) , Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities , faculty , and the student body , following large endowments such as the $ 10 @,@ 000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor John <unk> . 20 new structures replaced antiquated buildings , while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold . Tucker is often credited for having " refounded Dartmouth " and bringing it into national prestige . 
 Presidents Ernest Fox Nichols ( 1909 – 16 ) and Ernest Martin Hopkins ( 1916 – 45 ) continued Tucker 's trend of modernization , further improving campus facilities and introducing selective admissions in the 1920s . John Sloan Dickey , serving as president from 1945 until 1970 , strongly emphasized the liberal arts , particularly public policy and international relations . During World War II , Dartmouth was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V @-@ 12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a navy commission . 
 In 1970 , longtime professor of mathematics and computer science John George Kemeny became president of Dartmouth . Kemeny oversaw several major changes at the college . Dartmouth , previously serving as a men 's institution , began admitting women as full @-@ time students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy . At about the same time , the college adopted its " Dartmouth Plan " of academic scheduling , permitting the student body to increase in size within the existing facilities . In 1988 , Dartmouth 's alma mater song 's lyrics changed from " Men of Dartmouth " to " Dear old Dartmouth " . 
 During the 1990s , the college saw a major academic overhaul under President James O. Freedman and a controversial ( and ultimately unsuccessful ) 1999 initiative to encourage the school 's single @-@ sex Greek houses to go coed . The first decade of the 21st century saw the commencement of the $ 1 @.@ 3 billion Campaign for the Dartmouth Experience , the largest capital fundraising campaign in the college 's history , which surpassed $ 1 billion in 2008 . The mid- and late first decade of the 21st century have also seen extensive campus construction , with the erection of two new housing complexes , full renovation of two dormitories , and a forthcoming dining hall , life sciences center , and visual arts center . In 2004 , Booz Allen Hamilton selected Dartmouth College as a model of institutional endurance " whose record of endurance has had implications and benefits for all American organizations , both academic and commercial , " citing Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward and Dartmouth 's successful self @-@ reinvention in the late 19th century . 
 Since the election of a number of petition @-@ nominated trustees to the Board of Trustees starting in 2004 , the role of alumni in Dartmouth governance has been the subject of ongoing conflict . President James Wright announced his retirement in February 2008 and was replaced by Harvard University professor and physician Jim Yong Kim on July 1 , 2009 . 
 In May 2010 Dartmouth joined the Matariki Network of Universities ( <unk> ) together with Durham University ( UK ) , Queen 's University ( Canada ) , University of Otago ( New Zealand ) , University of Tübingen ( Germany ) , University of Western Australia ( Australia ) and Uppsala University ( Sweden ) . 
 Dartmouth 's close association and involvement in the development of the downhill skiing industry is featured in the 2010 book Passion for Skiing as well as the 2013 documentary based on the book Passion for Snow . 
 = = Academics = = 
 Dartmouth , a liberal arts institution , offers a four @-@ year Bachelor of Arts and <unk> @-@ accredited Bachelor of Engineering degree to undergraduate students . The college has 39 academic departments offering 56 major programs , while students are free to design special majors or engage in dual majors . In 2008 , the most popular majors were economics , government , history , psychological and brain sciences , English , biology , and engineering sciences . The Government Department , whose prominent professors include Stephen Brooks , Richard Ned <unk> , and William <unk> , was ranked the top solely undergraduate political science program in the world by researchers at the London School of Economics in 2003 . The Economics Department , whose prominent professors include David Blanchflower and Andrew <unk> , also holds the distinction as the top @-@ ranked bachelor 's @-@ only economics program in the world . 
 In order to graduate , a student must complete 35 total courses , eight to ten of which are typically part of a chosen major program . Other requirements for graduation include the completion of ten " distributive requirements " in a variety of academic fields , proficiency in a foreign language , and completion of a writing class and first @-@ year seminar in writing . Many departments offer honors programs requiring students seeking that distinction to engage in " independent , sustained work , " culminating in the production of a thesis . In addition to the courses offered in Hanover , Dartmouth offers 57 different off @-@ campus programs , including Foreign Study Programs , Language Study Abroad programs , and Exchange Programs . 
 Through the Graduate Studies program , Dartmouth grants doctorate and master 's degrees in 19 Arts & Sciences graduate programs . Although the first graduate degree , a PhD in classics , was awarded in 1885 , many of the current PhD programs have only existed since the 1960s . Furthermore , Dartmouth is home to three professional schools : the Geisel School of Medicine ( established 1797 ) , Thayer School of Engineering ( 1867 ) — which also serves as the undergraduate department of engineering sciences — and Tuck School of Business ( 1900 ) . With these professional schools and graduate programs , conventional American usage would accord Dartmouth the label of " Dartmouth University " ; however , because of historical and nostalgic reasons ( such as Dartmouth College v. Woodward ) , the school uses the name " Dartmouth College " to refer to the entire institution . 
 Dartmouth employs a total of 607 tenured or tenure @-@ track faculty members , including the highest proportion of female tenured professors among the Ivy League universities . Faculty members have been at the forefront of such major academic developments as the Dartmouth Conferences , the Dartmouth Time Sharing System , Dartmouth BASIC , and Dartmouth ALGOL 30 . In 2005 , sponsored project awards to Dartmouth faculty research amounted to $ 169 million . 
 Dartmouth serves as the host institution of the University Press of New England , a university press founded in 1970 that is supported by a consortium of schools that also includes Brandeis University , the University of New Hampshire , Northeastern University , Tufts University and the University of Vermont .

 Dartmouth guarantees to meet 100 % of the demonstrated need of every admitted student who applies for financial aid at the time of admission . Dartmouth practices need @-@ blind admissions for all applicants who are U.S. citizens , permanent residents , and undocumented students in the U.S. These applicants are admitted to the college without regard to their financial circumstances . For international students , financial need is taken into consideration as one of many factors at the time of admission . At Dartmouth , free tuition is provided for students from families with total incomes of $ 100 @,@ 000 or less and possessing typical assets . In 2015 , $ 88 @.@ 8 million in need @-@ based scholarships were awarded to Dartmouth students . 
 = = = The Dartmouth Plan = = = 
 Dartmouth functions on a quarter system , operating year @-@ round on four ten @-@ week academic terms . The Dartmouth Plan ( or simply " D @-@ Plan " ) is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student 's academic year . All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall , winter , and spring terms of their freshman and senior years , as well as the summer term of their sophomore year . However , students may petition to alter this plan so that they may be off during their freshman , senior , or sophomore summer terms . During all terms , students are permitted to choose between studying on @-@ campus , studying at an off @-@ campus program , or taking a term off for vacation , outside internships , or research projects . The typical course load is three classes per term , and students will generally enroll in classes for 12 total terms over the course of their academic career . 
 The D @-@ Plan was instituted in the early 1970s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates . It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations , and has been described as " a way to put 4 @,@ 000 students into 3 @,@ 000 beds . " Although new dormitories have been built since , the number of students has also increased and the D @-@ Plan remains in effect . It was modified in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce the problems of lack of social and academic continuity . 
 = = = Board of Trustees = = = 
 Dartmouth is governed by a Board of Trustees comprising the college president ( ex officio ) , the state governor ( ex officio ) , 13 trustees nominated and elected by the board ( called " charter trustees " ) , and eight trustees nominated by alumni and elected by the board ( " alumni trustees " ) . The nominees for alumni trustee are determined by a poll of the members of the Association of Alumni of Dartmouth College , selecting from among names put forward by the Alumni Council or by alumni petition . 
 Although the board elected its members from the two sources of nominees in equal proportions between 1891 and 2007 , the board decided in 2007 to add several new members , all charter trustees . In the controversy that followed the decision , the Association of Alumni filed a lawsuit , although it later withdrew the action . In 2008 , the Board added five new charter trustees . 
 = = Campus = = 
 Dartmouth College is situated in the rural town of Hanover , New Hampshire , located in the Upper Valley along the Connecticut River in New England . Its 269 @-@ acre ( 1 @.@ 09 km2 ) campus is centered on a 5 @-@ acre ( 2 ha ) " Green " , a former field of pine trees cleared in 1771 . Dartmouth is the largest private landowner of the town of Hanover , and its total landholdings and facilities are worth an estimated $ 434 million . In addition to its campus in Hanover , Dartmouth owns 4 @,@ 500 acres ( 18 km2 ) of Mount Moosilauke in the White Mountains and a 27 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 110 km2 ) tract of land in northern New Hampshire known as the Second College Grant . 
 Dartmouth 's campus buildings vary in age from Wentworth and Thornton Halls of the 1820s ( the oldest surviving buildings constructed by the college ) to new dormitories and mathematics facilities completed in 2006 . Most of Dartmouth 's buildings are designed in the Georgian American colonial style , a theme which has been preserved in recent architectural additions . The College has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus , earning it the grade of A- from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card 2008 . 
 A notable feature of the Dartmouth campus is its many trees which ( despite Dutch elm disease ) include some 200 American elms . 
 = = = Academic facilities = = = 
 The college 's creative and performing arts facility is the Hopkins Center for the Arts ( " the Hop " ) . Opened in 1962 , the Hop houses the College 's drama , music , film , and studio arts departments , as well as a woodshop , pottery studio , and jewelry studio which are open for use by students and faculty . The building was designed by the famed architect Wallace Harrison , who would later design the similar @-@ looking façade of Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center . Its facilities include two theaters and one 900 @-@ seat auditorium . The Hop is also the location of all student mailboxes ( " Hinman boxes " ) and the Courtyard Café dining facility . The Hop is connected to the Hood Museum of Art , arguably North America 's oldest museum in continuous operation , and the Loew Auditorium , where films are screened . 
 In addition to its 19 graduate programs in the arts and sciences , Dartmouth is home to three separate graduate schools . The Geisel School of Medicine is located in a complex on the north side of campus and includes laboratories , classrooms , offices , and a biomedical library . The Dartmouth – Hitchcock Medical Center , located several miles to the south in Lebanon , New Hampshire , contains a 396 @-@ bed teaching hospital for the Medical School . The Thayer School of Engineering and the Tuck School of Business are both located at the end of Tuck Mall , west of the center of campus and near the Connecticut River . The Thayer School presently comprises two buildings ; Tuck has seven academic and administrative buildings , as well as several common areas . The two graduate schools share a library , the Feldberg Business & Engineering Library . 
 Dartmouth 's nine libraries are all part of the collective Dartmouth College Library , which comprises 2 @.@ 48 million volumes and 6 million total resources , including videos , maps , sound recordings , and photographs . Its specialized libraries include the Biomedical Libraries , Evans Map Room , Feldberg Business & Engineering Library , Jones Media Center , Kresge Physical Sciences Library , Paddock Music Library , Rauner Special Collections Library , and Sherman Art Library . Baker @-@ Berry Library is the main library at Dartmouth , comprising a merger of the Baker Memorial Library ( opened 1928 ) and the Berry Library ( completed 2002 ) . Located on the northern side of the Green , Baker 's 200 @-@ foot ( 61 m ) tower is an iconic symbol of the College . 
 = = = Athletic facilities = = = 
 Dartmouth 's original sports field was the Green , where students played cricket and old division football during the 19th century . Today , two of Dartmouth 's athletic facilities are located in the southeast corner of campus . The center of athletic life is the Alumni Gymnasium , which includes the Karl Michael Competition Pool and the Spaulding Pool , a state of the art fitness center , a weight room , and a 1 / 13th @-@ mile ( 123 m ) indoor track . Attached to Alumni Gymnasium is the Berry Sports Center , which contains basketball and volleyball courts ( <unk> Arena ) , as well as the Kresge Fitness Center . Behind the Alumni Gymnasium is Memorial Field , a 15 @,@ 600 @-@ seat stadium overlooking Dartmouth 's football field and track . The nearby Thompson Arena , designed by Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi and constructed in 1975 , houses Dartmouth 's ice rink . Also visible from Memorial Field is the 91 @,@ 800 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 8 @,@ 530 m2 ) Nathaniel Leverone Fieldhouse , home to the indoor track . The new softball field , Dartmouth Softball Park , was constructed in 2012 , sharing parking facilities with Thompson arena and replacing Sachem Field , located over a mile from campus , as the primary softball facility . 
 Dartmouth 's other athletic facilities in Hanover include the Friends of Dartmouth Rowing Boathouse and the old rowing house storage facility ( both located along the Connecticut River ) , the Hanover Country Club , Dartmouth 's oldest remaining athletic facility ( established in 1899 ) , and the Corey Ford Rugby Clubhouse . The college also maintains the Dartmouth <unk> , a 100 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 40 km2 ) skiing facility located over two mountains near the Hanover campus in Lyme Center , New Hampshire , that serves as the winter practice grounds for the Dartmouth ski team , which is a perennial contender for the NCAA Division I championship . 
 = = = Housing and student life facilities = = = 
 Beginning in the fall term of 2016 , Dartmouth will place all undergraduate students in one of six House communities , similar to residential colleges . Dartmouth previously had nine residential communities located throughout campus , instead of <unk> dormitories or residential colleges . The dormitories varied in design from modern to traditional Georgian styles , and room arrangements range from singles to quads and apartment suites . Since 2006 , the College has guaranteed housing for students during their freshman and sophomore years . More than 3 @,@ 000 students elect to live in housing provided by College . 
 Campus meals are served by Dartmouth Dining Services , which operates 11 dining establishments around campus . Four of them are located at the center of campus in the Class of 1953 Commons , formerly Thayer Dining Hall . 
 The Collis Center is the center of student life and programming , serving as what would be generically termed the " student union " or " campus center . " It contains a café , study space , common areas , and a number of administrative departments , including the Academic Skills Centre . Robinson Hall , next door to both Collis and Thayer , contains the offices of a number of student organizations including the Dartmouth Outing Club and The Dartmouth daily newspaper . 
 Beginning in the fall term 2016 , all undergraduate students of Dartmouth will be members of one of the following six House communities , similar to residential colleges : 
 Allen House 
 East Wheelock House 
 North Park House 
 School House 
 South House

 Dartmouth 's more than 200 student organizations and clubs cover a wide range of interests . In 2007 , the college hosted eight academic groups , 17 cultural groups , two honor societies , 30 " issue @-@ oriented " groups , 25 performing groups , 12 pre @-@ professional groups , 20 publications , and 11 recreational groups . Notable student groups include the nation 's largest and oldest collegiate outdoors club , the Dartmouth Outing Club , which includes the nationally recognized Big Green Bus ; the campus 's oldest a cappella group , The Dartmouth Aires ; the controversial conservative newspaper The Dartmouth Review ; and The Dartmouth , arguably the nation 's oldest university newspaper . The Dartmouth describes itself as " America 's Oldest College Newspaper , Founded 1799 . " 
 Partially because of Dartmouth 's rural , isolated location , the Greek system dating from the 1840s is one of the most popular social outlets for students . Dartmouth is home to 32 recognized Greek houses : 17 fraternities , 12 sororities , and three coeducational organizations . In 2007 , roughly 70 % of eligible students belonged to a Greek organization ; since 1987 , students have not been permitted to join Greek organizations until their sophomore year . Dartmouth College was among the first institutions of higher education to desegregate fraternity houses in the 1950s , and was involved in the movement to create coeducational Greek houses in the 1970s . In the early first decade of the 21st century , campus @-@ wide debate focused on a Board of Trustees recommendation that Greek organizations become " substantially coeducational " ; this attempt to change the Greek system eventually failed . The fraternities have an extensive history of hazing and alcohol abuse , leading to police raids and accusations of sexual harassment . 
 Dartmouth also has a number of secret societies , which are <unk> and alumni @-@ led organizations often focused on preserving the history of the college and initiating service projects . Most prominent among them is the Sphinx society , housed in a prominent Egyptian tomb @-@ like building near the center of campus . The Sphinx has been the subject of numerous rumors as to its facilities , practices , and membership . 
 The college has an additional classification of social / residential organizations known as undergraduate societies . 
 = = = Athletics = = = 
 Approximately 20 % of students participate in a varsity sport , and nearly 80 % participate in some form of club , varsity , intramural , or other athletics . In 2007 , Dartmouth College fielded 34 intercollegiate varsity teams : 16 for men , 16 for women , and coeducational sailing and equestrian programs . Dartmouth 's athletic teams compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Division I eight @-@ member Ivy League conference ; some teams also participate in the Eastern College Athletic Conference ( ECAC ) . As is mandatory for the members of the Ivy League , Dartmouth College does not offer athletic scholarships . In addition to the traditional American team sports ( football , basketball , baseball , and ice hockey ) , Dartmouth competes at the varsity level in many other sports including track and field , softball , squash , sailing , tennis , rowing , soccer , skiing , and lacrosse . 
 The college also offers 26 club and intramural sports such as fencing , rugby , water polo , figure skating , boxing , volleyball , ultimate frisbee , and cricket , leading to a 75 % participation rate in athletics among the undergraduate student body . The Dartmouth Fencing Team , despite being entirely self @-@ coached , won the <unk> club national championship in 2014 . The Dartmouth Men 's Rugby Team , founded in 1951 , has been ranked among the best collegiate teams in that sport , winning for example the Ivy Rugby Conference every year between 2008 and 2015 . The figure skating team won the national championship five straight times from 2004 through 2008 . In addition to the academic requirements for graduation , Dartmouth requires every undergraduate to complete a 50 @-@ yard ( 46 m ) swim and three terms of physical education . 
 = = = Native Americans at Dartmouth = = = 
 It is often pointed out that the charter of Dartmouth College , granted to Eleazar Wheelock in 1769 , proclaims that the institution was created " for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading , writing and all parts of Learning ... as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences ; and also of English Youth and any others . " However , Wheelock primarily intended the college to educate White youth , and the few Native students that attended Dartmouth experienced much difficulty in an institution ostensibly dedicated to their education . The funds for the Charity School for Native Americans that preceded Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Native American named Samson Occom , and at least some of those funds were used to help found the college . 
 The college graduated only 19 Native Americans during its first two hundred years . In 1970 , the college established Native American academic and social programs as part of a " new dedication to increasing Native American enrollment . " Since then , Dartmouth has graduated over 1 @,@ 000 Native American students from over 200 different tribes , more than the other seven Ivy League universities combined . 
 = = = Traditions = = = 
 Dartmouth is well known for its fierce school spirit and many traditions . The college functions on a quarter system , and one weekend each term is set aside as a traditional celebratory event , known on campus as " big weekends " or " party weekends " . In the fall term , Homecoming ( officially called Dartmouth Night ) is marked by a bonfire on the Green constructed by the freshman class . Winter term is celebrated by Winter Carnival , a tradition started in 1911 by the Dartmouth Outing Club to promote winter sports . This tradition is the oldest in the United States , and subsequently went on to catch on at other New England colleges . In the spring , Green Key is a weekend mostly devoted to campus parties and celebration . Dartmouth has a historical connection and affiliation with Bates College of Lewiston , Maine , that includes similar traditions such as the Dartmouth Challenge , dual engineering programs , campus parallels and an athletic rivalry . 
 The summer term was formerly marked by Tubestock , an unofficial tradition in which the students used wooden rafts and inner tubes to float on the Connecticut River . Begun in 1986 , Tubestock was ended in 2006 by town ordinance . The Class of 2008 , during their summer term on campus in 2006 , replaced the defunct Tubestock with <unk> . This new celebration includes a barbecue , live music , and the revival of the 1970s and 1980s tradition of racing homemade chariots around the Green . Unlike Tubestock , <unk> is funded and supported by the College . 
 Another longstanding tradition is four @-@ day , student @-@ run Dartmouth Outing Club trips for incoming freshmen , begun in 1935 . Each trip concludes at the Moosilauke Ravine Lodge . In 2011 , over 96 % of freshmen elected to participate .

 = = = Motto and song = = = 
 Dartmouth 's motto , chosen by Eleazar Wheelock , is Vox <unk> in deserto . The Latin motto is literally translated as " A calling voice in the wilderness " , but is more often rendered as " A voice crying out in the wilderness " . The phrase appears five times in the Bible and is a reference to the college 's location on what was once the frontier of European settlement . Richard Hovey 's " Men of Dartmouth " was elected as the best of Dartmouth 's songs in 1896 , and became the school 's official song in 1926 . The song was retitled to " Alma Mater " in the 1980s when its lyrics were changed to refer to women as well as men . 
 = = = Seal = = = 
 Dartmouth 's 1769 royal charter required the creation of a seal for use on official documents and diplomas . The college 's founder Eleazar Wheelock designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel , a missionary society founded in London in 1701 , in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education . Engraved by a Boston silversmith , the seal was ready by commencement of 1773 . The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25 , 1773 , describing it as : 
 An Oval , circumscribed by a Line containing <unk> : COL : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : IN AMERICA 1770 @.@ within projecting a Pine Grove on the Right , whence proceed Natives towards an <unk> two Storey on the left ; which bears in a Label over the Grove these Words " vox <unk> in deserto " the whole supported by Religion on the Right and Justice on the Left , and bearing in a Triangle irradiate , with the Hebrew Words [ El Shaddai ] , agreeable to the above Impression , be the common Seal under which to pass all Diplomas or Certificates of Degrees , and all other Affairs of Business of and concerning Dartmouth College . 
 On October 28 , 1926 , the trustees affirmed the charter 's reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone . The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer W. A. Dwiggins to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use . Dwiggins ' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from " 1770 " to " 1769 " , to accord with the date of the college charter . The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of " 1769 " to replace the old dies , now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use . The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032 . 
 = = = Shield = = = 
 On October 28 , 1926 , the trustees approved a " Dartmouth College Shield " for general use . Artist and engraver W. Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal . This design does not survive . On June 9 , 1944 , the trustees approved another coat of arms based on the shield part of the seal , this one by Canadian artist and designer Thoreau MacDonald . That design was used widely and , like Dwiggins ' seal , had its date changed from " 1770 " to " 1769 " around 1958 . That version continues to be used under trademark registration number <unk> and others . 
 College designer John <unk> made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s , but it did not see the success of MacDonald 's design . The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of Dartmouth Medical School , and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 micrometers across . The design has appeared on Rudolph Ruzicka 's Bicentennial Medal ( Philadelphia Mint , 1969 ) and elsewhere . 
 = = = Nickname , symbol , and mascot = = = 
 Dartmouth has never had an official mascot . The nickname " The Big Green , " originating in the 1860s , is based on students ' adoption of a shade of forest green ( " Dartmouth Green " ) as the school 's official color in 1866 . Beginning in the 1920s , the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname " the Indians " , a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists . This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early 1970s , when its use came under criticism . In 1974 , the Trustees declared the " use of the [ Indian ] symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education . " Some alumni and students , as well as the conservative student newspaper , The Dartmouth Review , have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence , but never succeeded in doing so . 
 Various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a mascot , but none has become " official . " One proposal devised by the college humor magazine the Dartmouth Jack @-@ O @-@ Lantern was Keggy the Keg , an anthropomorphic beer keg who makes occasional appearances at college sporting events . Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy , the mascot has received approval from only the student government . In November 2006 , student government attempted to revive the " <unk> " as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former unofficial Indian mascot .

 Dartmouth 's alumni are known for their devotion to the college . Most start by giving to the Senior Class Gift . According to a 2008 article in The Wall Street Journal , Dartmouth graduates also earn higher median salaries at least 10 years after graduation than alumni of any other American university surveyed . 
 By 2008 , Dartmouth had graduated 238 classes of students and has over 60 @,@ 000 living alumni in a variety of fields . 
 Nelson A. Rockefeller , 41st Vice President of the United States and 49th Governor of New York , graduated cum laude from Dartmouth with a degree in economics in 1930 . Over 164 Dartmouth graduates have served in the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives , such as Massachusetts statesman Daniel Webster . Cabinet members of American presidents include Attorney General Amos T. Akerman , Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal , Secretary of Labor Robert Reich , former Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson , and former Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner . C. Everett Koop was the Surgeon General of the United States under President Ronald Reagan . Two Dartmouth alumni have served as justices on the Supreme Court of the United States : Salmon P. Chase and Levi Woodbury . Eugene Norman Veasey ( class of 1954 ) served as the Chief Justice of Delaware . The 46th and current Governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolf is also a Dartmouth alumnus . 
 In literature and journalism , Dartmouth has produced thirteen Pulitzer Prize winners : Thomas M. Burton , Richard Eberhart , Dan Fagin , Paul Gigot , Frank Gilroy , Jake Hooker , Nigel Jaquiss , Joseph <unk> , Martin J. Sherwin , David K. <unk> , David <unk> , and Justin Harvey Smith .

 = Italian cruiser Urania = 
 Urania was a torpedo cruiser of the Partenope class built for the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) in the 1880s . She was built by the Cantieri navali Odero shipyard ; her keel was laid in February 1889 , she was launched in June 1891 , and was commissioned in July 1893 . Her main armament were her six torpedo tubes , which were supported by a battery of ten small @-@ caliber guns . Urania spent most of her career in the main Italian fleet , where she was primarily occupied with training exercises . She was still in service at the outbreak of the Italo @-@ Turkish War in September 1911 , but she did not take part in any operations . Instead , she remained in Italian waters and was broken up for scrap in January 1912 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Urania was 73 @.@ 1 meters ( 239 ft 10 in ) long overall and had a beam of 8 @.@ 22 m ( 27 ft 0 in ) and an average draft of 3 @.@ 48 m ( 11 ft 5 in ) . She displaced 931 metric tons ( 916 long tons ; 1 @,@ 026 short tons ) normally . Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of horizontal triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving a single screw propeller , with steam supplied by four coal @-@ fired locomotive boilers . Specific figures for Urania 's engine performance have not survived , but the ships of her class had top speeds of 18 @.@ 1 to 20 @.@ 8 knots ( 33 @.@ 5 to 38 @.@ 5 km / h ; 20 @.@ 8 to 23 @.@ 9 mph ) at 3 @,@ 884 to 4 @,@ 422 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 896 to 3 @,@ 297 kW ) . The ship had a cruising radius of about 1 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 300 km ; 2 @,@ 100 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a crew of between 96 – 121 . 
 Urania was armed with a main battery of one 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) / 40 gun and six 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) / 43 guns mounted singly.α She was also equipped with three 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) / 20 guns in single mounts . Her primary offensive weapon was her six 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . The ship was protected by an armored deck that was up to 1 @.@ 6 in ( 41 mm ) thick ; her conning tower was armored with the same thickness of steel plate . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Urania was laid down on 16 February 1889 at the Cantieri navali Odero ( Odero Shipyard ) in Genoa , and was launched on 18 June 1891 . After fitting @-@ out work was completed , the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 21 July 1893 . During the 1893 fleet maneuvers , Urania served with the 2nd Division of the Reserve Squadron , along with the ironclad Castelfidardo , the protected cruiser Stromboli , and four torpedo boats . During the maneuvers , which lasted from 6 August to 5 September , the ships of the Reserve Squadron defended against a simulated attack by the Active Squadron , which gamed a French attack on the Italian fleet . In 1895 , Urania was stationed in the 2nd Maritime Department , split between Taranto and Naples , along with most of the torpedo cruisers in the Italian fleet . These included her sister ships Partenope , Aretusa , Euridice , Iride , Minerva , and Caprera , the four Goito @-@ class cruisers , and Tripoli . 
 The ship was assigned to the 2nd Division of the main fleet in 1897 , along with the three Ruggiero di Lauria @-@ class ironclads and the protected cruisers Etna and Stromboli . In 1899 , Urania was assigned to the 2nd Division of the main fleet , which consisted of the ironclads Affondatore , Castelfidardo , and Sicilia and her sister ship Partenope . The 2nd Division was usually kept in reserve , which amounted to three months of active service per year , with the rest of the time spent in harbor with reduced crews . At the start of the Italo @-@ Turkish War in September 1911 , Urania was stationed in Italy , alternating between the ports of La Spezia and Naples , along with her sister ships Iride and Caprera . She did not see action during the war . In January 1912 , with the war still on @-@ going , the ship was sold for scrap and thereafter broken up . 
 = Space Cavern = 
 Space Cavern is a 1982 shooter video game for the Atari 2600 developed and released by Games by Apollo . Players control a spaceship commander who has landed on a planet and must defend the ship against its hostile creatures . Games by Apollo founder Pat Roper was impressed by the game Demon Attack and tasked Apollo member Dan Oliver with making a game very similar to it . The game was later rereleased as Space Canyon . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In Space Cavern , players control the commander of an intergalactic spaceship that is traveling through a previously unknown area in space . The spaceship lands on a mysterious planet inhabited by creatures known as <unk> and <unk> , who attempt to attack the crew of the ship . 
 The player character is situated at the bottom of the screen . <unk> and rightward movements of the joystick correspond to leftward and rightward movements of the character . Moving the joystick upward and downward induces the character to fire left and right respectively . Pressing the controller button results in the character firing upward . The player must shoot enemy creatures that come from the top and bottom before they shoot the player character . Enemy creatures fire beams that cause the player to lose a life whenever contact is made with the character . An extra life is awarded every 2 @,@ 000 points ; points are earned by destroying enemies , with 115 or 165 points awarded for killing an <unk> and 200 points for a <unk> . 
 There are twenty @-@ four gameplay variations included in Space Cavern ; all are playable by one or two players and activated by modifying the 2600 's difficulty switches . The variations differ in the number of enemies , their speed , the direction of their lasers , and the inclusion of <unk> . 
 = = Development = = 
 Space Cavern was developed by Games by Apollo . Company founder Pat Roper had flown programmer Ed Salvo to a Consumer Electronics Show to show him the Imagic video game Demon Attack . Impressed with Imagic 's game , Roper decided he wanted to produce one similar to it . He told developer Dan Oliver what he wanted in the game without disclosing his inspiration . Space Cavern was released in 1982 . Game publisher Panda rereleased an identical version of Space Cavern under the name Space Canyon the following year , and an Atari 5200 port was started but not completed . 
 As development neared completion , mounting financial pressures came to a head and Games by Apollo found itself owing nearly $ 5 million , half of which debt belonged to its advertising agency Benton & Bowles . Games by Apollo faced growing pressure from Benton & Bowles to repay its debts , and a few months after Space Cavern 's release , on November 12 , 1982 , Games by Apollo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy . Although Roper expected Apollo to " return in smaller form " , the company closed in 1983 after reorganization attempts failed . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The reviewer for Arcade Express magazine was positive about Space Cavern . The review praised the graphics of the player 's death , while criticizing the design of the enemies , and finished the review by opining the game would be more suited for skilled players . TV Gamer 's review criticized it for being too simple and not requiring much brainpower . 
 Videogaming Illustrated compared the game positively to Phoenix , and believed that it was " arguably the best space game on the market " . The writer opined that it was Games by Apollo 's best game , and noted its suitability for both young and experienced players . In a review for Video magazine , Bill Kunkel and Arnie Katz did not agree whether Space Cavern 's control scheme was unnaturally " cumbersome " or " an exciting departure from the expected " . They wrote that the controls were " at least a little controversial " among arcade players . These comments were again reiterated in Video 's 1982 Guide to Electronic Games where the control scheme was described as " a little unusual " . In a follow @-@ up review for Electronic Games , Kunkel and Katz concluded that the game would entertain arcade players hundreds of times over but criticized the graphics of the enemies . Space Cavern was an honorable mention in the " Best Action Video Game " category at the 1983 <unk> Awards . 
 Brett Alan Weiss , writing for Allgame , gave the game two out of five stars . Weiss wrote the game was not " a particularly engaging gaming experience " and referred to it as " an interesting failure . The designers had a couple of good ideas , but the execution of those ideas in conjunction with the shoot- ' em @-@ up action is second rate " . In his book Classic Home Video Games , 1972 – 1984 , Weiss wrote that the game 's box art was better than the actual game . 
 = Simon of Southwell = 
 Simon of Southwell ( sometimes Simon of Sywell , or Simon of <unk> ) was a medieval English canon lawyer and canon who became treasurer of the cathedral chapter of Lichfield Cathedral . He served in the household of Hubert Walter , who was Archbishop of Canterbury from 1193 to 1205 . Pope Celestine III appointed Simon as a papal judge @-@ delegate , and Simon also served Walter in Rome on two legal cases . A number of the glosses on a late @-@ twelfth @-@ century copy of Gratian 's Decretum are ascribed to Simon . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Simon was treasurer of the cathedral chapter in 1203 . He also held a prebend at Lichfield until 1209 . Previously he had been a lecturer in canon law at Bologna , Paris and at Oxford . In Paris , Simon argued a case before Peter the Chanter that dealt with papal mandates , and his arguments won over Peter to his side of the discussion . 
 While at Oxford , Simon , along with John of Tynemouth , Honorius of Kent , and possibly Nicholas de Aquila are the first securely attested lecturers on law known for Oxford . Simon may also have studied canon law at Bologna . 
 = = Service to Hubert Walter = = 
 Simon served in the household of Hubert Walter , who was Archbishop of Canterbury from 1193 to 1205 . Simon served along with other canon lawyers including John of Tynemouth and Honorius of Kent . He had previously been with the household of Hugh , Bishop of Lincoln , transferring to Walter 's household about 1195 . 
 Pope Celestine III appointed Simon as a papal judge @-@ delegate , and Simon also served Walter in Rome on two legal cases . In 1202 , while Walter was on the continent , Simon was named as administrator of the diocese of Canterbury during the archbishop 's absence . 
 In 1203 , Thomas of Marlborough , who was a monk of Evesham Abbey , pleaded a case for Evesham before Archbishop Walter , and later , in his chronicle , he noted that Simon , John of Tynemouth , and Honorius , all canon lawyers from the archbishop 's household , sided with the abbey . He also described the three men as magistri mei in <unk> . Surviving evidence shows that Simon and John frequently found themselves on opposing sides of cases , which suggests a rivalry between the two over their expositions of canon law . Thomas appears to have studied under Simon , John and Honorius at Oxford . 
 One of the cases that Simon pleaded for the archbishop was Walter 's case against Gerald of Wales , who had been elected to the Bishopric of St David 's in Wales . Walter opposed Gerald 's appointment , and Simon , along with John of Tynemouth and another canon lawyer , were sent to Rome to argue Walter 's case against Gerald .

 Like John of Tynemouth , a number of the glosses on a late @-@ twelfth @-@ century copy of Gratian 's Decretum are ascribed to Simon .

Another set of student notes from his lectures , this time entitled Quaestiones , survives as part of British Library MS Royal <unk> This work includes lecture notes not only from Simon 's classes , but from John and Nicholas ' as well . 
 = Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum theft = 
 In the early hours of March 18 , 1990 , security guards at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston , Massachusetts let in two men disguised as police officers who claimed they were responding to a disturbance call . Once inside , the pair revealed their true intentions , tied up the guards , and spent over an hour stealing art from the museum 's collection , which they loaded into their vehicle . It was found that they had taken 13 works of art , valued at $ 500 million , making it the largest private property theft in history . Despite efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) and multiple probes across the world , no arrests have been made and no artwork has yet been recovered . The case remains open and unsolved , with the museum offering a reward of $ 5 million for information leading to recovery of the art . 
 The stolen works were originally purchased by art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner ( 1840 – 1924 ) and intended to be left on permanent display at the museum with the rest of her collection . Since the collection and its layout are permanent , empty frames remain hanging both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for when they are returned . Experts are puzzled by the choice of paintings that were stolen , especially since more valuable artwork was untouched . Among the stolen works was The Concert , one of only 34 known works by Vermeer and thought to be the most valuable unrecovered painting at over $ 200 million . Also missing is The Storm on the Sea of Galilee , Rembrandt 's only known seascape . Other works by Rembrandt , Degas , Manet , and Flinck were also stolen . 
 According to the FBI , the stolen artwork was moved through the region and offered for sale in Philadelphia during the early 2000s . They believe the thieves were members of a criminal organization based in the mid @-@ Atlantic and New England . They also claim to have identified two suspects , although they have not been publicly identified and are now deceased . Boston gangster Bobby Donati has been cited as a possible collaborator in the heist . He was murdered in 1991 as a result of ongoing gang wars . Significant evidence suggests that Hartford , Connecticut gangster Robert Gentile knows the location of the works , although he denies involvement . 
 = = Robbery = = 
 Around midnight on Sunday morning , March 18 , 1990 , a red Dodge Daytona pulled up near the side entrance of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road . Two men with fake police uniforms waited for at least an hour in the car , possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick 's Day party nearby . Later at around 1 : 00 a.m. , security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard . The two guards were the only people in the building . At this time , Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door , claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked . He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously . The FBI has seized the logs , but has not commented on the issue further . 
 At 1 : 24 a.m. , one of the two men outside pushed the buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen that heard of a disturbance in the courtyard , and requested to be let inside . Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside , but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers . He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms . With his partner on patrol , Abath decided to buzz in the men . When the intruders arrived at the main security desk , one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest . Abath stepped out from behind his desk , where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed . He was quickly asked for his ID , ordered to face the wall , and then handcuffed . Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding , until he realized he hadn 't been frisked before being cuffed , and one officer 's mustache was made of wax . The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed , after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested . The thieves explained that they were not being arrested , but rather this was a robbery , and proceeded to take the guards to the museum 's basement . They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands , feet , and heads . 
 Since the museum was equipped with motion detectors , the thieves ' movements throughout the museum were recorded . After tying up the guards , the thieves went upstairs to the Dutch Room . As one of them approached Rembrandt 's Self @-@ Portrait ( 1629 ) , a local alarm sounded , which they immediately smashed . They pulled the painting off the wall and attempted to take the wooden panel out of its heavy frame . Unsuccessful at the attempt , they left the painting on the floor . They cut Rembrandt 's The Storm on the Sea of Galilee out of the frame , as well as A Lady and Gentleman in Black . They also removed Vermeer 's The Concert and <unk> Flinck 's Landscape with an Obelisk from their frames . Additionally , they also took a Chinese bronze gu from the Shang Dynasty . 
 Elsewhere in the museum , they stole five Degas drawings and an eagle finial . The finial lay at the top of a Napoleonic flag , which they attempted to unscrew from the wall , but failed . Manet 's Chez <unk> was also stolen from its location in the Blue Room . Motion detector records show that the only footsteps detected in the Blue Room that night were at 12 : 27 a.m. and again at 12 : 53 a.m. These times match to when Abath said he passed through on patrol . The frame for the painting was found on security chief Lyle W. Grindle 's chair near the front desk . The thieves made two trips to their car with artwork during the theft , which lasted 81 minutes . Before leaving , they visited the guards once more , telling them " You ’ ll be hearing from us in about a year , " although they were never heard from again . The guards remained handcuffed until police arrived at 8 : 15 a.m. later that morning . 
 = = Stolen artwork = = 
 Altogether , thirteen pieces were stolen at an estimated loss of $ 500 million , making the robbery the largest private property theft in history . Empty frames remain hanging in the museum , both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for when they are returned . One of the paintings , The Concert , was Gardner 's first major acquisition and one of only 34 known Vermeer works in the world . It is thought to be the most valuable unrecovered stolen painting , with a value estimated at over $ 200 million . Another painting , The Storm on the Sea of Galilee , is Rembrandt 's only known seascape . The bronze finial was taken from the top of a Napoleonic flag , possibly appearing like gold to the thieves . The museum is offering a $ 100 @,@ 000 reward for this piece alone . 
 The museum stresses that the paintings be kept in good condition by whoever has them . Museum director , Anne Hawley has stated that the works should be kept in a stable environment of 50 % humidity and 70 ° F. Additionally , they should be kept away from light and stored in acid @-@ free paper . Hawley also noted to avoid rolling the paintings , which will crack the paint . If these guidelines are not followed , the paintings could be damaged and drop in value . More repainting would need to be done too , which hurts the paintings ' integrity . 
 The following are the thirteen stolen works , all of which are still missing . 
 Notes 
 = = Investigation = = 
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation took control of the case on the grounds that the artwork could likely cross state lines . They have conducted hundreds of interviews with probes stretching across the world involving Scotland Yard , Japanese and French authorities , private investigators , museum directors , and art dealers . The FBI believes the thieves were members of a criminal organization based in the mid @-@ Atlantic and New England , and that the stolen paintings were moved through Connecticut and the Philadelphia area in the years following the theft . Some of the art may have been offered for sale in Philadelphia in the early 2000s , including The Storm on the Sea of Galilee ; however , their knowledge of what happened to the works after the attempted sale is limited . The FBI stated it believed to know the identity of the thieves in 2013 , but in 2015 announced that they were now deceased . They have declined to identify the individuals . 
 No single motive or pattern has emerged through the thousands of pages of evidence gathered . The selection of works puzzles the experts , specifically since more valuable artworks were available . The FBI 's lead agent assigned to the case , Geoffrey J. Kelly , finds it difficult to understand why this assortment of items was stolen despite the thieves being in the museum for enough time to take whatever they wished . On their way to the finial , the thieves passed by two <unk> and a Botticelli painting . Titian 's The Rape of Europa , which is one of the museum 's most well @-@ known and valuable pieces , was not stolen . Due to the brutish ways the criminals handled the robbery , cutting the painting from their frames and smashing frames for two Degas sketches , investigators believe the thieves were amateur criminals , not experts commissioned to steal particular works . Some investigators believe the works were destroyed , explaining why they have not reappeared . Theories on the theft include that it was organized the Irish Republican Army in order to raise money or bargain for the release of imprisoned comrades . Another theory states Whitey Bulger as the ringleader of the theft . At the time of the heist , he was Boston 's top crime boss and an FBI informant . 
 The museum first offered a reward of $ 1 million , but that was later increased to $ 5 million in 1997 . The reward is for " information that leads directly to the recovery of all of [ their ] items in good condition " , which remains on offer more than a quarter @-@ century later . Federal authorities have stated they will not charge anyone who voluntarily turns in the artwork , but anyone caught knowingly in possession of stolen items could be prosecuted . The thieves cannot face charges because the five @-@ year statute of limitations have expired . 
 = = = Leads = = = 
 In 1994 , the museum director Anne Hawley received a letter that promised the return of the pieces for $ 2 @.@ 6 million . If interested , the museum had to get the The Boston Globe to publish a coded message in a business story . The message was published , but the writer disappeared after law enforcement got involved . 
 Late one night in 1997 , Boston Herald reporter Tom <unk> was driven to a warehouse in Red Hook , Brooklyn by William Youngworth to see what was purported to be The Storm on the Sea of Galilee . Youngworth was a career criminal and associate to New England art thief Myles Connor Jr . <unk> had been investigating the theft and was briefly allowed to view the painting with a flashlight . He was given a vial of paint chips for authenticity . These were later confirmed by experts to be fragments of Dutch 17th century origin — but not from the stolen painting . It was never concretely determined to be real or fake , and the FBI quit speaking to Youngworth after not making any progress . The painting has since disappeared . 
 On August 6 , 2015 , police released a video from the night before the theft , that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery . Two men appear on the tape ; one of them remains unidentified , while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath , a security guard on duty the night of the heist . The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice within a few minutes . The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby , then returned to a car and drove off . Police say the video opens new lines of investigation , and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator . However , the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist . 
 In December 2015 , over 20 FBI agents conducted a search of the Suffolk Downs horse racing track in East Boston , acting on a tip that the stolen works were stashed there . Agents searched the horse stables , parts of the grandstand that have been closed since the early 1990s , and drilled open two stand @-@ up safes . There were rumors among Suffolk Downs employees in the 1990s that the racetrack was a temporary hiding location for the paintings . The search at the racetrack did not reveal any of the stolen works . 
 = = = Potential collaborators = = = 
 Boston gangster Bobby Donati may have been involved in the heist . New England art thief Myles J. Connor Jr . , in prison at the time of the robbery , has stated that he and associate Bobby Donati eyed the museum in the 1980s and Donati oversaw the operation . Shortly before the robbery , Donati was seen at a night club with a sack of police uniforms . Donati worked under Boston crime boss Vincent Ferrara , and visited him in prison in the early 1990s . When Ferrara asked about the robbery , Donati said he " buried the stuff " and will find a way to negotiate his release . Donati was murdered in 1991 as a result of ongoing gang wars . 
 Hartford , Connecticut gangster Robert " Bobby the Cook " Gentile has been suggested on multiple occasions as knowing the location of the Gardner works . In May 2012 , FBI agents searched Gentile 's home in Manchester , Connecticut . They did not find any stolen works , despite searching his preferred hiding spot beneath a false floor with the help of his son . However , in the basement , they found a sheet of paper listing what each stolen piece might draw on the black market . In January 2016 , the FBI contrived gun charges against Gentile to force him to reveal the location of the missing works . During a hearing , a federal prosecutor revealed significant evidence tying Gentile to the crime . The prosecutor stated that Gentile and mob partner Robert Guarente attempted to use the return of two stolen pieces to reduce a prison sentence for one of their associates . Guarente 's wife told investigators in early 2015 that her husband once had possession of some of the art , and gave two paintings to Gentile before Guarente died of cancer in 2004 . Also , while in federal prison during 2013 – 2014 , Gentile told at least three people he had knowledge of the stolen art . In 2015 , Gentile submitted to a lie detector test , denying advanced knowledge of the heist or ever possessing any paintings . The result showed a 0 @.@ 1 % chance that he was truthful . According to Gentile 's lawyer , federal agents are convinced that Gentile has the stolen works . Gentile 's home was searched again by the FBI on May 2 , 2016 , even though his lawyer insists that if Gentile had the stolen artwork or knowledge of its whereabouts , he would have turned it in for the reward money a long time ago . 
 When the museum raised its bounty in 1997 , Myles J Connor Jr. said he could locate the missing artwork in exchange for legal immunity . Authorities rejected his offer . Connor now believes that the Gardner works have passed into other , unknown hands . “ I was probably told , but I don ’ t remember , ” he said , blaming a heart attack that affected his memory . Louis Royce , another Boston area gangster , claims he is still owed 15 % for devising the plan for two fake policemen to request access to the museum at night .

 Due to the high profile of the museum theft , it has been referenced and parodied in many different works . The theft was the subject of the 2005 documentary Stolen , which first appeared in a slightly different version on Court TV . The more well @-@ known paintings have been referenced in multiple TV shows , including The Blacklist episode " The Courier " , The Simpsons episode " American History X @-@ <unk> " , Drunk History episode " Boston " , and American Greed . Two books were written by former investigators including Artful Deception ( 2012 ) by James J McGovern and Stolen Masterpiece Tracker ( 2006 ) by Thomas McShane . Stephen Kurkjian , a recurrent Boston Globe reporter on the case has written a book about his experience titled Master Thieves : The Boston Gangsters Who Pulled Off the World ’ s Greatest Art Heist . The theft is central to the plot of the 2013 novel , Irreplaceable , by Charles Pinning .

It was later released on the Wii 's Virtual Console in North America on May 21 , 2007 ( 2007 @-@ 05 @-@ 21 ) , in Europe on May 25 , 2007 ( 2007 @-@ 05 @-@ 25 ) , in Australia on July 30 , 2007 ( 2007 @-@ 07 @-@ 30 ) , and in Japan on June 17 , 2008 ( 2008 @-@ 06 @-@ 17 ) . It was released for the PlayStation Network on July 21 , 2010 ( 2010 @-@ 07 @-@ 21 ) and on the Wii U 's Virtual Console on June 11 , 2014 ( 2014 @-@ 06 @-@ 11 ) both in Japan . It is based on the Japanese film Gunhed ( only referenced in the Japanese version ) . In the game , a fictional galaxy is under attack by an enemy space armada called the Dark Squadron , and this galaxy 's only chance for survival is the Gunhed Advanced Star Fighter , who must destroy the Dark Squadron and its Super Weapons . The gameplay features fast vertical scrolling and a wide array of weapons for the player to use . 
 Blazing Lazers was developed by the same personnel who developed other video game series such as Puyo Puyo and Super Bomberman as well as other games such as Zanac , The Guardian Legend , and <unk> Fantasy : Milon 's <unk> Adventure . It was one of the first games released for the TurboGrafx @-@ 16 and has received critical praise for its graphical capabilities , lack of slowdown , intense gameplay , and sound . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The player takes control of the Gunhed Star Fighter through nine vertically scrolling areas . The player 's mission is to destroy the Dark Squadron and its eight enemy Super Weapons . Every area contains one or more bosses , all of which must be destroyed before continuing in the game . Players lose a life if they are hit by an enemy or projectile , with the game continuing at a previously – crossed checkpoint , unless they grab a flashing orb which destroys all on @-@ screen enemies and allows them to continue at the point where their previous ship was destroyed ( represented by the icon illustrating the remaining number of ships turning gold ) . The game ends when all lives have been lost , but the game awards 1 @-@ ups when the player scores a particular number of points . The game provides four continues in which players can restart the game at that level in which their previous game ended provided the system is not turned off . 
 The player controls a rapid @-@ fire main cannon , which can either be upgraded or changed to other types of weapons by collecting various numbered power @-@ ups and purple orbs called " gel capsules . " Players can collect optional power @-@ ups to help fight through the game such as " <unk> " that shadow their actions , homing missiles , shields , and enhanced firing capabilities known as " full fire " . The player carries a limited supply of " cluster bombs " that can be deployed , destroying large quantities of enemies and bosses within the player 's vicinity . Players have the function of selecting the speed of their ship , which can be toggled by pressing a button on the gamepad , among five different speeds ( the button cycles between them in order ) . The number of triangles that appear below the player 's score designate the speed of the player 's ship . This allows players to customize the behavior of their ship at any time , trading off freedom of movement against ease of control : a faster ship is more agile , a slower ship can be maneuvered precisely .

 Blazing Lazers was co @-@ developed by Hudson Soft and Compile . The game was directed by Masamitsu " Moo " <unk> , president of Compile and creator of Zanac , The Guardian Legend and the Puyo Puyo series ; Mikio <unk> , director of the Super Bomberman series for the Super NES , and <unk> Kawada , designer of the Super Famicom game <unk> Fantasy . The game was released as Gunhed on July 7 , 1989 ( 1989 @-@ 07 @-@ 07 ) for the Japanese PC Engine console as a tie @-@ in to the live action film of the same name . It was subsequently released in North America as Blazing Lazers in November 1989 , with the game localized for the North American audience by removing the references to the Gunhed film . The game was rereleased on the Wii 's Virtual Console service in North America on May 21 , 2007 ( 2007 @-@ 05 @-@ 21 ) , in Europe on May 25 , 2007 ( 2007 @-@ 05 @-@ 25 ) , in Australia on July 30 , 2007 ( 2007 @-@ 07 @-@ 30 ) , and in Japan on June 17 , 2008 ( 2008 @-@ 06 @-@ 17 ) . It was released for the PlayStation Network in Japan on July 21 , 2010 ( 2010 @-@ 07 @-@ 21 ) . During development of the game Super Star Soldier , NEC considered calling the game Blazing Lazers II because of the similarity in gameplay with Blazing Lazers . The game was featured in a preview of future TurboGrafx @-@ 16 games in Electronic Gaming Monthly in November 1989 . In a section previewing new TurboGrafx @-@ 16 games , said that game was a " total blast from start to finish " .

 The game has been considered by game reviewers as one of the better shoot ' em up video games in the genre as well as one of the best games on the TurboGrafx @-@ 16 gaming console . Hartley , Patricia , and Kirk Lesser from Dragon reviewed the game in its " The Role of Computers " column , giving the game 5 out of 5 stars . Brett Alan Weiss from Allgame considered this game as " one of the most highly regarded games in the TurboGrafx @-@ 16 library " . VideoGames & Computer Entertainment featured a walkthrough of the game which spanned over two issues in 1990 ; they praised the game , saying that it is " one of the fastest games for the TurboGrafx @-@ 16 " , that it " will keep you going for hours " . 
 Steve Harris reviewed the game in Electronic Gaming Monthly in November 1989 . He said that Blazing Lazers was the next best game to the much @-@ anticipated port of R @-@ Type . He noted the great gameplay and spectacular graphics , sound , and music . He appreciated the amount of detail in the game 's graphics . He said that the large bosses in the game were the best part , saying that they " were enough to make even die @-@ hard veterans of video game wars cringe in terror " . His only criticism of the game was its difficulty , especially in the game 's final level ; he says that the final level is near @-@ impossible if players have lost all their power @-@ ups . The game would be featured in a series of cheats in the magazine 's January 1990 issue . It was reviewed again in the magazine 's December 1989 issue by Harris and three other reviewers . In the review , Harris added that the game takes advantage of the TurboGrafx @-@ 16 's processors with its animation and gameplay . Ed Semrad appreciated the detailed backgrounds , difficulty , and action , but he criticized the game for being repetitive . Donn Nauert called Blazing Lazers the best game on the console , while Martin Alessi called it the best shoot ' em up on any console ; Alessi added that the gameplay , graphics , and sound are " near perfect " . 
 Blazing Lazers received further praise after it was released on the Virtual Console . Mike Fahey from Kotaku describes the game as the " best damn shooter on the TurboGrafx , if not best game overall " . Lucas Thomas from IGN referred to the game as superior to other shoot ' em up games such as Super Star Soldier , Gradius III , and the R @-@ Type series . Thomas further asserts that the game had " pushed the [ TurboGrafx @-@ 16 ] to its limits " . Frank Provo from GameSpot also gave positive reviews for Blazing Lazers , saying that the game , despite the plain graphics and aesthetics , compensates with intense gameplay and a " ridiculous orgy of firepower " . He also lauds the game for its diverse weaponry , lack of graphical slowdown seen in some older console games , and the superior , futuristic audio , which he says has an " optimistic quality " to it . 
 Jeremy Parish from the site 1UP.com praised Blazing Lazers , saying that the game is " drowned in goodness " . Justin Leeper from GameSpy especially praised the game also for its lack of slowdown , stating that prior to 1989 players could only experience the same in arcades . He claimed that the game surpassed any game on the Nintendo Entertainment System at that time . He lauds the smooth scrolling , lush background graphics , and " catchy tunes . " Paul Glancey from the UK @-@ based magazine Computer and Video Games gave it a score 96 % , praising the gameplay , difficulty , graphics and sound , calling it " utterly incredible " and stating " Anyone on the quest for the ultimate shoot ' em up — this is it ! THIS IS IT ! ! " . 
 = Darkness Falls ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Darkness Falls " is the twentieth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on April 15 , 1994 . " Darkness Falls " was written by series creator Chris Carter , and directed by Joe Napolitano . It featured guest appearances by Jason Beghe and Titus Welliver . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , a stand @-@ alone plot that is unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Darkness Falls " earned a Nielsen household rating of 8 @.@ 0 , being watched by 7 @.@ 5 million households in its initial broadcast , and received positive reviews , earning an Environmental Media Award for its treatment of illegal logging . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In this episode , Mulder and Scully are called in to investigate when a team of loggers disappear without a trace . Initially suspecting eco @-@ terrorism , the agents find themselves trapped by a seemingly ancient menace lurking in the woods . 
 Chris Carter was inspired to write this episode based on an interest in dendrochronology , a subject that involves analyzing annual growth rings found in non @-@ tropical tree species . Carter credits the episode 's ominous ending with his experience growing up in the era following the Watergate scandal , having spent his life coming to mistrust the government profoundly . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Olympic National Forest in Washington state , a group of loggers flee through the woods , trying to escape from an unseen force . They are eventually killed by a large swarm of small glowing green insects . 
 Later , at FBI headquarters , Fox Mulder shows Dana Scully a photo of the missing loggers , telling her that another group of loggers disappeared in the forest in 1934 . The two agents head to the forest , where they meet Park Ranger Larry Moore and Steve Humphreys , head of security for the logging company . While driving through the forest , their truck hits caltrops left in the ground by eco @-@ terrorists , forcing them to walk the rest of the way . Upon arriving at the camp site , Mulder and Scully find the cabins abandoned and the communication equipment destroyed . Searching the forest , they find a corpse encased in a large cocoon hanging from a tree . 
 While repairing one of the heat generators , Humphreys catches an eco @-@ terrorist named Doug Spinney . He tells the group that there 's a deadly swarm of insects in the forest and that they must avoid darkness to stay alive . The next morning , they find an old @-@ growth tree cut down with an unexplained band of green contained within its growth rings . Spinney suspects that an organism that was dormant in the tree for centuries was disturbed when the tree was illegally cut down . Humphreys hikes down to Moore 's truck , but is killed by the swarm at nightfall . In the cabin , everyone else is kept safe by the light . The next morning , Spinney convinces Mulder to let him hike to his colleagues with gasoline so he can return with a Jeep to pick them up . Scully and Moore confront Mulder , since this will leave them with little fuel for the generator . 
 The night passes with only a single light bulb lighting the cabin , going out just as morning arrives . Mulder , Scully and Moore hike down to the truck with a busted tire from camp , hoping to patch it , put on the spare and escape . They find Humphreys dead . Spinney returns with the Jeep , telling the others his friends are all dead . The Jeep hits another spike left in the ground , and Spinney is killed when he leaves the Jeep after dark . Moore and the agents are engulfed by the insects , which enter the vehicle through the air conditioning . They are found soon after and brought to a quarantined facility in Winthrop , Washington , where one of the scientists tells Mulder that the forest is being bombarded with pesticides and controlled fire in the hopes of eradicating the insects . 
 = = Production = = 
 Chris Carter was inspired to write this episode based on an interest in dendrochronology , a subject that involves analyzing annual growth rings found in non @-@ tropical tree species , as he believed that trees that were " thousands of years old " might end up acting as " time capsules " that would shed light on past events or species . Carter also credits the episode 's ominous ending with his experience growing up in the era following the Watergate scandal , having spent his life coming to mistrust the government profoundly . The green insects in this episode were primarily computer @-@ generated and added in during the post @-@ production process . The close @-@ up shots of the bugs were done using microscopic photography of mites . 
 The episode was intended to be a bottle episode , meaning that it would be an episode that would be based in a single location and help save money , but bad weather plagued production , and it was one of the toughest episodes of the season for the crew . The episode was shot on location in Lynn Valley , British Columbia , in the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve , known as the Seymour Demonstration Forest . The atmosphere amongst many of the crew had grown quite tense towards the end of the shooting schedule , and it culminated in a heated argument between director Joe Napolitano and first assistant director Vladimir Steffof , after which Napolitano did not appear on location again . " Darkness Falls " was the last episode of the series that Napolitano directed . The weather delayed production at the site so much that pick @-@ up shots and inserts had to be filmed at a later date to finish the episode . Delays were also caused by the inaccessibility of the location , as only generators , camera equipment , and first aid crew were able to stay on @-@ site , and time was wasted commuting staff in each day . Jason Beghe , who played Ranger Larry Moore , was a childhood friend of David Duchovny and helped convince him to pursue an acting career . The camaraderie between the two actors is said to have helped lighten the mood during the episode 's difficult production . 
 = = Broadcast and reception = = 
 " Darkness Falls " premiered on the Fox network on April 15 , 1994 , and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on February 9 , 1995 . This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 8 @.@ 0 with a 14 share , meaning that roughly 8 percent of all television @-@ equipped households and 14 percent of households watching television were tuned in to the episode . It was viewed by 7 @.@ 5 million households . 
 In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly , " Darkness Falls " was rated a B , with the episode being called an " eerie outing " set against a " torn @-@ from @-@ today 's @-@ headlines backdrop " . Zack Handlen , writing for The A.V. Club , called " Darkness Falls " an " excellent " episode that " hits the right notes " . He praised the episode 's setting , comparing it to the earlier first season episode " Ice " ; and felt that the " on @-@ the @-@ nose " approach to the environmental themes worked well . Matt Haigh , writing for Den of Geek , felt positively about the episode 's ambiguous resolution , feeling that its " open @-@ ended treatment " lent the episode " a real mysticism and strength " and finding that the episode held a sense of " weight , credibility , and intrigue " . Writers for IGN named the episode their fifth @-@ favorite standalone episode of the show , finding that it " boasts several interesting twists " and noting positively the episode 's " smart " environmental themes . 
 Although writer and series creator Chris Carter claims " Darkness Falls " was not written with an environmental message in mind , the episode was honored at the fourth annual Environmental Media Awards in 1994 , winning in the " Television Episodic Drama " category . The plot for " Darkness Falls " was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1995 by Les Martin . 
 = Stockport County F.C. = 
 Stockport County Football Club is a semi @-@ professional football club in Stockport , Greater Manchester , England . Formed in 1883 as Heaton Norris Rovers , the team adopted their name in 1890 after the County Borough of Stockport . They have played at Edgeley Park since 1902 , traditionally in blue and white , and are nicknamed The Hatters after the town 's former hat @-@ making industry . 
 Stockport County joined the Football League in 1900 and competed in it continuously from 1905 to 2011 . The team spent most of their history in the lower reaches of the Football League , but the 1990s were more successful with the club competing in the First Division ( now known as the Championship ) for five seasons , whilst they also reached the League Cup semi @-@ finals in 1996 – 97 . However , instability on and off the pitch eventually led to Stockport falling back to the lower divisions . The club started the 2011 – 12 season in the Conference National , having been relegated from Football League Two at the end of 2010 – 11 . They are currently the longest surviving Football League team to drop out of the league , having played in the league for a total of 110 years . At the end of 2012 – 13 , Stockport were relegated to the Conference North .

 Stockport County was formed in 1883 as Heaton Norris Rovers by members of the Wycliffe Congregational Church , and played their first recorded game in October the next year . The club adopted ' The Hatters ' as their nickname , owing to Stockport 's history as the centre of the Victorian hat @-@ making industry , a nickname that is shared with Luton Town . Stockport played in the Lancashire League until 1900 , when they gained admission to the Football League Second Division . Stockport 's first Football League match was against Leicester Fosse which ended in a 2 – 2 draw . Stockport left their Green Lane home in 1902 and moved to Edgeley Park where they currently reside . 
 The club finished in the bottom three for their first four seasons , and at the end of 1903 – 04 they failed to gain re @-@ election . They spent one year in the Lancashire Combination ( a league which they won ) and the Midland League . At the end of the season , they were re @-@ admitted to the Football League after being re @-@ elected through the Midland League . In their first season back in the Football League , Stockport reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time ; however , they were knocked out by Lincoln City . Stockport finished the league in 10th position that season . 
 Stockport remained in Division 2 of the Football League for seven years until 1912 – 13 when they again had to seek re @-@ election . Stockport gained 22 votes and was therefore re @-@ elected . Despite an unsuccessful 1920 – 21 campaign that saw Stockport end the season bottom of the Second Division , which would normally have seen them face re @-@ election however , they were placed in the new Third Division North . After winning five of their first six matches ; along with going unbeaten from New Years Day 1921 to Easter Weekend 1922 ; Stockport set the standard for the division and gained their first Football League title when they beat Darlington in front of 18 @,@ 500 fans at Edgeley Park . Albert Williams ( the then manager ) was presented with the trophy seven days later before the home game with Lincoln City . This title win began a remarkable coincidence which has occurred in each of Stockport 's title winning seasons where Lincoln City have been the last opponents in each of those seasons . Joe O 'Kane ; who joined Stockport the previous season , was a major factor in the clubs promotion although he left the club at the end of the season . 
 Once Stockport returned to Division 2 , they struggled and survived an automatic relegation by one point . The 1923 – 24 season saw Stockport County finish 13th , one place above Manchester United . This is the only time in history Stockport has achieved better than Manchester United . During this campaign Stockport goalkeeper Harry Hardy was called up to play for the England national team and kept a clean sheet in a 4 – 0 win against Belgium . He is the only player to be capped at full level by England while on Stockport 's books . Two seasons later ( 1925 – 26 ) Stockport returned to the bottom division after finishing bottom of the league and only picking up 25 points . Stockport finished 6th the next season ( 1926 – 27 ) but suffered a 2 @-@ point deduction and £ 100 fine for fielding an ineligible player after the registration documents for Joe Smith were not received by the Football League . 
 Stockport closed out the 1920s in Division Three North with a 3rd @-@ placed finish in 1927 – 28 . Joe Smith was Stockport 's and the division 's leading goalscorer in this particular season contributing to 38 of Stockport 's 89 goals . Stockport also finished second on two occasions , one in 1928 – 29 ; Where Stockport amassed 62 points , scored over 100 goals in a season and averaged 10 @,@ 000 fans for the first time , it was a memorable season , but one that in the end had been disappointing after Stockport won nine of their last 11 matches it had still not been enough to win the league . Stockport also finished second the following season ; 1929 – 30 with an even better record than in the previous season , finishing four points behind the champions Port Vale despite beating them 2 – 1 away on Christmas Day and 4 – 2 on Boxing Day , 1929 . Frank Newton was Stockport 's and the division 's leading goalscorer in this particular season contributing to 36 of Stockport 's 106 goals . 
 = = = 1930 – 1950 = = = 
 From the start of the 1930s , Stockport County played in a home strip of white and black and were nicknamed the ' Lilywhites ' . The 1933 – 34 season saw them achieve 115 goals . These included a 13 – 0 home win over Halifax Town on 6 January 1934 ; Joe Hill made his debut for Stockport scoring twice to making the score 2 – 0 at half time . Hill completed his hat trick on 51 minutes also Percy Downes make a notable performance scoring four of Stockport 's goals on this day . This record victory still stands as a Football League record today . Over the course of the 1933 – 34 season Alf Lythgoe scored 46 goals for Stockport . Both of these records still stand in the club 's history . Another first for Stockport was also seen during this season when Stockport 's 2 – 1 home defeat to Crystal Palace in the second round of the FA Cup was shown on television . Stockport finished third in this season . 
 The Main Stand of Edgeley Park , which in 1935 was made of wood , burned down in a fire , destroying all of Stockport County 's records before 1935 . Besides having to rebuild a significant section of the ground , the club had to piece together historical information . The current Main Stand , was built a year later in 1936 and officially opened by Charles Sutcliffe , then President of the Football League . In 1936 – 37 County won the Third Division North , gaining 60 points and 23 wins . Towards the end of this season , Stockport had a ten @-@ game unbeaten run that included seven victories before a last @-@ day title decider against Lincoln City in which more than 27 @,@ 000 fans watched . The following season , Stockport finished 22nd out of 22 in the Second Division and were relegated to Division 3 ( North ) after only earning 31 points . 
 During the 1939 – 40 season football was stopped following Britain 's declaration of war and was not resumed until the end of World War II . This was because most British men were sent to the army . Stockport played only two matches in the 1939 – 40 season before war was declared , losing both and being bottom of the league . Regional league competitions were set up ; appearances in these tournaments do not count in players ' official records . Due to teams having a depleting number of players most teams resigned from football , the clubs that were left to complete used guest players to make up their numbers . The FA Cup was also suspended and replaced with the Football League War Cup . 
 In the first war league after the outbreak of World War II ( 1940 – 41 ) Stockport finished in 35th place overall in the Northern Regional League after playing 29 games . League standings were calculated by goal average over the course of games played , with some teams playing more than others . In 1945 – 46 , English football still did not have a football season ; however , The FA Cup competition was resumed . Stockport was eliminated from the 1945 – 46 FA Cup in the first round after a 3 – 2 aggregate loss to Rochdale . The first post @-@ war league season 1946 – 47 saw Stockport finish fourth in Division 3 ( North ) with 24 wins and 50 points . 
 = = = 1950 – 1999 = = = 
 The 1950s brought little league success , but were notable for goal @-@ scoring by Jack Connor , whose 140 goals in five seasons are still a club record . These included 13 hat @-@ tricks ( three of which were consecutive – once against Crewe Alexandra and twice against Chester ) , two instances of four goals in a match ( against Workington and Carlisle United ) , and two of five goals in a match ( against Bradford Park Avenue and the Tranmere Rovers ) . When the regional Third Divisions were to be combined into national Third and Fourth Divisions after the 1957 – 58 campaign , Stockport finished in the top half of the Third Division North and so were placed in the following season 's national Third Division . 
 Stockport spent one season at this level before the club was demoted . Stockport played in the first League Cup competition in 1960 – 61 , beating Carlisle United in the first round , but the club was eliminated in the second round after a 3 – 0 defeat against Manchester City . Stockport survived re @-@ election in the 1964 – 65 season . After finishing bottom of the league with 27 points , the club was re @-@ elected by gaining 45 votes . During the 1964 – 65 season , then Stockport Chairman Vic Bernard re @-@ introduced the royal blue strip , colours they still play in . Two seasons later Stockport returned to Third Division by winning the Fourth Division in 1966 – 67 after gaining 64 points . 
 After the club was relegated in 1969 – 70 , the 1970s and 1980s consisted of little other than mediocrity and struggling against re @-@ <unk> February 1984 Stockport competed in their first Associate Members ' Cup match against Crewe Alexandra in a competition their chairman at the time ' Dragan Lukic ' helped create . The matched finished 2 – 2 after extra time and as so was decided in a penalty shoot @-@ out ; the first in Stockport 's history . Stockport went on to lose 3 – 0 on penalties . The introduction of automatic promotion and relegation between the Football League and the Conference was not a good sign for Stockport , and in 1986 – 87 they had just six points from 13 games and faced a real prospect of non @-@ League football , exemplified by being eliminated from the FA Cup by Caernarfon Town . Colin Murphy was brought in for his second spell as manager . Stockport gained 45 points from their final 31 games and survived , although Murphy left shortly after the end of the season . 
 Danny Bergara was appointed as manager in March 1989 , quickly transforming the team , and automatic promotion was gained in 1990 – 91 . The next three seasons saw Stockport make the play @-@ offs , but failed to result in another promotion . In March 1995 Bergara was sacked after an altercation with then @-@ chairman Brendan Elwood , and Dave Jones was appointed manager in April of that year . A new all @-@ seater , Cheadle End , holding just over 5 @,@ 000 in capacity , was opened at the start of the 1995 – 96 season . Although this particular season was unremarkable , the club reached the third round of the FA Cup , where they faced holders Everton . Stockport reached a 2 – 2 draw with Everton at Goodison Park , and for the replay ten days later over 11 @,@ 000 gathered at Edgeley Park to witness Everton 's late winner in a 3 – 2 victory . 
 The 1996 – 97 campaign proved to be the most successful in the club 's history . They finished second in the Second Division and reached the semi @-@ final of the League Cup , knocking out three Premiership teams ( Blackburn Rovers , Southampton and West Ham United ) on the way before losing to Middlesbrough 2 – 1 on aggregate . Before the start of the 1997 – 98 season , Dave Jones left for Southampton . Gary Megson left Blackpool to take over as manager and in his first season Stockport finished eighth , just two places off the playoffs to reach the Premiership – the club 's best ever league placing . 
 However , the following 1998 – 99 season saw Stockport finish 16th , winning just 3 of their final 14 matches . A 5 – 0 defeat at relegated Oxford United on the final day signaled the end of Megson 's time at Edgeley Park . The club decided to promote from within and Andy Kilner was soon put in charge . He had an encouraging start to his management at County having defeated Manchester City , 2 – 1 at Maine Road ; And by Boxing Day the club were sixth , holding a playoff spot . 
 = = = 2000 – 2010 = = = 
 After their win over Manchester City , the team then went a club @-@ record 19 games without a victory , eventually finishing the 1999 – 2000 season 17th , with two late wins helping stave off relegation . The 2000 – 01 season saw them again narrowly avoid relegation , finishing 19th overall . The 2001 – 02 season turned out to be the club 's worst ever season at the time . With Stockport already bottom of the league , a 4 – 0 home defeat to Millwall saw manager Kilner sacked . Former England international Carlton Palmer was appointed in November 2001 . Palmer subsequently failed to stop Stockport being relegated in 2001 – 02 or to build a team capable of challenging for a return the next season . 
 The summer of 2003 saw the club change ownership , as Elwood sold the club to Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy in a move that would see Sale play their home games at Edgeley Park . A new company was created , called ' Cheshire Sport ' , which would have ownership of Stockport County , Sale Sharks and the Edgeley Park stadium . The 2003 – 04 season saw Palmer sacked after another poor start to the season , following home defeats to Hartlepool and Blackpool in the space of a week . John Hollins , who had been Director of Football during Palmer 's reign , took over as caretaker manager , but was replaced full @-@ time by former Northern Ireland manager Sammy McIlroy . Following more relegation worries , an 11 @-@ match unbeaten run saw the club again climb to safety at the end of the season . Sammy McIlroy continued as manager in the 2004 – 05 season ; poor results led to his sacking and the appointment of Chris Turner one year later . 
 2005 – 06 saw Stockport County change owners again . After reportedly losing £ 4m , Cheshire Sports chairman Brian Kennedy handed ownership of the club to the Supporters Trust , whose aim was to rescue the club from revenue loss , eventually break even and turn Stockport County into a community based football club . However , another relegation followed , and Turner resigned after one year in charge after a 6 – 0 defeat to local rivals Macclesfield Town that left County five points adrift of safety and facing a third relegation in four years . 
 Former player Jim Gannon was placed in charge , initially as caretaker @-@ manager . He led the club to safety in 2005 – 06 , and County sustained a promotion challenge the next season , eventually missing out on the League Two playoffs on goal difference . The club also set a new Football League record on 3 March 2007 when they beat Swindon Town 3 – 0 , recording nine consecutive wins without conceding a goal . 
 At the start of the 2007 – 08 season it was learned that former manager Danny Bergara had died . Stockport County continued their success , despite losing an FA Cup first round replay away to non @-@ League Staines Town on penalties . The early months of 2008 saw Stockport equal a league record of eight consecutive away victories . Approaching the end of the season , they had an outside chance to qualify for promotion automatically but missed out , finishing the season in fourth place . However , after beating Wycombe Wanderers 2 – 1 on aggregate in the play @-@ off semi @-@ final , Stockport played Rochdale at Wembley in the final , coming from behind to secure a 3 – 2 victory and earn promotion to League One for the next season . 
 During the 2008 – 09 season , Stockport defied the odds by challenging for a play @-@ off place , but their form dipped during the final months of the season , which saw them slip to mid @-@ table . Gannon was approached by Brighton & Hove Albion and the approach was accepted by Stockport , but after talks with the chairman of Brighton , Gannon rejected the job and stayed at Stockport . 
 On 30 April 2009 , Stockport County was placed into administration following a battle to repay creditors . This followed a petition by a creditor to repay a loan of around £ 300 @,@ 000 . The club had also struggled to repay a tax debt of £ 250 @,@ 000 to Her Majesty 's Revenue and Customs . On 16 December 2009 the team 's training ground was put up for sale . 
 On 12 June 2009 , Leonard Curtis , administrator of Stockport County Football Club , announced that they had agreed to terms with the Melrose Consortium for the sale of the club . Paul Reeves , one of the joint administrators , commented that , " Whilst a deal has been agreed , it is subject to the Melrose Consortium obtaining landlord approval . This is a positive step to safeguarding the club 's future . " The Melrose Consortium , consisting of " a group of businessmen with a sporting background " headed by ex Manchester City player Jim Melrose said , " We look forward to developing a fruitful relationship with Sale Sharks and Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council which will provide the basis for a successful future for Stockport County Football Club . " 
 The immediate aims of the Melrose Consortium were described as being to " ... guarantee football at Edgeley Park next season and to secure the services of redundant manager , and Stockport legend , Jim Gannon " . On 3 July 2009 Administrators agreed to a Company Voluntary Arrangement ( CVA ) with previous shareholders and creditors . Gannon took over as manager at Scottish Premier League side Motherwell , causing Stockport fans to worry that he would be poaching Stockport 's young players in the forthcoming weeks . Gary Ablett , former manager of Liverpool reserves , was appointed manager on 8 July 2009 following talks with the ( prospective ) new owners , although they had still not taken over , and in fact never did take over the club . In March 2010 it was announced that a new consortium , the ' 2015 Group ' , had been given exclusivity to work towards a takeover of the club . 
 = = = 2010 – present = = = 
 The 2015 Group was approved by the Football League at its May 2010 meeting , On 17 June 2010 at an 11pm press conference , the takeover of Stockport County by the group was announced . It was also revealed that Ablett had been relieved of his duties as manager after one season in charge , which saw the club relegated from the third division of the English Football League , ( League One ) , with five wins from 46 league matches . It was widely reported that Gannon , who was made redundant in April 2009 , would return to the club , but he decided to take a break from the game . Following the takeover of the club by the 2015 Group , the consortium pledged to " rebuild the club from top to bottom " . 
 On 12 July 2010 , former Carlisle United manager Paul Simpson was unveiled as Ablett 's successor as the new manager of the club at a press conference at Edgeley Park . Simpson 's assistant manager was Peter Ward , who was previously assistant manager at the club between 2005 and 2009 under Gannon , and who also played over 100 games for the club in the 1990s . On 4 January 2011 Simpson was sacked , his place taken by Peter Ward on a caretaker basis . Ward was replaced by Ray Mathias after 12 games and two wins . Stockport 's relegation from the Football League after 106 years was confirmed after a 2 – 0 away defeat against Crewe Alexandra . 
 The 2011 – 12 season started with the team appointing Ray Mathias as permanent manager . However , before any matches took place , he was replaced by former Liverpool , Newcastle United , Bayern Munich and German international midfielder Dietmar Hamann . This was after Liverpool @-@ based businessman Tony Evans attempted an ultimately unsuccessful takeover of the club . 
 Hamann did poorly , winning just three games out of 19 , and resigned in November citing the failed takeover as the reason . He was replaced by Gannon , who returned to the club as Director of Football and First Team Manager through the ' Your Town Your Team ' Group . 
 In Gannon 's first match back at the club , the team lost a match 2 – 1 to joint @-@ leaders Fleetwood Town , who achieved a record attendance in the fixture at Highbury . Gannon managed Stockport to their first back @-@ to @-@ back wins in over three years , since his last stint as manager , with successive 1 – 0 victories over Wrexham and Darlington . Gannon steered Stockport away from the drop zone , winning eight of the last 15 league games – when the side had only managed to win nine games throughout the whole of the 2010 – 11 campaign – to finish 16th in the final table . Gannon again focused on youth development , inducing young players such as Danny Whitehead , Cameron <unk> , Danny Hattersley and Ian <unk> into the starting eleven . County regained sole tenancy of their Edgeley Park stadium for the first time in nine years from the beginning of the 2012 – 13 season , after Sale Sharks relocated for a second time , this time sharing with Salford City Reds at Barton . 
 On 15 January 2013 former <unk> magazine editor Ryan McKnight was named as the new Chief Executive Officer at the club , becoming the youngest CEO in UK football . Fourteen months into his second spell at Edgeley Park and with County in the relegation zone , Gannon was fired as Stockport County boss following the 3 – 1 home defeat by Mansfield Town on 16 January 2013 . He was replaced by <unk> <unk> , who initially saw an upturn in results , but left the position himself two months later following a poor run that left the club in serious danger of relegation to the Conference North . Ian Bogie in turn succeeded <unk> , but was unable to turn the club 's form around , and they were relegated to the Conference North on the final day after a defeat to title challengers Kidderminster Harriers . 
 Former Vice @-@ Chairman Spencer Fear made an offer to the shareholders in later August 2013 , claiming that he would " write off his loans to the club , in exchange for the remaining shareholders to do likewise " . The board took this proposal on board and stated it was a beneficiary of the football club . Stockport gained one point from their first four games of the 2013 – 14 season , which led to Bogie 's resignation as manager on 31 August , with the club second @-@ bottom of the Conference North . Alan Lord then took charge of the team in a caretaker capacity . Ryan McKnight announced his resignation from the position of CEO at the football club on 8 April 2014 , stating he would leave in early May 2014 . Alan Lord remained in the manager 's position until he stepped down to become the club director of football , three games before the end of the 2014 – 15 season . 
 In the summer of 2015 Neil Young was named as Stockport 's new permanent manager after having previous successes and experience in the Conference North . He would however be sacked on 12 January 2016 ( along with other members of his backroom staff ) after a poor recent record . A week later Jim Gannon returned to Edgeley Park for a third spell as manager , following a successful period at Northwich Victoria . 
 = = Future aspirations = = 
 In February 2015 , The Stockport County board of directors issued an open statement about the future aspirations of the football club , named as the ' Moving Forward ' Document . This document focused on four key <unk> stability , sustainability , stadium and success @-@ and outlined the following aspirations for the next five years : 
 Return to the football league and full @-@ time status by 2020 . Potentially consider full @-@ time status upon return to the Conference National 
 <unk> £ 1.5m in commercial revenue in the next five years 
 Have a credible plan in place to again own Edgeley Park : 
 Edgeley Park was purchased by the local authority five months after the ' moving forward ' document was released . Stockport County are currently still renting the ground 
 <unk> and develop a permanent training ground before 2020 
 Maintain regular communication with the Supporters Group 
 Edgeley Park being a protected asset and as such not being used to leverage debt against the club 
 = = Colours , crests and traditions = = 
 Stockport County 's traditional kit colours are blue and white , although they have played in other colours throughout their history . Originally competing in blue and white striped jerseys and white shorts , they experimented with red and white stripes in the early 1900s and from the mid @-@ 1930s to mid @-@ 1960s played in white jerseys and black shorts . No set pattern has been established for the club 's use of blue and white as main colours , as they have played at various times in a white jersey with a blue band and blue shorts and a blue jersey with white pin stripes and white shorts . They made a short experiment with an Argentina @-@ style kit , light blue and white stripes with black shorts , after the 1978 World Cup . This was abandoned after the outbreak of the Falklands War , and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s . County marked their 125th anniversary during 2008 by bringing in a third kit – a gold colour with black trim . The kit was worn on 17 occasions , all away trips . The strip was retired ' undefeated ' at the end of the year , having been worn for 13 victories and 4 draws . The kit was also worn during a match against Chester City which was abandoned after 59 minutes . 
 The club crest , which was used for many years until 2010 when the club exited administration , was based on the achievement of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport . It was altered in 2006 to resemble the town 's arms more closely , including the Latin motto Animo et Fide , which loosely translated , means With Courage and Faith . The blue shield is taken from the coat of arms of the ' de <unk> ' family , from whom Stockport derives its name . The twin @-@ towered castle above the shield is Stockport Castle , which stood until 1775 . 
 After the completion by the 2015 Group takeover of the club , a new crest was adopted . It was still based on the Stockport coat of arms , though the Animo et Fide motto was removed , along with a patch of green at the base of the badge ; the flag of Cheshire , featuring a sword and three <unk> , replaced the golden lozenges and <unk> in the shield . The medals hanging from the lion 's rampant ( which represented Cheshire and Lancashire , owing to Stockport 's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties ) were removed . It also saw the return of a football on the shield . This change was made in part because as of the 2010 – 11 season , Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council . 
 The crest was altered in 2011 to re @-@ include the town motto . The new version added two white ribbons – one at the top , with Animo et Fide , and one at the bottom with Stockport County F.C .. In addition , the football was again removed from the shield . The Stockport County Supporters ' Co - Operative used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo . County 's kit was supplied by local manufacturer Umbro who supplied all three of County 's kit for the 2013 – 14 season , replacing Nike , thus making County the only senior club in the UK to wear the Umbro strip in the 2013 – 14 season . For the start of the 2014 – 15 season , County again changed their kit manufacturer , this time from Umbro to Spanish @-@ based manufacturer Joma which supplied County with a new Home , Away and Third kit along with training wear .

 Heaton Norris Rovers originally played home matches at the Heaton Norris Recreation Ground , then at various locations in Stockport until settling at a park on Green Lane , Heaton Norris , in 1889 . The nearby Nursery Inn served as the team 's home , with players using a barn as changing rooms . Green lane remained the clubs home for its first two seasons in the Football League . 
 In 1902 the club required a larger ground and moved to Edgeley Park , then home of the rugby league club Stockport , who went out of business three years later . Green Lane was retained for use by the club 's reserve team , and one further first team game was played at the ground on 18 April 1903 when Edgeley Park was being used by the rugby club . The site was later used for housing . Stockport County have played home games at Edgeley Park since the start of the 1902 – 03 season , celebrating the centenary in 2002 . 
 In late 2000 the chairman considered moving the club to Maine Road , the former home of rivals Manchester City . The potential move was unpopular with supporters , and protests were staged after it was suggested that the club would change its name to Man @-@ Stock County after the move . Ultimately Manchester City Council decreed that Sale Sharks would make better tenants . Maine Road has since been demolished to make way for a housing estate and Edgeley Park was then shared with Sale whose Parent Company Cheshire Sports owned the ground . 
 There was one again rumour that Stockport would leave Edgeley Park in 2012 ; which was dismissed by then chairman Lord Peter Snape , before Sale Sharks confirmed that they would be moving to Salford City Reds ' new stadium . This meant that Stockport County would again be the only tenants at Edgeley Park , having sole use of the pitch and various revenue @-@ generating aspects of the stadium . The Stockport County board then negotiated a 65 % rent reduction in November 2012 . On 23 May 2012 , it was announced that Stockport County were to rename the Main Stand " The Danny Bergara Stand " in honour of the late Danny Bergara who managed the team during a successful period in the 1990s . 
 In the summer of 2015 , Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council purchased the stadium in order to prevent it from being demolished and redeveloped . After a plea from fans to safeguard the stadium , an emergency council meeting was held and the stadium was purchased for £ 2 million . It is currently leased back to the football club . 
 = = Support = = 
 With both Manchester United and Manchester City around 7 miles ( 11 km ) from Edgeley Park , Stockport County has always struggled for local support . During the mid @-@ 1960s , the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions , attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs . It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams . It had the opposite effect in places like Stockport , where people had the choice of paying the same price on Saturday afternoon to stand on the terraces and watch Stockport or to watch Manchester City or Manchester United . Stockport devised a solution , moving all their home games to Friday evening kick @-@ offs , which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants . Still , during the 1998 – 99 season , crowds averaged around 20 @,@ 000 less than local rivals Manchester City , who were a division below Stockport at the time . 
 In 2004 , when the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20 @,@ 000 for one of its tour matches in China . Both Manchester United and Barcelona achieved less in their subsequent tour matches in the country in the same year . Stockport were watched by 22 @,@ 000 in <unk> against their then sister side Stockport Tiger Star whom they beat 4 – 0 . It is possible that this high attendance was a result of Stockport County 's association with their affiliate team , and Tiger Stars ' name change to include ' Stockport ' two years previously . 
 Although the club has had notable defeats from 2000 – 01 onwards , crowds have continued to be healthy . During the 2005 – 06 season , home attendances ( that is , given attendances minus away support ) increased slightly on the season before , helped by a 10 @,@ 006 crowd against Carlisle on the final day of the season . That game in particular attracted a large crowd as the town of Stockport supported its team at Edgeley Park . If Stockport had lost that particular game , they would have been relegated for the second successive season , and more significantly , would have been relegated from the Football League for the first time , an embarrassment as the team has competed continuously in the Football League since 1900 . Stockport eventually drew the game with Carlisle and survived the drop , while Carlisle themselves gained the league championship . 
 The 2006 – 07 season saw the club average the fourth highest average attendance in League Two , and was the highest average since the club 's last season in the First Division . The 2007 – 08 season saw a further increase in attendance . Away support increased due to a combination of lower ticket prices , improved results and the proximity of sides such as Bury , Rochdale and Macclesfield Town . During these games Stockport 's away support outnumbering home supporters on a number of occasions . Stockport County had an average away attendance of over 900 , the highest in the league . Only two teams in the league above surpassed this figure . Despite the club 's significant fall from League One to the Conference North , Stockport still attracted a large following , home attendances totalling 66 @,@ 356 for the 2014 – 15 season and an average of 2 @,@ 655 , despite a poor 11th @-@ place finish . The following season the club set a National League North record league attendance with 4 @,@ 797 people attending County 's home fixture with FC United on 5 December . 
 Vocally , the support from Stockport fans has often been cited by managers and players as inspirational and a huge boost to the team during play , with their influence likened to having a twelfth player on the field . Stockport supporters often receive praise from other players and managers , both at home and away , for their vocal support . Between the 2006 – 07 and 2009 – 10 seasons the squad number 12 was allocated to the ' Blue & White Army ' , in reference to the supporters being the team 's 12th man on matchdays . However , for the 2010 – 11 season , the number reverted to one of the players . 
 Stockport fans also have a wide variety of songs , being ranked sixth on <unk> for the number of individual chants . Stockport County fans are known for singing the club 's anthem , " The Scarf My Father Wore " , and similar to Tottenham Hotspur fans , the " Blue & White Army " . In this chant the supporters sing the manager 's name , followed by " blue & white army " , as the team play in blue and white . Songs of the Cheadle End was a CD that a group of Stockport County fans recorded , containing 46 popular fan chants that spanned over four decades . The CD also contained the club 's anthem which was re @-@ recorded in 2011 . 
 Some famous Stockport County fans include BDO darts player Tony O 'Shea , singer @-@ songwriter Daz Sampson and Robin Richards from the band Dutch Uncles . O 'Shea writes an article in the club programme every home match and also wears the club colours in all of his televised darts matches . Sampson became a life member of the Stockport County Supporters Trust after he released " The County Song " , which pays tribute to Stockport County 's Football League record of nine consecutive wins without conceding a goal . 
 = = = Supporters ' groups = = = 
 Currently there are two active supporters ' groups which work in conjunction with each other : Help the Hatters is a group of unpaid volunteers who raise money for the club and help the maintenance and upkeep of Edgeley Park . They also helped organise the Players Fund , which is a fund used to buy ( or help pay wages ) of young players . In the past The Players Fund has helped in the development of Rhys Turner ( who earned a move to Oldham Athletic ) , Scott Duxbury , Bobby Lofthouse , Chris Churchman , Matthew Todd and Connor Hancock . The players fund is also used to give the Stockport County Supporters Co @-@ Operative shares in the football club 
 The Stockport County Supporters Co @-@ Operative ( Formerly The Stockport County Supporters Trust ) is the other active supporters ' group where there is a £ 12 annual membership fee . The Supporters Co @-@ Operative 's aim is to give the club 's greatest asset – the fans – a voice ; as well as a stake in the football club through its Guardian Account . The Supporters Co @-@ Op also assists in running the Stockport County Appearance Number ( <unk> ) Scheme where every player who has played a senior professional game is recognised with a unique framed certificate and a number which show their position in the list of players to make their debut for the club . 
 = = Rivalries = = 
 " Stockport County FC is keen to maintain good relations with all clubs – including those which its supporters don 't like very much . So you 'll have to ask County fans to name their rivals . " 
 As the two nearby Manchester clubs have rarely been in the same division as Stockport , there is very little rivalry with either club . Despite the two Manchester clubs attracting a number of supporters from the Stockport area , Stockport County had a rivalry with Manchester City between 1997 and 2002 , when the two clubs spent three out of five seasons in the same division and for one season Stockport were actually a division higher than City . 
 The 1997 – 98 season saw Stockport County and Manchester City meet in a Football League game for the first time in 88 years ; Stockport County were victors at home , beating Manchester City 3 – 1 , due to goals from Paul Cook , Alun Armstrong and Brett Angell . Manchester City defeated Stockport County 4 – 1 at Maine Road in the return fixture ; however , this did not prevent them from being relegated to the third tier , meaning that the 1998 – 99 season became the first season in which Stockport County competed at a higher level than Manchester City . 
 Rivalries were renewed in 1999 – 2000 following Manchester City 's promotion back to the second tier . Stockport County beat Manchester City at Maine Road for the first time in history ( 1999 – 2000 ) due to an equaliser from ex @-@ City youngster Alan Bailey and the winning goal from the penalty spot by Tony Dinning . Manchester City were also defeated by Stockport County in 2001 – 02 , when 2 late goals from John Hardiker meant that City were prevented from gaining 100 points in their quest for the Division One title . Stockport County and Manchester City met six times between 1997 and 2002 , with Stockport County winning three times , losing once and drawing twice . 
 In their days in the Football League the club has had local rivalries with Oldham Athletic , Crewe Alexandra , Bury , Rochdale and Macclesfield Town . For historical reasons , County 's main rivalries are with more distant neighbours Burnley and Stoke City . The rivalries with Burnley and Stoke City are largely fueled by meetings in the early 1990s , including the Football League play @-@ offs final and Football League Trophy final being played against each club respectively – both of which Stockport lost . 
 According to the last Football Fans Census in 2003 , Burnley , Manchester City and Stoke City are cited as Stockport County fans ' biggest rivals . This would no longer be the case , as a little over a decade later Stockport has fallen into non @-@ league football whilst all three of their supposed rivals were in the Premier League ( Manchester City being champions in 2012 and 2014 ) . In the club 's present league , their closest geographical rivals would be Curzon Ashton , Stalybridge Celtic and FC United .

 = Grand Crimean Central Railway = 
 The Grand Crimean Central Railway was a military railway built in 1855 during the Crimean War by Great Britain . Its purpose was to supply ammunition and provisions to Allied soldiers engaged in the siege of Sevastopol who were stationed on a plateau between Balaklava and Sevastopol . It also carried the world 's first hospital train . 
 The railway was built at cost and without any contract by a partnership of English railway contractors led by Samuel Morton Peto . Within three weeks of the arrival of the fleet carrying materials and men the railway had started to run and in seven weeks 7 miles ( 11 km ) of track had been completed . The railway was a major factor leading to the success of the siege . After the end of the war the track was sold and removed . 
 = = The start of the siege = = 
 Britain and France declared war on Russia on 28 March 1854 in support of the Ottoman Empire . By the late summer of 1854 the British , led by Lord Raglan , with their French and Turkish allies decided that a siege of the Black Sea port of Sevastopol , held by the Russians , would be the best method of forcing an end to the war . 
 After landing their forces to the north of Sevastopol , the British set up a base in the narrow harbour of Balaclava , about 8 miles ( 13 km ) south of Sevastopol , in September 1854 . Most of the land between Balaclava and Sevastopol was a plateau about 600 feet ( 183 m ) above sea level . The towns were connected by a road which was little more than a track . This travelled northwards , rising slightly to the village of Kadikoi about 1 mile ( 2 km ) from Balaclava . It then turned west , climbing steeply to the plateau via the Col of Balaclava . The French were supplied from the harbour at <unk> . 
 During the early part of October , the British troops with their supplies and artillery made their way with difficulty up the road to prepare for the siege . When they were all in place the First Bombardment took place , starting on October 17 . It had been expected that the bombardment would be effective and that the siege would be short @-@ lived ; certainly over before the winter . However , the Russians blew up one of the French magazines and the damage done by British gunfire was soon repaired . The British were running out of ammunition and supplies , winter was approaching and with the onset of bad weather the road became virtually impassable . Supplies were arriving at the crowded port of Balaclava but it was impossible to convey them to the besieging troops who were increasingly suffering from disease , frostbite and malnutrition . Conditions in Balaclava itself were also deteriorating .

 News of these conditions was relayed to Britain , mainly by William Howard Russell , special correspondent of The Times . Hearing the news , Samuel Morton Peto , one of the leading railway contractors of the day , offered with his partners Edward Betts and Thomas Brassey , to build at cost , without any contract or personal advantage , a railway to transport supplies from the port of Balaclava to the troops outside Sevastopol . They promised to have a railroad at work in three weeks after landing at Balaclava . The offer was accepted and the contractors began to obtain supplies , to purchase or hire ships , and to recruit the men , who included specialists and navvies . The fleet set sail on December 21 and arrived at the beginning of February . 
 Meanwhile , James Beatty , who had played an important part in working with Peto 's partnership to build the European and North American Railway , was recruited as chief engineer . The line was surveyed by Donald Campbell , who had also worked on the European and North American Railway . Campbell 's first task was to create a wharf at Balaclava where the railway materials could be unloaded , with a yard adjacent . He planned for the track to pass along the middle of the main street of the town . It then went through a gorge at the north of the town close to the water 's edge and over swampy ground to the village of Kadikoi . From here , the railway had to rise some 500 feet ( 152 m ) to the top of the plateau . Of the routes available , Campbell chose to follow the existing road . Although at parts its gradient was as steep as 1 in 7 , Campbell managed find a route with a maximum gradient of 1 in 14 . A stationary engine would be required at the top of this stretch to pull the railway carriages up the incline . Once on the plateau , the ground was rough but fairly level and here it presented fewer problems . Lord Raglan 's headquarters were at the top of the col , and it was decided that a depot should be constructed here .
