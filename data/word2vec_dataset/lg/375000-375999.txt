 Cape Verde competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics which were held in London , United Kingdom from 27 July to 12 August 2012 . The country 's participation at London marked its fifth appearance in the Summer Olympics since its debut in 1996 . The delegation included Ruben Sança , a long @-@ distance runner ; Lidiane Lopes , a sprinter ; and Adysângela Moniz , a judoka . Moniz and Sança were also selected as the flag bearers for the opening and closing ceremonies respectively . Of the three Cape Verdean athletes , only Moniz progressed further than the first round .

 Cape Verde participated in five Summer Olympic games between its debut in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta , US and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London . The highest number of Cape Verdean athletes participating in a summer games is three in the 1996 games in Atlanta , US , the 2004 games in Athens , Greece and in the 2012 games in London . No Cape Verdean athlete has ever won a medal at the Olympics . Three athletes from Cape Verde were selected to compete in the London games ; Ruben Sança in the track and field 5000 m , Lidiane Lopes in the track and field 100 m and Adysângela Moniz in the judo + 78kg .

 = St. Michael 's Cathedral , Qingdao = 
 St. Michael 's Cathedral ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> Mí <unk> <unk> <unk> ; German : <unk> St. Michael ) , also called the Zhejiang Road Catholic Church ( <unk> ) , which is abbreviated by locals to simply the " Catholic Church " ( <unk> ) is a Catholic church in Qingdao ( also known as Tsingtao ) , Shandong Province , China and is the seat of the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Qingdao . It is located in the oldest part of Qingdao , at 15 Zhejiang Road , on the east side of Zhongshan Road in Shinan District . Built by German missionaries , the cathedral stands at the top of a hill in the center of the old German @-@ built part of the city . It is the largest example of Romanesque Revival architecture in the province , resembling a German cathedral of the 12th century . 
 St. Michael 's Cathedral is the product of a strong German presence in Shandong Province in the 19th and early 20th centuries . In the mid @-@ 19th century the European powers forcibly opened China to foreign trade . The Divine Word Missionaries built a church in the Jiaozhou Bay concession in Shandong in 1902 , and in 1934 erected the cathedral , which remained nominally under their administration until 1964 . In 1942 it came under the control of the Japanese Army , returning to Chinese control when the Japanese left Qingdao in 1945 . In the early 1950s , all foreign missionaries , including the Bishop of Qingdao , were either imprisoned or expelled from China , and during the Cultural Revolution ( 1966 – 1976 ) the cathedral was defaced and abandoned . In 1981 , it was repaired by the government and reopened for services , and in 1992 it was listed as a Provincial Historic Building by the government of Shandong Province . 
 = = History = = 
 After China 's defeat in the First Opium War , the country was forcibly opened to foreign trade by a number of treaties collectively referred to as the Unequal Treaties . Following the Treaty of Nanjing ( 1842 ) , the British established the first treaty ports . Following China 's concession to the British Empire , other foreign powers including France , the United States , Portugal , Germany , Japan , and Russia won concessions as well . Foreigners , who were centered in foreign sections of the cities , enjoyed legal extraterritoriality as stipulated in the Unequal Treaties . Foreign clubs , racecourses , and churches were established in major treaty ports . Some of these port areas were directly leased by foreign powers , such as the concessions in China , effectively removing them from the control of local governments . 
 = = = German presence in Qingdao = = = 
 In the early 1890s , the German Empire had been considering occupying Jiaozhou Bay ( " Jiaozhou " is romanized as Kiaochow , <unk> or Kiao @-@ Chau in English and Kiautschou in German ) for building its first naval base in East Asia in order to expand into the interior of Shandong . In 1891 the Qing government decided to make Qingdao ( commonly spelled " Tsingtao " ) defensible against naval attack and began to improve the existing fortifications of the town . German naval officials observed and reported on this Chinese activity during a formal survey of Jiaozhou Bay in May 1897 . In November 1897 , the German Navy seized Jiaozhou Bay under the pretext of ensuring that reparations were paid for the murder of two German Catholic missionaries in the province . In the spring of 1898 , the German government signed a treaty that allowed the Germans to lease an area of 540 square kilometres ( 130 @,@ 000 acres ; 210 sq mi ) for 99 years ( or until 1997 , as the British did in Hong Kong 's New Territories ) , to construct a railway to Jinan , the capital of Shandong province , and to exploit coalfields along the railroad . 
 The Kiautschou Bay concession , as it became known , existed from 1898 to 1914 . With an area of 552 square kilometres ( 136 @,@ 000 acres ; 213 sq mi ) , it was located in the imperial province of Shandong ( alternatively romanized as Shantung or Shan @-@ tung in English and <unk> in German ) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) in northern China . Tsingtao ( Qingdao ) was its administrative center . After the farmers and fishermen of the Chinese village sold their buildings and land and resettled in the rural communities further east , the Germans began to develop the area . Wide streets , solid housing areas , government buildings , electrification throughout , a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply were improvements that transformed the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao into a modern German town . In a short time the area had the highest density of schools and per capita student enrollment in all of China ; primary , secondary and vocational schools were funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions . 
 The cathedral was built by the Divine Word Missionaries ( abbreviated " SVD , " from their Latin name : <unk> <unk> Divini ) , the first German Catholic missionary society . The order was founded in 1875 " for the propagation of the Catholic religion among pagan nations , " at Steyl ( today in the Limburg Province of the Netherlands ) , by German Catholic priests fleeing the Kulturkampf . The society 's first mission was established in 1882 in southern Shantung , a district of more than 10 million people , which contained 158 Catholics . At the time , the area was part of the Apostolic Vicariate of Shantung , managed by Italian Franciscans , who were tasked with rebuilding the earlier Catholic mission work . However , the mission work proceeded slowly , due to insufficient personnel and resources . The southern half of the province , in particular , had been all but neglected . Consequently , it was transferred to the SVD on December 2 , 1885 , and became the Vicariate Apostolic of Southern Shan @-@ tung . The new Vicariate Apostolic was headquartered in Yanzhou , Shandong and headed by Bishop Johann Baptist von Anzer , SVD , who led it until November 24 , 1903 . By 1907 , the mission numbered 35 @,@ 378 Catholics and 36 @,@ 367 catechumens , and by 1924 , 106 @,@ 000 Catholics and 44 @,@ 000 catechumens . The SVD 's presence in Qingdao was first recorded when the mission purchased land there in 1899 and began building a mission hall . 
 = = = Design and construction = = = 
 In autumn 1898 Bishop von Anzer had Father Franz Bartels appointed as pastor in Qingdao . Bishop von Anzer also commissioned Bartels with planning and constructing the Catholic mission . Bartels initially stayed in a house that was part of a Taoist temple . Adjacent to his house he had a provisional chapel built which served as a place of worship / service for the European inhabitants of Qingdao until 1902 when a mission hall with a chapel was built . Major <unk> von Lossow , commander of the Third Sea Battalion which was stationed in Qingdao , ordered about a hundred of his men to attend services every Sunday . 
 On a hill chosen by Bishop von Anzer , Father Bartels purchased some land on Qufu Road , having a printing house and the SVD mission hall erected in 1902 . The mission hall was converted to a school in 1922 , and was operating as of May 2010 . 
 The Holy Ghost Convent was also built on the same hill , occupied by Franciscan sisters who worked as nurses and teachers . 
 The cathedral 's original architect ( commissioned by Bishop Augustin <unk> ) designed a three @-@ aisled Gothic church , but the World War I conquest of Qingdao by the Japanese on November 16 , 1914 , put an end to the cathedral plans . The city reverted to Chinese rule in December 1922 , under control of the Republic of China . The Vicariate Apostolic of Southern Shan @-@ tung was renamed the Vicariate Apostolic of <unk> on December 13 , 1924 , and on February 22 , 1925 , the Apostolic Prefecture of Qingdao was established from its territory , with Bishop Georg Weig , SVD , appointed prefect on March 18 of that same year . On June 14 , 1928 , it was elevated to a Vicariate Apostolic . When construction resumed , the original Gothic plan no longer seemed appropriate for the modern townscape of Qingdao . Father Alfred <unk> designed the present neo @-@ Romanesque structure , built during the tenure of Bishop Weig , who is entombed in the cathedral . 
 Construction began on May 5 , 1931 , under Brother <unk> <unk> , SVD , who became ill and died on September 12 , 1931 ; Arthur <unk> , a German architect living in Qingdao who had already completed several projects for the SVD , took over as construction superintendent . Construction was frustrated in 1933 , when Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany and prohibited the transfer of money overseas . The diocese independently shouldered the cost of finishing the cathedral . This required a number of design changes to reduce costs . The changes are evident in drawings published before completion of construction , which show the roofs of the towers as bell @-@ shaped . However , the roofs of the completed structure were changed to spires . Construction was finished in 1934 , and the cathedral was consecrated on October 28 that year . 
 Some sources state that St. Michael 's Cathedral was originally named " St. Emil 's Church " . A Latin inscription over the tomb of Bishop Weig states that the cathedral was consecrated to St. Michael the Archangel in 1934 . In addition , a photo taken in 1935 , currently in the German Federal Archives is labeled " St. Michaels Kirche " ( St. Michael 's Church ) , and authoritative secondary print sources make no mention of " St. Emil 's Church " . 
 = = = 1938 – 1949 : occupation , liberation , and civil war = = = 
 The Japanese reoccupied Qingdao in January 1938 . Bishop Thomas Tien Ken @-@ sin , SVD was appointed Vicariate Apostolic of Qingdao , in November 1942 , as Bishop Georg Weig had died the year before . That year , the Japanese placed a large sign over the main door of the cathedral that read " Under Management of the Japanese Army " . On August 15 , 1945 , Japan surrendered to Allied forces , officially ending World War II , and in September 1945 , Qingdao was liberated by forces of the Kuomintang , restoring the government of the Republic of China . The following year , on February 18 , 1946 , Bishop Tien was elevated to Cardinal , becoming the first Chinese Cardinal and to date the only SVD Cardinal . He traveled to Vatican City to accept the honor . His Vicariate Apostolic was elevated to the Diocese of Qingdao on April 11 . Upon his return on May 27 , he was greeted by representatives of the government of Shandong Province , who had arranged a welcome in his honor , with the United States Marine Band playing outside the main entrance of the cathedral . The Marine Band was attached to Naval Forces Western Pacific , headquartered in Qingdao at the time . During the Civil War period ( 1946 – 1949 ) , missionaries in Shandong Province experienced growing tensions with the Communists , spurring one of them , Father Augustin Olbert , SVD to write : 
 The Reds do not slacken and will in the end remain victorious . Almost the entire province is in their hands . For the time being they still give face , but when they are firmly established , they will no doubt show us their teeth , as they are already doing in some areas . We are facing the future with much anxiety . Most missionaries are convinced that , once the Reds are in power , they will expel us all . 
 Father Olbert was appointed Bishop of Qingdao two years later . 
 On June 2 , 1949 , the People 's Liberation Army entered Qingdao and both the city and Shandong Province have since been under Communist control . Bishop Tien fled to Taiwan with the Kuomintang government . 
 = = = 1949 – 1976 : Under Mao = = = 
 Soon after the Communists assumed control , a combination of assertive nationalism and socialist ideology led to the eradication of the Western presence in China , including Western culture and products . " The denunciation of anything Western as ' capitalist , ' ' bourgeois ' and representative of the ' imperialist world ' reached a peak during the ideological extremism of the Korean War ( 1950 – 1953 ) when the final vestiges of the Western economic and cultural presence were eradicated . " Missionary and Communist ambitions simply were irreconcilable and the wide ideological gap could not be bridged . The stage had been set for the Communists ' catastrophic assault on the missionary enterprise during the Civil War period ( 1946 – 1949 ) and the expulsion of virtually all foreigners in the early 1950s . Foreign missionaries who were suspected of being spies were arrested . Missionary institutes funded by foreign money were closed down and all foreign missionaries expelled from China . The SVD mission was not spared this fate . In 1951 , the Diocese of Qingdao 's Bishop Augustin Olbert , SVD was arrested , served 22 months in prison , and was then deported to Germany in 1953 . Although the cathedral was closed by the government , Bishop Olbert remained Bishop of Qingdao until his death in 1964 . Native Chinese clergy were not spared the government 's Marxian contempt for religion during this period . Future Bishop of Qingdao Li Mingshu was sent to prison the same year Bishop Olbert was deported , and not released from labor camps until 1968 . Sweeping arrests of Chinese bishops , priests , sisters and laity did not begin , however , until 1955 . Afterwards , the Catholic resistance movement , encountering mass arrests and sentences to forced labor , was forced underground . Professor Jean @-@ Paul Wiest , Research Associate at the Centre for the Study of Religion and Chinese Society wrote : " The witness of Bishop Gong <unk> of Shanghai and many others who chose jail , labor camps , and even death for the sake of their faith and their loyalty to the pope would sustain countless people in the years ahead . " 
 By late 1957 , due to the prior expulsion of foreign clergy and the subsequent imprisonment of Chinese clergy , 120 out of 145 dioceses and prefectures apostolic were without <unk> . The Diocese of Qingdao went without an ordinary until the state @-@ run Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association consecrated and appointed Bishop Paul Han Xirang , OFM without papal sanction in 1988 . 
 The cathedral was badly damaged during the Cultural Revolution which lasted from 1966 to 1971 . During this time St. Michael 's Cathedral was defaced by the Red Guards . The crosses topping the twin steeples were removed by the Red Guards , with two men falling to their deaths during the removal . An account of the cathedral 's defacement is translated as follows : 
 One day , scaffolding was tied to the church steeples . People said that the crosses would be removed . The news spread throughout the city . Numerous people watched from windows , from the streets , from the beaches , and from the mountaintops as several small , ghostlike figures climbed up to the crosses . Against the blue sky they opened a saw . It was said that by evening , two people had fallen from the tower and died on the spot . People also say that this church held one of the greatest pipe organs in China . They say that when it played , the whole city could hear its music . But this rare treasure was also destroyed by the Red Guards . 
 The next morning , seeing the towers of the church , the steeple had been denuded , and the towers were bald , like the shaved heads of criminals . The onlookers felt extremely uncomfortable , as if the whole area had been corrupted ; made evil . Not long after that , I occasionally passed by the church and was astonished to see the topped crosses : what originally appeared to be two thin needles [ when viewed from the towers ] was actually the size of two coarse , heavy men , one taller than the other . Since then , the cathedral has become a warehouse . 
 The original crosses were rescued by local Catholics and buried in the hills . The 2400 @-@ pipe organ destroyed by the Red Guards had been one of the two largest in Asia . 
 = = = Restoration = = = 
 The Chinese government subsequently repudiated the Cultural Revolution . A major document presented at the September 1979 Fourth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee , gave a " preliminary assessment " of the entire 30 @-@ year period of Communist rule . At the plenum , party Vice Chairman Ye <unk> declared the Cultural Revolution " an appalling catastrophe " and " the most severe setback to [ the ] socialist cause since [ 1949 ] . " The Chinese government 's condemnation of the Cultural Revolution culminated in the Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People 's Republic of China , adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China . This stated that " Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary , strategist and theorist . It is true that he made gross mistakes during the " cultural revolution " , but , if we judge his activities as a whole , his contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his mistakes . His merits are primary and his errors secondary . " 
 The change in prevailing political views was favorable to St. Michael 's Cathedral ; the Chinese government funded the cathedral 's restoration efforts . New crosses were manufactured for the cathedral 's restoration , and " after several years of repair , [ the cathedral ] was re @-@ opened in April 1981 " for religious services . In May 1999 the church was opened to the general public , allowing entry when Mass or other services are not being celebrated . In 2005 , city workers repairing water pipes accidentally found the original crosses buried on Longshan Road , not far from the cathedral . They are currently stored in the north transept . The cathedral has been listed on the register of Provincial Historic Buildings by the government of Shandong Province since 1992 . 
 The change in prevailing political views also allowed for rapprochement with Chinese clergy formerly imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution . In 1985 Li Mingshu was allowed an official post teaching at the seminary of Jinan . In 1994 he was transferred to the service of the Diocese of Qingdao , and was appointed the Bishop of Qingdao in 2000 . Upon his consecration as Bishop , he took the name " Joseph " .

 The cathedral stands atop a hill in the center of what was the original settlement of the city of Qingdao , at 15 Zhejiang Road ( formerly Bremen Strasse ) on the east side of Zhongshan Road in Shinan District . The church is built in the historic style of German Romanesque . It is cruciform in plan , having a nave flanked by a lower single aisle on either side , crossed by a transept , and with a semi @-@ circular apse projecting at the east end . 
 The cathedral is 65 @.@ 9 metres ( 216 ft ) long and the transept is 37 @.@ 6 metres ( 123 ft ) wide , with an exterior height of 18 metres ( 59 ft ) . The towers are 56 metres ( 184 ft ) in height , and have Rhenish helm spires , each topped by a 4 @.@ 5 @-@ metre ( 15 ft ) cross . One tower contains a single large bell , and the other three smaller bells . 
 The west front rises to a balustrade between the towers at 30 metres ( 98 ft ) . It has three portals , with a rose window above the central one . The building materials are reinforced concrete and granite , and the roofs are red tiles . 
 In his book , German Architecture in China , Warner Torsten writes of the cathedral : 
 According to residents ] the cathedral is far too large for the scale of Qingdao . Its position on top of a hill makes this even more evident . Perhaps the idea was to produce a powerful building to hold its own with the Protestant Church , which for 20 years had been the largest religious building in Qingdao , or perhaps the intention was to outstrip the 46 metre @-@ high towers of the Franciscan church in Jinan . The towers of the cathedral in Qingdao were higher than all the other churches in the major cities of Northern China – Tianjin , Beijing , Dalian , or Jinan . They dominate the silhouette of Qingdao ; they are particularly impressive from a ship entering the harbour . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The total floor area of St. Michael 's Cathedral is 2 @,@ 740 square metres ( 29 @,@ 500 sq ft ) . While the exterior of the cathedral is neo @-@ Romanesque , the interior has piers and arches of a Classical revival style . Above the 12 @-@ metre ( 39 ft ) high nave and transept is an unvaulted coffered ceiling . Narrow vaults over the two aisles are so much lower than the nave that they function like <unk> . The nave can hold 1 @,@ 000 people . The baptismal font and statues have captions in English and Chinese . 
 The nave extends into a high vaulted apse ( pictured right ) at the east end . The aisles on either side of the nave are continued around the apse , making an ambulatory . Seven chandeliers are suspended from the ceiling over the main aisle . Beneath the chancel arch stands the high altar , under an ornate baldachin . The ciborium over the high altar bears the Latin words Venite <unk> Dominum , " Come adore the Lord . " Within the sanctuary stands a second , portable , altar , upon which most masses are celebrated . 
 According to Lonely Planet , " The interior is splendid , with white walls , gold piping … and a marvellously painted apse . " 
 The mural painted on the dome of the apse ( pictured right ) depicts Jesus seated on a cloud , red and golden rays radiating out of his golden halo . God the Father , pictured as a white @-@ bearded man with triangular halo , looks down from a cloud above Jesus . A dove with a white halo , representing the Holy Spirit , flies just below God , wings outstretched , completing the Trinity . Above Jesus fly four cherubim . Seated to Jesus ' right is Mary , his mother , and to his left Saint John the Baptist . On the same cloud as Jesus , three angels flank on each side . Slightly below Jesus , Mary , and John , two more flanking angels are depicted kneeling on their own clouds and swinging censers . Under the entire scene , a banner displays Gloria in Excelsis Deo . 
 In 2006 , the construction and installation of a massive 12 @-@ by @-@ 12 @-@ metre ( 39 ft × 39 ft ) Jäger & <unk> pipe organ ( pictured at left ) was commissioned for St. Michael 's Cathedral at a cost of 700 @,@ 000 euros , to be ready in time for the 2008 Olympics . The pipe organ sits upon the choir loft over the west front entrance . 
 The north transept contains three large murals featuring Jesus Christ : Jesus washing St. Peter 's feet , the Sacred Heart , and the Pietà . The north transept also contains the tombs of two bishops . One is of the first Vicar Apostolic of the Vicariate Apostolic of Qingdao , Bishop Georg Weig , SVD who supervised the construction of the cathedral . Bishop Weig 's tombstone shows obvious signs of defacement , being chipped around the edges , and with broken stonework at its base . The other tomb contains part of the ashes of Bishop of Qingdao Paul Han Xirang , OFM , the rest having been buried in his hometown , Han Village , <unk> County , Shandong Province . 
 The south transept also contains three large murals : the Holy child praying , St. Thérèse of Lisieux ( patroness of missions ) , and the Nativity . The north and south arms of the transept each contain two altars .

 In 1959 , when Schaller was only 26 , he traveled to Central Africa to study and live with the mountain gorillas ( Gorilla <unk> <unk> ) of the Virunga Volcanoes . Little was known about the life of gorillas in the wild until the publication of The Mountain Gorilla : Ecology and Behavior in 1963 , that first conveyed to the general public just how profoundly intelligent and gentle gorillas really are , contrary to then @-@ common beliefs . Schaller also , in 1964 , recounted this epic two @-@ year study in The Year of the Gorilla , which also provides a broader historical perspective on the efforts to save one of humankind 's nearest relatives from the brink of extinction . 
 The American zoologist Dian Fossey , with assistance from the National Geographic society and Louis Leakey , followed Schaller 's ground @-@ breaking field research on mountain gorillas in the <unk> . Schaller and Fossey were instrumental in dispelling the public perception of gorillas as brutes , by demonstrably establishing the deep compassion and social intelligence evident among gorillas , and how very closely their behavior parallels that of humans . 
 " No one who looks into a gorilla 's eyes – intelligent , gentle , vulnerable – can remain unchanged , for the gap between ape and human vanishes ; we know that the gorilla still lives within us . Do gorillas also recognize this ancient connection ? " 
 = = Conservation career = = 
 In 1966 , Schaller and his wife traveled to Tanzania to live in the Serengeti , and Schaller conducted one of the first studies of social behavior and movement of Africa 's big cats . 
 In his 1972 work The Tree Where Man Was Born , author Peter Matthiessen described Schaller as " single @-@ minded , not easy to know " . Matthiessen went on to say Schaller was " a stern pragmatist " who " takes a hard @-@ eyed look at almost everything " , " lean and intent " , and in 1978 's The Snow Leopard Matthiessen wrote that by that time , some considered Schaller the world 's finest field biologist . 
 In the fall of 1973 , Schaller went to the remote Himalayan region , 250 miles ( 400 km ) inside <unk> , an area of Nepal occupied by people of the Tibetan culture and ethnicity . Schaller was there to study the Himalayan <unk> , ( blue sheep ) , and possibly glimpse the elusive snow leopard , an animal rarely spotted in the wild . Schaller is one of only two Westerners known to have seen a snow leopard in Nepal between 1950 and 1978 . Accompanying him on the trip was Matthiessen , and as a result of the trip , Matthiessen wrote The Snow Leopard , ( 1978 ) detailing the accounts of their travels and research , which won two U.S. National Book Awards . Schaller is referred to throughout the book as " GS " . 
 In the late 1970s , Schaller spent time in Brazil studying the jaguar , capybara , " alligator " ( caiman ) , and other animals of the region . 
 In 1988 , Schaller and his wife traveled to China 's Chang Tang ( Qian Tang ) region to study the giant panda , and became the first westerners permitted to enter the remote region . Schaller sought to refute the notion that the panda population was declining due to natural bamboo die @-@ offs . Instead , Schaller found the panda 's popularity was leading to its frequent capture , and was the biggest threat to the population . Schaller also found evidence that pandas were originally carnivores , but underwent an evolutionary change to accommodate a diet of bamboo , which is difficult to digest , reducing competition with other animals for food . Since Schaller 's research , the panda population has increased in the wild by 45 percent . During his time in China , Schaller would hand out cards to wildlife hunters that read : " All beings tremble at punishment , to all , life is dear . Comparing others to oneself , one should neither kill nor cause to kill . " Schaller has spent more time in China than he has spent at his home in Connecticut . 
 In 1994 , Schaller and Dr. Alan Rabinowitz were the first scientists to uncover the rare saola , a forest @-@ dwelling bovine in Laos . Later that year , Schaller rediscovered the Vietnamese warty pig , once thought extinct . In 1996 , he located a herd of Tibetan red deer , also thought extinct . 
 In 2003 , Schaller returned to Chang Tang , and found the wildlife in the area had rebounded since his first trip to the region . Most significantly , the wild yak population , which was estimated at only 13 individuals , had grown to over 187 . " The Tibet Forestry Department has obviously made a dedicated and successful effort in protecting the wildlife . " Schaller wrote in a letter to the World Wildlife Fund 's Dawa <unk> . While in Tibet , Schaller worked on researching the rare Tibetan antelope , or <unk> , whose population declined due to trophy hunting for their exotic wool . Working with Tibetan authorities , and the Liz Claiborne and Art Ortenberg Foundation , Schaller helped protect the breeding and calving grounds of the <unk> in the Kunlun mountains of Xinjiang Province . 
 In 2007 , Schaller worked with Pakistan , Afghanistan , Tajikistan , and China to develop a new " Peace Park " , that would protect 20 @,@ 000 miles ( 32 @,@ 000 km ) of habitat for the largest wild sheep species , the Marco Polo sheep . In danger due to their impressive spiral horns , which can measure up to 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) in length , the sheep is sought out as a trophy by international hunters . Schaller 's research in the Pamir Mountains will play an important role in the park 's creation . 
 = = Conservation results = = 
 Schaller 's work in conservation has resulted in the protection of large stretches of area in the Amazon , Brazil , the Hindu Kush in Pakistan , and forests in Southeast Asia . Due in part to Schaller 's work , over 20 parks or preserves worldwide have been established , including Alaska 's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) , the <unk> @-@ <unk> National Park in Nepal , and the <unk> Nature Reserve , one of the world 's most significant wildlife refuges . At over 200 @,@ 000 miles ( 320 @,@ 000 km ) , the Chang Tang Nature Reserve is triple the size of America 's largest wildlife refuge , and was called " One of the most ambitious attempts to arrest the shrinkage of natural ecosystems , " by The New York Times . 
 = = Bigfoot research = = 
 Schaller is one of a few prominent scientists who argue that Bigfoot reports are worthy of serious study . A 2003 Los Angeles Times story described Schaller as a " Bigfoot skeptic " , but he also expressed disapproval for other scientists who do not examine evidence , yet " write [ Bigfoot ] off as a hoax or myth . I don 't think that 's fair . " In a 2003 Denver Post article Schaller said that he is troubled that no Bigfoot remains have ever been uncovered , and no feces samples have been found to allow DNA testing . Schaller notes : " There have been so many sightings over the years , even if you throw out 95 percent of them , there ought to be some explanation for the rest . I think a hard @-@ eyed look is absolutely essential " .

 Schaller has written more than fifteen books on African and Asian mammals , including Serengeti Lion : A Study of Predator – Prey Relations , The Last Panda , and Tibet 's Hidden Wilderness , based on his own studies , and supported by long @-@ term observations of species in their natural habitats . Schaller has also written hundreds of magazine articles , and dozens of books and scientific articles about tigers , jaguars , cheetahs and leopards , as well as wild sheep and goats , rhinoceroses , and flamingos . Over more than five decades , Schaller 's field research has helped shape wildlife protection efforts around the world .

Schaller 's literary honors include the U.S. National Book Award in Science ( for The Serengeti Lion in 1973 ) . In September 2008 , he received the Indianapolis Prize for his work in animal conservation . 
 = Will Venable = 
 William Dion Venable ( born October 29 , 1982 ) is an American professional baseball outfielder in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization . He has also played in MLB for the San Diego Padres and Texas Rangers . Venable is the son of former Major League outfielder Max Venable as well as the older brother of Canadian Football League safety Winston Venable . 
 Venable played basketball for Princeton University , as well as San Rafael High School . He was the second athlete to earn first @-@ team All @-@ Ivy League honors in both baseball and basketball . In the 2005 MLB Draft , the Padres selected Venable in the seventh round . He made his major league debut on August 29 , 2008 , against the Colorado Rockies , collecting his first hit . Although he broke into the Major Leagues as a center fielder , he has played mostly right field since his second season . Venable has frequently batted lead off and has on several occasions come within one hit of the cycle . As of November 2013 , he has finished among the top ten in the National League in triples four times and in stolen bases twice . He has the most Major League Baseball career hits and home runs of any Princeton alumnus . 
 = = Amateur career = = 
 = = = High school = = = 
 Venable was born in 1982 in Marin County , California , at a time when his father Max Venable was a Major League Baseball player for the nearby San Francisco Giants . He grew up travelling around the country with his father and also lived in Japan and the Dominican Republic . In high school , he envisioned himself as more likely to be a professional basketball player than baseball player . Prior to his freshman year , his mother , Molly , objected to him quitting baseball to focus on basketball . As both a high school sophomore and a high school junior , Venable was second @-@ team San Francisco Bay Area All @-@ Metro basketball player for San Rafael High School . He was the Marin County Athletic League ( <unk> ) most valuable player in basketball as a freshman , sophomore and junior . As a sophomore , he led his team to the <unk> League Championship . As a senior , he gave up the responsibility of being point forward . 
 = = = College carer = = = 
 Venable chose to attend Princeton University , not for its academics , but for its tradition of basketball excellence . He respected their tradition of qualifying to participate in the NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship Tournament . During his time at the University he was a part of two teams that qualified for post season play : 2004 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament and 2002 National Invitation Tournament ) . Princeton recruited him as a basketball player . He did not play baseball as a freshman , but his father had directed him to Scott Bradley , Princeton 's baseball coach , during his recruiting visit . 
 Venable , who was a member of the class of 2005 at Princeton University , was the second athlete in Ivy League history ( after his Padres teammate Chris Young ) to be first @-@ team All @-@ Ivy in both basketball and baseball and he played on Ivy League Champion National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Championship tournament participants in both sports . He played in two NCAA Championship tournaments in both sports and earned a B.A. in anthropology . 
 In basketball , he averaged over 10 points and over 30 minutes per game in his 2002 – 03 sophomore season through his 2004 – 05 senior season . 
 Bradley had left the door open for Venable to come take batting practice if he ever had the urge . As a sophomore , at the suggestion of his mother , Venable resumed baseball . He posted modest numbers in his first season , but in 2004 , he hit for a .344 batting average , earned All @-@ Ivy honorable mention , and was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the fifteenth round of the draft ( 439th overall ) . Bradley felt that Major League Baseball scouts undervalued Venable because he did not participate in the Cape Cod League for college baseball players . Thus , instead of signing and giving up his amateur status , Venable returned for his senior season and posted a league leading 9 home runs and runner @-@ up .385 batting average while earning All @-@ League honors . Subsequently , the Padres drafted him in the seventh round ( 215th overall ) ; he was signed by the Padres ' Northeast Scouting Director , Jim Bretz .

 After graduating from Princeton , Venable made his professional debut in minor league baseball with the Arizona League Padres of the Arizona League in 2005 . He hit for a .322 batting average in 15 games and was soon promoted to the Eugene Emeralds of the Single @-@ A Northwest League . 
 In 2006 , Venable was the Padres Minor League Player of the Year . With his father as a team hitting coach , Venable posted a .314 batting average , .389 on @-@ base percentage ( OBP ) , and .477 slugging percentage for the Fort Wayne Wizards of the single @-@ A Midwest League ( MWL ) , which earned him both mid @-@ season and post @-@ season MWL All @-@ star honors . That season he tied for the MWL lead in runs scored and was among the top four Padre farmhands in RBIs , batting average , and stolen bases . Among his highlights for the Wizards were his team @-@ high two grand slams and a five @-@ hit performance . 
 Subsequently , for the 2006 West Oahu <unk> of the Hawaii Winter Baseball , Venable posted a .330 batting average , .390 on @-@ base percentage ( OBP ) , and <unk> slugging percentage . He won the batting title that season and was named league most valuable player . He also led the league in doubles and was second to John <unk> in OBP . In the outfield , Venable made no errors . Before the 2007 season , Venable was listed as the fifth best prospect in the Padres organization by Baseball America , and they named him the # 11 prospect in the league . They also named him as a Baseball America Low @-@ A All @-@ Star . 
 In 2007 , Venable batted .278 with a .337 OBP in 134 games for the San Antonio Missions of the Texas League . This again earned him both mid @-@ season and post @-@ season league All @-@ Star honors . A highlight occurred on May 30 , 2007 , when he hit for the cycle . After the season ended , he was invited to play for the San Diego affiliate in the Arizona Fall League , but he was afflicted with tendinitis in his shoulder and only hit .228 . 
 During 2008 spring training , he had two home runs and eight runs batted in his first twelve at @-@ bats . He then posted a .292 batting average , .361 on @-@ base percentage and <unk> slugging percentage in 120 games for the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League in 2008 .

 Venable had been expected to be a September 2008 call @-@ up , but when Scott Hairston was forced onto the disabled list , Venable was called up ahead of schedule . On August 29 , 2008 , in his debut , he tripled in his first at @-@ bat and came around to score a run . He is the twenty @-@ fifth Princeton alumnus to play in the Major Leagues , but he is the first African @-@ American alumnus . He posted his first Major League home run in his sixth game on September 4 , 2008 , during a 5 – 2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at Miller Park . His only other home run for the 2008 San Diego Padres was also in a victory on the road on September 19 , 2008 in an 11 – 6 victory over the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park . During this game , Venable posted his first three @-@ hit performance and first three @-@ RBI performance . When Venable batted leadoff for the Padres on September 28 , 2008 against Pittsburgh , he became the first Princeton batter to oppose a Princeton pitcher ( Ross Ohlendorf ) . In 2008 , Venable accumulated only 110 Major League at @-@ bats , and rookie year is considered to be the season in which one accumulates his 130th at @-@ bat . He only played centerfield in 2008 . Following the season he played winter baseball in the Dominican Professional Baseball League , where he struggled . 
 Although in 2008 Baseball America projected Venable as an every day starter for the Padres in 2010 , some experts questioned whether he would be a long @-@ term solution in center field for the team . Venable started the 2009 season with the Padres ' Triple @-@ A affiliate , Portland Beavers , but he was recalled by the Padres on June 3 . His father , Max , served as the Beavers ' hitting coach in 2009 . Following the July 5 trade of Scott Hairston to the Oakland Athletics , Venable shared right field with Kyle Blanks . On July 12 against the San Francisco Giants , he had his first home run of the season in his first career four @-@ hit game . Between July 30 and August 5 , he homered in five of seven games . In an August 23 game against the St. Louis Cardinals , he was involved in a bench @-@ clearing incident when Albert Pujols thought he threw an elbow while being tagged out . In 2009 , he posted 12 home runs and tallied 38 runs batted in ( RBI ) , while defensively 493 @.@ 2 of his 643 innings were spent in right field and only 117 in center field . 
 In 2010 , he finished 8th in the National League in triples ( 7 ) , and 9th stolen bases ( 29 ) . He executed some delayed steals by taking off with the toss back to the mound " when neither infielder is covering second and the catcher is nonchalant with the ball after receiving the pitch " . On April 11 against the Atlanta Braves , he had his first career 5 @-@ RBI game , falling a double shy of the first cycle in Padres history . On May 19 , Venable moved into the lead off position in the lineup and he fell a home run shy of the franchise 's first cycle against the Los Angeles Dodgers , going 4 @-@ for @-@ 5 at the plate after getting a triple in the 1st inning and a double in the third . In June 23 , June 25 and 27 , Venable hit tie @-@ breaking home runs in Padre victories against the Florida Marlins and Tampa Bay Rays . On July 3 , he went on the 15 @-@ day disabled list due to back problems . On September 29 against the Chicago Cubs , he stole two potential home runs ( from Alfonso Soriano and Aramis Ramirez ) on deep fly balls . In the game he achieved his career @-@ high 10 @-@ game hitting streak . He also led National League outfielders with 5 errors . He set new career @-@ highs with 13 home runs and 51 RBI . Again , the majority of his innings were in right field ( 600 @.@ 1 of 936 @.@ 1 innings ) . He split his remaining time between left field ( 171 @.@ 2 ) and center field ( 164 @.@ 1 ) . 
 In 2011 , Venable started slowly , hitting only .205 in April and was eventually optioned to the Tucson Padres on May 23 before being recalled on June 9 . At the time of his demotion , he had no home runs and a .224 batting average in 134 at @-@ bats . He was recalled after going 16 @-@ for @-@ 58 with 3 doubles , 3 triples , 3 home runs and 3 stolen bases in 14 games . In one minor league game on May 27 he homered twice against the Salt Lake Bees . On July 20 , Venable scored 3 times in the first two innings as the Padres jumped out to a 13 – 0 lead against the Florida Marlins . In late July , he missed a few games due to back spasms . On August 10 against the New York Mets , Venable had four hits again missing the cycle by a home run when he posted a second double in a ninth inning at bat . On August 21 , <unk> delivered a lead off home run and the game @-@ winning bases @-@ loaded walk @-@ off hit on Trevor Hoffman Day . On September 28 , he got his first grand slam home run against the Chicago Cubs off of Ryan Dempster . For the season , his totals dropped to 9 home runs and 44 RBI with the Padres , and he again totaled 7 triples , this time finishing 10th . He played 662 @.@ 2 of his 793 @.@ 2 innings in right field .

 In 2012 , Venable and Chris <unk> formed a platoon in right field , with Venable getting most of the starts against right @-@ handed pitchers and batting .270 against them . Venable made 80 starts in right , but appeared in a then @-@ career @-@ high 148 games for the year . When not starting in right , he made occasional starts in center and left field and made 26 pinch @-@ hitting appearances . On May 15 , 2012 , Venable had a single , double and triple by the fourth inning against the Washington Nationals , but his 4 @-@ hit effort again fell short of the franchise 's cycle . On May 23 , Venable had his sixth career lead off home run and added a single in the second inning and a double in the fourth against the St. Louis Cardinals . He ended up one hit shy of the cycle for the fifth time , this time a triple . On June 3 , Venable suffered a strained oblique muscle and left the game , missing four more games with the injury . Venable finished the year batting .264 with 9 home runs and 45 RBI . He collected 8 triples , finishing 9th in the league , and also committed 7 errors , tied for first among NL outfielders . 
 Coming into 2013 , Venable was again expected to platoon with <unk> in right , but injuries to center fielder Cameron Maybin and left fielder Carlos Quentin expanded his playing time . He made 68 starts in right and 52 in center and played in a career @-@ high 151 games . Venable entered the season with 401 hits , which was 48 shy of the record for an alumnus of Princeton Tigers Baseball held by Moe Berg . His 46 home runs were already a school best . For the week of August 12 through August 18 , 2013 , Venable won the National League Player of the Week Award . During the week Venable tied his single @-@ game career high with 4 hits , joined the Padres ' 100 @-@ steal club , hit a walk @-@ off home run , made a home run stealing catch and surpassed his previous career best hitting streak by 5 to 15 . It marked his first Player of the Week Award as he hit .406 ( 13 @-@ for @-@ 32 ) with two home runs , two doubles , a triple and seven runs scored . On September 13 , David Hale ( Princeton class of 2011 ) made his major league debut for the Atlanta Braves , and it became the second Princeton vs. Princeton batter @-@ pitcher matchup in major league history . Hale struck out Venable and eight other Padres in his debut for the Braves , setting a franchise debut record . Venable was voted the Padres ' Most Valuable Player for the 2013 season by local baseball writers and other members of the media as he became the 8th player in Padres history to record at least 20 home runs and 20 steals in a season . For the year , Venable hit .268 with 22 home runs and a <unk> on @-@ base plus slugging , all new career highs . He also stole 22 bases and finished tied for 5th in the league with 8 triples . 
 On September 2 , 2013 , Venable signed a two @-@ year contract extension with the Padres to keep him in San Diego through the 2015 season . Venable batted .224 with eight home runs in the 2014 season . His batting average , .288 on @-@ base percentage , .325 slugging percentage , and 38 RBIs were all career lows for a full season . During the 2014 – 15 offseason , the Padres acquired outfielders Matt Kemp , Justin Upton , and Wil Myers , shifting Venable into a reserve role . For the Padres in 2015 , Venable hit .258 with six home runs , 10 doubles , and 11 stolen bases through mid @-@ August .

 = Italian War of 1521 – 26 = 
 The Italian War of 1521 – 26 , sometimes known as the Four Years ' War , was a part of the Italian Wars . The war pitted Francis I of France and the Republic of Venice against the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V , Henry VIII of England , and the Papal States . The conflict arose from animosity over the election of Charles as Emperor in 1519 – 20 and from Pope Leo X 's need to ally with Charles against Martin Luther . 
 The war broke out across Western Europe late in 1521 , when a French – Navarrese expedition attempted to reconquer Navarre while a French army invaded the Low Countries . A Spanish army drove the Navarrese forces back into the Pyrenees , and other Imperial forces attacked northern France , where they were stopped in turn . 
 The Pope , the Emperor , and Henry VIII then signed a formal alliance against France , and hostilities resumed on the Italian Peninsula ; but , with the attention of both Francis and Charles focused on the battleground in northeast France , the conflict in Italy became something of a sideshow . At the Battle of Bicocca on 27 April 1522 , Imperial and Papal forces defeated the French , driving them from Lombardy . Following the battle , fighting again spilled onto French soil , while Venice made a separate peace . The English invaded France in 1523 , while Charles de Bourbon , alienated by Francis 's attempts to seize his inheritance , betrayed Francis and allied himself with the Emperor . A French attempt to regain Lombardy in 1524 failed and provided Bourbon with an opportunity to invade Provence at the head of a Spanish army . 
 Francis himself led a second attack on Milan in 1525 ; his disastrous defeat at the Battle of Pavia , where he was captured and many of his chief nobles were killed , led to the end of the war . With Francis imprisoned in Spain , a series of diplomatic maneuvers centered on his release ensued , including a special French mission sent by Francis ' mother Louise of Savoy to the court of Suleiman the Magnificent that would result in an Ottoman ultimatum to Charles — an unprecedented alignment between Christian and Muslim monarchs that would cause a scandal in the Christian world and lay the foundation for the Franco @-@ Ottoman alliance . Suleiman used the opportunity to invade Hungary in the summer of 1526 , defeating Charles ' allies at the Battle of Mohács ; but , despite these efforts , Francis would sign the Treaty of Madrid , surrendering his claims to Italy , Flanders , and Burgundy . Only a few weeks after his release , however , he repudiated the terms of the treaty , starting the War of the League of Cognac . Although the Italian Wars would continue for another three decades , they would end with France having failed to regain any substantial territories in Italy . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 By 1518 , the peace that had prevailed in Europe after the Battle of Marignano was beginning to crumble . The major powers ( France , England , Spain , and the Holy Roman Empire ) were outwardly friendly , pledging by the Treaty of London to come to the aid of any of the signatories that was attacked and to combine against any nation that broke the peace . They were divided , however , on the question of the Imperial succession . The Holy Roman Emperor , Maximilian I , intending for a Habsburg to succeed him , began to campaign on behalf of Charles of Spain , while Francis put himself forward as an alternate candidate . At the same time , the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire were forced to deal with the rising influence of Martin Luther , who found support among some Imperial nobles , while Francis was faced with Cardinal Thomas Wolsey , who interposed himself into the quarrels of the continent in an attempt to increase both England 's influence and his own . 
 Maximilian 's death in 1519 brought the Imperial election to the forefront of European politics . Pope Leo X , threatened by the presence of Spanish troops a mere forty miles from the Vatican , supported the French candidacy . The prince @-@ electors themselves , with the exception of Frederick of Saxony , who refused to countenance the campaigning , promised their support to both candidates at once . Before his death , Maximilian had already promised sums of 500 @,@ 000 florins to the Electors in exchange for their votes , but Francis offered up to three million , and Charles retaliated by borrowing vast sums from the <unk> . The final outcome , however , was not determined by the exorbitant bribes , which included Leo promising to make the Archbishop of Mainz his permanent legate . The general outrage of the populace at the idea of a French Emperor gave the Electors pause , and when Charles put an army in the field near Frankfurt , where they were meeting , the Electors obligingly voted for him . He was crowned Holy Roman Emperor on 23 October 1520 , by which point he already controlled both the Spanish crown and the hereditary Burgundian lands in the Low Countries . 
 Cardinal Wolsey , hoping to increase Henry VIII 's influence on the continent , offered the services of England as a mediator for the various disputes between Francis and Charles . Henry and Francis staged an extravagant meeting at the Field of the Cloth of Gold . Immediately afterwards , Wolsey entertained Charles in Calais . Following the meetings , Wolsey , concerned mainly with improving his own stature in preparation for the next papal conclave , proceeded to stage a hollow arbitration conference at Calais , which lasted until April 1522 to no practical effect . 
 In December , the French began to plan for war . Francis did not wish to openly attack Charles because Henry had announced his intention to intervene against the first party to break the tenuous peace . Instead , he turned to more covert support for incursions into German and Spanish territory . One attack would be made on the Meuse River , under the leadership of Robert de la Marck . Simultaneously , a French @-@ Navarrese army would advance through Navarre after reconquering St @-@ Jean @-@ Pied @-@ de @-@ Port . The expedition was nominally led by the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Navarrese king Henry d 'Albret , whose kingdom had been invaded by Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1512 , but the army was effectively commanded by André de Foix and funded and equipped by the French . The French designs quickly proved flawed as the intervention of Henry of Nassau drove back the Meuse offensive ; and although de Foix was initially successful in seizing Pamplona , he was driven from Navarre after being defeated at the Battle of <unk> on 30 June 1521 . 
 Charles was meanwhile preoccupied with the issue of Martin Luther , whom he confronted at the Diet of Worms in March 1521 . The Emperor viewed Catholicism as a natural way of binding the diverse principalities of the Holy Roman Empire to him . Since Pope Leo X , for his part , was unwilling to tolerate such open defiance of his own authority , he and the Emperor were forced to support one another against Luther , who was now backed by Frederick of Saxony and Franz von Sickingen . On 25 May 1521 , Charles and Cardinal Girolamo Aleandro , the Papal nuncio , proclaimed the Edict of Worms against Luther . Simultaneously , the Emperor promised the Pope the restoration of Parma and Piacenza to the Medici and of Milan to the Sforza . Leo , needing the Imperial mandate for his campaign against what he viewed as a dangerous heresy , promised to assist in expelling the French from Lombardy , leaving Francis with only the Republic of Venice for an ally . 
 = = Initial moves = = 
 In June , Imperial armies under Henry of Nassau invaded the north of France , razing the cities of Ardres and <unk> and besieging Tournai . They were delayed by the dogged resistance of the French , led by Pierre Terrail , Seigneur de Bayard and Anne de Montmorency , during the Siege of <unk> , which gave Francis time to gather an army to confront the attack . On 22 October 1521 , Francis encountered the main Imperial army , which was commanded by Charles V himself , near Valenciennes . Despite the urging of Charles de Bourbon , Francis hesitated to attack , which allowed Charles time to retreat . When the French were finally ready to advance , the start of heavy rains prevented an effective pursuit and the Imperial forces were able to escape without a battle . Shortly afterwards , French @-@ Navarrese troops under Bonnivet and Claude of Lorraine seized the key city of Fuenterrabia , at the mouth of the Bidasoa River on the Franco @-@ Spanish border , following a protracted series of maneuvers , providing the French with an advantageous foothold in northern Spain that would remain in their hands for the next two years . 
 By November , the French situation had deteriorated considerably . Charles , Henry VIII , and the Pope signed an alliance against Francis on 28 November . Odet de Foix , Vicomte de Lautrec , the French governor of Milan , was tasked with resisting the Imperial and Papal forces ; he was outmatched by Prospero Colonna , however , and by late November had been forced out of Milan and had retreated to a ring of towns around the Adda River . There , Lautrec was reinforced by the arrival of fresh Swiss mercenaries ; but , having no money available to pay them , he gave in to their demands to engage the Imperial forces immediately . On 27 April 1522 , he attacked Colonna 's combined Imperial and Papal army near Milan at the Battle of Bicocca . Lautrec had planned to use his superiority in artillery to his advantage , but the Swiss , impatient to engage the enemy , masked his guns and charged against the entrenched Spanish arquebusiers . In the resulting melee , the Swiss were badly mauled by the Spanish under Fernando d 'Avalos , Marquess of Pescara , and by a force of landsknechts commanded by Georg Frundsberg . Their morale broken , the Swiss returned to their cantons ; Lautrec , left with too few troops to continue the campaign , abandoned Lombardy entirely . Colonna and d 'Avalos , left unopposed , proceeded to besiege Genoa , capturing the city on 30 May . 
 = = France at bay = = 
 Lautrec 's defeat brought England openly into the conflict . In late May 1522 , the English ambassador presented Francis with an ultimatum enumerating accusations against France , notably that of supporting the Duke of Albany in Scotland , all of which were denied by the king . Henry VIII and Charles signed the Treaty of Windsor on 16 June 1522 . The treaty outlined a joint English @-@ Imperial attack against France , with each party providing at least 40 @,@ 000 men . Charles agreed to compensate England for the pensions that would be lost because of conflict with France and to pay the past debts that would be forfeit ; to seal the alliance , he also agreed to marry Henry 's only daughter , Mary . In July , the English attacked Brittany and Picardy from Calais . Francis was unable to raise funds to sustain significant resistance , and the English army burned and looted the countryside . 
 Francis tried a variety of methods to raise money , but concentrated on a lawsuit against Charles III , Duke of Bourbon . The Duke of Bourbon had received the majority of his holdings through his marriage to Suzanne , Duchess of Bourbon , who had died shortly before the start of the war . Louise of Savoy , Suzanne 's sister and the king 's mother , insisted that the territories in question should pass to her because of her closer kinship to the deceased . Francis was confident that seizing the disputed lands would improve his own financial position sufficiently to continue the war and began to confiscate portions of them in Louise 's name . Bourbon , angered by this treatment and increasingly isolated at court , began to make overtures to Charles V to betray the French king . 
 By 1523 , the French situation had entirely collapsed . The death of Doge Antonio Grimani brought Andrea Gritti , a veteran of the War of the League of Cambrai , to power in Venice . He quickly began negotiations with the Emperor and on 29 July concluded the Treaty of Worms , which removed the Republic from the war . Bourbon continued his scheming with Charles , offering to begin a rebellion against Francis in exchange for money and German troops . When Francis , who was aware of the plot , summoned him to Lyon in October , he feigned illness and fled to the Imperial city of Besançon . Enraged , Francis ordered the execution of as many of Bourbon 's associates as he could capture , but the Duke himself , having rejected a final offer of reconciliation , openly entered the Emperor 's service . 
 Charles then invaded southern France over the Pyrenees . Lautrec successfully defended Bayonne against the Spanish , but Charles was able to recapture Fuenterrabia in February 1524 . On 18 September 1523 , meanwhile , a massive English army under the Duke of Suffolk advanced into French territory from Calais in conjunction with a Flemish @-@ Imperial force . The French , stretched thin by the Imperial attack , were unable to resist , and Suffolk soon advanced past the Somme , devastating the countryside in his wake and stopping only fifty miles from Paris . When Charles failed to support the English offensive , however , Suffolk — unwilling to risk an attack on the French capital — turned away from Paris on 30 October , returning to Calais by mid @-@ December . 
 Francis now turned his attention to Lombardy . In October 1523 , a French army of 18 @,@ 000 under Bonnivet advanced through the Piedmont to Novara , where it was joined by a similarly sized force of Swiss mercenaries . Prospero Colonna , who had only 9 @,@ 000 men to oppose the French advance , retreated to Milan . Bonnivet , however , overestimated the size of the Imperial army and moved into winter quarters rather than attacking the city ; and the Imperial commanders were able to summon 15 @,@ 000 landsknechts and a large force under Bourbon 's command by 28 December , when Charles de Lannoy replaced the dying Colonna . Many of the Swiss now abandoned the French army , and Bonnivet began his withdrawal . The French defeat at the Battle of the <unk> , where Bayard was killed while commanding the French rearguard , again demonstrated the power of massed arquebusiers against more traditional troops ; the French army then retreated over the Alps in disarray . 
 D 'Avalos and Bourbon crossed the Alps with nearly 11 @,@ 000 men and invaded Provence in early July 1524 . Sweeping through most of the smaller towns unopposed , Bourbon entered the provincial capital of Aix @-@ en @-@ Provence on 9 August 1524 , taking the title of Count of Provence and pledging his allegiance to Henry VIII in return for the latter 's support against Francis . By mid @-@ August , Bourbon and d 'Avalos had besieged Marseille , the only stronghold in Provence that remained in French hands . Their assaults on the city failed , however , and when the French army commanded by Francis himself arrived at Avignon at the end of September 1524 , they were forced to retreat back to Italy . 
 = = Pavia = = 
 In mid @-@ October 1524 , Francis himself crossed the Alps and advanced on Milan at the head of an army numbering more than 40 @,@ 000 . Bourbon and d 'Avalos , their troops not yet recovered from the campaign in Provence , were in no position to offer serious resistance . The French army moved in several columns , brushing aside Imperial attempts to hold its advance , but failed to bring the main body of Imperial troops to battle . Nevertheless , Charles de Lannoy , who had concentrated some 16 @,@ 000 men to resist the 33 @,@ 000 French troops closing on Milan , decided that the city could not be defended and withdrew to Lodi on 26 October . Having entered Milan and installed Louis II de la Trémoille as the governor , Francis ( at the urging of Bonnivet and against the advice of his other senior commanders , who favored a more vigorous pursuit of the retreating Lannoy ) advanced on Pavia , where Antonio de Leyva remained with a sizable Imperial garrison . 
 The main mass of French troops arrived at Pavia in the last days of October 1524 . By 2 November , Montmorency had crossed the Ticino River and invested the city from the south , completing its encirclement . Inside were about 9 @,@ 000 men , mainly mercenaries whom Antonio de Leyva was able to pay only by melting the church plate . A period of skirmishing and artillery bombardments followed , and several breaches had been made in the walls by mid @-@ November . On 21 November , Francis attempted an assault on the city through two of the breaches , but was beaten back with heavy casualties ; hampered by rainy weather and a lack of gunpowder , the French decided to wait for the defenders to starve . 
 In early December , a Spanish force commanded by Hugo of Moncada landed near Genoa , intending to interfere in a conflict between pro @-@ Valois and pro @-@ Habsburg factions in the city . Francis dispatched a larger force under Michele Antonio I of Saluzzo to intercept them . Confronted by the more numerous French and left without naval support by the arrival of a pro @-@ Valois fleet commanded by Andrea Doria , the Spanish troops surrendered . Francis then signed a secret agreement with Pope Clement VII , who pledged not to assist Charles in exchange for Francis 's assistance with the conquest of Naples . Against the advice of his senior commanders , Francis detached a portion of his forces under the Duke of Albany and sent them south to aid the Pope . Lannoy attempted to intercept the expedition near <unk> , but suffered heavy casualties and was forced to return to Lodi by the intervention of the infamous Black Bands of Giovanni de ' Medici , which had just entered French service . Medici then returned to Pavia with a supply train of gunpowder and shot gathered by the Duke of Ferrara ; but the French position was simultaneously weakened by the departure of nearly 5 @,@ 000 Grisons Swiss mercenaries , who returned to their cantons in order to defend them against marauding landsknechts . 
 In January 1525 , Lannoy was reinforced by the arrival of Georg Frundsberg with 15 @,@ 000 fresh landsknechts and renewed the offensive . D 'Avalos captured the French outpost at San Angelo , cutting the lines of communication between Pavia and Milan , while a separate column of landsknechts advanced on <unk> and , despite being briefly pushed back by a raid led by Medici and Bonnivet , occupied the town . By 2 February , Lannoy was only a few miles from Pavia . Francis had encamped the majority of his forces in the great walled park of Mirabello outside the city walls , placing them between Leyva 's garrison and the approaching relief army . Skirmishing and sallies by the garrison continued through the month of February . Medici was seriously wounded and withdrew to Piacenza to recuperate , forcing Francis to recall much of the Milan garrison to offset the departure of the Black Band ; but the fighting had little overall effect . On 21 February , the Imperial commanders , running low on supplies and mistakenly believing that the French forces were more numerous than their own , decided to launch an attack on Mirabello Castle in order to save face and demoralize the French sufficiently to ensure a safe withdrawal . 
 In the early morning of 24 February 1525 , Imperial engineers opened breaches in the walls of Mirabello , allowing Lannoy 's forces to enter the park . At the same time , Leyva sortied from Pavia with what remained of the garrison . In the ensuing four @-@ hour battle , the French heavy cavalry , which had proven so effective against the Swiss at Marignano ten years prior , masked its own artillery by a rapid advance and was surrounded and cut apart by landsknechts and d 'Avalos 's massed Spanish arquebusiers . Meanwhile , a series of protracted infantry engagements resulted in the rout of the Swiss and French infantry . The French suffered massive casualties , losing the majority of their army . Bonnivet , Jacques de la Palice , La Trémoille , and Richard de la Pole were killed , while Anne de Montmorency , Robert de la Marck , and Francis himself were taken prisoner along with a host of lesser nobles . The night following the battle , Francis gave Lannoy a letter to be delivered to his mother in Paris , in which he related what had befallen him : " To inform you of how the rest of my ill @-@ fortune is proceeding , all is lost to me save honour and life , which is safe . " Soon afterwards , he finally learned that the Duke of Albany had lost the larger part of his army to attrition and desertion , and had returned to France without ever having reached Naples . The broken remnants of the French forces , aside from a small garrison left to hold the Castel <unk> in Milan , retreated across the Alps under the nominal command of Charles IV of Alençon , reaching Lyon by March 1525 .

 After Pavia , the fate of the French king , and of France herself , became the subject of furious diplomatic manoeuvring . Charles V , lacking funds to pay for the war , decided to forgo the marriage into the House of Tudor which he had promised Henry VIII and sought instead to marry Isabella of Portugal , who would bring with her a more substantial dowry . Bourbon , meanwhile , plotted with Henry to invade and partition France , and at the same time encouraged d 'Avalos to seize Naples and declare himself King of Italy . 
 Louise of Savoy , who had remained as regent in France during her son 's absence , attempted to gather troops and funds to defend against an expected invasion of Artois by English troops . She also sent a first French mission to Suleiman the Magnificent requesting assistance , but the mission was lost on its way in Bosnia . In December 1525 a second mission was sent , led by John Frangipani , which managed to reach Constantinople , the Ottoman capital , with secret letters asking for the deliverance of king Francis I and an attack on the Habsburg . Frangipani returned with an answer from Suleiman , on 6 February 1526 , initiating the first steps of a Franco @-@ Ottoman alliance . Suleiman eventually wrote an ultimatum to Charles , asking for the immediate release of Francis — and demanding a yearly tax from the Holy Roman Empire ; when this was not forthcoming , the Ottomans launched an invasion of Hungary in the summer of 1526 , aiming to reach Vienna . 
 Francis , convinced that he would regain his freedom if he could obtain a personal audience with Charles , pressed d 'Avalos and Lannoy , who had intended to transport the king to the Castel Nuovo in Naples , to send him to Spain instead . Concerned by Bourbon 's scheming , they agreed and Francis arrived in Barcelona on 12 June . 
 Francis was initially held in a villa in <unk> , near Valencia , but Charles , urged to negotiate a settlement by Montmorency and Lannoy , who suggested that the Italians would soon prove unfaithful to their Imperial alliance , ordered the king brought to Madrid and imprisoned in the citadel there . However , Charles adamantly refused to receive Francis personally until the latter had accepted an agreement . Meanwhile , Henry II of Navarre , who had fought alongside Francis at Pavia and who had been imprisoned in Madrid as well , escaped . The struggle for Navarre continued , with Charles occupying the southern fringes of Lower Navarre and Henry remaining at large . 
 Charles demanded not only the surrender of Lombardy , but also of Burgundy and Provence , forcing Francis to argue that French law prevented him from surrendering any lands possessed by the crown without the approval of Parlement , which would not be forthcoming . 
 In September , Francis fell gravely ill , and his sister , Marguerite de Navarre , rode from Paris to join him in Spain . The Imperial doctors examining the king believed that his illness was caused by his sorrow at not being received by the Emperor , and urged Charles to visit him . Charles , against the advice of his Grand Chancellor , <unk> Gattinara , who argued that seeing Francis on his deathbed was an action motivated by mercenary concerns rather than by compassion , and was thus unworthy of the Emperor , consented ; and Francis soon made a complete recovery . An attempt to escape , however , proved fruitless , and succeeded only in getting Marguerite sent back to France . 
 By the beginning of 1526 , Charles was faced with demands from Venice and the Pope to restore Francesco II Sforza to the throne of the Duchy of Milan , and had become anxious to achieve a settlement with the French before another war began . Francis , having argued to retain Burgundy without result , was prepared to surrender it to achieve his own release . On 14 January 1526 , Charles and Francis agreed to the Treaty of Madrid , by which the French king renounced all his claims in Italy , Flanders , and Artois , surrendered Burgundy to Charles , agreed to send two of his sons to be hostages at the Spanish court , and promised to marry Charles ' sister Eleanor and to restore to Bourbon the territories that had been seized from him . Francis , who held the title of " Most Christian King " , also agreed to persuade Henry to relinquish the throne of Navarre in favor of Charles " in order to uproot the errors of the Lutheran sect and the rest of condemned sects " . 
 Francis was released on 6 March and , escorted by Lannoy , journeyed north to Fuenterrabia . On 18 March , he crossed the Bidasoa north into France , while at the same time the Dauphin and his brother , who had been brought to Bayonne by Louise and Lautrec , crossed into Spain and into captivity . By this time , Francis had attained peace with England by the Treaty of Hampton Court ; drafted by Thomas Wolsey and the French ambassador at the Hampton Court Palace , the treaty was signed in 1526 , and was ratified by a French delegation in April 1527 at Greenwich . 
 Francis , however , had no intentions of complying with the remaining provisions of the Treaty of Madrid . On 22 March , with the Pope 's blessing , he proclaimed that he would not be bound by the Treaty of Madrid because it had been signed under duress . Clement VII , who had meanwhile become convinced that the Emperor 's growing power was a threat to his own position in Italy , sent envoys to Francis and Henry VIII suggesting an alliance against Charles . Henry , having received nothing from the Treaty of Madrid , was receptive to the offers . In May , Francis and the Pope launched the War of the League of Cognac in an attempt to reclaim the territory the French had lost ; Henry , rebuffed in his attempt to have the alliance signed in England , would not join until 1527 . The war would prove unsuccessful ; but Francis and his successor , Henry II , would continue to assert their claims to Milan through the remainder of the Italian Wars , only relinquishing them after the Peace of Cateau @-@ Cambrésis in 1559 . 
 = Hurricane Gordon ( 2000 ) = 
 Hurricane Gordon caused minor damage in the Eastern United States . The seventh named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season , Gordon developed in the extreme western Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave on September 14 . Shortly thereafter , the depression moved inland over the Yucatán Peninsula and later emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on September 15 . The depression began to quickly organize , and by early on September 16 , it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gordon . After becoming a tropical storm , Gordon continued to intensify and was reclassified as a hurricane about 24 hours later ; eventually , the storm peaked as an 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) Category 1 hurricane . However , southwesterly upper @-@ level winds caused Gordon to weaken as it approached land , and it was downgraded to a tropical storm by late on September 17 . At 0300 UTC on September 18 , Gordon made landfall near Cedar Key , Florida as a strong tropical storm . After moving inland , Gordon rapidly weakened and had deteriorated to tropical depression status by nine hours later . Later that day , Gordon merged with a frontal boundary while centered over Georgia . 
 Prior to becoming a tropical cyclone , the precursor tropical wave caused severe flooding in Guatemala , killing 23 people . While crossing the Yucatán Peninsula , the storm dropped heavy rainfall , with a few areas experiencing more than 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of precipitation . Similarly , portions of western Cuba reported rainfall totals reaching 10 inches ( 250 mm ) . Gordon brought moderate storm surge to the west coast of Florida ; one person drowned due to rough seas . Numerous trees and power lines sustained damage , which left 120 @,@ 000 people without electricity . In the Tampa Bay area and Cedar Key , minor roof damage to houses and street flooding occurred . In addition , two tornadoes caused some damage in Cape Coral and Ponce Inlet . Elsewhere , affects were minimal , though two indirect fatalities occurred in North Carolina , and minor flooding was reported in South Carolina , Virginia , West Virginia , Maryland , Delaware , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , and New York . Overall , Gordon caused $ 10 @.@ 8 million ( 2000 USD ) in damage and 26 fatalities .

 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 4 and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean without strengthening . On September 9 and 10 , the tropical wave moved though the Lesser Antilles bringing local heavy rainfall and wind gusts reaching 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . The wave then moved west @-@ northwest and developed a well @-@ defined center on September 12 in the central Caribbean Sea . Satellite photos on September 13 indicated that the convective pattern in the system was disorganized . However , later that day , a broad low pressure area had developed along axis of the wave , based on surface observations about 118 mi ( 190 km ) southeast of Cozumel , Mexico . Early on September 14 , it was estimated from satellite imagery that the low pressure system was near tropical depression strength , even though the convection was still disorganized . 
 The system was classified as Tropical Depression Eleven at 1200 UTC on September 14 , based on reports from reconnaissance aircraft . Later that day , the developing depression moved inland over the Yucatán Peninsula . The depression moved slowly to the northwest without emerging over water , therefore , the depression did not gain intensity . At this time , the predicted track for the system was highly uncertain due to different computer models forecasting different tracks . The official forecast predicted a northwestward movement into the western Gulf of Mexico , but some models predicted the low to move towards northwestern Florida , while another model predicted the low to move southwards into the Bay of Campeche . Late on September 15 , the depression moved off the north coast of the Yucatán Peninsula and into the Gulf of Mexico , where it showed signs of better organization . The future track was still very uncertain , though a few computer models forecasted for the depression to move northeastwards towards Florida , resulting in an eastward shift on official forecast . Early on September 16 , data from Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicated that the storm had strengthened to about 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) at the surface , and the barometric pressure had fallen to 1 @,@ 003 mbar ( 29 @.@ 6 inHg ) . Therefore , it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gordon at 0000 UTC . 
 Upon being a tropical storm on September 16 , Gordon was moving northeastward towards the Big Bend of Florida , continuing to slowly intensify . The official forecast track was shifted further east , forecasting Gordon to track to the northeast . Early on September 17 , a ship reported winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) , indicating that Gordon had attained hurricane strength . Gordon reached a peak intensity of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) , six hours later while located about 190 mi ( 310 km ) southwest of Tampa , Florida . Later that day , Gordon began to weaken due to entrainment from the south and increasing vertical wind shear . Gordon was downgraded to a tropical storm as it neared the Florida coast . The storm made landfall just northwest of Cedar Key , Florida , at 0300 UTC on September 18 with winds of 60 mph ( 95 mph ) . After moving inland , interaction with the land and cool , dry air further weakened the storm . Gordon weakened to a tropical depression nine hours after landfall , and six hours later , it had merged with a frontal system over southeastern Georgia . The storm also transitioned into an extratropical cyclone , as it moved to the northeast . On September 21 , the system merged with a large extratropical system over eastern Canada .

 Residents in Florida loaded up supplies on September 16 when the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch along Florida 's west coast from Bonita Beach to the Suwanee River . The hurricane watch extended northward and westward later in the day to Apalachicola . Hurricane warnings were initiated on September 17 for areas along the Florida coast from Anna Maria Island to Ochlockonee River . Tropical storm warnings were issued south of Anna Maria Island to Bonita Beach and west of Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass . Tropical storm warnings were also issued along the east coast of the United States from Titusville in Florida to Little River Inlet in South Carolina . The Florida Division of Emergency Management in Tallahassee issued a mandatory evacuation in Hernando County , while voluntary evacuations were called for some of the coastal areas along Florida 's west coast . Anticipating that Gordon will make landfall and move inland , two tornado watches were in effect from Sarasota to Naples , and tornado warnings were issued from Orlando to Vero Beach . Flash flood warnings were also in effect in parts of Florida . 
 On September 17 , Governor of Florida Jeb Bush activated emergency response teams . In various areas of Florida , spokesmen for the Emergency Operations Center advised residents to prepare for the storm and monitor the track of the approaching hurricane . At Cape Canaveral , National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) also took precautions against the hurricane , as the storm could force NASA to move Space Shuttle Discovery off its launch pad at the seaside and into the hangar . Many evacuations took place once Gordon crossed the Florida coast . The Emergency Operations Center in Florida said authorities had arranged mandatory evacuations for coastal regions in the Citrus , Franklin , Hernando , Levy and Taylor counties , while also recommending voluntary evacuations for numerous other counties . The Red Cross reported that the storm forced 500 people to seek refuge in shelters . Also , many flights were canceled at the Tampa International Airport . About 200 National Guardsmen were called to help clean up the damage in flooded areas . Officials forced schools in six counties – Gilchrist , Columbia , Citrus , Taylor , Lafayette and Suwannee to close down for one day .

 = Keith Miller = 
 Keith Ross Miller , AM MBE ( 28 November 1919 – 11 October 2004 ) was an Australian test cricketer and a Royal Australian Air Force pilot during World War II . Miller is widely regarded as Australia 's greatest ever all @-@ rounder . Because of his ability , irreverent manner and good looks he was a crowd favourite . English journalist Ian Wooldridge called Miller " the golden boy " of cricket , leading to his being nicknamed " Nugget " . He " was more than a cricketer ... he embodied the idea that there was more to life than cricket " . 
 A member of the record @-@ breaking Invincibles , at the time of his retirement from Test cricket in 1956 , Miller had the best statistics of any all @-@ rounder in cricket history . He often batted high in the order , sometimes as high as number three . He was a powerful striker of the ball , and one straight six that he hit at the Sydney Cricket Ground was still rising when it hit the upper deck of the grandstand . Miller was famous for varying his bowling to <unk> batsmen : he made sparing use of slower deliveries and would often adjust his run @-@ up , surprisingly bowling his fastest deliveries from a short run . He was also a fine fielder and an especially acrobatic catcher in the slips . 
 Away from cricket , Miller was also a successful Australian rules footballer . He played for St Kilda and was selected to represent the Victorian state team . He played 50 games for St Kilda , for whom he kicked eight goals in one game against North Melbourne , during 1941 . 
 Miller 's personality — love of the contest , rather than victory , and his larger @-@ than @-@ life rebelliousness and carousing — helped both shape and limit his cricketing career , as he espoused the opposite of the more puritanical values of Donald Bradman , his captain and later national selector . Neville Cardus referred to Miller as " the Australian in excelsis " ; Daily Mail sportswriter Ian Wooldridge 's response was " By God he was right " . This status was reflected when Miller was made one of the ten inaugural members of the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Born in the western Melbourne suburb of Sunshine , Miller was the youngest of Leslie and Edith Miller 's four children . He was named after the Australian pioneer aviator brothers Keith and Ross Smith , who were half @-@ way through their historic flight from England to Australia at the time Miller was born . The three Miller boys played Australian rules football in winter and cricket in summer . Their father had been a successful local cricketer and taught the boys to play with an orthodox and classical technique , relying on a solid defence and concentration in the mould of Bill Ponsford . At the age of seven , Miller 's family moved to Elsternwick , in Melbourne 's south east . As a child , Miller was small for his age , which forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power , something that held him in good stead for the future . 
 At the age of 12 , he was selected for an under @-@ 15 Victorian schoolboys cricket team . At the time , he stood only 150 centimetres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) tall and wielded a sawn @-@ off bat . He lacked power , but impressed with his footwork and style . However , Miller reasoned that , as he appeared destined to be short , a career as a jockey was more likely than one as a cricketer or footballer . 
 Miller attended the selective Melbourne High School , where Australian test captain Bill Woodfull was his mathematics teacher . Miller was a mediocre student , which disappointed Woodfull ; however , Woodfull quickly noticed Miller 's cricket skills . Aged 14 , Miller was selected for the school 's first XI , scoring 44 . His control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him The <unk> — Woodfull 's own nickname . In 1934 , Miller failed all of his subjects , scoring zero in his final exam for Woodfull 's geometry class , and was forced to repeat the year . 
 Keith Truscott , Miller 's school cricket captain took him to a trial with local club side St Kilda at the start of the 1934 – 35 season , but Miller could not find a place in any of its five teams . Joining the local sub @-@ district cricket club Elsternwick instead , he did not get to bat or bowl in his first match , and was dropped to the second XI for his poor fielding . Nevertheless , his team @-@ mate , former Victoria state player Hughie Carroll , spotted Miller 's talent and lured him to the rival South Melbourne club . Miller began playing for South Melbourne the following season . It was at South Melbourne that Miller met Ian Johnson and Lindsay Hassett , his future Australia captains . Miller scored 12 not out on debut , but observers felt he would succeed with a stronger physique ; Woodfull wrote in the 1936 school magazine , " Miller has Test possibilities " . 
 In March 1936 , Miller played for South Melbourne against Carlton , captained by Woodfull . Miller came to the crease at 6 / 32 . He guided his team to 141 , putting on a stand of 65 with the last man and finishing with 61 . The crowd gave Miller a standing ovation , and newspapers him compared him to Ponsford and Alan Kippax . The Carlton team presented him with a silver eggcup , " for sterling performance " , which Woodfull presented to Miller during an algebra class . 
 = = <unk> in Sheffield Shield and Victorian Football League = = 
 During 1936 , Miller underwent a sudden growth spurt , of 28 centimetres ( 11 @.@ 0 in ) in the year , reaching 185 centimetres ( 6 @.@ 1 ft ) in height . This thwarted his career as a jockey . With his increased height and weight , he began to play football with more physical aggression . At the end of 1936 , he completed year 10 and quit high school , taking a position as a clerk . 
 For the 1937 – 38 cricket season , Miller transferred to the VCA Colts , where he won the team 's batting trophy for having the best average . At this stage , his method of playing was slow and steady accumulation of runs . Late in the summer , he made his first @-@ class debut for Victoria and hit 181 against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . In 1938 – 39 , he rejoined South Melbourne and also played four further matches for Victoria , scoring 125 runs at an average of 25 @.@ 00 . However , he was yet to play in the Sheffield Shield competition , having appeared only in one @-@ off matches . 
 During this period , Miller achieved more success as a footballer , following his brothers in joining the Brighton Football Club in the Victorian Football Association ( VFA ) in 1937 . A defender , Miller initially played on the half @-@ back flank before moving to full back during his third season , in 1939 . At this stage , he lacked the strength to hip and shoulder his opponents and relied on his running ability and accurate kicking . 
 Miller finally made his breakthrough in cricket in 1939 – 40 , when he was selected to make his Sheffield Shield debut , against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval . He managed just four and seven , batting at number five in the order . When Victoria fielded , Miller ran out his future Invincibles captain Don Bradman . One of Miller 's teammates was Percy Beames , who was also his manager at Vacuum Oil . Miller scored 41 and 47 not out in his second match to hold his place . However , against New South Wales , Miller made a pair of 14s , having difficulties against leg spin . In the return match against South Australia , Miller took the initiative against leg @-@ spinner Clarrie Grimmett , aggressively advancing down the pitch and driving . Miller reached 108 , his first century in Shield competition . Apart from the century , Miller had a moderate season , ending with 298 runs at 29 @.@ 80 . 
 In the Australian winter of 1940 , Miller started his fourth season in the VFA . In a match against Coburg , he was assigned to nullify the greatest forward of the era , Bob Pratt . Miller restricted Pratt to just one goal for the match and was named best on ground . Scouts from top @-@ tier Victorian Football League ( VFL ) club St Kilda signed Miller on the spot . In a match for St Kilda against Carlton , Miller was king hit by his opponent Ron Cooper at the start of the match . When the teams next met , Miller shoulder bumped Cooper in the first minute , forcing him to leave the field . St Kilda finished second @-@ last that season . 
 = = War service = = 
 Miller 's sporting career was interrupted by World War II . On 20 August 1940 , he joined the Militia ( army reserve ) , and was assigned to the 4th Reserve Motor Transport Company . In late September , Miller began his training . A non @-@ conformist , he had the first of many clashes with authority in November , when he was fined for " using insulting language to a superior officer " . Miller soon lived up to the traditional nickname of Dusty , for anyone called Miller , with his tendency to be involved in fist fights and his rambunctious persona . 
 During the summer of 1940 – 41 , Miller was granted leave so that he could play interstate cricket . In a war @-@ shortened season , Miller scored 140 runs at 28 @.@ 00 and took his maiden first @-@ class wicket . The 1941 VFL season also went ahead . Miller played in defence and attack , depending on match conditions . In 16 games , he kicked 28 goals , including eight in one match . He again showed his disrespect for authority and reputation , striking his boss Beames — who played for Melbourne — with a raised elbow at the start of a match . Miller came second in St Kilda 's best and fairest for the season . 
 Miller 's season ended early when he was recalled to duty . However , he had continued disciplinary problems , and left the Militia on 8 November 1941 . Miller and a friend then attempted to join the Royal Australian Navy . When the navy rejected his friend , Miller tore up his own paperwork , left the recruiting office , and walked around the corner to the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) recruiting office , where he enlisted . 
 Less than two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 , Miller was called to active service . He trained at No. 4 Initial Training School , Victor Harbor in South Australia , and gained his wings in late 1942 . He played only one match during the 1942 football season , while posted in South Australia . In December , he was promoted to the rank of flight sergeant and , a month later , he sailed to Europe . The journey included a stopover at a training camp in Boston in the United States , where Miller met his future wife Peg Wagner . In March , he was deployed to Bournemouth , in England , where he continued his training . 
 Miller was invited to join a RAAF team in London . The team was officially formed in preparation for the 1943 season and Miller 's selection let to the first of many brushes with death : in April , while away with the team , some of his comrades were killed in a German air strike . Miller played his first match at Lord 's against Warner 's XI , a team that featured past , current and future England players , including Bob Wyatt , Gubby Allen , Trevor Bailey and Alec Bedser . Miller top @-@ scored in the first innings with 45 and added 21 not out , with two sixes , in the second innings . The RAAF played eight matches that season and Miller 's top score was 141 against Public School Wanderers . He went on to play for Dominions against Warner 's XI in August , scoring 32 and two . The match marked the first meeting between Miller and his good friend , England batsman Denis Compton and his bowling began to attract media attention . In the final match of the season at Lord 's between the RAAF and the Royal Air Force , Miller took 3 / 23 and scored 91 . The success of RAAF and Dominions that season , especially the attractive batting by Miller and Keith Carmody , prompted Warner to begin planning for a " Test " series between the respective armed services of England and Australia . 
 By late 1943 , Miller was based in Gloucestershire . One night , he threatened to punch his commanding officer , resulting in his being sentenced for insubordination to a three @-@ week disciplinary course with hard labour . In mid @-@ November , he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle @-@ upon @-@ Tyne where he trained in the used of radar . During his stay there , Miller sustained a back injury during a wrestling match : the injury was to cause him recurring and enduring problems , particularly diminishing his ability to bowl . 
 In 1944 , Miller was again selected for the RAAF team . In a match against the British Civil Defence Services at Lord 's in July , Miller reached his century just as a V @-@ 1 flying bomb landed nearby . In a match against an England XI , Miller scored 85 in 100 minutes . He then took match figures of 6 / 28 against the West of England at Bristol . 
 After ten months of training , Miller was offered a commission as a pilot officer , and was posted to 12 Advanced Flying Unit in Grantham , Lincolnshire on 15 August 1944 , then moving on to Cranfield , Bedfordshire . On a trip back to Ouston to visit former comrades , a night of drunken revelry saw Miller charged with eight offences and facing possible dishonourable discharge . Luckily for Miller , his new Commanding Officer ( CO ) was his old CO from Ouston ; Miller escaped with a fine . 
 While training , Miller flew Beauforts , Beaufighters and Mosquitos . He had another near death experience : mechanical problems forced him to make an emergency landing of his Beaufighter . The plane was repaired for use by others , but , on its next flight , the pilot was killed when the problem recurred . On another occasion , Miller avoided colliding with a hangar by centimetres . He then escaped death by skipping a social appointment ; a V1 bomb hit the venue and killed many of the patrons . In October , he went <unk> to watch a concert and was summarily discharged , but the CO revoked his decision after Miller agreed to play for his cricket team . At the end of his officer training , Miller was sent aboard a Royal Navy destroyer as part of an exchange program between the forces . During a mission to Belgium , the vessel fought a German U @-@ boat , which was sunk . Upon his return to England , Miller was promoted to flying officer on 4 November 1944 . 
 In March 1945 , Miller was deployed to the RAF station at Great Massingham in Norfolk , East Anglia . He was assigned to 169 Squadron , flying Mosquito fighter @-@ bombers . Miller 's squadron took part in missions against targets on mainland Europe in April and May 1945 . They attacked V @-@ 1 and V @-@ 2 production and test launch sites on the island of Peenemünde in the North Sea . On 19 April , Miller took part in an attack on a German installation at Flensburg in Denmark . In May , his squadron was deployed in Operation Fire Bash , to attack Westerland Airfield on the island of Sylt . One of Miller 's bombs failed to release and the load dangled from a wing . Miller was obliged to land the plane with the bomb still attached ; fortunately for him , it failed to detonate . Miller 's next mission was delayed by poor weather , by which time Germany had surrendered . His commanding officer ordered him to fly air force personnel over Germany to view the results of Allied bombing . On one flight , Miller broke away from the flying formation and returned to base late because he wanted to fly over Bonn , the birthplace of Beethoven . 
 Miller 's wartime exploits were to give him a greater sense of perspective when he returned to the sports field . When asked many years later by Michael Parkinson , about pressure in cricket , Miller responded with the famous quote : " pressure is a Messerschmitt up your arse , playing cricket is not " . 
 = = = Victory Tests = = = 
 The end of the war prompted the belated start of the 1945 cricket season . Miller returned to Lord 's and scored 50 for the RAAF against a British Empire XI . Warner had organised a celebratory series of matches between England and Australian servicemen , known as the Victory Tests . However , Australian cricket administrators would not accredit the three @-@ day matches as Tests . England was close to full strength , so the Second Australian Imperial Force and the RAAF teams merged to form the Australian Services cricket team under the leadership of Warrant Officer Hassett . The First Victory Test was at Lord 's and was expected to usher in a new post @-@ war era , which cricket watchers hoped would be more attractive to watch . England batted first and Miller bowled his Great Massingham colleague Bill Edrich to end with 1 / 11 and precipitate an English collapse . Miller came to the crease at and helped Australia take the lead , before cutting loose , eventually finishing with 105 in 210 minutes . The Times opined that his innings was " as good a century as has been seen at Lord 's in many a long day " . Australia went on to win by six wickets . 
 Miller warmed up for the Second Victory Test by top @-@ scoring for the RAAF against Lancashire and the RAF . In the Test , played at Bramall Lane , Miller went wicketless and scored 17 in the first innings . In the second innings , Miller bowled a fierce spell , hitting Test world record holder Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook on the arm and head respectively , provoking an angry crowd reaction . At the time , Miller had a leisurely attitude towards bowling , so his success led to calls for him to start taking it seriously , instead of simply jogging in and releasing the ball . Despite this , Australia lost the match . 
 In the meantime , Miller earned the further ire of his CO by flying unauthorised leisure flights . Not wanting to fly tour flights over Germany , Miller lodged bogus reports saying that the Mosquitoes were malfunctioning , causing unnecessary maintenance work . Thus , the CO ordered Miller to take his plane instead , which caught fire . With one functional engine , Miller came back to the air base and <unk> . The plane broke apart and caught fire , but Miller escaped physical injury and was playing sport an hour later . 
 The next day , Miller headed to Lord 's to play for the RAAF against the South of England . Chasing 208 , Miller scored an unbeaten 78 in 95 minutes , but rain washed out the match . In the first innings of Third Victory Test at Lord 's , when finally called upon to bowl , Miller measured out a run @-@ up and removed John Dewes , Donald Carr and Hutton , all bowled . He ended with 3 / 44 . Miller was rewarded with the new ball in the second innings . He removed Dewes , Edrich and Dick Pollard to end with 3 / 42 . This left Australia a target of 225 . Miller saw Australia to the target , unbeaten on 71 . In the Fourth Test , again at Lord 's , Miller scored 118 in the first innings , before an unbeaten 25 in the second innings ensured a draw . The tremendous public reception of the Victory Tests resulted in a fifth match being added to the schedule . 
 In the meantime Japan had surrendered , and No. 169 Squadron was disbanded . Miller had spent around 550 hours in the air with the RAF , to which his RAAF unit had been seconded . He was awarded the 1939 – 45 Star , France and Germany Star , Defence Medal , War Medal 1939 – 1945 and Australia Service Medal 1939 – 45 . 
 In the Fifth Victory Test , under overcast conditions against a swinging and seaming ball , Miller struck 14 from his first over and finished 77 not out , in a display that featured strong cutting and driving . Australia could manage only 173 , and England were on top . Miller took one wicket with the ball but managed only four in the second innings as England won , to square the series 2 – 2 . Hassett wrote at the end of the series that " This is cricket as it should be ... let 's have no more talk of " war " in cricket " . Miller topped the batting averages for the series , with 443 runs at 63 @.@ 28 . His aggregate exceeded those of Hammond and Hutton , and he also took 10 wickets at 27 @.@ 70 . Of Miller 's batting , Hassett said that " as a strokeplayer he is second to none " , and his performance earned comparisons to Jack Gregory , who had a similar breakthrough after World War I. 
 The last big match of the season was a one @-@ off match at Lord 's between England and " Dominions " , a scratch team of players from the British Commonwealth . Miller managed 26 in the Dominions ' first innings of 307 , before cutting loose in the second innings . After settling in , he hit Eric Hollies for two sixes , including one that hit the top of the roof . The next day , he registered his century in 115 minutes , <unk> another five balls over the boundary in the morning session . In one 35 @-@ minute passage of play , he and Learie Constantine added 91 runs , before Miller departed for 185 , made in just 165 minutes . The Dominions went on to win by 45 runs in a match described by Wisden as " one of the finest ever seen " . Commenting on Miller ' innings , Robertson @-@ Glasgow said " From the moment he takes guard he plays each ball just that much below its supposed merits that scratches a bowler 's pride " . Miller had enjoyed his visit to the home of cricket . In eight innings at Lord 's for the season , he had scored 568 runs at 94 @.@ 68 , with three centuries . 
 The season ended with a few more matches against English counties . Miller struck aggressive half @-@ centuries in wins against Nottinghamshire and Leveson @-@ Gower 's XI . In first @-@ class matches , Miller had scored 725 runs at 72 @.@ 50 for the season , finishing second in both averages and aggregates . The success of the Australian Services prompted a fundraising tour of India and Ceylon on their return to Australia . 
 = = = Services tour of India = = = 
 Miller , the vice @-@ captain , almost missed the trip to India after turning up late for the voyage . On arrival in India , Miller scored 46 in a draw against North Zone . Miller then captained the Australians in a match against West Zone in Bombay , top @-@ scoring with 106 in a high @-@ scoring draw . In a match against India , Miller took two wickets . At this point , with most of the team suffering from dysentery and the leadership not permitting the team to travel by air , some of the RAAF personnel felt that Hassett should be removed from the captaincy , with Miller as one of the candidates to replace him . This would have increased his prospects of leading Australia . Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when a RAAF plane was acquired to transport the team . 
 The team played East Zone in Calcutta as the city was in the grip of deadly pro @-@ independence riots . Miller 's friend Denis Compton was batting for East Zone when rioters invaded the pitch . Their leader ran up to Compton and said : " Mr Compton , you very good player , but you must stop " . In later years , whenever Miller opposed Compton , he would quote this remark when Compton came to the crease . In 2005 , the ECB and Cricket Australia decided that the player adjudged the Player of the Series in the Ashes would be awarded the Compton – Miller Medal , recognising their friendship and rivalry . 
 In the second match against India , Services were 2 / 250 in response to India 's 386 when Miller came in and scored 82 , including four sixes in five balls . The match ended in a draw and Miller aggravating an injury . Miller took 3 / 19 against South Zone in Madras , the Australians ' only win in India . He failed with the bat in the third and final match against India , scoring two and seven , but he took 2 / 60 in the first innings as India took the series 1 – 0 . Overall , Miller had a disappointing series in the international matches , with 107 runs at 26 @.@ 25 and four wickets at 40 @.@ 50 . Australia 's final match was in Colombo against an All Ceylon team . Miller scored 132 as Australia won by an innings . 
 = = = Services in Australia = = = 
 Upon returning to Australia , Hassett 's men were assigned to play a further six first @-@ class matches against the state teams . The fixtures were meant to revive cricket and were also used as a lead @-@ up to the international tour to New Zealand in March 1946 . Miller started his campaign with 80 against Western Australia . He finally returned to Melbourne in January , before taking on Victoria . Miller top @-@ scored in both innings with 37 and 59 in an innings defeat . 
 Miller had another difficult time against New South Wales , as the state side made 7 / 551 and Miller went wicketless . When the servicemen batted , they faced an attack featuring leading leg spinner Bill O 'Reilly and paceman Ray Lindwall , the fastest in Australia . Miller was on 74 as Services limped to 9 / 171 . With only one partner left , Miller attacked , scoring 31 of the last 33 runs to end unbeaten on 105 , and earning plaudits among cricket pundits on Australian soil . Former leading Test batsman Alan Kippax opined that " Australia has unearthed a new champion " , while O 'Reilly said that Miller 's century was " one of the best hundreds ever got against me " . Miller compiled 46 in the second innings as the Servicemen fell to another innings defeat . Miller finished the season with 4 / 49 against Queensland and a pair of fifties against Tasmania .

 = = = Test debut = = = 
 At the end of the season , Miller was selected for the New Zealand tour , under the captaincy of Queensland 's Bill Brown . Miller started the tour well , top @-@ scoring with 139 against Auckland . Along with seven other debutants , Miller made his test debut in the match against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve in Wellington , a match that was retrospectively accorded Test status in 1948 . On a sticky wicket , New Zealand won the toss and batted . Miller was not required to bowl in the first innings as O 'Reilly and Ernie Toshack skittled the home side for just 42 . Australia made 8 / 199 with Miller scoring 30 . He was allowed to take the new ball in the second innings , taking 2 / 6 in six overs before a flare @-@ up of his back injury forced him to be removed from the attack . Australia bowled their hosts out for 54 , securing an innings victory . 
 Despite the scare over his back complaint , Miller returned from New Zealand to play in the 1946 season , which turned out to be his last season in the VFL ; St Kilda 's finished second @-@ last . Miller played with more aggression than during his pre @-@ war years and his high leaping marks were a noted feature of a season that saw him chosen to represent Victoria against South Australia . Miller thus became one of the few players to play at the highest levels of both cricket and Australian rules football . 
 Miller was discharged from the RAAF on 26 June 1946 , and returned to his job at Vacuum Oil . Miller resented the fact that many of his colleagues had avoided the hazards of war and moved steadily up the ladder and regarded his job as demeaning . Under such circumstances , Miller contemplated quitting Australian cricket and accepting a professional contract with Rawtenstall in the Lancashire League , valued at £ 1 @,@ 000 per year , for three seasons . With advertising and commercial commitments likely to triple this figure , playing in England would have been approximately ten times more lucrative than continuing in Australia . However , Miller was worried that his impulsive style would be curtailed by the pressures of professionalism . At that time , the Board of Control 's policy stipulated that any player that signed with a professional league in England could not represent Australia . Miller 's contract would see him in England until he was 30 , effectively ending his career for Australia . Furthermore , it would have prevented him from playing Australian football during the winter . Miller weighed it up and opted to sign the contract that tied him to Rawtenstall , with his duties to start with the onset of the English season in April 1947 . 
 In the meantime , Miller had the upcoming Test series against England in 1946 – 47 to look forward to . He therefore approached his employers for two months leave so that he could travel to the United States to marry Wagner , which would allow him time to return in preparation for the international series . Vacuum Oil refused , so , with the comfort of job security in England , Miller resigned . 
 Miller left Australia at the end of the football season in late August , amid press speculation that he might not return . He was reunited in Boston with Wagner after more than three years of separation and they married on 21 September 1946 . Miller and his new bride returned to Australia in November . In the meantime , his contract with Rawtenstall became public knowledge and he was threatened with his Test career being terminated if he began playing for the English team . 
 = = = First Ashes series = = = 
 Miller 's season started amid ongoing speculation about whether he would fulfil his contract with Rawtenstall . Miller remained silent . In a Shield match in front of Bradman at the Adelaide Oval , Miller struck form with 188 and 2 / 32 with the ball . Wisden said Miller 's innings was " one of the finest batting displays ever seen at Adelaide " . Bradman saw Miller as a top @-@ order batsman and as the new ball partner for Lindwall . Although Miller was a reluctant bowler , Bradman felt that he was crucial to his strategy of attacking England 's strong batting line @-@ up with express pace . 
 Miller made his Ashes debut in the First Test in Brisbane . Bradman opted for six front @-@ line bowlers , with Miller as high as number five in the batting order . Australia batted first , with Miller coming in at 3 / 322 . He played aggressively to reach his fifty in just 80 minutes , striking a six onto the roof of the members ' stand at long on , the biggest hit at the ground at the time , before being trapped leg before wicket by Doug Wright for 79 as Australia made 645 . Miller was given the new ball along with Lindwall and he took his first Ashes wicket , bowling Hutton as England closed at 1 / 21 . The following day , the pitch had turned into a sticky wicket following a heavy tropical storm . Miller bowled off breaks at medium pace and mixed in a large amount of bouncers . On the unpredictable surface , Edrich was struck around 40 times on the body . Miller cut through the English top order , removing Edrich , Washbrook , Compton and Jack Ikin on the fourth morning , finishing with 7 / 60 as England made 141 and were forced to follow on . Miller took two wickets , including the dismissal of Hutton with first ball of the second innings as England fell to defeat by an innings and 334 runs and Miller had match figures of 9 / 77 . 
 During that first Test , an incident occurred , coloured by Miller 's wartime service , that soured his relationship with Bradman and his feelings towards Test cricket . Michael Parkinson described it as follows : 
 Keith Miller was deeply affected by the Second World War . It changed him ... In the first post @-@ war Ashes Test ... England were caught on a sticky ... [ and ] Bill Edrich came in . He 'd had a serious war and he survived and Miller thought , ' He 's my old Services mate . The last thing he wants after five years ' war is to be flattened by a cricket ball , so I eased up . Bradman came up to me and said , ' Don 't slow down , Keith . Bowl quicker . ' That remark put me off Test cricket . Never felt the same way about it after that.' 
 In the Second Test in Sydney . Miller had a quiet match , scoring 40 and taking one wicket on a spin @-@ friendly pitch as Australia secured another innings victory , but showed he was in prime batting form when he returned to the Sheffield Shield . Playing against New South Wales , he hammered three sixes in one over and made 153 of a 271 @-@ run partnership with Merv Harvey in just over three hours , setting up an innings victory . Bill Ponsford said that it was the hardest hitting he had ever seen . The Third Test was Miller 's first in his home town . He had a mediocre game in a drawn match , scoring 33 and 34 , and taking two wickets . 
 Off the pitch , Miller privately decided that he would not honour his Rawtenstall contract . He secretly accepted an offer to relocate to Sydney to work as a liquor salesman and play cricket . Back in a good frame of mind for the Fourth Test in Adelaide , Miller took one wicket in each innings , but he shone with the bat . After England had made 460 , Miller came in at 3 / 207 , and was 23 not out by the close of the second day . He hit the first ball of the next day for six , and accumulated 67 runs in the opening 71 minutes , to reach his maiden Test century . The Englishmen utilised leg theory to prevent easy scoring , but as the tail began to be dismissed , Miller accelerated , launching drives into the crowd , despite the presence of four men on the fence . Miller ended unbeaten on 141 but the match petered out into a high @-@ scoring draw . Before the last Test , Miller played for Victoria against England , taking 4 / 65 . 
 The Fifth <unk> saw Miller take a wicket in each innings . Australia were left a target of 214 runs on a wearing wicket . Wright beat Miller with three consecutive leg breaks , but Miller survived and struck consecutive boundaries on the way to reaching the target . Australia had taken the series 3 – 0 ; Miller scored 384 runs at 76 @.@ 80 and took 16 wickets at 20 @.@ 88 , which placed him second in both the batting and bowling averages , to Bradman and Lindwall respectively . Nevertheless , Miller had become disillusioned with Bradman 's ruthless mentality . Miller was impulsive and cared little for records or ruthlessly dominating his opponents , preferring to play in a flamboyant manner in close contests . 
 For the 1947 – 48 Australian season , Miller transferred to New South Wales ( NSW ) , for whom he played the remainder of his Sheffield Shield career . He also represented the New South Wales interstate football team at the 1947 Hobart Carnival , as vice captain . This made him one of the few players to play both football and cricket for two states . 
 Miller had a light workload in the 1947 – 48 home Test series against India , who were on their first tour to Australia . India were well beaten , losing 4 – 0 , three of the four defeats by an innings . Miller was required to bat just once in each Test , accumulating 185 runs at 37 @.@ 00 , including two half @-@ centuries , while the batsmen ahead of him plundered the bowling . His bowling duties were also light ; his 72 overs yielded nine wickets at 24 @.@ 78 . In both his fifties , Miller featured in century partnerships with his partners , respectively Bradman and Hassett in the First and Fourth test respectively . His 58 in the First Test at Brisbane featured many big hits . 
 = = = Invincibles tour = = = 
 Donald Bradman 's 1948 touring party to England has become known to cricket history as The Invincibles , remaining undefeated in its 31 matches . Miller started the tour strongly , scoring a hard @-@ hitting 50 not out against Worcestershire , and an unbeaten 202 against Leicestershire . In the next match against Yorkshire , Miller took 6 / 42 , including the prized wicket of Hutton , as the home team were demolished for just 71 . Australia then struggled to 101 , including a counterattacking 34 from Miller , who took 3 / 49 in the second innings in an Australian victory . 
 In a later match , against Essex , Miller was involved in a famous incident that is frequently cited when his character is discussed ; it also spotlighted his differences with Bradman . On a day when the Australians set a world @-@ record of 721 runs in a single day , Miller came to the crease with his side already dominating , with the score 2 / 364 . He deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball , much to Bradman 's displeasure , in a protest against the one @-@ sided nature of the contest . 
 Australia then took on the MCC at Lord 's ; effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests as many of England 's Test players were in the MCC team . Miller scored 163 in 250 minutes , hitting 20 fours and three sixes in another innings win . Soon after , Rawtenstall dropped the contract dispute with Miller after being offered compensation . 
 Following another good all @-@ round performance against Hampshire , top @-@ scoring in the first innings and taking 5 / 25 in the second , Miller went into the First Test ( at Trent Bridge ) in fine form . On the first morning , Miller bowled Hutton and Compton on his way to 3 / 38 , helping Australia dismiss England cheaply and seize the initiative . Miller scored a duck , but Australia took a 344 @-@ run lead on the first innings . In the second innings , he resumed his battle with Hutton and Compton , delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day . The batsmen survived , but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd . The next day , he bowled Hutton for 74 and then bounced Compton , causing him to fall onto his stumps for 184 . Australia won by eight wickets , Miller ending with 4 / 125 for the second innings and 7 / 163 for the match . 
 Miller was unfit to bowl during the Second Test at Lord 's . During England 's first innings , Bradman threw Miller the ball , hoping that he would reverse his decision not to bowl . Miller refused and returned the ball , citing his back . Miller 's action generated news headlines , with journalists believing that he had disobeyed Bradman . 
 As a batsman , Miller was out for four in the first innings , not offering a shot to an inswinger . In the second innings , Miller 's first ball was a hat @-@ trick ball from English captain Norman Yardley ; he survived a loud leg before wicket appeal and then hit a six into the grandstand , on his way to 74 . Australia declared at 7 / 460 , 595 runs ahead . Miller took three catches as Australia won by 409 runs . 
 After the Lord 's Test , Miller enjoyed a night out and returned to the team hotel after daybreak the next morning . Australia were due to play Surrey at The Oval that day . With Australia in the field , Bradman sent Miller to the fine leg boundary as a punishment — between overs , he was forced to walk the length of the field . One of the spectators felt sorry for Miller and lent him his bicycle , which Miller used to cycle around the circumference of the ground . 
 The efforts of Miller and Lindwall against Hutton had led the English selectors to drop the Yorkshireman for the Third Test . The Australians were surprised by the move and thought that it was a bad move by their opponents . Miller had a quiet Third Test at Old Trafford , taking one wicket and scoring 31 as the match ended in a draw . In a rain @-@ shortened match , Miller again earned the ire of the crowd , after aiming a series of bouncers at Edrich , in apparent retaliation to the Englishman 's bouncing of Lindwall . He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman ordered him to stop . 
 The teams moved to Headingley for the Fourth Test at Leeds . Hutton had been recalled and the home team batted first . England tallied 496 and Miller took 1 / 43 . In reply , Australia were struggling at 3 / 68 in reply on the third morning . Neil Harvey , playing his first Ashes Test , joined Miller at the crease . The pair launched a counterattack , with Miller taking the lead . He hoisted Jim Laker 's first ball over square leg for six . Miller struck consecutive sixes over long off and the sightscreen respectively . This allowed Australia to seize the initiative ; Harvey joined in and hit consecutive boundaries against Laker . Miller then lifted another six over long off , and another over long on from Norman Yardley . He was dismissed for 58 attempting another six . The partnership had yielded 121 runs in only 90 minutes , and was described by Wisden as a " hurricane " . John Arlott described the innings as the most memorable that he had witnessed . He said " Miller played like an emperor ... Every stroke would have been memorable but each one had bettered its predecessor " . Jack Fingleton said that he had never " known a more enjoyable hour " of " delectable cricket " . The momentum swung and Australia finished at 457 on the fourth day , having added almost 396 in one day 's play . Miller took 1 / 53 in the second innings as Australia were set a world record chase of 404 on the final day . He made only 12 but Australia broke the world record to take a 3 – 0 lead . 
 The Australians moved onto the next match against Derbyshire , where Miller scored a half @-@ century and took 3 / 31 in an innings victory . Against Glamorgan , Miller took two wickets before striking a hard @-@ hitting 84 with five sixes . He struck one of the sixes with one hand , sending it 20 rows into the crowd . In a match against Lancashire , Jack Ikin had reached 99 despite being repeatedly hit . Miller refused to bowl to Ikin , saying that he felt the batsman deserved a century . Lindwall was given the ball and promptly removed Ikin for 99 . 
 The teams proceeded to The Oval for the Fifth Test . After England elected to bat , Miller bowled John Dewes with his second ball and then removed Jack Crapp without scoring , leaving England at 4 / 23 . Miller ended with 2 / 5 as Lindwall ( 6 / 20 ) cut down the home team for 52 . In his last Test innings for the summer , Miller scored five . Australia led by 337 on the first innings and Miller dismissed Hutton and Crapp to end with 2 / 22 as Australia won by an innings and took a 4 – 0 series win . Miller ended the Tests with 184 runs at 26 @.@ 28 and 13 wickets at 23 @.@ 15 . He took eight catches . 
 In a match against the Gentlemen of England at Lord 's , Miller scored 69 and was dismissed attempting a third consecutive hooked boundary . Australia went through the remaining tour matches unbeaten to end the summer without a defeat . 
 After the tour , Bradman was full of praise for Miller , though somewhat critical of his aggressive batting : 
 One of the most volatile cricketers of any age . Long , rangy , athletic type — drove the ball with tremendous power — tried to hit sixes with abandon . Many of them would have been prodigious . Would have been a far better player had he curbed this propensity and showed more judgement in his hitting . Dangerous bowler with the new ball , swinging it both ways not much short of [ Ray ] Lindwall 's speed . [ ... ] In 1948 he was the best slip field in the world . Altogether , a crowd @-@ pleasing personality ... whose limitations were caused mainly by his own failure to concentrate . 
 Miller totalled 1 @,@ 088 runs for the tour at an average of 47 @.@ 30 , only the eighth highest in the squad . He took 56 wickets at 17 @.@ 58 and held onto 20 catches . 
 = = = Omission for South Africa = = = 
 After returning to Australia , Miller played against Bradman in a testimonial match in 1948 – 49 . Miller bowled three consecutive bouncers at Bradman , dismissing him with the last of the short @-@ pitched deliveries for 53 . Bradman was angered by Miller 's bowling . One week later , the squad to tour South Africa in the following season was announced , and Miller was omitted , despite being ranked as the best all rounder in the world . During the Australian season , which was a purely domestic one , he had scored 400 runs at 33 @.@ 33 and taken 11 wickets at 24 @.@ 09 . He scored one century against Queensland during the season , as well as a 99 against Victoria at the SCG . The surprise omission led to much conjecturing about the reasoning . One was that Miller had stated during the season that he did not want to bowl , so the selectors only considered his batting performances . Another was that Miller 's bouncing of Bradman had provoked his former captain into voting against him at the selection table . Rumours circulated that new captain Lindsay Hassett did not want Miller on the tour because he was undisciplined , which Hassett denied . Another was that Jack Ryder , the Victorian selector and former Australian captain , had voted against Miller in retaliation for his move to New South Wales . Both Bradman and Chappie Dwyer claimed they voted for Miller , leading Miller to quip " somebody 's telling lies " , as there were only three on the selection panel . 
 The media stridently criticised Miller 's omission , as did former players such as Stan McCabe and Alan Kippax . During the off season , he worked as a journalist and played baseball , but declined a trial with a Major League Baseball club , the Boston Red Sox . Miller captained New South Wales at the start of the 1949 – 50 season as his colleagues went to South Africa , his first leadership experience in the Sheffield Shield . He scored 80 and took six wickets in the first match against Queensland . After another victory over Western Australia , he received a request from the Australian Board of Control . At the request of captain Hassett , Miller was asked to tour South Africa as cover for Johnston , who had been injured in a car crash . Miller accepted the offer and resigned himself to bowling heavily . Miller almost missed the trip after arriving late at the dock in Perth after a drunken night . The next boat to South Africa would not have departed for several weeks . Despite his recall , there remained tension over his initial omission , as Dwyer was the team manager . 
 Miller was given the responsibility of batting in the number three position when Hassett was afflicted by tonsillitis . In the First Test at Johannesburg , Miller scored 21 and then took 5 / 40 in South Africa 's first innings , only his second match on tour , resulting in the home side being forced to follow on and lose by an innings . In the Second Test at Cape Town , he scored 58 and then took 3 / 54 in the first innings . On the third morning , Miller crashed his car and arrived late to the ground , still putting on his trousers as he entered the playing field . Despite , this he dismissed Dudley Nourse with his third ball . He was wicketless in the second innings , and took only one in the Third Test in Durban and did not pass 10 with the bat . Australia won both matches . He returned to the form in the Fourth Test with 84 , 33 not out and 3 / 75 in a high scoring draw . Miller took match figures of 5 / 66 in the Fifth Test as Australia took the series 4 – 0 . He ended the series with 246 runs at 41 @.@ 00 and 17 wickets at 22 @.@ 94 , placing in the top six in the Test averages for bat and ball . During the tour matches , he took match figures of 11 / 54 against Natal Country Districts and scored a century against Transvaal . 
 = = = Ashes in Australia = = = 
 Miller started the 1950 – 51 season with an unbeaten 201 in a Shield match against Queensland . At 438 minutes , it was his longest first @-@ class innings . In the return match , he scored 138 not out in just 118 minutes in a successful run @-@ chase , a sharp contrast to his double @-@ century . In a tour match against the visiting England team at the SCG before the Test series , Miller scored 214 , having been 99 not out at stumps on the previous day . He hit 15 fours and three sixes . However , he made ducks in consecutive matches leading into the First Test in Brisbane . Miller scored 15 and eight on a rain @-@ affected pitch , and took match figures of 3 / 50 in an Australian victory , dismissing Dewes twice . He had another quiet match in the Second Test , scoring 18 and 14 and taking a match total of 2 / 55 . After struggling in the first two Tests , Miller rediscovered his batting form with 98 against the tourists for New South Wales . 
 England had started the Third Test at Sydney strongly . Australia took its first wicket when Miller caught Washbrook from Johnson with a horizontal diving catch at slip . England were still in control at 1 / 128 when Miller came on to bowl . He removed Hutton and Reg Simpson before bowling Compton for a duck . In the space of four overs from Miller , England were now 4 / 137 . Miller had contributed to all four wickets . Miller ended with 4 / 37 as England were bowled out for 290 on the second day . Miller batted patiently on the third day , reaching 96 by stumps with Australia at 6 / 362 . The next day , with his century four runs away , Miller arrived late , leaving his batting partner Johnson waiting at the players ' gate . Miller progressed to 145 not out despite the interruption . It has been a patient innings by his standards , taking almost a day . England collapsed for 123 , leaving Australia to take an innings victory . In the first innings of the Fourth Test in Sydney , Miller scored 44 and did not take a wicket , but he was heading for consecutive Test centuries in the second innings . He reached 99 when a leg break from Doug Wright spun across him and clipped the off bail . The innings helped Australia to set England a target of 503 . Miller took 3 / 27 on the final day , helping to cut through the middle order as Australia won by 274 runs . Miller was out for seven and a duck in the Fifth Test at the MCG . He took 4 / 76 in the first innings , joining Lindwall in cutting down the middle order , despite which England won by eight wickets . Miller topped the Test batting averages with 350 runs at 43 @.@ 75 , and for the entire first @-@ class season , he scored 1332 runs at 78 @.@ 35 , the highest among all comers . His bowling was also strong , with 17 wickets at 17 @.@ 70 , second only to Jack Iverson ( 21 wickets at 15 @.@ 23 ) . However , an attack by Morris ( 182 ) and Miller ( 83 ) in a Shield match dispirited Iverson , and he never played Test cricket again . 
 = = = West Indies tour Australia = = = 
 The 1951 – 52 Australian season saw the first tour by a West Indian team in two decades . The Caribbean team had beaten England 3 – 1 in 1950 and were regarded as the biggest threat to Australia since Bodyline . The batting was led by the " three Ws " : Everton Weekes , Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott . The English had also been bamboozled by the leg spin and left arm orthodox of Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine , who took 59 wickets between them in four Tests against England . Miller and Lindwall were charged with attacking the opposition batsmen , testing them with short @-@ pitched bowling . The West Indies batted first in the First Test at Brisbane and were dismissed for 216 ; Miller dismissing their captain John Goddard . Miller came to the crease at 3 / 80 and could not pick Ramadhin . He decided to attack the leg spinner without picking him . He missed some , was dropped twice and hit a six before falling for 46 to Valentine . Australia scraped out a 10 @-@ run lead . Miller took another wicket in the second innings but managed only four as Australia stumbled to a three @-@ wicket victory . Between Tests , Miller took eight wickets in the match as New South Wales beat the tourists in a tour match . In the Second Test at Sydney , Miller came to the crease at 3 / 106 having gone wicketless in the West Indies ' first innings of 362 . He began to pick Ramadhin and finished with 129 in 246 minutes . Miller and Hassett put on 235 , an Australian Test record for any wicket against the West Indies . Ramadhin ended with 1 / 196 and was demoralised . In the second innings , Miller took 3 / 50 with a heavy barrage of short balls and claimed two catches to help Australia to a seven @-@ wicket victory . Wisden decried Lindwall and Miller 's " relentless bumper tactics " . 
 Miller had a lean Third Test , taking only one wicket and scoring four and 35 , as Australia lost by six wickets . In the Fourth Test at the MCG , the West Indies batted first and Miller removed both openers in the first hour , before returning to end with 5 / 60 as the tourists were bowled out for 272 . He then scored 47 as Australia managed only 216 . He took 2 / 49 , but only scored two in Australia 's run @-@ chase of 259 . The home team won by one wicket . In the Fifth Test , Miller took 5 / 26 in the first innings with another concentrated display of short @-@ pitched bowling , and then scored 69 in the second innings . He took two further wickets in the second innings as Australia fell short of their target . Miller ended the series as the leading bowler , with 20 wickets at 19 @.@ 90 . He was second in the batting , with 362 runs at 40 @.@ 22 . Throughout the series , Miller and Lindwall were repeatedly successful with their concerted bouncer tactics , which were heavily criticised . 
 After the Test series ended , Miller captained a Commonwealth XI that played against a touring England team in Colombo , Ceylon . England had been on a tour of the Indian subcontinent . Miller scored 106 as the Commonwealth compiled 517 . Miller took three wickets in the first innings and led his team to a victory by an innings and 259 runs . 
 = = = Captain of New South Wales = = = 
 At the start of the 1952 – 53 season , the New South Wales Cricket Association 's five @-@ man selection panel installed Miller as captain in place of Morris . This was despite Morris leading the state to the Sheffield Shield in the previous season . Miller did not lobby for the job , but the Sydney media had campaigned for Miller , suggesting that his flamboyant style would attract more spectators and help stem the financial losses of the NSWCA . Despite this , Morris remained the Test vice @-@ captain ahead of Miller . 
 In his first match as leader , Miller scored 109 against Queensland . Taking 260 minutes , it was the slowest century of his career . In another match against the touring South Africans , Miller elected to field and reduced his opponents to 3 / 3 and went on to win by five wickets . His players respected him , and some began to mimic his cough , voice , gait and idiosyncrasies . Richie Benaud unbuttoned his shirt in Miller 's mould . He captained in an unorthodox manner , often trying unusual ploys to unsettle the opposition . He encouraged the opposition to attack in an attempt to get a wicket , and often shuffled his batting order to suit the circumstances of his batsmen . He was soon called before authorities after a match against South Australia . Sid Barnes , his 12th man , had come onto the ground with drinks , dressed as a flight attendant . He also brought things such as cigars , mirrors and combs . Barnes ' antics extended the break longer than usual . Miller was called before the NSWCA after the South Australian Cricket Association lodged a complaint , and had to give an assurance that such an incident would not be repeated . 
 Miller started the Test series against South Africa poorly . Suffering from a throat infection , he scored three in both innings and took 1 / 46 in an Australian victory . In the Second Test at the MCG , Miller performed consistently with bat and ball , taking 4 / 62 and 3 / 51 and scoring 52 and 31 . In the course of the match , he passed the all @-@ round double of 1000 Test runs and 100 Test wickets when he dismissed John Waite in the second innings , but this was not enough to prevent defeat . In the Third Test , Miller scored 55 , putting on 168 with Harvey , and took 3 / 48 and 2 / 33 in an innings victory . Australia 's fortunes took a turn for the worse in the Fourth Test in Adelaide . Miller scored nine and injured his back after two overs with the ball . Lindwall also broke down . Without their spearheads , Australia were unable to bowl out the South Africans and match was drawn . Both were ruled out of the Fifth Test and the South Africans levelled the series despite conceding 520 runs during the first innings . Australia 's bowlers were unable to stop the South African batsmen without their new ball pair . 
 = = = 1953 Ashes tour = = = 
 Australia proceeded to the 1953 Ashes tour . During a stopover at Naples , Miller was locked inside after entering a private opera rehearsal without authorisation , but managed to escape and rejoin the boat as it was about to leave . During his career , several cricket books were published under Miller 's name , and he was embroiled in further controversy when one ghost @-@ written tome , which was printed as the team left for England , criticised his captain Hassett as being too cautious . 
 The burden on Miller and Lindwall increased when Johnston broke down in an early tour game . Miller was wicketless against Worcestershire , but succeeded with the bat , scoring an unbeaten 220 in just over six hours . He then scored 159 not out against Yorkshire . At this point , Miller had scored 421 runs in the week of May , and the media began to speculate that he could score 1000 runs in one month , something that had been done on a tour only by Bradman . 
 Miller 's love of horseracing then interfered with his quest . Wanting to attend an afternoon race meeting , he opened the batting in the morning against Cambridge University . Not intending to play a long innings , he attacked the bowling and was out for 20 , before heading for the track . He stayed at the track until late afternoon , and returned to find the Australians walking out to field . This was followed by a match against the MCC at Lord 's where he took four wickets of English Test players . Miller then took match figures of 5 / 27 against Oxford University . In the match against Essex , Miller pulled rib muscles , meaning he could not bowl in the First Test at Trent Bridge . He scored 55 and five in a rain @-@ affected draw . 
 Australia travelled to Bramall Lane under the captaincy of Miller . Captain Hassett and his deputy Morris were rested and stayed in London with the team manager . After the first day 's play , he organised a party for that lasted until the next afternoon — the rest day . He woke up with a hangover the next day just minutes before the start of play . Improvising , Miller arrived at the ground in a hearse . When it was Australia 's turn to bat , Miller was the last man to be dismissed , having scored 86 despite his hangover . 
 The Test series moved to Lord 's . Miller resumed bowling , sending down 42 overs and taking a total of 1 / 74 . He managed 25 in the first innings , but promoted to number three in the second innings , he batted patiently to reach stumps before reaching his first Test century on English soil the following morning , but England held on for a draw . More than half of the Third Test at Old Trafford was washed out , resulting in another draw . Miller took 1 / 38 bowling fast off breaks and scored 17 and six . Australia then played Middlesex at Lord 's , where Miller scored a hard @-@ hitting 71 . 
 Australia elected to field on a wet wicket in the Fourth Test at Headingley . Miller dismissed Edrich and Graveney and ended with 2 / 39 from 38 overs as England were bowled out for 167 . Miller made only five in the first innings . In the second innings , Miller and Lindwall launched a short @-@ pitched barrage and dismissed Watson and Simpson in consecutive balls . England were 5 / 177 a stumps on day four , leading by 78 . The pacemen were booed from the field . The next day , Miller dismissed Evans early , before Trevor Bailey began his resistance . Frustrated by Bailey 's defensive style and time @-@ wasting , Miller lost his cool and aimed a beamer straight at Bailey 's head , further angering the crowd . Miller ended with 4 / 63 from a long spell of 47 overs . England held on for another draw after more time @-@ wasting by Bailey . The teams headed for the Fifth Test at The Oval tied 0 – 0 . Miller 's last Test performance was his least productive ; he scored one and a duck and took a total of 2 / 89 . England won the match and regained the Ashes . Miller 's returns were below his career standards , with 223 runs at 24 @.@ 77 and 10 wickets at 30 @.@ 30 . He took two catches . 
 Miller scored 67 against the Gentlemen of England at Lord 's and then played against the Combined Services at Kingston . He reached his century before lunch and then proceeded to 262 not out with 24 boundaries . This included a 377 @-@ run fourth @-@ wicket stand by Jim de Courcy in only 205 minutes , in particular targeting Fred Trueman 's bowling . He then took 3 / 17 with the ball . He finished the English summer with 1 @,@ 433 runs at 51 @.@ 17 , the second highest average behind Harvey among batsmen with over 200 runs . He was the only Australian to hit two double centuries and also took 45 wickets at 22 @.@ 51 . For his efforts that summer , Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack named him one of its Five Cricketers of the Year . 
 = = = Overlooked for Test captaincy = = = 
 Miller returned to Australia and led New South Wales to the Sheffield Shield title in 1953 – 54 . He topped the Australian first @-@ class batting averages with 71 @.@ 10 , but had his poorest season with the ball , taking only 16 wickets at 38 @.@ 75 . The season was purely domestic with no touring side and therefore no Test matches . The season was also a transition point in Australian cricket , as Hassett retired upon return to Australia . Initially , Morris and Miller were the two frontrunners for the captaincy . Miller was the state captain , but Morris was the vice @-@ captain of the Test team ahead of Miller . At the time , Johnson had been dropped from the Australian team , but inherited the Victorian captaincy from Hassett , who accused him of not trying . Hassett told Johnson that he could become Test captain if he regained his form and his Test position . As the outgoing captain , Hassett was believed to have an influence over the selection of his successor . Miller had also criticised Hassett in his book , and there was talk that Hassett was upset about Miller 's departure from South Melbourne and Victoria . Johnson returned to form with 45 wickets at 22 @.@ 75 for the season . 
 England toured Australia in the 1954 – 55 season . Johnson was selected to lead an Australian XI in a tour match against the Englishmen before the Tests , an indication of the selectors ' inclination . He took 6 / 66 in England 's only innings . The build @-@ up featured a media war , with Melbourne newspapers stumping for Johnson while the Sydney journalists trumpeted Miller . Miller warmed up for the Tests with 86 for New South Wales against England . On 18 November , the Australian Board of Control selected Johnson as captain , with Morris as his deputy . Miller 's irreverent nature was cited as a possible reason for the board 's selection . Johnson was regarded as a superior diplomat , while Miller had a reputation for turning up late and being undisciplined . Miller had frequently been in dispute with Bradman , who was a member of the board and the chairman of selectors . Miller had also questioned where revenue that the board collected from ticket sales was being used . Others claimed that Johnson was appointed because he was part of the establishment ; his father Bill was a former Australian selector . The decision was bitterly criticised by the Sydney press . 
 There is strong feeling amongst cricket enthusiasts that horse trading on a state basis rather than objective evaluation of cricket skills has dominated selectors discussions . The operating principle seems to have been " you look after my man and we 'll look after yours . " 
 Miller scored 49 in the First Test at Brisbane as Australia amassed 8 / 601 , before dismissing Simpson and Hutton as England fell to an innings defeat . A knee injury forced Miller to miss the Second Test at the SCG , which England won . Miller returned for the Third Test at the MCG , but was initially unavailable to bowl due to lingering knee problems . However , upon receiving an inquiry about the health of his knee before the match by Prime Minister of Australia Robert Menzies , Miller agreed to try to bowl for a short period and lift his team . England elected to bat and Miller removed Hutton , Edrich and Compton with his outswinger . He ended up bowling for the entire first session of play and had 3 / 5 at lunch from nine overs , before finishing at 3 / 14 . England were bowled out for 191 . Miller struggled with the bat , scoring six and seven as Frank Tyson 's pace saw England inflict a second successive defeat on Australia . Australia needed to win the Fourth Test in Adelaide to keep the series alive . Miller scored 44 and 14 as Australia were bowled out in the second innings to leave England with 94 for victory . Miller made a late burst , removing Edrich , Hutton and Colin Cowdrey in consecutive overs to leave England at 3 / 18 . He then took a difficult catch from Johnston to dismiss Peter May . England were then 4 / 49 but hung on to win by five wickets and secure the Ashes . It was the first time that Australia had lost three consecutive Tests since the Bodyline series of 1932 – 33 . Miller made 19 and 28 in the rain @-@ affected draw in the Fifth Test . He ended the series with 167 runs at 23 @.@ 86 , his lowest ever at international level , and took 10 wickets at 24 @.@ 30 . 
 He had more success as domestic level . New South Wales beat Victoria in two days at the SCG to win the Sheffield Shield ; Miller taking five wickets in the second innings . He also led his state in a 45 @-@ run win over the tourists , their only defeat apart from the First Test . The match was marked by a quickfire 71 in 57 minutes and his team 's attacking strategy . 
 = = = West Indies tour = = = 
 After leading his state to another Sheffield Shield title and a win over England , Miller replaced Morris as the vice @-@ captain for the tour of the West Indies that started in early 1955 . Australia was looking for its first series win against any team in three years , having lost two consecutive series to England . Australia batted first in the opening Test at Sabina Park in Jamaica . Miller came to the wicket at 2 / 137 and put on a 224 @-@ run partnership with Harvey . Both ended with centuries and Miller scored his highest Test score of 147 , striking 15 fours . When Valentine and Ramadhin had conceded 100 runs , he respectively shook their hands . Australia finished at 9 / 515 . Johnson had been injured when hit in the foot by a yorker so Miller was left in charge of the team on the field with Australia one bowler short . Miller attempted to unsettle the batsmen by placing many men close to the bat in an attempt to insult their batting capabilities . He took the new ball at 5 / 239 and the hosts collapsed to be all out for 259 . Miller had taken 2 / 36 , and enforced the follow @-@ on , which was questioned as paceman Ron Archer had broken down . With Australia two bowlers short , the West Indies moved to 1 / 114 . When Weekes arrived at the crease , Miller unsettled him with delaying tactics , and he was out for one . He then placed two silly points and two silly mid @-@ ons in an attempt to unsettle Walcott , who fell to Lindwall soon after . Miller then took two wickets and the hosts had lost three wickets in as many overs . The West Indies were bowled out and Australia won by nine wickets . Miller had taken 3 / 62 in the second innings . 
 Johnson resumed the leadership on the field in the Second Test at Queen 's Park Oval in Trinidad . The match was a high @-@ scoring draw , but Miller scored only three and took match figures of 1 / 148 . In the Third Test at Georgetown , Guyana , Miller removed both openers in the first innings and then scored 33 as Australia by eight wickets . He took 3 / 51 for the match . In the Fourth Test at Bridgetown , Barbados , Miller came to the wicket with Australia at 3 / 226 on the first day . The tourists lost two more wickets to be 5 / 233 . Miller and Archer launched a counter @-@ attacking partnership of 206 . Miller reached 137 and then walked after edging a ball , even though none of the opposition had appealed . Australia reached 668 and the West Indies were struggling at 6 / 147 , with Miller having dismissed Weekes and Collie Smith in the same over . At the time , Miller was bowling at medium pace , but Johnson felt that the new batsmen Denis Atkinson and <unk> Depeiaza were vulnerable to express pace . Johnson ordered Miller to bowl fast , but was turned down . Johnson replaced Miller with Lindwall , who was tired and was hit around the ground . The pair seized the initiative and compiled a world Test record of 347 for the seventh wicket and the Australians were tired after failing to break the partnership . Miller attacked Johnson in front of the other players , saying " You couldn 't captain a bunch of bloody schoolboys ! " Johnson then offered to resolve the dispute " out the back " , implying a fisticuffs . 
 Miller declined the offer and stopped . The match resumed the next day and the West Indies were eventually bowled out 158 behind . Miller had been punished by the batsmen , taking 2 / 113 from 22 overs . Miller scored 10 and took 1 / 66 in the second innings as the match ended in a high @-@ scoring draw . Miller then took 6 / 107 in the first innings of the Fifth Test in Jamaica . He removed John Holt , Walcott and Smith , before taking three tail @-@ end wickets as the home team were bowled out for 357 . When Australia batted , Miller arrived at the crease to join Harvey with the score at 3 / 302 . He added his third century of the series and ended with 109 as Australia reached 8 / 758 . He took 2 / 58 in the second innings as Australia completed a 3 – 0 win . It was Miller 's most statistically successful series , with 439 runs at 73 @.@ 17 and the 20 wickets at 32 @.@ 05 made him the equal leading wicket @-@ taker along with Lindwall . 
 = = = Final domestic season = = = 
 Miller started the 1955 – 56 season , which was purely domestic , with 164 against Queensland in Brisbane . On the final day , Miller set the hosts 275 for victory in three hours . He lengthened the innings break by seven minutes , by remonstrating with officials to pause the match for the running of the Melbourne Cup . They agreed and the match was stopped for 13 minutes for the race . Queensland lost seven wickets but held on for a draw , aided by the 20 minutes lost by Miller 's love of horseracing . 
 The next match was against South Australia in Sydney . New South Wales had declared at 8 / 215 and the visitors were 0 / 2 at stumps on the first day . Miller 's wife gave birth to their fourth child , and Miller was drinking into the next morning . He then arrived at the SCG , having forgotten to pick up team @-@ mate Peter Philpott as arranged , so he had to rush back and the pair arrived late for the day 's play . Miller was still in a tuxedo as play was about to start . Miller completed the unfinished over from the previous night and felt that the pitch did not offer any assistance . He then told Alan Davidson to bowl the next over from his end . However , as Davidson was about to bowl , Miller changed his mind and took over . Miller bowled Les Favell in the over . He kept on bowling and finished with 7 / 12 from 7 @.@ 3 overs , clean bowling five of his victims . The visitors had been levelled for 27 , the lowest score in the history of the Sheffield Shield . Miller then asked South Australia to follow @-@ on , but showed little interest in bowling again , delivering only six overs despite the bowler @-@ friendly conditions . Philpott said that " this was typical Miller . He was never an accumulator of records , not particularly concerned with figures . " In another incident , Miller had been making a speech at a civic reception for the New South Wales team in the town of Maitland . In front of the mayor at the town hall , he praised the hospitality , before turning around to his players and asking what the name of the town was . Miller then turned up late to a coaching clinic the next day and instead of teaching , he made a speech , advising the children to play tennis as there was more money on offer . 
 In January 1956 , Miller injured his back in a match against Queensland . He suffered spasms that forced him to miss the rest of the season . He had scored 403 runs at 80 @.@ 60 and taken 19 wickets at 14 @.@ 94 . New South Wales again won the Sheffield Shield . 
 = = = Final Ashes tour = = = 
 Miller was selected for the 1956 Ashes tour , but could not bowl for a month because of a back injury from the first match . Miller captained the Australians against Leicester . Coming in at 3 / 175 , Miller made his highest first @-@ class score of 281 not out , striking 35 fours in six and a half hours . A tougher fight awaited against Surrey at The Oval , who had England 's Test spin combination of Laker and Tony Lock . Miller came in at 3 / 124 and struggled , scoring 18 runs in his first 120 minutes , his slowest two hours of scoring in his career . As his partners continued to fall Miller ended unbeaten on 57 as Australia were bowled out for 259 ; Laker taking all ten wickets . Australia lost by ten wickets , its first loss to a county since 1912 . As a result , sections of the Australian media began campaigning for Miller to replace Johnson as captain . 
 By the First Test at Trent Bridge , Miller was shouldering most of the bowling load . He sent down 52 overs in a rain @-@ affected match , taking match figures of 6 / 127 . He struggled with the bat , making a duck and four . The teams headed to Lord 's where Miller had to carry the pace attack without the injured Davidson and Lindwall . Crawford and Ken Mackay were called in to make their debut and support Miller with the pace duties . Australia batted first and Miller managed 28 . Australia managed only 285 and Crawford injured himself , exacerbating the burden on Miller . Miller had Peter Richardson and then bowled Tom Graveney with an outswinger . England were 2 / 32 and their captain Peter May received an inswinger from Miller first ball , which he inside edged onto his stumps , but the bail was not dislodged . The next day , Miller beat May four times and then had Watson caught in the gully in his third over . He then removed Bailey and Trueman . Miller 's 5 / 72 was largely responsible for England falling for 171 . Australia was in difficulty at 3 / 69 when Miller came to bat , hitting a counterattacking 30 . Australia set England 371 to win . Miller removed Graveney at the start of the run chase . Resuming the next morning , he bowled Watson , and had May and Evans both caught behind . He bowled Johnny Wardle and took his only ten @-@ wicket match haul in Tests . Australia won by 185 runs and Miller had bowled 70 @.@ 1 overs for the match . His knee had taken a heavy toll and Miller was given an extended break had to play purely as a batsman in the Third Test at Headingley . Australia were caught on a wet wicket in response to England 's 325 , and Miller top @-@ scored with 41 and Australia were forced to follow on . He had attempted to keep Laker and Lock at bay with his pads . In the second innings , Miller fell for 26 to Laker . Australia lost by an innings , for the first time in a Test in 18 years . 
 The Australian press attacked the team , and called for changes , including the omission of the captain , Johnson . Johnson , Miller and Gil Langley were the tour selectors . Langley and Miller were willing to omit Johnson only if the captain volunteered to stand aside . Johnson did not volunteer , so the others did not discuss the topic . Miller and Johnson had both been appointed as Members of the Order of the British Empire ( MBE ) in the 1956 New Year Honours , and between the Tests they attended their formal investiture . 
 The curator at Old Trafford had been ordered to prepare a dusty , spinning pitch for the Fourth Test . A win for England would see them retain the Ashes . Miller bowled 21 wicketless overs as England amassed 459 . Miller was out for six and a duck and fell twice to Laker , who took a world record 19 wickets as Australia lost by an innings . Wisden reported that the Australians were said " to be extremely bitter over the condition of the pitch " . 
 Miller then took 5 / 84 against Surrey , before leading the team against Warwickshire . He had received death threats in the lead @-@ up to the game , ordering him to lose . He scored 46 not out and took 2 / 13 as Australia won by an innings . He then took 5 / 29 in the second innings against Lancashire and made 50 and took match figures of 5 / 78 against Essex . 
 On the eve of the Fifth Test at The Oval , Miller announced that the tour would be his last , so that he would retire from cricket after the tour of the Indian subcontinent on the return voyage . In his final Test on English soil , he took 4 / 91 in the first innings . Miller came in to bat at 5 / 47 and helped Australia recover to 202 , top @-@ scoring with 61 . He took another one wicket in the second innings and was unbeaten on seven when stumps were drawn in the second innings . The series ended 1 – 2 . He ended the series with 199 runs at 28 @.@ 43 and topped the bowling with 21 wickets at 22 @.@ 23 . He topped the first @-@ class bowling for the Australians with 50 wickets at 19 @.@ 60 . 
 Australia played Pakistan at Karachi in the first Test between the two countries on a matting pitch , rather than the more familiar grass pitch . Miller top @-@ scored in the first innings with 21 , as Australia fell for 80 . He took 2 / 40 and then scored 11 in the second innings as Australia fell to defeat . It was the last Test of his career , as his knee injury deteriorated to the point that he could not play in the three Tests against India , and retired upon his return to Australia . 
 = = Style and personality = = 
 Miller combined classy strokeplay with big hitting , his front foot play especially devastating . He had a rifle like straight drive , played pull and sweep shots with a minimum of effort and was able to cut elegantly . He combined this elegance with unorthodoxy , hitting two sixes over square leg with a backhand tennis shot and once beginning the day 's play in a Test match with a six . One straight six that he hit at the Sydney Cricket Ground was still rising when it hit the first deck of the M.A. Noble Stand . Len Hutton said he was " the most unpredictable cricketer I have played against " . 
 As a bowler , Miller had a classically high arm action , moving the ball sharply either way and able to make the ball rise from a good length . His action caused opposition batsmen to perceive that his deliveries were gaining pace after pitching . He was often able to generate more pace than his new ball partner , Lindwall . He was always willing to try something new if the batsman were set , varying his approach from fifteen paces to five and vice versa . A round arm delivery often managed to capture a wicket , surprising the batsman . Compton said that Miller " often had no preconceived idea what he intended to bowl even as he turned to start his run " . Miller often mixed slow leg breaks when he was bowling off a run . He once bowled English opening batsman David Sheppard with a googly during a Test . Hutton opined that Miller was the bowler who was least concerned with the position of his bowling mark , and said that he " never felt physically safe against him " . His use of bouncers at Trent Bridge during the 1948 tour was seen as excessive by the English crowd , who booed him . Miller simply sat down until the barracking had subsided . He was often required to bowl through pain , pressing a disk into place at the base of his spine before sending down the next delivery . 
 Miller and Lindwall formed an opening partnership that was regarded as one of the greatest of all time . Hutton said that the pair was the most hostile that he faced during his career . Alan Davidson , a bowling all rounder who supported Lindwall and Miller for New South Wales and Australia , said that " Ray Lindwall was the best bowler I ever saw of any type ; his control was just perfect . At the other end you had Miller , who was unpredictable ... It really was a perfect team . " He was an acrobatic slips fielder , who would take freakish catches with nonchalant ease , often immediately returning to his discussion with those around him as if nothing was unusual . 
 Miller often required a contest to retain interest in the game . He deplored Bradman 's ruthless attitude towards annihilating the opposition and sometimes refused to try when Australia was in an unassailable position . At Southend in 1948 , as the Australians scored a world record 721 runs in a single day against Essex , Miller , coming in to bat when the score was 2 / 364 , allowed himself to be bowled first ball . Indeed , he " turned to the wicketkeeper and said : " Thank God that 's over " . " His teammate Sid Barnes said that if Miller " had the same outlook as Bradman or Ponsford he would have made colossal scores " and become " the statisticians ' greatest customer " . 
 Miller never captained Australia in a Test , as his attitude to the game tended to alarm the authorities . About Miller , Ashley Mallett wrote , " He loved tradition , but hated convention . His unstructured way of playing and living would be anathema to cricketers now ... He played as he fought the war , by impulse and mood . " He sometimes set his field by saying to his players : " scatter " . On another occasion , he is reported turned to his players , after being told that NSW was taking the field with one player too many , and asked for one player to volunteer to " piss off " . 
 A larger than life character , Miller is the subject of many stories , often apocryphal . One story had Don Bradman answering a knock on the door late one night to see Miller dressed in a dinner suit . Miller advised Bradman that , as demanded , he was in bed at curfew and was now going out . His relationship with Bradman was one riddled with friction and mutual antipathy , " ... one a roundhead of massive influence , the other a cavalier and maverick " . As Bradman moved from batting hero and team captain to selector and administrator , his influence grew ; this " ... almost certainly cost Miller any chance of captaining his country " . 
 One night , following a duel with Messerschmitts in his Mosquito , he made an unauthorised detour over Bonn because it was Beethoven 's birthplace and he was a lover of the classics . Despite his fame , Miller remained a humble man ; when asked his favourite cricketing memory , he would recall no incident concerning himself , but " a South Australian team @-@ mate walking onto Lord 's to a thunderous ovation a few weeks after his release from a POW camp " . The cricket broadcaster , John Arlott said " that for all the glamour that attached to Miller , he was staunch and unaffected as a friend " . 
 When asked how he managed to take seven wickets for just 12 runs against South Australia , Miller replied : 
 There 's three reasons , First , I bowled bloody well . Second , I , <unk> ... second ... " [ pause ] . " You can forget about the other two reasons . " 
 = = Later life = = 
 After retirement , Miller remained in the public eye , augmented by persistent " unsubstantiated rumours of an affair with Princess Margaret " . He made a living as a journalist and columnist , employed by the Daily Express as a " special cricket writer " for twenty years . As during his career , Miller was a proponent of attacking and bright play . He praised the aggressive leadership of his protege Richie Benaud but criticised the style of play pursued by Australia under Benaud 's successors Bob Simpson and Bill Lawry . In the mid @-@ 1980s , when Australia was struggling , Miller called for the removal of Allan Border , an obdurate and defensive batsman , from the captaincy . 
 He later worked for Vernons Pools , owned by the millionaire horseracing entrepreneur , Robert Sangster . However , Miller " was happiest at the cricket or at the races " . He also worked as the head of a lobby group in promoting Australian rules football in his adopted New South Wales in the 1980s . At the time , the VFL was the dominant league and there were no top @-@ flight teams in his adopted state or Queensland . 
 Miller 's later life was plagued by ill health . In November 1991 , he was hospitalised with a stroke , and soon after fell over and broke his hip , necessitating two further operations . He had skin cancer , caused by his insistence on always displaying his mop of hair and not wearing a hat . He accepted these vicissitudes <unk> . " Some grieved to see him reduced , but not him ; these were life 's deliveries . He knew only that one would get him out eventually . " He had an earlobe removed . The cancer also attacked his legs , and coupled with his hip injury , severely curtailed his mobility , forcing him to use walking frames and wheelchairs . Asked at 75 about death , he said : " Never think about it . No regrets . I 've had a hell of a good life . Been damned lucky . " 
 Despite his illnesses , he continued to travel to England in the 1990s to watch cricket and meet up with Compton , Edrich and other war and cricket colleagues on an annual basis , although he became increasingly isolated as he outlasted his friends , both English and Australian . 
 In late 2002 , Miller divorced his wife Peg , with whom he had four sons . He did so to marry his long @-@ term mistress Marie <unk> , with whom he had been living since 1999 . <unk> was a hospital receptionist and Miller reasoned that he would receive more effective medical treatment by moving to Melbourne to live with her , as his specialist doctors also lived there . He had other long @-@ term mistresses , including an Australian beauty queen with whom he was photographed in public . During his later years , his illness contributed to what his family felt was a deteriorating attitude and he fell out with his sons , but they were reconciled shortly before his death . 
 Miller died in October 2004 after being in persistent poor health . He was given a state funeral by the Government of Victoria , which saw hundreds of mourners stand outside the packed cathedral , and was broadcast across the nation on ABC Radio . 
 = = Legacy and statistical analysis = = 
 Miller 's achievements were recognised by a host of awards during his lifetime and posthumously . Miller was one of the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 . In 2000 , he was named in the Australian Cricket Board Team of the Century as its vice @-@ captain . In January 2010 , Miller was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame . 
 He is also one of only four Australian cricketers , ( the others being Bradman , Victor Trumper and Shane Warne ) to be honoured with a portrait in the Long Room at Lord 's in London . Miller is one of only three men ( the others being M.H. " Vinoo " Mankad and <unk> " Garry " Sobers ) to have his name on both the batting and bowling honours boards in the visitors ' dressing @-@ room there , for scoring both a century and for taking five wickets in a test at the ground . 
 Miller 's abilities as an all @-@ rounder led to enormous success as both batsman and bowler . The ICC player rankings have been applied retrospectively to cricket history and Miller achieved top ten rankings with both bat and ball . As a batsman , he peaked at ninth in the world in 1952 , and was a top @-@ 20 player from shortly after his début and for the rest of the duration of his career . Miller 's bowling abilities led to even greater success . By the end of 1946 , he was already ranked sixth in the world and thereafter never slipped lower than ninth ; for much of his career , he was the second @-@ best bowler in the world according to the ratings , remarkably , for a 36 @-@ year @-@ old , peaking at the number 1 slot for a few months in 1956 . As an all @-@ rounder , therefore , it is unsurprising to find that he was peerless for most of his career , ranked as number one in the world for most of his career , including an unbroken eight @-@ year run from June 1948 until his retirement . 
 Miller 's statistics are an inexact measure of his worth to the side . Many of the Australia teams he played in featured very strong batting line @-@ ups , restricting his opportunities as a middle @-@ order player . His verve and enthusiasm were also important contributors to Australian success , as was his ability to produce the unexpected ( particularly with the ball ) and help break partnerships . It is for this reason that he is remembered for his personality and his one @-@ off feats , more than statistical accomplishment ; in Ian Chappell 's words " People who saw it still talk of Keith Miller 's monster shot that hit the Members Stand clock at the SCG in the 1950s " .

 GoldenEye ( 1995 ) is the seventeenth spy film in the James Bond series , and the first to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond . The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first film in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming . The story was conceived and written by Michael France , with later collaboration by other writers . In the film , Bond fights to prevent an ex @-@ MI6 agent , gone rogue , from using a satellite against London to cause global financial meltdown . 
 GoldenEye was released in 1995 after a six @-@ year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes , during which Timothy Dalton resigned from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Pierce Brosnan . M was also recast , with actress Judi Dench becoming the first woman to portray the character , replacing Robert Brown . The role of Miss Moneypenny was also recast , with Caroline Bliss being replaced by Samantha Bond and Desmond Llewelyn was the only actor to reprise the role of Q. GoldenEye was the first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War , which provided a background for the plot . 
 The film accumulated a worldwide gross of US $ 350 @.@ 7 million , considerably better than Dalton 's films , without taking inflation into account . The film received positive reviews , with critics viewing Brosnan as a definite improvement over his predecessor . The film also received award nominations for " Best Achievement in Special Effects " and " Best Sound " from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts . 
 The name " GoldenEye " pays homage to James Bond 's creator , Ian Fleming . While working for British Naval Intelligence as a lieutenant commander , Ian Fleming liaised with the American OSS to monitor developments in Spain after the Spanish Civil War in an operation codenamed Operation Goldeneye . Fleming used the name of his operation for his estate in Oracabessa , Jamaica . 
 = = Plot = = 
 MI6 agents James Bond and Alec Trevelyan infiltrate a Soviet chemical weapons facility in Arkhangelsk and plant explosives . Trevelyan is captured and shot by Colonel Arkady Ourumov , but Bond flees as the facility explodes . 
 Nine years later , in Monte Carlo Bond follows Xenia Onatopp , a member of the Janus crime syndicate , who has formed a suspicious relationship with a Royal Canadian Navy admiral . Onatopp kills the admiral by crushing his ribs with her thighs during sex , to allow now @-@ General Ourumov to steal his identity and use it to steal a Eurocopter Tiger helicopter . They fly it to a bunker in Severnaya , Siberia , where they massacre the staff and steal the control disk for GoldenEye , an electromagnetic Soviet weapon from the Cold War . They program the GoldenEye satellite to destroy the complex , and escape with programmer Boris Grishenko . Natalya Simonova , the lone survivor , contacts Grishenko and arranges to meet him in St. Petersburg , where he betrays her to Janus . 
 In London , M assigns Bond to investigate the attack . He flies to St. Petersburg to meet CIA officer Jack Wade . Jack suggests that Bond meet with Valentin Zukovsky , a former KGB agent and business rival of Janus . Zukovsky arranges a meeting between Bond and Janus . Onatopp meets Bond at the Grand Hotel Europe and attempts to kill him , but he overpowers her and she takes him to Janus . Bond meets Janus , who reveals himself as Trevelyan , who faked his death but was badly scarred from the explosion at Arkhangelsk . A descendant of the Cossack clans who collaborated with the Nazi forces in the Second World War , Trevelyan had vowed revenge against Britain after they betrayed the Cossacks , which drove his father to kill Trevelyan 's mother and himself . Just as Bond is about to shoot Trevelyan , Bond is shot with a tranquiliser dart . 
 Bond awakens , tied up with Natalya in the helicopter programmed to self @-@ destruct , but they escape . They are captured and brought to the military archives , where Russian Minister of Defence Dimitri Mishkin interrogates them . As Natalya reveals the existence of a second satellite and Ourumov 's involvement in the massacre in Siberia , Ourumov arrives and kills Mishkin , intending to frame Bond for the murder , then calls for his guards , but Bond escapes as a firefight ensues and Natalya is captured . Bond steals a tank and pursues Ourumov through St. Petersburg to Trevelyan 's train , where he kills Ourumov . Trevelyan escapes and locks Bond in the train with Natalya , setting it to self @-@ destruct . Bond cuts through the floor with his laser watch while Simonova locates Boris ' satellite dish in Cuba . The two escape just before the train explodes . 
 Bond and Natalya , now lovers , meet Jack in Cuba and borrow his aeroplane , but they are shot down while searching for GoldenEye 's satellite dish . Onatopp rappels down from a helicopter and attacks Bond . After a struggle , Bond shoots down the helicopter , which snares Onatopp and crushes her to death against a tree . Bond and Simonova watch a lake being drained of water , uncovering the satellite dish . They infiltrate the control station , where Bond is captured . Trevelyan reveals his plan to rob the Bank of England before erasing all of its financial records with GoldenEye , concealing the theft and destroying Britain 's economy . 
 Natalya programs the satellite to initiate atmospheric re @-@ entry and destroy itself . As Trevelyan captures Natalya and orders Grishenko to save the satellite , Grishenko triggers an explosion with Bond 's pen grenade ( received earlier from Q ) which allows Bond to escape to the antenna cradle . Bond then sabotages the antenna , preventing Grishenko from regaining control of the satellite . He and Trevelyan fight on the antenna 's suspended platform , which ends with Bond kicking Trevelyan off the platform and reflexively grabbing his foot . Bond releases Trevelyan and he falls to the bottom of the radio dish , where he is crushed by the falling cradle . Grishenko survives , but is immediately frozen and killed by liquid nitrogen . Natalya commandeers a helicopter and rescues Bond . It drops them in a field , where the couple is rescued by Jack and a team of Marines .

A poster for the then @-@ upcoming movie was even featured on the Carlton Hotel during the 1990 Cannes Film Festival . On August , The Sunday Times reported that producer Albert R. Broccoli had parted company with writer Richard Maibaum , who had worked on the scripts of all but three Bond films so far , and director John Glen , responsible for the previous five instalments of the series . Broccoli listed among the possible directors John Landis , Ted Kotcheff , and John <unk> . Broccoli 's stepson Michael G. Wilson contributed a script , and Wiseguy co @-@ producer Alfonse Ruggiero Jr. was hired to rewrite . Production was set to start in 1990 in Hong Kong for a release in late 1991 . 
 Dalton would declare in a 2010 interview that the script was ready and " we were talking directors " before the project entered development hell caused by legal problems between Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer , parent company of the series ' distributor United Artists , and Broccoli 's Danjaq , owners of the Bond film rights . In 1990 , as MGM / UA was purchased by French @-@ Italian broadcasting group Pathé , Pathé CEO Giancarlo <unk> intended to sell off the distribution rights of the studio 's catalogue so he could collect advance payments to finance the buyout . This included international broadcasting rights to the 007 library at cut @-@ rate prices , leading Danjaq to sue , alleging the licensing violated the Bond distribution agreements the company made with United Artists in 1962 , while negating Danjaq a share of the profits . The lawsuits were only settled in 1992 , while Dalton 's original contract with Danjaq expired in 1990 .

 In May 1993 , MGM announced a seventeenth James Bond film was back in the works , to be based on a screenplay by Michael France . With Broccoli 's health deteriorating ( he died seven months after the release of GoldenEye ) , his daughter Barbara Broccoli described him as taking " a bit of a back seat " in film 's production . Barbara and Michael G. Wilson took the lead roles in production while Albert Broccoli oversaw the production of GoldenEye as a consulting producer , credited as " presenter " . 
 In an interview in 1993 , Dalton said that Michael France was writing the screenplay , due to be completed in January or February 1994 . Despite France 's screenplay being completed by that January , in April 1994 Dalton officially resigned from the role . 
 After Michael France delivered the original screenplay , Jeffrey Caine was brought in to rewrite it . Caine kept many of France 's ideas but added the prologue prior to the credits . Kevin Wade polished the script and Bruce Feirstein added the finishing touches . In the film , the writing credit was shared by Caine and Feirstein , while France was credited with only the story , an arrangement he felt was unfair , particularly as he believed the additions made were not an improvement on his original version . Wade did not receive an official credit , but was acknowledged in the naming of Jack Wade , the CIA character he created . 
 To replace Dalton , the producers cast Irish actor Pierce Brosnan , who had been prevented from succeeding Roger Moore in 1986 because of his contract to star in the Remington Steele television series . Before negotiating with Brosnan , Mel Gibson and Liam Neeson passed on the role . Brosnan was paid $ 1 @.@ 2 million for the film , out of a total budget of $ 60 million . Judi Dench , an English actress , was cast as M replacing Robert Brown , making GoldenEye the first film of the series featuring a female M. The decision is widely believed to be inspired by Stella Rimington becoming head of MI5 in 1992 . John Woo was approached as the director , and turned down the opportunity , but said he was honoured by the offer . The producers then chose New Zealander Martin Campbell as the director . Brosnan later described Campbell as " warrior @-@ like in his take on the piece " and that " there was a huge passion there on both our parts " . 
 While the story was not based on a work by Ian Fleming , the title GoldenEye traces its origins to the name of Fleming 's Jamaican estate where he wrote the Bond novels . Fleming gave a number of origins for the name of his estate , including Carson McCullers ' Reflections in a Golden Eye and Operation Goldeneye , a contingency plan Fleming himself developed during World War II in case of a Nazi invasion through Spain . 
 Although only six years since the release of Licence to Kill , world politics had changed dramatically in the interim . GoldenEye was the first James Bond film to be produced since the fall of the Berlin Wall , the collapse of the Soviet Union , and the end of the Cold War , and therefore it was doubtful whether the character was still relevant in the modern world . Some in the film industry felt it would be " futile " for the Bond series to make a comeback , and that it was best left as " an icon of the past " . The producers even thought of new concepts for the series , such as a period piece set in the 1960s , a female 007 , or a Black James Bond . Ultimately , they chose to return to the basics of the series , not following the sensitive and caring Bond of the Dalton films or the political correctness that started to permeate the decade . However , when released , the film was viewed as a successful revitalisation , and it effectively adapted the series for the 1990s . One of GoldenEye 's innovations was the casting of a female M. In the film , the new M quickly establishes her authority , remarking that Bond is a " sexist , misogynist dinosaur " and a " relic of the Cold War " . This is an early indication that Bond is portrayed as far less tempestuous than Timothy Dalton 's Bond from 1989 . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography for the film began on 16 January 1995 and continued until 2 June . The producers were unable to film at Pinewood Studios , the usual location for Bond films , because it had been reserved for First Knight . Instead , an old Rolls @-@ Royce factory at Leavesden Aerodrome in Hertfordshire was converted into a new studio , dubbed Leavesden Studios . This process is shown on the 2006 DVD 's special features . Members of the production crew , duly impressed by the enormous size of the filmmaking complex they suddenly had to themselves , jokingly called Leavesden <unk> after Eon 's long serving producer Albert R. ' Cubby ' Broccoli . 
 The bungee jump was filmed at the Contra Dam ( also known as the <unk> or Locarno Dam ) in Ticino , Switzerland . The film 's casino scenes and the Tiger helicopter 's demonstration were shot in Monte Carlo . Reference footage for the tank chase was shot on location in St. Petersburg and matched to the studio at Leavesden . The climactic scenes on the satellite dish were shot at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico . The actual MI6 headquarters were used for external views of M 's office . Some of the scenes in St. Petersburg were actually shot in London – the Epsom Downs Racecourse doubled as the airport – to reduce expenses and security concerns , as the second unit sent to Russia required bodyguards . 
 The French Navy provided full use of the frigate FS La Fayette and their newest helicopter , the Eurocopter Tiger to the film 's production team . The French government also allowed the use of Navy logos as part of the promotional campaign for the film . However , the producers had a dispute with the French Ministry of Defence over Brosnan 's opposition to French nuclear weapons testing and his involvement with Greenpeace ; as a result , the French premiere of the film was cancelled . 
 The sequences involving the armoured train were filmed on the Nene Valley Railway , near Peterborough in the UK . The train was composed of a British Rail Class 20 diesel @-@ electric locomotive and a pair of BR Mk 1 coaches , all three heavily disguised to resemble a Soviet armoured train . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 GoldenEye was the last film of special effects supervisor Derek Meddings , to whom the film was dedicated . Meddings ' major contribution was miniatures . It was also the first Bond film to use computer generated imagery . Among the model effects are most external shots of Severnaya , the scene where Janus ' train crashes into the tank , and the lake which hides the satellite dish , since the producers could not find a round lake in Puerto Rico . The climax in the satellite dish used scenes in Arecibo , a model built by Meddings ' team and scenes shot with stuntmen in England . 
 Stunt car coordinator Rémy Julienne described the car chase between the Aston Martin DB5 and the Ferrari F355 as between " a perfectly shaped , old and vulnerable vehicle and a racecar . " The stunt had to be meticulously planned as the cars are vastly different . Nails had to be attached to the F355 tyres to make it skid , and during one take of the sliding vehicles , both cars collided . The largest stunt sequence in the film was the tank chase , which took around six weeks to film , partly on location in St. Petersburg and partly at Leavesden . A Russian T @-@ 54 / 55 tank , on loan from the East England Military Museum , was modified with the addition of fake explosive reactive armour panels . To avoid destroying the pavement on the city streets of St. Petersburg , the steel off @-@ road tracks of the T @-@ 54 / 55 were replaced with the rubber @-@ shoed tracks from a British Chieftain tank . The T @-@ 55 Tank used in the film is now on permanent display at Old Buckenham Airport where the East England Military Museum is based . 
 For the confrontation between Bond and Trevelyan inside the antenna cradle , director Campbell decided to take inspiration from Bond 's fight with Red Grant in From Russia with Love . Pierce Brosnan and Sean Bean did all the stunts themselves , except for one take where one is thrown against the wall . Brosnan injured his hand while filming the extending ladder sequence , making producers delay his scenes and film the ones in Severnaya earlier . 
 The opening 220 m ( 720 ft ) bungee jump at Archangel , shot at the <unk> Dam in Switzerland and performed by Wayne Michaels , was voted the best movie stunt of all time in a 2002 Sky Movies poll , and set a record for the highest bungee jump off a fixed structure . The ending of the pre @-@ credits sequence with Bond jumping after the aeroplane features Jacques ' Zoo ' <unk> riding the motorcycle to the edge and jumping , and B.J. Worth diving after the plane – which was a working aircraft , with Worth adding that part of the difficulty of the stunt was the kerosene flying on his face . 
 The fall of Communism in Russia is the main focus of the opening titles , designed by Daniel Kleinman ( who took over from Maurice Binder after his death in 1991 ) . They show the collapse and destruction of several structures associated with the Soviet Union , such as the red star , statues of Communist leaders — notably Joseph Stalin — and the hammer and sickle . In an interview , Kleinman said they were meant to be " a kind of story telling sequence " showing that " what was happening in Communist countries was Communism was falling down " . According to producer Michael G. Wilson , some Communist parties protested against " Socialist symbols being destroyed not by governments , but by bikini @-@ clad women " , especially certain Indian Communist parties , which threatened to boycott the film . 
 = = = Product placement = = = 
 GoldenEye was the first film bound by BMW 's three picture deal , so the producers were offered BMW 's latest roadster , the BMW Z3 . It was featured in the film months before its release , and a limited edition " 007 model " sold out within a day of being available to order . As part of the car 's marketing strategy , several Z3 's were used to drive journalists from a complimentary meal at the Rainbow Room restaurant to GoldenEye 's premiere at Radio City Music Hall . 
 For the film , a convertible Z3 is equipped with the usual Q refinements , including a self @-@ destruct feature and Stinger missiles behind the headlights . The Z3 does not have much screen time and none of the gadgets are used , which Martin Campbell attributed to the deal with BMW coming in the last stages of production . The Z3 's appearance in GoldenEye is thought to be the most successful promotion through product placement in 1995 . Ten years later , The Hollywood Reporter listed it as one of the most successful product placements in recent years . The article quoted Mary Lou Galician , head of media analysis and criticism at Arizona State University 's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication , as saying that the news coverage of Bond 's switch from Aston Martin to BMW " generated hundreds of millions of dollars of media exposure for the movie and all of its marketing partners . " 
 In addition , all computers in the film were provided by IBM , and in some scenes ( such as the pen grenade scene towards the end ) , the OS / 2 Warp splash screen can be seen on computer monitors . 
 A modified Omega <unk> Quartz Professional watch features as a major plot device several times in the film . It is shown to contain a remote detonator and a laser . This was the first time James Bond was shown to be wearing a watch by Omega , and the character has since worn Omega watches in every subsequent production . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The theme song , " GoldenEye " , was written by Bono and the Edge , and was performed by Tina Turner . As the producers did not collaborate with Bono or the Edge , the film score did not incorporate any of the theme song 's melodies , as was the case in previous James Bond films . Swedish group Ace of Base had also written a proposed theme song , but label Arista Records pulled the band out of the project fearing the negative impact in case the film flopped . The song was then re @-@ written as their single " The Juvenile " . 
 The soundtrack to GoldenEye was composed and performed by Éric Serra . Prolific Bond composer John Barry said that despite an offer by Barbara Broccoli , he turned it down . Serra 's score has been heavily criticised : Richard von <unk> , in Metro , wrote that it was " more appropriate for a ride on an elevator than a ride on a roller coaster " , and Filmtracks said Serra " failed completely in his attempt to tie Goldeneye to the franchise 's past . " The end credits song , Serra 's " The Experience of Love " , was based on a short cue Serra had originally written for Luc Besson 's Léon one year earlier . 
 Later John Altman provided the music for the tank chase in St. Petersburg . Serra 's original track for that sequence can still be found on the soundtrack as " A Pleasant Drive in St. Petersburg " . Serra composed and performed a number of synthesiser tracks , including the version of the James Bond Theme that plays during the gun barrel sequence , while Altman and David Arch provided the more traditional symphonic music .

 GoldenEye premiered on 13 November 1995 , at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City , and went on general release in the USA on 17 November 1995 . The UK premiere , attended by Prince Charles , followed on 22 November at the Odeon Leicester Square , with general release two days later . Brosnan boycotted the French premiere to support Greenpeace 's protest against the French nuclear testing program . 
 The film earned over $ 26 million during its opening across 2 @,@ 667 cinemas in the USA . Its worldwide sales were around the equivalent of $ 350 million . It had the fourth @-@ highest worldwide gross of all films in 1995 and was the most successful Bond film since Moonraker , taking inflation into account . 
 GoldenEye was edited to be guaranteed a PG @-@ 13 rating from the MPAA and a 12 rating from the BBFC . The cuts included the visible bullet impact to Trevelyan 's head when he is shot in the prologue , several additional deaths during the sequence in which Onatopp guns down the workers at the Severnaya station , more explicit footage and violent behaviour in the Admiral 's death , extra footage of Onatopp 's death , and Bond giving her a rabbit punch in the car . In 2006 , the film was re @-@ mastered and re @-@ edited for the James Bond Ultimate Edition DVD in which the BBFC cuts were restored , causing the rating to be changed to 15 . However , the original MPAA edits still remain . 
 = = = Reviews = = = 
 The critical reception of the film was mostly positive . Film review collection website Rotten Tomatoes holds it at a 78 % approval rating , while a similar site , Metacritic , holds it at 65 % . In the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4 , and said Brosnan 's Bond was " somehow more sensitive , more vulnerable , more psychologically complete " than the previous ones , also commenting on Bond 's " loss of innocence " since previous films . James Berardinelli described Brosnan as " a decided improvement over his immediate predecessor " with a " flair for wit to go along with his natural charm " , but added that " fully one @-@ quarter of Goldeneye is momentum @-@ killing padding . " 
 Several reviewers lauded M 's appraisal of Bond as a " sexist , misogynist dinosaur " , with Todd McCarthy in Variety saying GoldenEye " breathes fresh creative and commercial life " into the series . John Puccio of DVD Town said that GoldenEye was " an eye and ear @-@ pleasing , action @-@ packed entry in the Bond series " and that the film gave Bond " a bit of humanity , too " . Ian Nathan of Empire said that GoldenEye " revamps that indomitable British spirit " and that the Die Hard movies " don 't even come close to 007 " . Tom Sonne of the Sunday Times considered GoldenEye the best Bond film since The Spy Who Loved Me . Jose Arroyo of Sight & Sound considered the greatest success of the film was in modernising the series . 
 GoldenEye was also ranked high in Bond @-@ related lists . IGN chose it as the fifth @-@ best movie , while Entertainment Weekly ranked it eighth , and Norman Wilner of MSN as ninth . ET also voted Xenia Onatopp as the sixth @-@ most memorable Bond Girl , while IGN ranked Natalya as seventh in a similar list . 
 However , the film received several negative reviews . Richard Schickel of Time wrote that after " a third of a century 's hard use " , Bond 's conventions survived on " wobbly knees " , while in Entertainment Weekly , Owen Gleiberman thought the series had " entered a near @-@ terminal state of exhaustion . " Dragan <unk> said that GoldenEye had a predictable series of scenes , and Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said that the film was " a middle @-@ aged entity anxious to appear trendy at all costs " . David <unk> of Premiere wrote that " the trademark humour is in short supply " and that " Goldeneye isn 't classic Bond by any stretch of the imagination . " Madeleine Williams said that " there are plenty of stunts and explosions to take your mind off the plot . "

 GoldenEye was the second and final Bond film to be adapted to a novel by novelist John Gardner . The book closely follows the film 's storyline , but Gardner added a violent sequence prior to the opening bungee jump in which Bond kills a group of Russian guards , a change that the video game GoldenEye 007 retained . 
 In late 1995 , Topps Comics began publishing a three @-@ issue comic book adaptation of GoldenEye . The script was adapted by Don McGregor with art by Rick Magyar . The first issue carried a January 1996 cover date . For unknown reasons , Topps cancelled the entire adaptation after the first issue had been published , and to date the adaptation has never been released in its entirety . 
 The film was the basis for GoldenEye 007 , a video game for the Nintendo 64 developed by Rare ( known at the time as Rareware ) and published by Nintendo . The game was praised by critics and in January 2000 , readers of the British video game magazine Computer and Video Games listed GoldenEye 007 in first place in a list of " the hundred greatest video games " . In Edge 's 10th anniversary issue in 2003 , the game was included as one of their top ten shooters of all time . It is based upon the film , but many of the missions were extended or modified . 
 GoldenEye 007 was modified into a racing game intended to be released for the Virtual Boy console . However , the game was cancelled before release . In 2004 , Electronic Arts released GoldenEye : Rogue Agent , the first game of the James Bond series in which the player does not take on the role of Bond . Instead , the protagonist is an aspiring Double @-@ 0 agent Jonathan Hunter , known by his codename " GoldenEye " recruited by a villain of the Bond universe , Auric Goldfinger . Except for the appearance of Xenia Onatopp , the game was unrelated to the film , and was released to mediocre reviews . It was excoriated by several critics including Eric Qualls for using the name " GoldenEye " as an attempt to ride on the success of Rare 's game . In 2010 , an independent development team released GoldenEye : Source , a multiplayer only total conversion mod developed using Valve 's Source engine . 
 Nintendo announced a remake of the original GoldenEye 007 game at their E3 press conference on 15 June 2010 . The game is a modernised retelling of the original movie 's story , with Daniel Craig playing the role of Bond . Bruce Feirstein returned to write a modernised version of the script , while Nicole Scherzinger covered Tina Turner 's theme song . The game was developed by Eurocom and published by Activision for the Wii and Nintendo DS and was released in November 2010 . Both Wii and DS versions bear little to no resemblance to the locations and weapons of the original N64 release . In 2011 the game was ported to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 under the name GoldenEye 007 : Reloaded . 
 = Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton = 
 Joint a Tribal Council , of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton , 528 F.2d 370 ( 1st Cir . 1975 ) , was a landmark decision regarding aboriginal title in the United States . The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that the Nonintercourse Act applied to the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot , non @-@ federally @-@ recognized Indian tribes , and established a trust relationship between those tribes and the federal government that the state of Maine could not terminate . 
 By upholding a declaratory judgement of the United States District Court for the District of Maine , the First Circuit cleared the way for the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot to oblige the federal government to bring a land claim on their behalf for approximately 60 % of Maine , an area populated by 350 @,@ 000 non @-@ Indians . According to the Department of Justice , the suit was " potentially the most complex litigation ever brought in the federal courts with social and economic impacts without precedent and incredible potential litigation costs to all parties . " The decision led to the passage of the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act in 1980 , allocating $ 81 @.@ 5 million for the benefit of the tribes , in part to allow them to purchase lands in Maine , and extinguishing all aboriginal title in Maine . The settlement was reached " after more than a decade of enormously complex litigation and negotiation . " 
 The Passamaquoddy claim was " one of the first of a series of eastern Indian land claims to be prosecuted " and " the first successful suit for the return of any significant amount of land . " Compared to the $ 81 @.@ 5 million compensation in the Passamaquoddy case , the financial compensation of other Indian Land Claims Settlements has been " inconsequential . "

 Indigenous populations have been present in modern @-@ day Maine for 11 @,@ 000 years , with year @-@ round occupation for 6 @,@ 000 years . Burial sites associated with an Algonquian @-@ speaking culture date back 5 @,@ 000 years . The Wabanaki Confederacy , which included the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot tribes , also pre @-@ dates European contact in the region . The Passamaquoddy may have had contact with Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524 , but their first extended contact with Europeans would have been with a short @-@ lived settlement built on <unk> Island by Samuel de Champlain and Pierre Dugua , Sieur de Mons in 1604 – 1605 . Research by Emerson Baker in 1989 uncovered over 70 extant deeds documenting private purchases of land from indigenous peoples by English @-@ speaking settlers , the earliest dating to 1639 . But , most Passamaquoddy lands " remained beyond the reach of English settlers " until the mid @-@ 18th century . 
 A few years prior to the end of the French and Indian Wars in 1763 , the Province of Massachusetts Bay had taken possession of all Penobscot land " below the head of the tide " of the Penobscot River ( near present @-@ day Bangor ) . During the Revolutionary War , both the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy , having been solicited by Superintendent John Allan , were allied with the colonies and fought against the British . After the war , Allan urged the Continental Congress to follow through on various promises made to the tribes ; Congress took no action and revoked Allan 's appointment . 
 In 1794 , Allan — now as Commissioner for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts — negotiated a treaty with the Passamaquoddy that alienated most of the aboriginal lands at issue in the later litigation . The treaty reserved 23 @,@ 000 acres ( 93 km2 ) for the tribe . In 1796 , the Penobscot ceded 200 @,@ 000 acres ( 810 km2 ) in the Penobscot River basin . In 1818 , the Penobscot ceded all their remaining land , save some islands in the Penobscot River and four six @-@ mile @-@ square townships . Maine gained statehood in 1820 and assumed Massachusetts ' obligations under these treaties . The " final big grab " happened in 1833 , when Maine purchased the four townships , relegating the Penobscot to Indian Island . None of the land cessions occurred pursuant to a federally ratified treaty . According to Kempers : 
 Since the beginning of this country 's history , most American Indian tribes have been subject to federal authority and jurisdiction . In Maine , however , indigenous populations lived on reservations that were exclusively and completely administered by the state . This unique arrangement shaped tribal life in Maine , and proved to be a crucial issue in the development and resolution of the tribe 's land claim . 
 In the late 19th century , the Maine Supreme Court had held that the Passamaquoddy were not a tribe and had no aboriginal rights . 
 = = = The dispute = = = 
 In the 1950s , the Penobscot Nation had hired a lawyer to research the possibility of a land claim . In light of the Eisenhower administration 's Indian termination policy , counsel opined that " obtaining a fair hearing of their claim would be virtually impossible . " Up until the 1960s , Maine continued to fulfill certain provisions of the 1794 treaty , including the periodic provision of 150 yards of blue cloth , 400 pounds of powder , 100 bushels of salt , 36 hats , and a barrel of rum . By 1964 , of the 23 @,@ 000 acres ( 93 km2 ) reservation , 6 @,@ 000 acres ( 24 km2 ) had been diverted to other purposes and only 17 @,@ 000 acres ( 69 km2 ) remained under tribal control . 
 In February 1964 , the tribal council of the Passamaquoddy Indian Township Reservation requested a meeting with Maine 's governor and attorney general to discuss a land dispute related to construction by non @-@ Indians on lands claimed by the tribe . The Passamaquoddy representatives were kept waiting for 5 hours after their scheduled meeting time with the governor , and the attorney general " smiled and wished them well if they ever took their claim to court . " Soon after the meeting , pursuant to a vote of the Passamaquoddy tribal council , 75 members protested against the construction project along Route 1 , resulting in 10 arrests . Charged with disorderly conduct and trespassing , they hired attorney Don Gellers to defend them . While these charges were still pending , Gellers began to prepare a land claim on behalf of the tribe . 
 = = = Attorneys = = = 
 Gellers ' theory was that Maine had violated the 1794 treaty by selling 6 @,@ 000 acres ( 24 km2 ) of land . Because Maine had made no provision for a waiver of its sovereign immunity ( for example , in a state claims court ) , Gellers ' strategy was to sue Massachusetts , hoping that Massachusetts would in turn sue Maine . On March 8 , 1968 , Gellers — affiliating with Massachusetts attorney John Bottomly — filed a suit in Suffolk Superior Court in Boston , seeking $ 150 million in damages . This initial claim involved land in and around the Indian Township Reservation . Three days later , Maine narcotics officers raided Gellers ' home and arrested him for possession of marijuana . Gellers was eventually convicted and , on bail , fled to Israel ; the lawsuit that he started was never prosecuted . 
 Gellers was representing the Passamaquoddy pursuant to a 10 % contingency fee agreement . Gellers , in turn , had assigned 40 % of his fee to Bottomly . As the negotiations of the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act were reaching a close in May 1978 , even though neither Gellers nor Bottomly had performed any further work for the tribes , Bottomly filed suit in the District of Maine claiming he was entitled to a portion of any eventual settlement . On October 10 , Judge Gignoux dismissed Bottomly 's suit on the grounds of tribal sovereign immunity . When Bottomly 's appeal came before the First Circuit in 1979 , Maine filed an amicus brief arguing that the tribe was entitled to no such immunity . The First Circuit rejected this argument . A similar suit by Gellers — who had since been disbarred and changed his name to Tuvia Ben Shmuel Yosef — was thrown out in 1989 . 
 Tom Tureen — who had worked as a summer law clerk for Gellers in the summer of 1967 — joined the Indian Legal Services Unit of Pine Tree Legal Services ( funded by the Office of Economic Opportunity to provide legal services to indigent clients ) after his graduation in June 1969 . For the remainder of the year , Tureen assisted Passamaquoddy members in " petty disputes " such as divorce and bill collection . In early 1970 , Tureen began assisting the tribe in an effort to receive federal grants . In 1971 , Tureen co @-@ wrote an article with Francis J. O 'Toole , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the Maine Law Review , arguing that Maine 's tribes should fall under federal , not state , jurisdiction . O 'Toole and Tureen noted that : " There is no evidence that the treaty was 1794 was made in compliance with the Non @-@ Intercourse Act . " 
 The Passamaquoddy tribal council fired Gellers and asked Tureen to take over . Fearing that his federally funded legal aid employer could not withstand the political pressure that the suit would inevitably provoke , in 1971 , Tureen asked the Native American Rights Fund ( NARF ) to act as co @-@ counsel . Tureen himself would eventually move to NARF during the course of the litigation . Tureen attempted to persuade a large law firm to join the case pro bono . Among those who turned him down were Arthur Lazarus , Jr. of Frank , Harris , Shriver & Kampelman , who had litigated many claims in front of the Indian Claims Commission . Based on the acreage involved , Lazarus pointed out that the claim would net only $ 300 @,@ 000 before the Commission , which would be less than the cost of litigation . When Tureen said , " Mr. Lazarus , this is not an Indian Claims Commission case , this is a Nonintercourse Act claim , " Lazarus shook his head and told Tureen he was dreaming . Tureen was able to recruit Barry Margolin , David Crosby , and Stuart Ross of Hogan & Hartson . The other members of the team were Robert <unk> of NARF and Robert <unk> of Pine Tree Legal Assistance . 
 = = = Prelude and petition = = = 
 Tureen was critical of Gellers ' strategy because it required suing in state court ( which he believed would be biased against any such claim ) , because it limited the claim to the 6 @,@ 000 acres ( 24 km2 ) promised by the 1794 treaty , and because it would leave the tribes under state jurisdiction and ineligible for federal benefits . One theory that Tureen considered in order to overcome Maine 's sovereign immunity was to rely on United States v. Lee ( 1882 ) , which had permitted a land claim by the heirs of Robert E. Lee against the federal government . Tureen also feared that a federal court would find that it lacked subject @-@ matter jurisdiction for an ejectment action due to the well @-@ pleaded complaint rule , although the Supreme Court held otherwise in Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida ( 1974 ) — decided three years after the Passamaquoddy complaint was filed . Tureen also worried about the delay @-@ related defenses of laches , adverse possession , and statute of limitations . 
 Tureen 's team discovered the six @-@ year federal statute of limitations for actions by the federal government for money damages related to Indian lands , 28 U.S.C. § <unk> ( b ) — which treated prior claims as arising on the date of its passage , July 18 , 1966 — a mere eighteen months before the it was due to expire on July 18 , 1972 . Although Tureen 's team had come up with alternate theories to overcome Maine 's sovereign immunity , the well @-@ pleaded complaint rule , and delay @-@ based defenses , it was " clearly established " that none of those weaknesses would apply to a Nonintercourse Act suit by the federal government . 
 Tureen recommended that the tribe argue that the entire treaty was void and ask the federal government to seek possession of the entire 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 @,@ 000 km2 ) on their behalf . The Passamaquoddy tribal council unanimously approved Tureen 's strategy . The Passamaquoddy also had grievances about the management of the tribal trust fund , tribal hunting and fishing rights , and the disfranchisement of tribal members from 1924 to 1967 . Later , in April , Tureen was approached by the Penobscot whose land claim concerned 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 km2 ) . 
 On February 22 , 1972 , the governors of the Passamaquoddy tribes at Indian Township and Pleasant Point wrote a letter to Louis R. Bruce , the Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs , asking him to initiate such a lawsuit before the July 18th deadline . In early March , Bruce sent a letter to the Department of the Interior recommending that the tribes ' request be granted . No reply was forthcoming before April 1 . Tureen met with William <unk> , the Associate Solicitor for Indian Affairs , who said more time was needed . On mid @-@ May , Tureen persuaded Governor Kenneth Curtis to issue a public statement saying that the Passamaquoddy deserved their date in court . Senators Margaret Chase Smith ( R @-@ ME ) and Edmund S. Muskie ( D @-@ ME ) and Representatives William Hathaway ( D @-@ ME ) and Peter <unk> ( D @-@ ME ) also issued similar statements of support . 
 <unk> advised Interior to take no action , noting that " no court had ever ordered the federal government to file a lawsuit on behalf of anyone , much less a multi @-@ million dollar lawsuit on behalf of a powerless and virtually penniless Indian tribe . " While Tureen and his colleagues agreed that a court would be hesitant to order such litigation due to the doctrine of prosecutorial discretion , they believed that , in light of the impending statute of limitations , a court might order the federal government to simply file the lawsuit as an exercise of the court 's common law power to preserve its jurisdiction . 
 = = District of Maine decision = = 
 The tribes ' complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maine on June 2 , 1972 . The tribes asked for a declaratory judgment and a preliminary injunction requiring the Interior Department to file suit for $ 25 billion in damages and 12 @.@ 5 acres ( 51 @,@ 000 m2 ) of land . Tureen 's appearance before Judge Edward Thaxter Gignoux — two weeks after filing the complaint , at the first of two hearings — was his first ever appearance in court . Tureen relied on a provision of the Administrative Procedure Act , 5 U.S.C. § 706 ( 1 ) , which permits a review court to " compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed . " Justice Department lawyer Dennis Wittman represented the Secretary . Judge Gignoux gave the Secretary one week to either voluntarily file the suit or report its reasons for not doing so to him . 
 At the second hearing , on June 23 , the Secretary took the position that the Nonintercourse Act did apply to the Maine ( and the original states ) , but that it only applied to federally recognized tribes . The Secretary also argued that filing a lawsuit would damage relations between the federal government and the state of Maine . When Judge Gignoux pointed out that Maine 's governor and entire Congressional delegation had called on the Secretary to bring suit , U.S. Attorney for Maine Peter Mills ( who was with Wittman at the counsel 's table ) declared that " he , too , wanted the government to bring suit " — causing laughter in the courtroom . After a recess , Judge Gignoux issued a preliminary order requiring the Secretary to file the lawsuit . 
 The Secretary filed a suit — United States v. Maine — for $ 150 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in damages on behalf of the Passamaquoddy on July 1 , 1972 . The Penobscot Tribe voted to join the lawsuit late June , and the Secretary filed a second lawsuit , for the same amount , on behalf of the Penobscot on July 17 — one day before the statute of limitations would have expired . A few hours before the statutory period was due to expire the next day , Congress extended it for 90 days — the first of a series of such extensions . United States v. Maine was stayed , pending the resolution of Passamaquoddy v. Morton . Further , proceedings in the district court were put on hold until the First Circuit dismissed the Secretary 's interlocutory appeal from Judge Gignoux 's preliminary order in 1973 . 
 The tribe amended their complaint , abandoning their request for injunctive relief and instead asking only for a declaratory judgment . Judge Gignoux allowed the state of Maine to intervene . 
 Judge Gignoux 's ruling was issued on January 20 , 1975 , eighteen months after the oral arguments concluded . Judge Gignoux ruled in the tribe 's favor on the first two questions , and thus did not reach the third : 
 whether the Nonintercourse Act applies to the Passamaquoddy Tribe ; 
 whether the Act establishes a trust relationship between the United States and the Tribe ; 
 whether the United States may deny plaintiffs ' request for litigation on the sole ground that there is no trust relationship 
 = = First Circuit opinion = = 
 The defendants appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit . On December 23 , 1973 , Judge Levin H. Campbell , for the unanimous panel , affirmed . Because the trust relationship was found , the First Circuit did not reach the third issue . 
 = = = Applicability of Nonintercourse Act = = = 
 The First Circuit held that the plain meaning of the Act applied to " any tribe , " whether federally recognized or not : 
 Congress is not prevented from legislating as to tribes generally ; and this appears to be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act . There is nothing in the Act to suggest that ‘ tribe ’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized . Nor , as the district court found , is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants ' interpretation . Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act . 
 The Circuit acknowledged that its holding had great relevance to the tribe 's ultimate land claim : 
 Before turning to the district court 's rulings , we must acknowledge a certain awkwardness in deciding whether the Act encompasses the Tribe without considering at the same time whether the Act encompasses the controverted land transactions with Maine . Whether the Tribe is a tribe within the Act would best be decided , under ordinary circumstances , along with the Tribe 's specific land claims , for the Act only speaks of tribes in the context of their land dealings . 
 However , the Circuit did not wish to foreclose the result of that potential future lawsuit : 
 [ W ] e are not to be deemed as settling , by implication or otherwise , whether the Act affords relief from , or even extends to , the Tribe 's land transactions with Maine . When and if the specific transactions are litigated , new facts and legal and equitable considerations may well appear , and Maine should be free in any such future litigation to defend broadly , even to the extent of arguing positions and theories which overlap considerably those treated here . 
 = = = Existence of trust relationship = = = 
 Campbell acknowledged that federal dealings with the Passamaquoddy had been sparse : 
 [ T ] he federal government 's dealings with the Tribe have been few . It has never , since 1789 , entered into a treaty with the Tribe , nor has Congress ever enacted any legislation mentioning the Tribe . 
 However , the Circuit held that the Nonintercourse Act alone was sufficient to create the trust relationship , even in the absence of federal recognition or a treaty : 
 [ T ] he Nonintercourse Act imposes upon the federal government a fiduciary 's role with respect to protection of the lands of a tribe covered by the Act seems to us beyond question , both from the history , wording and structure of the Act and from the cases cited above and in the district court 's opinion . The purpose of the Act has been held to acknowledge and guarantee the Indian tribes ' right of occupancy . . . and clearly there can be no meaningful guarantee without a corresponding federal duty to investigate and take such action as may be warranted in the circumstances . 
 Having found that the trust relationship existed , the Circuit rejected the remainder of Maine 's arguments on the grounds that " Congress alone has the right to determine when its guardianship shall cease . " However , the Circuit noted that " we do not foreclose later consideration of whether Congress or the Tribe should be deemed in some manner to have acquiesced in , or Congress to have ratified , the Tribe 's land transactions with Maine . "

 The defendants did not appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court , and the time for filing such an appeal lapsed on March 22 , 1976 . After Judge Gignoux 's decision became final , the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot gained federal recognition in 1976 , thus becoming eligible for $ 5 million / year in housing , education , health care , and other social services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs . Further , the Interior Department 's Solicitors Office began looking into whether and how it should proceed in United States v. Maine . 
 Afterward , Tom Tureen ( the tribes ' lawyer ) tried to negotiate a cash settlement . At first Maine 's governor , James B. Longley , Maine 's attorney general , Joseph Brennan , and the Great Northern <unk> Corporation , the largest landowner in the state , were unwilling to discuss a settlement . With no one to negotiate with , Tureen devoted his energy to assisting the Solicitors Office in researching the legal and historical basis of the claim . 
 In September 1976 , Boston law firm Ropes & Gray opined that the state 's $ 27 million municipal bond issue could not go forward using property within the claim area as collateral . On September 29 , Governor Longley flew to Washington , and Maine 's <unk> introduced legislation directing the federal courts not to hear the tribe 's claim ; Congress adjourned before the bills could be considered . 
 Bradley H. Patterson , Jr . , a member of the Ford administration , evaluated the tribe 's claim and concluded that " Maine 's tribes stood to gain a sizeable portion of that state " if the federal government went forward and litigated the dispute on behalf of the tribe , to which the court had declared the tribe was entitled . Patterson evaluated various other options , and recommended a land and cash settlement ; however , in December 1976 , Ford decided to pass this issue to the next administration : that of President Jimmy Carter . 
 = = = Interior memo = = = 
 On January 11 , 1977 , prior to Carter 's inauguration , the Interior Department sent the Justice Department a litigation report on the merits of the claim , recommending that ejectment be sought against the landowners in the 1 @,@ 250 @,@ 000 acres ( 5 @,@ 100 km2 ) claim area populated by 350 @,@ 000 people . In response , Governor Longley called on the tribes to limit their claim to the value of the land as of 1796 , without interest ( the valuation method used in Indian Claims Commission cases ) , and called on Congress to pass legislation forcing the tribes to so limit their claim . Interior 's memo reached Peter Taft — the grandson of President Taft , and the head of the Justice Department 's Land and Natural Resources Division — who wrote to Judge Gignoux , declaring his intention to litigate test cases concerning 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 – 8 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 – 32 @,@ 000 km2 ) of forests ( mostly owned by large forestry companies ) within the claim area on June 1 , unless a settlement was reached . 
 On March 1 , 1977 , the Maine delegation introduced bills to extinguish all aboriginal title in Maine without compensation . Senator James <unk> ( D @-@ SD ) , the Chairman of the Senate 's Indian Affairs Committee , denounced the legislation as " one @-@ sided " and declined to hold hearings . 
 = = = First task force = = = 
 Soon after , Carter created a special White House task force to investigate the claims . Carter named retiring judge William B. Gunter , of the state Supreme Court of Georgia , to mediate the dispute . Archibald Cox — a professor at Harvard and the former Watergate special prosecutor — joined the tribes ' legal team pro bono . In response , Governor Longley hired Edward Bennett Williams , the named partner of Williams & Connolly , to represent the state . Three months of presentations to Judge Gunter ensued . 
 On July 15 , 1977 , in a four @-@ page memorandum to President Carter , Gunter announced his proposed solution : $ 25 million from the federal treasury , 100 @,@ 000 acres ( 400 km2 ) from the disputed area to be assembled by the state and conveyed to the federal government in trust ( 20 % of the state 's holdings within the claim area ) , and the option to purchase 400 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 600 km2 ) at fair market value as negotiated by the Interior Secretary . If the tribes rejected the settlement , Gunter proposed that Congress extinguish all aboriginal title to privately held lands ( more than 95 % of the claim area ) , and allow the tribes to litigate their claims only to 5 @,@ 000 acres ( 20 km2 ) owned by the state of Maine . 
 = = = Second task force = = = 
 Both the tribes and the state rejected Gunter 's solution . In October 1977 , Carter appointed a new three @-@ member task force ( the " White House Work Group " ) , consisting of Eliot Cutler , a former legislative assistant to Senator Muskie and staffer at OMB , Leo M. Krulitz , the Interior Solicitor , and A. Stevens Clay , a partner at Judge Gunter 's law firm . Over a period of months , the task force facilitated negotiations over a settlement that would include portions of cash , land , and BIA services . A memorandum of understanding was signed in early February 1978 . 
 The memorandum called for 300 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 200 km2 ) , with the additional land coming from the paper and timber companies , and a $ 25 million trust fund for the tribes . In return , the tribes would agree to the extinguishment of their aboriginal title as against all titleholders with 50 @,@ 000 acres ( 200 km2 ) or less ; this would have cleared title to more than 9 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 36 @,@ 000 km2 ) , leaving only the tribe 's claims against the state and fourteen private landowners such as the Great Northern <unk> Paper Corporation , the International Paper Company , the Boise Cascade Corporation , the Georgia @-@ Pacific Corporation , the Diamond International Corporation , the Scott Paper Company , and the St. Regis Paper Company . Further , the tribes would agree to dismiss their claims against the state for $ 1 @.@ 7 million in appropriations per year for 15 years and all claims against the private landowners for 300 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 200 km2 ) and an option to buy 200 @,@ 000 acres ( 810 km2 ) more at fair market value . Congress was to appropriate $ 1 @.@ 5 million to compensate the contributing private landowners and $ 3 @.@ 5 million to assist the tribes in exercising the option . 
 = = = Final negotiations = = = 
 On April 26 , Governor Longley and Attorney General Brennan finally sat down with Tureen and the tribal negotiating committee . Negotiations broke down over the issue of state taxation as well as civil and criminal jurisdiction . In response , in June , Attorney General Griffin Bell threatened to commence the first phase of the litigation against the state for 350 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 400 km2 ) and $ 300 million . In August , however , Bell informed Judge Gignoux that he would not proceed against the fourteen large private landowners . And , in September , Bell asked for a six @-@ month delay before prosecuting the claim against the state . Meanwhile , Representative William Cohen ( R @-@ ME ) was running against Senator William Hathaway ( D @-@ ME ) — the tribe 's main ally in Congress — in the 1978 election with TV advertisements criticizing Hathaway 's role in the land claim . After the public announcement of a new plan negotiated by Hathaway , Cohen defeated Hathaway in a landslide , while Brennan replaced Longley in the gubernatorial election . 
 Although the tribes made progress in implementing the Hathaway plans with the paper and timber companies , Krulitz ceased to support the proposal when the full extent of the required federal appropriations became clear . Krulitz was replaced with Eric Jankel — assistant for intergovernmental affairs to Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus — with whom Tureen had previously negotiated the settlement to the Narragansett land claim in Rhode Island . Tureen and Jankel — along with Donald Perkins , a lawyer for the paper and timber companies — negotiated a solution whereby $ 30 million of the settlement funds would come from various programs in the federal budget . That settlement was presented to the Maine congressional delegation in August 1979 , but they refusal to endorse it until the Maine legislature had approved it . Governor Langley , in turn , refused to accept any deal that would limit the state 's jurisdiction over the tribes . 
 Several legal developments occurred on the eve of the settlement . First , the First Circuit held in Bottomly v. Passamaquoddy Tribe ( 1979 ) that the Passamaquoddy were entitled to tribal sovereign immunity ( see supra ) . Second , the Maine Supreme Judicial Court held in State v. Dana ( 1979 ) that the state had no jurisdiction to punish on @-@ reservation arson because of the federal Major Crimes Act . Third , in Wilson v. Omaha Indian Tribe ( 1979 ) , the U.S. Supreme Court held that the provision of the Nonintercourse Act placing the burden of proof in land claims on non @-@ Indians did not apply to U.S. state defendants ( but did apply to corporate defendants ) ; further , language in Wilson threatened to confine the applicability of the Act to Indian country . The tribes persuaded the U.S. Solicitor General to file a motion asking the Court to delete that language from its opinion . The Court denied the motion . Maine unsuccessfully sought certiorari in Dana on the basis of Wilson . 
 = = = Maine Implementing Act = = = 
 Maine 's new attorney general , Richard S. Cohen ( no relation to the senator ) took over negotiations for the state ; soon , each side made new concessions . In March 1980 , draft legislation was approved by the tribes ' joint negotiating committee and ratified by an advisory referendum of the tribes ' membership . This vote also permitted the inclusion of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians in the settlement . The Maine state legislature passed the Maine Implementing Act ( MIA ) , a statute enabling the settlement , on April 3 , 1980 . 
 = = Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act = = 
 Several political changes preceded the passage of the settlement act . First , Senator Edmund Muskie ( D @-@ ME ) — who previously seemed supportive of a settlement , but was gaining national prominence on the issue of fiscal responsibility prior to the 1980 Democratic primary — gave up his seat as Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to accept President Carter 's nomination for Secretary of State . Second , Governor Brennan 's choice to replace Muskie ( and thus inherit his predecessor 's committee assignments ) was George Mitchell ( D @-@ ME ) — who had supported the land claim as U.S. Attorney and possessed legal gravitas due to his tenure as a District Judge . Another factor affecting the final push for the settlement was the fear that , if Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election , he would veto any settlement favorable toward the tribes . 
 On June 12 , 1980 , Senators Mitchell and William Cohen ( R @-@ ME ) introduced the settlement act in the Senate . The House passed the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act ( MICSA ) on September 22 , the Senate on September 23 , and President Carter signed it on October 10 . The appropriation bill funding the settlement was approved on December 12 . 
 MICSA extinguished all aboriginal title in Maine . In return , the Act allocated $ 81 @.@ 5 million . $ 27 million was placed in trust for the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot tribes , and the remaining $ 55 million was allocated towards the tribes ' purchase of up to 300 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 200 km2 ) of land . The land acquisition funds were divided such : $ 900 @,@ 000 for the Houlton Maliseet ; $ 26 @.@ 8 million for the Passamaquoddy ; and $ 26 @.@ 8 million for the Penobscot . Further , the Houlton Maliseet gained federal recognition ( which the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot had possessed since 1976 ) . Altogether , the Passamaquoddy , Penobscot , and Houlton tribes " received the equivalent of $ 25 @,@ 000 and 275 acres per capita . " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 As of August 1982 , the Passamaquoddy had acquired approximately 40 @,@ 000 acres ( 160 km2 ) and the Penobscots approximately 150 @,@ 000 acres ( 610 km2 ) . As of January 1987 , the Passamaquoddy had acquired 115 @,@ 000 acres ( 470 km2 ) ; the Penobscot , 143 @,@ 685 acres ( 581 @.@ 47 km2 ) ( not including the 4 @,@ 841 acres ( 19 @.@ 59 km2 ) reservation ) ; and the Houlton had not yet acquired any . MICSA was subsequently amended to provide additional compensation to the Houlton and the Aroostook Band of <unk> . 
 The settlement acts created " unique jurisdictional relationships between the State of Maine and the tribes . " MICSA provided that the " Passamaquoddy Tribe , the Penobscot Nation , and their members , and the land and natural resources owned by , or held in trust [ for them ] . . . shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Maine to the extent and in the manner provided in the Maine Implementing Act . . . . ” MIA provided that the tribes and their lands " shall be subject to the laws of the State and to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the State to the same extent as any other person . . . or natural resources therein . " Outside of Maine , the federal government and tribal governments generally share concurrent civil and criminal jurisdiction in Indian country , and the state governments possess no jurisdiction unless granted by Congress . 
 The First Circuit has interpreted the settlement acts to limit the authority of the Maine tribes relative to other federally recognized tribes . Under the settlement acts , federal law governs only " internal tribal matters . " Lawyer Nicole <unk> argues that the " narrow interpretation of those statutes makes it difficult for tribal governments to serve and protect their peoples , lands , and culture " and that the result is incompatible with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . 
 = = As a precedent = = 
 The Passamaquoddy decision is binding only in the First Circuit , which includes the U.S. states of Maine , New Hampshire , Massachusetts , and Rhode Island , and the settlement act extinguished any further aboriginal title litigation in Maine . The Narragansetts were an early beneficiary of the Passamaquoddy precedent . In an opinion striking all the defendants ' affirmative defenses against the Narragansett land claim , the Rhode Island district court noted that " [ our ] task has been greatly simplified by the First Circuit 's analysis of the [ Nonintercourse ] Act in " Passamaquoddy . Citing Passamaquoddy , that court held that neither Rhode Island 's unilateral attempt to disband the Narragansett tribe nor its provision of services to the tribe " could operate to terminate the trust relationship . " Instead , the court held that the Narragansett need only establish that they were a tribe " racially and culturally " to come within the protection of the Act . The Narragansett claim was settled by legislation in 1978 . 
 In Mashpee Tribe v. New Seabury Corp. ( 1979 ) , the First Circuit confronted a land claim by a non @-@ federally recognized tribe in Massachusetts . This time , because the tribe sought damages rather than a declaratory judgment , the question of tribal status went to a jury . And , the First Circuit affirmed the jury 's finding that the Mashpee had ceased to be a tribe . Mashpee cited Passamaquoddy for the principle that " courts will accord substantial weight to federal recognition of a tribe . " Although Passamaquoddy held that only Congress could terminate the trust relationship , Mashpee noted that " [ t ] he establishment of a trust relationship with tribes generally , however , did not guarantee the perpetual existence of any particular tribe . Plaintiff here must still prove that it was a tribe at the relevant times before it can claim the benefit of a trust relationship . " And , the First Circuit has held that only tribes , and not individual Indians , may bring Nonintercourse Act claims . 
 In Mashpee , the First Circuit rejected the Mashpee 's attempt to stay the litigation until the Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) could adjudicate the tribe 's petition for federal recognition . The court noted : " The Department has never formally passed on the tribal status of the <unk> or , so far as the record shows , any other group whose status was disputed . Therefore , the Department does not yet have prescribed procedures and has not been called on to develop special expertise in distinguishing tribes from other groups of Indians . " Yet , in 1978 , the BIA had promulgated regulations establishing the criteria for federal recognition of tribes . In light of these new regulations , and their later use , the Second Circuit has held that the BIA retains " primary jurisdiction " over tribal recognition . In other words , Nonintercourse Act claims by unrecognized tribes must be stayed until the BIA is given a timely opportunity to adjudicate the tribe 's petition for recognition . If the BIA rejects a tribe 's petition , the tribe 's Nonintercourse Act claim may be barred by collateral estoppel .

 In 1979 , John M.R. Paterson and David Roseman — who , as Deputy and Assistant Attorneys General for the State of Maine , respectively , were involved in the litigation — published a law review article criticizing the First Circuit 's Passamaquoddy decision . Paterson and Roseman argued that the Nonintercourse Act 's restriction on land purchases from tribes was not meant to apply to land within the territory of a U.S. state . According to Paterson and Roseman , " [ n ] either the district nor circuit courts in Passamaquoddy v. Morton had all the available legislative history , administrative rulings , legal analysis or case law necessary to make a fully informed decision . " 
 Kempers ' 1989 study of the settlement is based on 35 interviews conducted with members of the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot tribes ( 24 Penobscot members and 11 Passamaquoddy members ) conducted between September and December 1985 . According to Kempers , " [ t ] here is no clear consensus on how much the tribes gained or lost in the final negotiations . " But , in Kempers ' view , " [ i ] n the final analysis , however , the settlement negotiations appear to have compromised the very basis of the claim " by bringing the tribes under " much closer state supervision . " " In a very real way , the deterioration of culture that the tribes ' sought to reverse by going to court was aggravated by the litigation and the political negotiation of their claim . " 
 = Aqua ( Kingdom Hearts ) = 
 Aqua ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : <unk> ) , also known as Master Aqua ( <unk> ・ <unk> , Masutā <unk> ) , is a fictional character from Square Enix 's video game franchise Kingdom Hearts . Having first made cameo appearances in the game Kingdom Hearts II , Aqua was introduced in the 2010 prequel Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep as one of the three protagonists . In the title , Aqua is introduced as a Keyblade @-@ wielding warrior training under Master Eraqus alongside her best friends Terra and Ventus . Following the disappearance of Master Xehanort , a comrade of Eraqus , Aqua and Terra are tasked with searching for him as while protecting the worlds from creatures known as Unversed . 
 Unlike Terra and Ventus , Aqua was the only protagonist from Birth by Sleep who did not have a point of reference for director Tetsuya Nomura to design from , and thus was designed from scratch . Later in the design process , Nomura became concerned that Aqua would not be a popular character , and this drove his decision to make her very distinct in her personal bravery and combat abilities . While her outfit design was based on Terra 's , her movements were chosen to distinguish her from other characters by having her specialize in magical combat . Aqua has been voiced by Megumi Toyoguchi in Japanese and Willa Holland in English . Aqua received mixed reviews from game critics , citing boring plot lines and unenthusiastic voice acting combined with weak combat skills . With fans , Aqua was well received , and is one of Kingdom Hearts most popular characters . 
 = = Appearances = = 
 Before her introduction as a main character in Kingdom Hearts : Birth by Sleep , Aqua had earlier made small appearances in the secret endings from Kingdom Hearts II and its re @-@ release , Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix . Both events depicted Terra , Ventus and Aqua fighting Xehanort and his apprentice Vanitas . Moreover , Aqua 's Keyblade and armor appear in a room from Radiant Garden in Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix , which Xemnas , the " Nobody " of Xehanort , often visits calling the armor " friend " . 
 In Birth by Sleep , Aqua apprentices in the Land of Departure where potential Keyblade Masters study to receive their " Mark of Mastery " . Training alongside Aqua are her friends Terra and Ventus . Aqua takes the Mark of Mastery exam along with Terra and becomes a Keyblade Master . When Xehanort goes missing , their teacher Eraqus instructs Terra and Aqua to find him while also protecting the worlds they visit from creatures known as the Unversed . Following Terra 's departure , Eraqus asks Aqua to watch over Terra to see if he succumbs to his inner darkness and also bring back Ventus who has suddenly left the world . As she travels across the worlds , Aqua starts to question Terra 's actions in the worlds , while Ventus decides not to return home until Terra is safe . When Aqua meets Yen Sid , an acquaintance of Eraqus , Aqua is told that the latter was killed by Xehanort with Terra 's assistance . Aqua then goes to the Keyblade Graveyard to face confront Terra . He explains to Aqua how Xehanort tricked him into fighting Eraqus , while Ventus reveals that Xehanort plans to use him and his apprentice Vanitas to create the ultimate weapon , a Keyblade known as the χ @-@ blade . The three are then confronted by Xehanort and Vanitas , and proceed to battle . While Terra goes to battle Xehanort , Vanitas takes possession of Ventus ' body to create the χ @-@ blade . With help from King Mickey , Yen Sid 's student , Aqua fights the possessed Ventus until the χ @-@ blade explodes . After learning that Ventus has lost his heart , Aqua locks his catatonic body in Castle Oblivion created from the ruins of the Land of the Departure with Eraqus 's Keyblade . Aqua then tracks Terra to the Radiant Garden , only to find that he has been possessed by Xehanort . In the ensuing battle , Terra 's presence manifests , causing Xehanort to unlock his own heart in the internal struggle , and having lost his essence that makes him a whole person , he falls into the Realm of Darkness . However , Aqua saves Terra 's heart by sending her armor and Keyblade with him back to Radiant Garden . But Aqua ends up trapped in the nexus of the darkness in people 's hearts called the Realm of Darkness . Sometime after the events of Kingdom Hearts II , she meets Ansem the Wise , the former ruler of Radiant Garden , at the shores of the Dark Margin , a black moon @-@ lit ocean in the Realm of Darkness , and learns about the events that occurred in her absence regarding Sora , the new Keyblade bearer . Upon hearing Sora 's name and recognizing it as the name of the little boy she met on Destiny Islands who now possesses Ventus ' heart , Aqua sheds a tear and utters Sora 's name with renewed hope . 
 Birth by Sleep Final Mix , an update of Birth by Sleep , features a secret episode that slightly expands on Aqua 's time in the Realm of Darkness , battling Heartless with her master 's Keyblade . 
 In Kingdom Hearts Re : coded , Aqua is revealed to be one of the many people connected with Sora 's heart , causing Mickey to ask Sora to rescue them . She also makes small appearances in Kingdom Hearts 3D : Dream Drop Distance as part of Sora 's memories and in the ending where she is still at the shores of the Dark Margin . 
 Aqua is slated to be the protagonist of Kingdom Hearts 0 @.@ 2 Birth by Sleep -A fragmentary <unk> , which is part of Kingdom Hearts HD 2 @.@ 8 Final Chapter Prologue . This new chapter is a prologue to the events of Kingdom Hearts III , which heavily expands on her time in the Realm of Darkness . 
 = = Creation and development = = 
 For Aqua 's unnamed first appearance in the secret ending of Kingdom Hearts II , director Tetsuya Nomura stated he did not design her appearance , but had instead focused on what her story would be . While unwilling say who the character was , Nomura pointed that this new character scenes , along with Terra 's and Ventus ' scenes occurred prior to the events from the first game . Following the release of Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix , Nomura revealed more details about Aqua such as a connection with the character Xemnas . Nomura also revealed her name as said by the Lingering Sentiment in Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix and explained that her name follows the " water " theme brought by Kairi 's name . However , a connection with Kairi was not intended , but rather with the series ' main characters whose names bear various themes . 
 In contrast to Terra and Ventus , Aqua did not have a reference point for the characters design , leading Nomura to create a completely new character from scratch . Her outfit was based on Terra 's Japanese @-@ inspired clothes which are meant to expand the student @-@ and @-@ teacher bond shown in the game . Aqua 's outfit was altered three times during the game 's development . Nomura felt the open back of Aqua ’ s outfit presented at the Tokyo Game Show 2009 was too revealing and modified the design to be more conservative . As with Terra and Ventus , the making of Aqua 's outfit created issues for Nomura like how she would be able to summon her armor . To remedy this , an " X " was added to her clothes as a means to activate her armor . When designing Aqua , Nomura was worried the character would be unpopular due to her weak connection with other Kingdom Hearts characters . This led to a push to make the character distinctly " strong " , which Nomura also did with Xion for Kingdom Hearts 358 / 2 Days but in a different way . While Xion was also a " brave girl " , Nomura wanted to retain <unk> feminine qualities along with her strength . After design was completed , Nomura was still unsure how Aqua would be received . After release however , Nomura noted her popularity with fans , and referenced Megumi Toyoguchi 's work as her voice actress as one of the reasons . Toyoguchi had already worked with Nomura in Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 voicing Paine , one of the game 's protagonists . While Toyoguchi used a low tone with Paine , she used tone closer to her original voice when voicing Aqua , which Nomura praised . 
 From the beginning of Kingdom Hearts : Birth by Sleeps development , the staff decided its story would have three plot lines centered around three different characters with Aqua 's being the last one written . The original ending of Aqua 's storyline showed her trapped in the Realm of Darkness , but that part was moved to the game 's " Last Episode " playthrough in order to keep the game from being too negative in tone . In terms of gameplay , Aqua was designed to be a character gamers would take some getting used to , and recommended them use her as the last one in order to understand the game 's story better , as he points that scenario with the intention that Aqua would be the last character to leave the Land of Departure . The staff developed her movements to reflect her personality as a serious and dignified young woman .

 Aqua 's character has received mixed response from video game publications with initial comments focused on her brief appearance in Kingdom Hearts II . Writing for GamesRadar , Chris Antista commented that he did not understand the importance of Aqua and the other characters being briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II , and only later was their importance explored at the end of Birth by Sleep . Prior to Aqua 's appearance in Birth by Sleep 's trailers , 1UP.com 's Jeremy Parish stated that fans speculated that the character would be male . Having played a demo from Birth by Sleep as Aqua in the E3 2010 , Ryan Clements from IGN enjoyed her character due to her gameplay mechanics . 
 While reviewing Birth by Sleep , Adam <unk> from PALGN criticizing her " idealistic " dialogues , finding them repetitive . PlayStation LifeStyle 's Thomas Williams found the trio as welcome additions to the franchise , finding their stories enjoyable even though the three travel to the same worlds . Kevin VanOrd from GameSpot gave praise to Aqua 's character , based on her personality , how it counterparts Ventus ' as well as Holland 's voice acting . 1UP.com 's Steve Watts found Aqua 's gameplay as the weakest from all the three characters as in contrast to Ventus and Terra , she specializes in magic techniques which are weak during the game 's start . On the other hand , Bob Miur from Destructoid found it appealing due to how it contrast previous fighting styles seen in the Kingdom Hearts series . Aqua 's story was also found less entertaining than Ventus ' , but also less predictable than Terra 's . Following Square 's advice of using Aqua as the last playable GameInformer writer Bryan Vore liked how her actions were played with Ventus ' and Terra 's . However , Bore still cited Aqua 's playthrough as repetitive if played as the last one , and also said its plot was weakest from all of them . Alongside Ventus and Terra , X @-@ Play found Aqua similar to the protagonists from Kingdom Hearts with her being compared with Kairi . In contrast to Van Ord , RPGFan 's Ashton Liu found Aqua 's voice " bored for almost the whole game " , citing how it is notable when comparing her with other voice actors such as Mark Hamill and Leonard Nimoy . In an ASCII Media Works poll , Aqua was voted as the twelfth most popular video game character from 2010 . In a Famitsu poll from 2011 , Aqua was voted as the fourth most popular Kingdom Hearts character .

 Lundgren started researching human trafficking in 2005 . He claimed there were " 20 million slaves in the world " , and that human trafficking was a " $ 20 billion industry " ; the world 's " second largest " illegal trafficking enterprise ( as of 2015 ) . He started developing Skin Trade in 2007 ; after reading a news report about a group of girls being smuggled into the United States from Mexico . The girls were left in a vehicle along the border ; trapped inside and with no means of escape , they all died of heat stroke and suffocation . Lundgren , who had " two young daughters " at the time , felt the story of human trafficking " had to be told " . He related with each of the victims , saying : " these people are physically humiliated [ and ] psychologically abused to have no self worth , sort of like [ how ] I used to feel " . 
 = = = Screenplay = = = 
 Lundgren wrote the screenplay with Gabriel <unk> and Steven Elder , while John Hyams performed uncredited script revisions ; seven in total , frequently regarding the setting as Lundgren sought financing . The original script was set in Russia . Lundgren even went as far as to scout for locations and actors ; and to seek financing in Moscow , but it " didn 't work out " . He changed the setting to Southeast Asia after meeting " someone " interested in financing the film . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Originally , Lundgren planned on playing a supporting role , with a more famous actor in the lead . He also considered directing the film , but decided against it , as he desired to learn more about producing . In 2013 , Lundgren announced the casting of Tony Jaa , in the role of Tony Vitayakul ; and <unk> Uekrongtham as the director . Lundgren chose Uekrongtham after being impressed with his film , Beautiful Boxer . He contacted him through a mutual friend in Los Angeles , and in mid @-@ 2013 , they arranged to meet in the city . While he had previously turned down scripts offered to him for international markets , Uekrongtham found Skin Trade " riveting " . He said the script " [ had ] the potential to work as a character @-@ driven piece while saying something about how we deal with scars , literal and otherwise " . Jaa , on the other hand , met with Lundgren through his manager and film agent . He couldn 't speak any English when cast , but claimed to have taken " intensive " lessons in preparation for his role ; stating he is now " reasonably fluent " in " conversational " English . 
 Tasya Teles was cast as Rosa Cassidy on Christmas Day , 2013 . She was heading to Thailand for a holiday " after a year of hard work " , and her agent phoned to tell her about the " perfect role " ; even insisting on her having a " quick look " at the script . Once Teles realized Skin Trade was about human trafficking , she was " instantly hooked " . 
 On February 7 , 2014 , SC Films announced the casting of Michael Jai White , Ron Perlman , Peter Weller , Celina Jade , and Cary @-@ Hiroyuki Tagawa . The film 's co @-@ producer , Craig Baumgarten , was White and Weller 's manager ; he secured them both roles in the film . Weller was the original choice to play Viktor Dragovic , but due to scheduling issues , the role went to Perlman instead . Furthermore , Lundgren considered having White to co @-@ star ; White only accepted the role of FBI agent Reed after finding the script " appealing " .

 Filming began on February 2 , 2014 in Thailand . Skin Trade was shot over 50 days : 43 filming in Thailand , and four filming in Vancouver , Canada . In Thailand , filming locations included : Suvarnabhumi Airport , the Min Buri District , the Siam Kempinski Hotel , a rice mill , a leather @-@ bleaching factory , and a century @-@ old mansion . Filming was briefly disrupted by public protests relating to the Thai political crisis . To avoid any further interference , the cast and crew had to travel early to get through the traffic and to the set on time . Most of the film was shot on location , but some scenes were filmed at <unk> Studios . Skin Trade was the first film to be shot in English by an organization based in Asia ( outside of Hong Kong ) for an international theatrical release . 
 Uekrongtham arranged a " few lunches and dinners " between Lundgren and his on @-@ screen family ( Tasya Teles and Chloe Babcook ) , so they could bond " on a personal level " before filming scenes together . Babcook spent a week and a half filming her scenes in Bangkok , followed by a few days of filming in Vancouver . 
 The " heavily choreographed " fight scene between Lundgren and Jaa was planned over " [ one ] or two " months . It was rehearsed for two weeks and took a further week to film . Due to Lundgren 's role as co @-@ producer , the cast had a lot of freedom to improvise their scenes . Jaa filmed his fight scenes without using wirework or CGI . He felt this would give his character " more depth " and allow him to better display his acting abilities . Jaa also performed all of his own stunts . Lundgren claimed he was " very impressed " by Jaa 's acting and fighting abilities . In his opinion , the majority of people wouldn 't be able to perform Jaa 's stunts without using wirework . 
 According to White , his fight scenes with Jaa were " largely " choreographed ten minutes before filming . On the contrary , Jaa insisted it was something they were practicing " right up until the shoot " . He recalled that while they were rehearsing the sequences and moves together " quite extensively " for a " number of days " , they didn 't rehearse them on the film set . The fight was filmed in three takes .

 Skin Trade received mostly negative reviews . Rotten Tomatoes reports that 25 percent of critics gave a positive review ; the " average " rating being 4 @.@ 8 out of 10 . On Metacritic , the film has a score of 39 out of 100 , also indicating " generally unfavorable " reviews . 
 Martin Tsai , of the LA Times , described the film as a " movie where cops self @-@ righteously act as judge , jury and executioner " , without considering any protocols or procedures . He also said the film barely touches upon human trafficking . Nick Schager , of Variety , came to a similar conclusion , calling the issue of human trafficking ( within the film ) a " window dressing " for standard " revenge @-@ driven " action . Schager also criticized Jaa 's lack of fluency in English . Other critics have had similar feelings ; Ignatiy Vishnevetsky , of A.V. Club , called it one of the film 's " biggest drawbacks " . 
 Chuck Bowen , of Slant Magazine , heavily criticized the film ; he awarded zero out of four stars . He said Skin Trade " fails " to satisfy even the " qualified expectations " that someone brings to a " low @-@ rent Dolph Lundgren ass @-@ kicker " . Bowen went on to say there is " no beauty to this film , little rhythm " , and none of the " physical grace " that action @-@ film fans " crave " . 
 Frank Scheck , of The Hollywood Reporter , rated the film as poor , saying the film is " more suitable for late night cable viewing " than a theatrical release . He went on to criticize Uekrongtham 's directing , saying that " [ Uekrongtham ] clearly paid more attention to the casting than the onscreen mechanics . And for a film so seemingly interested in educating audiences about the evils of sex trafficking " , Uekrongtham has no problem with " including [ a ] copious [ amount ] of female nudity " . 
 Scott Tobias , of The Dissolve , rated the film two and a half out of five . Calling the film a " throwback to the one @-@ man @-@ army [ action films ] " of the 1980s , he said " if the film happens to raise awareness [ of human trafficking ] " , then it 's more of a " bonus than an objective " . Tobias took a disliking to the film 's " needlessly complicated setup " , which - according to him - " posits Skin Trade as the splashy global production that it [ clearly ] is not " . 
 Simon Abrams , of <unk> , gave the film a positive review ; he awarded three out of four stars , and praised the film 's choreography and fight scenes . He said that " while time hasn 't been kind to the best ass @-@ kicking knuckle @-@ <unk> , Skin Trade is energetic and winsome " . In his opinion , the movie " hails " from a " decadent period of action cinema " ; " when every renegade cop had a private vendetta , a pet charity / social concern , and a few lousy quips in his back pocket " . He summed his review saying : " you can teach a new dog old tricks , though why you would want to is anyone 's guess " . The Action Elite 's Eoin Friel also enjoyed the film ; he awarded four out of five stars , and praised the choreography , stunts and fight scenes . Unlike Schager or Vishnevetsky , Friel had no issues with Jaa 's fluency in English , and even felt he " handled " the language " pretty well " .

 When Deangelo Vickers ends up in a coma on life support , Jo Bennett ( guest star Kathy Bates ) makes Dwight ( Rainn Wilson ) the interim regional manager before they find a proper replacement , much to Jim 's chagrin , as the office had actually functioned very smoothly during the manager hiatus . As Jim ( John Krasinski ) notes , everyone showed up , worked for the day with reasonable breaks , and were highly productive . Once appointed , Dwight establishes a strict management style in stark contrast to their previously relaxed style , from making the employees say the Pledge of Allegiance to setting up firewalls and long passwords to use the office 's various machines and installing antique punch clocks . Jim , who had turned down the temporary manager position believing that they should not be assigned one at all , is especially unhappy with the changes , and begins pranking Dwight by suggesting that he is leading an uprising called " The Fist " . In order to impress Jo , Dwight buys a gun , though he is more excited when he receives a holster as a gift from a relative , and uses the gun to <unk> . Pam ( Jenna Fischer ) insists that he put it away , but Dwight accidentally fires the gun right by Andy ( Ed Helms ) , causing him temporary hearing loss . Dwight attempts to bribe the office workers into silence with various favors , and Jim insists that Dwight do outlandish things ( such as saying " <unk> , baby " ) at certain promptings . 
 Meanwhile , Gabe ( Zach Woods ) continues with his attempts to win back Erin ( Ellie Kemper ) . He invites Andy to go to the conference room to speak in private . Gabe breaks down , and Andy promises he won 't date Erin again . Gabe confronts Andy with the promise after he sees the two hanging out together , but Andy stands up for himself and embarrasses Gabe by describing Gabe 's crying fit to Erin . When asked whether he wants to date Erin , he refuses to give a straight answer . 
 When Jo comes to visit the branch , Dwight admits to the gun incident . He attempts to divert the blame to his employees , saying that blackmail is a bigger crime than firing a gun accidentally , but Jo takes the position away from him . Jo later puts Creed ( Creed Bratton ) , who has the most seniority in the office , in charge until a committee composed of Jim , Toby ( Paul Lieberstein ) , and Gabe find a replacement . While Jim tells Dwight that Jo did the right thing , he also compliments Dwight , noting that the office got every single company order out on time . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Dwight K. Schrute , ( Acting ) Manager " was the ninth episode of the series written by supervising producer Justin Spitzer , and the first directed by Troy Miller . The original working title for this episode was " Interim Manager " but was considered too bland by Office writer Mindy Kaling . While writing the episode , Spitzer originally titled it " Dwight K. Schrute " , but decided the title was not descriptive enough , so he renamed it " Dwight K. Schrute , Interim Manager " , before realizing that Acting Manager fits Dwight 's role better and changed it to " Dwight K. Schrute , Acting Manager " . Spitzer then decided that Dwight would downplay the acting part of the position and renamed the episode to its current title " Dwight K. Schrute , ( Acting ) Manager " . 
 The episode features the return of Kathy Bates as Jo Bennett . This is her first on @-@ screen appearance since " Nepotism " . The long absence is due to her starring in the other NBC series , Harry 's Law . The episode also marks the second appearance of Cody Horn as Jordan Garfield , Deangelo 's executive assistant , and the first of three new roles since Carell 's departure . The role was originally said to be recurring at first with a chance of her becoming a series regular in the eighth season . She eventually did not return for the eighth season . The episode also features a voice guest appearance from former producer and writer for The Office Michael Schur as Mose Schrute , his first appearance on the show since " Counseling " due to his being the show runner for the other NBC sitcom , Parks and Recreation . 
 The official website for The Office included two cut scenes from " Dwight K. Schrute , ( Acting ) Manager " within a week of the episode 's release . In the first , 66 @-@ second clip , Dwight shows the documentary crew his new office apparel including his desk modeled after Uday Hussein 's desk .
