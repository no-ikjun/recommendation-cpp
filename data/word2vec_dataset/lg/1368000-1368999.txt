 = = = = Conwy Castle and town walls = = = = 
 Conwy Castle hugs a rocky coastal ridge of grey sandstone and limestone , and much of the stone from the castle is largely taken from the ridge itself , probably when the site was first cleared . The castle has a rectangular plan and is divided into an inner and outer ward , with four large towers on each side . The main entrance to the castle is through the western barbican , an exterior defence in front of the main gate . The barbican features the earliest surviving stone machicolations in Britain . A postern gate originally led down to the river where a small dock was built , allowing key visitors to enter the castle in private and for the fortress to be resupplied by boat . Conwy 's outer ward was originally crowded with administrative and service buildings . The inner ward was separated from the outer by a wall , a drawbridge and a gate , protected by a ditch cut into the rock . Inside , it contained the chambers for the royal household , their immediate staff and service facilities . On the east side of the inner ward is another barbican , enclosing the castle garden . 
 The Conwy town walls form a largely unbroken , 1 @.@ 3 km ( 0 @.@ 81 mi ) long triangular circuit around the town , enclosing 10 hectares ( 25 acres ) . They are mostly built from the same local sand- and limestone used at the castle , but with additional rhyolite stone used along the upper parts of the eastern walls . When first built , the walls were possibly whitewashed . The 21 surviving towers are mostly " gap @-@ backed " , lacking walls on the inside of the towers , and originally included removable wooden bridges to allow sections of the walls to be sealed off from attackers . The tops of the walls feature an unusual design that uses a sequence of corbels to provide a flat , relatively wide wall @-@ walk . A unique set of twelve medieval latrines is built into the southern town walls , first constructed for the use of royal staff working in adjacent buildings in the 13th century .

 On June 13 , 2015 it was confirmed through Anime News Network that Japanese group Kisida Kyoudan & The <unk> Rockets would release a new song titled " Gate ( Sore wa Akatsuki no you ni ) " , and would serve as the opening theme song to the first season of Japanese anime television series , Gate : Jieitai Kanochi nite , Kaku Tatakaeri . The lyrics were written by Kisida and the music and arrangement were created by the band . Musically , it is a rock song that features guitars , drums , and bass guitars in its instrumentation . According to Japanese music magazine CD Journal , they described the rock composition as " loud " and " sharp " . 
 It was released as the group 's first single in two years by Warner Bros. Entertainment and their subsidiary label Warner Home Video on July 29 , 2015 . It was first released on a CD single in Japan , which included the track , a B @-@ side song titled " <unk> Hero " , and both their respective instrumental versions . The second format was the CD and DVD single , which included the same audio track list , but also featured the full music video on the second disc . The final physical format was a special anime CD that included the track , a shortened version dubbed " TV size " , and the instrumental . The digital EP included the four recordings , released only in Japan . Each format , apart from the digital release , includes three different artworks with all promotional images taken from the television series .

 Upon its release , it received positive reviews from music critics . A staff member at CD Journal was positive , complimenting the songwriting on how it holds a " sharp message " for listeners to understand . The review concluded with the reviewer labeling it " exhilarating " . In a similar review , The News Hub 's Can Hoang Tran said that " There are times that you may have rewound the anime to the very beginning just to listen to the theme song . I consider myself part of that group of anime let alone Gate fans . " He called it one of 2015 's " catchy and [ energetic ] " anime theme songs . Josh Piedra from The <unk> enjoyed the song as a " Kyoudan fan " , but stated that " The opening song is a catchy one ... but it still sounds like your typical mainstream J @-@ Rock with female lead vocals . " 
 Commercially , the song was moderately successful in Japan . It debuted at number 17 on the Oricon Singles Chart , the group 's lowest entry at the time . Despite falling outside of the top 50 the following week , it lasted 10 weeks inside the top 200 . As of June 2016 , " Gate ( Sore wa Akatsuki no you ni ) " is the group 's third best selling single according to Oricon Style . It was success on Japan 's Billboard competent charts , peaking at number 15 on the Japan Hot 100 chart , two on the Hot Anime chart , and number 15 on the Hot Single Sales chart .

 = Herpes simplex = 
 Herpes simplex ( Greek : <unk> <unk> , " creeping " or " latent " ) is a viral disease caused by the herpes simplex virus . Infections are categorized based on the part of the body infected . Oral herpes involves the face or mouth . It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat . Genital herpes , often simply known as herpes , may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers . These typically heal over two to four weeks . Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear . Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms . The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever , muscle pains , swollen lymph nodes and headaches . Over time , episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity . Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include : herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers , herpes of the eye , herpes infection of the brain , and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn , among others . 
 There are two types of herpes simplex virus , type 1 ( HSV @-@ 1 ) and type 2 ( HSV @-@ 2 ) . HSV @-@ 1 more commonly causes oral infections while HSV @-@ 2 more commonly causes genital infections . They are transmitted by direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual . Transmission may still occur when symptoms are not present . Genital herpes is classified as a sexually transmitted infection . It may be spread to an infant during childbirth . After infection , the viruses are transported along sensory nerves to the nerve cell bodies , where they reside lifelong . Causes of recurrence may include : decreased immune function , stress , and sunlight exposure . Oral and genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms . The diagnosis may be confirmed by viral culture or detecting herpes DNA in fluid from blisters . Testing the blood for antibodies against the virus can confirm a previous infection but will be negative in new infections . 
 The most effective method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal , oral , and anal sex . Condom use decreases the risk somewhat . Daily antiviral medication taken by someone who has the infection can also reduce spread . There is no available vaccine and once infected , there is no cure . Paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) and topical lidocaine may be used to help with the symptoms . Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes . 
 Worldwide rates of either HSV @-@ 1 or HSV @-@ 2 are between 60 % and 95 % in adults . HSV @-@ 1 is usually acquired during childhood . Rates of both increase as people age . Rates of HSV @-@ 1 are between 70 % and 80 % in populations of low socioeconomic status and 40 % to 60 % in populations of improved socioeconomic status . An estimated 536 million people worldwide ( 16 % of the population ) were infected with HSV @-@ 2 as of 2003 with greater rates among women and those in the developing world . Most people with HSV @-@ 2 do not realize that they are infected . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Herpes simplex is divided into two types ; HSV @-@ 1 causes primarily mouth , throat , face , eye , and central nervous system infections , whereas HSV @-@ 2 causes primarily anogenital infections . However , each may cause infections in all areas . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 HSV infection causes several distinct medical disorders . Common infection of the skin or mucosa may affect the face and mouth ( orofacial herpes ) , genitalia ( genital herpes ) , or hands ( herpetic whitlow ) . More serious disorders occur when the virus infects and damages the eye ( herpes keratitis ) , or invades the central nervous system , damaging the brain ( herpes encephalitis ) . People with immature or suppressed immune systems , such as newborns , transplant recipients , or people with AIDS , are prone to severe complications from HSV infections . HSV infection has also been associated with cognitive deficits of bipolar disorder , and Alzheimer 's disease , although this is often dependent on the genetics of the infected person . 
 In all cases , HSV is never removed from the body by the immune system . Following a primary infection , the virus enters the nerves at the site of primary infection , migrates to the cell body of the neuron , and becomes latent in the ganglion . As a result of primary infection , the body produces antibodies to the particular type of HSV involved , preventing a subsequent infection of that type at a different site . In HSV @-@ 1 @-@ infected individuals , seroconversion after an oral infection prevents additional HSV @-@ 1 infections such as whitlow , genital herpes , and herpes of the eye . Prior HSV @-@ 1 seroconversion seems to reduce the symptoms of a later HSV @-@ 2 infection , although HSV @-@ 2 can still be contracted . 
 Many people infected with HSV @-@ 2 display no physical symptoms — individuals with no symptoms are described as asymptomatic or as having subclinical herpes . 
 = = = Other = = = 
 Neonatal herpes simplex is a HSV infection in an infant . It is a rare but serious condition , usually caused by vertical transmission of HSV @-@ 1 or -2 ) from mother to newborn . During immunodeficiency , herpes simplex can cause unusual lesions in the skin . One of the most striking is the appearance of clean linear <unk> in skin creases , with the appearance of a knife cut . Herpetic <unk> is a recurrent or initial herpes simplex infection affecting primarily the hair follicles . <unk> <unk> is an infection with herpesvirus in patients with chronic atopic dermatitis may result in spread of herpes simples throughout the <unk> areas . 
 Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis , a primary infection , typically presents as swelling of the conjunctiva and eyelids ( <unk> ) , accompanied by small white itchy lesions on the surface of the cornea . 
 Herpetic <unk> is a recurrent or initial herpes simplex infection affecting primarily the hair follicle . 
 = = = Bell 's palsy = = = 
 Although the exact cause of Bell 's palsy — a type of facial paralysis — is unknown , it may be related to reactivation of HSV @-@ 1 . This theory has been contested , however , since HSV is detected in large numbers of individuals having never experienced facial paralysis , and higher levels of antibodies for HSV are not found in HSV @-@ infected individuals with Bell 's palsy compared to those without . Regardless antivirals have been found to not improve outcomes . 
 = = = Alzheimer 's disease = = = 
 HSV @-@ 1 has been proposed as a possible cause of Alzheimer 's disease . In the presence of a certain gene variation ( APOE @-@ <unk> allele carriers ) , HSV @-@ 1 appears to be particularly damaging to the nervous system and increases one 's risk of developing Alzheimer 's disease . The virus interacts with the components and receptors of lipoproteins , which may lead to its development . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 Herpes is contracted through direct contact with an active lesion or body fluid of an infected person . Herpes transmission occurs between discordant partners ; a person with a history of infection ( HSV seropositive ) can pass the virus to an HSV seronegative person . Herpes simplex virus 2 is typically contracted through direct skin @-@ to @-@ skin contact with an infected individual , but can also be contracted by exposure to infected saliva , semen , vaginal fluid , or the fluid from herpetic blisters . To infect a new individual , HSV travels through tiny breaks in the skin or mucous membranes in the mouth or genital areas . Even microscopic abrasions on mucous membranes are sufficient to allow viral entry . 
 HSV asymptomatic shedding occurs at some time in most individuals infected with herpes . It can occur more than a week before or after a symptomatic recurrence in 50 % of cases . Virus enters into susceptible cells by entry receptors such as <unk> @-@ 1 , <unk> and 3 @-@ O <unk> <unk> sulfate . Infected people who show no visible symptoms may still shed and transmit viruses through their skin ; asymptomatic shedding may represent the most common form of HSV @-@ 2 transmission . Asymptomatic shedding is more frequent within the first 12 months of acquiring HSV . Concurrent infection with HIV increases the frequency and duration of asymptomatic shedding . Some individuals may have much lower patterns of shedding , but evidence supporting this is not fully verified ; no significant differences are seen in the frequency of asymptomatic shedding when comparing persons with one to 12 annual recurrences to those with no recurrences . 
 Antibodies that develop following an initial infection with a type of HSV prevents reinfection with the same virus type — a person with a history of orofacial infection caused by HSV @-@ 1 cannot contract herpes whitlow or a genital infection caused by HSV @-@ 1 . In a monogamous couple , a seronegative female runs a greater than 30 % per year risk of contracting an HSV infection from a seropositive male partner . If an oral HSV @-@ 1 infection is contracted first , seroconversion will have occurred after 6 weeks to provide protective antibodies against a future genital HSV @-@ 1 infection . Herpes simplex is a double @-@ stranded DNA virus . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Primary orofacial herpes is readily identified by clinical examination of persons with no previous history of lesions and contact with an individual with known HSV @-@ 1 infection . The appearance and distribution of sores in these individuals typically presents as multiple , round , superficial oral ulcers , accompanied by acute gingivitis . Adults with atypical presentation are more difficult to diagnose . Prodromal symptoms that occur before the appearance of herpetic lesions help differentiate HSV symptoms from the similar symptoms of other disorders , such as allergic stomatitis . When lesions do not appear inside the mouth , primary orofacial herpes is sometimes mistaken for impetigo , a bacterial infection . Common mouth ulcers ( aphthous ulcer ) also resemble <unk> herpes , but do not present a vesicular stage . 
 Genital herpes can be more difficult to diagnose than oral herpes , since most HSV @-@ 2 @-@ infected persons have no classical symptoms . Further confusing diagnosis , several other conditions resemble genital herpes , including fungal infection , lichen planus , atopic dermatitis , and <unk> . Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes . Laboratory tests include culture of the virus , direct fluorescent antibody ( DFA ) studies to detect virus , skin biopsy , and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA . Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses , their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice . 
 Until the 1980s serological tests for antibodies to HSV were rarely useful to diagnosis and not routinely used in clinical practice . The older IgM serologic assay could not differentiate between antibodies generated in response to HSV @-@ 1 or HSV @-@ 2 infection . However , a glycoprotein G @-@ specific ( IgG ) HSV test introduced in the 1980s is more than 98 % specific at discriminating HSV @-@ 1 from HSV @-@ 2 . 
 It should not be confused with conditions caused by other viruses in the <unk> family such as herpes zoster , which is caused by varicella zoster virus . The differential diagnosis includes hand , foot and mouth disease due to similar lesions on the skin . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 As with almost all sexually transmitted infections , women are more susceptible to acquiring genital HSV @-@ 2 than men . On an annual basis , without the use of antivirals or condoms , the transmission risk of HSV @-@ 2 from infected male to female is about 8 – 11 % . This is believed to be due to the increased exposure of mucosal tissue to potential infection sites . Transmission risk from infected female to male is around 4 – 5 % annually . Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50 % . Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios , meaning the infected partner will be seropositive but symptom @-@ free by about 50 % . Condom use also reduces the transmission risk significantly . Condom use is much more effective at preventing male @-@ to @-@ female transmission than vice versa . Previous HSV @-@ 1 infection appears to reduce the risk for acquisition of HSV @-@ 2 infection among women by a factor of three . 
 However , asymptomatic carriers of the HSV @-@ 2 virus are still contagious . In many infections , the first symptom people will have of their own infections is the horizontal transmission to a sexual partner or the vertical transmission of neonatal herpes to a newborn at term . Since most asymptomatic individuals are unaware of their infection , they are considered at high risk for spreading HSV . 
 In October 2011 , the anti @-@ HIV drug tenofovir , when used topically in a microbicidal vaginal gel , was reported to reduce herpes virus sexual transmission by 51 % . 
 = = = Barrier methods = = = 
 Condoms offer moderate protection against HSV @-@ 2 in both men and women , with consistent condom users having a 30 % <unk> risk of HSV @-@ 2 acquisition compared with those who never use condoms . A female condom can provide greater protection than the male condom , as it covers the labia . The virus cannot pass through a synthetic condom , but a male condom 's effectiveness is limited because herpes ulcers may appear on areas not covered by it . Neither type of condom prevents contact with the scrotum , anus , buttocks , or upper thighs , areas that may come in contact with ulcers or genital secretions during sexual activity . Protection against herpes simplex depends on the site of the ulcer ; therefore , if ulcers appear on areas not covered by condoms , abstaining from sexual activity until the ulcers are fully healed is one way to limit risk of transmission . The risk is not eliminated , however , as viral shedding capable of transmitting infection may still occur while the infected partner is asymptomatic . The use of condoms or dental dams also limits the transmission of herpes from the genitals of one partner to the mouth of the other ( or vice versa ) during oral sex . When one partner has a herpes simplex infection and the other does not , the use of antiviral medication , such as valaciclovir , in conjunction with a condom , further decreases the chances of transmission to the uninfected partner . Topical microbicides that contain chemicals that directly inactivate the virus and block viral entry are being investigated . 
 = = = Antivirals = = = 
 Antivirals may reduce asymptomatic shedding ; asymptomatic genital HSV @-@ 2 viral shedding is believed to occur on 20 % of days per year in patients not undergoing antiviral treatment , versus 10 % of days while on antiviral therapy . 
 = = = Pregnancy = = = 
 The risk of transmission from mother to baby is highest if the mother becomes infected around the time of delivery ( 30 % to 60 % ) , since insufficient time will have occurred for the generation and transfer of protective maternal antibodies before the birth of the child . In contrast , the risk falls to 3 % if the infection is recurrent , and is 1 – 3 % if the woman is seropositive for both HSV @-@ 1 and HSV @-@ 2 , and is less than 1 % if no lesions are visible . Women seropositive for only one type of HSV are only half as likely to transmit HSV as infected seronegative mothers . To prevent neonatal infections , seronegative women are recommended to avoid unprotected oral @-@ genital contact with an HSV @-@ 1 @-@ seropositive partner and conventional sex with a partner having a genital infection during the last trimester of pregnancy . Mothers infected with HSV are advised to avoid procedures that would cause trauma to the infant during birth ( e.g. fetal scalp electrodes , forceps , and vacuum extractors ) and , should lesions be present , to elect caesarean section to reduce exposure of the child to infected secretions in the birth canal . The use of antiviral treatments , such as acyclovir , given from the 36th week of pregnancy , limits HSV recurrence and shedding during childbirth , thereby reducing the need for caesarean section . 
 <unk> is the recommended antiviral for herpes suppressive therapy during the last months of pregnancy . The use of valaciclovir and famciclovir , while potentially improving compliance , have less @-@ well @-@ determined safety in pregnancy . 
 = = Management = = 
 No method eradicates herpes virus from the body , but antiviral medications can reduce the frequency , duration , and severity of outbreaks . Analgesics such as ibuprofen and paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) can reduce pain and fever . Topical anesthetic treatments such as <unk> , lidocaine , benzocaine , or <unk> can also relieve itching and pain .

 Several antiviral drugs are effective for treating herpes , including acyclovir , valaciclovir ( <unk> ) , famciclovir , and <unk> . <unk> was the first discovered and is now available in generic . <unk> is also available as a generic .

 A number of topical antivirals are effective for herpes <unk> , including acyclovir , <unk> , and <unk> .

 Certain dietary supplements and alternative remedies are claimed to be beneficial in the treatment of herpes . Evidence is insufficient , though , to support use of many of these compounds , including <unk> , <unk> , L @-@ lysine , zinc , <unk> bee products , and aloe vera . While a number of small studies show possible benefit from <unk> , L @-@ lysine , aspirin , lemon balm , topical zinc , or licorice root cream in treatment , these preliminary studies have not been confirmed by higher @-@ quality randomized controlled studies . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Following active infection , herpes viruses establish a latent infection in sensory and autonomic ganglia of the nervous system . The double @-@ stranded DNA of the virus is incorporated into the cell physiology by infection of the nucleus of a nerve 's cell body . HSV latency is static ; no virus is produced ; and is controlled by a number of viral genes , including latency @-@ associated transcript . 
 Many HSV @-@ infected people experience recurrence within the first year of infection . Prodrome precedes development of lesions . Prodromal symptoms include tingling ( paresthesia ) , itching , and pain where <unk> nerves innervate the skin . Prodrome may occur as long as several days or as short as a few hours before lesions develop . Beginning antiviral treatment when prodrome is experienced can reduce the appearance and duration of lesions in some individuals . During recurrence , fewer lesions are likely to develop and are less painful and heal faster ( within 5 – 10 days without antiviral treatment ) than those occurring during the primary infection . Subsequent outbreaks tend to be periodic or episodic , occurring on average four or five times a year when not using antiviral therapy . 
 The causes of reactivation are uncertain , but several potential triggers have been documented . A 2009 study showed the protein <unk> plays a key role in reactivation of the dormant virus . Changes in the immune system during menstruation may play a role in HSV @-@ 1 reactivation . Concurrent infections , such as viral upper respiratory tract infection or other febrile diseases , can cause outbreaks . Reactivation due to other infections is the likely source of the historic terms ' cold sore ' and ' fever blister ' . 
 Other identified triggers include local injury to the face , lips , eyes , or mouth ; trauma ; surgery ; radiotherapy ; and exposure to wind , ultraviolet light , or sunlight . 
 The frequency and severity of recurrent outbreaks vary greatly between people . Some individuals ' outbreaks can be quite debilitating , with large , painful lesions persisting for several weeks , while others experience only minor itching or burning for a few days . Some evidence indicates genetics play a role in the frequency of cold sore outbreaks . An area of human chromosome 21 that includes six genes has been linked to frequent oral herpes outbreaks . An immunity to the virus is built over time . Most infected individuals experience fewer outbreaks and outbreak symptoms often become less severe . After several years , some people become perpetually asymptomatic and no longer experience outbreaks , though they may still be contagious to others . <unk> individuals may experience longer , more frequent , and more severe episodes . Antiviral medication has been proven to shorten the frequency and duration of outbreaks . Outbreaks may occur at the original site of the infection or in proximity to nerve endings that reach out from the infected ganglia . In the case of a genital infection , sores can appear at the original site of infection or near the base of the spine , the buttocks , or the back of the thighs . HSV @-@ 2 @-@ infected individuals are at higher risk for acquiring HIV when practicing unprotected sex with HIV @-@ positive persons , in particular during an outbreak with active lesions . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Worldwide rates of either HSV @-@ 1 and / or HSV @-@ 2 are between 60 and 95 % in adults . HSV @-@ 1 is more common than HSV @-@ 2 , with rates of both increasing as people age . HSV @-@ 1 rates are between 70 % and 80 % in populations of low socioeconomic status and 40 % to 60 % in populations of improved socioeconomic status . An estimated 536 million people or 16 % of the population worldwide were infected with HSV @-@ 2 as of 2003 with greater rates among women and in those in the developing world . Rates of infection are determined by the presence of antibodies against either viral species . 
 In the US , 57 @.@ 7 % of the population is infected with HSV @-@ 1 and 16 @.@ 2 % are infected with HSV @-@ 2 . Among those HSV @-@ 2 @-@ seropositive , only 18 @.@ 9 % were aware they were infected . During 2005 – 2008 , the prevalence of HSV @-@ 2 was 39 @.@ 2 % in blacks and 20 @.@ 9 % in women . 
 The annual incidence in Canada of genital herpes due to HSV @-@ 1 and HSV @-@ 2 infection is not known ( for a review of HSV @-@ 1 / HSV @-@ 2 prevalence and incidence studies worldwide , see Smith and Robinson 2002 ) . As many as one in seven Canadians aged 14 to 59 may be infected with herpes simplex type 2 virus and more than 90 per cent of them may be unaware of their status , a new study suggests . In the United States , it is estimated that about 1 @,@ 640 @,@ 000 HSV @-@ 2 <unk> occur yearly ( 730 @,@ 000 men and 910 @,@ 000 women , or 8 @.@ 4 per 1 @,@ 000 persons ) . 
 In British Columbia in 1999 , the seroprevalence of HSV @-@ 2 antibody in leftover serum submitted for antenatal testing revealed a prevalence of 17 @.@ 3 % , ranging from 7 @.@ 1 % in women 15 – 19 years old to 28 @.@ 2 % in those 40 – 44 years .

 = = History = = 
 Herpes has been known for at least 2 @,@ 000 years . Emperor Tiberius is said to have banned kissing in Rome for a time due to so many people having cold sores . In the 16th @-@ century Romeo and Juliet , blisters " o 'er ladies ' lips " are mentioned . In the 18th century , it was so common among prostitutes that it was called " a vocational disease of women " . The term ' herpes simplex ' appeared in Richard Boulton 's A System of Rational and Practical <unk> in 1713 , where the terms ' herpes miliaris ' and ' herpes <unk> ' also appeared . Herpes was not found to be a virus until the 1940s . 
 Herpes antiviral therapy began in the early 1960s with the experimental use of medications that interfered with viral replication called deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) inhibitors . The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illnesses such as adult encephalitis , keratitis , in immunocompromised ( transplant ) patients , or disseminated herpes zoster . The original compounds used were 5 @-@ <unk> @-@ 2 ' <unk> , AKA <unk> , <unk> , or ( IDU ) and 1 @-@ β @-@ D @-@ <unk> or ara @-@ C , later marketed under the name <unk> or <unk> . The usage expanded to include topical treatment of herpes simplex , zoster , and varicella . Some trials combined different antivirals with differing results . The introduction of 9 @-@ β @-@ D @-@ <unk> , ( ara @-@ A or vidarabine ) , considerably less toxic than ara @-@ C , in the mid @-@ 1970s , heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal antiviral treatment . <unk> was the first systemically administered antiviral medication with activity against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life @-@ threatening HSV disease . Intravenous vidarabine was licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977 . Other experimental antivirals of that period included : heparin , <unk> ( TFT ) , <unk> , interferon , <unk> , and 5 @-@ <unk> @-@ 2 ' <unk> ( <unk> ) . The introduction of 9- ( 2 @-@ <unk> ) guanine , AKA acyclovir , in the late 1970s raised antiviral treatment another notch and led to vidarabine vs. acyclovir trials in the late 1980s . The lower toxicity and ease of administration over vidarabine has led to acyclovir becoming the drug of choice for herpes treatment after it was licensed by the FDA in 1998 . Another advantage in the treatment of neonatal herpes included greater reductions in mortality and morbidity with increased dosages , which did not occur when compared with increased dosages of vidarabine . However , acyclovir seems to inhibit antibody response , and newborns on acyclovir antiviral treatment experienced a slower rise in antibody titer than those on vidarabine . 
 = = Society and culture = = 
 Genital herpes simplex was not always stigmatised . It was merely a cold sore in an unusual place until the 1970s . As late as 1975 , a study of " Psychological morbidity in a clinic for sexually transmitted disease " does not mention herpes simplex because at that time , no significant morbidity problem ( i.e. mental anxiety or illness ) was associated with the virus . 
 Pedro <unk> states , " during the R & D of acyclovir ( <unk> ) , marketing [ department of Burroughs Wellcome ] insisted that there were ' no markets ' for this compound . Most had hardly heard of genital herpes ... " Thus , marketing the medical condition – separating the ' normal cold sore ' from the ' stigmatized genital infection ' was to become the key to marketing the drug , a process now known as ' disease mongering ' . 
 Since the creation of the herpes hype , some people experience negative feelings related to the condition following diagnosis , in particular if they have acquired the genital form of the disease . Feelings can include depression , fear of rejection , feelings of isolation , fear of being found out , and self @-@ destructive feelings . These feelings usually lessen over time . Much of the hysteria and stigma surrounding herpes stems from a media campaign beginning in the late 1970s and peaking in the early 1980s . Multiple articles were worded in fear @-@ mongering and anxiety @-@ provoking terminology , such as the now @-@ ubiquitous " attacks " , " outbreaks " , " victims " , and " sufferers " . At one point , the term " herpetic " even entered the popular lexicon . The articles were published by Reader 's Digest , U.S. News , and Time magazine , among others . A made @-@ for @-@ TV movie was named Intimate Agony . The peak was when Time magazine had ' Herpes : The New Scarlet Letter ' on the cover in August 1982 , forever stigmatizing the word in the public mind . Herpes support groups have been formed in the United States and the UK , providing information about herpes and running message forums and dating websites for sufferers . People with the herpes virus are often hesitant to divulge to other people , including friends and family , that they are infected . This is especially true of new or potential sexual partners whom they consider casual . 
 In a 2007 study , 1900 people ( 25 % of which had herpes ) ranked genital herpes second for social stigma , out of all sexually transmitted diseases ( HIV took the top spot for STD stigma ) .

 An important source of support is the National Herpes Resource Center which arose from the work of the American Social Health Association ( ASHA ) . The ASHA was created in 1914 to in response to the increase in social diseases that had spread during World War 1 . During the 1970s , there was an increase in sexually transmitted diseases . One of the diseases that increased dramatically was genital herpes . In response , ASHA created the National Herpes Resource Center in 1979 . The HRC was designed to meet the growing need for education and awareness about the virus . One of the projects of The Herpes Resource Center ( HRC ) was to create a network of local support ( HELP ) groups . The goal of these HELP groups was to provide a safe , confidential environment where participants can get accurate information and share experiences , fears , and feelings with others who are concerned about herpes .

 In the UK , the Herpes Association ( now the Herpes Viruses Association ) was started in 1982 , becoming a registered charity with a Dept of Health grant in 1985 . The charity started as a string of local group meetings before acquiring an office and a national spread . 
 = = Research = = 
 Substantial research has gone into vaccines for both prevention and treatment of herpes infections . Unsuccessful clinical trials have been conducted for glycoprotein subunit vaccines . For therapy , only a single replication @-@ competent HSV vaccine has undergone human testing . As of 2011 , the future pipeline includes several promising replication @-@ incompetent vaccine proposals while two replication @-@ competent vaccine proposals require further animal testing . 
 Researchers at the University of Florida have made a hammerhead ribozyme that targets and cleaves the mRNA of essential genes in HSV @-@ 1 . The hammerhead , which targets the mRNA of the <unk> gene , greatly reduced the level of HSV @-@ 1 ocular infection in rabbits , and reduced the viral yield in vivo . The gene @-@ targeting approach uses a specially designed RNA enzyme to inhibit strains of the herpes simplex virus . The enzyme disables a gene responsible for producing a protein involved in the maturation and release of viral particles in an infected cell . The technique appears to be effective in experiments with mice and rabbits , but further research is required before it can be attempted in people infected with herpes . 
 Another possibility to eradicate the HSV @-@ 1 variant is being pursued by a team at Duke University . By figuring out how to switch all copies of the virus in the host from latency to their active stage at the same time , rather than the way the virus copies normally stagger their activity stage , leaving some dormant somewhere at all times , conventional antiviral drugs might kill the entire virus population , since they can no longer hide in the nerve cells . One class of drugs called <unk> could serve this purpose . These are chemically engineered oligonucleotides or short segments of RNA that can be made to mirror their target genetic material , namely herpes microRNAs . They could be engineered to attach and thus ' silence ' the microRNA , thus rendering the virus incapable of remaining latent in its host . Professor Cullen believes a drug could be developed to block the microRNA whose job it is to suppress HSV @-@ 1 into latency . 
 A genomic study of the herpes simplex type 1 virus confirmed the human migration pattern theory called ' out @-@ of @-@ Africa hypothesis ' .

 X2 ( sometimes promoted as X2 : X @-@ Men United , or internationally as X @-@ Men 2 ) is a 2003 American superhero film , based on the X @-@ Men superhero team appearing in Marvel Comics , distributed by 20th Century Fox . It is the sequel to 2000 's X @-@ Men and the second installment in the X @-@ Men film series . The film was directed by Bryan Singer , written by Michael Dougherty , Dan Harris , and David Hayter , and features an ensemble cast including Patrick Stewart , Hugh Jackman , Ian McKellen , Halle Berry , Famke Janssen , James Marsden , Rebecca Romijn @-@ Stamos , Brian Cox , Alan Cumming , Bruce Davison , and Anna Paquin . The plot , inspired by the graphic novel God Loves , Man Kills , pits the X @-@ Men and their enemies , the Brotherhood , against the genocidal Colonel William Stryker ( Brian Cox ) . He leads an assault on Professor Xavier 's school to build his own version of Xavier 's mutant @-@ tracking computer Cerebro , in order to destroy every mutant on Earth and to save the human race from them . 
 Development began shortly after X @-@ Men ( 2000 ) . David Hayter and Zak Penn wrote separate scripts , combining what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay . Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris were eventually hired to rewrite the work , and changed the characterizations of Beast , Angel , and Lady Deathstrike . Sentinels and the Danger Room were set to appear before being deleted because of budget concerns . The film 's premise was influenced by the Marvel Comics storylines Weapon X and God Loves , Man Kills . Filming began in June 2002 and ended that November . Most of the filming took place at Vancouver Film Studios , the largest North American production facility outside of Los Angeles . Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas adapted similar designs by John Myhre from the previous film . 
 X2 was released in the United States on May 2 , 2003 . It received positive reviews from critics , who mostly praised the storyline and acting of the film . The film received eight nominations at the Saturn Awards and grossed approximately $ 407 million worldwide . It is the sixth highest @-@ grossing film in the series .

 At the White House , brainwashed teleporting mutant Nightcrawler attempts to assassinate the President of the United States but fails and escapes . Meanwhile , Wolverine returns to Professor Xavier 's school for mutants , while fellow X @-@ Men Storm and Jean Grey find Nightcrawler with the help of the mutant @-@ tracking machine Cerebro . 
 Xavier and Cyclops visit Magneto in his plastic prison cell , inquiring about the assassination attempt , and Xavier discovers that military scientist Colonel William Stryker has been extracting information about Cerebro from a brainwashed Magneto using an injectable drug . Stryker and his assistant Yuriko Oyama capture Cyclops and Xavier and raid Xavier 's school . Wolverine kills many of Stryker 's men , while Colossus helps most of the students escape through hidden tunnels . Rogue , Iceman , Pyro , and Wolverine attempt to escape until Wolverine is confronted by Stryker , who fails to shed light on Wolverine 's past . Iceman helps Wolverine escape , but Stryker 's soldiers succeed in sedating six students and breaking into Cerebro . During a confrontation with the mutant @-@ hating Stryker , Xavier learns Stryker is behind the plot to assassinate the president . 
 <unk> Senator Robert Kelly and Yuriko , the shape @-@ shifting Mystique gains information about Magneto 's prison and helps him escape while also discovering schematics for another Cerebro . Wolverine , Rogue , Iceman , and Pyro visit Iceman 's parents in Boston . Responding to a 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 call from Bobby 's brother Ronny , the police arrive just as the group is leaving . Pyro uses his fire @-@ projection power to fend off the police . 
 The X @-@ Jet arrives to pick them up , and is targeted by two Air Force F @-@ 16 fighter jets . They are hit by a missile , but Magneto saves their jet from crashing . Magneto informs them that Stryker orchestrated the attack on the president to provide rationale to raid Xavier 's school in order to steal Cerebro 's parts , and plans to connect Xavier to another Cerebro rebuilt at a secret base . The X @-@ Men decide to team up with Magneto and Mystique to stop Stryker . Jean reads Nightcrawler 's mind and determines that Stryker 's base is inside the dam at Alkali Lake . 
 Through his son , Jason , Stryker gains control over Xavier , who is brainwashed to use the second Cerebro to find and kill all mutants . Mystique infiltrates Stryker 's base by impersonating Wolverine , and Storm and Nightcrawler search for the students . Jean , Magneto , and Mystique are attacked by a brainwashed Cyclops while trying to rescue Xavier , and cause damage to the generators that keep the dam from collapsing in the process . The force of Jean 's telekinetic blast clashing with Cyclops ' optic blast awakens him from his brainwashing , but cracks the dam . Wolverine finds Stryker in an adamantium smelting room , where he recovers some of his memory . Wolverine fights and kills Yuriko , and finds Stryker on a landing pad , where Stryker bargains for his life by offering to reveal Wolverine 's past . Wolverine refuses , and binds Stryker in chains . 
 Storm and Nightcrawler find the students , while Magneto and Mystique kill the rest of Stryker 's men . Magneto stops Jason and Xavier from using Cerebro to kill mutants . Disguised as Stryker , Mystique uses Jason to convince Xavier to kill all humans instead ; she and Magneto , along with new initiate Pyro , use Stryker 's helicopter to escape Alkali Lake , after chaining Stryker to concrete rubble . Nightcrawler teleports Storm inside Cerebro , where she creates a snowstorm to break Jason 's concentration and free Xavier from his control . 
 The X @-@ Men flee the base as water engulfs it , and discover that Magneto , Mystique , and Pyro have escaped on the helicopter . Iceman and Rogue arrive with the X @-@ Jet and get everyone on board . The dam bursts , flooding the landscape and killing Stryker . A malfunction aboard the X @-@ Jet prevents it from taking off ; Jean ultimately sacrifices herself and uses a telekinetic wall to shield them from the flood . She uses her leftover power to activate the X @-@ Jet 's primary engines and drops the torrent of water down on herself , which presumably drowns her . 
 The X @-@ Men give the President Stryker 's files , and Xavier warns him that humans and mutants must work together to build peace . Back at the school , Xavier , Cyclops , and Wolverine remember Jean , and Wolverine tells Cyclops that Jean chose Cyclops over him . As the film ends , Xavier states he believes everything will be alright , while a Phoenix @-@ like shape forms beneath Alkali Lake .

 Brian Cox as Col. William Stryker 
 A human military scientist who plans a worldwide genocide of mutants using Xavier and Cerebro . Stryker has experimented on mutants in the past , including Wolverine , and uses a serum to control them . Brad Loree plays a younger William Stryker in flashback scenes . Singer opted to cast Cox in the role as he was a fan of his performance as Hannibal Lecter in Manhunter . 
 Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler 
 A German mutant with a strong Catholic faith and the appearance of a blue demon . Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an assassination attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X @-@ Men . He is capable of teleporting himself ( and others ) instantly from one location to another . Nightcrawler can teleport through walls , but prefers to only teleport when he can see his landing site . On his body are many scarification marks , one for every sin . Cumming had always been Singer 's choice for the role , but at first he was not available due to scheduling conflicts . At some point , Ethan Embry had been reported to be in contention for the role . Ultimately , the film remained in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part . Singer also felt comfortable in casting him since he speaks German fluently . The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler 's makeup design , which took four hours to apply . For the scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off , Cumming went through nine hours of makeup . To best pose as Nightcrawler , Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character .

 Also , Katie Stuart appeared as Kitty Pryde , a mutant girl who can walk through walls ; Kea Wong as Jubilee , Bryce Hodgson as Artie , a mutant boy with a blue tongue ; Shauna Kain as <unk> , a mutant who is able to emit loud screams that alert the students to Stryker 's attack ; and Michael Reid McKay as Jason Stryker / Mutant 143 , William Stryker 's mutant son who has the ability to cast illusions . Also in the final scene with Xavier , a girl is seen dressed in a Native American style jacket , as well as a blond haired boy dressed in blue , played by <unk> Anderson . These were later confirmed to be Danielle Moonstar and Douglas Ramsey / Cypher . Daniel Cudmore appeared as Piotr " Peter " Rasputin / Colossus , introduced in this film as a young mutant with the ability to turn his body into organic steel , and possesses superhuman strength while in that form . Cudmore was set to use a Russian accent , but Singer dropped the idea of accents despite characters of different nationalities . 
 Jubilee , Psylocke and Multiple Man were to have cameos in the scene where Stryker and his troops storm the X @-@ Mansion . Beast , Gambit and Marrow were to have appearances during a sequence with Cerebro . Gambit 's cameo was actually shot , but the footage was not used in the final cut . Beast 's scene was to show him in his human form as Dr. Hank McCoy , while his skin morphed into blue fur , and Marrow was to be seen lying on a ground in New York City . Hank McCoy appears on a television during the scene where Mystique drugs Magneto 's prison guard . Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris , the film 's writers , cameo in scenes of Wolverine 's Weapon X flashbacks as surgeons . Bryan Singer , the film 's director , cameos as a security guard in a scene where Professor X and Cyclops go to see Magneto . Shaquille O 'Neal wanted a role in the film but was ignored by the filmmakers . 
 One scene depicts Mystique going through files on Stryker 's computer . Singer purposely included various names of characters and hints of storylines from X @-@ Men lore on several computer screens . Singer " [ found ] great difficulty in adapting all this stuff into a two and a half hour long movie . " 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 The financial and critical success of X @-@ Men persuaded 20th Century Fox to immediately commission a sequel . Starting in November 2000 , Bryan Singer researched various storylines ( one of them being the Legacy Virus ) of the X @-@ Men comic book series . Singer wanted to study , " the human perspective , the kind of blind rage that feeds into warmongering and terrorism , " citing a need for a " human villain " . Bryan and producer Tom DeSanto envisioned X2 as the film series ' The Empire Strikes Back , in that the characters are " all split apart , and then dissected , and revelations occur that are significant ... the romance comes to fruition and a lot of things happen . " Producer Avi Arad announced a planned November 2002 theatrical release date , while David Hayter and Zak Penn were hired to write separate scripts . Hayter and Penn combined what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay . Singer and Hayter worked on another script , finishing in October 2001 . 
 Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris were hired to rewrite Hayter and Penn 's script in February 2002 , turning down the opportunity to write Urban Legends : Bloody Mary . Angel and Beast appeared in early drafts , but were deleted because there were too many characters . Dr. Hank McCoy , however , can be seen on a television interview in one scene . Beast 's appearance was to resemble Jim Lee 's 1991 artwork of the character in the series X @-@ Men : Legacy . Angel was to have been a mutant experiment by William Stryker , transforming into Archangel . A reference to Dougherty 's and Harris ' efforts to include Angel remains in the form of an X @-@ ray on display in one of Stryker 's labs . Tyler Mane was to reprise as Sabretooth before the character was deleted . In Hayter 's script , the role eventually filled by Lady Deathstrike was Anne Reynolds , a character who appeared in God Loves , Man Kills as Stryker 's personal assistant / assassin . Singer changed her to Deathstrike , citing a need for " another kick @-@ ass mutant " . There was to be more development on Cyclops and Professor X being brainwashed by Stryker . The scenes were shot , but Fox cut them out because of time length and story complications . Hayter was disappointed , feeling that James Marsden deserved more screentime . 
 Rewrites were commissioned once more , specifically to give Halle Berry more screen time . This was because of her recent popularity in Monster 's Ball , earning her the Academy Award for Best Actress . A budget cut meant that the Sentinels and the Danger Room were dropped . Guy Hendrix Dyas and a production crew had already constructed the Danger Room set . In the words of Dyas , " The control room [ of the danger room ] was a large propeller that actually rotated around the room so that you can sit up [ in that control room ] and travel around the subject who is in the middle of the control room . The idea for the traveling is that if it 's a mutant has some kind of mind control powers they can 't connect . "

 Producer Lauren Shuler Donner had hoped to start filming in March 2002 , but production did not begin until June 17 , 2002 in Vancouver and ended by November . Over sixty @-@ four sets were used in thirty @-@ eight different locations . The film crew encountered problems when there was insufficient snow in Kananaskis , Alberta for them to use for some scenes . A large amount of fake snow was then applied . The idea to have Jean Grey sacrifice herself at the end and to be resurrected in a third installment was highly secretive . Singer did not tell Famke Janssen until midway through filming . Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and two stunt drivers nearly died when filming the scene in which Pyro has a dispute with police officers . 
 John Ottman composed the score . Ottman established a new title theme , as well as themes specifically for Magneto , Jean Grey , Nightcrawler , Mystique , and Pyro . 
 = = = Design and effects = = = 
 Singer and Sigel credited Road to Perdition as a visual influence . Though Sigel shot the first X @-@ Men in anamorphic format , he opted to shoot X2 in Super 35 . Sigel felt the recent improvements in film stocks and optics increased the advantages of using spherical lenses , even if the blowup to anamorphic must be accomplished optically instead of digitally . Sigel noted , " If you think about it , every anamorphic lens is simply a spherical lens with an <unk> on it . They 'll never be as good as the spherical lenses that they emulate . " Cameras that were used during filming included two Panaflex <unk> and a Millennium XL , as well as an <unk> 35mm . Singer also used zoom lenses more often than he did in his previous films , while Sigel used a Frazier lens specifically for dramatic moments . 
 The Blackbird was redesigned and increased in virtual size from 60 feet to 85 feet . John Myhre served as the production designer on the first film , but Singer hired Guy Hendrix Dyas for X2 , which was his first film as a production designer . For scenes involving Stryker 's Alkali Base , Vancouver Film Studios , the largest sound stage in North America , was reserved . 
 Visual effects supervisor Mike Fink was not satisfied with his work on the previous film , despite the fact it nearly received an Academy Award nomination . Up to 520 shots were created for X @-@ Men , while X2 commissioned roughly 800 . A new computer program was created by Rhythm and Hues for the dogfight tornado scene . Cinesite was in charge of scenes concerning Cerebro , enlisting a 20 @-@ man crew . The Alkali Lake Dam miniature was 25 ft ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) high and 28 ft ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) wide . Cinesite created 300 visual effects shots , focusing on character animation , while Rhythm and Hues created over 100 .

 The first cut of X2 was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America , due to violent shots with Wolverine when Stryker 's army storms the X @-@ Mansion . A few seconds were cut to secure a PG @-@ 13 rating . 
 X2 had a video game tie @-@ in , X2 : Wolverine 's Revenge , which is unrelated to the events of the film , although Patrick Stewart voiced Professor X and Hugh Jackman appears as Wolverine on the cover . The game received mixed reviews . X @-@ Men : The Official Game bridges the storyline between X2 and X @-@ Men : The Last Stand . Specifically , it explains Nightcrawler 's absence from The Last Stand . Chris Claremont wrote a novelization of the film , which left out its secretive cliffhanger . 
 The review @-@ aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 86 % of critics viewed the film favorably , based on 222 reviews . The sites consensus states : " Tightly scripted , solidly acted , and impressively ambitious , X2 : X @-@ Men United is bigger and better than its predecessor – and a benchmark for comic sequels in general . " Metacritic calculated an average score of 68 / 100 from 37 reviews . 
 Roger Ebert was impressed by how Singer was able to handle so many characters in one film , but felt " the storyline did not live up to its potential " . In addition , Ebert wrote that the film 's closing was perfect for a future installment , giving X2 three out of four stars . Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that it was rare for a sequel to be better than its predecessor . Turan observed that the film carried emotional themes that are present in the world today and commented that " the acting was better than usual [ for a superhero film ] " . Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that Hugh Jackman heavily improved his performance , concluding " X2 is a summer firecracker . It 's also a tribute to outcasts , teens , gays , minorities , even Dixie Chicks . " Empire called X2 the best comic book movie of all time in 2006 , while Wizard named the film 's ending as the 22nd greatest cliffhanger of all time . In May 2007 , Rotten Tomatoes listed X2 as the fifth greatest comic book film of all time . 
 The film won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film . In addition , Bryan Singer ( Direction ) , Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty ( Writing ) , and John Ottman ( Music ) all received nominations . It also received nominations for its costumes , makeup , special effects and DVD release , amounting to a total of eight nominations . The Political Film Society honored X2 in the categories of Human Rights and Peace , while the film was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation ( Long Form ) . 
 Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle was critical of the storyline , special effects and action scenes . Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal specifically referred to the film as " fast @-@ paced , slow @-@ witted " . Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post wrote " Of the many comic book superhero movies , this is by far the lamest , the loudest , the longest " .

 = Typhula quisquiliaris = 
 Typhula quisquiliaris , commonly known as the bracken club , is a species of club fungus in the family <unk> . It produces small , white fruit bodies up to 9 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) in height , each with a single distinct " head " and " stem " . The head is fertile , while the stem attaches to a sclerotium embedded in the substrate . The fruit bodies grow from dead wood , and strongly favours bracken , where the species feeds <unk> . Though T. quisquiliaris was described under a different name by James Sowerby in 1803 , the specific name quisquiliaris was sanctioned in 1821 by Elias Magnus Fries , and the species was moved to the genus Typhula , which resulted in its currently accepted binomial name by Paul Christoph Hennings in 1896 . The species has been recorded in Europe and north Africa . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Typhula quisquiliaris was first described by James Sowerby in 1803 as Clavaria obtusa . However , this name was found to be illegitimate , as it had already been given to a different species by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1797 . The species was given its sanctioned name several years later by Elias Magnus Fries , in his 1821 Systema Mycologicum . Fries named the species <unk> quisquiliaris , having previously ( in 1818 ) named it Clavaria quisquiliaris . The specific name quisquiliaris is from the Latin meaning " pertaining to refuse " . In the same year , Samuel Frederick Gray reclassified Sowerby 's Clavaria obtusa , naming it Geoglossum <unk> . Fries 's name was taken up as the valid one , however , and in 1896 , Paul Christoph Hennings transferred the species to Typhula , giving the species the name by which it is known today . However , the name <unk> quisquiliaris was sometimes used into the 20th century . For instance , Carleton Rea used it in a 1922 publication . The species is commonly known as the bracken club . 
 = = Description = = 
 Typhula quisquiliaris produces fruit bodies in the form of clubs . Each fruit body consists of a single distinct " stem " and " head " , and measures up to 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 3 in ) in height . The surface of the head is smooth and white , and measures 1 @.@ 5 to 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 06 to 0 @.@ 2 in ) by 1 to 2 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 04 to 0 @.@ 1 in ) . The rounded stem is infertile , and of a similar colour to the head . However , it has a very fine downy covering , and is somewhat translucent . The stem measures from 0 @.@ 3 to 0 @.@ 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 01 to 0 @.@ 02 in ) in width . The stem attaches to sclerotium which is buried into the branch from which the fruit body grows . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 Typhula quisquiliaris spores are narrowly ellipsoid , and measure from 9 to 14 by 4 to 5 @.@ 5 micrometres ( μm ) . The spores are white , and contain small granules . The spores are borne on basidia which measure 50 to 70 by 7 to 8 μm , with four spores on each basidium . The downy covering of the stem is made up of thick @-@ walled hairs , each measuring 15 to 60 by 3 to 7 μm , though they are often swollen towards the base . The sclerotium measures from 1 @.@ 5 to 3 by 0 @.@ 5 μm , and is a pale yellow colour . Clamp connections are present in the hyphae . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Typhula quisquiliaris fruit bodies are typically found in rows , growing from plant detritus . The species favours bracken , especially Pteridium aquilinum , but the colonisation of dead matter from other plants is not unknown . Upon these substrates , it feeds as a saprotroph , breaking down the dead organic matter in order to sustain itself . The species has been recorded in Europe and northern Africa . In Europe , the fruit bodies can be encountered from April to December . 
 = Saverne Tunnel = 
 The Saverne Tunnel ( French : Tunnel de Saverne ) , also known as the Ernolsheim @-@ lès @-@ Saverne Tunnel ( French : Tunnel d <unk> @-@ lès @-@ Saverne ) , is a twin @-@ bore , high @-@ speed rail tunnel in western Bas @-@ Rhin , France . It carries the LGV Est line of France 's TGV high @-@ speed rail network through the narrowest part of the Vosges mountain range , beneath Mont Saint @-@ Michel and adjacent to the Saverne Pass . The tunnel consists of two bores , containing one railroad track each , that are connected by passageways every 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) . The LGV Est crosses the 270 m ( 890 ft ) Haspelbaechel viaduct near the western end of the tunnel . The tunnel was excavated by a tunnel boring machine between November 2011 and February 2013 . Civil engineering work on the tunnel ended in April 2014 and it will open with the rest of the second phase of the LGV Est in July 2016 . The total cost of the tunnel was approximately € 200 million .

 The Saverne Tunnel was constructed as part of the second phase of the LGV Est <unk> ( often shortened to LGV Est ) . When completed , the line will connect Paris and Strasbourg — the principal city of the Alsace region and home to several European institutions , including the Council of Europe . The first phase across 300 kilometres ( 190 mi ) of relatively flat land from <unk> @-@ sur @-@ Marne ( near Paris ) to Baudrecourt ( near Metz and Nancy ) opened in 2007 . The second phase traverses 106 km ( 66 mi ) of rougher terrain from Baudrecourt to Vendenheim ( near Strasbourg ) . When opened , the line will reduce travel time between Paris and Strasbourg from <unk> to <unk> and reduce travel time from Luxembourg City to Strasbourg from <unk> to <unk> . The Saverne Tunnel crosses the northern Vosges at its narrowest point and is adjacent to the Saverne Pass , which already contains the A4 autoroute , Departmental Route 219 , and remnants of an ancient Roman road . 
 The line was originally built for Réseau Ferré de France ( RFF ) , which owned and operated the infrastructure of the French national railway network . In a government restructuring of the French railroad network , RFF was merged into SNCF on 1 January 2015 and is now a subdivision of SNCF known as SNCF Réseau .

 The tunnel was part of the Lot 47 segment of the LGV Est for the contracting and construction . Lot 47 consisted of the Saverne Tunnel , the adjacent Haspelbaechel viaduct , and an additional 3 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 1 mi ) of the LGV line through the communes of <unk> @-@ et @-@ Quatre @-@ Vents in Moselle and <unk> , Saint @-@ Jean @-@ Saverne , and Ernolsheim @-@ lès @-@ Saverne in Bas @-@ Rhin . In September 2010 , RFF awarded a € 184 @.@ 3 million design @-@ build contract for Lot 47 to a consortium of 13 companies , led by Dodin Campenon @-@ Bernard . The Saverne Tunnel was built by <unk> Batignolles and Dodin Campenon @-@ Bernard , at a cost of approximately € 200 million . 
 The two bores of the Saverne Tunnel were excavated with a 110 m ( 360 ft ) , 2 @,@ 200 @-@ tonne ( 2 @,@ 400 @-@ ton ) tunnel boring machine ( TBM ) , manufactured by <unk> . The TBM was used to excavate 3 @,@ 820 m ( 12 @,@ 530 ft ) of the 4 @,@ 200 m ( 13 @,@ 800 ft ) tunnel , the remainder consisting of false tunnel constructed at both ends . The TBM was christened Charlotte — in honor of a girl from a nearby village — in a ceremony on 25 October 2011 . It began excavation of the first bore on 10 November 2011 from the eastern side of Mont Saint @-@ Michel and completed the first bore over a month ahead of schedule on 19 June 2012 . For the first bore , 1932 rings were installed , using 15 @,@ 456 precast concrete lining segments ( 8 per ring ) . The TBM excavated 307 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 10 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of earth at an average speed of 20 m ( 66 ft ) per day . 
 Excavation of the second bore began on 26 September 2012 and finished on 25 February 2013 . The 730 @,@ 000 m3 ( 26 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of earth excavated during tunneling was used to construct embankments in nearby sections of the LGV Est line . In total , 30 @,@ 960 precast concrete lining segments were used . <unk> of the final interconnecting passage was completed on 24 June 2013 , marking the end of construction of the tunnel walls . On 14 April 2014 , civil engineering work on the tunnel was completed , but railroad signaling and equipment still needed to be installed . 
 Service on the LGV Est line was originally scheduled to begin on 3 April 2016 ; however , a fatal accident that occurred elsewhere on the new line in November 2015 during commissioning tests has delayed the scheduled opening of the line until 3 July 2016 .

 The tunnel lies beneath Mont Saint @-@ Michel , beside the Col de Saverne , and within the Northern Vosges Regional Nature Park , a Natura 2000 site . 
 It is located close to the border with the department of Moselle and within three communes of the department of Bas @-@ Rhin : <unk> , Saint @-@ Jean @-@ Saverne , Ernolsheim @-@ lès @-@ Saverne . 
 The tunnel is part of the LGV Est high @-@ speed rail line , which will connect Paris with Strasbourg . The line is also a part of the Main line for Europe trans @-@ European high @-@ speed rail line from Paris to Bratislava , Slovakia . 
 The tunnel is 4 @,@ 200 m ( 13 @,@ 800 ft ) in length and consists of two bores , each carrying one rail line flanked by a maintenance walkway and an emergency evacuation walkway . The two bores are connected every 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) by an interconnecting passage . The tunnel has been built for a maximum speed of 350 kilometres per hour ( 220 mph ) — 320 km / h ( 200 mph ) in commercial operation . It will be remotely monitored from the SNCF Réseau command center at <unk> @-@ sur @-@ Moselle . 
 Adjacent to the western portal , the LGV Est traverses the 270 m ( 890 ft ) Haspelbaechel viaduct , which travels up to 35 m ( 115 ft ) above the Haspelbaechel valley . 
 = Cyathus olla = 
 Cyathus olla is a species of saprobic fungus in the genus Cyathus , family Nidulariaceae . The fruit bodies resemble tiny bird 's nests filled with " eggs " – spore @-@ containing structures called peridioles . Like other bird 's nest fungi , C. olla relies on the force of falling water to dislodge peridioles from fruiting bodies to eject and disperse their spores . The life cycle of this fungus allows it to reproduce both sexually , with meiosis , and asexually via spores . C. olla is a relatively common fungus , with a worldwide distribution . It is the subject of agricultural research to determine its potential as a means to accelerate the breakdown of crop residue , and reduce the population of plant pathogens . The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word olla , meaning " pot " . 
 = = Description = = 
 Cyathus olla bears a resemblance to a miniature bird 's nest containing eggs , hence the common name bird 's nest fungi . The fruiting body , or peridium , is roughly funnel @-@ shaped , 10 – 18 mm tall and 8 – 12 mm wide . It is greyish yellow or greyish brown to fawn @-@ colored and covered with even , fine @-@ textured hairs on the outside surface . The inner surface is silver grey and smooth , often with faint transverse ridges . Cyathus olla is thick @-@ walled , and flared outwards at the rim ; the rim is typically wavy in outline . The ' eggs ' , or peridioles , typically number 8 to 10 in the cup , and they are white or grey in color , with a diameter of 2 – 4 mm — conspicuously larger than other Cyathus species . They are covered with a thin membrane called a tunica . Peridioles are often attached to the fruiting body by a funiculus , a structure of hyphae that is differentiated into three regions : the basal piece , which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium , the middle piece , and an upper sheath , called the purse , connected to the lower surface of the peridiole . Inside the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord , attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron . C. olla has a wide purse with an upper portion not easily distinguishable from the lower part . 
 A different form of this species , Cyathus olla forma anglicus , originally reported from England by mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd , has also been found in Oregon and Colorado in the USA , Alberta Canada , and in Argentina . This form is large , with cup openings up to 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) in diameter . Spores have dimensions of 11 @.@ 5 – 12 @.@ 5 × 7 @.@ 5 – 9 µm . 
 The related species Cyathus earlei Lloyd closely resembles C. olla , although mating analysis has shown that they are distinct species . 
 = = = Microscopic features = = = 
 Cyathus olla has ovate @-@ shaped spores with dimensions of 10 – 14 × 6 – 8 µm . In 1927 , George Willard Martin examined the microscopic features of various members of the Nidulariaceae family , including Cyathus olla . He noted that in this species , the basidia — spore @-@ bearing cells — are club @-@ shaped or cylindrical and have long stems , and they sometimes have a clamp connection at the basal end of the structure . Basidia typically hold between two and four sessile spores that are directly attached to the basidium , rather than via a sterigma . Revealed only after the spore is separated , a temporary apiculus marks the point of attachment . The spores are generally separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize ; this basidial breakdown typically occurs simultaneously with a gelatinization of cells lining the inside wall of the peridiole . After separating from the basidia the outer wall of the spores may thicken , although they generally do not increase in size . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Being a saprobic fungus , Cyathus olla obtains nutrients from the breakdown of dead organic matter , and as such is usually found growing on woody debris ; specimens found growing on soil are usually attached to bits of wood or stems present in the soil . Brodie notes that this species usually grows in moist and shaded locations , although its discovery in the arid regions of Lima , Peru , suggest that it is tolerant of low @-@ moisture conditions . It is the most abundant species of Cyathus found in Europe , and is also common in North America . Its range extends north to Sweden and far south in South America ; it has also been reported in Australia , South Africa , Iran , and India . 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 The life cycle of Cyathus olla , which contains both haploid and diploid stages , is typical of taxa in the basidiomycetes that can reproduce both asexually ( via vegetative spores ) , or sexually ( with meiosis ) . Basidiospores produced in the peridioles each contain a single haploid nucleus . After dispersal , the spores germinate and grow into homokaryotic hyphae , with a single nucleus in each compartment . When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another , they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy . After a period of time and under the appropriate environmental conditions , fruiting bodies may be formed from the dikaryotic mycelia . These fruiting bodies produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made . Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse , and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce haploid basidiospores . <unk> in C. olla has been found to be similar to that of higher organisms . 
 = = Spore dispersal = = 
 When a raindrop hits the interior of the cup with the proper angle and velocity it can produce considerable force , and can create a splash that drives the water up along the sides of the cup ( also known as splash cups ) , tearing the funiculus , and ejecting the peridioles . The peridioles are followed by their funicular cord and basal hapteron . When they hit a nearby plant stem or stick , the hapteron sticks to it , and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still @-@ moving peridiole ( similar to a tetherball ) . The peridiole , attached to the plant , may be eaten by herbivorous mammals , and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation . 
 Experiments investigating the splash dispersal of peridioles have shown a maximum horizontal distance for peridiole ejection of 82 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 32 @.@ 5 in ) , less than that observed for other Cyathus species . This reduced ejection distance may be due to such factors as the greater size of peridioles , the looser construction of the funiculus , or the increased flaring seen in the upper lip of the splash cup .

 <unk> is a fungal disease of canola that results in major yield loss in affected crops . It overwinters on infected stubble ( leftover crop residue ) that is left on farm fields , and can continue to produce spores , infecting future crops , until the stubble is buried or broken down completely . The observation that C. olla grows and fruits on canola stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade canola stubble , and reduce the incidence of stubble @-@ borne diseases like <unk> and blackspot . In a study of its lignin @-@ degrading abilities , C. olla was shown to colonize canola , wheat , and barley residue , but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of canola as compared to the cereal residue . 
 = Battle of Trenton = 
 The Battle of Trenton was a small but pivotal battle during the American Revolutionary War which took place on the morning of December 26 , 1776 , in Trenton , New Jersey . After General George Washington 's crossing of the Delaware River north of Trenton the previous night , Washington led the main body of the Continental Army against Hessian soldiers garrisoned at Trenton . After a brief battle , nearly the entire Hessian force was captured , with negligible losses to the Americans . The battle significantly boosted the Continental Army 's flagging morale , and inspired re @-@ enlistments . 
 The Continental Army had previously suffered several defeats in New York and had been forced to retreat through New Jersey to Pennsylvania . Morale in the army was low ; to end the year on a positive note , George Washington — Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Continental Army — devised a plan to cross the Delaware River on the night of December 25 – 26 and surround the Hessian garrison . 
 Because the river was icy and the weather severe , the crossing proved dangerous . Two detachments were unable to cross the river , leaving Washington with only 2 @,@ 400 men under his command in the assault . The army marched 9 miles ( 14 km ) south to Trenton . The Hessians had lowered their guard , thinking they were safe from the American army , and had no long @-@ distance outposts or patrols . Washington 's forces caught them off guard and , after a short but fierce resistance , most of the Hessians surrendered . Almost two thirds of the 1 @,@ 500 @-@ man garrison was captured , and only a few troops escaped across Assunpink Creek . 
 Despite the battle 's small numbers , the American victory inspired rebels in the colonies . With the success of the revolution in doubt a week earlier , the army had seemed on the verge of collapse . The dramatic victory inspired soldiers to serve longer and attracted new recruits to the ranks . 
 = = Background = = 
 In early December 1776 , American morale was very low . The Americans had been ousted from New York by the British and their Hessian auxiliaries , and the Continental Army was forced to retreat across New Jersey . Ninety percent of the Continental Army soldiers who had served at Long Island were gone . Men had deserted , feeling that the cause for independence was lost . Washington , Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Continental Army , expressed some doubts , writing to his cousin in Virginia , " I think the game is pretty near up . " 
 At the time a small town in New Jersey , Trenton was occupied by three regiments of Hessian soldiers commanded by Colonel Johann Rall , numbering about 1 @,@ 400 men . Washington 's force comprised 2 @,@ 400 men , with infantry divisions commanded by Major Generals Nathanael Greene and John Sullivan , and artillery under the direction of Brigadier General Henry Knox .

 = = = Intelligence = = = 
 Washington had stationed a spy named John Honeyman , posing as a Tory , in Trenton . Honeyman had served with Major General James Wolfe in Quebec at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham on September 13 , 1759 , and had no trouble establishing his credentials as a Tory . Honeyman was a butcher and weaver , who traded with the British and Hessians . This enabled him to gather intelligence , and also to convince the Hessians that the Continental Army was in such a low state of morale that they would not attack Trenton . Shortly before Christmas , he arranged to be captured by the Continental Army , who had orders to bring him to Washington unharmed . After being questioned by Washington , he was imprisoned in a small hut , to be tried as a Tory in the morning , but a small fire broke out nearby , enabling him to " escape . " 
 = = = American plan = = = 
 The American plan relied on launching coordinated attacks from three directions . General John Cadwalader would launch a diversionary attack against the British garrison at Bordentown , New Jersey , to block off reinforcements from the south . General James Ewing would take 700 militia across the river at Trenton Ferry , seize the bridge over the Assunpink Creek and prevent enemy troops from escaping . The main assault force of 2 @,@ 400 men would cross the river 9 mi ( 14 km ) north of Trenton and split into two groups , one under Greene and one under Sullivan , to launch a pre @-@ dawn attack . Sullivan would attack the town from the south , and Greene from the north . Depending on the success of the operation , the Americans would possibly follow up with separate attacks on Princeton and New Brunswick . 
 During the week before the battle , American advance parties began to ambush enemy cavalry patrols , capturing dispatch riders and attacking Hessian pickets . The Hessian commander , to emphasize the danger to his men , sent 100 infantry and an artillery detachment to deliver a letter to the British commander at Princeton . Washington ordered Ewing and his Pennsylvania militia to try to gain information on Hessian movements and technology . Ewing instead made three successful raids across the river . On December 17 and 18 , 1776 , they attacked an outpost of jägers and on the 21st , they set fire to several houses . Washington put constant watches on all possible crossings near the Continental Army encampment on the Delaware , as he believed William Howe would launch an attack from the north on Philadelphia if the river froze over . 
 On December 20 , 1776 , some 2 @,@ 000 troops led by General Sullivan arrived in Washington 's camp . They had been under the command of Charles Lee , and had been moving slowly through northern New Jersey when Lee was captured . That same day , an additional 800 troops arrived from Fort Ticonderoga under the command of Horatio Gates .

 On December 14 , 1776 , the Hessians arrived in Trenton to establish their winter quarters . At the time , Trenton was a small town with about 100 houses and two main streets , King ( now Warren ) Street and Queen ( now Broad ) Street . Carl von Donop , Rall 's superior , had marched south to Mount Holly on December 22 to deal with the resistance in New Jersey , and had clashed with some New Jersey militia there on December 23 . 
 Donop , who despised Rall , was reluctant to give command of Trenton to him . Rall was known to be loud and unacquainted with the English language , but he was also a 36 @-@ year soldier with a great deal of battle experience . His request for reinforcements had been turned down by British commander General James Grant , who disdained the American rebels and thought them poor soldiers . Despite Rall 's experience , the Hessians at Trenton did not admire their commander . They believed that he was too nice , and not ruthless enough to be successful . His officers complained , " His love of life was too great , a thought came to him , then another , so he could not settle on a firm decision ... " Rall avoided hard work and had little concern for his troops ' comfort . 
 Trenton lacked city walls or fortifications , which was typical of American settlements . Some Hessian officers advised Rall to fortify the town , and two of his engineers advised that a redoubt be constructed at the upper end of town , and fortifications be built along the river . The engineers went so far as to draw up plans , but Rall disagreed with them . When Rall was again urged to fortify the town , he replied , " Let them come ... We will go at them with the bayonet . " 
 As Christmas approached , Loyalists came to Trenton to report the Americans were planning action . American deserters told the Hessians that rations were being prepared for an advance across the river . Rall publicly dismissed such talk as nonsense , but privately in letters to his superiors , he said he was worried about an imminent attack . He wrote to Donop that he was " liable to be attacked at any moment " . Rall said that Trenton was " indefensible " and asked that British troops establish a garrison in Maidenhead ( now Lawrenceville ) . Close to Trenton , this would help defend the roads from Americans . His request was denied . As the Americans disrupted Hessian supply lines , the officers started to share Rall 's fears . One wrote , " We have not slept one night in peace since we came to this place . " On December 22 , 1776 , a spy reported to Grant that Washington had called a council of war ; Grant told Rall to " be on your guard " . 
 The main Hessian force of 1 @,@ 500 men was divided into three regiments : Knyphausen , Lossberg and Rall . That night , they did not send out any patrols because of the severe weather . 
 = = = Crossing and march = = = 
 Before Washington and his troops left , Benjamin Rush came to cheer up the General . While he was there , he saw a note Washington had written , saying , " Victory or Death " . Those words would be the password for the surprise attack . Each soldier carried 60 rounds of ammunition , and three days of rations . When the army arrived at the shores of the Delaware , they were already behind schedule , and clouds began to form above them . It began to rain . As the air 's temperature dropped , the rain changed to sleet , and then to snow . The Americans began to cross the river , with John Glover in command . The men went across in Durham boats , while the horses and artillery went across on large ferries . The 14th Continental Regiment of Glover manned the boats . During the crossing , several men fell overboard , including Colonel John Haslet . Haslet was quickly pulled out of the water . No one died during the crossing , and all the artillery pieces made it over in good condition . 
 Two small detachments of infantry of about 40 men each were ordered ahead of main columns . They set roadblocks ahead of the main army , and were to take prisoner whoever came into or left the town . One of the groups was sent north of Trenton , and the other was sent to block River Road , which ran along the Delaware River to Trenton . 
 The terrible weather conditions delayed the landings in New Jersey until 3 : 00 am ; the plan was that they were supposed to be completed by 12 : 00 am . Washington realized it would be impossible to launch a pre @-@ dawn attack . Another setback occurred for the Americans , as generals Cadwalader and Ewing were unable to join the attack due to the weather conditions . 
 At 4 : 00 am , the soldiers began to march towards Trenton . Along the way , several civilians joined as volunteers , and led as guides ( see Captain John Mott ) because of their knowledge of the terrain . After marching 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) through winding roads into the wind , they reached Bear Tavern , where they turned right . The ground was slippery , but it was level , making it easier for the horses and artillery . They began to make better time . They soon reached Jacobs Creek , where , with difficulty , the Americans made it across . The two groups stayed together until they reached Birmingham , where they split apart . Soon after , they reached the house of Benjamin Moore , where the family offered food and drink to Washington . At this point , the first signs of daylight began to appear . Many of the troops did not have boots , so they were forced to wear rags around their feet . Some of the men 's feet bled , turning the snow to a dark red . Two men died on the trip . 
 As they marched , Washington rode up and down the line , encouraging the men to continue . General Sullivan sent a courier to tell Washington that the weather was wetting his men 's gunpowder . Washington responded , " Tell General Sullivan to use the bayonet . I am resolved to take Trenton . " 
 About 2 miles ( 3 km ) outside the town , the main columns reunited with the advance parties . They were startled by the sudden appearance of 50 armed men , but they were American . Led by Adam Stephen , they had not known about the plan to attack Trenton , and had attacked a Hessian outpost . Washington feared the Hessians would have been put on guard , and shouted at Stephen , " You sir ! You Sir , may have ruined all my plans by having them put on their guard . " Despite this , Washington ordered the advance continue to Trenton . In the event , Rall thought the first raid was the attack which Grant had warned him about , and that there would be no further action that day . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = American attack = = = 
 At 8 am , the outpost was set up by the Hessians at a cooper shop on Pennington Road about one mile north @-@ west of Trenton . Washington led the assault , riding in front of his soldiers . As the Hessian commander of the outpost , Lieutenant Andreas Wiederholdt , left the shop , an American fired at him but missed . Wiederholdt shouted , " Der Feind ! " ( The Enemy ! ) and other Hessians came out . The Americans fired three volleys and the Hessians returned one of their own . Washington ordered Edward Hand 's Pennsylvania Riflemen and a battalion of German @-@ speaking infantry to block the road that led to Princeton . They attacked the Hessian outpost there . Wiederholdt soon realized that this was more than a raiding party ; seeing other Hessians retreating from the outpost , he led his men to do the same . Both Hessian detachments made organized retreats , firing as they fell back . On the high ground at the north end of Trenton , they were joined by a duty company from the Lossberg Regiment . They engaged the Americans , retreating slowly , keeping up continuous fire and using houses for cover . Once in Trenton , they gained covering fire from other Hessian guard companies on the outskirts of the town . Another guard company nearer to the Delaware River rushed east to their aid , leaving open the River Road into Trenton . Washington ordered the escape route to Princeton be cut off , sending infantry in battle formation to block it , while artillery formed at the head of King and Queen streets . 
 Leading the southern American column , General Sullivan entered Trenton by the abandoned river road and blocked the only crossing over the Assunpink Creek to cut off the Hessian escape . Sullivan briefly held up his advance to make sure Greene 's division had time to drive the Hessians from their outposts in the north . Soon after , they continued their advance , attacking the Hermitage , home of Philemon Dickinson , where 50 Jägers under the command of Lieutenant von <unk> were stationed . Lieutenant von <unk> brought 12 of his Jägers into action against the advanced guard , but had only advanced a few hundred yards when he saw a column of Americans advancing to the Hermitage . Pulling back to the Hessian barracks , he was joined by the rest of the Jägers . After the exchange of one volley , they turned and ran , some trying to swim across the creek , while others escaped over the bridge , which had not yet been cut off . The 20 British Dragoons also fled . As Greene and Sullivan 's columns pushed into the town , Washington moved to high ground north of King and Queens streets to see the action and direct his troops . By this time , American artillery from the other side of the Delaware River came into action , devastating the Hessian positions . 
 With the sounding alarm , the three Hessian regiments began to prepare for battle . The Rall regiment formed on lower King Street along with the Lossberg Regiment , while the Knyphausen Regiment formed at the lower end of Queen Street . Lieutenant Piel , Rall 's brigade adjutant , woke his commander , who found that the rebels had taken the " V " of the main streets of the town . This is where the engineers had recommended building a redoubt . Rall ordered his regiment to form up at the lower end of King Street , the Lossberg regiment to prepare for an advance up Queen Street , and the Knyphausen regiment to stand by as a reserve for Rall 's advance up King Street . 
 The American cannon stationed at the head of the two main streets soon came into action . In reply , Rall directed his regiment , supported by a few companies of the Lossberg regiment , to clear the guns . The Hessians formed ranks and began to advance up the street , but their formations were quickly broken by the American guns and fire from Mercer 's men who had taken houses on the left side of the street . Breaking ranks , the Hessians fled . Rall ordered two three @-@ pound cannon into action . After getting off six rounds each , within just a few minutes , half of the Hessians manning their guns were killed by the American cannon . After the men fled to cover behind houses and fences , their cannon were taken by the Americans . Following capture of the cannon , men under the command of George Weedon advanced down King Street . 
 On Queen Street , all Hessian attempts to advance up the street were repulsed by guns under the command of Thomas Forrest . After firing four rounds each , two more Hessian guns were silenced . One of Forrest 's Howitzers was put out of action with a broken axle . The Knyphausen Regiment became separated from the Lossberg and the Rall regiments . The Lossberg and the Rall fell back to a field outside town , taking heavy losses from grapeshot and musket fire . In the southern part of the town , Americans under command of Sullivan began to overwhelm the Hessians . John Stark led a bayonet charge at the Knyphausen regiment , whose resistance broke because their weapons would not fire . Sullivan led a column of men to block off escape of troops across the creek . 
 = = = Hessian resistance collapses = = = 
 The Hessians in the field attempted to reorganize , and make one last attempt to retake the town so they could make a breakout . Rall decided to attack the American flank on the heights north of the town . Rall yelled " Forward ! Advance ! Advance ! " , and the Hessians began to move , with the brigade 's band playing fifes , bugles and drums to help the Hessians ' spirit . 
 Washington , still on high ground , saw the Hessians approaching the American flank . He moved his troops to assume battle formation against the enemy . The two Hessian Regiments began marching toward King Street , but were caught in American fire that came at them from three directions . Some Americans had taken up defensive positions inside houses , reducing their exposure . Some civilians joined the fight against the Hessians . Despite this , they continued to push , recapturing their cannon . At the head of King Street , Knox saw the Hessians had retaken the cannon and ordered his troops to take them . Six men ran and , after a brief struggle , seized the cannon , turning them on the Hessians . With most of the Hessians unable to fire their guns , the attack stalled . The Hessians ' formations broke , and they began to scatter . Rall was mortally wounded . Washington led his troops down from high ground while yelling , " March on , my brave fellows , after me ! " Most of the Hessians retreated into an orchard , with the Americans in close pursuit . Quickly surrounded , the Hessians were offered terms of surrender , to which they agreed . 
 Although ordered to join Rall , the remains of the Knyphausen Regiment mistakenly marched in the opposite direction . They tried to escape across the bridge , but found it had been taken . The Americans quickly swept in , defeating a Hessian attempt to break through their lines . Surrounded by Sullivan 's men , the regiment surrendered , just minutes after the rest of the brigade . 
 = = = Casualties and Capture = = = 
 The Hessian forces lost 22 killed in action , 83 wounded , and 896 captured . The Americans suffered only two deaths from bare feet causing frostbite and five wounded from battle , including a near @-@ fatal wound to future president James Monroe . Other losses incurred by the Patriots due to exhaustion , exposure , and illness in the following days may have raised their losses above those of the Hessians . 
 The captured Hessians were sent to Philadelphia and later Lancaster . In 1777 they were moved to Virginia . Rall was mortally wounded and died later that day at his headquarters . All four Hessian colonels in Trenton were killed in the battle . The Lossberg regiment was effectively removed from the British forces . Parts of the Knyphausen regiment escaped to the south , but Sullivan captured some 200 additional men , along with the regiment 's cannon and supplies . They also captured approximately 1 @,@ 000 arms and much @-@ needed ammunition . Last , but not least , was the capture from the Hessians their entire store of provisions — tons of flour , dried and salted meats , ale and other liquors , but also shoes , boots , clothing and bedding — things that were as much needed by the ragtag Continental forces as weapons and horses .

 An officer in Washington 's staff wrote before the battle , " They make a great deal of Christmas in Germany , and no doubt the Hessians will drink a great deal of beer and have a dance to @-@ night . They will be sleepy to @-@ morrow morning . " Popular history commonly portrays the Hessians as drunk from Christmas celebrations . However , historian David Hackett Fischer quotes Patriot John Greenwood , who fought in the battle and supervised Hessians afterward , who wrote , " I am certain not a drop of liquor was drunk during the whole night , nor , as I could see , even a piece of bread eaten . " Military historian Edward G. Lengel wrote , " The Germans were dazed and tired but there is no truth to the legend claiming that they were helplessly drunk . " 
 = = = After effect = = = 
 After the Hessians ' surrender , Washington is reported to have shook the hand of a young officer and said , " This is a glorious day for our country . " On December 28 . General Washington interviewed Lieutenant ( later Colonel ) Andreas <unk> , who detailed the failures of <unk> 's preparation . Washington soon learned however that Cadwalader and Ewing had been unable to complete their crossing , leaving his worn @-@ out army of 2 @,@ 400 men isolated . Without their 2 @,@ 600 men , Washington realized he did not have the forces to attack Princeton and New Brunswick . 
 This small but decisive battle , as with the later Battle of Cowpens , had an effect disproportionate to its size . The colonial effort was galvanized , and the Americans overturned the psychological dominance achieved by the British Government troops in the previous months . Howe was stunned that the Patriots so easily surprised and overwhelmed the Hessian garrison . On the contrary , Fischer argues that the changing attitudes were buoyed more by writings of Thomas Paine and additional successful actions by the New Jersey Militia than they were by the Battle of Trenton . 
 = = Aftermath and legacy = = 
 By noon , Washington 's force had moved across the Delaware back into Pennsylvania , taking their prisoners and captured supplies with them . This battle gave the Continental Congress a new confidence , as it proved colonial forces could defeat regulars . It also increased re @-@ enlistments in the Continental Army forces . By defeating a European army , the colonials reduced the fear which the Hessians had caused earlier that year after the fighting in New York . 
 Two notable American officers were wounded : William Washington , cousin of the General , and Lieutenant James Monroe , the future President of the United States . Monroe was carried from the field bleeding badly after he was struck in the left shoulder by a musket ball , which severed an artery . Doctor John Riker clamped the artery , preventing him from bleeding to death . 
 The hours before the battle served as the inspiration for the painting Washington Crossing the Delaware by German American artist Emanuel <unk> . The image in the painting , in which Washington stands majestic in his boat as it crosses the Delaware River , is generally believed to be more symbolic than historically accurate . The waters of the river were icy and treacherous , and the flag Monroe holds was not created until six months after the battle . In addition , contrary to the painting , the crossing occurred before dawn . On the other hand , Fischer argues that because the crossing took place in a storm , people may have stood to avoid sitting in icy water in the boats . Because of its emotional content , the painting has become an icon of American history . 
 The Trenton Battle Monument , erected at " Five Points " in Trenton , stands as a tribute to this American victory . The crossing of the Delaware and battle are reenacted by local enthusiasts every year ( unless the weather is too severe on the river ) . 
 Eight current Army National Guard units ( 101st Eng Bn , 103rd Eng Bn , A / 1 @-@ 104th Cav , 111th Inf , 125th QM Co , 175th Inf , 181st Inf and 198th Sig Bn ) and one currently @-@ active Regular Army Artillery battalion ( 1 – 5th FA ) are derived from American units that participated in the Battle of Trenton . There are only thirty current units of the U.S. Army with colonial roots .

 = Typhoon Chan @-@ hom ( 2015 ) = 
 Typhoon Chan @-@ hom , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Falcon , was a large and long @-@ lived tropical cyclone that affected most countries in the western Pacific basin . The ninth named storm of the 2015 Pacific typhoon season , Chan @-@ hom developed on June 29 from a westerly wind burst that also spawned Tropical Cyclone Raquel in the southern hemisphere . Chan @-@ hom slowly developed while moving to the northwest , aided by warm waters but disrupted by wind shear . The storm meandered near the Northern Marianas Islands , passing over the island of Rota before beginning a steady northwest track . While near the island , the storm dropped heavy rainfall on neighboring Guam , causing flooding and minor power outages . Chan @-@ hom intensified into a typhoon on July 7 , and two days later passed between the Japanese islands of Okinawa and Miyako @-@ jima . There , strong winds left 42 @,@ 000 people without power , while 27 people were injured . Around that time , the storm caused a surge in the monsoon trough , in conjunction with Tropical Storm Linfa , which caused flooding and killed 16 people in the Philippines . 
 After passing by Okinawa , the typhoon reached peak winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , according to the Japan Meteorological Agency . It passed north of Taiwan , where it brought beneficial rainfall that replenished reservoirs . On July 11 , Chan @-@ hom became the strongest typhoon to make landfall in the Chinese province of Zhejiang . About 1 @.@ 1 million people were evacuated ahead of the storm , and across the country , the storm left ¥ 9 @.@ 8 billion ( US $ 1 @.@ 5 billion ) in damage , as well as one death . Later , the storm turned to the northeast toward the Korean Peninsula . Jeju Island offshore South Korea recorded 1 @,@ 250 mm ( 49 in ) of rainfall , and one person died due to a thunderstorm in the country . On July 12 , the storm struck the <unk> peninsula in North Korea , and became an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter . The remnants later caused flooding and power outages in the Russian Far East . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 During June 2015 , a near record strength pulse in the Madden – Julian oscillation , lead to a period of significant weather across the Western Pacific . This significant weather included a major westerly wind burst during late June , which caused a set of twin tropical cyclones to develop . The first tropical cyclone developed in the Southern Hemisphere during June 28 , before it later developed into Tropical Cyclone Raquel during June 30 . The second tropical cyclone was first noted by the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) as a tropical disturbance during June 25 , while it was located about 345 km ( 215 mi ) to the south @-@ southeast of Pohnpei State in the Federated States of Micronesia . 
 Drifting generally northward , the disturbance slowly organized within a region of low to moderate wind shear and favorable outflow aloft . The circulation was enhanced by a surge of westerly winds to the south . At 06 : 00 UTC on June 29 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the system as a tropical depression . Following further organization , the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert that day at 22 : 30 UTC with the system located about 345 km ( 215 mi ) northeast of Pohnpei . Convection steadily deepened over the center and banding features began consolidating around the periphery . On June 30 , the JMA upgraded the cyclone to Tropical Storm Chan @-@ hom . The JTWC assessed Chan @-@ hom to be slightly weaker at this time , initiating it as a tropical depression . 
 Situated along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge , Chan @-@ hom moved steadily to the west . Upper @-@ level ventilation allowed for growth of the cyclone , but moderate wind shear displaced the center from the deepest convection for much of July 1 . That day , the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm . Early on July 2 , the large circulation of Chan @-@ hom absorbed a smaller disturbance to its southeast , and the storm turned to the west @-@ southwest . Dvorak satellite classifications indicated that the system reached typhoon intensity following an expansion of the central dense overcast ; the JTWC classified Chan @-@ hom as such by 15 : 00 UTC , although the JMA maintained it as a severe tropical storm . Shortly thereafter , strong wind shear from a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough ( TUTT ) cell to the northeast dramatically weakened the storm . Convection was stripped away from Chan @-@ hom 's center and the storm 's forward motion abruptly slowed . Alongside the shear , subsidence over the cyclone , a trough to the north , and a remnant vortex to the northeast all served to suppress convection . By 12 : 00 UTC on July 3 , Chan @-@ hom had weakened to a tropical storm with winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) . 
 Coinciding with Chan @-@ hom 's abrupt collapse on July 3 , the system turned northeast as it entered a weakness in the steering ridge . Later that day , the broad circulation turned north @-@ northwest . Wind shear eased early on July 4 as the TUTT cell retreated to the north and the subtropical ridge steadily re @-@ established itself . Convection started redeveloping over the tropical storm . Late on July 4 into July 5 , the center of Chan @-@ hom skirted the southern coast of Rota in the Mariana Islands . While near the island , Chan @-@ hom executed an unusual counter @-@ clockwise loop owing to interaction with a monsoon trough . Once clear of the Mariana Islands , steady development ensued owing to low wind shear and good outflow . Early on July 7 , Chan @-@ hom attained typhoon intensity according to the JMA , following to a burst in central convection . Microwave satellite imagery indicated the formation of an eye as convection deepened and banding features tightened around the circulation . 
 On July 7 , the typhoon entered the Philippine area of Responsibility and was assigned the local name Falcon . Chan @-@ hom 's eye briefly improved in structure before entering a state of flux and collapsing later that day ; convection on the northern side of the storm diminished simultaneously . The 65 km ( 40 mi ) wide eye soon re @-@ established itself and slowly contracted to a diameter of 40 km ( 25 mi ) by July 8 . A large storm , gale @-@ force winds extended 445 km ( 275 mi ) from Chan @-@ hom 's center on July 9 . Late on July 9 into July 10 , Chan @-@ hom passed between the Japanese islands of Okinawa and Miyako @-@ jima . The typhoon reached its peak strength during this time with estimated winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) and a barometric pressure of 935 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 61 inHg ) . Featuring multiple intense feeder bands and a well @-@ defined 27 km ( 17 mi ) eye , the JTWC assessed Chan @-@ hom to have peaked as a Category 4 @-@ equivalent typhoon on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale with one @-@ minute sustained winds of 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) . 
 An eyewall replacement cycle and weakening convection along the northern side resulted in steady weakening starting on July 10 . Increasing wind shear prevented the system from reorganizing as it neared East China . Early on July 11 , the typhoon reached the southwestern edge of the subtropical ridge and began turning to the north and later north @-@ northeast . Chan @-@ hom made landfall in Zhoushan , Zhejiang , or roughly 140 km ( 80 mi ) south @-@ southeast of Shanghai , around 08 : 40 UTC . The JMA assessed the storm to have had winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) while the JTWC estimated one @-@ minute sustained winds at 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) . Based on the JTWC estimate , Chan @-@ hom was the strongest typhoon to pass within 160 km ( 100 mi ) of Shanghai in at least 35 years , and it was the strongest landfall in Zhejiang since recordkeeping began in 1949 . Thereafter the storm accelerated north @-@ northeast and moved over the cool waters of the Yellow Sea , prompting further degradation of its structure . Chan @-@ hom weakened below typhoon @-@ force around 18 : 00 UTC on July 11 . The system 's low @-@ level center completely exposed on July 12 as it approached the Korean Peninsula . Around 18 : 00 UTC , Chan @-@ hom moved ashore on the <unk> peninsula in North Korea , southwest of the capital Pyongyang , with winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) . By 00 : 00 UTC on July 13 the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while retaining gale @-@ force winds , and six hours later the system dissipated over north @-@ central North Korea .

 Due to the typhoon , about 1 @.@ 1 million people evacuated from areas along the coast . Nearly 30 @,@ 000 ships were called back to port , and 600 flights were canceled within the area . Over 100 train rides were also canceled , and portions of the Shanghai Metro was shut down . The storm caused a concert for Chinese singer Wang Feng to be canceled . 
 While moving over eastern China , Chan @-@ hom produced sustained winds of 119 km / h ( 74 mph ) and gusts to 177 km / h ( 110 mph ) , both at a station south of Shanghai called <unk> . Shanghai Pudong International Airport recorded wind gusts of 90 km / h ( 56 mph ) . Gusts were strongest along the coast and along offshore islands . Rainfall from the storm peaked at 531 mm ( 20 @.@ 9 in ) in Yuyao , <unk> , and <unk> , all parts of Ningbo city within Zhejiang . The rains caused widespread flooding in eastern China ; 11 rivers in Zhejiang surpassed the warning level of 1 @.@ 91 m ( 6 @.@ 3 ft ) . The storm produced high waves from Fujian to Jiangsu provinces , reaching five storeys high in Wenling , washing fish ashore and flooding the coast . 
 Winds from Chan @-@ hom were strong enough to knock down street signs across Zhejiang , as well as destroying an unoccupied building in Cixi City . The storm 's heavy rainfall caused a landslide in Ningbo and necessitated flood gates to be opened . Also in the city , storm rains caused a hotel roof to collapse , killing one person and injuring two . Throughout Zhejiang , Chan @-@ hom wrecked 700 homes and damaged another 1 @,@ 400 . In neighboring Jiangsu , 300 homes were damaged or destroyed , causing ¥ 120 million ( US $ 19 million ) in economic losses . The storm wrecked greenhouses and irrigation systems while also damaging crops . Storm impacts mostly affected agriculture and transportation in the country ; over 200 @,@ 000 ha ( 490 @,@ 000 acres ) of crop fields were impacted . In the <unk> District of Shanghai , 20 % of peaches and 40 % of pears were lost after being damaged by the storm 's winds . In Shanghai , the winds knocked down over 3 @,@ 000 trees . The high agriculture damage – estimated at ¥ 3 @.@ 62 billion ( US $ 550 million ) – was mostly due to the typhoon 's concurrence with the local harvesting of vegetables and melons . Overall , Chan @-@ hom affected 3 @.@ 9 million people in eastern China , causing about ¥ 9 @.@ 8 billion ( US $ 1 @.@ 5 billion ) in damage .

 Before the storm affected the Marianas Islands , the National Weather Service issued a typhoon watch and tropical storm warning for Guam and Rota , as well as a typhoon warning for Tinian , and Saipan . The United States Department of Defense issued a Condition of Readiness 3 . While looping near Rota , Chan @-@ hom produced gusts of 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) . On the other side of the Rota Channel , Andersen Air Force Base on northern Guam recorded wind gusts of 117 km / h ( 72 mph ) . Rainfall on the island totaled over 300 mm ( 12 in ) , based on radar estimates from the University of Guam , and possibly as high as 410 mm ( 16 in ) . On Guam , the storm caused minor power outages and flooding . 
 Although Chan @-@ hom did not directly affect the Philippines , both Chan @-@ hom and Tropical Storm Linfa enhanced the monsoon for several days , which caused severe flooding throughout the country . Heavy rains impacted portions of Luzon and the Western Visayas , with various events resulting in five deaths . Four people also went missing when their boat sank amid strong winds off the coast of Pangasinan . A brief tornado caused minor damage in Iba , Zambales . Nearly 34 @,@ 000 people were affected by the monsoon event , which killed 16 people and caused ₱ 3 @.@ 9 million ( US $ 86 @,@ 500 ) in agricultural losses . 
 On July 9 , the outer rainbands of Chan @-@ hom began affecting the Japanese island of Okinawa . Between July 9 and 10 , 326 flights were canceled at Naha Airport , affecting more than 32 @,@ 000 people . A total of 176 people sought refuge in public shelters . American military bases on the island were placed under Condition of Readiness 1 , the highest level . Early on July 10 , a station near the southern end of Okinawa recorded peak wind gusts of 179 @.@ 6 km / h ( 111 @.@ 6 mph ) , along with sustained winds of 118 @.@ 8 km / h ( 73 @.@ 8 mph ) . Strong winds affected other Japanese islands in the region , and Miyako @-@ jima recorded peak gusts of 118 @.@ 8 km / h ( 73 @.@ 8 mph ) . The storm dropped heavy rainfall , peaking at 230 mm ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) in Nago , Okinawa . At the height of the storm , 42 @,@ 000 people lost power across Okinawa Prefecture . The storm injured 27 people in Okinawa , three seriously . Two buildings were damaged . Agricultural damage across Okinawa reached ¥ 524 million ( US $ 4 @.@ 2 million ) , most of which was sustained by the mango crop . 
 Passing north of Taiwan , the threat of Chan @-@ hom caused the Taiwan Stock Exchange and other public buildings to close , as well as canceling several flights . The storm brought ultimately heavy rainfall , reaching 388 @.@ 5 mm ( 15 @.@ 30 in ) in Taipei . The Shihmen Dam , which had dropped to 55 % capacity before the storm , rose to 90 @.@ 26 % of its capacity due to the storm 's rains . 
 In South Korea , 574 flights were canceled and 163 boats were forced to remain at port . The large circulation of the storm dropped heavy rainfall throughout the Korean Peninsula , beneficial in easing drought conditions . Notably , Mount Halla on the offshore Jeju Island recorded 1 @,@ 250 mm ( 49 in ) of rainfall during Chan @-@ hon 's passage . Wind gusts reached 76 km / h ( 47 mph ) in <unk> County in southwestern South Korea . Thunderstorms killed one person in the country .

The storm dropped heavy rainfall , reaching over 300 mm ( 12 in ) in North Hamgyong Province along the east coast . Flooding was limited , as most of the country received about 102 mm ( 4 @.@ 0 in ) of rainfall from the storm . 
 The remnants of Chan @-@ hom later impacted southern areas of Khabarovsk Krai , producing heavy rain and high winds , peaking at 79 km / h ( 49 mph ) . The winds downed numerous trees , some of which fell on cars , and uprooted tombs in a graveyard in Khabarovsk . The towns of <unk> , Sovetskaya Gavan , and Vyazma , saw 40 to 80 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 to 3 @.@ 1 in ) of rain or roughly 60 – 70 percent of their average monthly precipitation for July during the storm 's passage .

 = = Creation and introduction = = 
 Home and Away was created by Alan Bateman . His inspiration developed after witnessing a foster home being built in a remote town in New South Wales and the locals opposing the idea of " degenerate kids running riot " . Bateman thought it would create a good basis for a new television series . Home and Away initially focuses Pippa ( Vanessa Downing ) and Tom Fletcher ( Roger Oakley ) on who move to the rural town of Summer Bay with their five foster children – one of these being Frank . Over three hundred young actors auditioned for the roles of the foster children . Bateman said that the foster children were played by professional actors and not just model types . 
 The cast filmed the pilot in 1987 . Papps ' casting was announced ahead of the series debut . The series first aired on 17 January 1988 on the Seven Network . Frank was the first character to appear , although a Police officer ( Bruce Venables ) spoke the first piece of dialogue . Frank was played by Bradley Pilato in the scene , which was set in 1978 as a young Frank tries to escape from the Police officer . The series then switches to 1988 , where Frank is one of five foster children alongside Carly Morris ( Sharyn Hodgson ) , Steven Matheson ( Adam Willits ) , Lynn Davenport ( Helena <unk> ) and Sally Fletcher ( Kate Ritchie ) . Tom loses his job in the city and moves the Fletcher family to the town of Summer Bay .

 In Frank 's backstory , he is a product of a broken home , born to a criminal father and an alcoholic mother . His father was sent to prison and his mother became incapable of looking after him . As a result , Frank became wayward , but that changed after he was fostered by Pippa and Tom . Frank 's ethnicity is Greek Australian ; and he fills the role of the serial 's first heart @-@ throb . He is characterised as having " streetwise ways " and a " disarming smile " . Frank has rock and roll ambitions because he has never been academically successful .

 In <unk> Desmond 's Home and Away Annual , he is described as being " coaxed away from a life of crime " by Tom and Pippa . Frank enjoys a " relatively stable home life " which they provide for him . In his book Home and Away Special , said that Frank had was " streetwise " by the age of eight , when he first " fell afoul of the law " . Papp 's mullet hair style became a trademark of Frank . Papps said that it was fashionable at the time and while he had originally sported the style for a previous project , it " evolved into the Home and Away mullet " . Papps told Clayden that Frank was so ignorant that at times he wanted to " shake him " .

 Frank is given a love interest in the form of Roo Stewart ( Justine Clarke ) . In the storyline Roo becomes pregnant by Brett Macklin ( Gerry Sont ) and tells Frank that he is the father . The character fills the role of " the bitch " and the storyline turned Roo into a public hate figure . While doing promotional events , Clarke was called a " slut " for Roo 's deception of Frank . Clarke had tried to lead a normal life away from filming , she even left her home phone number in the telephone directory . She was forced to change her number after fans repeatedly rang her asking how Frank was and what would happen next in their storyline . 
 Frank and Roo decide to get married because she is pregnant . Downing said that the serial was approaching sex before marriage in a liberal way . The writers dealt with it " sensibly " because Frank and Roo make up their own minds . She added that it was important to let teenagers show their maturity if they want to marry . Roo keeps her baby 's paternity a secret until the wedding day . In the middle of exchanging vows , Roo decides to be honest and tells Frank the truth . A wedding scenario had been planned for Roo , by the serial 's writing team from the off @-@ set . Bateman said that the wedding was not just to attract more viewers . He opined that people think that weddings were always based on the " consummation of love " . Roo and Frank 's wedding highlighted that it does not always work that way . The wedding episode resulted in a ratings boost and heightened media interest for Home and Away . Magazines and newspapers labelled it as a " shotgun wedding " . Frank and Roo 's wedding storyline was also covered by TV Week as their main story . Papps and Clarke were the first ever Home and Away cast members to feature on the cover of the magazine . Papps told J Clayden that Frank would never get over Roo lies about the baby 's father . When Frank learns the truth , he leaves Roo at the altar . He then crashes his car and which leaves Frank in a coma . 
 " Instead of saying ' I do ' when she walked down the aisle with Frank , she said , ' I can 't ; it 's not your baby . ' He ran out of the church , got in the car and drove off a ravine . " 
 When Roo gives birth to Martha ( Burcin Kapkin ) prematurely she calls out Frank ’ s name . It was a " poignant moment " , of which Clarke said " Roo wants him because she is still in love with him . But it is here she finds out that Bobby Simpson ( Nicolle Dickson ) and Frank are together . " Roo cannot handle Frank moving on with Bobby and Clarke added that Roo would do anything to be with Frank again .

 When Bobby 's friend Alan Fisher ( Simon Kay ) dies , it has an upsetting effect Bobby . Papps told J Clayden that " When Alan is dying ; Frank sees a sensitive side to Bobby which he likes . They 've always been close . " Frank later begins a relationship with Bobby ; Papps thought that his character 's romance with Bobby was more genuine than the one he shared with Roo . Dickson told Catherine Maloney from TV Guide that she was nervous about Bobby and Frank 's first kiss . She explained that she had not kissed anyone in the business before and was fretting while filming . Papps told Dickson : " Shut up and kiss me " and they played out the start of their characters romance . The actress stated that her character just puts on a " tough exterior " but longs for somebody . She added that during the storyline , viewers had sided with Bobby and not Roo . 
 The serial 's writers decided that Frank and Bobby should marry ; but were unsure how viewers would react . Papps and Dickson embarked on a promotional event in a shopping centre . Their presence attracted crowds and Papps shouted " let 's have a scream from those who want Bobby and Frank to marry " . The crowds went " berserk " and voiced their approval – which gave the go ahead for their on @-@ screen marriage plans . The storyline played out on @-@ screen when Frank decides that he should ask Bobby to marry him , despite still feeling hurt by Roo 's actions . He picks Bobby up from school wearing a tuxedo in a Rolls @-@ Royce and takes her to a picnic in the woods . He sets up a meal of fish and chips . Frank proposes and says ; " I can 't offer you a Rolls @-@ Royce lifestyle but you can have a life of fish and chips with me . " Frank also writes a song titled " When Best Friends Fall in Love " and this was played during the scenes . They later face problems and Frank takes Bobby to his childhood home and he explains to her about how important marriage is to him . In the episode Frank also has flashbacks of his childhood ; in which he was played by Michael <unk> . Dickson told J Clayden that everyone wants her character to attend University and " Bobby knows that getting married isn 't the right thing to do [ ... ] but she doesn 't want to lose Frank . " 
 Papps revealed to a reporter from TV Life that he would never marry as young as Frank did . While he told Eithne Power of TVTimes that he thought Frank and Bobby rushed into marriage without any " proper understanding of each other " . Frank thinks that marriage is a partnership where he will be " strong , the big provider and the breadwinner " . Papps said that it was a " chauvinist view " but due to his childhood he wants the option of security . Papps said that Bobby wants the same because of her bad childhood , but they both " approach marriage from different angles . Dickson agreed and admitted that there were times she wanted to scream at Bobby and tell her to " get her act together " where their marriage is concerned . Frank later decides to comfort Roo when Brett blackmails her to get access to Martha . Bobby becomes jealous and paranoid . Dickson said that " Bobby has caught Frank on the rebound , and she knows it . Frank is the closest thing poor Bobby has ever had " . Tom thinks that their marriage was a mistake , Dickson said that " deep down " Bobby knows that is too young , but she is a character " who can 't be told " .

 Papps decided to leave Home and Away to join the cast of The Flying Doctors ; but he was still contracted until to appear as Frank until May 1989 . The actor told TV Guide 's Maloney that he would miss his fellow cast members the most because he had become very close to them . However added that he was looking forward to a " less hectic work schedules and a change of routine " . He later told Desmond that " the danger in staying in soap too long is that people start seeing you as that character . " Dickson revealed that the rest of the cast were behind the idea of Frank 's exit storyline . They did not want him to be killed off because that would have been " too boring " . She added that the serial 's producer accepted their idea of Frank leaving " with a bang " . 
 In 1991 , Papps reprised the role for four weeks . Franks return with the build @-@ up to Home and Away 's annual " cliff @-@ hanger " episode . The storyline featured Frank 's attempts to win Bobby back . However , she is now engaged to Greg Marshall ( Ross Newton ) . Dickson told Robyn Willis of The Sun @-@ Herald that choosing between Frank and Greg is a " difficult decision " for Bobby . Dickson added that her character is " split in half " because for different reasons , one half of her wants to be with Frank , while the other wants to be with Greg . 
 In 2000 , Papps filmed a guest appearance as Frank , which sees him attend the wedding of his foster sister , Sally . Papps returned once again in 2002 as part of a special fourteenth anniversary storyline . In 2010 , Papps joined the serial 's writing team . He said that he enjoyed writing for the character of Roo , who was reintroduced into the series . He also remained open minded about Frank returning to the series .

 Lucy Clark of The Sun @-@ Herald said that Frank was " a bit of a <unk> " and correctly predicted that he would " become a childhood sweetheart of teenage girls across the country " . Michael Quin of the Melbourne Weekly said that Papps will always be remembered to " legions of Australian girls " as " Frank Morgan : the hot guy with the mullet " . Robin Oliver writing for The Sydney Morning Herald said that Frank was Home and Away 's " good @-@ looking young hero " . Linda <unk> and Ben Doherty of The Newcastle Herald summed Frank up as " the bloke who married tomboy Bobby after he left Roo at the altar , after he recovered from a serious car accident that left him in a coma at a general hospital and before he ran off to the States for a sea change . " Doherty also named Frank an " old favourite " of the series . Although Matt Buchanan from The Sydney Morning Herald admitted that he could not remember the name of the character that Papps " once pretended to be " . Helen Mitchell of the Evening Times said that " hunky Frank " was Home and Away 's answer to Michael J. Fox and " the local heart @-@ throb " . 
 Eamonn McCusker of The Digital Fix said that Frank was a " decent @-@ but @-@ dim sort of man " . He thought that Frank made a habit of walking down the aisle . McCusker also opined that the serial 's romances were " relatively straightforward affairs " ; but thought all that changed with the Frank / Roo / Bobby storyline . A columnist from TV Life said that Papps was the " resident heart @-@ throb " and Frank did not have a problem free life and was much " better at guitar than academic work " . Sinead O 'Neil from The Sun said that getting " ditched not hitched " was a classic soap cliff @-@ hanger and included Frank and Roo 's wedding on their list . 
 A writer from Inside Soap included Frank and Roo 's " shotgun wedding " in their " great moments in soap " feature . They opined that " it was destined to be the wedding from hell " and noted that it " certainly went with a blast " . The writer added that nothing could have made the wedding more entertaining because it had " a congregation of jilted ex @-@ lovers , an illegitimate child and a very dodgy motor . " A fellow columnist from Inside Soap later named Frank 's proposal of marriage to Bobby as " golden moment in soap " . They said that " there was never a soap romance more turbulent as Frank Morgan and Bobby Simpson 's " .

 The role made Papps a favourite with the viewers , won him many fans and made him famous . The Seven Network received fan mail for Papps before the series even debuted . While interviewed in 1989 , Papps explained that he would never admit to being the " sex symbol " that he was labelled as . He thought it was " nice to be loved and accepted " but the fame the role generated became an " intrusion " on his privacy . He told TVTimes ' Power that he could not relate to the perception of him and added " I know who I am and I 'm not the person hyped out there " . 
 Papps was still recognised as Frank in public twenty years later , despite mainly playing the role in his teenage years . Papps told Kate Ritchie on Nova 93 @.@ 7 , that the attention he received from Home and Away fans " wasn 't as mental as people would like to think " .

 = Battle of Barry = 
 The Battle of Barry is a legendary battle in which the Scots , purportedly led by Malcolm II , defeated a Danish invasion force in 1010 AD . Its supposed site in Carnoustie , Angus can be seen in early Ordnance Survey maps . The history of the event relies heavily on tradition and it is currently considered to be apocryphal . The battle was named for the Parish of Barry , rather than the village , and was formerly thought to have taken place at the mouth of the Lochty burn , in the vicinity of the area that is now occupied by Carnoustie High Street . While the battle is not historically authentic , its romantic appeal continues to capture the popular imagination . 
 = = Account of battle = = 
 The account of the battle was first recorded by sixteenth century Scots historian , Hector Boece . 
 Boece informs us that <unk> , king of Denmark and England , unhappy with news of his army 's defeat at Mortlach , ordered a naval task force to set sail for Scotland . Part of the force was to sail from Denmark , and the rest from the Thames , both under the command of Camus . 
 According to the legendary account , the army camped at St <unk> 's Head for several days before sailing north , landing at Lunan Bay in Angus . After sacking Montrose , the Army headed inland and razed the town of Brechin to the ground . Camus received word that King Malcolm II had brought the Scots army to Dundee and ordered the Danish army to march South , reaching the coast near to <unk> . The Scots army set camp at Barry , two miles to the West . 
 The two sides met and fought in the vicinity of the Lochty Burn , near where Carnoustie town centre now lies . The fighting is said to have been so fierce that the Lochty burn ran red with the blood of the fallen . 
 Seeing that the battle was lost , Camus fled to the hills , pursued by Robert de Keith ( purported ancestor of the <unk> of Scotland ) , who caught up with and slew him at Brae Downie where , it is said , the Camus Cross ( NO <unk> ) was erected in memory of him . 
 Afterwards King Malcolm is said to have dipped his fingers in Camus ' blood and ran them along the top of Robert 's shield , thus creating the red and gold striped design still used today in the Keith coat of arms . 
 = = Evidence of battle = = 
 = = = Written record = = = 
 The first record of the battle can be found in Hector Boece 's Historia Gentis Scotorum , written in 1527 . Boece 's work was popularised following a fairly free translation by John Bellenden into Scots in 1536 , and its subsequent translation into English by Raphael Holinshed ca . 1580 . No record of the battle is found before Boece . 
 While George Buchanan ( ca . 1579 ) also mentions the battle in his work Rerum <unk> Historia , his account borrows liberally from Boece . Boece is thought to have based much of his work on John of Fordun 's , Chronica Gentis Scotorum ( ca . 1360 ) . Fordun briefly mentions a battle at Mortlach but makes no mention of any at Barry : 
 Malcolm , thinking over the manifold blessings continually bestowed upon him by God , pondered anxiously in his mind what he should give Him in return . At length , the grace of the Holy Ghost working within him , he set his heart upon increasing the worship of God ; so he established a new episcopal see at <unk> ( Mortlach ) , not far from the spot where he had overcome the Norwegians , and gained the victory ; and endowed it with churches , and the rents of many estates . 
 It is possible that Fordun 's account of the Battle of Mortlach is due to a distortion of local tradition . Mortlach is nearby the site of the battle in which Máel Coluim mac Donnchada ( Malcolm III ) wrested power from Lulach . Máel Coluim 's first wife , Ingibiorg <unk> , was the niece of Harald III of Norway , and it has been argued by Alex Woolf that the tradition of a battle between the Scots and Norwegians is due to a Scandinavian involvement on the side of Máel Coluim . 
 It is thought that , as a native of the area in which the Battle of Barry is supposed to have occurred , Boece may have used local folklore as his source . Boece is no longer regarded as a credible historical source . 
 In some versions of the story , Camus and his army camped prior to the battle at a location previously known as ' Norway Dykes ' , near Kirkbuddo , to the north of Carnoustie , and the battle took place the day after the feast day of St Brigid . For example , Gordon quotes Robert Maule from his ' De Antiquitate Gentis Scotorum ' ( 1609 ) : 
 About eight miles from Brechin , at <unk> [ Kirkbuddo ] , a place belongs to the Earl of Crawford , are to be seen the vestiges of a Danish camp , fortified with a rampart and ditch , and vulgarly called Norway Dikes ; near which is the village of <unk> [ <unk> ] , where anciently was a church dedicated to St <unk> , because on that saint 's day which preceded the battle , Camus , general of the Danes , pitched his camp there . 
 This places the battle on 2 February , St Brigid 's day being 1 February . 
 = = = Archaeological evidence = = = 
 The story of the battle appears to have originated due to a romantic misinterpretation of the numerous tumuli that existed towards the eastern boundary of Barry Parish , near the Lochty burn before the town of Carnoustie was founded in the late 18th century . 
 Raphael Holinshed ( ca . 1580 ) claimed that the bodies found in the area were those of Danish soldiers , slain in the battle : 
 King <unk> after he <unk> this famous <unk> ( as before is said ) at Barre , he caused the <unk> of the field to be divided <unk> his <unk> , according to the laws of armes ; and then caused the dead bodies of the Danes to be buried in the place where the field had <unk> fought , and the bodies of the <unk> which were found dead were <unk> unto the places of christian <unk> , and there buried with <unk> obsequies in <unk> churches and churchyards . There are seene <unk> bones of the Danes in those places where they were buried , there <unk> bare above ground even unto this day , the sands ( as it often <unk> ) being <unk> from them . 
 Doubt was cast on this by Robert Dickson in 1878 , when he pointed out that , while relatively high @-@ status goods were found in some of the graves disinterred during early building work in Carnoustie , there was a lack of weapons . He also talked of the apparent presence of female skeletons . Subsequent finds pointed to the area being a domestic Pictish Long @-@ <unk> cemetery , including the remains of a female aged between 40 and 50 with osteoarthritis , who apparently died of tuberculosis . In contrast with Holinshed 's account , the burials there are Christian , found in a supine , east @-@ west orientation . 
 The Danish involvement in the ' battle ' centres entirely on an apparently common misinterpretation of Pictish archaeology . For example , Boece interprets the battle scene on the Kirkyard Stone at Aberlemno as being an account of another battle between the Scots and Danes , in the aftermath of the Battle of Barry : 
 Ane <unk> <unk> of Danis , <unk> in the <unk> maner , war slane at <unk> , not IV <unk> fra Brechin : <unk> ane <unk> stane is <unk> with crafty <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> done be our <unk> <unk> the Danis . 
 This view was the norm for some time after Boece and is reflected in the Statistical Accounts for Aberlemno . It took until the mid @-@ 19th century for it to be pointed out that not only was there no evidence that the stones were Scandinavian in origin , there was also ample evidence that the stones were Pictish / Scottish in origin . The <unk> stone predates the Battle of Barry by three centuries and the most widely accepted interpretation is that the stone commemorates the Pictish victory at the historical Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 AD . 
 The archaeological remains at Kirkbuddo , previously attributed to a Danish camp are now known to have been a temporary Roman marching camp . 
 = = = Camus = = = 
 No written evidence of Camus exists outside of the body of work which followed Boece . The story of Camus is likely to have been a misunderstanding of the name ' Camuston ' , or as it is in Boece 's account ( as translated by Bellenden ) , Camustane : 
 <unk> at last , the Danis war <unk> , and Camus <unk> to the <unk> . The Scottis <unk> on him with sic fury , that he was <unk> slane . In signe <unk> , the place , <unk> he was slane , is callit <unk> , Camustane . 
 Camuston no longer exists as a village , but for location see for example the 1794 map by Ainslie . The Camuston Cross , once thought to mark the place of Camus ' death , is now thought to be a late Pictish era monument , dating from the 10th Century . It should be noted that ' Camus ' is not recognisable as a Scandinavian name , and that there are earlier variants of the place name , e.g. ' <unk> ' as it is called in documents from 1425 – 6 , which has a Celtic etymology . 
 A burial disinterred near the Camuston cross was attributed by Maule as being the body of Camus : 
 Nine years after I wrote that treatise , a plough turning up the ground discovered a sepulchre , believed to be that of Camus , enclosed with four great stones . Here a huge skeleton was dug up , supposed to have been the body of Camus ; it appeared to have received its death by a wound on the back part of the head , seeing a considerable part of the skull was cut away , and probably by the stroke of a sword 
 Little information of the burial exists , but goods found in the cist were kept at Brechin Castle . These were sketched by <unk> and are typical of Bronze Age artefacts , found fairly commonly in the area . 
 = Amanita regalis = 
 Amanita regalis , commonly known as the royal fly agaric or the king of Sweden Amanita , is a species of fungus in the Amanitaceae family . Common in Scandinavian countries , it is also found in eastern and northern Europe . In North America , its distribution is restricted to Alaska . The fruit bodies of the fungus somewhat resemble the fly agaric ( Amanita muscaria ) , and it was formerly regarded as a variety of this species . A. regalis differs from it in being larger , with a liver @-@ brown cap bearing numerous scabs , and in having a stem which is yellow @-@ ochre at the base , with patches or rings of patches . Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains muscimol , the same psychoactive compound found in A. muscaria . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 Amanita regalis was first described as Agaricus <unk> β regalis by Elias Magnus Fries in his Systema Mycologicum , published in 1821 . In 1887 , Pier Andrea Saccardo treated it as a variety of Amanita muscaria . Edmund Michael , in 1903 , became the first to consider it a distinct species . In 1941 , Jean @-@ Edouard Gilbert suggested a complete reorganization of the genus Amanita in his world monograph of the genus , and moved it to <unk> as A. muscaria var. regalis . In his original ( 1949 ) version of Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy , Rolf Singer considered it a subspecies of A. muscaria , but noted that it may be regarded as a separate species ; in the fourth edition ( 1986 ) , he listed it as a distinct species . A. regalis is classified in a section of Amanita within the genus , a grouping of related Amanitas that have a ring on the stem ( or remnants thereof ) , and a bulb at the base of it . More recently , a Japanese group studied the biogeography of A. muscaria and related species , and , using molecular phylogenetic analysis , concluded that the taxon should be considered a grouping of A. muscaria , rather than a distinct species . However , as of 2012 , both Index Fungorum and MycoBank list the taxon as Amanita regalis . 
 The species has been called by several vernacular names , including the " Brown fly agaric " , the " king of Sweden Amanita " , or the king fly agaric . In France it is known as <unk> royale , while in Germany it is <unk> . The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word regalis , meaning " royal " . In 2000 , it was selected by the German Mycological Society as " Mushroom of the Year " . 
 = = Description = = 
 Like all Amanita species , the bulk of the organism lies beneath the ground as a symbiotic partner to certain species of trees . The fruit body of the fungus is a reproductive structure that appears when appropriate environmental conditions of moisture , temperature , and nutrient availability are met . The cap of A. regalis is 10 to 25 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 to 9 @.@ 8 in ) broad , and , depending on the stage of its development , can range in shape from spherical to convex to somewhat flattened . The color is yellowish brown , and it is densely covered with yellowish to light ochraceous scabby warts , which are arranged in almost regular concentric rings . The rings are a remnant of the volva left behind during expansion of the young fruit body . The cap is fleshy and when mature has grooves on the margin , which can extend 1 @.@ 5 to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 to 0 @.@ 8 in ) . The cap cuticle may be separated from the cap by peeling , to almost the center . 
 The gills are crowded close together , free from attachment to the stem , and white with a creamy yellow tinge . The edges of the gills are floccose , meaning they have tufts of soft wooly hairs — another volval remnant . The stem of a mature individual is typically between 10 and 20 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 and 7 @.@ 9 in ) long and 1 @.@ 5 to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 to 0 @.@ 8 in ) wide , and spreads at the base into a bulb ornamented with 2 – 4 rings of small squamulose , lemon or ochre @-@ yellow warts . The entire stem and ring are not pure white but have a faint yellowish tinge . The flesh is whitish , faintly yellowish in the stem , and golden yellow under the cuticle of the cap . It does not change color in air , and has an insignificant taste and smell . 
 = = = Microscopic features = = = 
 The spores are broadly ellipsoid to roughly spherical , hyaline ( translucent ) , smooth , and have dimensions of 9 – 12 by 7 – 8 µm . They are non @-@ amyloid , meaning that they do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer 's reagent . The spore @-@ producing cells , the basidia , are club @-@ shaped , measure 38 – 46 by 3 – 13 µm , and have clamps at their bases . 
 = = Similar species = = 
 Amanita regalis is easily distinguished from A. muscaria by the absence of any red color in the cap , and the yellow patches on the stem . If it is a form that has a pale @-@ colored , yellowish @-@ brown cap , Amanita regalis may be confused with the <unk> ( Amanita rubescens , edible ) . The latter species can be identified by the flesh @-@ colored tinge it stains when cut or bruised , and also by the color of the flesh underneath the cuticle : A. regalis is yellowish while A. rubescens is white . Amanita pantherina has a similar color , but has white flesh below the cap cuticle , and a cup @-@ shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Amanita regalis is a rare species typically found growing on the ground in mountainous forests , both deciduous and coniferous . It is a mycorrhizal fungus , and exists in a symbiotic relationship with certain tree species . The system of fine below @-@ ground threads , the mycelium , envelopes the roots of the trees and supplies them with needed minerals , trace elements and water from the soil , while the tree , in turn , supplies the fungus with food from its own supply , which it produces through photosynthesis . A. regalis has been shown experimentally to form mycorrhiza with birch , Scots pine , Mountain pine , and Norway spruce . Fruit bodies have been reported to grow in fairy rings . 
 In Europe it is more common in northern than south Europe , and it has not been reported from south and west Europe . In addition to being common in Scandinavian countries , it has been collected in Germany , Hungary , Latvia , Russia , Slovakia , and Korea . In North America , its distribution is restricted to Alaska , where it is usually found above the tree line . 
 = = Toxicity = = 
 Amanita regalis is poisonous . A case of poisoning was reported from Finland , where three individuals believed they had consumed the edible parasol mushroom Macrolepiota procera . The symptoms of poisoning , which began 1 – 2 hours after ingestion of the mushrooms , were gastrointestinal — nausea and heavy vomiting . Two had central nervous system manifestations and cholinergic symptoms , including hallucinations , confusion , or loss of consciousness as well as profuse salivation and sweating . All three individuals recovered within 4 – 24 hours without any damage to liver , kidneys or the central nervous system . As this incident demonstrates , cooking the mushrooms does not completely neutralize the toxic components of Amanita regalis . Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains ibotenic acid and muscimol , the same toxic constituents as Amanita muscaria . 
 Amanita regalis has the ability to bioaccumulate the heavy metal vanadium , a phenomenon first reported in Amanita muscaria in 1931 . A field study of Scandinavian specimens found vanadium contents ranging from 38 to 169 mg of vanadium per kg of dry mushroom ( average of 119 mg / kg ) . For comparison , the vanadium concentration in most other mushrooms is typically less than 2 mg / kg .

 Guitar Hero : Aerosmith is a music rhythm game developed by Neversoft , published by Activision and distributed by RedOctane . It was released on the PlayStation 3 , Wii and Xbox 360 consoles , with Budcat Creations solely developing the PlayStation 2 port , Vicarious Visions solely developing the Wii port , and Aspyr Media solely publishing the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X ports . The game was released on June 26 , 2008 in Europe , on June 29 , 2008 in North America , August 6 , 2008 in Australia and October 9 , 2008 in Japan . Guitar Hero : Aerosmith sold as both a bundle with a specially designed guitar controller as well as a game @-@ only package . 
 The game is considered an expansion in the Guitar Hero series , extending upon the general features of Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock . As with other games in the series , the player uses a guitar @-@ shaped controller to simulate the playing of rock music by playing in @-@ time to scrolling notes on @-@ screen . It is the first game in the series to primarily focus on the work of one rock band , with Aerosmith songs comprising approximately 70 % of the soundtrack , while the remaining songs are from bands that have been influenced by or opened for Aerosmith . The single player Career mode allows the player to follow the history of the band through several real @-@ world @-@ inspired venues , interspersed with interviews from the band members about their past . Aerosmith re @-@ recorded four songs for this game , and have participated in a motion capture session to create their in @-@ game appearances . Guitar Hero : Aerosmith is the final installment of the series to only feature guitar and bass as possible instrument choices . The next entry ( Guitar Hero World Tour ) would introduce other roles to create a full band experience . 
 While Guitar Hero : Aerosmith maintains the same gameplay as past Guitar Hero games , it has received criticism for being shorter and easier than the previous Guitar Hero titles and difficult to justify its price point ; furthermore , with the game 's strong focus on one band , reviewers felt that the game 's ultimate enjoyment rested on the player 's appreciation for the music of Aerosmith .

 A departure from other games in the franchise , Guitar Hero : Aerosmith follows the career of Aerosmith , by playing significant songs in their catalog in a ' rough chronological fashion ' . The gameplay follows the band through various periods in its history , spanning from its first show at Mendon Nipmuc Regional High School in 1970 to the 2001 Super Bowl XXXV halftime show , to their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 19 , 2001 . The player starts as Joe Perry , and will eventually be able to unlock Brad Whitford and Tom Hamilton . The game does not focus on the internal strife and stress within the band ; Guitarist Joe Perry stated that the game would focus on the positive aspects of Aerosmith 's history . Perry has stated that " Having a game built around Aerosmith has been a huge honor and really a great experience for us . We 've put a lot of ideas into the game so that fans can have fun interacting with our music , getting inside our body of work and learning about the band 's history . " 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The gameplay in Guitar Hero : Aerosmith is based on the same gameplay elements from Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock . Players use a guitar controller to hold down fret keys and strum on the strum bar in time with the note patterns as they scroll down the screen in order to complete a song . The player 's performance is tracked by a Rock Meter , and if it falls too low , the song ends prematurely . Star Power can be collected by completing marked note phrases correctly , and by using the whammy bar during sustained notes ; Star Power is released by lifting the guitar controller vertically or by pressing the Select button in order to double the scoring multiplier and dramatically affect the Rock Meter . The player is rated after successfully completing a song from 3 to 5 stars , and can examine statistics related to their performance , and in Career mode , awarded money to be used to unlock ten bonus songs in " The Vault " and additional guitars , outfits , and other videos about the band . Each song can be played at one of four difficulties : Easy , Medium , Hard , and Expert . 
 The game offers several gameplay modes . Career mode is broken into six tiers of five tracks , each based on a period in Aerosmith 's history . Furthermore , within each tier , there are two Opening Acts , featuring non @-@ Aerosmith songs , that must be completed before the Aerosmith songs can be played ; the final song in each tier is an encore once the other four songs are completed . As the player completes this mode , they will also be presented with video clips talking about the band and other trivia about the band . The Career mode features one Boss Battle ( against Joe Perry ) as introduced in Guitar Hero III . Any unlocked song can be played in Quick Play mode , Co @-@ operative mode , with one player on lead guitar and the other on bass , and Competitive mode , including the Battle modes . Unlike Guitar Hero III , there is no Co @-@ Operative Career mode . One significant upgrade from Guitar Hero III is the addition of score balancing in Pro Face Off multiplayer mode , which allows each player to choose their own difficulty while still allowing each side to play the full note chart , instead of switching back and forth within regular Face Off . 
 = = Development = = 
 Billboard announced that the band Aerosmith was " working closely with the makers of Guitar Hero World Tour , which will be dedicated to the group 's music . " Guitar Hero : World Tour was also confirmed as in development following the announcement of the merger between Activision and Vivendi Games in December 2007 . 
 On February 15 , 2008 , Activision announced that one of their two new Guitar Hero installments would be Guitar Hero : Aerosmith , and would be released in June 2008 . Guitar Hero : Aerosmith was developed by Neversoft for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions , the Wii version of the game was being developed by Vicarious Visions , and the PlayStation 2 version was developed by Budcat Creations . 
 The idea for Guitar Hero : Aerosmith came about during the development of Guitar Hero III . Originally , a cover version of " Same Old Song and Dance " was present in the game , but Neversoft president Joel Jewett noted that the quality of the recording was poor . After getting in contact with Joe Perry , Perry was able to provide the original masters for the song , and , according to Neversoft developer Alan Flores , " that sort of established the relationship . " This also came at a time where Activision was attempting to expand the Guitar Hero franchise , and fans expressed a strong interest in playing a game focused solely on Aerosmith 's works , according to RedOctane 's Dusty Welch . Another producer for the game , Aaron <unk> , stated that Aerosmith was one of the five " holy grail " musical groups as polled by Activision . Newsweek reported that Aerosmith 's license allows for exclusive use of their songs within the Guitar Hero series for a limited amount of time , preventing their use within other rhythm games such as Rock Band . This is not the first time Aerosmith has appeared in a video game . The band was previously featured in both Quest for Fame and Revolution X. 
 Similar to Slash , Tom Morello , and Bret Michaels in Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock , the entire Aerosmith band has participated in motion capture to accurately recreate their moves digitally for the game . Additional opening acts and special guest stars are also in the game including Run @-@ D.M.C. ( D.M.C. appears as a playable character ) , The Kinks , and Lenny Kravitz . 
 While Aerosmith was able to provide many of the original master recordings to the development team , the band re @-@ recorded the four songs chosen for the game from their first album : " Make It " , " Movin ' Out " , " Dream On " and " Mama Kin " . Joe Perry re @-@ mastered the lead guitar on many songs to interact with the gameplay better , while Steven Tyler re @-@ recorded some of the vocals . 
 The game itself is based much on Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock 's mechanics with some improvements ; notably , hammer @-@ ons and pull @-@ offs are " less mushy " , there are new venues for the game , and while all other gameplay modes from Guitar Hero III are present , there is no co @-@ op career mode . The game 's interfaces and menus were redesigned for the game . Additionally , the team re @-@ evaluated the difficulty of the game based on feedback from players of Guitar Hero III who felt that there were " too many brick walls for casual fans " . 
 The developers attempted to recreate as many of historical venues within the game . For example , to fulfill Joe Perry 's request that they recreate Max 's Kansas City in New York , the developers used old photographs and YouTube videos of the club during the 1970s , to a highly accurate degree , as claimed by those that had attended the club during that period . Within these venues , set decorations are inspired from Aerosmith album covers . Five that were confirmed are Pump , Toys in the Attic , Just Push Play , Get Your Wings , and Nine Lives . 
 During Activision 's press conference at the 2008 E3 convention , it was announced that a long @-@ standing dispute between Activision and Electronic Arts over the use of guitar controllers in their respective games had been resolved ; Guitar Hero : Aerosmith on the 360 was patched after released to allow the use of the Rock Band controller within the game , while all such instruments will be usable in Guitar Hero World Tour . Guitar Hero and Rock Band guitar controllers for both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are also compatible with the Playstation 2 version of Guitar Hero : Aerosmith . 
 = = = Promotion = = = 
 Activision released Aerosmith 's " Dream On " to the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store as a free Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock downloadable song . The free download was available from February 16 – 18 , 2008 , after which it was removed pending the release of the game . 
 The members of Aerosmith participated in a special sneak preview event at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City on June 27 , 2008 , allowing attendees to ask questions and try out the game . Target had Chip Ganassi 's # 40 car , driven by Dario Franchitti , painted to celebrate the release of Guitar Hero : Aerosmith for a NASCAR race on June 29 , 2008 . 
 As with some of the previous installments in the series , Guitar Hero : Aerosmith is available as both a standalone disc and as part of a bundle . This bundle includes the Gibson Les Paul controller and a special red faceplate with the Aerosmith logo in white . The bundle also includes a tour book for the game listing the songs featured in the game . The special Aerosmith bundle is available for the PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , and Wii versions . The Playstation 2 bundle includes the Kramer Wireless controller included with Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock . There is also a very limited edition bundle for the PlayStation 2 at Wal @-@ Mart . This bundle comes with the game and two wired Gibson SG guitar controllers as bundled with the original Guitar Hero and its sequel . 
 = = Soundtrack = = 
 Guitar Hero : Aerosmith 's soundtrack consists of 41 songs ; thirty are playable during Career mode and another 11 songs are unlockable in the vault . Twenty @-@ nine of the songs are from Aerosmith , while the other twelve songs are from bands that inspired or have played with Aerosmith in the past . Most of the songs are master recordings , including four Aerosmith songs that were re @-@ recorded for this game . Four songs are covers — two performed by <unk> Sound and two by Steve <unk> . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The game has received generally mixed reviews . Many reviews found the game avoided some of Aerosmith 's " more popular sugar @-@ coated hits ... like ' Amazing ' , ' Crazy ' , or ' I Don 't Wanna Miss a Thing ' [ sic ] " , but felt that other major Aerosmith songs could have also been included . Game Informer noted that " creating a band specific game was smart " , but that " very little has changed from the base game " . They also complimented the great job that Activision did with their motion captures of Aerosmith . The difficulty of the game was not to be found as hard as Guitar Hero III due to the " very riff @-@ friendly guitarist " Joe Perry ; while reviewers felt this was a good correction from the previous game , they also noted that the easiness of Guitar Hero : Aerosmith led to some bland tiers , repetitive musical sections , and lack of any significant difficulty curve . The length of the game was poorly received , with reviewers commenting that it is difficult to justify the title priced equivalently as other next @-@ generation console full games . Eurogamer commented that one 's appreciation for the game " lives or dies based on [ the player 's ] fondness for Aerosmith " , and that ultimately , with other available music games that offer additional downloadable songs , a game that focuses on a single band would need " to offer gameplay innovations , spectacular fan service , or a lot more material " than what Guitar Hero : Aerosmith provides . Reviews also noted the sparseness of downloadable content . 
 Guitar Hero : Aerosmith sold more than 567 @,@ 000 copies in its first week and grossed more than $ 25 million . The game has seen more than $ 50 million in sales in the first three months following its release , with over one million copies sold . The band itself saw a 40 % increase in their catalog sales in the weeks following the game 's release . According to Activision @-@ Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick , Guitar Hero : Aerosmith has made more money for the band than any sales of their previous albums . The game surged in sales in April 2009 , with 110 @,@ 000 copies for the Xbox 360 sold in North America , due to retails discounts on the title following the release of Guitar Hero : Metallica , and actually outsold the newer title . By April 2010 , the game has seen more than 3 @.@ 6 million units sold , 2 @.@ 7 in North America , and is considered the best selling band @-@ centric music game across both Guitar Hero and Rock Band series . 
 = University of Miami = 
 The University of Miami ( informally referred to as UM , U of M , or The U ) is a private , nonsectarian research university located in Coral Gables , Florida , United States . As of 2015 , the university enrolls 16 @,@ 848 students in 12 separate colleges / schools , including a medical school located in Miami 's Civic Center neighborhood , a law school on the main campus , and a school focused on the study of oceanography and atmospheric sciences on Virginia Key , with research facilities at the Richmond Facility in southern Miami @-@ Dade County . The university offers 116 undergraduate , 105 master 's , and 63 doctoral degree programs of which 59 are research / scholarship and four professional areas of study . Over the years , the university 's students have represented all 50 states and close to 150 foreign countries . With more than 14 @,@ 000 full and part @-@ time faculty and staff , UM is the sixth largest employer in Miami @-@ Dade County . 
 Research is a component of each academic division , with UM attracting $ 346 @.@ 6 million per year in sponsored research grants . UM offers a large library system with over 3 @.@ 1 million volumes and exceptional holdings in Cuban heritage and music . UM also offers a wide range of student activities , including fraternities and sororities , a student newspaper and radio station . UM 's intercollegiate athletic teams , collectively known as the Miami Hurricanes , compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association , and its football team has won five national championships since 1983 . 
 = = History = = 
 A group of citizens chartered the University of Miami ( UM ) in 1925 with the intent to offer " unique opportunities to develop inter @-@ American studies , to further creative work in the arts and letters , and to conduct teaching and research programs in tropical studies . " They believed that a local university would benefit their community . They were overly optimistic about future financial support for UM because the South Florida land boom was at its peak . During the Jim Crow era , there were three large state @-@ funded universities in Florida for white males , white females , and black <unk> ( UF , FSU , and FAMU , respectively ) ; in this accord , UM was founded as a white , coeducational institution . 
 The University began in earnest in 1925 when George E. Merrick , the founder of Coral Gables , gave 160 acres ( 0 @.@ 6 km2 ) and nearly $ 5 million , ( $ 67 @.@ 5 million , adjusted for current inflation ) to the effort . These contributions were land contracts and mortgages on real estate that had been sold in the city . The University was chartered on April 18 , 1925 by the Circuit Court for Dade County . By the fall of 1926 , when the first class of 372 students enrolled at UM , the land boom had collapsed , and hopes for a speedy recovery were dashed by a major hurricane . For the next 15 years the University barely remained solvent . The construction of the first building on campus , now known as the Merrick Building , was left half built for over two decades due to economic difficulties . In the meantime , classes were held at the nearby Anastasia Hotel , with partitions separating classrooms , giving the University the early nickname of " Cardboard College . " 
 In 1929 , Walsh and the other members of the Board of Regents resigned in the wake of the collapse of the Florida economy . UM 's plight was so severe that students went door to door in Coral Gables collecting funds to keep it open . A reconstituted ten @-@ member Board was chaired by UM 's first president Bowman Foster Ashe ( 1926 – 1952 ) . The new board included Merrick , Theodore Dickinson , E.B. Douglas , David Fairchild , James H. Gilman , Richardson Saunders , Frank B. <unk> , Joseph H. Adams , and J. C. Penney . In 1930 , several faculty members and more than 60 students came to UM when the University of Havana closed due to political unrest . UM filed for bankruptcy in 1932 . In July 1934 , the University of Miami was reincorporated and a Board of Trustees replaced the Board of Regents . By 1940 , community leaders were replacing faculty and administration as trustees . The University survived this early turmoil . During Ashe 's presidency , the University added the School of Law ( 1928 ) , the School of Business Administration ( 1929 ) , the School of Education ( 1929 ) , the Graduate School ( 1941 ) , the Marine Laboratory ( 1943 , renamed in 1969 as the Rosenstiel School ) , the School of Engineering ( 1947 ) , and the School of Medicine ( 1952 ) . 
 During World War II , UM was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V @-@ 12 Navy College Training Program , which offered students a path to a Navy commission . 
 One of Ashe 's longtime assistants , Jay F. W. Pearson , assumed the presidency in 1952 . A charter faculty member and a marine biologist by trade , Pearson retained the position until 1962 . During his presidency , UM awarded its first doctorate degrees and saw an increase in enrollment of more than 4 @,@ 000 . 
 The social changes of the 1960s and 1970s were reflected at UM . In 1961 , UM dropped its policy of racial segregation and began to admit black students . African Americans were also allowed full participation in student activities and sports teams . After President Stanford pressed for minority athletes , in December 1966 , UM signed Ray Bellamy , an African American football player . With Bellamy , UM became the first major college in the Deep South with a Black football player on scholarship . UM established an Office of Minority Affairs to promote diversity in both undergraduate and professional school admissions . With the start of the 1968 football season , President Henry Stanford barred the playing of " Dixie " by the university 's band . 
 Historically , UM regulated female student conduct more than men 's conduct with a staff under the Dean of Women watching over the women . UM combined the separate Dean of Men and Dean of Women positions in 1971 . In 1971 , UM formed a Women 's Commission which issued a 1974 report on the status of women on campus . The result was UM 's first female commencement speaker , day care , and a Women 's Study minor . Following the enactment of Title IX in 1972 , and decades of litigation , all organizations , including honorary societies were open to women . The Women 's Commission also sought more equitable funding for women 's sports . Terry Williams Munz became the first woman in America awarded an athletic scholarship when she accepted a golf scholarship from UM in 1973 . 
 From 1961 to 1968 , UM leased buildings on its South Campus to serve as the covert headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency 's JMWAVE operation against Fidel Castro 's government in Cuba . In 1968 , after Ramparts magazine exposed CIA operations on other campuses , JMWAVE was moved off the UM campus out of concern for embarrassing the university . 
 Henry King Stanford became UM 's third president in 1962 . The Stanford presidency saw increased emphasis on research , reorganization of administrative structure and construction of new facilities . Among the new research centers established were the Center for Advanced International Studies ( 1964 ) , the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Evolution ( 1964 ) , the Center for Theoretical Studies ( 1965 ) , and the Institute for the Study of Aging ( 1975 ) . Under Stanford , in 1965 , UM began to recruit international students . 
 In 1981 , Edward T. Foote II became the school 's fourth president . Under Foote 's leadership , on campus student housing was converted into a system of residential colleges . In addition , Foote initiated a five @-@ year $ 400 million fundraising campaign that began in 1984 and raised $ 517 @.@ 5 million . He saw the endowment expand from $ 47 @.@ 4 million in 1981 to $ 465 @.@ 2 million in 2000 . 
 Foote was succeeded by Donna Shalala , who assumed the UM presidency in 2001 . Under Shalala , Miami built new libraries , dormitories , symphony rehearsal halls , and classroom buildings . The university 's academic quality and student quality also have improved as a result . During Shalala 's leadership of the University of Miami , Miami hosted one of three nationally televised U.S. presidential debates of the 2004 U.S. Presidential election . 
 Starting in 2002 , UM conducted a fundraising campaign titled " Momentum : The Campaign for the University of Miami " that ultimately raised $ 1 @.@ 37 billion , the most money raised by any college in Florida as of February 8 , 2008 . Of that amount , $ 854 million went to the medical campus . On November 30 , 2007 , UM acquired the Cedars Medical Center and renamed it the " University of Miami Hospital " , giving the Miller School of Medicine an in @-@ house teaching hospital rather than being merely affiliated with area hospitals . 
 On February 28 , 2006 , custodial workers at the University of Miami , who are contracted to the university by a Boston , Massachusetts @-@ based company , <unk> , began a strike prompted by allegations of unfair labor practices , substandard pay , lack of health benefits , and workplace safety . After students began a hunger strike and on @-@ campus vigil , the strike was settled on May 1 , 2006 . The settlement resulted in a card count which led to the recognition of the first union @-@ represented bargaining unit at UM . UM raised wages from $ 6 @.@ 40 to $ 8 @.@ 35 per hour and provided health insurance . 
 In 2008 – 09 , UM responded to the economic slowdown by tightening expenditures . While its endowment lost over 26 @.@ 8 % of its value , impacting endowment income , the school receives more than 98 % of its operating budget from other sources . 
 In 2011 , UM was ranked the nation 's most fiscally @-@ responsible nonprofit organization by Worth magazine , in a report issued in collaboration with nonprofit watchdog Charity Navigator .

 = = = = Student housing = = = = 
 The Coral Gables campus houses 4 @,@ 500 enrolled students . This group is disproportionately freshmen ( 84 % of new freshmen live on campus compared with 43 % of all degree undergraduates ) . UM 's on campus housing consists of five residential colleges and one apartment @-@ style housing area available only to undergraduate degree seeking students . The residential colleges are divided into two dormitory @-@ style residence halls and three suite @-@ style residence halls . The McDonald and Pentland Towers of Hecht Residential College and the Walsh and <unk> Towers of Stanford Residential College are commonly referred to as the " Freshman Towers " , as the single @-@ sex by floor ( with shared bathroom facilities ) co @-@ ed dormitories generally house new students . Eaton Residential College , which originally housed only women , and the Mahoney / Pearson Residential Colleges have suite @-@ style housing with every two double @-@ occupancy rooms connected by a shared bathroom . 
 In addition to these five residential colleges , Miami also has an area called the University Village which consists of seven buildings with apartment @-@ style annual contract housing , fully furnished with kitchen facilities . The University Village is only open to juniors and seniors , but was previously open to graduate students and students of the School of Law up until July 31 , 2009 ; after this date , there has been no housing available for any graduate students on the Coral Gables campus . The University of Miami also has a series of fraternity houses , opposite the intramural fields on San Amaro Drive , dubbed " Fraternity Row " ; the sororities do not possess any such facilities . 
 Miami previously had a series of seven buildings set aside for student residences called the Apartment Area , consisting of the oldest dormitories on campus which were originally built to house married veterans and their families . These buildings also featured fully furnished apartments with kitchen facilities , but were not leased to students as in the University Village . These residences were closed at the end of the Spring 2010 semester , although several others of these original dormitories continue to be used as office space for departments such as the Office of Student Employment , the Air Force ROTC Detachment 155 , and the Center for Alcohol and Other Drug Education <unk> 21 . 
 The University of Miami does not offer housing for students with children or for married students . UM abolished its separate dorms for athletes in 1990 .

These additional Gold LEED certified buildings are being built by Wexford Science & Technology , a private developer , on land leased from UM . The Medical campus is connected to UM 's main campus by the Miami Metrorail with direct stations at University Station for the main campus , and Civic Center Station for the medical campus . 
 On December 1 , 2007 , the University purchased the Cedars Medical Center , renaming it as the University of Miami Hospital . Situated in the Miami Health District , the hospital is close to the Jackson Memorial Hospital , which has been used by the UM students and faculty to provide patient care for many years . 
 Starting in 2004 , the Miller School began offering instruction on the campus of Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton , Florida . MD candidates were admitted to either the Miami or Boca Raton programs and spent the first two years studying on the selected campus and the last two on the main campus in Miami . In April 2005 , the Boca Raton program was expanded to include a third clinical year in Palm Beach County . In 2010 , when Florida Atlantic University made plans to establish their own medical school , no future classes of the regional campus were accepted . The last class to complete the first three years of training in Boca Raton is the Class of 2013 . 
 There is no on campus housing for students of the Miller School of Medicine in Miami or Boca Raton . The Miami and Boca Raton campuses charge identical tuition , with a lower tuition for in @-@ state students .

 In 1945 , construction began on the Rickenbacker Causeway to make Virginia Key accessible by car . The county offered to give UM a part of the island adjacent to the Miami Seaquarium in exchange for UM operating the aquarium . However , the aquarium construction was delayed when a bond referendum failed , so UM leased the land in 1951 . In 1953 , UM built classroom and lab buildings on a 16 acre ( 65 @,@ 000 m ² ) campus to house what would become the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science . Additional buildings were added in 1957 , 1959 and 1965 . The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory is located across the Rickenbacker Causeway from the campus . From 1947 to 1959 , the State of Florida funded the UM Marine Lab on Virginia Key until the State built a separate marine lab in St. Petersburg . In 2009 , UM received a $ 15 million federal grant to help construct a new $ 43 @.@ 8 million , 56 @,@ 500 square feet ( 5 @,@ 250 m2 ) Marine Technology and Life Sciences Seawater Research Building .

 A former philosophy graduate student at the university , Monica Morrison , complained in 2014 to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that the university had mishandled a sexual @-@ harassment complaint she made , in September 2012 , against the philosopher Colin McGinn .

The student said that there had been no consensual relationship . 
 When McGinn began blogging about the situation , 93 philosophy academics , including Elizabeth S.

 Represented by Ann <unk> , the student filed a lawsuit in October 2015 alleging that the university had violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 by failing to investigate her complaint adequately . The lawsuit alleges that the university prioritized its reputation over the student 's welfare ; did not inform her of her right to make a formal Title IX complaint ; allocated the complaint to the informal track without her consent ; did not allow her to present witnesses ; misleadingly presented the situation as a consensual relationship ; allowed McGinn to remain on campus and supervise female students ; and did not require him to sign a non @-@ disclosure or non @-@ disparagement clause . The lawsuit also accuses McGinn of sexual harassment , civil assault and defamation , and another faculty member , Edward Erwin , of defamation .

 = Final Fantasy VI = 
 Final Fantasy VI ( <unk> , Fainaru Fantajī Shikkusu , also known as Final Fantasy III for its initial North American release ) is a role @-@ playing video game developed and published by Square for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . Released in 1994 , it is the sixth title in the mainline Final Fantasy series . Set in a fantasy world with a technology level equivalent to that of the Second Industrial Revolution , the game 's story focuses on a group of rebels as they seek to overthrow an imperial dictatorship . The game features fourteen permanent playable characters , the most of any game in the main series . 
 It was ported by Tose with minor differences to Sony 's PlayStation in 1999 and Nintendo 's Game Boy Advance in 2006 , and it was released for the Wii 's Virtual Console in 2011 . The game was known as Final Fantasy III when it was first released in North America , as the original Final Fantasy II , Final Fantasy III , and Final Fantasy V had not been released outside Japan at the time ( leaving IV as the second title released outside Japan and VI as the third ) . However , most later localizations used the original title . Final Fantasy VI was the first game in the series to be directed by someone other than producer and series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi ; the role was filled instead by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito . Yoshitaka Amano , a long @-@ time contributor to the Final Fantasy series , returned as the image and character designer , while regular composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote the game 's score , which has been released on several soundtrack albums . 
 Final Fantasy VI was released to critical acclaim and is seen as a landmark title for the role @-@ playing genre ; for instance , it was ranked as the number one RPG of all time by IGN . Its Super NES and PlayStation versions have sold over 3 @.@ 48 million copies worldwide to date as a stand @-@ alone game , as well as over 750 @,@ 000 copies as part of the Japanese Final Fantasy Collection and the North American Final Fantasy Anthology . Final Fantasy VI has won numerous awards . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Like previous Final Fantasy installments , Final Fantasy VI consists of four basic modes of gameplay : an overworld map , town and dungeon field maps , a battle screen , and a menu screen . The overworld map is a scaled @-@ down version of the game 's fictional world , which the player uses to direct characters to various locations . As with most games in the series , the three primary means of travel across the overworld are by foot , chocobo , and airship . With a few plot @-@ driven exceptions , enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld when traveling by foot . The menu screen is where the player makes such decisions as which characters will be in the traveling party , which equipment they wield , the magic they learn , and the configuration of the gameplay . It is also used to track experience points and levels . 
 The game 's plot develops as the player progresses through towns and dungeons . Town citizens will offer helpful information and some residents own item or equipment shops . Later in the game , visiting certain towns will activate side @-@ quests . Dungeons appear as a variety of areas , including caves , sewers , forests , and buildings . These dungeons often have treasure chests containing rare items that are not available in most stores . Some dungeons feature puzzles and mazes , which require the player to divide the characters into multiple parties . 
 = = = Combat = = = 
 Combat in Final Fantasy VI is menu @-@ based , in which the player selects an action from a list of such options as Fight , Magic , and Item . A maximum of four characters may be used in battles , which are based on the series ' traditional Active Time Battle ( ATB ) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV . Under this system , each character has an action bar that replenishes itself at a rate dependent on their speed statistic . When a character 's action bar is filled , the player may assign an action . In addition to standard battle techniques , each character possesses a unique special ability . For example , Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies , while Celes ' Runic ability allows her to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn . 
 Another element is a powerful attack substitution that occasionally appears when a character 's health is low . Similar features appear in later Final Fantasy titles under a variety of different names , including Limit Breaks , Desperation Moves , <unk> , and Overdrives . Characters are rewarded for victorious battles with experience points and money , called gil ( Gold Piece ( GP ) in the original North American localization ) . When characters attain a certain amount of experience points , they gain a level , which increases their statistics . An additional player may play during battle scenarios , with control of individual characters assigned from the configuration menu . 
 = = = Customization = = = 
 Characters in Final Fantasy VI can be equipped with a wide variety of weapons , armor and accessories ( known as " Relics " ) to increase their statistics and obtain special abilities . Most of this equipment can be used by several different characters , and each character may equip up to two Relics . Relics have a variety of uses and effects , some of which alter basic battle commands , allow characters to use multiple weapons , provide permanent status changes during battle or use protective magical spells in response to being near death . 
 Although only two characters start the game with the ability to use magic , almost every character can learn to do so . Characters may equip magicite , which enables the summoning of espers , this game 's incarnation of summoned monsters ( including several recurring summons such as Ifrit , Shiva , Bahamut and Odin , along with many new summons exclusive to Final Fantasy VI ) , as well as that of specific magic spells . If a character has a piece of magicite equipped , he or she will gain " Magic Acquisition Points " after most battles . As a character gains magic AP , he or she gradually learns spells from the magicite equipped and will gain additional statistic bonuses when leveling up , depending on the magicite . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 Final Fantasy VI takes place on a large , unnamed world . During the course of the game , its geography and landscape change due to various developments in the game 's plot . During the first half of the game , the world is divided into three major continents and referred to as the World of Balance . The northern continent is punctuated by a series of mountain ranges and contains many of the locations accessible to the player . Most of the southern continent has been taken over by the Empire , while the eastern continent is home to a large patch of land called the Veldt where monsters from all over the world can be found . Halfway through the game , the world 's geographical layout is altered , resulting in its three large continents splitting into several islands of various size situated around a larger continent at their center . This altered layout of the game 's locations is referred to as the World of Ruin . 
 In contrast to the medieval settings featured in previous Final Fantasy titles , Final Fantasy VI is set in a steampunk environment . The structure of society parallels that of the latter half of the 19th century , with opera and the fine arts serving as recurring motifs throughout the game , and a level of technology comparable to that of the Second Industrial Revolution . Railroads and steamships are in use , and a coal mining operation is run in the northern town of Narshe . Additionally , several examples of modern engineering and weaponry ( such as a chainsaw and drill ) have been developed in the Kingdom of Figaro . However , communication systems have not reached significant levels of development , with letters sent by way of carrier pigeon serving as the most common means of long @-@ distance communication . 
 A thousand years before the events of the game , three entities known as the Warring Triad initiated a conflict that would come to be called the War of the Magi . This quarrel grew to catastrophic proportions , unleashing magical energy into the world which transformed afflicted humans into espers — magical beings who themselves were used as soldiers in the war . Eventually realizing the horrific calamity wrought by their hands , the Triad returned free will to the espers and sealed their own powers , becoming stone statues . Their only request was that the espers ensure their power remain locked away so it might never be used again . The espers carried their stone gods to a hidden land , sealing both the statues and themselves off from the realm of humans . The concept of magic gradually faded to legend and myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology . At the game 's opening , the most advanced nation is the Empire , a cruel and expanding dictatorship led by Emperor Gestahl and his clownish general Kefka Palazzo . Approximately eighteen years before the events of the game begin , the barrier between the espers ' land and the rest of the world weakened . Soon after , Gestahl takes advantage of this and attacks the espers ' land , capturing several of them . 
 Using the espers as a power source , Gestahl initiated a research program to combine magic with machinery and infuse humans with magical powers , the result being a craft known as " Magitek " . Kefka became the first experimental prototype of a line of magically empowered soldiers called Magitek Knights , drastically impairing his sanity . Magitek innovations have allowed the Empire to supplement its forces with mechanical infantry , armed with Magitek @-@ powered weaponry . At the opening of the game , the Empire is on the verge of rediscovering the full potential of magic by reopening the gateway to the world of the espers . However , Gestahl 's military dominion is opposed by the Returners , a rebel organization seeking to overthrow the Empire and free its territories . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 Final Fantasy VI features fourteen permanent playable characters , the most of any game in the main series , as well as several secondary characters who are only briefly controlled by the player . The starting character , Terra Branford , is a reserved half @-@ human , half @-@ esper girl who spent most of her life as a slave to the Empire , thanks to a mind @-@ controlling device , and is unfamiliar with love . Other primary characters include Locke Cole , a treasure hunter and rebel sympathizer with a powerful impulse to protect women ; Celes <unk> , a former general of the Empire , who joined the Returners after being jailed for questioning imperial practices ; Edgar Figaro , a consummate womanizer and the king of Figaro , who claims allegiance to the Empire while secretly supplying aid to the Returners ; Sabin Rene Figaro , Edgar 's brother , who fled the royal court in order to pursue his own path and hone his martial arts skills ; Cyan <unk> , a loyal knight to the kingdom of Doma who lost his family and friends as a result of Kefka poisoning the kingdom 's water supply ; Setzer Gabbiani , a habitual gambler and thrill seeker and owner of the world 's only airship ; Shadow , a ninja mercenary , who offers his services to both the Empire and the Returners at various stages throughout the game ; Relm <unk> , a young but tough artistic girl with magical powers ; Strago Magus , Relm 's elderly grandfather and a Blue Mage ; Gau , a feral child surviving since infancy in the harsh wilderness known as the Veldt ; Mog , a Moogle from the mines of Narshe ; <unk> , a savage but loyal <unk> also from Narshe , talked into joining the Returners through Mog 's persuasion ; and Gogo , a mysterious , fully shrouded master of the art of mimicry . 
 Most of the main characters in the game hold a significant grudge against the Empire and , in particular , Kefka Palazzo , who serves as one of the game 's main antagonists along with Emperor Gestahl . The supporting character Ultros serves as a recurring villain and comic relief throughout the game . A handful of Final Fantasy VI characters have reappeared in later games , such as Secret of Evermore . Additionally , Final Fantasy SGI , a short tech demo produced for the Silicon Graphics Onyx workstation , featured polygon @-@ based 3D renderings of Locke , Terra , and Shadow . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 Final Fantasy VI begins with a mind @-@ controlled Terra Branford participating in an Imperial raid on Narshe in search of a recently unearthed frozen esper ( later identified as <unk> ; <unk> in the GBA retranslation ) found in the city 's mines . The esper then kills Terra 's controllers and breaks the Imperial control over her , but she is unable to remember anything about her past . Locke Cole , a treasure hunter , promises to protect her until she can regain her memories and helps her escape to the hideout of the Returners , a group of militants opposing the Empire . Along the way , they pass through the Kingdom of Figaro and meet Edgar Roni Figaro , the king , and his estranged brother , Sabin Rene Figaro , who join them . Banon , the leader of the Returners , asks for Terra 's help in their struggle against the Empire , and she agrees . Just as the resistance is preparing to return to Narshe to investigate the frozen esper , the Empire attacks South Figaro . Locke heads to the besieged town to slow the Empire 's advance , while the rest of the group makes their way via rafting down the nearby Lethe River . However , Sabin is separated from the group after a battle with Ultros , self @-@ proclaimed " octopus royalty " and a recurring antagonist , forcing the various members of the Returners to find their own ways to Narshe in three different scenarios controlled by the player . In Locke 's scenario , he must escape the imperial occupied town of South Figaro without detection . Sabin has been swept to a distant continent and must find a way back while Terra , Edgar , and Banon will continue to float down the Lethe River back to Narshe . 
 Eventually , the original party reunites in Narshe . Locke brings with him Celes <unk> , one of the Empire 's own generals , whom he saved from execution for defying the Empire 's ruthless practices . Sabin brings with him Cyan <unk> , whose family was killed during the Empire 's siege of Doma Castle when Kefka Palazzo ordered the water supply poisoned , and Gau , a feral child he befriended on the Veldt . In Narshe , the Returners prepare to defend the frozen esper from the Empire . After the player successfully thwarts the Imperial invasion , Terra approaches the frozen esper , prompting her to transform into an esper @-@ like form herself . She flies away , confused and horrified by her own transformation . 
 The Returners set out to search for Terra and eventually trace her to the city of Zozo , though they are still shocked by her apparent existence as an esper . There , they also meet the esper <unk> , who tells them that if they free various other espers from the Magitek Research Facility in the Empire 's capital , Vector , they may find one who can help Terra . Vector is on the southern continent , to which the Empire does not allow maritime access , so the Returners go to the Opera House and recruit Setzer Gabbiani , who is believed to be the owner of the Blackjack , the only airship in the world . They then travel to Vector and attempt to rescue several espers , including <unk> , who is revealed to be Terra 's father . However , the espers are already dying from the experiments at Vector , and choose instead to give their lives to transform into magicite — the crystallized remains of the espers ' essences that form when they die and allow others to use their powers . The dying espers bestow their magicite upon the Returners . Before the group can then escape , Kefka arrives and causes the Returners , including Locke , to momentarily doubt Celes ' loyalty , much to her anguish . However , she provides proof to them of her support by covering for the group while the rest escape . The rest of the group then returns to Zozo , where Terra reacts to the magicite of her father , prompting her to gain knowledge of her past and accept herself as the half @-@ human , half @-@ esper child of <unk> and a human woman . 
 After reuniting with Terra , the Returners decide that it is time to launch an all @-@ out attack on the Empire , and Banon asks Terra to attempt contacting the espers ' land in order to gain their support . Terra succeeds in making contact , and when the espers learn that the others captured by the Empire previously have now perished , they become infuriated and enter the human world , where they destroy much of Vector . When the Returners arrive in the capital , they find Emperor Gestahl claiming to no longer have the will to fight , inviting the Returners to a banquet to negotiate peace . Gestahl asks Terra to deliver a truce to the espers on his behalf , to which she agrees . Accompanied by Locke , Shadow ( a ninja mercenary hired by the Empire for the mission ) , Generals Celes and Leo , the player must then guide Terra to the remote village <unk> in search of the espers , where they meet Strago Magus and his granddaughter , Relm <unk> , who also accompany them . 
 Soon , they find the espers and Terra convinces them to accept a truce with Gestahl . However , during the negotiations , Kefka attacks the espers , killing each of those still alive and capturing the magicite that remains from their essence . Additionally , he kills General Leo , who is appalled by Kefka 's dishonorable tactics and attempts to defend the espers . The Returners reunite , now aware that the peace was a ploy for Gestahl to obtain magicite and the stone statue remains of the Warring Triad within the espers ' now @-@ unsealed land . Kefka and Gestahl travel through the open gate to the esper world , find the Warring Triad , and prompt the island on which the esper world is located to detach and fly in the sky as an ominous Floating Continent . The Returners attempt to stop them from causing further damage , but despite their efforts , they are unable to prevent Kefka and Gestahl from gaining the power of the statues . Now empowered , Kefka promptly kills Gestahl and moves the statues out of their proper alignment , upsetting the balance of magical power and causing the destruction of most of the surface world . In the disaster , the Returners are separated from one another as Setzer 's airship is torn apart . 
 One year later , Celes awakens from a coma on a deserted island and learns that the world has been devastated by Kefka , who now dominates it as a god @-@ like ruler . Much of the human population has died and plant and animal life are slowly being killed by sickness , punctuating humanity 's despair . Celes sets out from the Solitary Island to try to reunite with as many of her friends as she can find . One by one , in a series of mostly optional side @-@ quests , the player has the opportunity to reunite the group , all still alive , as well as new allies <unk> and Gogo . Together , the reunited Returners launch a new offensive against Kefka , using the Falcon — an airship that belonged to a deceased friend of Setzer 's — to reach Kefka 's Tower and infiltrate it . Inside , the Returners battle their way through Kefka 's defenses and destroy the three statues , the source of Kefka 's newfound power . When destroying the statues , once the source of all magic , does not cause any noticeable reaction , the party realizes that Kefka has successfully drained the Warring Triad of power and has become the source of all magical power . 
 Making a final stand against Kefka , the characters destroy him , but since the gods ' power had come to reside in him all magicite begins to shatter and Kefka 's magically @-@ maintained tower begins to crumble . Terra leads the characters out as she begins to weaken due to her half @-@ esper heritage . However , before her father 's magicite shatters , his spirit informs her that by holding to the human side of herself , she may survive the passing of magic . In the end , the party escapes Kefka 's Tower aboard the Falcon . Terra survives , and the group observes the world 's communities rejuvenating themselves . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Creation = = = 
 Final Fantasy VI entered development after the release of its predecessor Final Fantasy V in December 1992 . The development of the game took just one year to be completed . Series creator and director Hironobu Sakaguchi could not be as intimately involved as in previous installments due to his other projects and his promotion to Executive Vice President of the company in 1991 . For that reason , he became the producer and split director responsibilities for Final Fantasy VI up between Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito : Kitase was in charge of event production and the scenario , while Ito handled all battle aspects . Sakaguchi supervised Kitase 's cutscene direction and ensured that the project would coalesce as a whole . The idea behind the story of Final Fantasy VI was that every character is the protagonist . All members of the development team contributed ideas for characters and their " episodes " for the overall plot in what Kitase described as a " hybrid process " . Consequently , Terra and Locke were conceived by Sakaguchi ; Celes and Gau by Kitase ; Shadow and Setzer by graphic director Tetsuya Nomura ; and Edgar and Sabin by field graphic designer Kaori Tanaka . Then it was Kitase 's task to unite the story premise provided by Sakaguchi with all the individual ideas for character episodes to create a cohesive narrative . The scenario of Final Fantasy VI was written by a group of four or five people , among them Kitase who provided key elements of the story , such as the opera scene and Celes ' suicide attempt , as well as all of Kefka 's appearances . 
 Regular series character designer Yoshitaka Amano 's concept art became the basis for the models in the full motion videos produced for the game 's PlayStation re @-@ release . Tetsuya Takahashi , one of the graphic directors , drew the imperial Magitek Armors seen in the opening scene . By doing so , he disregarded Sakaguchi 's intention to reuse the regular designs from elsewhere in the game . The sprite art for the characters ' in @-@ game appearance was drawn by Kazuko Shibuya . While in the earlier installments , the sprites were less detailed on the map than in battle , Final Fantasy VI 's had an equally high resolution regardless of the screen . This enabled the use of animations depicting a variety of movements and facial expressions . Though it was not the first game to utilize the Super NES ' Mode 7 graphics , Final Fantasy VI made more extensive use of them than its predecessors . For instance , unlike both Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V , the world map is rendered in Mode 7 , which lends a somewhat three @-@ dimensional perspective to an otherwise two @-@ dimensional game . 
 = = = Localization = = = 
 The original North American localization and release of Final Fantasy VI by Square for the Super NES featured several changes from the original Japanese version . The most obvious of these is the change of the game 's title from Final Fantasy VI to Final Fantasy III ; because only two games of the series had been localized in North America at the time , Final Fantasy VI was distributed as Final Fantasy III to maintain naming continuity . Unlike Final Fantasy IV ( which was first released in North America as Final Fantasy II ) , there are no major changes to gameplay , though several changes of contents and editorial adjustments exist in the English script . In a January 1995 interview with Super Play magazine , translator Ted Woolsey explained that " there 's a certain level of playfulness and ... sexuality in Japanese games that just doesn 't exist here [ in the USA ] , basically because of Nintendo of America 's rules and guidelines " . Consequently , objectionable graphics ( e.g. nudity ) were censored and building signs in towns were changed ( such as Bar being changed to Café ) , as well as religious allusions ( e.g. the spell Holy was renamed Pearl ) . 
 Also , some direct allusions to death , killing actions , and violent expressions , as well as offensive words have been replaced by softer expressions . For example , after Edgar , Locke and Terra flee on chocobos from Figaro Castle , Kefka orders two Magitek Armored soldiers to chase them by shouting " Go ! KILL THEM ! " , in the Japanese version . It was translated as " Go ! Get them ! " Also , when Imperial Troopers burn Figaro Castle , and Edgar claims Terra is not hidden inside the castle , Kefka replies " then you can burn to death " in the Japanese version , which was replaced in the English version by " Then welcome to my barbecue ! " . Similarly , as Magitek soldiers watch Edgar and his guests escape on Chocobos , one swears in Japanese , " Son of a bitch ! " , which was translated by Ted Woolsey as " Son of a submariner ! " . The localization also featured changes to several names , such as " Tina " being changed to " Terra " . Finally , dialogue text files had to be shortened due to the limited data storage space available on the game cartridge 's read @-@ only memory . As a result , additional changes were rendered to dialogue in order to compress it into the available space . 
 The PlayStation re @-@ release featured only minor changes to the English localization . The title of the game was reverted to Final Fantasy VI from Final Fantasy III , to unify the numbering scheme of the series in North America and Japan with the earlier release of Final Fantasy VII . A few item and character names were adjusted , as in the expansion of " Fenix Down " to " Phoenix Down " . Unlike the PlayStation re @-@ release of Final Fantasy IV included in the later Final Fantasy Chronicles compilation , the script was left essentially unchanged . The Game Boy Advance re @-@ release featured a new translation by a different translator , Tom Slattery . This translation preserved most of the character names , location names , and terminology from the Woolsey translation , but changed item and spell names to match the conventions used in more recent titles in the series . The revised script preserved certain quirky lines from the original while changing or editing others , and it cleared up certain points of confusion in the original translation . The Wii Virtual Console release used the Final Fantasy III name of the SNES game . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The soundtrack for Final Fantasy VI was composed by long @-@ time series contributor Nobuo Uematsu . The score consists of themes for each major character and location , as well as music for standard battles , fights with boss enemies and for special cutscenes . The extensive use of leitmotif is one of the defining points of the audio tracks . The " Aria di Mezzo Carattere " is one of the latter tracks , played during a cutscene involving an opera performance . This track features an unintelligible synthesized " voice " that harmonizes with the melody , as technical limitations for the SPC700 sound format chip prevented the use of an actual vocal track ( although some developers eventually figured out how to overcome the limitation a few years later ) . The orchestral album Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale features an arranged version of the aria , using Italian lyrics performed by <unk> <unk> with an orchestral accompaniment . This version is also found in the ending full motion video of the game 's Sony PlayStation re @-@ release , with the same lyrics but a different musical arrangement . In addition , the album Orchestral Game Concert 4 includes an extended version of the opera arranged and conducted by Kōsuke <unk> and performed by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra , featuring Wakako <unk> , Tetsuya <unk> , and Hiroshi Kuroda on vocals . It was also performed at the " More Friends " concert at the Gibson Amphitheatre in 2005 using a new English translation of the lyrics , an album of which is now available . " Dancing Mad " , accompanying the game 's final battle with Kefka , is 17 minutes long and contains an organ cadenza , with variations on Kefka 's theme . The " Ending Theme " combines every playable character theme into one composition lasting over 21 minutes . 
 The original score was released on three Compact Discs in Japan as Final Fantasy VI : Original Sound Version . A version of this album was later released in North America as Final Fantasy III : Kefka 's Domain , this version of the album is the same as its Japanese counterpart , except for different packaging and small differences in the translation of some track names between the album and newer releases . Additionally , Final Fantasy VI : Grand Finale features eleven tracks from the game , arranged by Shirō Sagisu and Tsuneyoshi Saito and performed by the Ensemble Archi Della Scala and Orchestra <unk> di Milano ( Milan Symphony Orchestra ) . Piano Collections : Final Fantasy VI , a second arranged album , features thirteen tracks from the game , performed for piano by Reiko Nomura . More recently , " Dancing Mad " , the final boss theme from Final Fantasy VI , has been performed at Play ! A Video Game Symphony in Stockholm , Sweden on June 2 , 2007 , by the group <unk> Supremacy . 
 Nobuo Uematsu 's former rock band , The Black Mages , released a progressive metal version of Dancing Mad on their eponymous first album in 2003 . Their third album , subtitled Darkness and Starlight , is so named after its premiere track : a rock opera version of the entire opera from FFVI , including the Aria di Mezzo Carattere performed by Etsuyo Ota . 
 In 2012 , a Kickstarter campaign for OverClocked ReMix was funded at $ 153 @,@ 633 for the creation of a multiple CD album of remixes of the music from FFVI . Andrew Aversa directed the creation of the album which contains 74 tracks from 74 artists , each with its own unique style . The album is free and available at the OverClocked ReMix website .

 Final Fantasy VI received critical acclaim and was commercially successful in Japan upon release — it is now considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time , and on many major gaming sites such as IGN , the best in the Final Fantasy series . In mid @-@ 1994 Square 's publicity department reported that the game had sold 2 @.@ 55 million copies in Japan . In the United States , where it went on sale in the last quarter of 1994 , it became the year 's eighth best @-@ selling SNES cartridge ; despite this , it was not a commercial success in that region , according to Sakaguchi . As of March 31 , 2003 , the game had shipped 3 @.@ 48 million copies worldwide , with 2 @.@ 62 million of those copies being shipped in Japan and 860 @,@ 000 abroad . Final Fantasy Collection sold over 400 @,@ 000 copies in 1999 , making it the 31st @-@ best @-@ selling release of that year in Japan . Final Fantasy Anthology has sold approximately 364 @,@ 000 copies in North America . Final Fantasy VI Advance sold over 223 @,@ 000 copies in Japan by the end of 2006 , one month after release . 
 The game garnered rave reviews upon its original release . GamePro rated it 5 out of 5 , stating that " characters , plotlines , and multiple @-@ choice scenarios all combine to form one fantastic game ! " The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly granted it a unanimous score of 9 out of 10 and their " Game of the Month " award , commenting that it had set the new standard for excellence in RPGs . They particularly praised the graphics , music , and the strong emotional involvement of the story . It won several awards from Electronic Gaming Monthly in their 1994 video game awards , including Best Role @-@ Playing Game , Best Japanese Role @-@ Playing Game , and Best Music for a Cartridge @-@ Based Game . Additionally , they later ranked the game ninth in their 1997 list of the 100 greatest console games of all time . Famitsu scored it 37 out of 40 , making it one of their two highest @-@ rated games of 1994 ( along with Ridge Racer ) . For their part , Nintendo Power declared the game " the RPG hit of the decade " , noting its improved sound and graphics over its predecessors , and the game 's broadened thematic scope . Moreover , they suggested that " with so much story and variation of play ... fans may become lost in the world for months at a time " . Nintendo Power also opined that the game plot was " not particularly inventive " and the " story is often sappy – not written for an American audience " . 
 In 1997 , they ranked it as the eighth greatest Nintendo game , saying it " had everything you could want — heroes , world @-@ shattering events , magic , mindless evil — plus Interceptor the wonder dog ! " In 2010 , Nintendo Power listed the ending to Final Fantasy VI as one of the best finales , citing the great character moments that cement them as some of the most memorable Final Fantasy protagonists ever ; they also listed the opera scene as being a demonstration of how touching and emotional role @-@ playing games can be . 
 The game was still earning rave reviews after the release of its PlayStation version , with GamePro and Electronic Gaming Monthly rating it 4 out of 5 and 9 @.@ 5 out of 10 , respectively . Final Fantasy Collection received 54 out of 60 points from Weekly Famitsu , scored by a panel of six reviewers . In 1999 , IGN described the graphics of the PlayStation re @-@ release as " beautiful and stunning " , reflecting that , at the time of its release , " Final Fantasy III ... represented everything an RPG should be " , inspiring statistic growth systems that would later influence titles like Wild Arms and Suikoden . Moreover , they praised its gameplay and storyline , claiming that these aspects took " all ... preceding RPG concepts and either came up with something completely new or refined them enough to make them its own " , creating an atmosphere in which " [ players ] won 't find it difficult to get past the simplistic graphics or seemingly out @-@ dated gameplay conventions and become involved " . RPGamer gave a perfect rating to both the original game and its PlayStation re @-@ release , citing its gameplay as " self @-@ explanatory enough that most any player could pick up the game and customize their characters ' equipment " , while praising its music as " a 16 @-@ bit masterpiece " . Alternatively , they describe the game 's sound effects as limited and the game itself as lacking in replay value due to having " one ending , one [ fundamental ] path through the plot , and ... [ mandatory ] sidequests " . Additionally , they regarded the game 's English translation as " unremarkable " , being " better than some but worse than others " , and offered similar comments for its gameplay difficulty . However , they referred to the game 's storyline as its " most unique aspect " , citing its large cast of characters , " nearly all of whom receive a great deal of development " , and the " surprisingly large number of real world issues , the vast majority of which have not been addressed by any RPG before or since , ranging from teen pregnancy to suicide " . Overall , RPGamer regarded the game as an " epic masterpiece " and " truly one of the greatest games ever created " . 
 The game 's release for the Game Boy Advance also garnered praise . In 2007 , the Game Boy Advance re @-@ release was named eighth best Game Boy Advance game of all time in IGN 's feature reflecting on the Game Boy Advance 's long lifespan . 
 Final Fantasy VI is often regarded as one of the best titles in the series and one of the best role @-@ playing video games ever created . In 2005 , IGN placed Final Fantasy VI 56th on their list of the 100 greatest games , as the second highest ranked Final Fantasy title on the list after Final Fantasy IV . In 2006 , Nintendo Power ranked it as the 13th top 200 game on any Nintendo platform , suggesting that it might be the best Final Fantasy ever . That same year , readers of the Japanese magazine Famitsu voted it as the 25th best game of all time . In 2008 , Final Fantasy VI took the # 1 spot on G4 TV 's " Top Must Own RPGs " list . That same year , ScrewAttack named Final Fantasy VI the third best SNES game , beaten only by The Legend of Zelda : A Link to the Past and Super Metroid . In 2009 , Final Fantasy VI was inducted into the IGN Videogame Hall of Fame , becoming the second Final Fantasy game to do so ( the only other Final Fantasy to do so was the original Final Fantasy ) . In 2012 , also IGN put Final Fantasy VI as number one on their list of the top role @-@ playing video games , stating : " There are too many moments in Final Fantasy VI worthy of celebration to name them all . Biggs and Wedge leading Terra through the snow . The poisoning of Doma . Sandy boots . The destruction of the world . A tragic opera . Ultros ! We hold these close to our hearts , and that 's not even including Espers and the most poignant character themes in the series to date . So cheers , Final Fantasy VI . May your name follow us as we all tumble towards the future of art , entertainment , narrative , and everything that keeps us gaming . " In an updated version of the " Top 100 " list in 2007 , IGN ranked Final Fantasy VI as the ninth top game of all time , above all other Final Fantasy games in the series . They continued to cite the game 's character development , and especially noted Kefka as " one of the most memorable bad guys in RPG history . " In 2009 , Game Informer put the SNES version of Final Fantasy III eighth on their list of the top games of all time , opining that it " perfected the 2D role @-@ playing game . " It fell from its seventh @-@ place ranking the staff gave it in 2001 . 
 In 2012 , the staff of GamesRadar ranked it as the ninth best SNES game , stating that " for it to remain so effective and so moving for so long after its 1994 release means it is a true work of art , and demands to sit high atop any list , regardless of platform ( we did already name it the 14th best game of all time ) . "

 Final Fantasy VI : The Interactive CG Game ( also known as the Final Fantasy SGI demo , or Final Fantasy x , not related to the actual 10th game in the Final Fantasy series , Final Fantasy X ) was a short game demo produced by Square using characters and settings from Final Fantasy VI . Produced using new Silicon Graphics , Inc . ( SGI ) Onyx workstations acquired by Square , the demo was Square 's first foray into 3D graphics , and many assumed that it was a precursor to a new Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo 64 video game console , which also used SGI hardware . Square , however , had not yet committed to Nintendo 's console at the time of the demo 's production , and much of the technology demonstrated in the demo was later put to use in the rendering of FMV sequences for Final Fantasy VII and subsequent games for the PlayStation . The demo itself featured Terra Branford , Locke Cole , and Shadow in a series of battles . The game was controlled largely through mouse gestures : for example , moving the cursor in the shape of a star would summon a dragon to attack . 
 On April 27 , 2010 , Square Enix producer Shinji Hashimoto stated that the development of a remake of Final Fantasy VI for the Nintendo DS was " undecided " due to " technical issues " . Later , however , Square discussed remaking VI as well as V for the Nintendo 3DS . In 2015 , Tetsuya Nomura , director of the Final Fantasy VII remake , expressed interest in remaking Final Fantasy V and VI .

 Alexander Seropian ( born 1969 ) is an American video game developer , one of the initial founders and later president of Bungie Software Products Corporation , the developer of the Marathon , Myth , and Halo video game series . Seropian became interested in computer programming in college and teamed up with fellow student Jason Jones to publish Jones 's game Minotaur . The two became partners , and Bungie grew to become the best @-@ known Apple Macintosh game developer before being bought by Microsoft in 2001 . 
 In 2004 , Seropian left Bungie and created Wideload Games , with the goal of streamlining game development . Wideload 's small core development team worked with outside contractors to produce Stubbs the Zombie and Hail to the Chimp . Wideload was acquired by Disney in 2009 . As part of the deal Seropian became vice president of game development for Disney Interactive Studios . In 2012 he left the position to start Industrial Toys , a company focusing on mobile games .

 Alex Seropian attended the University of Chicago , and joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity , where he would soon meet one of his future colleagues Jason Jones . Interested in computer programming , Seropian was pursuing a mathematics degree with a concentration in computer science as the Department of Computer Science did not offer undergraduate degrees at the time . He graduated in 1991 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics . Before graduating , Seropian was living with his father , sleeping on his couch , and debating whether to get a job or create his own video game company . Seropian 's father advised him to take a job to get experience , but the next day Seropian decided to found his own company . " My dad is a master of reverse psychology " , Seropian said . 
 = = = Bungie = = = 
 Seropian 's first game was a self @-@ published Pong @-@ clone called Gnop ! . The Apple Macintosh @-@ exclusive game was free , although a few customers paid $ 15 for the game 's source code . In 1991 he founded Bungie and published his first commercial game , Operation Desert Storm . Seropian sold 2 @,@ 500 copies of the game , assembling the game boxes and mailing them out from his bedroom . Seropian partnered with his Artificial Intelligence classmate Jason Jones to publish Jones 's nearly complete Minotaur : The Labyrinths of Crete ; while the game sold only around 2 @,@ 500 copies — it required a then @-@ rare modem for network play — it developed a devoted following . After publishing Minotaur , the two formed a partnership . 
 For the next Bungie title , 1993 's Pathways Into Darkness , Seropian hired a third team member for graphics work . The game was the first three @-@ dimensional texture @-@ mapped game on the Mac and the first true first @-@ person shooter . By 1994 Bungie had grown to a staff of six and had moved into a rundown Chicago office — a converted former religious school located in front of a crack house . Their next title , Marathon , began development as a sequel to Pathways but grew larger . On release it won several awards and established Bungie as the top Mac game developer . 
 For the first game of the Halo series , Halo : Combat Evolved , Seropian noted that the company had to incorporate new features such as surround sound and cinematics . Halo went on to sell more than 4 million units by 2004 and founded a media franchise encompassing sequels , books , and music . Seropian left Bungie in 2002 to spend time with his new family , but also due to frustrations with the game development process .

 Seropian founded his own studio in 2004 called Wideload Games , intended to be more streamlined than most video game studios . Calling the current method of game development " broken " , Wideload began with a staff of 10 , with the plan to outsource the lion 's share of development , to stay within budget . Seropian said that the idea came from figuring out that his decade @-@ old assumptions about how to make games did not necessarily apply to the future . Seropian turned to the film industry for cues , saying that it helped to look at an older industry that had been solving the same types of problems for a longer period than video games . The external development model allowed Wideload to focus on the creative aspect of a project and added flexibility in what types of projects the team could take on . Wideload produced two games , 2005 's Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse and 2008 's Hail to the Chimp . 
 On September 8 , 2009 Disney acquired Wideload . Seropian joined Disney to head its in @-@ house game development team , Disney Interactive Studios . The sale of Wideload was not originally planned : Wideload and Disney began working on a title together , and as conversations turned to a " broader scope and vision " , the two companies " discovered [ they ] had a lot in common , " Seropian said .

 = Media Blitz = 
 " Media Blitz " is the fifth episode of the third season of the American comedy television series Parks and Recreation , and the 35th overall episode of the series . It originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 17 , 2011 . In the episode , the parks department tries to draw media attention for the upcoming harvest festival , but the press becomes fixated on Ben 's past political mistakes . Meanwhile , Andy Dwyer takes on all of April Ludgate 's errands with the hopes of convincing her not to move to Indianapolis . 
 Written by Harris Wittels and directed by David Rogers , " Media Blitz " revolved largely around Ben 's backstory as a child mayor who bankrupted his old town , which was originally a concept considered for series protagonist Leslie Knope . The episode was also what series co @-@ creator Michael Schur called a " key moment " for April and Andy , ending a multi @-@ episode subplot of April being angry with Andy for having been kissed by Ann in the second season finale " Freddy Spaghetti " . " Media Blitz " featured guest appearances by comedians Matt Besser and Nick Kroll as morning zoo @-@ style radio hosts " Crazy Ira and The Douche , " as well as appearance by frequent Parks and Recreation guest stars Mo Collins , Alison Becker , and Jay Jackson . 
 According to Nielsen Media Research , " Media Blitz " was seen by 4 @.@ 33 million household viewers . It marked the lowest rating for the season to date , and constituted a more than eight percent drop from the previous episode , " Ron & Tammy : Part Two " . " Media Blitz " received generally positive reviews , with several commentators particularly praising the performance of Adam Scott as Ben . Some reviews , however , found less effective a subplot about the uncertainty surrounding the romantic relationship of Ann and Chris Traeger , a state auditor played by Rob Lowe who is supposed to leave Pawnee for Indianapolis soon .
