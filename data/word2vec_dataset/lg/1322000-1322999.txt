 As Ethalion subdued Thetis the remainder of the British squadron continued southwards in pursuit of Santa Brigada . Pillon was an experienced officer with a good knowledge of the Northern Spanish coast and he intended to lose his pursuers in the rocky channels of Cape Finisterre . Early on 17 October he reached Spanish coastal waters , rounding Finisterre just beyond the Monte Lora rocks . Captain Gore on Triton , which was in full flow at seven knots , was unaware of the obstacle and at 05 : 00 crashed into them , coming to a juddering halt and inflicting severe damage to his ship 's hull . Gore was able however to bring Triton off soon afterwards and continued pursuit , assisted by Digby on Alcmene who was able to block Pillon 's route into Porte de <unk> . Both frigates opened fire on Santa Brigada at 07 : 00 as the Spanish ship sought shelter in the rocks at <unk> close to the safe harbour at Muros , Pillon 's movement hampered by the coastal <unk> that blocked the wind . After an hour of resistance , with Naiad belatedly approaching , Pillon was forced to surrender his ship to superior British forces . Santa Brigada had lost two men killed and eight wounded , Alcmene one killed and nine wounded and Triton a single man wounded . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 As the British force took control of Santa Brigada , a Spanish squadron of four ships sailed from Vigo with the appearance of intending to bring Pierrepont 's squadron to battle . Pierrepont immediately issued orders for his ships to meet with the Spanish who promptly turned about and returned to port without coming within range . A shore breeze enabled the British ships and their prize to extricate themselves from the <unk> rocks without further damage . They then sailed directly for the fleet base at Plymouth , arriving on 22 October to find that Thetis and Ethalion had reached the port the day before . Dispatches were sent to Lord Bridport , commander of the Channel Fleet , which were then forwarded to the Admiralty and revealed the scale of the prize . 
 Aboard Thetis was found a quantity of trade cocoa and a series of boxes containing coin , including 333 boxes of 3 @,@ 000 dollars each , four boxes of 2 @,@ 385 dollars each , 94 boxes containing 4 @,@ 000 dollars each and two golden doubloons and 90 golden half @-@ doubloons . This totalled 1 @,@ 385 @,@ 292 silver dollars , with a sterling value of £ 311 @,@ 690 . On Santa Brigada were trade cocoa , sugar , indigo and cochineal worth in total about £ 5 @,@ 000 as well as 446 boxes containing 3 @,@ 000 dollars each , 59 bags and three kegs of dollars and numerous loose coins , for a total value of at least 1 @,@ 338 @,@ 000 silver dollars or £ 301 @,@ 350 . Altogether the sterling value of the cargo was calculated as not less than £ 618 @,@ 040 ( the equivalent of £ 54 @,@ 762 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) . The captured ships however were written off as worthless , although some additional money was made auctioning off their naval stores . In the aftermath , the sailors of the squadron were noted in the streets of Portsmouth wearing " bank notes stuck in their hats , buying watches for the fun of frying them , and issuing laws that any of their crew who appeared without a gold @-@ laced hat should be <unk> , so that the unlucky man who appeared in silver could only escape by representing that the costlier articles were all bought up , but he had compelled the shopkeeper to take money for gold lace . " 
 This vast sum of money was transported through Plymouth on 63 wagons , guarded by armed sailors and Royal Marines and accompanied by musical bands and cheering crowds to the security of the Royal Citadel . It remained in Plymouth until November when it was removed to London with considerable ceremony and placed at the Bank of England . The sums awarded as prize money , distributed in equal proscribed shares among the crews of Ethalion , Naiad , Alcmene and Triton were among the largest ever recorded . Each captain was given £ 40 @,@ 730 ( of which a third was due to the admiral in command ) , each lieutenant £ 5 @,@ 091 , each warrant officer £ 2 @,@ 468 , each midshipman £ 791 and each sailor or marine £ 182 . For the regular seamen , this total was 15 times their annual pay of £ 12 . As historian James Henderson noted " even the humblest seaman could set himself up with a cosy pub " . For the captains , normally paid £ 150 a year , this was more money than they could make in 270 years . On the only subsequent occasion when a Spanish treasure fleet was successfully intercepted , at the Battle of Cape Santa Maria in October 1804 , an even greater haul was captured . On that occasion however the Admiralty used an obscure regulation to seize the bulk of the prize and the captains only received around £ 15 @,@ 000 each . 
 Historian Richard Woodman has noted that this action illustrates both the dominance of the Royal Navy and its high standards at this stage in the war , stating that " The coincidental appearance of four frigates in the vast Atlantic testifies to the enormous resources the British put into the prosecution of the war . That the four frigate captains proceeded to act in such perfect concert is further evidence , if it were needed , of the shared standards of mutual help and assistance " . 
 = HMS St Vincent ( 1908 ) = 
 HMS St Vincent was the lead ship of her class of three dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century . She spent her whole career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets and often served as a flagship . Aside from participating in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 , during which she damaged a German battlecruiser , her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea . The ship was deemed obsolete after the war and was reduced to reserve and used as a training ship . St Vincent was sold for scrap in 1921 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The design of the St Vincent class was derived from that of the previous Bellerophon class . St Vincent had an overall length of 536 feet ( 163 @.@ 4 m ) , a beam of 84 feet ( 25 @.@ 6 m ) , and a normal draught of 28 feet ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) . She displaced 19 @,@ 700 long tons ( 20 @,@ 000 t ) at normal load and 22 @,@ 800 long tons ( 23 @,@ 200 t ) at deep load . In 1911 her crew numbered 756 officers and enlisted men and 835 in 1915 . 
 = = = Machinery = = = 
 St Vincent was powered by 2 sets of Parsons direct @-@ drive steam turbines , each driving two shafts , using steam from eighteen Babcock & Wilcox boilers . The turbines were rated at 24 @,@ 500 shp ( 18 @,@ 300 kW ) and intended to reach a maximum speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . During her sea trials on 17 December 1909 , the ship reached a top speed of 21 @.@ 67 knots ( 40 @.@ 13 km / h ; 24 @.@ 94 mph ) from 28 @,@ 218 shp ( 21 @,@ 042 kW ) . She had a range of 6 @,@ 900 nautical miles ( 12 @,@ 800 km ; 7 @,@ 900 mi ) at a cruising speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The St Vincent class was equipped with ten breech @-@ loading ( BL ) 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) Mk XI guns in five twin gun turrets , three along the centreline and the remaining two as wing turrets . The secondary , or anti @-@ torpedo boat armament , comprised twenty BL 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) Mk VII guns . Two of these guns were each installed on the roofs of the fore and aft centreline turrets and the wing turrets in unshielded mounts , and the other ten were positioned in the superstructure . All guns were in single mounts . The ships were also fitted with three 18 @-@ inch torpedo tubes , one on each broadside and the third in the stern . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The St Vincent @-@ class ships had a waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour ( KC ) that was 10 inches ( 254 mm ) thick between the fore and aftmost barbettes that reduced to a thickness of 2 inches ( 51 mm ) before it reached the ships ' ends . Above this was a strake of armour 8 inches ( 203 mm ) thick . Transverse bulkheads 5 to 8 inches ( 127 to 203 mm ) inches thick terminated the thickest parts of the waterline and upper armour belts once they reached the outer portions of the endmost barbettes . 
 The three centreline barbettes were protected by armour 9 inches ( 229 mm ) thick above the main deck that thinned to 5 inches ( 127 mm ) below it . The wing barbettes were similar except that they had 10 inches of armour on their outer faces . The gun turrets had 11 @-@ inch ( 279 mm ) faces and sides with 3 inches ( 76 mm ) roofs . The three armoured decks ranged in thicknesses from .75 to 3 inches ( 19 to 76 mm ) . The front and sides of the forward conning tower were protected by 11 @-@ inch plates , although the rear and roof were 8 inches and 3 inches thick respectively . 
 = = = = Alterations = = = = 
 The guns on the forward turret roof were removed in 1911 – 12 and the upper forward pair of guns in the superstructure were removed in 1913 – 14 . In addition , gun shields were fitted to all guns in the superstructure and the bridge structure was enlarged around the base of the forward tripod mast . During the first year of the war , a fire @-@ control director was installed high on the forward tripod mast . Around the same time , the base of the forward superstructure was rebuilt to house four 4 @-@ inch guns and the turret @-@ top guns were removed , which reduced her secondary armament to a total of fourteen guns . In addition a pair of 3 @-@ inch anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns were added . 
 By April 1917 , St Vincent mounted thirteen 4 @-@ inch anti @-@ torpedo boat guns as well as single 4 @-@ inch and 3 @-@ inch AA guns . Approximately 50 long tons ( 51 t ) of additional deck armour had been added after the Battle of Jutland and the ship was modified to operate a kite balloon . In 1918 a high @-@ angle rangefinder was fitted and the stern torpedo tube was removed before the end of the war . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 St Vincent , named after Admiral of the Fleet John Jervis , 1st Earl of St Vincent , was ordered on 26 October 1907 . She was laid down at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard on the same date ; launched on 10 September 1908 and completed in May 1909 . Including her armament , her cost is variously quoted at £ 1 @,@ 579 @,@ 970 or £ 1 @,@ 754 @,@ 615 . She was commissioned on 3 May 1910 and assigned as the junior flagship of the 1st Division of the Home Fleet . She was commanded by Captain Douglas Nicholson and was present in Torbay when King George V visited the fleet in late July . St Vincent also participated in the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 24 June 1911 . On 1 May 1912 the 1st Division was renamed the 1st Battle Squadron . The ship participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead before beginning a lengthy refit late in the year . 
 On 21 April 1914 , she was recommissioned and resumed her role as the flagship of the second @-@ in @-@ command of the 2nd Division , 1st Battle Squadron , under the command of Rear @-@ Admiral Hugh Evan @-@ Thomas . Between 17 and 20 July , she took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review . On 29 July she sailed to the fleet 's war station at Scapa Flow and began the patrols and training exercises that constituted the greater part of her service after the declaration of war on 4 August . She was briefly based ( 22 October to 3 November ) with the greater part of the fleet at Lough Swilly while the defences at Scapa were strengthened . King George V inspected all of the personnel of the 2nd Division aboard St Vincent during his visit to Scapa on 8 July 1915 . She became a private ship in November when she was relieved by Colossus as flagship . 
 = = = Battle of Jutland = = = 
 St Vincent , under the command of Captain William Fisher , was assigned to the 5th Division of the 1st Battle Squadron at the Battle of Jutland . Shortly after 14 : 20 , Fisher <unk> the Grand Fleet 's flagship , Iron Duke , that his ship was monitoring strong radio signals on the frequency used by the German High Seas Fleet that implied the Germans were nearby . Detection of further signals was transmitted at 14 : 52 . 
 As the Grand Fleet began deploying from columns into line of battle beginning at 18 : 15 , the 5th Division was near the rear and St Vincent , the twentieth ship from the front , was briefly forced to stop to avoid overrunning ships further forward as the fleet had been forced to slow to 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) to allow the battlecruisers to assume their position at the head of the line . During the first stage of the general engagement , the ship fired a few salvos from her main guns at the crippled light cruiser SMS Wiesbaden from 18 : 33 , although the number of hits made , if any , is unknown . Between 18 : 40 and 19 : 00 the ship turned away twice from what were thought to be torpedoes that stopped short of the ship . From 19 : 10 St Vincent began firing at what was identified as a German battleship , but proved to be the battlecruiser SMS Moltke , hitting her target twice before she disappeared into the mist . The first armor @-@ piercing , capped ( APC ) shell was probably a ricochet and struck the upper hull abreast the bridge . It wrecked the sickbay and slightly damaged the surrounding superstructure and hull which caused some minor flooding . One man in the conning tower was wounded by a splinter . The second hit penetrated the rear armor of the superfiring turret at the rear of the ship , wrecking it and starting a small fire that was easily extinguished by the crew . This was the last time that St Vincent fired her guns during the battle . The ship fired a total of 90 APC and 8 Common Pointed , Capped twelve @-@ inch shells during the battle . 
 Shortly after the battle , she was transferred to the 4th Battle Squadron . On 24 April 1918 , St Vincent was under repair at Invergordon when she , and the dreadnought Hercules were ordered north to reinforce the forces based at Scapa Flow and the Orkneys when the High Seas Fleet sortied north for the last time to intercept a convoy to Norway . She was unable to comply with the order before the Germans turned back after Moltke suffered engine damage . The ship was present at Rosyth when the German fleet surrendered on 21 November . In March 1919 , she was reduced to reserve and became a gunnery training ship at Portsmouth . St Vincent became flagship of the Reserve Fleet in June and was relieved as gunnery training ship in December when she was transferred to Rosyth . There she remained until listed for disposal in March 1921 . She was sold to the Stanlee Shipbreaking & Salvage Co. for scrap on 1 December 1921 and towed to Dover for demolition in March 1922 . 
 = Ivatan people = 
 The Ivatans are a Filipino ethnolinguistic group predominant in the Batanes Islands of the Philippines . The origins of the Ivatans remained <unk> among scholars . Ivatans were free before they were colonized by the Spaniards . 
 The culture of the Ivatans is partly influenced by the environmental condition of Batanes . Unlike the old @-@ type <unk> huts common in the Philippines , Ivatans have adopted their now @-@ famous stone houses made of limestone , designed to protect against the hostile climate . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Documents do not show much about the history of the Ivatans and at present , scholars who study their origins are still unsure as to their exact origin . They question whether the pre @-@ historic Ivatans came from the northern part of Luzon or southern portions of China and Taiwan . There is evidence that they might be a surviving Christianized remnant of a people that once resided on all the islands between Luzon and Taiwan . However , they have considered the close racial resemblance of the Ivatans to the Malays and the structure of their language could mean they came from other parts of the Philippines . Tracing their roots through Batanes ' folklores , genetic studies of <unk> , a Japanese anthropologist , of the Yami of Orchid Island ( <unk> ) show closer genetic affinity of the Yami to the Tagalog and Visayan and linguistically to the <unk> ( <unk> ) sub @-@ branch of the Malayo @-@ Polynesian branch . 
 = = Early settlement = = 
 Ivatans already lived in Batanes before the Spaniards arrived in the Philippines in the 16th century , and lived autonomously long thereafter . On June 26 , 1783 Batanes was incorporated to the Spanish East Indies . In 1571 the capital of the Spanish colony in the Philippines was established in Manila . In 1686 , Ivatans were " forced " to settle in the lowlands of Batanes . The Ivatans were under Spanish rule for 115 years , and gained their independence on September 18 , 1898 . Ironically , June 6 is celebrated in Batanes as its founding day . 
 = = Physical attributes = = 
 One of the earliest accounts of the Ivatan is that of the British <unk> William Dampier in 1687 . Dampier described them as " short , squat people ; hazel eyes , small yet bigger than Chinese ; low foreheads ; thick eyebrows ; short low noses ; white teeth ; black thick hair ; and very dark , copper @-@ colored skin . " They also have strong mixture of the short type of the Mongols , and there are some individuals who seem to have some physical characteristics peculiar to the <unk> of Japan . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 In 1990 , population of the Ivatans was 15 @,@ 026 , an increase of 24 % over the 1980 population of 12 @,@ 091 . These were distributed to the six municipalities , with 38 % residing in Basco , 23 % in <unk> , 12 % in <unk> , 11 % in <unk> and 8 % for <unk> and Ivana . In the 2000 census , 15 @,@ 834 Ivatans were among the 16 @,@ 421 population in Batanes . 
 The mother tongue of the Ivatans is the <unk> nu <unk> , but is commonly known as Ivatan . A distinct Austronesian language , the Ivatan has two dialects including the Basco , the <unk> and possibly the Yami . The Ivatans widely speak and understand the Ilocano , Tagalog , and English languages . 
 Today , most Ivatans are Catholics , like the rest of the country , although some have not converted practice ancestral worship to their <unk> . However , there are growing Protestant denominations specially in the capital town of Batanes . 
 = = Culture = = 
 The Ivatan 's culture have been largely influenced by the climate of Batanes . Exposed to high risks of disruption to their agriculture , Ivatans have adopted strategies in order to live . Traditionally , because of the frequent typhoons and drought , they plant root crops able to cope with the environment . These crops include yam , sweet potato , taro , garlic , ginger and onion , as they ensure higher chances of survival during awry climate conditions . The Ivatan study the behavior of animals , sky color , wind and clouds to predict the weather . The Ivatans usually gather their animals and stay in their houses when they see that the cows take shelter from the <unk> ( communal pasture ) and birds taking refuge in houses or in the ground . A pink sky with an orange hue also heralds a storm . The sea is vital to the Ivatan 's way of life . Although abundant only in the month of March to May , they depend on the flying fish ( <unk> ) and dolphinfish ( <unk> ) present on the shores of Batanes . They have a native delicacy called <unk> ( the pith of the banana stalk ) which is served , along with the wine <unk> , on festive occasions such as weddings . 
 Before Spaniards arrived at the Philippines , Ivatans built their houses largely from cogon grass , small and well situated , designed to protect against strong winds . The Spaniards introduced large @-@ scale production of lime for the construction of their now @-@ famous stone houses . With meter @-@ thick limestone walls , the type of their infrastructures are designed against the harsh Batanes environment , which is known as a terminal passage of typhoons in the Philippines . The basic cogon grass is still preserved as roofs of their houses , thickly constructed to withstand strong winds . These houses are comparable to the white houses in New Zealand , Ireland and Scottish Highlands . 
 One of the endemic clothing of the Ivatans is the <unk> . A <unk> is a headgear designed to protect the wearer from sun and rain . It is made from abaca fiber of the <unk> palm . 
 The Ivatan have three different folk songs : the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> . The <unk> are ancient lyrical songs that are supposed to be sung when they are merry or just finished work . The <unk> on the other hand is sung during work . The Ivatan also have legends that are called <unk> . They also have the <unk> , chants that chronicle the adventures of the Ivatan 's forefathers as they escape a disaster . 
 = Principality of Nitra = 
 The Principality of Nitra ( Slovak : <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) also known as the Duchy of Nitra , was a Slavic polity encompassing a group of settlements that developed in the 9th century around Nitra in present @-@ day Slovakia . Its history remains uncertain because of a lack of contemporary sources . The territory 's status is subject to scholarly debate ; some modern historians describe it as an independent polity that was annexed either around 833 or 870 by Principality of Moravia while others say that it was under influence of the neighbouring Slavs from Moravia from its inception . 
 = = Background = = 
 Modern @-@ day Slovakia was dominated for centuries by Germanic peoples , including the Quadi and the <unk> or Lombards , who were there until the middle of the 6th century . A new material culture characterized by handmade pottery , cremation burials and small , square , sunken huts that typically featured a corner stone oven appeared in the plains along the Middle Danube around that time . The new culture , with its " spartan and egalitarian " nature , sharply differed from the earlier archaeological cultures of Central Europe . According to Barford , a report by the Byzantine historian Procopius is the first certain reference to Early Slav groups inhabiting parts of present @-@ day Slovakia . Procopius wrote that an exiled Lombard prince named <unk> mustered an army , " taking with him not only those of the Lombards who had followed him , but also many of the Sclaveni " in the 540s . 
 The nomadic Avars , who arrived from the Eurasian steppes , invaded the Carpathian Basin and subjected the local inhabitants in the second half of the 6th century . Thereafter , Slavic groups inhabiting areas around the core regions of the Avar Khaganate paid tribute to the Avars . The khaganate experienced a series of internal conflicts in the 630s . According to the Chronicle of <unk> , the " Slavs who are known as Wends " rebelled against the Avars and elected a Frankish trader named Samo as their king in the early 7th century . Samo 's realm , which emerged in the northern or northwestern regions of the Carpathian Basin , existed for more than three decades . It disintegrated soon after its founder 's death and Avar control of the region was restored . 
 The Avar Khaganate collapsed around 803 as a result of several successful military campaigns launched by the Franks against it . The fall of the Khaganate contributed to the rise of new polities among the Slavs in the region . The shift in political control was accompanied by changes in military strategy and equipment . According to Curta , swords and other items of the " <unk> @-@ <unk> horizon " show " a shift from the mounted combat tactics typical of nomadic warfare to heavy cavalry equipment " , and the development of a local elite in the regions to the north of the river Danube and the Great Hungarian Plain in the early 9th century . 
 = = Scholarly debates : the status and location of Pribina 's Nitrava = = 
 According to a widely accepted interpretation of the Conversion , Pribina was initially the ruler of an independent polity which was centered on Nitra . For instance , Barford writes that Pribina " was apparently prince of Nitra " . Pribina 's assumed realm is described as the " first demonstrable Slavic state north of the middle Danube " by Lukačka . Lukačka also says that Pribina had a retinue and that most its members " certainly descended from the former tribal aristocracy " but some of them " could have come from the free strata of the mass of the people " . Richard <unk> says that it " can hardly be unambiguously decided whether Pribina was prince of a greater tribe or of two or three smaller joined tribes " . He adds that Pribina may have belonged to the second or third generation of the heads of this polity , which emerged in the valleys of the rivers Hron , Nitra , and <unk> . 
 Scholars who write that Pribina was an independent ruler also say that his principality was united with Moravia after he was exiled from his homeland . <unk> and Steinhübel add that the forced unification of the two principalities – Mojmir 's Moravia and Pribina 's Nitra – under Mojmir gave rise to the empire of Great Moravia . According to <unk> , the inhabitants of Pribina 's principality who " definitely were aware of their difference from the Moravian Slavs " preserved their " specific consciousness " even within Great Moravia , which contributed to the development of the common consciousness of the ancestors of the Slovak people . 
 Pribina was not an independent ruler , but Duke Mojmir of Moravia 's lieutenant in Nitra , according to Vlasto . He says that Pribina 's attempts to achieve independence led to his exile . The identification of " Nitra " with " Nitrava " is not universally accepted by scholars . Imre Boba and Charles Bowlus are among the scholars who challenged that identification . Imre Boba says , the Humanist historian , Johannes Aventinus , who identified Nitrava ( granted along with Brno and Olomouc by Louis the German , according to Aventinus ) with Nitra , because Nitrava was in " <unk> or <unk> " , to the south of Bavaria . He also says that the Latin term " locus Nitrava " could not refer to a city . According to his view , none of the modern names of Nitra ( Slovak Nitra , Hungarian Nyitra and German Neutra ) could develop from a " Nitrava " form . Boba 's linguistic approach is not compliant with onomastic research which suggests that Nitra was the primary form of the place name and " Nitrava " is only the secondary name ; both forms were recorded already in the 9th century . The Czech historian Dušan <unk> , who says that the association of Nitra with Nitrava cannot be challenged , writes that the latter form developed from the name of the Nitra River , which fits well into the system of Indo @-@ European toponyms ; other rivers with similar names are not known . Charles Bowlus also rejects the identification of Nitrava with Nitra , because the latter town was only annexed by Moravia during the reign of Svatopluk , years after Pribina 's expulsion , according to a letter that Archbishop Theotmar of Salzburg and his suffragans wrote around 900 . According to <unk> , the content of the letter can be explained as a reasonable mistake of its <unk> who knew that the territory was in the past a separate realm different from Moravia . 
 = Briarcliff High School = 
 Briarcliff High School ( BHS ) is a public secondary school in Briarcliff Manor , New York that serves students in grades 9 – 12 . It is the only high school in the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District , sharing its campus with Briarcliff Middle School . As of 2014 , the principal is Debora French and the assistant principal is Daniel Murphy . 
 Briarcliff is noted for outstanding student achievement , testing scores and accomplishments , including a highly regarded science research program , world language and performing arts programs , University in the High School and Advanced Placement courses , and graduation and college attendance rates . The school has an 11 : 1 student – teacher ratio , and nearly every student has at least grade @-@ level proficiency in mathematics and English . 
 The student body primarily consists of graduates from Briarcliff Middle School . Additionally , students graduating from Pocantico Hills Central School have the option to attend high school either at Briarcliff High School , Pleasantville High School , or Sleepy Hollow High School . The majority , 75 percent in 2013 , attend Briarcliff High School . Students from Pocantico Hills as well as other districts pay a tuition fee to attend . In 2015 , Newsweek ranked the high school 31st @-@ best in the country . The school was founded in 1928 at the Grade School building adjacent to Law Memorial Park . In 1971 , the school moved to its current facility on the east border of the village . 
 = = History = = 
 From 1865 until 1918 , Briarcliff Manor served students up to the ninth grade . Before 1918 , Briarcliff students who wanted to proceed to high school would attend the nearby Ossining High School . After 1918 , Briarcliff introduced an advanced curriculum for high school students . In 1923 , four students were the first in a Briarcliff school to receive high school diplomas . In 1928 , with the entrance of additional high school students , an extension was added to the Spanish Renaissance @-@ style Grade School for use as Briarcliff High School . The building was located adjacent to the Walter W. Law Memorial Park . The enlarged school accepted students from Croton , Hawthorne , North White Plains , Valhalla , and as far as Granite Springs . 
 The high school newspaper , The Briarcliff Bulletin , was founded in 1948 . As Briarcliff 's student population expanded , the need for more school facilities became apparent . In 1950 , students from kindergarten to fifth grade were moved to the new Todd Elementary School . In spite of the newly empty space in the Grade School building , the high school population 's continued growth necessitated the construction of a new structure . Efforts were delayed until the 1960s , when the village government made plans to purchase 55 acres ( 22 ha ) of the Choate estate . Pace University , however , purchased the entire estate , and it remains its Pleasantville campus . The Briarcliff Manor Board of Education took the matter to court and succeeded , and Pace sold 35 acres ( 14 ha ) to the village , which bought eight additional acres . 
 The new site was completed in 1968 , and the current high school building opened in 1971 . In the 1980s , as school enrollment declined and costs increased , the Grade School building was leased to Pace University and the remaining students in that building ( grades six through eight ) occupied a portion of the new High School building . In 1988 , a plan for a larger village and school meeting and performance area was initiated . A new auditorium was completed in 1998 . After a bond vote in 2001 , the current Briarcliff Middle School was constructed in the early 2000s adjoining the high school . 
 In the summer and fall of 2011 , several renovations took place , affecting primarily the high school . All front @-@ facing windows of the high school were replaced with energy @-@ efficient windows , and a permanent @-@ storage building was constructed on the northeast side to store auditorium and maintenance supplies . In addition , many of the computers in the school were replaced with thin client computers . In 2013 , the school 's cardiovascular and weight lifting center was improved with more machines and equipment , increased space , new flat screen televisions , and other additions . In 2013 and 2014 , the school 's fields on the property were remediated due to the use of contaminated fill . The football field was completed with artificial turf , as well as the track and artificial turf baseball field ; an artificial turf hockey field was to be completed by Labor Day . The lower soccer field will be reconstructed after the fall 2014 soccer season . Work on the softball field was finished in fall 2013 . A security plan is to be submitted to the New York State Education Department ; it includes plans to upgrade the main entrance doors and construct vestibules and greeter stations .

 As of 2014 , the school had 587 students , including 81 from the Pocantico Hills Central School , comprising 13 @.@ 8 percent of the student body . Students in the graduating class of 2013 had a 100 percent graduation rate and a 99 percent college placement rate . 99 percent of those students graduated with a Regents diploma , 50 percent with Advanced Designation with Honors , 21 percent with Advanced Designation , and 3 percent obtained Regents with Honors . 24 percent graduated with a standard Regents diploma and 1 percent with a local diploma .

The high school prides itself on its arts curricula , and produces musicals and dramatic productions at the school auditorium , which was built in 1998 and seats 500 . In 2010 , it was renamed for former Superintendent Frances G. Wills . The auditorium has hosted other Briarcliff shows and events , including the Centennial Variety Show from April 26 – 27 , 2002 , arranged by the nine @-@ member Briarcliff Manor Centennial Committee for the village 's centennial celebration . The school was the first US high school to perform the British musical The Hired Man , from March 7 – 9 , 2014 . 
 The school is known for its annual musicals , which often sell out . The school also reaches out to professionals who volunteer their time ; the assistant director at the Studio Theater ( also the son of Frances G. Wills ) ran a workshop on proper casting and auditions for the students and arranged for Children of Eden creator Stephen Schwartz to visit the school during its 2002 production of his musical . 
 Briarcliff is often recognized at the annual awards ceremony at the Helen Hayes Youth Theatre in Nyack , ceremonies which are held in early June with awards in numerous categories , modeled after the Tony Award . Their 2002 performance of Children of Eden earned ten nominations and three awards , for overall production , actor in a lead role , and director . The school spent $ 23 @,@ 000 on the production to pay for royalties , stipends for teachers acting as choreographers , musical directors and rehearsal accompanists , and for external workers to help students improve the production 's lighting , sets and sound . For their 2003 production of Footloose , the school 's musical director Kathleen Donovan @-@ Warren rented multicolored stage lighting and hired an electric guitarist as one of three professional musicians who played along with the student orchestra . There was a tradition in the musicals for the superintendent to have a cameo in the show , up until around 1999 .

 = Metroid Fusion = 
 Metroid Fusion is an action @-@ adventure video game published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console . The fourth installment in the Metroid series , it was developed by the company 's Research & Development 1 ( R & D1 ) division — the same team that previously developed the 1994 game Super Metroid , to which Fusion bears heavy resemblance . It was released in North America , Europe , and Australia in November 2002 , and in Japan in February 2003 . 
 The game 's story follows bounty hunter Samus Aran , who is sent by the Galactic Federation to investigate the Biologic Space Laboratories space station , where it is swarming with organisms infected with virions known as the X Parasites . Like in previous Metroid games , Fusion is played from the side @-@ scrolling perspective . It introduces mission @-@ based gameplay that aids the player to explore areas . The game consists of objectives , which are flexible in how they can be accomplished . Fusion was released simultaneously with the GameCube game Metroid Prime in North America . The bonus features in Prime can be unlocked by linking between the game and Fusion via the Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable . 
 Metroid Fusion received critical acclaim from critics , who praised the game for its action @-@ oriented gameplay . Fusion received several awards , including Handheld Game of the Year at the 2002 Interactive Achievement Awards , Best Game Boy Advance Adventure Game from IGN , and Best Action Game on Game Boy Advance from GameSpot . The game was released as a Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console title in December 2011 , as part of the " 3DS Ambassadors " program . The Wii U Virtual Console version was later released in April 2014 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Metroid Fusion is an action @-@ adventure platform shooter in which the player controls Samus Aran . Like previous games in the series , Metroid Fusion is set in a large open @-@ ended world with elevators that connect regions , which each in turn contains rooms separated by doors . Samus opens most doors by shooting at them , while some only open after she reaches a certain point . Metroid Fusion unfolds in a more linear manner than previous Metroid games due to its focus on storyline ; for example , Navigation Rooms are introduced in Metroid Fusion , which tell the player where to go . The gameplay revolves around solving puzzles to uncover secrets , platform jumping , and shooting enemies while searching for power @-@ ups that allow Samus to reach new areas . Injected with a Metroid vaccine in Metroid Fusion , Samus can absorb X Parasites that restore health , missiles , and bombs . Power @-@ ups can be obtained either by downloading them in Data Rooms , or absorbing a Core @-@ X , which appears after defeating each boss . Metroid Fusion includes gameplay mechanics new to the series such as the ability to grab ledges and climb ladders . 
 Owners of both Metroid Prime and Metroid Fusion can unlock new features in Metroid Prime using the Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable . After completing Metroid Prime , the player can unlock Samus 's Fusion Suit for use in Metroid Prime , and if they complete Metroid Fusion , they can unlock an emulated version of the first Metroid game . Players can also link Metroid Fusion to Metroid : Zero Mission to unlock a Metroid Fusion picture gallery , which includes additional concept art and extra images from the Japanese version of Metroid Fusion which chronicle Samus 's early years . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Bounty hunter Samus Aran , the protagonist , explores the surface of the planet SR388 with a survey crew from Biologic Space Laboratories ( BSL ) . She encounters the X Parasites , virions that can replicate their hosts ' physical appearances and memories , killing them afterward . Samus is unknowingly infected by the virus , and proceeds to return to the BSL station , when she suddenly loses consciousness and is ejected from her ship before it crashes into a nearby asteroid belt . The Galactic Federation recovers her body and discovers that the X Parasite infected Samus 's central nervous system . They counteract the parasite 's damage by creating a vaccine made from a remaining cell culture of the infant Metroid that Samus had previously contacted , as the Metroids were the X 's main predators on SR388 . The vaccine cures Samus and not only gives her the ability to absorb and use the nuclei of X Parasites for nourishment , but also burdens her with the Metroids ' vulnerability to cold . Her infected Power Suit is sent to the BSL station for examination , although parts of the suit were too integrated with her body to safely remove during surgery , forming a partially armored suit called the Fusion Suit . 
 When Samus recovers consciousness , she discovers that an explosion has occurred on board the BSL station . She is sent to investigate . The mission is overseen by her new gunship 's computer whom Samus nicknames " Adam " , after her former commanding officer , Adam Malkovich . Soon after her arrival , Samus discovers that the X have infected the station with the help of the " SA @-@ X , " an X parasite mimicking Samus at full power . Samus narrowly avoids the SA @-@ X on several occasions as she continues to explore the space station , completing various objectives such as saving the sentient Etecoons and <unk> still on board the ship . By using Data Rooms and defeating larger creatures infected by the X , Samus begins to recover her various abilities . She later discovers a restricted lab containing Metroids . Suddenly , the SA @-@ X appears , and in an attempt to destroy the Metroids sets off the restricted labs ' auto @-@ destruct sequence . Samus escapes but the lab is destroyed . Discovering this , the computer chastises Samus for ignoring her orders , and admits that the Federation was secretly using the lab to breed Metroids . It also reveals that the SA @-@ X managed to asexually reproduce before perishing , subsequently cloning itself ; in light of this , the computer advises Samus to leave the station . 
 On her way to her ship , the computer orders Samus to leave the rest of the investigation to the Federation , which plans to capture SA @-@ X for military purposes . Knowing that the X would only infect the arriving Federation troops and absorb their spacefaring knowledge to conquer the universe , Samus announces her intention to destroy the station . Although the computer initially intends to stop Samus , after Samus calls it " Adam , " the computer suggests that she alter the station 's propulsion to intercept with SR388 and destroy the planet to destroy all X populations . En route to initiate the propulsion sequence , Samus confronts an SA @-@ X , defeats it , and sets the BSL station on a collision course with SR388 . As she prepares to exit the station , she is stopped by an Omega Metroid which injures Samus towards an inch of her life . She is only saved by the recently defeated SA @-@ X. Samus absorbs the nucleus of this SA @-@ X and uses her newly restored Ice Beam to destroy the Omega Metroid . Her ship arrives , piloted by the Etecoons and <unk> , and they escape before the station impacts the planet . The computerized CO reveals that it is the consciousness of Adam Malkovich , uploaded after death . 
 = = Development = = 
 Metroid Fusion was developed by Nintendo Research & Development 1 ( R & D1 ) , the same development team that created the 1994 video game Super Metroid for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System , which visually bears a resemblance to Metroid Fusion . Its gameplay , screen layout , and controls mimic those of Super Metroid , with minor enhancements . Metroid Fusion is the first 2D Metroid game with animated cut scenes ; the game 's story is revealed through text and visual close @-@ ups . Metroid Fusion was written and directed by series co @-@ creator Yoshio Sakamoto , and produced by Takehiro <unk> . While brainstorming for ideas to the game 's plot , Sakamoto decided to create an original story instead of remaking a Metroid game because he " always [ tries ] to do something really unprecedented , something people have never played before " . He continued , saying , " Many of our designers and creators want to challenge something new rather than simply porting over an old title . That 's something I hope we 'll always do . If you can challenge something new , you can look forward to the public response , be it good or bad . " The game introduces gameplay mechanics that are new to the Metroid series . Metroid Fusion offers a more direct , almost mission @-@ based structure that supports the player to explore areas . Objectives are also flexible in how they can be completed , acting " more as a guide for what the player should do instead of giving a completely blank map and saying ' Here you go , figure out what to do and how to do it ' " . 
 According to the lead programmer Katsuya Yamano , Nintendo R & D1 did not consult previous Metroid games , and instead used their previously developed game Wario Land 4 as a reference in order to program Metroid Fusion . The game 's system director Takehiko Hosokawa states that while parts of the old gameplay remain in Fusion , the developers decided to introduce new elements to the game . Samus 's suit was revamped for Fusion ; Hosokawa said that this was because an X Parasite has attacked Samus and made her lose all her abilities . The missiles from previous games were also changed , leading an addition of two new types : the Ice Missiles — which has an similar effect to the Ice Beam — and a more @-@ powerful Diffusion Missiles . Other abilities were added to Fusion ; such as climbing walls and ceilings , and absorbing X Parasites to replenish health . 
 Nintendo first confirmed an unnamed Metroid title would be released for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console on March 23 , 2001 . Despite speculation that the game would be based on Super Metroid , Ken Lobb , Nintendo of America 's Director of Game Development , quelled rumors by stating , " One of the things I wanted to get across in today 's meeting is that Metroid is not Super Metroid . It 's something new . [ ... ] And that 's something that will hopefully be seen at E3 for our sweet little Game Boy Advance . " The first video footage from the game , a 10 @-@ second clip , was shown to the public on May 18 , 2001 , at the 2001 Electronic Entertainment Expo ; by then , the game was titled Metroid IV . At the E3 convention the following year , IGN awarded the game , titled Metroid Fusion , their Best of Show and Best Action Game awards . The game was scheduled for a release date of November 18 , 2002 . On August 22 , 2002 , Nintendo announced that the game can connect to Metroid Prime for the GameCube , a Metroid game that was released on the same day as Fusion . 
 = = = Audio = = = 
 The music for Metroid Fusion was composed by Minako Hamano and Akira Fujiwara . According to Hamano , Sakamoto wanted her to create music in accordance with Adam 's dialogue . Hamano aimed for " serious , ambient music rather than melody " because she did not want the exploration themes to be " annoying " . She also borrowed jingles that were previously used in Super Metroid , and arranged them for Fusion . As Nintendo of America wanted the developers to look for " Hollywood @-@ like " voice actors , Hamano added a voice of an announcer . The developers were planning on featuring voice acting into the game , but the voices were only used for warning announcements due to ROM cartridge limitations . 
 A two @-@ disc album , Metroid Prime & Fusion Original Soundtracks , was published by Scitron on June 18 , 2003 , with the catalog number <unk> @-@ <unk> / 7 . The second disc contain musical tracks from Fusion , along with an additional track arranged by Shinji Hosoe .

 Metroid Fusion was met with critical acclaim , according to Metacritic . The game was considered fun and satisfying by several reviewers . X @-@ Play claimed that it was a " pleasure to play " , and praised its " beautiful " graphics and audio . The game satisfied IGN , which appreciated the lengthy minimum of 10 to 12 hours of playtime required to complete the game , further hailing it as an " outstanding achievement on the Game Boy Advance " . GamesRadar and GamePro , however , felt that the game was " a little short " , but still " love [ d ] every minute of it " , finding the hidden secrets and new power @-@ ups " sublimely ingenious " . The sentiment was shared with GameSpot , which was disappointed that the game ended so soon , but still stated , " Metroid fans should absolutely get it , as should anyone willing to trade off some quantity for some serious quality in their gaming time . " Metroid Fusion received several accolades . It was named Handheld Game of the Year at the 2002 Interactive Achievement Awards . The game was also chosen as Best Game Boy Advance Adventure Game by IGN and Best Action Game on Game Boy Advance by GameSpot . 
 Nintendo World Report and Eurogamer were excited about the game , both calling it the best 2D Metroid game and the best Game Boy Advance game so far . Video game magazine Game Informer agreed , describing the game as " everything you could want from a Game Boy Advance game " from beginning to end , giving it a perfect review score . Play also enjoyed the game , describing it as a " magnified , modified , and improved " version of everything great from Metroid and Super Metroid . 
 Comparing the game to Super Metroid , GameSpot thought that Metroid Fusion offered that game 's best qualities packaged in a new adventure . Nintendo Power heralded it as a return to the classic Metroid action gameplay style . The " perfect " controls were praised by Electronic Gaming Monthly , concluding its review by claiming " all games should feel this good . " The game did not feel new to GameSpy , which complained that even the final enemy encounter draws heavy inspiration from Super Metroid . GameZone found that the small screen was a poor environment in which to play Metroid Fusion , but they ultimately still found it an exciting game . 
 = Shoe polish = 
 Shoe polish ( or boot polish ) , is a waxy paste , cream , or liquid used to polish , shine , and waterproof leather shoes or boots to extend the footwear 's life , and restore , maintain and improve their appearance . 
 Various substances have been used as shoe polish for hundreds of years , starting with natural substances such as wax and tallow . Modern polish formulas were introduced early in the 20th century and many of those original formulations are still in use today . Today , shoe polish is usually made from a mix of natural and synthetic materials , including naphtha , turpentine , dyes , and gum arabic , using straightforward chemical engineering processes . Shoe polish is usually flammable , can be toxic , and , if misused , can stain skin . It should be used in a well @-@ ventilated area with care taken to protect clothes , carpet and furniture . 
 The popularity of shoe polish paralleled a general rise in leather and synthetic shoe production , beginning in the 19th century and continuing into the 20th . The World Wars saw a surge in demand for the product , in order to polish army boots . 
 = = Usage = = 
 Shoe polish is applied to the shoe using a rag , cloth , or brush . Shoe polish is not a cleaning product , and therefore the footwear should be both clean and dry before application . A vigorous rubbing action to apply the polish evenly on the boot , followed by further buffing with a clean dry cloth or brush , usually provides good results . Another technique , known as spit @-@ polishing or bull polishing , involves gently rubbing polish into the leather with a cloth and a drop of water or spit . This achieves the mirror @-@ like , high @-@ gloss finish sometimes known as a spit shine or bull which is especially valued in military organizations . Despite the term , saliva is less commonly used as the vehicle or diluent with polish than is water . <unk> containing <unk> wax can be used as a protective coating to extend the life and look of a leather shoe . 
 Shoe polish may be purchased pre @-@ soaked into a hard sponge , which can be used to buff leather without needing to apply any additional polish to either the leather or the sponge . This is usually known as an applicator . A number of companies that manufacture shoe care products also sell a liquid shoe polish in a <unk> plastic bottle , with a small sponge applicator at the end . To decrease its viscosity , bottled polish usually has a very low wax content . 
 There are many products closely related to shoe polish , but not strictly considered as such . Other chemical products may be used to clean and shine shoes — in particular <unk> for white shoes , and a variety of sprays and aerosols for cleaning and waterproofing suede shoes . A banana peel can also be used to effectively shine shoes , but it is not recommended . 
 Although shoe polish is primarily intended for leather shoes , some brands specify that they may be used on non @-@ porous materials , such as vinyl . The polish is generally the same colour as the shoes it will be used upon , or it may be neutral , lacking any intrinsic colour . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Before the twentieth century = = = 
 Since medieval times , dubbin , a waxy product , was used to soften and waterproof leather ; however , it did not impart shine . It was made from natural wax , oil , soda ash and tallow . As leather with a high natural veneer became popular in the 18th century , a high glossy finish became important , particularly on shoes and boots . In most cases , a variety of homemade polishes were used to provide this finish , often with lanolin or beeswax as a base . 
 In the 19th century many forms of shoe polish became available , yet were rarely referred to as shoe polish or boot polish . Instead , they were often called blacking ( especially when mixed with <unk> ) , or simply continued to be referred to as dubbin . <unk> , an animal by @-@ product , was used to manufacture a simple form of shoe polish at this time . Chicago , Illinois , where 82 % of the processed meat consumed in the United States was processed in the stock yards , became a major shoe polish producing area . 
 In 1832 , James S. Mason of Philadelphia began the commercial production of shoe blacking and inks . In 1851 , James S. Mason & Co. constructed a building at 138 / 140 Front St. where ultimately ten million boxes were produced annually , to hold tins of blacking produced by two hundred employees . Later , tins of blacking were labeled as Mason Shoe Polish . This business ceased operation in 1919 and the building was razed in 1973 . 
 Other early leather preserving products included the Irish brand Punch , which was first made in 1851 . In 1889 , an English man by the name of William Edward Wren , started making shoe polishes and dubbin under the brand name Wren 's . In just 3 years , he won the “ First in the Field – First Award Leather Trades Exhibition 1892 ″ award which was awarded by the Leather Trades Exhibition held in Northampton , the centre of Britain ’ s boot making industry . This signified the importance and prestige of the exhibition in the trade and was a recognition of Wren 's quality . In 1890 the Kroner Brothers established EOS , a shoe polish factory in Berlin , which serviced the Prussian military . It finally closed in 1934 when the Nazis forbade Jews to operate a business . The German brand , Erdal , went on sale in 1901 . 
 Prior to 1906 , shoe polish was not well known as a purchasable product , nor was it particularly sophisticated . While sales were not especially high , a few brands , like Nugget , were available in the U.K. during the 19th century . The practice of shining people ’ s shoes gradually caught on and soon many shoeshine boys in city streets were offering shoe shines using a basic form of shoe polish along with a polishing cloth . 
 = = = Modern polish = = = 
 The first shoe polish to resemble the modern varieties ( aimed primarily at inducing shine ) were the British and British Commonwealth brands like Cherry Blossom , Kiwi and Wren 's . An advertisement published in March 1947 by Wren 's claimed that William Wren originated the first wax polish in 1889 . As the advertisement was endorsed with the Royal Warrant , its claim would be deemed creditable . However , the most well known brand was Kiwi . Scottish expatriates William Ramsay and Hamilton McKellan began making " boot polish " in a small factory in 1904 in Melbourne , Australia . Their formula was a major improvement on previous brands . It preserved shoe leather , made it shine , and restored color . By the time Kiwi Dark Tan was released in 1908 , it incorporated agents that added suppleness and water resistance . Australian @-@ made boot polish was then considered the world 's best . Black and a range of colors became available , and exports to Britain , continental Europe , and New Zealand began , although the polish is now made in the Far East . Previously owned by the Sara Lee Corporation since 1984 , Kiwi was sold in 2011 to SC Johnson [ 1 ] . 
 Ramsay named the shoe polish after the kiwi , the national bird of New Zealand ; Ramsay 's wife , Annie Elizabeth Meek Ramsay , was a native of Oamaru , New Zealand . It has been suggested that , at a time when several symbols were weakly associated with New Zealand , the eventual spread of Kiwi shoe polish around the world enhanced the Kiwi 's popular appeal and promoted it at the expense of the others . 
 A rival brand in the early years was Cobra Boot Polish , based in Sydney . Cobra was noted for a series of cartoon advertisements in The Sydney Bulletin , starting in 1909 , using a character called " Chunder Loo of <unk> Foo . " Chunder is Australian slang for vomit , and possibly originated through the rhyming slang of Chunder Loo and spew ( another slang word for vomit ) . 
 = = = Surge in popularity = = = 
 At the end of the 19th century , leather shoes and boots became affordable to the masses , and with the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , the demand for large numbers of polished army boots led to a need in the market for a product that would allow boots to be polished quickly , efficiently and easily . The polish was also used to shine leather belts , handgun holsters , and horse tack . This demand led to a rapid increase in the sales of shoe and boot polish . The popularity of Kiwi shoe polish spread throughout the British Commonwealth and the United States . Rival brands began to emerge , including <unk> and Cavalier ( United States ) , Cherry Blossom ( United Kingdom ) , <unk> ( India ) , Jean Bart ( France ) , and many others . Advertising became more prominent ; many shoe polish brands used fictional figures or historical characters to spread awareness of their products . In the German documentary of 1927 Berlin : Symphony of a Great City , a scene focuses on shoe shining with a polish called <unk> sporting the face of a Negro . 
 Shoe manufacturing improvements in the mid @-@ 19th century allowed for factories to produce large numbers of shoes made of leather , and later synthetic materials . This increase in leather shoe production continued well into the 20th century and led to a surge in the number of retail shoe stores in the industrialized world , and subsequently a call for shoe polish by footwear consumers . 
 Shoe polish was to be found just about everywhere Allied troops ventured . American war correspondent Walter Graeber wrote for TIME magazine from the Tobruk trenches in 1942 that " old tins of British @-@ made Kiwi polish lay side by side with empty bottles of Chianti . " A story indicative of the rise in global significance of shoe polish is told by Jean ( Gertrude ) Williams , a New Zealander who lived in Japan during the Allied occupation straight after World War II . American soldiers were then finding the dullness of their boots and shoes to be a handicap when trying to win the affections of Japanese women . U.S. military footwear of the time was produced in brown leather with the rough side out . 
 When the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces arrived in Japan — all with boots polished to a degree not known in the U.S. forces — the G.I.s were more conscious than ever of their feet . The secret was found to rest not only in spit and polish , but in the superior Australian boot polish , a commodity which was soon exchanged with the Americans on a fluctuating basis of so many packets of cigarettes for one can of Kiwi boot polish . 
 = = = Modern day = = = 
 Shoe polish products are low @-@ value items that are infrequently purchased , as a single can might last several months for even the most frequent user . Consumer demand is inelastic and largely insensitive to price change , while sales volumes are generally low . In the shoe polish market as a whole , some 26 % of turnover is accounted for by pastes , 24 % by creams , 23 % by aerosols , and 13 % by liquids . In recent years , the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined ; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers for everyday use . 
 There are numerous branded products available , as well as generic store brands . There are two chief areas of shoe polish sales : to the general public , and to specialists and trade , such as shoe repairers , and cobblers . The sales percentages between the two outlets are roughly comparable . 
 Kiwi remains the predominant shoe polish brand in most of the world , being sold in over 180 countries but is often see as a mass market product more known for its cheap prices rather than quality . Today , it is manufactured in Australia , Canada , France , India , Pakistan , South Africa , Spain , the United Kingdom , and the United States . Other leading brands include Kelly 's , <unk> , Lincoln Shoe Polish , <unk> , Angelus , <unk> , Salamander , <unk> and Cherry Blossom . 
 Kiwi was acquired by the American company Sara Lee following its purchase of Reckitt and Colman in 1991 and <unk> with its brand Esquire Shoe Polish in 1987 . The Federal Trade Commission ruled that Sara Lee had to divest its ownership of these companies in 1994 to prevent it from becoming a monopoly . Since this ruling , Sara Lee has been prevented from acquiring any further assets or firms associated with chemical shoe care products in the United States without prior commission approval . The Competition Commission in the United Kingdom investigated the potential monopoly of Sara Lee in the shoe care industry . By the end of 2010 , Sara Lee 's Household & Body Care division ( which included <unk> ) was acquired by <unk> & Son . 
 Empty shoe polish bottles can be used to create graffiti , by dumping out the polish inside and filling it full of ink or paint . They are used as a cheap alternative to markers designed for graffiti , and are much more widely available . Kiwi polish was also used heavily by the U.S. Military . 
 = = Composition and toxicology = = 
 Shoe polish consists of a waxy colloidal emulsion , a substance composed of a number of partially immiscible liquids and solids mixed together . It is usually made from ingredients including some or all of naphtha , lanolin , turpentine , wax ( often <unk> wax ) , gum arabic , ethylene glycol , and if required a colourant , such as carbon black or an <unk> dye ( such as aniline yellow ) . It typically has a specific gravity of 0 @.@ 8 , is negligibly soluble in water , and is made of between 65 and 77 % volatile substances — usually naphtha . The high amount of volatile substances means that the shoe polish will dry out and harden after application , while retaining its shine . 
 <unk> , a hydrophobic grease from wool @-@ bearing animals such as sheep or goats , acts as both a waterproofing wax and a bonding agent , giving the shoe polish its greasy feel and texture . It prevents the naphtha from evaporating until the polish has been spread and buffed into a thin film on the leather surface . An essential ingredient in shoe polish is a thickener ; without this , the polish would be too runny , making it difficult to use . Gum arabic , a substance from two sub @-@ Saharan species of the acacia tree , is commonly used to increase the viscosity of the product . 
 Shoe polish contains chemical substances which can be absorbed through the skin , or inhaled . When handling shoe polish , one should ideally wear gloves , and stay in a well @-@ ventilated area . Shoe polish should be kept out of reach of children and animals . It can stain the skin for a protracted period of time , and will cause irritation to the eye if there is direct contact . 
 = = Manufacture = = 
 Shoe polish can be manufactured using large vats , reasonably powerful heaters and air conditioners . There is no set method of manufacture , although most methods use pressures of two atmospheres to ensure the naphtha does not boil off , and temperatures of up to 85 ° C. 
 The first step in the manufacture of a typical shoe polish is the melting of the wax with the highest melting point in an electric heater . Following this , all other waxes are added , usually by descending order of melting point . While this wax is held at a constant temperature , the emulsion — a mixture of the various oils and , if used , fats , is then heated separately , at around 85 ° C. The heated emulsion is then added to the waxes , along with distilled water . When the mixture reaches around 80 ° C , turpentine oil is added . This mixture is then mixed and continually stirred for half an hour . Dyes are added and mixed in turpentine oil if it is not a neutral polish . The mixed mass is reduced slowly to 50 ° C , and as its viscosity increases , it is poured through a closed funnel into a cooling chamber . The poured mass is allowed to settle slowly , providing uniform distribution . The process is considered straightforward and the required equipment is relatively easy to acquire . The cost of establishing shoe polish manufacturing facilities has been estimated at around $ 600 @,@ 000 ( as of 2005 ) . 
 Shoe polish is traditionally packaged in flat , round , 60 @-@ gram ( 2 @-@ ounce ) tins , usually with an easy @-@ open facility . Because the amount of shoe polish that needs to be applied is small , and the shoe polish will desiccate due to volatile ingredients , such as naphtha , a large container would dry out before being fully used . The traditional flat , round tins have since become synonymous with shoe polishes . 
 = Garret Hobart = 
 Garret Augustus Hobart ( June 3 , 1844 – November 21 , 1899 ) was the 24th Vice President of the United States ( 1897 – 1899 ) , serving under President William McKinley . He was the sixth American vice president to die in office . 
 Hobart was born in Long Branch , New Jersey , on the Jersey Shore , and grew up in nearby Marlboro . After attending Rutgers College , Hobart read law with prominent Paterson attorney Socrates Tuttle . Hobart both studied with Tuttle , and married his daughter . Although he rarely set foot in a courtroom , Hobart became wealthy as a corporate lawyer . 
 Hobart served in local governmental positions , and then successfully ran for office as a Republican , serving in both the New Jersey General Assembly and the New Jersey Senate . He became Speaker of the first , and president of the latter . Hobart was a longtime party official , and New Jersey delegates went to the 1896 Republican National Convention determined to nominate the popular lawyer for vice president . Hobart 's political views were similar to those of McKinley , who was the presumptive Republican presidential candidate . With New Jersey a key state in the upcoming election , McKinley and his close adviser , future senator Mark Hanna , decided to have the convention select Hobart . The vice @-@ presidential candidate emulated his running mate with a front porch campaign , though spending much time at the campaign 's New York City office . McKinley and Hobart were elected . 
 As vice president , Hobart proved a popular figure in Washington and was a close adviser to McKinley . Hobart 's tact and good humor were valuable to the President , as in mid @-@ 1899 when Secretary of War Russell Alger failed to understand that McKinley wanted him to leave office . Hobart invited Alger to his New Jersey summer home , and broke the news to the secretary , who submitted his resignation to McKinley on his return to Washington . Hobart died in November 1899 of heart disease at age 55 ; his place on the Republican ticket in 1900 was taken by Governor Theodore Roosevelt of New York . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Garret Augustus Hobart was born in Long Branch , New Jersey , to Addison Willard Hobart and the former Sophia <unk> . Addison Hobart descended from the early colonial settlers of New England ; many Hobarts served as pastors . Addison Hobart came to New Jersey to teach at a school in Marlboro NJ . His mother was descended from 17th @-@ century Dutch settlers in New Amsterdam ( today New York City ) who had moved to Long Island and then to New Jersey . When Addison and Sophia Hobart married in 1841 , they moved to Long Branch , where Addison founded an elementary school . Garret was born in Long Branch on June 3 , 1844 . Three children survived infancy ; Garret was the second of three boys . 
 Garret initially attended his father 's school in Long Branch . The Hobart family moved to Marlboro in the early 1850s ; Garret was sent to the village school . Childhood tales of the future vice president describe him as an excellent student in both day and Sunday School , and a leader in boyhood sports . Recognizing Garret 's abilities , his father sent him to a well @-@ regarded school in Freehold , but after a disagreement with the teacher , the boy refused to return ; he was sent to a school in Matawan , boarding there during the week . He graduated from that school in 1859 at age 15 , but being thought by his parents too young to go to college , remained home for a year studying and working part @-@ time . Garret Hobart then enrolled in Rutgers College , from which he graduated in 1863 at age 19 , finishing third in his class . He received his diploma from Theodore Frelinghuysen , New Jersey 's first major @-@ party vice @-@ presidential candidate , who had run unsuccessfully with Henry Clay in 1844 . In later life , Hobart was a generous donor to Rutgers , received an honorary degree after becoming vice president , and shortly before his death was elected a trustee . 
 = = Lawyer and part @-@ time politician = = 
 After graduation from Rutgers , Hobart worked briefly as a teacher to repay loans . Although Hobart was young and in good health , he did not serve in the Union Army . Addison Hobart 's childhood friend , lawyer Socrates Tuttle , offered to take Garret into his office to read law . Tuttle was a prominent Passaic County lawyer who had served in the legislature . Hobart supported himself during his time of study in Paterson by working as a bank clerk ; he later became director of the same bank . Hobart was admitted to the bar as an attorney in 1866 ; he became a counsellor @-@ at @-@ law in 1871 and was made a master in chancery in 1872 . 
 In addition to learning law from Tuttle , Hobart fell in love with his daughter . Jennie Tuttle Hobart remembered , " When this attractive young law student appeared in our home I , then a young girl in my teens , unexpectedly played a rôle of importance by losing my heart to him " . The two were married on July 21 , 1869 . The Hobarts had long been Democrats ; Garret Hobart 's marriage into the Republican Tuttle family converted him to that party . The couple had four children , two of whom survived infancy . One daughter , Fannie , died in 1895 ; Hobart 's son , Garret Jr. survived him . 
 Socrates Tuttle was influential in Paterson , which worked to Hobart 's advantage . According to Michael J. Connolly in his 2010 article about Hobart , the future vice president " benefitted greatly from Tuttle 's beneficence " . In 1866 , the year he became a lawyer , Hobart was appointed grand jury clerk for Passaic County . When Tuttle became mayor of Paterson in 1871 , he made Hobart city counsel . A year later , Hobart became counsel for the county Board of Chosen Freeholders . 
 In 1872 , Hobart ran as a Republican for the New Jersey General Assembly from Passaic County 's third legislative district . He was easily elected , taking nearly two @-@ thirds of the vote . The General Assembly was then elected annually and he was successful in winning re @-@ election the following year , although his margin of victory was cut in half . In 1874 , still only age 30 , he was voted Speaker of the Assembly . At the time , it was customary to step down after two terms , and he did so , although Hobart biographer David Magie maintained that he was urged to seek re @-@ election . Instead , he campaigned for the Republican nominee for his seat , who was elected . In 1876 , Hobart was nominated for the New Jersey Senate seat for Passaic County . He was elected to a three @-@ year term , and was re @-@ elected in 1879 . In 1881 and 1882 , he served as President of the state Senate , becoming the first man to lead both houses of the legislature . In 1883 , he was the Republican nominee in the election for United States Senate — until 1913 , senators were elected by state legislatures . As the Democrats had more legislators , a Republican had no chance of election — the nomination was simply a way of honoring Hobart for his political service . When he was asked his feelings about the nomination , he responded , " I do not worry about things that do not come my way . " The " complimentary " nomination would prove to be Hobart 's only electoral defeat . 
 Hobart said of his involvement in public affairs , " I make politics my recreation . " He devoted most of his time to a law practice which according to Hobart 's legislative biography was highly profitable . He was rarely seen in a courtroom ; his official biography for the 1896 campaign admitted that " he has actually appeared in court a smaller number of times than , perhaps , any lawyer in Passaic County " . Hobart 's real work was in advising corporations how to accomplish their aims , yet remain within the law . He also had a lucrative business acting as court @-@ appointed receiver of bankrupt railroads . Hobart reorganized them , and restored them to fiscal health . He often invested heavily in them ; his success made him wealthy . In addition to the railroads for which he acted as receiver , he served as president of the Paterson Railway Company , which ran the city 's streetcars , and as a board member for other railroads . 
 One reason for Hobart 's success in both the private and public sectors was his genial personality . He worked well with others , and was noted for tact and charm . Senator Mark Hatfield , in his book on American vice presidents , suggests that these qualities would have made Hobart successful in Washington had he run for Congress . Hatfield states that the reason why Hobart chose not to move from state to national politics before 1896 was a reluctance to leave a comfortable life and successful law practice in Paterson . Instead , Hobart continued to involve himself in party politics ; he was widely regarded as Northern New Jersey 's most influential Republican . Beginning in 1876 , he was a delegate to every Republican National Convention in his lifetime . He was a member of the New Jersey Republican Committee from 1880 to 1891 , resigning the position as he became more deeply involved in Republican National Committee affairs — he was New Jersey 's representative on the committee after 1884 , rising to become vice chairman .

 Jennie Hobart , in her memoirs , traced her suspicions that her husband might be a vice @-@ presidential contender to a lunch she had with him at the Waldorf Hotel in New York in March 1895 . During the meal , industrialist and future senator Mark Hanna interrupted them to ask what Garret Hobart thought of the possible presidential candidacy of Ohio Governor William McKinley — Hanna was one of McKinley 's principal backers . Garret Hobart evaded the question , but Jennie Hobart believed the conversation to have been the first of a chain of events which elevated her husband to national office . 
 In November 1895 , Republican John Griggs was elected governor of New Jersey ; his campaign was managed by Hobart . The election of New Jersey 's first Republican governor since the 1860s led to speculation in the newspapers that Hobart would be a candidate for vice president . New Jersey Republicans were anxious to nominate Hobart , both to see one of their own possibly elevated to national office , and in the hope that having Hobart on the national ticket would boost the Republican vote in New Jersey . Hobart was an attractive candidate as he was from a swing state , and the Griggs victory showed that Republicans could hope to win New Jersey 's electoral votes , which they had not done since 1872 . Another reason for a Hobart selection was his wealth ; he could be expected to spend abundantly on his own campaign . 
 According to Hanna biographer Herbert Croly , Hobart , an early supporter of McKinley , helped ensure New Jersey 's support for him at the Republican convention . Historian Stanley Jones , in his study of the 1896 election , stated that Hobart stopped off in Canton , Ohio , McKinley 's hometown , en route to the convention in St. Louis . Jones wrote that the future vice president was selected several days in advance , after Speaker of the House Thomas Reed of Maine turned down the nomination . Croly asserted that McKinley and Hanna desired an <unk> on the ticket to balance it and boost support in the Mid @-@ Atlantic region . The conventional means of assuring this was to nominate a politician from New York , then the largest state in population . As many New York delegates supported their favorite son candidate , Governor ( and former vice president ) Levi P. Morton , instead of McKinley , giving the state the vice @-@ presidential nomination would be an unmerited reward . According to Croly , 
 On the other hand , the adjoining state of New Jersey submitted an eligible candidate in Mr. Garret A. Hobart , who had done much to strengthen the Republican party in his own neighborhood . Mr. Hobart was well known to Mr. Hanna , and in all probability his nomination had been scheduled for some time . It was practically announced early in June . He was a lawyer and a business man with an exclusively local reputation ; and if he did little to strengthen the ticket he did nothing to weaken it . 
 McKinley was nominated for president on the first ballot . Hobart described his subsequent first @-@ ballot nomination for vice president as a tribute from his friends , but Hatfield noted , " it came equally as a tribute from [ Hanna , who ] wanted a ticket to satisfy the business interests of America , and Hobart , a corporate lawyer , fit that requirement perfectly " . Although a Hobart nomination had been talked about at least since Griggs ' victory the previous November , Hobart expressed reluctance in a letter to his wife from the convention : " It looks to me I will be nominated for Vice @-@ President whether I want it or not , and as I get nearer to the point where I may , I am dismayed at the thought ... If I want a nomination , everything is going my way . But when I realize all that it means in work , worry , and loss of home and bliss , I am overcome , so overcome I am simply miserable . " Despite Hobart 's expressed hesitation , he was welcomed home by a crowd of 15 @,@ 000 at the Paterson Armory . City officials , feeling they had insufficient fireworks to properly honor Hobart , obtained more from New York City . 
 According to historian R. Hal Williams , the Republicans left St. Louis in June with " a popular , experienced [ presidential ] candidate , a respected vice @-@ presidential nominee , and an attractive platform " . Many Republicans were convinced the election would be fought over the issue of tariffs , and they anticipated an easy victory . On June 30 , 1896 , Hobart journeyed by train to Canton , where he was met at the station by his running mate . McKinley drove Hobart to the Ohioan 's home , where Hobart followed McKinley in speaking to a delegation which had arrived to greet the presidential candidate . Hobart only remained in Canton a few hours before returning east . According to Magie , Hobart made the trip " to pay his respects to the head of the ticket and to consult with him upon important matters " . McKinley biographer Margaret Leech recorded that the two men were friends almost as soon as they met .

 The Panic of 1893 had led to hard times in the United States , and the effects were still felt in 1896 . One proposal to cure the economic malaise was " Free Silver " ; that the government would accept silver bullion and return it to the depositor , struck into silver dollars . At the time , the silver in a dollar coin was worth $ <unk> . Implementation of the proposals would increase the money supply and cause difficulties in international trade with nations that remained on the gold standard . Proponents argued that the increased money supply would stimulate the economy . President Grover Cleveland was firmly for the gold standard , a stance which bitterly divided the Democratic Party . Most Republicans were for the gold standard , though some , mostly from the West , were " Silver Republicans " . The Democrats in early July nominated for president an eloquent silver supporter , former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan , whose Cross of Gold speech at the convention catapulted him to the nomination . The selection of Bryan prompted a wave of popular support for the Democrats . 
 Hobart was a strong supporter of the gold standard ; and insisted on it remaining a major part of the Republican campaign even in the face of Bryan 's surge . In his speech responding to the formal notification of his convention victory , Hobart stated , " An honest dollar , worth 100 cents everywhere , cannot be coined out of 53 cents worth of silver plus a legislative fiat . Such a debasement of our currency would inevitably produce incalculable loss , appalling disaster , and National dishonor . " McKinley was not as strong a supporter of the gold standard as Hobart , and considered modifying some of Hobart 's expressed views on the gold standard before the acceptance was printed for public distribution . Hobart insisted on it being printed without change , writing , " I think I know the sentiment of Eastern men better than you can , and with this knowledge and my convictions I must retain the statements as I have written them . " According to Connolly , " Though a protectionist , Hobart believed the money issue , not tariffs , led to a November Republican victory , and , in denouncing silver , his rhetoric far outstripped [ that of ] William McKinley . " 
 Together with Pennsylvania Senator Matthew Quay , Hobart ran the McKinley campaign 's New York office , often making the short journey from Paterson for strategy meetings . The vice @-@ presidential candidate emulated McKinley in giving speeches from his front porch ; unlike McKinley he also addressed rallies . In October , he made a short tour of New Jersey to campaign , expressing relief to his wife when it came to a close . On November 3 , 1896 , the voters cast their ballots in most states ; a nervous Hobart spent the day at his office . Special telegraph wires had been attached to his home ; at 8 : 30 in the evening they conveyed the news to him that McKinley and Hobart had won . The Republican ticket won New Jersey , together with the entire Northeast . The following week , Vice President @-@ elect Hobart attended Rutgers ' 130th anniversary celebrations as guest of honor . The member of the Class of 1863 was now Rutgers ' most prominent graduate .

 Hobart spent much of the four months between election and inauguration reading about the vice presidency , preparing for the move , and winding down some business affairs . He did not , however , resign from the boards of corporations which would not have business before the federal government . " It would be highly ridiculous for me to resign from the different companies in which I am officer and a stockholder whose interests are not in the least affected , or likely to be , by my position as Vice President . " On March 2 , 1897 the Hobarts left Paterson to travel to Washington by special train . On March 4 , Garret Hobart was inaugurated as vice president in the Senate Chamber . The Chicago Daily News predicted , " Garret A. Hobart will not be seen or heard until , after four years , he emerges from the impenetrable vacuum of the Vice Presidency . "

 Upon moving to Washington , the Hobarts established themselves at the Arlington Hotel , which was the Washington home to many political men of the era , including Hanna . Soon , however , Pennsylvania Senator Don Cameron offered them the lease of the house he owned at 21 Madison Place , diagonally across Pennsylvania Avenue from the Executive Mansion ( as the White House was still formally known ) . The asking price was $ 10 @,@ 000 per year ; the Vice President bargained Cameron down to $ 8 @,@ 000 ( equal to the vice presidential salary ) by suggesting that the public might assume he stole the excess . Among the frequent visitors at what came to be known as the " Cream White House " was Hanna , by then a senator , who would come by for breakfast and talk with the Vice President until it was time for both to go to the Senate . 
 The President and Vice President were already friends from the campaign ; after the inauguration , a close relationship grew between the two men , and their wives . The First Lady , Ida McKinley , had health issues , and could not stand the strain of the required official entertaining . Jennie Hobart often substituted for the First Lady at receptions and other events , and also was a close companion , visiting her daily . The Hobarts and McKinleys visited each other 's home without formality ; according to Jennie Hobart , writing in 1930 , " it was an intimate friendliness that no Vice President and his wife , before or since , have had the privilege of sharing with their chief administrator . " The Hobarts often entertained at their house , which was useful to McKinley , who could attend and meet informally with congressmen without placing strain on his wife with a White House function . McKinley , who had become insolvent while governor of Ohio , turned over a portion of his presidential salary to Hobart to invest . 
 The vice president had in recent administrations been considered a relatively low @-@ level political functionary , whose activities were generally limited to the constitutional function of presiding over the Senate . Hobart , however , became a close adviser to McKinley and his Cabinet members , although he was not called upon to attend Cabinet meetings . Reporter Arthur Wallace Dunn wrote of Hobart in 1922 , " for the first time in my recollection , and the last for that matter , the Vice President was recognized as somebody , as a part of the Administration , and as a part of the body over which he presided " . 
 Through late 1897 and early 1898 , many Americans called for the United States to intervene in Cuba , then a Spanish colony revolting against the mother country . These calls greatly increased in February 1898 , when the American battleship Maine sank in Havana harbor after an explosion . McKinley sought delay , hoping to settle the disputes peacefully , but in April 1898 , Hobart told the President that the Senate would act against Spain whether McKinley liked it or not . McKinley gave in ; Congress declared war on April 25 , beginning the Spanish – American War , and Hobart sent McKinley a pen with which to sign the declaration . 
 = = = " Assistant President " = = = 
 Hobart was more assertive as Senate president than his predecessors had been . It was customary for the vice president not to rule on disputed points , but to submit them to a vote . Hobart , with his experience as a presiding officer in the New Jersey Legislature , took a more assertive role , ruling on disputes , and trying to expedite legislation . Hobart was initially diffident in his role , feeling himself unproven beside longtime national legislators , but soon gained self @-@ confidence , writing in a letter that " I find that I am as good and as capable as any of them . If they know a whole lot of things I don 't know , I also know a whole lot of things they don 't know . And there is a common humanity running through them all that makes us all as one , after all . " Hobart was so successful at guiding the administration 's legislative agenda through the Senate that he became known as the " assistant President " . 
 Hobart was constant in his attendance at the Senate ; one onlooker called him a " chronic audience " . Vice President Hobart only cast his tie @-@ breaking vote once , using it to defeat an amendment which would have promised self @-@ government to the Philippines , one of the possessions which the United States had taken from Spain after the war . Hobart was instrumental in securing the ratification of the Treaty of Paris , which ended the war ; according to McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan , Hobart was " almost the president 's alter ego , [ turning ] every screw with his legendary politeness " . 
 One post which Hobart refused to relinquish upon his inauguration was his position as one of three Joint Traffic Association ( JTA ) arbiters . The association was a group of railroads which sought to coordinate rates ; if two railroads applied rates in different ways , the matter was settled by Hobart and two other arbiters . Hobart heard appeals while vice president . An October 1897 Supreme Court decision signaled that the JTA was likely to be found in violation of the Sherman Anti @-@ Trust Act ( it was , the following year ) and Hobart resigned as arbiter in November 1897 . Hobart was a major investor in the Ramapo Water Company ; he had interests in many New York and New Jersey water utilities . In mid @-@ 1899 , there was controversy over the so @-@ called " Ramapo Scheme " , whereby the Ramapo Water Company , which owned large tracts of land in the Catskill Mountains , would sell New York City $ 5 million in water per year for 40 years at high rates . The proposal was never agreed to , and a Republican @-@ controlled investigating committee found no wrongdoing , but Hobart 's role in the company was widely discussed in the press . 
 = = = Illness and death = = = 
 By late 1898 , Hobart had fallen ill with a serious heart ailment , which he at first concealed from the public . He continued Senate duty , but nearly collapsed after delivering an address closing the session . He accompanied the President on a vacation trip to Hanna 's winter home in Thomasville , Georgia , but quickly contracted the flu and returned to Washington . By April 1899 , Hobart 's illness was well known in the press , though Hanna assured the newspapers that Hobart would be on the ticket in 1900 : " nothing but death or an earthquake can stop the re @-@ nomination of Vice President Hobart " . Hobart rented a home in his birthplace of Long Branch , then an upscale Jersey Shore resort . Doctors prescribed complete rest , and the Vice President amused himself by feeding two pet fish , a gold one named McKinley and a silver one named Bryan . 
 Despite his vice president 's ill health , McKinley called upon him to break the news to Secretary of War Russell Alger that McKinley wanted him to resign — the secretary had ignored or misunderstood repeated hints from the President . According to McKinley biographer Margaret Leech , " The President did not show his usual hypersensitive regard for other people 's feelings in handing over to a sick man a disagreeable task which it was his own duty to perform . " Hobart invited Alger to Long Branch for the weekend , and broke the news ; Alger duly submitted his resignation to McKinley . Hobart 's condition worsened within days of the Alger visit , and he was soon bedridden . The New York Sun attributed Alger 's resignation to Hobart 's " crystal insight " and " velvet tact " ; after which Hobart wrote to McKinley , " My ' crystal insight ' is still clear , but the nap is slightly worn off my velvet tact " . 
 After a vacation with the McKinleys on Lake Champlain , Hobart returned to Paterson in September . On November 1 , 1899 , the government announced that Hobart would not return to public life . His condition deteriorated rapidly , and he died on November 21 , 1899 at age 55 . President McKinley told the family , " No one outside of this home feels this loss more deeply than I do . " 
 New Jersey Governor Foster Voorhees ordered that state buildings be draped in mourning for 30 days , and that flags be flown at half staff until Hobart 's funeral . Hobart 's home , Carroll Hall , was opened to the public for four hours so that citizens might pass by his open casket ; 12 @,@ 000 people did so . Hobart was laid to rest at Cedar Lawn Cemetery in Paterson after a large public funeral , attended by President McKinley and many high government officials . Although the large government delegation meant that few local people could attend the service , a crowd of 50 @,@ 000 came to Paterson to honor Hobart . 
 The mausoleum over the grave was erected in 1901 . His wife purchased eleven plots adjoining the family plot to accommodate the structure . The building has massive marble columns in the front with a heavy metal door ; on the back above the sarcophagus is a stained glass window . There are two sarcophagi in the center of the building , for Garret Hobart and his wife . Around the tomb are niches for other members of the family . At the time of construction in 1901 , the mausoleum cost about $ 80 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Hobart significantly expanded the powers of the vice presidency , becoming a presidential adviser , and taking a leadership role as president of the Senate . Between his advisory and leadership roles , Hobart was perhaps the most influential vice president since Martin Van Buren . Although Magie , writing in 1910 , stated that Hobart 's death " fixed his memory at the height of his fame " , the former vice president is today little remembered . According to Hatfield , he is best known for his death , clearing the way for the ascent of New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt , who took Hobart 's place on the Republican ticket in 1900 and succeeded as president after McKinley 's assassination in 1901 . 
 His nephew , George S. Hobart , served as Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly . 
 A statue of Hobart , erected in 1903 , stands outside Paterson 's city hall . The communities of Hobart , Oklahoma , and Hobart , Washington , are named after the former vice president . Connolly finds Hobart to be very much a man of his times : 
 The public increasingly identified Republicans with the union of big business , big money , and big government , a union that ignited a Progressive reaction after 1900 . Vice President Garret A. Hobart directed that union as lawyer , business receiver and director , and New Jersey Republican . He represented everything Progressives hated : a railroad advocate when railroads became America 's most mistrusted industry , a corporate attorney who facilitated the agglomeration of capital when the public revolted against monopolies and trusts , a financial operator who used his political insight to capture lucrative business opportunities , and a national leader who moved easily between the worlds of political pull and economic power . As much as Hanna or any Gilded Age business @-@ politician , Hobart symbolized the era .

 " Weird Al " Yankovic in 3 @-@ D ( often referred to simply as In 3 @-@ D ) is the second studio album by American singer @-@ songwriter " Weird Al " Yankovic , released on February 28 , 1984 , by Rock ' n Roll Records . The album was one of many produced by former The McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer . Recorded between October and December 1983 , the album was Yankovic 's follow @-@ up to his modestly successful debut LP , " Weird Al " Yankovic . 
 The music on " ' Weird Al ' Yankovic in 3 @-@ D " is built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid @-@ 1980s . Half of the album is made up of parodies , featuring jabs at Michael Jackson , Men Without Hats , The Greg Kihn Band , The Police , and Survivor . The other half of the album is original material , featuring many " style parodies " , or musical imitations that come close to , but do not copy , existing artists . These style parodies include imitations of specific artists like Bob Marley and The B @-@ 52s . This album marked a musical departure from Yankovic 's self @-@ titled debut , in that the arrangements of the parodies were now closer to the originals and the accordion was no longer used in every song , now only being featured where deemed appropriate or wholly inappropriate for comedic effect . " Weird Al " Yankovic in 3 @-@ D is also notable for being the first album released by Yankovic to feature a polka medley of hit songs . These pastiches of hit songs , set to polka music , have since appeared on nearly all of Yankovic 's albums . 
 " Weird Al " Yankovic in 3 @-@ D was met with mostly positive reviews and peaked at number seventeen on the Billboard 200 and number sixty @-@ one in Australia . The album also produced one of Yankovic 's most famous singles , " Eat It " ( a parody of Michael Jackson 's " Beat It " ) , which peaked at number twelve on the Billboard Hot 100 . This song was Yankovic 's highest charting single until " White & Nerdy " from his 2006 album Straight Outta Lynwood peaked at number nine in the October 21 , 2006 Billboard charts . " Eat It " also charted at number one in Australia , making it Yankovic 's only number one single in any country . The album also produced two minor US hits , " King of Suede " , which peaked at number sixty @-@ two , and " I Lost on Jeopardy " , which peaked at number eighty @-@ one . The album was Yankovic 's first Gold record , and went on to be certified Platinum for sales of over one million copies in the United States . " Eat It " won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Performance Single or Album , Spoken or Musical in 1985 .

 In October 1983 , Yankovic began recording his second album at Santa Monica Sound Recorders , in Santa Monica , California . To produce it , he brought in former The McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer , who also produced Yankovic 's first album . Backing Yankovic were Jon " Bermuda " Schwartz on drums , Steve Jay on bass , and Jim West on guitar . During the first recording session for the album , five original songs were recorded : " Nature Trail To Hell " , " Mr. Popeil " , " Buy Me a Condo " , " Midnight Star " , and " That Boy Could Dance " . Two months later , Yankovic began recording the five parodies and polka medley that would appear on the album : " Eat It " , " King of Suede " , " I Lost on Jeopardy " , " Theme from Rocky XIII ( The Rye or the Kaiser ) " , " The Brady Bunch " , and " Polkas on 45 " . 
 Every song on Yankovic 's debut album was played on an accordion , accompanied by bass , guitar , and drums . On In 3 @-@ D Yankovic decided to restrict the accordion to certain sections , most notably the polka medley " Polkas on 45 " . In the " Ask Al " section on his web site , Yankovic explained : " Nowadays , I only use it on original songs where I feel an accordion is appropriate , and on parody songs where I feel an accordion is extremely inappropriate ( for comic effect ) ... and of course , on the polka medleys . I 'm not really downplaying the accordion at all - I usually feature the accordion on three or four songs every album , which is three or four more accordion @-@ based songs than most Top 40 albums have ! " 
 " It 's kind of a backlash from the first album , where we had accordion on everything . It just became a little overwhelming to me . For a while I was relegating the accordion to just the polka medleys . I 'm probably going to be using a bit more accordion in the future ; I get letters from people saying they miss the accordion on the records . " 
 = = = Originals = = = 
 One of the first originals recorded for the album was " Midnight Star " , a loving ode to fictional supermarket tabloids . The liner notes to Permanent Record state that a Weekly World News article about the " Incredible Frog Boy " helped to inspire the song . According to Yankovic , most of the tabloid headlines were real . He spent several weeks collecting and looking through old tabloids to find inane titles . Initially he thought that " Midnight Star " should have been the lead single for the album , but later relented and released " Eat It " instead . " Buy Me a Condo " is a style parody of Bob Marley and the reggae genre in general . 
 " Mr. Popeil " is a song discussing the inventor Samuel Popeil and his myriad inventions of varying usefulness . Musically , it is a style parody of the B @-@ 52s , something that Robert Christgau once said " exploits Yankovic 's otherwise fatal resemblance to Fred Schneider . " One of the backing vocalists on the track is Samuel Popeil 's daughter Lisa Popeil . When recording the song , Yankovic came across an article about Lisa Popeil and her singing career ; later he asked her if she would be interested in appearing in the song , to which she agreed . 
 The last original song to be recorded for the album was " Nature Trail to Hell " , about a fictional slasher film " in 3 @-@ D " . At the 3 : 40 mark , the song has a backward message that says " Satan eats Cheez Whiz ! " This , in turn , was a parody of the Satanic backmasking scare during the early 1980s . Online magazine Pitchfork Media has alluded to the song several times , once comparing it to " Thrill Kill " by The Damned , and another time sarcastically calling the song a " classic " . It ends on a single extended chord played on multiple pianos , akin to the Beatles ' " A Day in the Life " .

 The first parody recorded for the album was " The Brady Bunch " , in which the narrator expresses his dislike of the sitcom The Brady Bunch . The song also contains a lyrical adaptation of the " Brady Bunch Theme Song " , something that Yankovic would later do in his " Money for Nothing / Beverly Hillbillies " parody from UHF ( 1989 ) . 
 On the same day that " The Brady Bunch " was recorded , Yankovic started working on " I Lost on Jeopardy " , a parody of " Jeopardy " by The Greg Kihn Band . The song describes a situation in which the narrator loses spectacularly on the game show Jeopardy ! . Show announcer Don Pardo lends his voice to a segment of the song . In order to create the parody , Yankovic cleared the idea not only with Greg Kihn , but also with Merv Griffin , who created the show . Don Pardo , Art Fleming , and Kihn all appeared in the music video . Kihn , the composer of the original song , was extremely pleased and flattered by the parody . In 2009 , Kihn wrote a blog on his MySpace called " Weird Al and Mailbox Money " , in which he complimented Yankovic 's comedy and explained the mechanics of how a parody works . Kihn referred to the royalty checks he still receives from " I Lost on Jeopardy " as " Mailbox Money " . 
 The next parodies to be recorded were " Theme from Rocky XIII ( The Rye or the Kaiser ) " , a parody of Survivor 's " Eye of the Tiger " about a washed @-@ up Rocky Balboa , who now runs a deli and occasionally beats up on the <unk> ; and " King of Suede " , a parody of The Police 's " King of Pain " , about a clothing store owner who claims the titular title . In order to research information for the latter , Yankovic would walk around in fabric stores taking notes . He later remarked , " I got a lot of nasty stares from store managers . " 
 The final parody recorded for the album was " Eat It " , a parody of Michael Jackson 's " Beat It " , about an exasperated parent 's quest to get their picky child to eat right . Yankovic formulated the idea during a brainstorming session between himself , Robert K. Weiss , and his manager Jay Levey . They were bouncing ideas off one another until suddenly " [ they ] had the whole thing written . " Although he knew that the best way to get permission to parody a song was through the official songwriter , Yankovic was unsure what type of reaction he would get from Jackson when presented with the parody lyrics . However , Jackson allegedly thought it was a " funny idea " , and allowed the parody . In the mockumentary The Compleat Al , there is a scene portraying the fictitious meeting of Yankovic and Jackson . Musically , the parody is slightly different from the original , featuring a changed key , comic sound effects , and an Eddie Van Halen @-@ inspired guitar solo from Yankovic 's producer Rick Derringer . 
 " Eat It " was Yankovic 's first — and , until " Smells Like Nirvana " ( 1992 ) , his only — Top Forty hit , peaking at number twelve on the Billboard Hot 100 . It was also Yankovic 's highest @-@ charting single until " White & Nerdy " reached number nine on the October 21 , 2006 , Billboard chart . " Eat It " was a worldwide hit , even managing to peak at number one in Australia . For many years , Yankovic became known colloquially as " The ' Eat It ' guy . " He refers to this sarcastically on his own personal Twitter ; underneath the description is written " You know ... the Eat It guy . " 
 One of the last songs recorded for the album was " Polkas on 45 " . The song , whose title is a take on the novelty act Stars on 45 , is a medley of popular rock songs from the 1960s and 1970s . " Polkas on 45 " evolved from an early polka medley that Yankovic had played when opening for new wave band Missing Persons in 1981 . This early version included parts of various new wave songs , including " Jocko Homo " by Devo , " Homosapien " by Pete Shelley , " Sex Junkie " by <unk> , " <unk> " by The Normal , " Bad Boys Get <unk> " by The Pretenders , " TV Party " by Black Flag , " Janitor " by Suburban Lawns , and " People Who Died " by Jim Carroll . After being asked how he picked the songs to include , Yankovic responded , " I just pick songs that sound slightly better done polka style — the way God intended . "

 Critical response to In 3 @-@ D was generally positive . The album received a score of four and a half stars from Allmusic , with Eugene Chadbourne saying , " With an album behind him , Weird Al Yankovic makes much of the improvements expected of new artists when they get a second crack at a release a year later . " Christopher Thelen from The Daily Vault wrote that " All in all , this disc held out the promise that Yankovic was destined for greatness ... " In addition , " Weird Al " Yankovic in 3 @-@ D was also named one of the Year 's Top 10 Albums in 1984 by People magazine . Den of Geek even named In 3 @-@ D as one of the " 10 Reasons Why 1984 Was a Great Year for Geek Movies " — despite it not being a movie . On November 1 , 2011 , Spin magazine named In 3 @-@ D as the seventeenth greatest comedy album of all time . 
 Not all reviews were positive , however . Robert Christgau gave the album a C + rating , calling it " Mad for the ears . " Some critics were split on how Yankovic composed , performed , and recorded his parodies , compared to his 1983 debut album . The Daily Vault commented thus : 
 Parody @-@ wise , Yankovic still always managed to throw a different loop into the music to make it sound different than the song it was based on . ( I happen to like the fact that Yankovic now writes parodies to sound exactly like the original song . ) As a result , " Theme From Rocky XIII " doesn 't have the crispness as the original song from Survivor did , " The Brady Bunch " is sped up ( in both tempo and pitch ) from Men Without Hats 's " The Safety Dance " , and " Eat It " takes Michael Jackson 's " Beat It " and raises the pitch . 
 Many of the songs and singles from In 3 @-@ D would later appear on greatest hits albums . " Eat It " and " I Lost on Jeopardy " appeared both on Yankovic 's first greatest hits album ( 1988 ) and on the The Essential " Weird Al " Yankovic ( 2009 ) ; the latter also featured " Polkas on 45 " . Seven of the album 's songs — " Polkas on 45 " , " Midnight Star " , " Eat It " , " Mr. Popeil " , " I Lost on Jeopardy " , " Buy Me a Condo " , and " King of Suede " — were featured in Yankovic 's box set Permanent Record : Al in the Box . 
 At the 27th Grammy Awards in 1985 , " Weird Al " Yankovic won his first Grammy Award , the Best Comedy Performance Single or Album , Spoken or Musical , for his hit single " Eat It " .

 " Weird Al " Yankovic in 3 @-@ D was released on February 28 , 1984 . On April 28 , it peaked at number 17 , where it remained for three consecutive weeks . In 3 @-@ D spent a total of twenty @-@ three weeks on the chart . It was also successful in Australia , where it peaked at number 61 on the album chart . Many of the album 's singles also went on to be successful . " Eat It " eventually sold over a half a million copies , peaked at number twelve domestically on the Billboard Hot 100 , and was certified Gold . It was also a world @-@ wide hit , peaking at number thirty @-@ six in the United Kingdom and number one in Australia . As of March 2012 , " Eat It " is currently Yankovic 's only number one single in any country .

 = Common house martin = 
 The common house martin ( Delichon urbicum ) , sometimes called the northern house martin or , particularly in Europe , just house martin , is a migratory passerine bird of the swallow family which breeds in Europe , north Africa and temperate Asia ; and winters in sub @-@ Saharan Africa and tropical Asia . It feeds on insects which are caught in flight , and it migrates to climates where flying insects are plentiful . It has a blue head and upperparts , white rump and pure white underparts , and is found in both open country and near human habitation . It is similar in appearance to the two other martin species of the genus Delichon , which are both endemic to eastern and southern Asia . It has two accepted subspecies . 
 Both the scientific and colloquial name of the bird are related to its use of human @-@ made structures . It builds a closed cup nest from mud pellets under eaves or similar locations on buildings usually in colonies . 
 It is hunted by the Eurasian hobby ( Falco subbuteo ) , and like other birds is affected by internal parasites and external fleas and mites , although its large range and population mean that it is not threatened globally . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The common house martin was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Hirundo urbica , but was placed in its current genus , Delichon , by Thomas Horsfield and Frederic Moore in 1854 . Delichon is an anagram of the Ancient Greek term χελιδών ( chelīdōn ) , meaning " swallow " , and the species name urbicum ( urbica until 2004 , due to a misunderstanding of Latin grammar ) means " of the town " in Latin . 
 The genus Delichon is a recent divergence from the barn swallow genus Hirundo , and its three members are similar in appearance with blue upperparts , a contrasting white @-@ rump , and whitish underparts . In the past , the common house martin was sometimes considered to be conspecific with the Asian house martin ( D. dasypus ) , which breeds in the mountains of central and eastern Asia and winters in Southeast Asia , and it also closely resembles the Nepal house martin ( D. nipalense ) , a resident in the mountains of southern Asia . Although the three Delichon martins are similar in appearance , only D. urbicum has a pure white rump and underparts . 
 The common house martin has two geographical subspecies , the western nominate subspecies D. u. urbicum , and the eastern D. u. lagopodum , which was described by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1811 . Other races , like meridionalis from around the Mediterranean have been described , but the claimed differences from the nominate race are clinal , and therefore probably invalid . 
 = = Description = = 
 The adult common house martin of the western nominate race is 13 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) long , with a wing span of 26 – 29 centimetres ( 10 @.@ 2 – 11 @.@ 4 in ) and a weight averaging 18 @.@ 3 grammes ( 0 @.@ 65 oz ) . It is steel @-@ blue above with a white rump , and white underparts , including the underwings ; even its short legs have white downy feathering . It has brown eyes and a small black bill , and its toes and exposed parts of the legs are pink . The sexes are similar , but the juvenile bird is sooty black , and some of its wing coverts and quills have white tips and edgings . D. u. lagopodum differs from the nominate race in that its white rump extends much further onto the tail , and the fork of its tail is intermediate in depth between that of D. u. urbicum and that of the Asian house martin . 
 The white rump and underparts of the common house martin , very noticeable in flight , prevent confusion with other widespread <unk> swallows such as the barn swallow ( Hirundo rustica ) , sand martin ( Riparia riparia ) or red @-@ rumped swallow ( Cecropis <unk> ) . In Africa , confusion with grey @-@ rumped swallow ( <unk> <unk> ) is possible , but that species has a grey rump , off @-@ white underparts and long , deeply forked tail . The common house martin flies with a wing beat averaging 5 @.@ 3 beats per second , which is faster than the wing beat of 4 @.@ 4 beats per second for the barn swallow , but the flight speed of 11 m · s − 1 ( 36 ft · s − 1 ) is typical for hirundines . 
 The common house martin is a noisy species , especially at its breeding colonies . The male 's song , given throughout the year , is a soft twitter of melodious chirps . The contact call , also given on the wintering grounds , is a hard <unk> , and the alarm is a shrill <unk> . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The subspecies D. u. urbicum breeds across temperate Eurasia east to central Mongolia and the Yenisei River , and in Morocco , Tunisia and northern Algeria , and migrates on a broad front to winter in sub @-@ Saharan Africa . D. u. lagopodum breeds eastwards of the Yenisei to Kolyma and south to northern Mongolia and northern China ; it winters in southern China and Southeast Asia . 
 The preferred habitat of the common house martin is open country with low vegetation , such as pasture , meadows and farmland , and preferably near water , although it is also found in mountains up to at least 2 @,@ 200 metres ( 7 @,@ 200 ft ) altitude . It is much more urban than the barn swallow , and will nest even in city centres if the air is clean enough . It is more likely to be found near trees than other Eurasian swallows , since they provide insect food and also roosting sites . This species does not normally use the reed @-@ bed roosts favoured by migrating barn swallows . 
 It uses similar open habitats on the wintering grounds , but the common house martin is less conspicuous than wintering barn swallows , tending to fly higher and be more nomadic . In the tropical parts of its wintering range , like East Africa and Thailand , it appears to be mainly found in the higher areas . 
 The common house martin is a migrant which moves on a broad @-@ front ( i.e. European birds are not funnelled through the short sea crossings used by large soaring birds , but cross the Mediterranean and Sahara ) . While migrating they feed in the air on insects , and they usually travel in daylight . Migration brings its own hazards ; in 1974 , several hundred thousand birds of this species were found dead or dying in the Swiss Alps and surrounding areas , caught by heavy snowfall and low temperatures . Adult survival on autumn migration depends mainly on temperature , with precipitation another major factor , but for juveniles low temperatures during the breeding season are more critical . It is anticipated that since extreme weather is predicted to become more frequent with climate change , future survival rates will depend more on adverse weather conditions than at present . 
 The common house martin returns to the breeding grounds a few days after the first barn swallows ; like that species , particularly when the weather is poor , it seldom goes straight to the nesting sites , but hunts for food over large fresh water bodies . There are records of migrant house martins staying to breed in Namibia and South Africa instead of returning north . As would be expected for a long distance migrant , it has occurred as a vagrant eastwards to Alaska and west to Newfoundland , Bermuda and the Azores . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The common house martin was originally a cliff and cave nester , and some cliff @-@ nesting colonies still exist , with the nests built below an overhanging rock . It now largely uses human structures such as bridges and houses . Unlike the barn swallow , it uses the outside of inhabited buildings , rather than the inside of barns or stables . The nests are built at the junction of a vertical surface and an overhang , such as on house eaves , so that they may be strengthened by attachment to both planes . 
 Breeding birds return to Europe between April and May , and nest building starts between late March in North Africa and mid @-@ June in Lapland . The nest is a neat closed convex cup fixed below a suitable ledge , with a narrow opening at the top . It is constructed by both sexes with mud pellets collected in their beaks , and lined with grasses , hair or other soft materials . The mud , added in successive layers , is collected from ponds , streams or puddles . House sparrows frequently attempt to take over the nest during construction , with the house martins rebuilding elsewhere if they are successful . The entrance at the top of the cup is so small once it is complete that sparrows cannot take over the nest . 
 The common house martin tends to breed colonially , and nests may be built in contact with each other . A colony size of less than 10 nests is typical , but there are records of colonies with thousands of nests . Four or five white eggs are usually laid , which average 1 @.@ 9 x 1 @.@ 33 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 75 x 0 @.@ 52 in ) in size , and weigh 1 @.@ 7 grammes ( 0 @.@ 06 oz ) . The female does most of the incubation , which normally lasts 14 – 16 days . The newly hatched chicks are altricial , and after a further 22 – 32 days , depending on weather , the chicks leave the nest . The fledged young stay with , and are fed by , the parents for about a week after leaving the nest . Occasionally , first @-@ year birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood . 
 There are normally two broods each year , the nest being reused for the second brood , and repaired and used again in subsequent years . Hatching success is 90 % , and fledging survival 60 – 80 % . Third broods are not uncommon , though late nestlings are often left to starve . The average annual mortality for adults nesting in the Western Palaearctic is 40 – 60 % , with most deaths outside the breeding season . A study of British breeders gave an average adult survival rate of just under 40 % , but ranging from 25 % to 70 % . Rainfall in the African wintering grounds is a major factor in adult survival , although wet weather in the breeding areas has very little effect . Although individuals aged 10 and 14 years have been recorded , most survive less than five years . For weeks after leaving the nest the young congregate in ever @-@ increasing flocks which , as the season advances , may be seen gathering in trees or on <unk> , or on the wires with swallows . By the end of October , most martins have left their breeding areas in western and central Europe , though late birds in November and December are not uncommon , and further south migration finishes later anyway . 
 Once established , pairs remain together to breed for life ; however , extra @-@ pair copulations are common , making this species genetically polygamous , despite being socially monogamous . A Scottish study showed that 15 % of nestlings were not related to their putative fathers , and 32 % of broods contained at least one extra @-@ pair chick . Extra @-@ pair males , usually from nests where laying had already taken place , were often seen to enter other nests . The paired male initially ensured that his female spent little time alone at the nest , and accompanied her on flights , but the mate @-@ guarding slackened after egg laying began , so the youngest nestling was the most likely to have a different father . 
 The common house martin has been regularly recorded as hybridising with the barn swallow , this being one of the most common passerine interspecific crosses . The frequency of this hybrid has led to suggestions that Delichon is not sufficiently separated genetically from Hirundo to be considered a separate genus . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The common house martin is similar in habits to other aerial insectivores , including other swallows and martins and the unrelated swifts , and catches insects in flight . In the breeding areas , flies and aphids make up much of the diet , and in Europe , the house martin takes a larger proportion of aphids and small flies than the barn swallow . As with that species , hymenopterans , especially flying ants , are important food items in the wintering area . 
 This species hunts at an average height of 21 metres ( 70 ft ) during the breeding season , but lower in wet conditions . The hunting grounds are typically within 450 metres ( 1 @,@ 500 ft ) of the nest , with a preference for open ground or water , the latter especially in poor weather , but the martins will also follow the plough or large animals to catch disturbed insects . On the wintering grounds , hunting takes place at a greater height of over 50 metres ( 165 ft ) . 
 = = = Predators and parasites = = = 
 Although the common house martin is hunted by the hobby ( Falco subbuteo ) , its aerial skills enable it to evade most predators . 
 It is parasitised externally by fleas and mites , including the " house martin flea " , Ceratophyllus hirundinis , and internally by endoparasites such as Haemoproteus <unk> ( avian malaria ) , which are transmitted by blood @-@ sucking insects including mosquitoes . A Polish study showed that nests typically contained more than 29 specimens of ectoparasite , with C. hirundinis and Oeciacus hirundinis the most abundant . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 The common house martin has a large range , with an estimated global extent of 10 million square kilometres . Its European population is estimated to be 20 – 48 million individuals . Global population trends have not been quantified , although there is evidence of population fluctuations . For these reasons , the species is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List , and has no special status under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) which regulates international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants . In Europe and Britain however , population numbers indicate a declining trend , and leading conservation groups in Britain have updated the <unk> status to amber indicating medium conservation concern there . 
 This is a species which has greatly benefited historically from forest clearance creating the open habitats it prefers , and from human habitation which has given it an abundance of safe nest sites . However , populations can fluctuate locally for a number of reasons . New housing has created more nest sites , and clean @-@ air legislation has enabled breeding in the centre of major cities like London . The population of house martins in Sheffield , central UK , has been estimated at 12 @,@ 353 individuals . Conversely , poor weather , poisoning by agricultural pesticides , lack of mud for nest building and competition with house sparrows can reduce numbers . Widespread declines in common house martin numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe since 1970 . As an attractive bird which feeds on flying insects , the house martin has usually been tolerated by humans when it shares their buildings for nesting , although the accumulation of droppings below breeding birds can be a nuisance leading to some destruction of nests . 
 = = In literature and culture = = 
 This species lacks the wealth of literary references associated with its relative , the barn swallow , although it is possible that some of the older mentions for that bird might equally well refer to the house martin . William Shakespeare was clearly describing the house martin when Banquo brings the nests and birds to the attention of Duncan at Macbeth 's castle , Inverness : 
 " This guest of summer , 
 The temple @-@ haunting martlet , does approve 
 By his loved <unk> that the heaven 's breath 
 Smells <unk> here . No <unk> , frieze , 
 Buttress , nor <unk> of vantage , but this bird 
 Hath made his pendant bed and <unk> cradle ; 
 Where they most breed and haunt , I have observed 
 The air is delicate . " ( Macbeth , Act I , scene VI ) . 
 There are old legends , with no basis in fact , that house martins would wall @-@ up house sparrows by closing the entrance of the mud nest with the intruder inside , or that they would gather en masse to kill a sparrow . 
 The martlet , often believed to refer to the house martin , or possibly a swallow , was a heraldic bird with short tufts of feathers in the place of legs . It was the cadency mark of the fourth son of a noble family , and features in many coats of arms , including the Plantagenets . The lack of feet signified its inability to land , which explained its link to a younger son , also landless . It also represented swiftness .

 The Age of Adz ( pronounced / <unk> / ) is a 2010 album by American singer / songwriter Sufjan Stevens , released on October 12 , 2010 by Asthmatic Kitty . It is Stevens ' sixth studio album and his first song @-@ based full @-@ length album in five years , since the release of Illinois in 2005 . 
 The album features a heavy use of electronics augmented by orchestration , and takes inspiration from the apocalyptic artwork of schizophrenic artist Royal Robertson . Stevens ' use of electronics marked a radical departure from much of his previous work — most notably from Seven Swans and Michigan . Unlike Illinois , the lyrics do not explore events , characters or setting , but deal instead with themes and emotions on a personal level . 
 Critics praised the intimacy of the album , but many were divided over the change in style that Stevens had taken . Nonetheless , it appeared on several " best of 2010 " lists — including those of Paste , The New York Times and MTV . Commercially , the album gave Stevens his career 's best first week sales to date and was his highest charting album to date , peaking in the top ten on the Billboard 200 . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 In 2006 , Sufjan Stevens released an album of extra material left over from Illinois ( originally conceived as a double album ) , titled The Avalanche , as well as an album of Christmas music titled Songs for Christmas ( produced in parts between 2001 and 2006 ) . Following the release of The Avalanche , Stevens expressed a dissatisfaction with his music , stating in an interview with Pitchfork Media in 2006 : " I 'm getting tired of my voice . I 'm getting tired of ... the banjo . I 'm getting tired of ... the trumpet " . In 2009 Stevens admitted that his Fifty States Project — an attempt to write an album for each of the 50 U.S. States — had been a " promotional gimmick " and not something that he had seriously intended to complete . In the same year he released The BQE , an orchestral suite accompanying a home @-@ made film dedicated to the Brooklyn @-@ Queens Expressway . In an interview with <unk> Magazine in 2010 , Stevens stated " [ The BQE ] kinda sabotaged the mechanical way of approaching my music , which was basically narrative long @-@ form . It really opened things up for me . It also confused things as well . I don ’ t think I ever really fully recovered from that process " . On August 20 , 2010 , without prior announcement , Stevens released the EP All Delighted People , and less than one week later , announced The Age of Adz to be released on October 12 . 
 In interviews , Stevens stated that during 2009 – 2010 he suffered from a mysterious debilitating viral infection that affected his nervous system . He experienced chronic pain , and was forced to stop working on music for several months . He said : " The Age of Adz , is , in some ways , a result of that process of working through health issues and getting much more in touch with my physical self . That 's why I think the record 's really obsessed with sensation and has a hysterical melodrama to it . " 
 My Brightest Diamond frontwoman Shara Nova — who previously collaborated with Stevens as a backing vocalist on the albums The Avalanche and Illinois — has a solo performance on the track " Impossible Soul " , and provides backing vocals throughout the album . 
 The song " Vesuvius " was sampled in " Fade Away " by Social Club and <unk> Thomas and " All For Myself " was sampled in <unk> Ziv and Kiya Lacey 's " Babylon [ ER ] " and Kendrick Lamar 's " Hood Politics " . 
 = = = Artwork = = = 
 The artwork of Royal Robertson , a self @-@ proclaimed prophet from Louisiana , was used for the album 's cover and interior . Will Hermes of Rolling Stone said that Sufjan Stevens uses the artwork " as a springboard for music that evokes a visionary psyche . " Stevens became interested in the work of Robertson after recording music for a friend 's documentary on the artist , and said that " [ the more I studied him and his work ] , the more I felt a weird affinity to this guy and the story of his life . " He began to transcribe some of the text that appears in Robertson 's artwork , and says this process stayed with him a " long time " and " that some of it started to come up in the lyrics , in the songs I was writing .

 = = = Musical style = = = 
 The Age of Adz marked a radical departure in musical style from that of Stevens ' previous album Illinois . Robin Hilton summarised the changes as Stevens " [ replacing ] delicately plucked banjo lines , wispy vocals and sentimental melodies with glitchy soundscapes , hip @-@ hop [ sic ] beats and heavily filtered vocals . " Amongst his other work , the 2001 electronic album Enjoy Your Rabbit was regarded as being the most close in style to this album . Nevertheless , critics highlighted the first track " <unk> Devices " as being stylistically consistent with his earlier acoustic work . 
 Sufjan Stevens himself has said that the album 's tracks " are pop songs , but they ’ re based on sound experimentation and noise " .

 The Age of Adz departs from the geography @-@ based concepts of Stevens ' previous albums ; until his announcement in 2009 that he had never seriously intended to complete the project , it had been expected that his next work might continue the Fifty States Project that he had begun with Michigan and continued with Illinois . The album contains no " conceptual underpinnings " , instead focusing on themes that are personal and intimate to Stevens himself ; the label Asthmatic Kitty describes the themes as " personal and primal … love , sex , death , disease , illness , anxiety , and suicide " . 
 A recurrent focus of the album is love , a theme that sometimes overlaps with spirituality as Stevens seems to address both a lover and a divine power . Another important theme is that of mortality — the song " Now That I 'm Older " has been noted as " repeatedly [ acknowledging ] mortality and the importance of making the most of life . " Acknowledging the interplay of these two themes , the album has been described as having songs " in which love and death reign darkly over an imaginative landscape peopled with apparitions , ghosts , orators and space travellers " .

It was his highest charting album to date , peaking in the top ten on the Billboard 200 . It also placed number one on Billboard 's " Rock Albums " , " Independent Albums " , " Alternative Albums " and " Folk Albums " lists , and placed number two on the " Digital Albums " and " Tastemaker Albums " lists .

 The Age of Adz received widespread critical acclaim upon its release . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 80 , based on 33 reviews , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . Keith <unk> of the Frontier Psychiatrist described the album as " a musical masterpiece that blends analog and digital sounds as it reflects on love and loss , life and death , humanity and divinity " . Entertainment.ie 's Jenny Mulligan described Stevens as " a strange one , that 's for sure , but he may just be a genius " . Uncut commented that the album provides plenty of evidence to argue that he is either " one of the most important songwriters of his generation " or " just an infuriating , neurotic show @-@ off " . Alexis Petridis of The Guardian said that although the album " goes a bit barmy and over @-@ the @-@ top " there are some " incredible tune [ s ] " that are " not only genuinely remarkable , but genuinely enjoyable " . Alex Denney of NME similarly commented that the album " conjures just enough moments of heart @-@ stopping <unk> to foot the bill for its dizzying excesses " . Sam Lewis of the BBC remarked on the same point : that the album is " suffused with individual moments of brilliance " , but overall it is " let down by its self @-@ conscious incoherence " . 
 The most discussed track of the album among reviewers was " Impossible Soul " , which at 25 minutes in length comprises a third of the overall album . Pitchfork 's reviewer Ryan Dombal described the track as having " more engaging ideas than most artists could muster in a career " , although No Ripcord reviewer Alan Shulman criticized the middle sections as being an " epic train wreck " , saying that the closing minutes come as " a breath of fresh air " . One Thirty BPM reviewer Rob <unk> was mixed in his reception of the track , and commented that it would " make or break " the album for listeners , describing it as a successful " proclamation of love " , but also " bloated " and " way over the top " .

 = Image Lake = 
 Image Lake is a tarn in Glacier Peak Wilderness , in the North Cascades of Washington , United States . The lake is surrounded by Plummer Peak to the east , a lookout point to the west , the Miners Creek drainage and Glacier Peak to the south , and Canyon Lake to the north . The course of the popular Miners Ridge Trail skirts the lake . Glacier Peak can be seen from the outlet of the lake , and the peak reflected in the lake is a popular photographic subject . 
 As a result of a relatively mild temperate climate with ample precipitation , the areas around Image Lake boast rich natural habitats with many species of plants , insects , rodents , and large mammals . Native Americans took advantage of these resources , and may have inhabited the area seasonally . However , human activity such as hunting , fishing , and mining , and recreational overuse increased after the arrival of Europeans . As a result , some areas experienced significant environmental degradation near the end of the end of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth century , including the eradication of large predatory animals . Recreational overuse and the presence of livestock were especially problematic in the early to mid @-@ twentieth century . 
 = = Climate = = 
 Image Lake is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America . Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean , and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains , which surround Image Lake . As fronts from approach the North Cascades , they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range , causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades . As a result , the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation , especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall . Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean , areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below 0 ° F ( − 18 ° C ) or above 80 ° F ( 27 ° C ) . During winter months , weather is usually cloudy , but , due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months , there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer . Because of maritime influence , snow tends to be wet and heavy , resulting in high avalanche danger . 
 Global warming is expected to have a number of negative long @-@ term ecological impacts on the region , including drought , increased forest fires , forest degradation to drought and disease , and less healthy or nonexistent salmon runs . The distribution and survival of plant species , especially those that inhabit alpine environments , as well as animals that are specifically adapted to those environments , will also be adversely affected . Glaciers are also expected to recede due to a decreased buildup of snowpack and higher overall temperatures . 
 = = Hydrology = = 
 Image Lake has a drainage basin with an area of less than 1 square mile ( 2 @.@ 6 km2 ) . Its primary outflow is a small , unnamed creek that feeds into Miners Creek , which in turn drains into the Suiattle River . The Suiattle River drains into the Skagit River , which in turn empties into Puget Sound . The highest point in the drainage basin is nearly 7 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) above sea level . The lake itself is roughly circular , and has an area of about 3 – 4 acres ( 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 6 ha ) . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Subduction and tectonic activity began in the area began during the late cretaceous period , about 90 million years ago . The area was previously an oceanic environment , consisting mainly of sedimentary and volcanic rocks . Extensive volcanic activity began to take place in the <unk> , about 35 million years ago . However , mountain building in the area did not begin until the <unk> , approximately 10 million years ago . Image Lake is located in the Cloudy Pass batholith , an intrusive formation that was formed approximately 20 million years ago , during the early <unk> . Glacier Peak , a stratovolcano that is south of Image Lake , began forming in the mid @-@ Pleistocene . Due to Glacier Peak 's proximity to Image Lake , volcanic ash is quite common in the area , and plays a major role in the formation of soil . 
 Throughout the ice age , the North Cascades were mostly covered in thick glaciers , extending to near Puget Sound . Glaciation was most prevalent approximately 18 @,@ 000 years ago , and most valleys were ice @-@ free by 12 @,@ 000 years ago . As a result , valleys in the area are deep and u @-@ shaped , and mountains tend to be rocky , with steep slopes and narrow summits . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Flora = = = 
 Image Lake and the surrounding area is in the North Cascades ecoregion , and temperate rainforests grow at lower elevations , such as in the Suiattle River valley . Common trees in this habitat include western redcedar , western hemlock , and Douglas fir . At middle elevations , forests are dominated by Pacific silver fir and , to a lesser extent , Alaska cedar . Devil 's club and huckleberry grow in moist areas on the forest floor . However , <unk> and salal dominate in drier areas . The mid @-@ elevation forests also receive more precipitation , especially in the form of snowfall , than lower elevations . Western hemlock and Douglas fir are also present , especially at the lower edge of the mid @-@ elevation forest zone . At higher elevations , Douglas fir and redcedar are largely replaced by mountain hemlock and Alaska cedar , which both become more common as elevation increases . The mid @-@ elevation forest zone often occupies the steepest slopes on the mountainside , which result in the occurrence of avalanche tracks . Avalanche tracks are usually occupied by scrub such as Sitka alder , as well as smaller shrubs and herbs . 
 At higher elevations , mountain hemlock and subalpine fir are the most common trees . Alaska cedar and whitebark pine are also present . However , as the elevation increases , the forest becomes increasingly fragmented , and is interspersed with meadows consisting of grasses , herbs , and shrubs . Scree slopes are also common . Temperatures can vary greatly within one day due to the high altitude of the habitat and lack of forest cover . For the same reasons , the parkland also experiences increased solar radiation . At the upper edge of the parkland , trees tend to be stunted , and grow in small clumps . Common shrubs include heather and mountain huckleberry . Off @-@ trail hiking can be very destructive in the sub @-@ alpine zone . 
 Above the subalpine zone , trees become less common . Trees that do manage to gain a foothold are often stunted , with contorted branches due to high winds , increased snowfall , and growing seasons of 2 – 3 months . These trees are known as " krummholz " , which means " bent wood " in German . Heather , herbs , and grasses are also present , but are often very sparse . Temperatures often fluctuate greatly , making for a difficult growing season . 
 = = = Fauna = = = 
 Wildlife is common in the area 's ecosystem . Marmots tend to live in large social groups , and play a role in regulating the alpine vegetation . Eagles , hawks , coyotes , and badgers are common predatory animals . Clark 's nutcrackers and gray jays are also common , and various species of grouse are present . Insects and hummingbirds are common pollinators . 
 Larger animals are not as common , but are still present . A grizzly bear was photographed near Cascade pass in October 2010 , and as many as twenty grizzlies may be living in the Cascades , south of the Canadian border . Wolves , pine martens lynx , wolverines , cougars , weasels , and black bears are also present , and are usually detected by camera traps . During the summer , bears consume up to 30 @,@ 000 calories a day in preparation for hibernation , in a dietary phase known as hyperphagia . There have also been attempts to re @-@ introduce fishers to the region . Cougars are mainly nocturnal and solitary , and are so secretive that they are seldom seen . Wolves were eradicated from the Cascades by the 1930s , but began re @-@ establishing resident packs at least as early as 1990 . 
 The most common large herbivore is the black @-@ tailed deer , a subspecies of the mule deer . Elk and moose are less common . Mountain goats are well @-@ adapted to steep terrain and cold temperatures , and are not usually found at lower elevations . There are eight species of bats that live in the North Cascades . 
 = = History = = 
 There is archaeological evidence that Native Americans had been using the area for at least 8 @,@ 500 years before present , and had been present at Cascade Pass for at least 9 @,@ 600 years . Wild game was apparently utilized by Native Americans , and obsidian was exploited since at least 5 @,@ 000 years before present . They used several routes that passed through the region , and may have used its natural resources during the summer . Some tribes personified the mountains and incorporated them into their religions . Many of these routes followed ridge tops in order to avoid the dense brush and avalanche chutes of the valley bottoms . Horses were also used in the eighteenth century . There was a trail used by Native Americans as a route between Lake Chelan and the Suiattle River valley . The trail apparently traversed Cloudy Pass , which is some distance east of the lake . It was later used by miners and shepherds in the early 1900s . <unk> was banned on Miners Ridge in 1940 , but the popularity of the area continued to grow . Due to the area 's popularity , the surrounding meadows deteriorated as a result of livestock grazing and off @-@ trail hiking . As a result , livestock were allocated to the nearby Lady Camp Basin and hardier plants were introduced to the area surrounding the lake . 
 Image Lake was originally called " Mirror Lake " , but was given its present name on April 10 , 1940 by Hugh Ritter and Rudo Fromme , who were employees of the US Forest Service . The lake was first surveyed on July 14 , 1939 by the Forest Service . 
 Kennecott Copper Corporation , as of 1988 , planned to dig an open @-@ pit copper mine in a basin approximately one mile east of Image Lake . However , protests by various advocacy groups , such as The Mountaineers , prevented the plan from developing further . 
 In 2003 , floods washed out large portions of the Suiattle River Road , beginning 12 @.@ 5 miles ( 20 @.@ 1 km ) from the trailhead , making Image Lake more accessible from Holden or Trinity . As of August 2013 , construction crews are repairing the road , which is scheduled to be open by 2014 . However , the Forest Service has a limited budget , and the effort to rebuild the road has been criticized by environmental groups , partly because of the lower amount of visitors , since access from the west has become almost impossible . Since Image Lake is all but inaccessible from the west , it is necessary for hikers to access the lake from the east , via a two @-@ day hike from Holden or Trinity .

 The trail to Image Lake can be accessed from the Suiattle River Road . However , the road is , as of July 2013 , washed out approximately 12 @.@ 5 miles ( 20 @.@ 1 km ) from the trailhead , which has made access more difficult . However , it can still be accessed from Holden , on the east side of the Cascade crest , west of Lake Chelan . The trail begins by following the Suiattle River , eventually reaching open meadows with views of Glacier Peak . There is also an alpine route that leads from the Miners Ridge Trail to Plummer Mountain , and a little used trail that leads to Canyon Lake and Totem Pass , which is about 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) southeast of Dome Peak . 2016 Update : The Suiattle River road was fixed in 2015 .

 = Half a Life ( Star Trek : The Next Generation ) = 
 " Half a Life " is the 22nd episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : The Next Generation , the 96th episode overall . It was originally released on May 6 , 1991 , in broadcast syndication . The episode was the first of the series written by Peter Allan Fields , who later joined the writing staff . Director Les Landau said that " Half a Life " was a morality play about " how society deals with the elderly " . 
 Set in the 24th century , the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Federation starship Enterprise . In this episode , Lwaxana Troi ( Majel Barrett ) falls in love with Timicin ( David Ogden Stiers ) , a Kaelon scientist who is attempting to test his theories of stellar ignition in the hopes of saving his world 's dying star . The experiment fails , and Lwaxana encourages Timicin to continue his research , but as he is about to turn sixty years of age , he prepares instead for a ritual suicide . According to Timicin 's cultural tradition , his people voluntarily choose euthanasia to prevent the aged from becoming a burden to the younger generation . 
 The episode features the first appearance of Michelle Forbes in the Star Trek franchise ; she would later appear as Ensign Ro Laren during season five . The cast praised the story and the expansion of the Lwaxana character . The episode received positive reviews , with critics noting the performances of Stiers and Barrett , their character 's love story , and the changes to the Lwaxana character . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The U.S.S. Enterprise takes aboard Deanna Troi 's ( Marina Sirtis ) eccentric mother Lwaxana ( Majel Barrett ) and Dr. Timicin ( David Ogden Stiers ) of Kaelon II . Timicin is brought aboard to conduct an experiment which he hopes will save his threatened home planet , as its sun is in a state of near @-@ collapse . The Federation enlists the Enterprise to take Timicin to a sun in a similar state of decay to conduct experiments which may yield a method for saving the Kaelon system from destruction . 
 Upon arrival at their destination , the crew assists Timicin in modifying a photon torpedo to launch into the proxy sun with the expectation that it will repair the damaged star and prove that the technique can be safely applied to the Kaelon sun . The torpedo is fired and , although the experiment seems initially to work , the effect is short @-@ lived and the experiment fails to have the intended result . The Enterprise returns to Kaelon II . Timicin is crushed , and after some questioning by Lwaxana , he reveals that there are other things troubling him . Timicin tells Lwaxana that he is about to turn 60 , and on Kaelon II , everyone who reaches that age performs the " Resolution " , a ritual act of voluntary euthanasia . Lwaxana is outraged to learn of this and brings it to the attention of Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) . Picard makes it clear to Lwaxana that due to the Prime Directive , he will not interfere in the planet 's local affairs . Lwaxana tries to beam herself down to the planet to halt the process herself but she is thwarted by Deanna who comforts her . 
 After Lwaxana and Timicin spend an evening together , he tries to explain the custom of the Resolution . He tells her that a fixed age had to be selected by the <unk> because just randomly choosing a time to die would be heartless . Lwaxana finds the practice barbaric and refuses to accept the Kaelon tradition . She tells Timicin how a <unk> woman on her planet successfully fought the tradition of wearing ornate wigs that contained live , captive birds . It only took one courageous woman to step forward and end this cruel tradition . Lwaxana also compares Timicin 's plans to end his life with his research to save his star . If it is Timicin 's time to die , Lwaxana argues , perhaps it is also time for his star to die as well , so why should he continue to try to prevent it ? Timicin thinks about what Lwaxana has told him . 
 Timicin 's analysis of the failed test turns up some promising options , but if he follows through with the Resolution , no one will have his experience and knowledge to carry on his work to save his world . Concerned , Timicin requests asylum on the Enterprise so that he can renounce the Resolution and continue his research . B <unk> ( Terrence E. McNally ) , the Science Minister on Kaelon II , is outraged after learning of Timicin 's request for asylum , and he sends up two warships to ensure that the Enterprise does not leave the system with Timicin on board . As Picard orders the bridge crew to analyze the offensive capabilities of the <unk> ships , Timicin realizes that his situation is not as simple as he had hoped , for his home planet will not accept any further reports from him , and he is told that even if he does find a solution , they will not accept it . 
 Dara ( Michelle Forbes ) , Timicin 's daughter , beams on board the Enterprise to insist that he return to Kaelon II and undergo the Resolution . She tells him that she cannot bear the thought of him being laid to rest anywhere but next to her mother and , although she loves him , she is ashamed of him . Timicin realizes that he is not the man to forge a cultural revolution , and agrees to return to Kaelon II . Lwaxana , despite her disagreement , realizes that Timicin 's decision is his to make . As it is the custom for loved ones to be present at the Resolution , Lwaxana beams down to be with him at his side as he dies .

 " Half a Life " was the first Star Trek credit for writer Peter Allan Fields , who would later co @-@ write the " The Inner Light " with Morgan Gendel before becoming a staff writer on Star Trek : The Next Generation during season five . Prior to writing the script , Fields reviewed " Haven " and " Manhunt " , the two previous Lwaxana Troi episodes , but did not use them as references except to note Lwaxana 's level of privilege . " I realized that you give her as much as they 'll let her have . She 'll take it " , he explained . 
 Marina Sirtis , who played Lwaxana 's daughter Deanna Troi on the show , thought that compared to earlier episodes , " Half a Life " showed a different side of her character 's mother . Lwaxana 's interactions in the episode , argues Sirtis , considerably broadened the character ; previous episodes had a tendency to become centered around Deanna and Lwaxana . Sirtis and director Les Landau felt that the plot of " Half a Life " resembled a morality play . Landau noted the similarity between the episode and the morality play @-@ style plots that franchise creator Gene Roddenberry included in Star Trek : The Original Series . " It deals with the whole issue of growing old and how society deals with the elderly and , in my mind , it was one of the most pertinent story @-@ lines I have done " , Landau recalled .

 The episode guest starred David Ogden Stiers , best known for his role as Major Charles Emerson Winchester III on the American television series M * A * S * H. Stiers , a fan of Star Trek : The Next Generation , was enthusiastic when the producers asked him if he would be interested in appearing on the show . On the set during production , Stiers met Gene Roddenberry , the series producer , and was invited to his house to practice scenes with Roddenberry 's wife , Majel Barrett . Stiers described Roddenberry as " a grand old man - not in his behaviour but in people 's deference to him " . 
 Speaking highly of the story in " Half a Life " , Stiers indicated that the mood of the episode accentuated the debate over Timicin 's decision to end his life . " It was an emotionally involved piece . The script quite responsibly argued both sides [ of the suicide ] issue and left the viewer to determine whether such a practice is acceptable or not , " Stiers said . " That episode was more powerful than simply a discussion . " 
 Michelle Forbes makes her first The Next Generation appearance in " Half a Life " , in a performance which led directly to her later casting in the larger role of Ensign Ro Laren , a recurring character from season five onwards .

 " Half a Life " was first released within the United States on May 6 , 1991 , in broadcast syndication . Keith DeCandido , in a review for Tor.com , commended Stiers ' acting , saying that he gave " a noble , nuanced performance as Timicin . " He also approved of the episode , saying that it was the first time that Lwaxana Troi was treated as a real character without causing him to cringe ; at the same time , DeCandido did not forget the problems with her previous appearances on the show . Noting that it was one of the best episodes to feature a Prime Directive debate , DeCandido endorsed the writer 's idea not to take sides regarding the suicide . " This is a magnificent , tragic love story , one that takes a thin character and gives her depth , one that gives us a beautifully realized guest character in Timicin ( casting Stiers was a masterstroke , as he always brings subtle nuance to his roles ) , and one that takes its issues seriously , " DeCandido wrote . He gave the episode a score of eight out of ten , later concluding that it featured " one of the show 's most tragic love stories . " 
 In their book The Unauthorized Trek : The Complete Next Generation , James Van Hise and Hal Schuster observed a significant improvement in Majel Barrett 's performance in this episode compared to her previous appearances . They said that Barrett was " capable of depth and feeling " , and described the ending of the episode as " touching and disturbing " . A society shouldn 't naturally evolve to include ritual suicide , Van Hise and Schuster argue , but population control methods such as the one @-@ child policy in China , appear linked to a similar required effect , albeit through different means . 
 Reviewing the episode for The A.V. Club , Zack Handlen said that Timicin served as an " excellent foil " for Lwaxana and made her " seem less ridiculous " . The relationship between Lwaxana and Timicin " has a believable core " , even if it is " broad and arguably rushed " , writes Handlen . " There are some powerful moments ... and it 's pleasant for once to see Lwaxana adding , rather than subtracting , from a storyline . " Handlen , however , criticizes the setup of Timicin 's situation , as it reduced the characterization available to some of the Enterprise crew . In spite of its flaw , Handlen decides that " the episode largely redeems itself by staying true to its main point : No matter how much time you have left , it 's never enough . " 
 " Half a Life " was first released on VHS cassette in the United States and Canada on July 23 , 1996 . The episode was later released in the United States on September 3 , 2002 , as part of the Star Trek : The Next Generation season four DVD box set .

 Between May 2010 and July 2011 , the concentration of dissolved oxygen in West Creek ranged from slightly under eight milligrams per liter in May 2010 to nearly seventeen milligrams per liter in late January 2011 . This is well above the minimum required concentration of dissolved oxygen for optimal fish habitation . 
 West Creek is less affected by episodic acidification than most of the rest of the upper Fishing Creek watershed , with the exception of Coles Creek .

The aluminum concentration is , in fact , usually approximately zero and is often under 40 micrograms per liter . However , early in 2011 , the concentration was observed twice to be nearly 60 micrograms per liter . 
 The discharge of West Creek is usually less than two cubic meters per second .

 West Creek has been known by its current name since at least the late 1830s . The creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2 , 1979 . Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is <unk> . 
 In 1799 , a schoolhouse was constructed on West Creek near Benton . It was one of the first schoolhouses in the vicinity of Benton . During the 1864 elections , at least two Union soldiers were stationed on the creek , guarding the polling venues . A mill called the Thomas Mill was built on the creek in 1865 and remained operational in 1914 , when it was owned by N.B. Cole . In the late 1800s and early 1900s , there was a timber @-@ producing business on the creek , run by J. Harvey <unk> . 
 In 1881 , J. J. McHenry constructed a queen truss covered bridge over West Creek for $ 348 @.@ 00 . The bridge was moved to South Branch Roaring Creek when it was sold to H. H. <unk> in 1936 .

 There are 41 macroinvertebrate taxa that have been observed in West Creek , more than have been observed in all of upper Fishing Creek . The number of macroinvertebrates per square meter in West Creek at the site <unk> ( in the lower reaches of the creek ) is nearly 900 , which is far higher than the number of macroinvertebrates per square meter in any other site except the site WC2 , in the middle reaches of the creek . Site WC2 has a macroinvertebrate density of 600 macroinvertebrates per square meter . Approximately 60 % of the taxa are Ephemeroptera ( mayflies ) , 10 % each are Plecoptera ( stoneflies ) , and approximately 5 % are Trichoptera ( caddisflies ) . 
 There are a total of eight species of wild fish in West Creek . Brook trout and brown trout both inhabit West Creek , although brook trout are slightly more common than brown trout , with nine brook trout and only seven brown trout being observed in a 2010 or 2011 electrofishing survey . Trout are more common upstream of the Pennsylvania Route 239 crossing of the creek than downstream of it . The most common fish in the creek are sculpin , blacknose dace , and cutlips minnows . In the aforementioned electrofishing survey , a total of 81 sculpin , 34 black @-@ nosed dace , and 17 cutlips minnows were observed . Other species of fish in the watershed include <unk> darter , white sucker , and creek chub . 
 In 2011 , the habitat quality of upper Fishing Creek and its tributaries were rated on a scale of 1 to 200 ( with a higher rating indicating better habitability ) by Point Park University and the Fishing Creek Sportsmans ' Association . The headwaters of West Creek were given a rating of 192 . The rating is significantly lower further downstream , with it being 175 downstream of the crossing of Pennsylvania Route 239 .

 = California State Polytechnic University , Pomona = 
 California State Polytechnic University , Pomona ( CPP , Cal Poly Pomona , or Cal Poly ) is a public polytechnic university located in Pomona , California , United States . It is one of two polytechnics in the 23 @-@ member California State University system and one of only seven in all of the United States . The university is the second largest campus in the CSU , and with an enrollment of 22 @,@ 156 students , it is the second largest polytechnic university in the United States . In Fall of 2013 , it had 1 @,@ 059 faculty , of which 442 ( or 42 percent ) were on the tenure track . 
 The university is designated a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security . Cal Poly is one of three <unk> , and one of only five California institutions , with this distinction . The university has the oldest and largest Hospitality Management College in all of California , and one of the largest in the US with over 1 @,@ 000 students . Additionally , Cal Poly has the largest civil engineering student population in the nation . It is the only university in Southern California to grant bachelor 's and master 's degrees in agriculture . 
 Cal Poly Pomona currently offers 94 different bachelor 's degrees , 39 master 's degrees , 13 teaching credentials and a doctorate across 9 distinct academic colleges . The university is one among a small group of polytechnic universities in the United States which tend to be primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences . 
 Cal Poly Pomona began as the southern branch of the California Polytechnic School ( today known as Cal Poly San Luis Obispo ) in 1938 when a completely equipped school and farm in the city of San Dimas were donated by Charles Voorhis and his son Jerry Voorhis . The satellite campus grew further in 1949 when a horse ranch in the neighboring city of Pomona , which had belonged to Will Keith Kellogg , was acquired from the University of California . Cal Poly Pomona , then known as Cal Poly Kellogg @-@ Voorhis , and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo continued operations under a unified administrative control until they became independent from each other in 1966 . 
 Its sports teams are known as the Cal Poly Pomona Broncos and play in the NCAA Division II as part of the California Collegiate Athletic Association ( CCAA ) . The Broncos sponsor 10 varsity sports and have won 14 NCAA national championships . 
 = = History = = 
 Events leading to the foundation of present @-@ day Cal Poly at Pomona began with the demise of the Voorhis School for Boys in San Dimas , California and its acquisition by the San Luis Obispo @-@ based California Polytechnic School in 1938 . 
 The California Polytechnic School was founded as a vocational high school when California Governor Henry Gage signed the Polytechnic School Bill on March 8 , 1901 after its drafting by school founder Myron Angel . Voorhis School , on the other hand , had been established in 1928 as a private vocational school which provided elementary schooling for underprivileged boys and operated under the Christian religious principle , " education coupled with the Kingdom of God " . Its founder Charles B. Voorhis and headmaster Jerry Voorhis maintained the school opened throughout the worst years of the Great Depression but persistent economic pressures forced them to transfer control to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1938 . Hence , Voorhis School became the Cal Poly @-@ Voorhis Unit and its educational offerings were raised to the same level as Cal Poly San Luis Obispo ’ s – then a two @-@ year college . The entire horticulture program was moved to the new satellite campus and the two units operated as one institution spanning two locations under the leadership of president Julian McPhee . 
 During World War II most of the student body was called to active duty , enrollment declined and the campus closed in 1943 . Reopening after the war , Cal Poly @-@ Voorhis Unit operated in San Dimas until 1956 when it moved to Will Keith Kellogg ’ s former horse ranch in the neighboring city of Pomona , California . Acknowledging its Kellogg legacy , Cal Poly @-@ Voorhis Unit changed its name to Cal Poly Kellogg @-@ Voorhis Unit and offered six programs in agriculture . The inaugural class of 1957 at the new campus consisted of 57 students graduating with Bachelor ’ s degrees in a ceremony held at the Rose Garden in Pomona and religious services at Voorhis Chapel in San Dimas . Also in 1957 , Cal Poly Kellogg @-@ Voorhis introduced the College of Engineering , the second academic unit after the College of Agriculture . The California Master Plan for Higher Education added the two Cal Poly campuses to the new California State College system in 1961 and Cal Poly Kellogg @-@ Voorhis Unit opened its doors for the first time to 329 female students . President McPhee retired in 1966 , and Cal Poly split into two different and independent universities . The partnership between the two campuses remains with their involvement in the annual Cal Poly Universities Rose Float . 
 To better reflect its new ties to the State College system , Cal Poly Kellogg @-@ Voorhis changed its name to “ California State Polytechnic College , Kellogg @-@ Voorhis ” in 1966 and became the 16th campus to officially join . Robert C. Kramer assumed presidency of the independent campus in 1966 ( second overall as the university recognizes McPhee as its first ) and California State Polytechnic College , Kellogg @-@ Voorhis finally adopted its present @-@ day name California State Polytechnic University , Pomona on June 1 , 1972 . 
 In 1998 , Cal Poly Pomona received criticism when it planned to grant an honorary degree to Robert Mugabe . Mugabe ’ s negative humanitarian record as president of Zimbabwe lead to protests from staff , faculty and students , ultimately forcing the university to rescind the award . 
 Cal Poly Pomona underwent further growth in the late 20th and early 21st centuries , with the construction of the CLA Building ( now soon to be demolished ) , academic facilities , expansion to the Cal Poly Pomona University Library and the addition of programs such as the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies , the I @-@ Poly High School and the <unk> Bronco undergraduate research program . Under then @-@ president J. Michael Ortiz , Cal Poly Pomona launched its first comprehensive capital campaign in fall of 2008 to increase its permanent endowment . Nevertheless , the negative economic effects caused by the late @-@ 2000s recession has increased student fees , reduced enrollment availability , eliminated two athletic programs and introduced a mandatory furlough calendar for most of its 47 @,@ 000 employees . 
 = = = Name = = = 
 The campus ' office of public affairs recognizes two official names for the university : " California State Polytechnic University , Pomona " and " Cal Poly Pomona " . However , " Cal Poly " has also been used to refer to Cal Poly at Pomona , as both itself and California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo , California were one institution spanning two locations from 1938 to 1966 . Cal Poly 's office of public affairs recommends not to abbreviate the university 's name merely as " Cal Poly " . In the years when the University of California was in charge of Kellogg 's donated estate in Pomona ( 1932 – 1943 ) , the names " University of California , W.K. Kellogg Institute " and " W.K. Kellogg Institute of Animal Husbandry University of California , Pomona " , came into use to describe the site . Although Cal Poly at Pomona is now part of the California State University , its naming convention does not follow that of most campuses within the system ( for example , the CSU campus in San Diego bears the full official name " San Diego State University " and the CSU campus in Fullerton uses the name " California State University , Fullerton " ) . Thus , " Pomona State University " and " California State University , Pomona " are seldom used and not in the university 's graphic standard 's manual .

 Cal Poly Pomona is situated in Pomona , a largely suburban city that is part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area . The city of Pomona is located in the eastern portion of Los Angeles County and borders the neighboring county of San Bernardino to the east . The university ’ s 1 @,@ 725 acres ( 698 ha ) campus make it the second largest in the California State University system , a figure which includes various facilities scattered throughout Southern California such as a 53 @-@ acre ( 21 ha ) ranch in Santa Paula , California , 25 @-@ acre ( 10 ha ) campus at the former <unk> Landfill ( now known as " <unk> Ranch " ) , and the Neutra <unk> Studio and Residences in West Los Angeles . The university is currently negotiating the transfer of the 302 acre Lanterman Developmental Center from the State of California . The land is to be used for academic purposes and expansion of the Innovation Village and also shared by the California Highway Patrol , the California Air Resources Board and the California Conservation Corps . The transfer of the land is part of the Governor 's 2015 @-@ 2016 Proposed Budget . 
 Although part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area , the university is in close proximity to two other large metropolitan and culturally @-@ defined regions , the Inland Empire and Orange County . The university has a tier 1 area , defined as a geographical admissions region surrounding the campus , roughly bounded by the San Gabriel Mountains to the north , the city of Chino Hills to the south , Interstate 605 to the west , and Interstate 15 to the east . Cal Poly Pomona 's campus buildings vary in age and style from the Mission Revival Kellogg Horse Stables and the Kellogg House ( suggesting the Spanish colonial architectural heritage of Southern California ) built in the 1920s ; the modernist box @-@ like portion of the library completed in 1969 ; to contemporary dormitories , engineering , science and library @-@ expansion facilities completed in the early 21st century . 
 Leisure and recreational locations include a rose garden which dates back to the Kellogg horse ranch years ; the Kellogg House designed by Los Angeles @-@ based architects Charles Gibbs Adams , Myron Hunt and Harold Coulson Chambers in the 1920s ; and a 1 @.@ 3 acres ( 0 @.@ 53 ha ) Japanese garden built in 2003 and designed by Takeo Uesugi . Kellogg ’ s House features grounds which were initially landscaped by Charles Gibbs Adams but were later completed by Florence <unk> & Lucile Council . Cal Poly Pomona 's George and <unk> Aratani Japanese Garden is one among four under management by institutions of higher education in the County of Los Angeles , the others being the Earl Burns Miller Japanese Garden at Cal State Long Beach , the Hannah Carter Japanese Garden at UCLA , and the Shinwa @-@ En Garden at Cal State Dominguez Hills . At the center of the campus and atop <unk> are the buildings of the Collins College of Hospitality Management and Kellogg West , a hotel and conference center and home of the student / faculty @-@ run Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch . 
 At the northwest part of the campus is the Voorhis Ecological Reserve , which serves as a 31 hectares ( 77 acres ) wildlife corridor containing Coastal Sage Scrub and Coast Live Oak trees among others . Contrasting some of these architecturally prominent facilities , there are various portable buildings on campus which are used to accommodate the growing enrollment of recent decades . Cal Poly Pomona operates the International Polytechnic High School , a college preparatory high school located on campus . 
 Cal Poly Pomona 's dominant landmark is a futurist @-@ styled administrative facility known as the CLA Building which was designed by Antoine Predock and opened in 1993 . The building ’ s peculiar shape ( standing out by a triangular @-@ shaped “ <unk> ” atop its eight @-@ story tower ) has become a symbol of the university ; in addition , its close location to film studios based in the Hollywood borough of Los Angeles have prompted its inclusion in motion pictures such as Gattaca and Impostor . As of 2013 , the California State University Board of Trustees have voted to demolish the building and replace it with a new academic / faculty complex due to severe seismic risks . 
 Noted modernist architect James Pulliam once served as campus architect and instructor and designed the Bookstore , W. Keith and Janet Kellogg Art Gallery , Interim Design Center ( IDC ) and Student Union building which architectural historian David Gebhard regarded as the best building on campus .

Another academic facility highlighting the Kellogg legacy is the Horse Stables ( also known as University Plaza ) which contains a small research library specializing in equine studies along with offices for student services and various campus organizations . 
 Conceived in 1995 by then university president , Bob H. Suzuki , and initially financed by NASA and the Economic Development Administration , the Innovation Village is a 65 @-@ acre ( 26 ha ) public / private partnership research and business facility at the southern edge of the campus . Major tenants include the American Red Cross , Southern California Edison , and the NASA Commercialization Center . The project is currently at the halfway mark of building and leasing 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 square feet ( 93 @,@ 000 m2 ) of the projected total building space . Once complete , it is estimated that the project would employ 2000 to 3000 people and provide half a billion dollars of economic benefits to the local , regional and state economies .

 The university has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus . In November 2007 , Cal Poly became a signatory member of the American College & University Presidents Climate Commitment . Among other things , this committed the university to ensure that within one year , it would purchase or produce at least 15 % of the institution 's electric consumption from renewable sources . The university , along with other members in the CSU , is also a member of the California Climate Action <unk> and lists on The Princeton Review 's Guide to 286 Green Colleges . 
 Cal Poly Pomona 's institute for sustainability education is the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies . The center was built adjacent to an old landfill and conducts research in the areas of sustainable technology and agriculture . As an example of Cradle to Cradle Design , it uses solar @-@ powered dormitories , aquaculture ponds , and organic gardens while providing an environmentally @-@ sustainable housing accommodation for 22 graduate students . In 2010 , with the installation of a 210 @,@ 000 kW hours CPV system by <unk> , the center became the first carbon neutral facility in the California State University system . The center is part of <unk> , a 40 @-@ acre ( 16 ha ) research project that showcases environmental and agricultural sustainable practices including methods to grow food , conserve water and energy and recycle urban waste . <unk> is home of the Farm Store at Kellogg Ranch which sells locally and campus grown foods and products . The Cal Poly campus also contains a rainforest greenhouse , a California ethnobotany garden , and an aquatic biology center collectively known as <unk> , which provides environmental education to all academic levels . 
 The entire campus community is served by a free campus shuttle system known as " Bronco Express " . The shuttle system has 3 lines and is run by the office of Parking & Transportation Services ( PTS ) . In addition , PTS also offers a shuttle service known as " <unk> " which provides both students and faculty a direct connection from the Pomona North and Downtown Pomona Metrolink stations to the CLA Building . 
 Foothill Transit lines 190 , 194 , 195 , 289 , 480 , 482 , and 486 serve the campus daily .

 Although it 's believed that the San Jose Fault runs through campus , and geotechnical investigations have been conducted , there is uncertainty regarding its precise type and location . The CLA Building suffers from structural flaws , most notably , water intrusion . In 2005 , the university filed a lawsuit against a contractor , for which it was compensated $ 13 @.@ 3 million in an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement . Amid these concerns , on September 2010 , the CSU Board of Trustees approved a proposal to have the building razed . 
 Hideo Sasaki 's architectural firm Sasaki Associates , Inc. found in the February 2010 master plan that the campus 's seismic risk , uneven terrain , lack of parking spaces , small classrooms , and pedestrian @-@ unfriendly roads are major constraints for future campus development . It also indicated the lack of identity , an undefined sense of arrival , and a desire to build a stronger on @-@ campus community , among others , as recurrent themes among campus 's users .

 = = Academics = = 
 Cal Poly Pomona 's academic offerings have evolved throughout the years . Prior to the ownership shift to Cal Poly SLO in 1938 , the Voorhis School for Boys in San Dimas had been providing educational offerings in " music , bookkeeping , agriculture , library work , carpentry , nature study , machine shop , and printing " coupled with Christian religious fundamentals to an all @-@ male student body with poor , underage boys . In 1938 , the campus became the agricultural branch of Cal Poly SLO when a small staff was transfer from San Luis Obispo along with group of agricultural inspection students . Thus , Cal Poly at Pomona ( then just Cal Poly ) began offering Associate 's degrees in 1938 and Bachelor 's degrees in 1940 when , despite legislative opposition from pro @-@ University of California members in Sacramento , president Julian McPhee asked allied members Armistead B. Carter and Daniel C. Murphy to introduce the bill when two opposing members were not present to vote . Following the governance breakup with the San Luis Obispo in 1966 , and as outlined by the 1960 California Master Plan for Higher Education , Cal Poly continued " offer [ ing ] undergraduate and graduate instruction through the master 's degree in the liberal arts and sciences and professional education , including teacher education . " Currently , Cal Poly promotes a " learn by doing " philosophy , where an essential part of the curriculum is hands @-@ on application of knowledge . 
 Merriam @-@ Webster mentions that " polytechnic " is a word first used in 1801 derived from the French <unk> which contains the Greek @-@ roots " poly " ( English : many ) and " <unk> " ( art ) .

Having not scored since , he received abuse from some sections of the York support during the 6 – 0 home victory over Rushall Olympic in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round on 27 October 2007 . Following this , manager Billy McEwan said " I was disappointed to hear the young players like Richard Brodie getting stick . How can we develop young players if we don 't support them ?

Following the match , Foyle commented on their partnership , saying " They are doing well together because Michael leads the line very well and Richard looks to hit the flanks . " After receiving a yellow card in a home match with Oxford on 17 October 2009 for kicking the ball away , which was his fifth booking of the season , he was handed a one @-@ match suspension for York 's match against Luton Town . York claimed the booking was the result of mistaken identity , as Adam Smith was the player who committed the offence , and an appeal with The Football Association was lodged .

 On 16 May 2011 , Brodie signed for Conference Premier club Fleetwood Town on loan for 2011 – 12 for a five @-@ figure loan fee . <unk> was cited as the reason for the transfer , with manager Evans saying " Richard is a very talented lad but it is no secret he has failed to settle away from his family home " . Brodie debuted as a 54th @-@ minute substitute for Magno Vieira in Fleetwood 's 2 – 0 away win over Grimsby on 13 August 2011 . His first goal for Fleetwood was the team 's fifth goal in a 5 – 2 home victory over Kidderminster on 20 September 2011 . Brodie 's fifth league goal for Fleetwood came on 26 December 2011 against Southport , when he scored a late equaliser in the 88th minute to make the score 2 – 2 in front of 3 @,@ 029 supporters , a record home league attendance for Fleetwood . He scored twice during the away league match against the same club on 1 January 2012 , the first coming after just four minutes and the second coming in the 29th minute , which made the score 3 – 0 to Fleetwood . Two minutes after scoring his second goal Brodie was sent off after receiving a second yellow card , although his team went on to win the match 6 – 0 . He made 39 appearances and scored 10 goals in 2011 – 12 and won his second Conference Premier winner 's medal in as many seasons , as Fleetwood won the title and therefore promotion into League Two . 
 Brodie joined League Two club Morecambe on 19 July 2012 on a six @-@ month loan deal . He made his debut in Morecambe 's 2012 – 13 opener as a 54th @-@ minute substitute for Jordan Burrow in their 2 – 1 away victory over Championship team Blackpool on 12 August 2012 in the League Cup first round . His first start came on 18 August 2012 in Morecambe 's 3 – 0 win away to Exeter City on 18 August 2012 . Having scored six goals in 27 appearances , he returned to Crawley on 2 January 2013 as Morecambe were not in a financial position to extend his loan . On 4 January 2013 , Brodie joined Conference Premier team Grimsby Town on loan until the end of 2012 – 13 . He made his debut the following day , starting Grimsby 's 1 – 1 home draw with Hereford United , before scoring his first goal in a 4 – 2 win at home to Alfreton Town on 2 February 2013 . Brodie was released from his loan spell on 25 March 2013 , the day after he missed a penalty in the 4 – 1 penalty shoot @-@ out defeat against Wrexham in the 2013 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium . He had scored two goals in 15 appearances for Grimsby .

 Brodie was released by Crawley at the end of the season and went on trial with Hartlepool United , who were newly relegated into League Two . He instead signed for Conference Premier club Gateshead on 15 May 2013 on a one @-@ year contract . He scored on his debut away to Kidderminster on 10 August 2013 , although Gateshead went on to lose 3 – 1 . After scoring twice in his first seven appearances for Gateshead , Brodie signed for their Conference Premier rivals Hereford United on a one @-@ month loan on 13 September 2013 , being reunited with former York manager Foyle . He made his debut later that day in Hereford 's 2 – 0 home defeat to Aldershot Town , and scored his only goal for the club in a 1 – 1 draw away to FC Halifax Town on 21 September 2013 . He returned to Gateshead after the loan expired , having made eight appearances and scored one goal for Hereford .

 Brodie was loaned out again on 21 November 2013 , joining fellow Conference Premier club Southport initially until January 2014 . He made his Southport debut two days later in a 5 – 1 defeat away to Aldershot and scored his first goal on 28 December 2013 in a 2 – 1 away loss against Alfreton . On 3 January 2014 , Brodie 's loan deal at Southport was extended until the end of the season . He completed the loan spell with one goal from 18 appearances as Southport finished 18th in the Conference Premier . At the end of the season , Brodie was released by Gateshead in May 2014 . 
 Brodie joined Southport permanently on 18 June 2014 , being signed by his former York and Hereford manager Foyle . His first appearance after signing permanently came as a 62nd @-@ minute substitute for Scott Kay in a 0 – 0 away draw with Torquay United on 16 August 2014 , before starting the following match , a 2 – 1 home win over Altrincham a week later , scoring Southport 's first goal after reacting first to a John Marsden header that had hit the post . Brodie was Southport 's top scorer in 2014 – 15 with 14 goals from 41 appearances as Southport finished 19th in the Conference Premier . He signed a new contract with the club in May 2015 .

 = Zebra shark = 
 This species is sometimes called the leopard shark , a name otherwise used for Triakis semifasciata . 
 The zebra shark ( Stegostoma fasciatum ) is a species of carpet shark and the sole member of the family <unk> . It is found throughout the tropical Indo @-@ Pacific , frequenting coral reefs and sandy flats to a depth of 62 m ( 203 ft ) . Adult zebra sharks are distinctive in appearance , with five longitudinal ridges on a cylindrical body , a low caudal fin comprising nearly half the total length , and a pattern of dark spots on a pale background . Young zebra sharks under 50 – 90 cm ( 20 – 35 in ) long have a completely different pattern , consisting of light vertical stripes on a brown background , and lack the ridges . This species attains a length of 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) . 
 Zebra sharks are nocturnal and spend most of the day resting motionless on the sea floor . At night , they actively hunt for molluscs , crustaceans , small bony fishes , and possibly sea snakes inside holes and crevices in the reef . Though solitary for most of the year , they form large seasonal aggregations . The zebra shark is oviparous : females produce several dozen large egg capsules , which they anchor to underwater structures via adhesive tendrils . <unk> to humans and hardy in captivity , zebra sharks are popular subjects of ecotourism dives and public aquaria . The World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Vulnerable worldwide , as it is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range ( except off Australia ) for meat , fins , and liver oil . There is evidence that its numbers are dwindling . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The zebra shark was first described as Squalus varius by Seba in 1758 . No type specimen was designated , though Seba included a comprehensive description in Latin and an accurate illustration of a juvenile . Müller and Henle placed this species in the genus Stegostoma in 1837 , using the specific epithet fasciatus ( or the neuter form fasciatum , as Stegostoma is neuter while Squalus is masculine ) from an 1801 work by Bloch and Schneider . In 1984 , Compagno rejected the name " varius / m " in favor of " fasciatus / m " for the zebra shark , because Seba did not consistently use binomial nomenclature in his species descriptions ( though Squalus varius is one that can be construed as a binomial name ) . In Compagno 's view , the first proper usage of " varius / m " was by Garman in 1913 , making it a junior synonym . Both S. fasciatum and S. <unk> are currently in wide usage for this species . 
 The genus name is derived from the Greek <unk> meaning " covered " , and stoma meaning " mouth " . The specific epithet fasciatum means " banded " , referring to the striped pattern of the juvenile . The juvenile coloration is also the origin of the common name " zebra shark " . The name " leopard shark " is sometimes applied to the spotted adult , but that name usually refers to the houndshark Triakis semifasciata , and is also sometimes used for the tiger shark ( Galeocerdo cuvier ) . Due to their different color patterns and body proportions , both juveniles and subadults have historically been described as separate species ( Squalus tigrinus and S. longicaudatus respectively ) . 
 = = Phylogeny = = 
 There is robust morphological support for the placement of the zebra shark , the whale shark ( Rhincodon typus ) , and the nurse sharks ( Ginglymostoma <unk> , Nebrius ferrugineus , and Pseudoginglymostoma <unk> ) in a single clade . However , the interrelationships between these taxa are disputed by various authors . <unk> ( 1986 ) suggested that the whale shark is the closest relative of the zebra shark , and proposed a single family encompassing all five species in the clade . Compagno ( 1988 ) suggested affinity between this species and either Pseudoginglymostoma or a clade containing Rhincodon , Ginglymostoma , and Nebrius . Goto ( 2001 ) placed the zebra shark as the sister group to a clade containing Rhincodon and Ginglymostoma . 
 = = Description = = 
 The zebra shark has a cylindrical body with a large , slightly flattened head and a short , blunt snout . The eyes are small and placed on the sides of the head ; the spiracles are located behind them and are as large or larger . The last 3 of the 5 short gill slits are situated over the pectoral fin bases , and the fourth and fifth slits are much closer together than the others . Each nostril has a short barbel and a groove running from it to the mouth . The mouth is nearly straight , with three lobes on the lower lip and furrows at the corners . There are 28 – 33 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 22 – 32 tooth rows in the lower jaw ; each tooth has a large central cusp flanked by two smaller ones . 
 There are five distinctive ridges running along the body in adults , one along the dorsal midline and two on the sides . The dorsal midline ridge merges into the first dorsal fin , placed about halfway along the body and twice the size of the second dorsal fin . The pectoral fins are large and broad ; the pelvic and anal fins are much smaller but larger than the second dorsal fin . The caudal fin is almost as long as the rest of the body , with a barely developed lower lobe and a strong ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe . The zebra shark attains a length of 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) , with an unsubstantiated record of 3 @.@ 5 m ( 11 ft ) . Males and females are not dimorphic in size . 
 The color pattern in young sharks is dark brown above and light yellow below , with vertical yellow stripes and spots . As the shark grows to 50 – 90 cm ( 20 – 35 in ) long , the dark areas begin to break up , changing the general pattern from light @-@ on @-@ dark stripes to dark @-@ on @-@ light spots . There is substantial variation in pattern amongst adults , which can be used to identify particular individuals . In 1964 , a partially albino zebra shark completely lacking spots was discovered in the Indian Ocean . The shark , a 1 @.@ 9 m ( 6 @.@ 2 ft ) long mature female , was unusual in that albino animals rarely survive long in the wild due to their lack of crypsis . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The zebra shark occurs in the tropical waters of the Indo @-@ Pacific region , from South Africa to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf ( including Madagascar and the Maldives ) , to India and Southeast Asia ( including Indonesia , the Philippines , and Palau ) , northward to Taiwan and Japan , eastward to New Caledonia and Tonga , and southward to northern Australia . 
 Bottom @-@ dwelling in nature , the zebra shark is found from the intertidal zone to a depth of 62 m ( 203 ft ) over the continental and insular shelves . Adults and large juveniles frequent coral reefs , rubble , and sandy areas . There are unsubstantiated reports of this species from fresh water in the Philippines . Zebra sharks sometimes cross oceanic waters to reach isolated seamounts . Movements of up to 140 km ( 87 mi ) have been recorded for individual sharks . However , genetic data indicates that there is little exchange between populations of zebra sharks , even if their ranges are contiguous . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 During the day , zebra sharks are sluggish and usually found resting on the sea bottom , sometimes using their pectoral fins to prop up the front part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration . Reef channels are favored resting spots , since the tightened space yields faster , more oxygenated water . They become more active at night or when food becomes available . Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers , propelling themselves with pronounced <unk> ( eel @-@ like ) undulations of the body and tail . In a steady current , they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails . 
 The zebra shark feeds primarily on shelled molluscs , though it also takes crustaceans , small bony fishes , and possibly sea snakes . The slender , flexible body of this shark allows it to wriggle into narrow holes and crevices in search of food , while its small mouth and thickly muscled buccal cavity allow it to create a powerful suction force with which to extract prey . This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and marine mammals . Known parasites of the zebra shark include four species of tapeworms in the genus <unk> . 
 = = = Sociality = = = 
 Zebra sharks are usually solitary , though aggregations of 20 – 50 individuals have been recorded . Off southeast Queensland , aggregations of several hundred zebra sharks form every summer in shallow water . These aggregations consist entirely of large adults , with females outnumbering males by almost three to one . The purpose of these aggregations is yet unclear ; no definite mating behavior has been observed between the sharks . There is an observation of an adult male zebra shark biting the pectoral fin of another adult male and pushing him against the sea floor ; the second male was turned on his back , and remained motionless for several minutes . This behavior resembles pre @-@ copulatory behaviors between male and female sharks , and in both cases the biting and holding of the pectoral fin has been speculated to relate to one shark asserting dominance over the other . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 The courtship behavior of the zebra shark consists of the male following the female and biting vigorously at her pectoral fins and tail , with periods in which he holds onto her pectoral fin and both sharks lie still on the bottom . On occasion this leads to mating , in which the male curls his body around the female and inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca . Copulation lasts for two to five minutes . The zebra shark is oviparous , with females laying large egg capsules measuring 17 cm ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) long , 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) wide , and 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . The egg case is dark brown to purple in color , and has hair @-@ like fibers along the sides that secure it to the substrate . The adhesive fibers emerge first from the female 's vent ; the female circles vertical structures such as reef outcroppings to entangle the fibers , so as to anchor the eggs . Females have been documented laying up to 46 eggs over a 112 @-@ day period . Eggs are deposited in batches of around four . Reproductive seasonality in the wild is unknown . 
 In captivity , the eggs hatch after four to six months , depending on temperature . The hatchlings measure 20 – 36 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 – 14 @.@ 2 in ) long and have proportionately longer tails than adults . The habitat preferences of juveniles are unclear ; one report places them at depths greater than 50 m ( 160 ft ) , while another report from India suggests they inhabit shallower water than adults . The stripes of the juveniles may have an anti @-@ predator function , making each individual in a group harder to target . Males attain sexual maturity at 1 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 8 m ( 4 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 9 ft ) long , and females at 1 @.@ 7 m ( 5 @.@ 6 ft ) long . The lifespan has been estimated to be 25 – 30 years in the wild . There is a single report of a female producing young asexually . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Docile and slow @-@ moving , zebra sharks are not dangerous to humans and can be easily approached underwater . However , they have bitten divers who pull on their tails or attempt to ride them . As of 2008 there is one record of an unprovoked attack in the International Shark Attack File , though no injuries resulted . They are popular attractions for ecotourist divers in the Red Sea , off the Maldives , off Thailand 's Phuket and Phi Phi islands , on the Great Barrier Reef , and elsewhere . Many zebra sharks at diving sites have become accustomed to the presence of humans , taking food from divers ' hands and allowing themselves to be touched . The zebra shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed by a number of public aquaria around the world . The small , attractively colored young also find their way into the hands of private hobbyists , though this species grows far too large for the home aquarium . 
 The zebra shark is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range , using bottom trawls , gillnets , and longlines . The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption . Furthermore , the liver oil is used for vitamins , the fins for shark fin soup , and the offal for fishmeal . Zebra sharks are highly susceptible to localized depletion due to their shallow habitat and low levels of dispersal between populations , and market surveys suggest that they are much less common now than in the past . They are also threatened by the degradation of their coral reef habitat by human development , and by destructive fishing practices such as dynamiting or poisoning . As a result , the World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Vulnerable . Off Australia , the only threat to this species is a very low level of bycatch in prawn trawls , and there it has been assessed as of Least Concern .
