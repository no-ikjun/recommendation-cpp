 Housed in the Michigan Union , the Central Student Government ( CSG ) is the central student government of the University . With representatives from each of the University 's colleges and schools , CSG represents students and manages student funds on the campus . CSG is a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organization , independent from the University of Michigan . In recent years CSG has organized <unk> , a transportation service between campus and the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport , and has led the university 's efforts to register its student population to vote , with its Voice Your Vote Commission ( VYV ) registering 10 @,@ 000 students in 2004 . VYV also works to improve access to non @-@ partisan voting @-@ related information and increase student voter turnout . CSG was successful at reviving Homecoming activities , including a carnival and parade , for students after a roughly eleven @-@ year absence in October 2007 , and during the 2013 @-@ 14 school year , was instrumental in persuading the University to rescind an unpopular change in student football seating policy at Michigan Stadium . 
 There are student governance bodies in each college and school . The two largest colleges at the University of Michigan are the College of Literature , Science , and the Arts ( LS & A ) and the College of Engineering . Undergraduate students in the LS & A are represented by the LS & A Student Government ( LSA SG ) . Engineering Student Government ( ESG ) manages undergraduate student government affairs for the College of Engineering . Graduate students enrolled in the Rackham Graduate School are represented by the Rackham Student Government ( <unk> ) . In addition , the students that live in the residence halls are represented by the University of Michigan Residence Halls Association ( RHA ) . 
 A longstanding goal of the student government is to create a student @-@ designated seat on the Board of Regents , the university 's governing body . Such a designation would achieve parity with other Big Ten schools that have student regents . In 2000 , students Nick <unk> and Scott Trudeau ran for the board on the statewide ballot as third @-@ party nominees . <unk> ran for a second time in 2002 , along with Matt <unk> and Susan Fawcett . Although none of these campaigns has been successful , a poll conducted by the State of Michigan in 1998 concluded that a majority of Michigan voters would approve of such a position if the measure were put before them . A change to the board 's makeup would require amending the Michigan Constitution .

 = = = School songs = = = 
 The University of Michigan 's fight song , " The Victors , " was written by student Louis <unk> in 1898 following the last @-@ minute football victory over the University of Chicago that won a league championship . The song was declared by John Philip Sousa as " the greatest college fight song ever written . " The song refers to the university as being " the Champions of the West . " At the time , U @-@ M was part of the Western Conference , which would later become the Big Ten Conference . Michigan was considered to be on the Western Frontier when it was founded in the old Northwest Territory . Although mainly used at sporting events , the fight song can be heard at other events . President Gerald Ford had it played by the United States Marine Band as his entrance anthem during his term as president from 1974 to 1977 , in preference over the more traditional " Hail to the Chief " , and the Michigan Marching Band performed a slow @-@ tempo variation on the fight song at his funeral . The fight song is also sung during graduation commencement ceremonies . The university 's alma mater song is " The Yellow and Blue . " A common rally cry is " Let 's Go Blue ! , " which had a complementary short musical arrangement written by former students Joseph Carl , a <unk> , and Albert <unk> , a drum major . 
 Before " The Victors " was officially the University 's fight song , the song " There 'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight " was considered to be the school song . After Michigan temporarily withdrew from the Western Conference in 1907 , a new Michigan fight song " Varsity " was written in 1911 because the line " champions of the West " was no longer appropriate .

 Dragon kill points or DKP are a semi @-@ formal score @-@ keeping system ( loot system ) used by guilds in massively multiplayer online games . Players in these games are faced with large scale challenges , or raids , which may only be surmounted through the concerted effort of dozens of players at a time . While many players may be involved in defeating a boss , the boss will reward the group with only a small number of items desired by the players . Faced with this scarcity , some system of fairly distributing the items must be established . Used originally in the massively multiplayer online role @-@ playing game EverQuest , dragon kill points are points that are awarded to players for defeating bosses and redeemed for items that those bosses would ' drop ' . At the time most of the bosses faced by the players were dragons , hence the name . 
 While not transferable outside of a particular guild , DKP are often treated in a manner similar to currency by guilds . They are paid out at a specified rate and redeemed in modified first or second price auctions , although these are not the only methods by which DKP may be redeemed or awarded . However , Dragon kill points are distinct from the virtual currencies in each game world which are designed by the game developers — DKP systems vary from guild to guild and the points themselves only have value in regards to the dispersal of boss ' loot ' . 
 = = Origin and motivation = = 
 DKP systems were first designed for Everquest in 1999 by <unk> as part of the creation of a guild called " Afterlife " and named for two dragons , Lady Vox and Lord <unk> . Since then , it has been adapted for use in other similar online games , in World of Warcraft for example an Avatar named <unk> started its popular use and other programmers designed applications so that the system could work in game as an application to track data for achievements made . Unlike pen and paper or more traditional role @-@ playing video games , massively multiplayer online games could present challenges so significant that the number of players required to defeat them would greatly exceed the number of items awarded to the raid following the boss kill — a raid of 25 individuals may only see two or three items ' drop ' . The actual number of players required to defeat a specific boss varies from game to game , but the person @-@ hours invested are non @-@ trivial . Raid encounters may involve " 10 @-@ 200 players organized to achieve a common goal over a period of typically around 3 @-@ 6 continuous hours " and demand teamwork and competence from all raid members . 
 As the number of players required to defeat a boss grows , so does the problem of distributing the rewards from such efforts . Since these items appear , or " drop " , in quantities much smaller than the total number of players in the group required to defeat them , a means of deciding which of the players should receive the items is necessary . At the " endgame " , new items rewarded from boss kills represent one of the only means to continue to enhance the combat effectiveness of the character or the social standing of the player . As such , individual players care about receiving a fair shot at dropped items . Guilds facing smaller challenges with fewer players typically begin by allotting items through a simulated roll of the dice ( provided by the software serving the game itself ) , similar to dice rolls used to dictate the outcome of contingent events in pen and paper role @-@ playing games . As the number of players expands , rolls may be weighted by seniority within the guild or adjusted by some other measure so as to ensure that veterans of the guild do not lose out on an item to a new member . Games and dungeons which require larger groups of players may create the incentive for more formal DKP systems . Methods to reward items according to seniority or performance developed out of these modifications , including systems relying on a formal allotment of points per kill . 
 = = Mechanics of a DKP system = = 
 The basic concepts of most DKP systems are simple . Players are given points for participating in raids or other guild events and spend those points on the item of their choice when the boss ' drops ' the item . A player who does not get a chance to spend their DKP accumulates it between raids and is able to spend it in the future . These points , while earned and spent like currency , are not the same thing as the virtual currency provided by the game company for the virtual world . The points themselves represent only the social contract that guilds extend to players . Should that player leave the guild or the guild disband , those points become valueless . These measures vary considerably in usage . Some guilds eschew formalized ' loot ' systems completely , allowing guild leaders to direct which players receive items from bosses . Some use complex measures to determine item price while others use an auction system to allocate goods via bidding . A few common variations are described below . 
 = = = Zero @-@ sum DKP = = = 
 Zero @-@ sum DKP systems are designed to ensure the net change in points among the raid is zero for each item dropped , as the name might suggest . When the item drops , each player who is interested in it indicates as much to a guild leader . The player who has the highest DKP total receives the item for its specified price and the same number of points are divided evenly among the rest of the raid and given out , resulting in no net change to the raid total . As a result , the raid would only be rewarded DKP if at least one player desired the item dropped by the boss . Since over time guilds will revisit the same boss multiple times , some zero @-@ sum DKP systems are modified to introduce a " dummy " character which may be awarded DKP for the boss ' kill ' even though no player in the guild received an item . This is purely an accounting measure and allows the guild to reward players for defeating a boss if they are using an automated point tracking system . 
 = = = Simple DKP = = = 
 The simplest DKP variation is one where every item has a set price list and each player earns some specified number of DKP each time they participate in a guild raid . Like zero @-@ sum systems , the player with the most points recorded actually received the item , paying the specified price . Unlike zero @-@ sum , a simple DKP system does not compensate the rest of the raid based in the value of the items received . 
 = = = Auction systems = = = 
 Setting " prices " in DKP for specific items can be difficult , as analysis of a particular item can be subjective and laborious . In order to avoid this quandary , guilds may establish an auction system for items . Points are awarded to the player at some specified rate and when the items are awarded to the raid group , players bid DKP for the item of their choice . Auctions may be conducted in an open ascending fashion or through sealed bids over private messages to guild leaders . While this process results in relatively efficient allocation of items to players willing to part with DKP , it presents the social consequence that perceived selfish bidding could result in an item being awarded to a character who would not make the best use of it . 
 = = = GDKP ( Gold DKP ) = = = 
 Gold DKP ( GDKP ) is a system developed for pick up groups ( <unk> ) . This system was introduced to support individuals without a guild to support raids for difficult bosses / zones . In GDKP , when a boss is killed , each item dropped is put up for auction with a low value . Each item is then auctioned . The eventual winner pays the loot master , and after every item has been auctioned off , every participant in the group is rewarded an equal share of gold . For example if 20 members were in the group , and 500 gold was spent on items , each raid participant would receive 25 gold . 
 = = DKP as virtual capital = = 
 Since the intention of DKP is to allocate scarce resources amongst guild members , they can be understood in the context of virtual capital . Players " earn " and " spend " DKP , bidding in a system of auctions for an item which holds some value for them . DKP are referred to as " currency " a guild leader pays his " employees " . Despite these analogies , DKP remain a kind of " private money system " , allowing guilds to mete out these otherwise unachievable items in return for participation and discipline . The points cannot be traded or redeemed outside the guild and are not actually part of the game itself ; they are tracked on external websites . In contrast , the virtual currencies created by game developers are part of the game software and may be traded between players without respect to any social affiliation . Just as DKP is valueless outside the guild , parlaying of economic capital for DKP ( paying real world currency in exchange for DKP ) is almost unheard of . Because guilds mete out DKP in return for participation in events the functional result is that DKP serve less as currency or material capital and more as what <unk> Mortensen refers to as a " social stabilizer " ; players who attend raids more frequently or play by the rules reap the rewards while more " casual " gamers do not . This provides an incentive for players to remain in the social system ( the guild ) longer than they might otherwise . 
 Within the guild , DKP may stand in for competence — high level items ( Krista @-@ Lee Malone mentions a specific item from World of Warcraft , the " Cold Snap " wand ) are forms of cultural capital themselves . Since the items are " bound " to the player who first receives them , the only way to wield a desired item is to be involved in the raid that defeated the boss which rewards it . As such , a " Cold Snap " represents a signal to other players that the bearer has defeated a particular high @-@ level monster and therefore mastered the skills needed to do so . The points themselves represent a mélange of cultural and material capital . The language of material capital is used : " price " , " bid " , and " currency " , but these terms belie a unit of account that " crosses the line between material and symbolic " . 
 = Karas ( anime ) = 
 Karas ( Japanese : <unk> － <unk> － , Hepburn : Karasu , lit . The Crow ) is a six @-@ part original video animation . Tatsunoko Production produced it to commemorate its 40th anniversary of anime production . Each Karas episode was first televised in Japan as a pay @-@ per @-@ view program from March 25 , 2005 , to August 3 , 2007 , before being released onto DVDs . Manga Entertainment compiled and released these episodes as two feature length , direct @-@ to @-@ DVD films for the English market . 
 Karas tells the story of Otoha , a former yakuza , living in a fictional version of Shinjuku , Tokyo populated by humans and yōkai ( Japanese spirits ) . He is one of the titular karas , humans appointed as superpowered agents of the land . Able to transform into a car , an aircraft , and an armored crusader ; the skilled swordsman is to stop his corrupt predecessor , Eko , from taking over Tokyo . Supporting characters such as Eko 's former henchman , Nue ; the yōkai ; and Homura , the karas of another city , help Otoha in his quest . A concurrent side story focuses on humans affected by Eko 's scheme . 
 Karas won the Best Original Video at the 2006 Tokyo Anime Award competition , and most reviewers were impressed with the images produced by fusing 2D and 3D art techniques . The story presents themes on the conflicts between cultural traditions and modern society , and the relationship between people . Reviewers , however , found its presentation was too confusing to follow ; several of them felt it worsened the show by detracting from the strength of its art . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Ibira initially pictured Karas as a horror story with a vengeance theme . It had a simple plot similar to the manga , <unk> . The protagonist karas is on a quest , slaughtering mikuras to recover the body parts of his murdered lover . Until he recovers all the parts , he assembles them into a katana to kill the mikuras . The final version of Karas was more of a superhero action story , and originally intended for three leading heroes in the same vein as the Japanese period drama , <unk> ga <unk> ! . The characters Otoha , Nue , and the human detective Kure were the leads but the final version primarily focused on Otoha . The presentation of Karas differs in several ways from typical anime . The show maintains a serious tone and never indulges in slapstick , exaggerated facial expressions , or super deformed characters . It avoids heavy expositions . Dialogue tends to be short and viewers have to infer what is going on based on very little presented information . The team had left out substantial amounts of information from the show , printing them in a booklet of the final DVD package . 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 Karas is set in a fictional version of Shinjuku , Tokyo . The show initially showcased larger areas of Tokyo , but the production team felt other animations have featured these areas too many times . Art designer , Hajime Satō created a modern version of the ward infused with a mixture of East Asian cultures . Fictional lettering , resembling Chinese and Hangul characters , fill the billboards and signs . Western gargoyles and Singapore 's Merlion statues decorate the streets , and the buildings are modeled on Shinjuku structures of 2003 while blending influences from the Shōwa period . This Shinjuku is populated by humans and Japanese folklore spirits , yōkai . The humans have become indifferent to the yōkai 's presence , and fail to see them as they go about their lives . 
 The production team envisioned Japanese cities as entities , who require physical agents to execute their will and regulate the activities within them . The concept behind the health of a city is based on traditional Chinese medicine in which the smooth flow of a body 's fluids nourishes its internal organs . The team equates yōkai with qi , humans with water , and agents of the city ( karas ) with blood . They integrated Celtic mythology into their concept for further <unk> , treating the city as the male ( yang ) ; and Yurine ( <unk> ) , the manifestation of its will as female ( yin ) . In contrast , their theory treats the humans and agents as the children of the city and its will , and classifies them as the reproduction system 's five major organs . Following the team 's vision , the mikuras ( evil yōkai ) represent the five elements in this system . This idea forms the basis of the relationship between cities and their inhabitants in the show . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 The main plot centers around the confrontation between Otoha and Eko . After a cold open that announces Eko 's plan to remake Tokyo , the story moves ahead three years . Nue arrives in Shinjuku to free his brother from Eko 's hold , while Otoha is in a hospital from heavy injuries . The early parts of the show proceed in a " mikura of the week " fashion as Otoha ( as a karas ) and Nue separately fight against Eko 's minions . When the mikuras attack hospitals across the ward to locate Otoha 's body , Otoha and Nue work together but when they separate Otoha 's Yurine is <unk> and he is deprived from the power to turn into a karas . Nue then goes to Eko 's base , where Eko kills Yurine and reveals capturing Nue completes the final part of his plan . Meanwhile , Otoha gets into a yakuza fight only to be rescued by Homura , another city 's karas . When Eko launches the last stage of his plan and ravages Tokyo with metal tentacles , Otoha ends up among human refugees in a shelter the chief of police had commissioned . 
 A side story takes place within the main plot , focusing on the humans affected by the ongoing events . Sagisaka Minoru and Narumi Kure are detectives in Shinjuku 's Intervention Department who investigate serial murders for supernatural evidence . <unk> kill and suck the blood of these victims to replenish their strength , but no one except Sagisaka seriously believes in supernatural involvement . Sagisaka is bent on vindicating his daughter , Yoshiko who has been committed to a psychiatric hospital for claiming a mikura committed the mass murder she had survived . Sagisaka 's and Kure 's investigation brings them to the survivor of another attack , Hinaru ( <unk> ) . Director Sato had created her to represent the best qualities of rural migrants looking for better opportunities in the big cities . When Eko starts the last part of his plan ; Kure , Hinaru , and the Sagisaka arrive in the shelter Otoha is in . 
 The chief of police reveals himself as Ushi @-@ oni and starts eating the humans trapped in the shelter . Sagisaka sacrifices himself to push his daughter away from Ushi @-@ oni 's attack . Otoha confronts and , in a climatic sequence , his conviction resurrects his Yurine , which restores Otoha as a karas and he slays Ushi @-@ oni . While karas from other cities observe the showdown between Otoha and Eko , Homura steps in to help Otoha . Otoha carries out Nue 's request to kill him and his brother , depriving Eko of his new power source and stopping his entire scheme . Confronting the depowered Eko on equal terms , Otoha finally defeats him . Eko claims Otoha will understand his reasons after 400 years as a karas . Despite defending his human body and Yurine from soldiers ordered by the Deputy Governor to shoot them , Otoha proclaims himself as Tokyo 's appointed agent , who will protect all its inhabitants . While Hinaru stays behind in Shinjuku as it is being rebuilt , Kure and Yoshiko have had enough and leave for the countryside . 
 In a post @-@ credits scene , Eko 's boot is found by an unknown character . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The production team intended Karas to be more than a mere <unk> ( transforming ) hero . Unlike the vengeful protagonist in Mazinger Z , the hero of Karas embodies the spirit of the city , and acts for the city 's interest instead of his own . Screenwriter Shin Yoshida sets up a dualism of this idea in the form of two Karas characters ; one who believes events are leading to a revolution , and the other viewing them as simply the passing of an era . Manga Entertainment also promoted the hero in Karas as " a cross between a cyberpunk version of the Crow and Batman " . 
 Karas is the title for the city 's appointed agents . Capable of transforming into automobiles and aircraft , they are suits of armor animated by human souls infused into them through Yurine 's chanting of a Shinto prayer . Director Sato told his animators to enhance the Karas ' dark nature by drawing their faces in shadows . Fight scenes involving Karas take place mostly in dark settings shrouded with steam or lit with spotlights . Animators touched up film frames by hand , creating an effect different from cel @-@ shaded animation . To make the Karas more menacing , they highlighted the eyes as if light bulbs were shining through them , a technique inspired by the <unk> practice of using light bulbs for the eyes of costumes . Producer Takaya Ibira explained the presence of ravens in Tokyo and the Tower of London , inspired him and Sato to model the agents of the city after them . He stated ravens are believed to be omens of good and bad in superstitions , and they always seem to be watching over the cities . This resonated with his view of the raven in the story Noah 's Ark , which cursed Noah as it scouted for land . The presence of ravens all over Tokyo led Ibira to notice the same of cats and conceive the <unk> as <unk> . 
 Otoha Yosuke ( <unk> <unk> , Otoha Yosuke ) is the protagonist of Karas . Yoshida wrote out Otoha Yosuke as a character dark in history and actions , breaking the traditional mold of a Japanese hero . He based his idea on his observation of Shinjuku , questioning what sort of a hero a ward exuding an aura of terror and happiness would produce . He portrayed Otoha as the product of incest between his mother and his brother who is the local yakuza boss . Otoha 's back @-@ story states him as suffering from congenital insensitivity to pain which lends the character a merciless reputation as his brother 's enforcer . The initial concept of Otoha was much darker , casting him as a serial killer who hunts down mikuras to retrieve his lover 's body parts . This was the first project that <unk> Wada ( <unk> <unk> , Wada <unk> ) worked on . 
 The main antagonist to Otoha is Eko <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> 'in <unk> ) . His back @-@ story states he was the Karas of Tokyo since the Edo period . In events before the start of the show , Eko turned his back on his duties and started a plan to revitalize the city and its Yōkai . He attracted several yōkai to be his cybernetic followers and intended to subjugate the humans . An Oedipus complex forms the basis for his motive . He views Tokyo as a father figure , and his Yurine as a mother figure ; and aims to supplant the city 's role in this relationship . Eko was a nameless character in the initial draft and known as " Another Karas " with a different appearance , although his prosthetic left leg is retained for the final version . 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) are Yōkai who became Eko 's minions and replaced their bodies with machinery . Ibira and Sato chose them to be villains , linking the act of the Karas as agents of the city killing these folklore creatures to traditional Japanese exorcism . The chimera @-@ like Nue , however , is a tragic anti @-@ hero who learned of Eko 's plans and turned against him . Sato thought up the cybernetic angle to surprise the Japanese who perceive immaterial yōkai to lack physical threat . Creature designer Kenji Andō adapted the yōkai designs from artist Toriyama Sekien 's illustrated folklore books , <unk> <unk> <unk> . The few yōkai with prominent roles in the show underwent greater changes . Andō pictured mikuras as direct cybernetic versions of Toriyama 's portrayals , and made Suiko the Kappa and Nue look like robotic versions of their illustrated forms . Sato , however , was dissatisfied with two of Andō 's designs , and redesigned them based on the concept behind the yōkai instead of on their appearance . The ghostly head in a flaming wheel , <unk> became a heavily armed skull @-@ on @-@ wheels ; and the bull @-@ headed spider , Ushi @-@ oni became a big @-@ mouth , bug @-@ eye , hungry @-@ for @-@ humans predator . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The show explores the relationship between technology and cultural traditions by personifying traditions as yōkai and mikuras . Ibira thought this up from observing a dramatic drop in the number of yōkai folk tales as Japan undergoes modernization . Electrical and gas lighting made light of these tales born from fear of darkness . The production team explained yōkai represent the city 's culture and functions , and their strengths are inversely proportional to the level of technology of society . As society grows more advanced , the yōkai and the functions of the city they represent weaken . The mikuras symbolize the five elements of Taoism . They turned to technology and became cyborgs to regain the strength to support the city . When a mikura dies , the city suffers a heavy loss of function associated with the element it represents ; the water level of Tokyo fell after the death of Suiko the kappa ( water based mikura ) . This theme implies a vibrant city requires a healthy mix of technology and culture . 
 Another main theme is regarding the " yōkai 's choice " . As agents of the city , the two karas represent different paths for the good of the city . The yōkai have to make a choice to support one of them . By following Eko , the humans are enslaved , and the presence of the yōkai will be imposed on them . By standing behind Otoha , the yōkai accept their lot and continue trying to live with the humans . Using the yōkai @-@ human relationship as an analogy for human @-@ human interaction , the team suggested people should be open and make the move , instead of passively staying in the background hoping for results . Ibira applied this to decision making , saying when faced with difficult choices , one should make a decision instead of hoping for others to make it for them . 
 = = Production = = 
 Founded in 1962 , Tatsunoko Production celebrated their 40th year of animated film production by releasing Karas in 2005 , their first production being Space Ace in 1965 . Keiichi Sato joined the company as the project director after he pitched its concept of a life @-@ sized dark hero to the management . He researched production and direction techniques from kabuki , a form of traditional Japanese theater ; and Japanese staged sword fights as materials for the project . Choreographed sword fights rendered with 3D animation were rare at that time , and Sato felt this would help distinguish the show . The use of theatrical elements and movie shooting techniques in its presentation sets Karas apart from its contemporaries . Producer Kenji Nakamura felt the team 's lack of experience in this area pushed them to ignore their previous animation work experience and break free of restrictions influenced by traditional animation production . 
 The Japanese animation industry traditionally drew every film cel by hand . This is labor @-@ intensive and inefficient ; the cels are generally non @-@ reusable , and errors are difficult to correct . This method is called the 2D approach due to the conception of the source images in only two dimensions . The use of computers and graphics software introduced computer graphics ( CG ) into the industry . This reduced waste ; animators can reuse digital cels to correct errors and make changes . Increasing computer power spread the use of three @-@ dimensional graphics software to create 3D models and environments , and render them as 2D images . This 3D approach requires more resources to create the 3D models , but production teams can correct errors or remake film sequences much faster than the traditional 2D approach . The 2D @-@ 3D hybrid approach in Karas was due to budget and aesthetic concerns . The 2D approach allowed greater artistic details and creativity , and the 3D approach could save resources . Sato , however , disapproved the common notion of using the 3D approach for economic concern . He pushed the team to enhance image quality with detailed CG . He was also dissatisfied with computer lighting effects , and ordered the animators to draw them by hand . Due to the bright colors of the original cels , they darkened the images and concentrated on areas where shadows should be , leaving untouched the areas where light falls on . 
 In the typical CG approach , the duties of 2D and 3D artists are distinct . The 2D artists think up and sketch out the characters ' appearances ; the 3D artists create the models based on these concept sketches . For Karas , these artists worked together in these areas to create the imagery seen in the show . To encourage this and establish consistency between images based on 2D and 3D processes , the 2D drawings incorporate styles typically found in 3D models . Animators also touched up or enhanced by hand , sequences involving the models . Eko 's karas form was mainly a 3D model but his skirt was hand drawn . During later stages of editing , the team spaced hand drawn frames among 3D @-@ rendered frames to enhance the fusion of styles . The production did not use motion capture techniques . Animators drew out action scenes based on their feelings , inspirations , and observations . 3D and 2D animation and special effects director , Takashi Hashimoto explained companies typically reduce their animators ' workload by using CG for long shots and drawing only close @-@ ups by hand . The team working on Karas , however , drew silhouettes for long shots and created complicated CG for close @-@ ups . The 3D animators used 3D texture software , <unk> 3D , to refine textures for the mikura and karas models , creating seamless details on them . 
 CG director , Takayuki Chiba studied <unk> , a kabuki stagecraft technique using various props to surprise audiences and immerse them in the show . Chiba attempted to apply this technique with CG to reproduce a vividness associated with live actor productions . He aimed to produce a smooth 2D @-@ 3D product full of Japanese flavor , rather than something like a " Disney production " . The team scanned real objects and used them in the show . Rice seasoning powder and bird feed became the dust and rubble in scenes of collapsing structures . They also scanned Korean dried seaweed , <unk> for other scenes . The animation team drew frames interpolating the motion between key frames by hand , and digitally interpolated those frames to create slow motion sequences . Editing teams in the industry normally time stretch the sequence with repeated still frames to produce these shots . Ibira reflected that typical 30 @-@ minute anime episodes consist of approximately 300 key frames . The first episode of Karas , however , consisted of approximately 700 key frames . 
 Composer Yoshihiro Ike infused the music with the sorrow borne by the karas , and the atmosphere conveyed by the background . Ike obliged the team 's request for Japanese flavored music , and studied kabuki tunes accompanying actors as they strike their mie ( <unk> ) , a picturesque pose to establish their character . He planned to use <unk> ( Japanese drums ) to further enhance the music , but felt the show had taken on an international outlook and discarded the notion . He wanted his music to match the quality of the show , and refrained from composing them until he had watched the pre @-@ dubbed version of the first episode . He composed most of his music as he watched the pre @-@ dubbed episodes to synchronize their tempo and dynamics with the action in the show . He chose Prague Symphony Orchestra to perform the main theme because he felt the background of their city and its people suited the character of Karas . Other departments also took extraordinary measures in producing the show . The sound crew procured a Nissan Skyline GT @-@ R and recorded its engine noise for several runs . These were used for the tunnel chase scenes which involved a hand @-@ drawn 1972 – 77 Skyline . The editing team took the additional step of editing cels post @-@ voice recording to ensure lip movements were in synch with the voices . These extra work and the hybrid 2D @-@ 3D approach inflated the budget of the production to three times the usual amount spent on an original video animation .

 Karas impressed its reviewers with its animated imagery . Mania Entertainment affirmed its lush imagery are enough to hook viewers , and certain 2D @-@ 3D scenes matched photorealistic standards . They felt Karas could rival or beat live @-@ action films in the visual department . DVD Talk commented they saw evidence a lot of effort went into merging the 2D and 3D animations . They , however , felt setting the scenes in darkness and obscuring points of interest with smoke or other effects marred the high quality imagery . Anime News Network stated the richly detailed images ; fast moving action scenes ; and visual effects of collapsing buildings , explosions , and blood made Karas one of the best action animation . Reviewers praised the fight scenes between the CG generated karas and mikuras , declaring them realistic , tasteful and stunning . DVD Talk , however , complained the camera jerked and moved all over the place never showing fights cleanly . Mania stated the fights in the later half failed to match those in the first half in terms of beauty , intensity , and variety ; the overlaying of characters ' face onto their armored forms in the finale detracted from their viewing experience . 
 Ike 's music for Karas impressed reviewers . Anime News Network stated his long scores set the mood in the scenes with their tone , enhancing the reviewers ' watching experience . Prague Symphony Orchestra 's performance of the main theme impressed more reviewers who claimed it brought out the heroic essence of Karas with a sense of power and drama , and enhanced the impact of the quick and intense battles . 
 Karas , however , suffered the worst criticisms for its story . Many reviewers and even the voice actors could not follow its dialogue and presentation . Other reviewers felt the abstract presentation forced viewers who wanted to understand the story , to pay extreme attention to the scant details presented in the show . <unk> and DVD Verdict were more critical , stating the viewer should not have to resort to reading summaries on the packaging to make sense of a story populated with incoherent battles and characters hard to tell apart from . 
 The viewers ' confused reaction to their story based on the first half , disappointed and frustrated Sato and Ibira . Sato explained the first two episodes were to capture the viewers ' attention , and remaining episodes would reveal greater details of the story . Mania complained this franchising tactic is a poor excuse for initial episodes lacking substance . They said although the later half answered much of the questions raised in the first , it created unanswered questions of its own . IGN and DVD Talk felt the story was darker and flowed better in the later half than the first , but IGN felt the revelation of details came too late in the show . DVD Verdict felt the story was pointless . Despite the protagonist reaffirming himself as a protector of the city , his showdown with the antagonist reduced most of Shinjuku to ruins . Reviewers found if they stripped the plot to its basics , it is a shallow good @-@ versus @-@ evil story made complex by its presentation in the first half . They , however , appreciated the surprising deaths of certain characters whose sacrifice in vain rendered a poignant emotion at that point of story . 
 Reviewers felt part of the failings laid with the underdeveloped characters despite them being slightly different from usual anime stock characters . The story neither properly introduces them nor explains their backgrounds and motivations , making them hard to identify with . Eko 's menace only came by force and not by his personality or schemes , making him a weak villain . DVD Talk found it hard to piece together the relationship between the main characters , but acknowledged the later half addressed some of these issues by revealing the background of some characters . They felt the revelations fleshed out Otoha 's personality and motivation , helping viewers to sympathize and identify with the protagonist . 
 Overall , reviewers are mixed in their final assessment of Karas . Their common reaction is of a visually stunning show with a confusing story . DVD Talk commented the blending of traditional 2D drawings and 3D CG was interesting ; but with a lacking story , the product is a " triumph of style over substance " . In spite of the criticisms , Karas won Best Original Video at the 2006 Tokyo Anime Award competition , and was one of United States ' top 10 best selling anime titles in 2006 .

Since then , they have released three further albums on different labels , none of which have been received as commercially or critically well as their debut album . 
 Three out of the band 's original six members are deceased : D @-@ Roc died from lymphoma , Beatmaster V from leukemia and Mooseman in a drive @-@ by shooting .

 Ice @-@ T 's interest in heavy metal stemmed from sharing a room with his cousin Earl , who was a fan of rock music and only listened to the local rock stations . Ice @-@ T particularly enjoyed heavy metal , citing Edgar Winter , Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath as his favorite bands . Ice @-@ T attended Crenshaw High School , where a few classmates shared his interest in the genre , including musicians Ernie C , Mooseman , Beatmaster V and D @-@ Roc the Executioner . Ice @-@ T began a solo career as a rapper , and later decided to form Body Count with these friends . 
 Ice @-@ T co @-@ wrote the band 's music and lyrics with lead guitarist Ernie C , and took on the duties of lead vocalist , even though he felt that he did not have a great singing voice . The original line @-@ up consisted of Mooseman on bass , Beatmaster V on drums and D @-@ Roc on rhythm guitar .

 Ice @-@ T introduced the band at Lollapalooza in 1991 , devoting half of his set to his hip hop songs , and half to Body Count songs , increasing his appeal with both alternative music fans and middle @-@ class teenagers . Some considered the Body Count performances to be the highlight of the tour . The group made its first album appearance on Ice @-@ T 's 1991 solo album O.G. Original Gangster . The song , " Body Count " , was preceded by a spoken introduction in which Ice @-@ T responds to allegations that he had " sold out " by incorporating rock elements into his rap albums by pointing out that rock music originated with African @-@ American artists such as Chuck Berry , Bo Diddley and Little Richard , in addition to stating that " as far as I 'm concerned , music is music . I don 't look at it as rock , R & B , or all that kind of stuff . I just look at it as music . [ ... ] I do what I like and I happen to like rock ' n ' roll , and I feel sorry for anybody who only listens to one form of music . " 
 Body Count 's self @-@ titled debut album was released on Sire / Warner Bros. Records on March 31 , 1992 . On the strength of the album , Body Count toured internationally , developing a strong following . When the group performed in Milan , Italy , some of the punks in the crowd began spitting at Ernie C. Ice @-@ T attempted to calm the situation by telling the crowd not to spit , but the spitting continued . As the band prepared to play " Cop Killer " , Ice @-@ T identified an audience member who spit in his direction ; Ice @-@ T responded by rushing into the crowd and punching the <unk> . As the band began to play , some of the audience began fighting with Ice @-@ T. Body Count escaped the crowd mid @-@ song , and the promoter immediately shut the concert down . 
 Outside the venue , angry audience members trashed the band 's tour bus . The band hailed a taxicab , but its driver abandoned the cab when the mob surrounded the taxi , leading Body Count to steal the taxi in order to escape , abandoning it and their tour coats a mile away from the venue . They hailed another cab , and the driver attempted to take them back to the venue until the band screamed at the driver to take them to the hotel . The incident was the subject of much controversy and coverage on Italian television . The band appeared on a Milan radio station , where the disc jockey told his audience , " Some clowns tried to ruin his concert . We should be angry at them . Ice @-@ T is a guest in our country , we invited him to do all these sold @-@ out shows , and we love him ! " Several Italian fans apologized for the behavior of the Milan audience . 
 = = = Controversy over the song Cop Killer ( 1992 ) = = = 
 The song " Cop Killer " , intended to criticize corrupt police officers , encountered controversy , as it was seen as an attack against the entire police force . According to Ice @-@ T , " I thought I was safe . I thought within the world of rock 'n'roll , you could be free to write what you want . Hell , I was listening to Talking Heads singin ' ' Psycho Killer . ' Fuck it , I 'll make ' Cop Killer ' ! But , that was the cross of metal with something that was real . Now we ’ re not just killing your family , we ’ re killing somebody so real that everybody just went , ' oh shit . ' " 
 The Dallas Police Association and the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas launched a campaign to force Warner Bros. Records to withdraw the album . Within a week , they were joined by police organizations across the United States . Some critics argued that the song could cause crime and violence . Many defended the song on the basis of the group 's right to freedom of speech . In The Ice Opinion : Who Gives a Fuck , Ice @-@ T wrote that " The people who did have a platform were way off backing me on the First Amendment . That 's not where all the anger should have been directed . The anger should have been generated back at the police . [ ... ] Because people jumped on the wrong issue they were able to drive this thing totally through Warner Brothers . " 
 Over the next month , controversy against the band grew . Vice President Dan Quayle branded " Cop Killer " as being " obscene , " and President George H.W. Bush publicly denounced any record company that would release such a product . At a Time @-@ Warner shareholders ' meeting , actor Charlton Heston stood and read lyrics from the song " KKK Bitch " to an astonished audience and demanded that the company take action . The criticism escalated to the point where death threats were sent to Time @-@ Warner executives , and shareholders threatened to pull out of the company . Finally , Ice @-@ T decided to remove " Cop Killer " from the album of his own volition . In an interview , Ice @-@ T stated that " I didn 't want my band to get pigeon @-@ holed as that 's the only reason that record sold . It just got outta hand and I was just tired of hearing it . I said , ' fuck it , ' I mean they 're saying we did it for money , and we didn 't . I 'd gave the record away , ya know , let 's move on , let 's get back to real issues , not a record but the cops that are out there killing people . " 
 " Cop Killer " was replaced by a new version of " Freedom of Speech , " a song from Ice @-@ T 's 1989 solo album The Iceberg / Freedom of Speech ... Just Watch What You Say . The song was re @-@ edited and remixed to give it a more rock @-@ oriented sound . Ice @-@ T left Warner Bros. Records the following year because of disputes over the Ice @-@ T solo album Home Invasion , taking Body Count with him . Despite the controversy , the album received some praise , including A- reviews from Entertainment Weekly and The Village Voice , who later ranked the album among their list of The 40 Best Albums of 1992 . Variety reported that the album had sold 480 @,@ 000 copies by January 29 , 1993 .

 In 1993 , Body Count recorded a cover of " Hey Joe " for the Jimi Hendrix tribute album Stone Free : A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix . The band released their second album , Born Dead in 1994 on Virgin Records . Prior to the recording of Body Count 's third album Violent Demise : The Last Days ( 1997 ) , bassist Mooseman left the group and was replaced by Griz . Drummer Beatmaster V died of leukemia soon after the album was completed , and a new drummer named O.T. filled in the position . Bassist Griz left the band later on , and in the meanwhile , former bassist Mooseman was shot in a drive @-@ by shooting in February 2001 after recording an album and preparing for another tour with Iggy Pop in his band the Trolls . In late 2004 , rhythm guitarist D @-@ Roc died due to complications from lymphoma , leaving only Ice @-@ T and Ernie C from the original line @-@ up . 
 Ice @-@ T has stated that " For me , honestly , after something like that , you can either come to a dead stop or you can go on . [ ... ] It was so emotional . We were in the middle of making a new record together and he goes and dies ? It was like , ' damn ! ' Soon enough , though , everybody was like , ' c 'mon c 'mon you gotta do it . ' It was make @-@ or @-@ break . The key essence of Body Count is it 's a band made up of friends . It 's not about going out and hiring the best drummer or the best guitarist . If we don 't know you , you can ’ t be in the band . " 
 In July 2006 , Body Count released their fourth album , Murder 4 Hire on the indie record label <unk> Music . Its album cover , featuring Uncle Sam holding a cardboard sign reading " Will Kill for Money , " compares the United States military to contract killers . The then @-@ line @-@ up included drummer O.T. , bassist Vincent Price and rhythm guitarist <unk> . The band then took an extended hiatus for a couple of years ; in regards to the future of Body Count , Ernie C stated , " We will carry on the band . I don 't know if it will be Body Count , but in some form , Ice and I will always play together . "

 On September 6 , 2009 , Body Count made an appearance at the Vans Warped Tour 15th @-@ anniversary party at Club Nokia in downtown Los Angeles . The group played a 20 @-@ minute set , covered Slayer , and closed with their controversial classic " Cop Killer " . Also on the bill were NOFX , Katy Perry , Pennywise , Bad Religion and Rise Against . Mike Sullivan of <unk> recently caught up with Ernie C at the 2010 edition of the Vans Warped Tour . While briefly chatting , Ernie C divulged that the band is recording its fifth studio album . Body Count wrote an exclusive song , " The Gears of War " , for the video game Gears of War 3 , and performed it at a party promoting the game . 
 On December 9 , 2012 , Ice @-@ T announced on Twitter that Body Count would begin production on a fifth studio album in January 2013 . The following day , Ice @-@ T revealed that Body Count has signed with Sumerian Records . Ice @-@ T suggested that the album was going to be titled Rise ! or Manslaughter . 
 On May 10 , 2013 , Ice @-@ T announced that work on the fifth studio album had begun and that it would be titled Manslaughter . The album was released on June 10 , 2014 . On May 13 , 2014 , Ice @-@ T played the song " Talk Shit , Get Shot " as a teaser for the new album . 
 The new Body Count album is expected to be released in 2017 . 
 = = Style = = 
 = = = Lyrics = = = 
 Ice @-@ T 's lyrics focus on reality @-@ based themes , including gang life , because he felt it would be scarier than the fantasy @-@ based horror themes of most heavy metal bands . The band 's third album , Violent Demise : The Last Days , featured album cover art depicting the hand signs of these gangs . According to Ice @-@ T , " We named the group Body Count because every Sunday night in L.A. , I 'd watch the news , and the newscasters would tally up the youths killed in gang homicides that week and then just segue to sports . ' Is that all I am , ' I thought , ' a body count ? ' " 
 When the band 's debut album was released , Ice @-@ T defined it as being " a rock album with a rap mentality . " Like Ice @-@ T 's hip hop albums , the group 's material focused on various social and political issues , with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse . Ernie C has stated that " We were just a band that played the songs that we knew how to write . Everybody writes about whatever they learned growing up , and we were no exception . Like the Beach Boys sing about the beach , we sing about the way we grew up . " 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Body Count 's musical style derives from the dark , ominous tone of heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath , as well as faster thrash metal bands such as Slayer . The band 's music is described as speed metal and thrash metal . According to Ernie C , " We wanted to be a big punk band [ ... ] Our first record is almost a punk record . " The presence of a rapper in a heavy metal band has been credited for paving the way for the rise of rap metal and nu metal , even though Ice @-@ T does not rap in most Body Count songs , and considers it to solely be a rock band . According to Ernie C , " A lot of rappers want to be in a rock band , but it has to be done sincerely . You can ’ t just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work . [ ... ] Ice and I , on the other hand , really loved the music we were doing , and it showed . "

 = Premier League = 
 The Premier League is an English professional league for men 's association football clubs . At the top of the English football league system , it is the country 's primary football competition . Contested by 20 clubs , it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League ( EFL ; known as " The Football League " before 2016 – 17 ) . Welsh clubs that compete in the English football league system can also qualify . 
 The Premier League is a corporation in which the 20 member clubs act as shareholders . Seasons run from August to May . Teams play 38 matches each ( playing each team in the league twice , home and away ) , totalling 380 matches in the season . Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons ; others during weekday evenings . It is colloquially known as the Premiership and outside the UK it is commonly referred to as the English Premier League ( EPL ) . 
 The competition formed as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League , which was originally founded in 1888 , and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal . The deal was worth £ 1 billion a year domestically as of 2013 – 14 , with BSkyB and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively . The league generates € 2 @.@ 2 billion per year in domestic and international television rights . In 2014 / 15 , teams were apportioned revenues of £ 1 @.@ 6 billion . 
 The Premier League is the most @-@ watched football league in the world , broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4 @.@ 7 billion people . In the 2014 – 15 season , the average Premier League match attendance exceeded 36 @,@ 000 , second highest of any professional football league behind the Bundesliga 's 43 @,@ 500 . Most stadium occupancies are near capacity . The Premier League ranks third in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons . 
 While 47 clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992 , only six have won the title : Manchester United ( 13 ) , Chelsea ( 4 ) , Arsenal ( 3 ) , Manchester City ( 2 ) , Blackburn Rovers and Leicester City ( 1 ) . The current champions are Leicester City , who won the title in 2015 – 16 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 Despite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s , the late ' 80s marked a low point for English football . Stadiums were crumbling , supporters endured poor facilities , hooliganism was rife , and English clubs were banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985 . The Football League First Division , the top level of English football since 1888 , was behind leagues such as Italy 's Serie A and Spain 's La Liga in attendances and revenues , and several top English players had moved abroad . 
 By the turn of the 1990s the downward trend was starting to reverse : at the 1990 FIFA World Cup , England reached the semi @-@ finals ; UEFA , European football 's governing body , lifted the five @-@ year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990 , resulting in Manchester United lifting the UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup in 1991 , and the Taylor Report on stadium safety standards , which proposed expensive upgrades to create all @-@ seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster , was published in January of that year . 
 Revenue from television also became more important : the Football League received £ 6 @.@ 3 million for a two @-@ year agreement in 1986 , but when that deal was renewed in 1988 , the price rose to £ 44 million over four years . The 1988 negotiations were the first signs of a breakaway league : ten clubs threatened to leave and form a " super league " , but were eventually persuaded to stay . As stadiums improved and match attendance and revenues rose , the country 's top teams again considered leaving the Football League in order to capitalise on the influx of money into the sport . 
 = = = Foundation = = = 
 At the close of the 1991 season , a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall . The Founder Members Agreement , signed on 17 July 1991 by the game 's top @-@ flight clubs , established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League . The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League , giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements . The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe . 
 The managing director of London Weekend Television ( LWT ) , Greg Dyke , met with the representatives of the " big five " football clubs in England in 1990 . The meeting was to pave the way for a break away from The Football League . Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money . The five clubs decided it was a good idea and decided to press ahead with it ; however , the league would have no credibility without the backing of The Football Association and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea . The FA did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it as a way to weaken the Football League 's position . 
 In 1992 , the First Division clubs resigned from the Football League en masse and on 27 May 1992 the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company working out of an office at the Football Association 's then headquarters in Lancaster Gate . This meant a break @-@ up of the 104 @-@ year @-@ old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions ; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three . There was no change in competition format ; the same number of teams competed in the top flight , and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted . 
 The league held its first season in 1992 – 93 and was originally composed of 22 clubs . The first ever Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2 – 1 win against Manchester United . The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were Arsenal , Aston Villa , Blackburn Rovers , Chelsea , Coventry City , Crystal Palace , Everton , Ipswich Town , Leeds United , Liverpool , Manchester City , Manchester United , Middlesbrough , Norwich City , Nottingham Forest , Oldham Athletic , Queens Park Rangers , Sheffield United , Sheffield Wednesday , Southampton , Tottenham Hotspur , and Wimbledon . Luton Town , Notts County and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old first division at the end of the 1991 – 92 season , and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season . 
 = = = " Big Four " dominance ( 2000s ) = = = 
 One significant feature of the Premier League in the mid @-@ 2000s was the dominance of the so @-@ called " Big Four " clubs : Arsenal , Chelsea , Liverpool and Manchester United . During this decade , and particularly from 2002 to 2009 , they dominated the top four spots , which came with UEFA Champions League qualification , taking all top four places in 5 out of 6 seasons from 2003 – 04 to 2008 – 09 inclusive , with Arsenal going as far as winning the league without losing a single game in 2003 – 04 , the only time it has ever happened in the Premier League . In May 2008 Kevin Keegan stated that " Big Four " dominance threatened the division , " This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world . " Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence : " There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you 're at the top , in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting . " 
 The years following 2009 marked a shift in the structure of the " Big Four " with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City both breaking into the top four . In the 2009 – 10 season , Tottenham finished fourth and became the first team to break the top four since Everton in 2005 . Criticism of the gap between an elite group of " super clubs " and the majority of the Premier League has continued , nevertheless , due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs . Manchester City won the title in the 2011 – 12 season , becoming the first club outside the " Big Four " to win since 1994 – 95 . That season also saw two of the Big Four ( Chelsea and Liverpool ) finish outside the top four places for the first time since 1994 – 95 . In the following four seasons , Manchester United found themselves outside of the top four twice ( in 2013 – 14 and 2015 – 16 ) while Chelsea finished 10th in the 2015 – 16 season and Liverpool finished outside the top four in three of those four seasons . Arsenal , however , remained in the top four in all four seasons and have never finished outside the top four since Arsène Wenger took charge of the club in 1996 . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Due to insistence by the International Federation of Association Football ( FIFA ) , the international governing body of football , that domestic leagues reduce the number of games clubs played , the number of clubs was reduced to 20 in 1995 when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted . On 8 June 2006 , FIFA requested that all major European leagues , including Italy 's Serie A and Spain 's La Liga be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007 – 08 season . The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction . Ultimately , the 2007 – 08 season kicked off again with 20 teams . 
 The league changed its name from the FA Premier League to simply the Premier League in 2007 . 
 = = Corporate structure = = 
 The Football Association Premier League Ltd ( <unk> ) is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs . Each club is a shareholder , with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts . The clubs elect a chairman , chief executive , and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league . The current chairman is Sir Dave Richards , who was appointed in April 1999 , and the chief executive is Richard Scudamore , appointed in November 1999 . The former chairman and chief executive , John Quinton and Peter Leaver , were forced to resign in March 1999 after awarding consultancy contracts to former Sky executives Sam Chisholm and David Chance . The Football Association is not directly involved in the day @-@ to @-@ day operations of the Premier League , but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league . 
 The Premier League sends representatives to UEFA 's European Club Association , the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to UEFA coefficients . For the 2012 – 13 season the Premier League has 10 representatives in the Association : Arsenal , Aston Villa , Chelsea , Everton , Fulham , Liverpool , Manchester City , Manchester United , Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur . The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFA 's Club Competitions Committee , which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Europa League . 
 = = Competition format = = 
 = = = Competition = = = 
 There are 20 clubs in the Premier League . During the course of a season ( from August to May ) each club plays the others twice ( a double round @-@ robin system ) , once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents , for a total of 38 games . Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw . No points are awarded for a loss . Teams are ranked by total points , then goal difference , and then goals scored . If still equal , teams are deemed to occupy the same position . If there is a tie for the championship , for relegation , or for qualification to other competitions , a play @-@ off match at a neutral venue decides rank . The three lowest placed teams are relegated into the Football League Championship , and the top two teams from the Championship , together with the winner of play @-@ offs involving the third to sixth placed Championship clubs , are promoted in their place . 
 = = = Qualification for European competitions = = = 
 As of the 2009 – 10 season qualification for the UEFA Champions League changed , the top four teams in the Premier League qualify for the UEFA Champions League , with the top three teams directly entering the group stage . Previously only the top two teams qualified automatically . The fourth @-@ placed team enters the Champions League at the play @-@ off round for non @-@ champions and must win a two @-@ legged knockout tie in order to enter the group stage . 
 The team placed fifth in the Premier League automatically qualifies for the UEFA Europa League , and the sixth and seventh @-@ placed teams can also qualify , depending on the winners of the two domestic cup competitions i.e. the FA Cup and the Capital One Cup ( League Cup ) . Two Europa League places are reserved for the winners of each tournament ; if the winner of either the FA Cup or League Cup qualifies for the Champions League , then that place will go to the next @-@ best placed finisher in the Premier League . A further place in the UEFA Europa League is also available via the Fair Play initiative . If the Premier League has one of the three highest Fair Play rankings in Europe , the highest ranked team in the Premier League Fair Play standings which has not already qualified for Europe will automatically qualify for the UEFA Europa League first qualifying round . 
 An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005 , after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before , but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season . UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League , giving England five qualifiers . UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing . However , for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League , this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league , it would qualify at the expense of the fourth @-@ placed team in the league . At that time , no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League . This occurred in 2012 , when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League the previous year , but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur , who went into the Europa League . 
 Starting with the 2015 – 16 season , the Europa League champion automatically qualifies for the following season 's Champions League , and the maximum number of Champions League places for any single association has increased to five . An association with four Champions League places , such as The FA , will only earn a fifth place if a club from that association that does not qualify for the Champions League through its league wins either the Champions League or Europa League . 
 In 2007 , the Premier League became the highest ranking European League based on the performances of English teams in European competitions over a five @-@ year period . This broke the eight @-@ year dominance of the Spanish league , La Liga .

 Between the 1992 – 93 season and the 2015 – 16 season , Premier League clubs had won the UEFA Champions League four times ( as well as supplying five of the runners @-@ up ) , behind Spain 's La Liga with nine wins , and Italy 's Serie A with five wins , and ahead of , among others , Germany 's Bundesliga with three wins ( see table here ) .

 Wales 
 In 2011 , a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time after Swansea City gained promotion . The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea City 's home match at the Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 2011 . In 2012 – 13 , Swansea qualified for the Europa League by winning the League Cup . The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two for the first time in 2013 – 14 , as Cardiff City gained promotion , but Cardiff City was relegated after its maiden season . 
 Because they are members of the Football Association of Wales ( FAW ) , the question of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused long @-@ running discussions in UEFA . Swansea took one of England 's three available places in the Europa League in 2013 – 14 by winning the League Cup in 2012 – 13 . The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012 . 
 Scotland and Ireland 
 Participation in the Premier League by some Scottish or Irish clubs has sometimes been discussed , but without result . The idea came closest to reality in 1998 , when Wimbledon received Premier League approval to relocate to Dublin , Ireland , but the move was blocked by the Football Association of Ireland . Additionally , the media occasionally discusses the idea that Scotland 's two biggest teams , Celtic and Rangers , should or will take part in the Premier League , but nothing has come of these discussions . 
 = = Sponsorship = = 
 From 1993 to 2016 , the Premier League had title sponsorship rights sold to two companies ; Barclays was the most recent title sponsor , having sponsored the Premier League from 2001 through 2016 ( until 2004 , the title sponsorship was held through its Barclaycard brand before shifting to its main banking brand in 2004 ) . 
 Barclays ' deal with the Premier League will expire at the end of the 2015 – 16 season . The FA announced on 4 June 2015 that it would not pursue any further title sponsorship deals for the Premier League , arguing that they wanted to build a " clean " brand for the competition more in line with those of major U.S. sports leagues . 
 As well as sponsorship for the league itself , the Premier League has a number of official partners and suppliers . The official ball supplier for the league is Nike who have had the contract since the 2000 – 01 season when they took over from Mitre . 
 = = Finances = = 
 The Premier League has the highest revenue of any football league in the world , with total club revenues of € 2 @.@ 48 billion in 2009 – 10 . In 2013 – 14 , due to improved television revenues and cost controls , the Premier League had net profits in excess of £ 78 million , exceeding all other football leagues . In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen 's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom 's broadcasting industry . 
 The Premier League includes some of the richest football clubs in the world . Deloitte 's " Football Money League " listed seven Premier League clubs in the top 20 for the 2009 – 10 season , and all 20 clubs were in the top 40 globally by the end of the 2013 – 14 season , largely as a result of increased broadcasting revenue . From 2013 , the league generates € 2 @.@ 2 billion per year in domestic and international television rights . 
 Premier League clubs agreed in principle in December 2012 , to radical new cost controls . The two proposals consist of a break @-@ even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season . With the new television deals on the horizon , momentum has been growing to find ways of preventing the majority of the cash going straight to players and agents .

 Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League . The League 's decision to assign broadcasting rights to BSkyB in 1992 was at the time a radical decision , but one that has paid off . At the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market , as was charging fans to watch live televised football . However , a combination of Sky 's strategy , the quality of Premier League football and the public 's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League 's TV rights soar . 
 The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis . This is in contrast to some other European Leagues , including La Liga , in which each club sells its rights individually , leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs . The money is divided into three parts : half is divided equally between the clubs ; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position , the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club , and equal steps all the way down the table ; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television , with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this . The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs . 
 The first Sky television rights agreement was worth £ 304 million over five seasons . The next contract , negotiated to start from the 1997 – 98 season , rose to £ 670 million over four seasons . The third contract was a £ 1 @.@ 024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001 – 02 to 2003 – 04 . The league brought in £ 320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three @-@ year period from 2004 – 05 to 2006 – 07 . It sold the rights itself on a territory @-@ by @-@ territory basis . Sky 's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available . This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company . Sky and Setanta paid a total of £ 1 @.@ 7 billion , a two @-@ thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth . Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers . The BBC has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons ( on Match of the Day ) for £ 171 @.@ 6 million , a 63 per cent increase on the £ 105 million it paid for the previous three @-@ year period . Sky and BT have agreed to jointly pay £ 84 @.@ 3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games ( that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet ) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 pm on matchday . Overseas television rights fetched £ 625 million , nearly double the previous contract . The total raised from these deals is more than £ 2 @.@ 7 billion , giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £ 40 million @-@ a @-@ year from 2007 to 2010 . 
 The TV rights agreement between the Premier League and Sky has faced accusations of being a cartel , and a number of court cases have arisen as a result . An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market , but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position . In July 1999 the Premier League 's method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK <unk> Practices Court , who concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest . 
 The BBC 's highlights package on Saturday and Sunday nights , as well as other evenings when fixtures justify , will run until 2016 . Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 have been purchased for £ 1 @.@ 782 billion . On 22 June 2009 , due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a £ 30 million payment to the Premier League , ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing a total of 46 matches that were available for the 2009 – 10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010 – 11 to 2012 – 13 . On 13 June 2012 , the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013 – 14 through 2015 – 16 seasons at £ 246 million @-@ a @-@ year . The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky who paid £ 760 million @-@ a @-@ year . The total domestic rights have raised £ 3 @.@ 018 billion , an increase of 70 @.@ 2 % over the 2010 – 11 to 2012 – 13 rights . The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70 @.@ 2 % in 2015 , when Sky and BT paid a total of £ 5 @.@ 136 billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018 – 19 season . 
 UK highlights 
 Between the 1998 – 99 season and the 2012 – 13 season , RTÉ broadcast highlights on Premier Soccer Saturday and occasionally Premier Soccer Sunday . During then between the 2004 – 05 season and the 2006 – 07 season , RTÉ broadcast 15 live matches on a Saturday afternoon with each match being called Premiership Live .

 The Premier League is the most @-@ watched football league in the world , broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4 @.@ 7 billion people , often on networks owned and / or controlled by 21st Century Fox ( which owns about 39 % of BSkyB in the UK ) . The Premier League 's production arm , Premier League Productions , is operated by IMG Productions and produces all content for its international television partners . 
 The Premier League is particularly popular in Asia , where it is the most widely distributed sports programme . In Australia , Fox Sports broadcasts almost all of the season 's 380 matches live , and Foxtel gives subscribers the option of selecting which Saturday 3pm match to watch . In India , the matches are broadcast live on STAR Sports . In China , the broadcast rights were awarded to Super Sports in a six @-@ year agreement that began in the 2013 – 14 season . As of the 2013 – 14 season , Canadian broadcast rights to the Premier League are jointly owned by Sportsnet and TSN , with both rival networks holding rights to 190 matches per season . 
 The Premier League is broadcast in the United States through NBC Sports . Premier League viewership has increased rapidly , with NBC and NBCSN averaging a record 479 @,@ 000 viewers in the 2014 – 15 season , up 118 % from 2012 – 13 when coverage still aired on Fox Soccer and ESPN / ESPN2 ( 220 @,@ 000 viewers ) , and NBC Sports has been widely praised for its coverage . NBC Sports reached a six @-@ year extension with the Premier League in 2015 to broadcast the league through the 2021 – 22 season in a deal valued at $ 1 billion ( £ 640 million ) . 
 = = Widening gap with lower leagues = = 
 There has been an increasing gulf between the Premier League and the Football League . Since its split with the Football League , many established clubs in the Premier League have managed to distance themselves from their counterparts in lower leagues . Owing in large part to the disparity in revenue from television rights between the leagues , many newly promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first season in the Premier League . In every season except 2001 – 02 and 2011 – 12 , at least one Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League . In 1997 – 98 all three promoted clubs were relegated at the end of the season . 
 The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue to clubs that are relegated from the league in the form of " parachute payments " . Starting with the 2013 – 14 season , these payments are in excess of £ 60 million over four seasons . Though designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues ( the average Premier League team receives £ 55 million while the average Football League Championship club receives £ 2 million ) , critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not , leading to the common occurrence of teams " bouncing back " soon after their relegation . For some clubs who have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League , financial problems , including in some cases administration or even liquidation have followed . Further relegations down the footballing ladder have ensued for several clubs unable to cope with the gap . 
 = = Stadiums = = 
 As of the 2015 – 16 season , Premier League football has been played in 53 stadiums since the formation of the Premier League in 1992 . The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished ; as a result all stadiums in the Premier League are all @-@ seater . Since the formation of the Premier League , football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities , with some clubs moving to new @-@ build stadiums . Nine stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished . The stadiums for the 2010 – 11 season show a large disparity in capacity : Old Trafford , the home of Manchester United has a capacity of 75 @,@ 957 with Bloomfield Road , the home of Blackpool , having a capacity of 16 @,@ 220 . The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2010 – 11 season is 770 @,@ 477 with an average capacity of 38 @,@ 523 . 
 Stadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for Premier League clubs . For the 2009 – 10 season , average attendances across the league clubs were 34 @,@ 215 for Premier League matches with a total aggregate attendance figure of 13 @,@ 001 @,@ 616 . This represents an increase of 13 @,@ 089 from the average attendance of 21 @,@ 126 recorded in the league 's first season ( 1992 – 93 ) . However , during the 1992 – 93 season the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the Taylor Report 's 1994 – 95 deadline for all @-@ seater stadiums . The Premier League 's record average attendance of 36 @,@ 144 was set during the 2007 – 08 season . This record was then beaten in the 2013 – 14 season recording an average attendance of 36 @,@ 695 with a total attendance of just under 14 million , the highest average in England 's top flight since 1950 . 
 = = Managers = = 
 Managers in the Premier League are involved in the day @-@ to @-@ day running of the team , including the training , team selection , and player acquisition . Their influence varies from club @-@ to @-@ club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans . Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available , and follows the completion of the UEFA ' B ' and ' A ' Licences . The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis ( i.e. more than 12 weeks – the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control ) . Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment . Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker ; examples include Paul Hart at Portsmouth and David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur . 
 The league 's longest @-@ serving manager was Alex Ferguson , who was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012 – 13 season , meaning that he was manager for all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League . Arsène Wenger is now the league 's longest @-@ serving current manager , having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League since 1996 . 
 No English manager has won the Premier League ; the eight managers to have won the title comprise two Scots : Alex Ferguson ( Manchester United , 13 wins ) and Kenny Dalglish ( Blackburn Rovers , one win ) , a Frenchman ( Arsène Wenger , Arsenal , three wins ) , a Portuguese ( José Mourinho , Chelsea , three wins ) , a Chilean ( Manuel Pellegrini , Manchester City , one win ) and three Italians ( Carlo Ancelotti , Chelsea , Roberto Mancini , Manchester City , and Claudio Ranieri , Leicester City , one win each ) .

 = = = Foreign players and transfer regulations = = = 
 At the inception of the Premier League in 1992 – 93 , just eleven players named in the starting line @-@ ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland . By 2000 – 01 , the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36 per cent of the total . In the 2004 – 05 season the figure had increased to 45 per cent . On 26 December 1999 , Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line @-@ up , and on 14 February 2005 Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16 @-@ man squad for a match . By 2009 , under 40 % of the players in the Premier League were English . 
 In response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players , in 1999 , the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union . A non @-@ EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75 per cent of its competitive ' A ' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years , and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years . If a player does not meet those criteria , the club wishing to sign him may appeal . 
 Players may only be transferred during transfer windows that are set by the Football Association . The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January . Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA , usually on an emergency basis . As of the 2010 – 11 season , the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25 @-@ man squad of players aged over 21 , with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances . This was to enable the ' home grown ' rule to be enacted , whereby the League would also from 2010 require at least 8 of the named 25 man squad to be made up of ' home @-@ grown players ' . 
 = = = Player wages and transfer fees = = = 
 There is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League . As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals , player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League when the average player wage was £ 75 @,@ 000 per year . The average salary stands at £ 1 @.@ 1 million as of the 2008 – 09 season . As of 2015 , average salaries in the Premier League are higher than for any other football league in the world . 
 The record transfer fee for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition . Prior to the start of the first Premier League season Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than £ 3 million . The record rose steadily in the Premier League 's first few seasons , until Alan Shearer made a record breaking £ 15 million move to Newcastle United in 1996 . The three highest transfer in the sport 's history had a Premier League club on the selling end , with Tottenham Hotspur selling Gareth Bale to Real Madrid for £ 85 million in 2013 , Manchester United 's sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for £ 80 million in 2009 , and Liverpool selling Luis Suárez to Barcelona for £ 75 million in 2014 .

 The Premier League maintains two trophies – the genuine trophy ( held by the reigning champions ) and a spare replica . Two trophies are held in the event that two different clubs could win the League on the final day of the season . In the rare event that more than two clubs are vying for the title on the final day of the season – then a replica won by a previous club is used . 
 The current Premier League trophy was created by Royal Jewellers Asprey of London . It consists of a trophy with a golden crown and a malachite plinth base . The plinth weighs 33 pounds ( 15 kg ) and the trophy weighs 22 pounds ( 10 @.@ 0 kg ) . The trophy and plinth are 76 cm ( 30 in ) tall , 43 cm ( 17 in ) wide and 25 cm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) deep . 
 Its main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt , while its plinth is made of malachite , a semi @-@ precious stone . The plinth has a silver band around its circumference , upon which the names of the title @-@ winning clubs are listed . Malachite 's green colour is also representative of the green field of play . The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football . Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title winning team as he raises the trophy , and its gold crown , above his head at the end of the season . The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year . 
 In 2004 , a special gold version of the trophy was commissioned to commemorate Arsenal winning the title without a single defeat .

 = Max @-@ Hellmuth Ostermann = 
 Max @-@ Hellmuth Ostermann ( 11 December 1917 – 9 August 1942 ) was a German Luftwaffe fighter ace during World War II . A flying ace or fighter ace is a military aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat . He is credited with 102 enemy aircraft shot down claimed in over 300 combat missions . The majority of his victories were claimed over the Eastern Front with eight claims over the Western Front and one over Belgrade . Ostermann was of such short height that wooden blocks had to be attached to his rudder pedals for him to engage in tight turning aerial combat . 
 Ostermann was born in Hamburg on 11 December 1917 . He joined the military service of the Luftwaffe in 1937 and was trained as a pilot . After a brief period with Zerstörergeschwader 1 ( ZG 1 ) , a heavy fighter unit , he was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 54 ( JG 54 ) . He participated in the Battle of France and Britain before transferring east . He became the sixth fighter pilot in aviation history to achieve 100 aerial victories on the Eastern Front for which he was awarded Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords . He was killed in aerial combat with Soviet fighters southeast of Lake Ilmen on 9 August 1942 . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Max @-@ Hellmuth Ostermann was born on 11 December 1917 in Hamburg . His father was a civil servant in the justice department . Ostermann joined the Luftwaffe as a Fahnenjunker ( Officer Cadet ) in March 1937 after he had received his Abitur ( diploma ) — the final exams that pupils take at the end of their secondary education . His first assignment was with I. Gruppe ( 1st group ) Zerstörergeschwader 1 ( ZG 1 ) flying the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and participated in the Invasion of Poland in 1939 . In January 1940 Hauptmann ( Captain ) Wolfgang Falck took command of I. / ZG 1 . Falck came to the opinion that the Bf 110 was just a little too big for Ostermann and had him transferred to the Messerschmitt Bf 109 equipped I. / Jagdgeschwader 21 ( JG 21 ) on 7 April 1940 . JG 21 at the time was based at Mönchengladbach and was subordinated to Oberstleutnant ( Lieutenant Colonel ) Max Ibel , the Geschwaderkommodore ( Wing Commander ) of Jagdgeschwader 27 . 
 He claimed his first of two aerial victories in the Battle of France on 20 May 1940 . Ostermann had been entrusted with leading a Rotte , an element of two aircraft , with Unteroffizier ( non @-@ commissioned officer ) Fritz Marcks as his wingman . The Schwarm ( flight ) led by Oberleutnant ( Senior Lieutenant or First Lieutenant ) Günther Scholz engaged eight French Morane @-@ Saulnier M.S.406 's fighters near Amiens with Ostermann , Marcks and Scholz claiming one each . His second aerial victory was achieved over a Curtiss Hawk @-@ 75 on 26 May 1940 . In a head on firing pass two 20mm shells tore off large parts of the aircraft 's tail fin , which then collided with <unk> 's starboard wing . The French pilot was observed to bail out with Ostermann managing to make a safe landing . 
 By the time I. / JG 21 was ordered to the coastal area of the English Channel the Gruppe was redesignated III . / Jagdgeschwader 54 ( JG 54 ) . Ostermann 's third aerial victory on 12 August 1940 may have been over Flight Lieutenant <unk> Smith of No. 610 Squadron RAF , who bailed out of his Supermarine Spitfire I <unk> . Smith was rescued from the Channel and hospitalized . On 8 October 1940 Ostermann claimed his 7th aerial victory of the war and 5th of the Battle of Britain . His opponent may have been the Czech Sergeant Josef František who was killed flying Hurricane Mk . I <unk> from No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron near Sutton , west of Croydon , in the southern outskirts of London that day . The reason for his fatal crash remains unclear . Apart from Ostermann 's claim , Leutnant ( Second Lieutenant ) Max <unk> and Feldwebel ( Sergeant or warrant officer ) Fritz <unk> also claimed one aircraft each at the same time and in the same vicinity . On 5 September 1940 III . / JG 54 's Gruppenkommandeur ( group commander ) failed to return from a mission and Geschwaderkommodore Hannes Trautloft temporarily appointed Oberleutnant Günther Scholz to lead the Gruppe . The leadership of 7 . Staffel ( 7th squadron ) was filled by Oberleutnant Hans @-@ Ekkehard Bob , who became one of Ostermann 's mentors . During an escort mission on 30 September 1940 , Bob and Ostermann claimed one Spitfire shot down each . In return Ostermann 's wingman was shot down and made a forced landing at Bexhill . He radioed his fellow pilots : 
 <unk> vier <unk> sich ab nach Kanada — <unk> 4 reports off for Canada 
 His aerial victory on 20 October 1940 over a No. 74 Squadron RAF Spitfire was his sixth — his eight overall — victory over Royal Air Force ( RAF ) fighters and his last during the Battle of Britain . The following day III . / JG 54 was instructed to relocate . Five month later following a long combat pause , JG 54 was moved to the south @-@ east to counter the pro @-@ British coup d 'état in Belgrade , Yugoslavia . He claimed his ninth victory over a Yugoslav Royal Air Force Messerschmitt Bf 109 E @-@ 3 , piloted by Karlo <unk> who was killed , on 6 April 1941 over Belgrade during the Balkans Campaign . 
 = = Eastern Front = = 
 On 23 June 1941 , during the opening phase of Operation Barbarossa , the German invasion of the Soviet Union , Ostermann , in a free @-@ hunting mission in the Lithuanian airspace north of Kaunas , intercepted a formation of nine Tupolev SB 's and claimed two shot down in flames . Leutnant Ostermann survived a belly landing following combat with more <unk> in south @-@ eastern Latvia on 26 June . On 5 July he claimed three SB @-@ 3 Soviet bombers in combat over the Velikaya River at Ostrov . He claimed his 19th and 20th aerial victory on 6 July in the same combat area . On the Eastern Front he claimed JG 54 's 1,000th victory of the war on 1 August 1941 . He became the eighth member of JG 54 to receive the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross on 4 September 1941 after 29 aerial victories . The award was presented on 10 September 1941 in Dno by Generaloberst ( Colonel General ) Alfred Keller . He claimed his 50th aerial victory on 9 January 1942 , the 60th on 28 January 1942 and the 70th on 19 February 1942 . After this series of aerial victories Ostermann was sent on home leave . The reason for his leave was that he wanted to get married . Back home , on his way to his wedding ceremony , Ostermann was arrested and put in jail . A German police officer had assumed that Ostermann , with his childlike features , was actually a schoolboy who was playing a prank and illegally wearing a Luftwaffe uniform and military decorations . The consequences endured by the police officer for his bad judgement remain unknown . 
 After he received the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves for 62 aerial victories on 12 March 1942 he was appointed Staffelkapitän ( squadron leader ) of the 8 . / JG 54 ( 8th squadron ) . His 80th and 81st aerial victory were claimed on 19 March 1942 followed by victories number 89 and 90 on 27 April 1942 . Ostermann claimed his 100th aerial victory on 12 May 1942 , the second JG 54 pilot — Hans Philipp was the first — and sixth overall to achieve the century , though in the same engagement his Bf 109F @-@ 4 was hit and damaged . Ostermann himself was hit in the right arm and upper thigh . Although severely wounded , he managed to return to his home airfield . Five days later , while in the hospital , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves with Swords . The award was presented at the Führerhauptquartier " Wolf 's Lair " ( Wolfsschanze ) at Rastenburg on 28 and 29 June 1942 . 
 Ostermann was killed in action on 9 August 1942 far behind Soviet lines east of Lake Ilmen . He and his wingman Unteroffizier Heinrich <unk> were flying at an altitude of 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) when they spotted a formation of nine Curtiss P @-@ 40 's . Ostermann shot down the rear P @-@ 40 . The two were reforming to make a second attack when they themselves were attacked from behind by a group of Soviet fighters emerging from the broken cloud cover . Ostermann 's Bf 109G @-@ 2 ( Werknummer <unk> — factory number ) was hit in the cockpit by 41 IAP 's ( 41st Fighter Aviation Regiment ) <unk> Leytenant ( First Lieutenant ) <unk> <unk> flying a LaGG @-@ 3 . The aircraft rolled over and crashed into the edge of a small wood . After Werner Mölders and Leopold Steinbatz , Ostermann was the third of 45 recipients of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords to die in World War II . This made him the first living Swords recipient to be lost in actual air combat , as Mölders death was accidental and Steinbatz had only received the Oak Leaves before he died .

 = Sakhalin Koreans = 
 Sakhalin Koreans are Russian citizens and residents of Korean descent living on Sakhalin Island , who trace their roots to the immigrants from the Gyeongsang and Jeolla provinces of Korea during the late 1930s and early 1940s , the latter half of the Japanese colonial era . At the time , the southern half of Sakhalin Island , then known as Karafuto Prefecture , was under the control of the Empire of Japan ; the Japanese government both recruited and forced Korean labourers into service and shipped them to Karafuto to fill labour shortages resulting from World War II . The Red Army invaded Karafuto days before Japan 's surrender ; while all but a few Japanese there repatriated successfully , almost one @-@ third of the Koreans could not secure permission to depart either to Japan or their home towns in South Korea . For the next forty years , they lived in exile . In 1985 , the Japanese government offered transit rights and funding for the repatriation of the original group of Sakhalin Koreans ; however , only 1 @,@ 500 of them returned to South Korea in the next two decades . The vast majority of Koreans of all generations chose instead to stay on Sakhalin . 
 Due to differing language and immigration history , Sakhalin Koreans may or may not identify themselves as Koryo @-@ saram . The term " Koryo @-@ saram " may be used to encompass to all Koreans in the former USSR , but typically refers to ethnic Koreans from <unk> province whose ancestors emigrated to the Russian Far East in the 19th century , and then were later deported to Central Asia . The issue of self @-@ identification is complicated by the fact that many Sakhalin Koreans feel that Koreans from Central Asia look down on them .

 = = = = Origins = = = = 
 Korean immigration to Sakhalin began as early as the 1910s , when the Mitsui Group began recruiting labourers from the peninsula for their mining operations . In 1920 , ten years after the annexation of Korea by Japan , there were fewer than one thousand Koreans in the whole of Karafuto Prefecture , overwhelmingly male . Aside from an influx of refugees from the Maritimes , who escaped to Karafuto during the Russian Revolution of 1917 , the number of Koreans in the province did not rise very rapidly ; as late as the mid @-@ 1930s , there were fewer than 6 @,@ 000 Koreans in Karafuto . However , as Japan 's war effort picked up , the Japanese government sought to put more people on the ground in the sparsely @-@ populated prefecture in order to ensure their control of the territory and fill the increasing demands of the coal mines and lumber yards . <unk> turned to sourcing workers from the Korean peninsula to take advantage of the low wages there ; at one point , over 150 @,@ 000 Koreans worked on the island . Of those , around 10 @,@ 000 mine workers were relocated to Japan prior to the war 's end ; present @-@ day Sakhalin Koreans ' efforts to locate them proved futile . 
 The Imperial Japanese Army in Karafuto frequently used local ethnic minorities ( <unk> , <unk> , and Ainu ) to conduct intelligence @-@ gathering activities , because , as indigenous inhabitants , their presence would not arouse suspicion on the Soviet half of the island . Ethnic Koreans could also be found on both sides of the border , but the use of Koreans as spies was not common , as the Karafuto police were wary of the support for the independence movement among Koreans . Soviet suspicion towards Korean nationalism , along with fears that the Korean community might harbour Japanese spies , led to the 1937 deportation of Koreans from Soviet @-@ controlled northern Sakhalin and the Russian Far East . 
 = = = = Soviet invasion and Japanese massacres = = = = 
 The Soviet Union invaded the Japanese portion of Sakhalin on August 11 , 1945 , resulting the deaths of 20 @,@ 000 civilians ( see Soviet – Japanese War ( 1945 ) ) . In the confusion that ensued , a rumour began to spread that ethnic Koreans could be serving as spies for the Soviet Union , and led to massacres of Koreans by Japanese police and civilians . Despite the generally limited amount of information about the massacres , two examples of massacres are comparatively well @-@ known today : the incident in <unk> ( now <unk> ) on August 18 , 1945 , and the incident in Mizuho Village ( now <unk> ) , which lasted from August 20 to August 23 , 1945 . 
 In <unk> , the Japanese police arrested 19 Koreans on charges of spy activities ; 18 were found shot within the police station the next day . The sole survivor , a Korean known only by his Japanese name Nakata , had survived by hiding in a toilet ; he later offered testimony about the event . In Mizuho Village , Japanese fleeing Soviet troops who had landed at <unk> ( now Kholmsk ) claimed that the Koreans were cooperating with the Red Army and that they were pillaging Japanese property . Though Koreans and Japanese worked alongside each other in the village on farms and construction projects , the Japanese civilians turned against their Korean neighbors , killing 27 between August 20 and 23 . Other individual Koreans may have been killed to cover up evidence of Japanese atrocities committed during the evacuation : one woman interviewed by a US @-@ Russian joint commission investigating the issue of Allied prisoners of war held by the Imperial Japanese Army in camps on Sakhalin reported that her ethnic Korean lover had been murdered by Japanese troops after he had witnessed mass shootings of hundreds of American prisoners of war . 
 = = = Integration into the Soviet Union = = = 
 = = = = Repatriation refused = = = = 
 In the years after the Soviet invasion , most of the 400 @,@ 000 Japanese civilians who had not already been evacuated during the war left voluntarily under the auspices of the US @-@ USSR Agreement on Repatriation of those left in the USSR , signed in December 1946 . Many of the 150 @,@ 000 Koreans on the island safely returned to mainland Japan , and some went to the northern half of the Korean peninsula ; however , roughly 43 @,@ 000 were not accepted for repatriation by Japan , and also could not be repatriated to the southern half of the Korean peninsula due to the political situation ; The Soviet government initially had drawn up plans to repatriate the Koreans along with the Japanese , but the local administration on Sakhalin objected , arguing that incoming Russians from the mainland would not be sufficient to replace the skilled labourers who had already departed . The indecision about the ultimate fate of the Sakhalin Koreans persisted until the outbreak of the Korean War , after which repatriation became a political impossibility . Some sources claim Stalin himself blocked their departure because he wanted to retain them as coal miners on the island . In 1957 , Seoul appealed for Tokyo 's assistance to secure the departure of ethnic Koreans from Sakhalin via Japan , but Tokyo took no real action on the request , and blamed Soviet intransigence for the lack of progress in resolving the issue ; Japan continued its earlier policy of granting entrance only to Sakhalin Koreans who were married to Japanese citizens , or had a Japanese parent . 
 During the late 1940s , the ranks of ethnic Koreans on the island were augmented by another 8 @,@ 000 North Korean expatriates , recruited by the Soviet government to work in state @-@ owned fisheries . 
 In an effort to integrate the Korean labourers , who were unfamiliar with the Soviet system and unable to speak Russian , local authorities set up schools using the Korean language as the medium of instruction . However , the Sakhalin Koreans were believed to have been " infected with the Japanese spirit " , and so for the most part the authorities did not trust them to run any of their own collective farms , mills , factories , schools , or hospitals . Instead , these tasks were left to several hundred ethnic Koreans imported from Central Asia , who were bilingual in Russian and Korean . Resentment towards the social dominance of Koreans from Central Asia over the Sakhalin Koreans led to tensions between the two groups ; the latter developed a number of disparaging terms in Korean to refer to the former . 
 The Sakhalin government 's policy towards the Sakhalin Koreans continued to shift in line with bilateral relations between North Korea and the Soviet Union . During the 1950s , North Korea demanded that the Soviets treat Sakhalin Koreans as North Korean citizens , and , through their consulate , even set up study groups and other educational facilities for them ( analogous to <unk> 's similar , more successful efforts among the Zainichi Koreans ) . During the late 1950s , it became increasingly difficult for the Sakhalin Koreans to obtain Soviet citizenship , and a growing proportion chose instead to become North Korean citizens rather to than deal with the burdens of remaining stateless , which included severe restrictions on their freedom of movement and the requirement to apply for permission from the local government in order to travel outside of Sakhalin . As of 1960 , only 25 % had been able to secure Soviet citizenship ; 65 % had declared North Korean citizenship , with the remaining 10 % choosing to remain unaffiliated despite the difficulties this entailed . However , as relations between the Soviet Union and North Korea deteriorated , the authorities acted to de @-@ emphasise Korean language education and reduce the influence of North Korea within the community ; by the early 1970s , Sakhalin Koreans were once again encouraged to apply for Soviet citizenship . 
 = = = = Attention from the outside world = = = = 
 In the late 1960s and early 1970s , the situation of the Sakhalin Koreans improved as the outside world began to pay much more attention to their situation . Starting in 1966 , Park No Hak , a former Sakhalin Korean who had earlier received permission to leave Sakhalin and settle in Japan by virtue of his having a Japanese wife , petitioned the Japanese government a total of 23 times to discuss the issue of the Sakhalin Koreans with the Soviet government . His actions inspired 500 @,@ 000 South Koreans to form an organisation to work towards the repatriation of their co @-@ ethnics ; in response , the South Korean began radio broadcasts targeted at the Sakhalin Koreans , in an effort to assure them that they had not been forgotten . At the same time , Rei Mihara , a Tokyo housewife , formed a similar pressure group in Japan , and 18 Japanese lawyers attempted to sue the Japanese government to force them to accept diplomatic and financial responsibility for the transportation of the Sakhalin Koreans and their return to South Korea . 
 Additionally , the Soviet government finally began to permit the Sakhalin Koreans to naturalize . However , as many as 10 % continued to refuse both Soviet and North Korean citizenship , and demanded repatriation to South Korea . By 1976 , only 2 @,@ 000 more of their population had been able to obtain permission to depart from Sakhalin , but that year , the Sakhalin government made a public announcement that people seeking to emigrate to South Korea could simply show up at the Immigration Office to file an application . Within a week , they had received more than 800 such applications , including some from North Korean citizens ; this caused the North Korean embassy to complain to their Soviet counterparts about the new emigration policy . The Soviet authorities in the end chose for unspecified reasons to refuse to issue exit visas to most of those concerned , leading to the unusual case of public demonstrations about the refusals by Korean families . This level of open dissent provoked the authorities to completely reverse their liberalising stance towards the Sakhalin Koreans ; they arrested more than 40 protestors , and in November 1976 deported them , but to North Korea rather than to the South as they desired . Further purges and intimidation of those seeking to emigrate also followed . Through to the early 1980s , locally born Korean youth , increasingly interested in their heritage , were seen as traitors by their Russian neighbours for wanting to know more about their ancestral land and for seeking to emigrate . The nadir of ethnic relations came after the 1983 shooting @-@ down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 by the Soviet Union .

 = = = = Improving relations with Japan = = = = 
 In 1985 , Japan agreed to approve transit rights and fund the repatriation of the first generation of Sakhalin Koreans ; the Soviet Union also began to liberalize their emigration laws in 1987 . As of 2001 , Japan spends US $ 1 @.@ 2 million a year to fund Sakhalin Koreans ' visits to Seoul . The Foreign Ministry allocated about $ 5 million to build a cultural centre in Sakhalin , which was intended to feature a library , an exhibition hall , Korean language classrooms , and other facilities , but as of 2004 , the project had not begun , causing protests among the Sakhalin Koreans . 
 On April 18 , 1990 , Taro Nakayama , Japan 's Minister for Foreign Affairs , stated : 
 " Japan is deeply sorry for the tragedy in which these ( Korean ) people were moved to Sakhalin not of their own free will but by the design of the Japanese government and had to remain there after the conclusion of the war " . 
 The foreign trade of Sakhalin with Japan is still roughly four times that with Korea , and Japanese companies greatly outnumber their Korean on the island . As a result , while members of the first generation still carry anti @-@ Japanese sentiment , the younger generations have developed an interest in Japanese culture and have taken up the study of the Japanese language , much to the consternation of their elders . On October 28 , 2006 , a Korean student from the Sakhalin State University placed second in the All @-@ CIS Japanese Language Students Competition . 
 = = = = North and South Korean influence = = = = 
 During the 1990s , commerce , communication , and direct flights opened up between Sakhalin and South Korea , and the two Koreas began to vie openly for influence among the Sakhalin Koreans . Television and radio programmes from both North and South Korea , as well as local programming , began to be broadcast on Sakhalin Korean Broadcasting , the only Korean television station in all of Russia . North Korea negotiated with Russia for closer economic relations with Sakhalin , and recently sponsored an art show in Yuzhno @-@ Sakhalinsk . They have also permitted delegations of Sakhalin Koreans to visit relatives in North Korea . Scholarly studies suggest that roughly 1 @,@ 000 Sakhalin Koreans have opted to repatriate to North Korea , but the rise of the South Korean economy combined with the ongoing economic and political turmoil in the North have made this option less attractive . Sakhalin Koreans have also provided assistance to refugees fleeing North Korea , either those who illegally escaped across the border , or those who escaped North Korean labour camps in Russia itself . 
 South Korea and Japan jointly funded the building of a nursing home for elderly Sakhalin Koreans in <unk> , a suburb of Seoul , and under the auspices of the Korean Red Cross , 1 @,@ 544 people had settled there and in other locations by the end of 2002 , while another 14 @,@ 122 had travelled to South Korea on short @-@ term visits at Japanese government expense . South Korean investors also began to participate in the international tenders for works contracts to develop the Sakhalin Shelf , as they are interested in the potential supply of liquefied natural gas . By the year 2000 , South Korean missionaries had opened several churches , and South Koreans comprised the majority of international students at the Sakhalin State University . The Korean Residents ' Association on Sakhalin , an ethnic representative body , is generally described as being pro @-@ South Korean , analogous to Japan 's <unk> . In addition to the elderly , a few younger Koreans have also chosen to move to South Korea , either to find their roots , or for economic reasons , as wages in South Korea are as much as three times those in Sakhalin . However , upon arrival , they often find that they are viewed as foreigners by the South Korean locals , despite their previous exposure to Korean culture in Sakhalin . As one returnee put it , " Sakhalin Koreans live in a different world than Sakhalin Russians but that world isn ’ t Korea " . In general , younger Sakhalin Koreans , especially those lacking fluency in the Korean language , prefer to stay on Sakhalin . Of the 1 @,@ 544 Koreans who repatriated to South Korea as of 2005 , nearly 10 % eventually returned to Sakhalin . Conversely , some foreign students from Korea studying in Sakhalin also reported difficulties in befriending local Koreans , claiming that the latter looked down on them for being foreigners . 
 = = = = Local interethnic relations = = = = 
 In the late 1980s , suspicions against the Sakhalin Koreans remained . With the relaxation of internal migration controls and the dissolution of the Soviet Union , Russians began moving en masse back to the mainland , making ethnic Koreans an increasing proportion of the population ; there were fears that they might become a majority of the island 's population , and seek an autonomous republic or even independence . However , the rise of the regional economy and the cultural assimilation of the younger generations drove more than 95 % of Koreans to stay in Sakhalin or move to the Russian Far East rather than leave for South Korea , as they have come to consider Russia their home country . The Sakhalin Koreans ' family connections in South Korea have benefited even those who remained on Sakhalin with easier access to South Korean business and imports ; trade with South Korea has brought the Sakhalin Koreans a better economic standing than the average resident of Sakhalin . By 2004 , inter @-@ ethnic relations between Russians and Koreans had improved greatly and were generally not described as being a problem on Sakhalin . However , Sakhalin Koreans who have travelled to the mainland of Russia , or have relocated to there ( a population of roughly 10 @,@ 000 ) , report that they have encountered various forms of racism . 
 Among the Koreans who remain on Sakhalin , roughly 7 @,@ 000 of the original generation of settlers survive , while their locally born descendants make up the rest of the local Korean population . They are highly urbanized ; half live in the administrative centre of Yuzhno @-@ Sakhalinsk , where Koreans constitute nearly 12 % of the population . Around thirty per cent of Sakhalin ’ s thirty thousand Koreans still have not taken Russian citizenship . Unlike ethnic Russians or other local minority groups , Sakhalin Koreans are exempted from conscription , but there have been calls for this exemption to be terminated .

 See also List of Korean family names and <unk> of Korean . 
 Korean surnames , when <unk> , may be spelled slightly differently from the <unk> used in the US ; the resulting common pronunciations also differ , as can be seen in the table at right . Furthermore , Korean naming practices and Russian naming practices conflict in several important ways . While most members of the older generations of Sakhalin Koreans used Korean names , members of the younger generations favor their Russian names . However , with the increasing exposure to South Korean pop culture , some younger Koreans have named their children after characters in Korean television dramas . The use of patronymics is not widespread . 
 In addition to Korean names , the oldest generation of Sakhalin Koreans are often legally registered under Japanese names , which they had originally adopted due to the <unk> @-@ <unk> policy of the Japanese colonial era . After the Soviet invasion , the Sakhalin authorities conducted name registration for the local Koreans on the basis of the Japanese identity documents issued by the old Karafuto government ; as of 2006 , the Russian government uniformly refused requests for re @-@ registration under Korean names . 
 = = = Language = = = 
 Due to their greater population density and expectation that they would one day be allowed to return to Korea , the Sakhalin Koreans have kept something of a <unk> mentality rather than a settler mentality , which influenced their relation to the surrounding society ; even today , they tend to speak much better Korean than those who were deported to Central Asia . A weekly Korean language newspaper , the <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , has been published since 1949 , while Sakhalin Korean Broadcasting began operation in 1956 . Korean @-@ language television programmes are broadcast locally , but typically with Russian subtitles . Additionally , during the Soviet era , Sakhalin Koreans were often hired to act as announcers and writers for official media aimed at the Koryo @-@ saram in Central Asia . However , unlike the Koryo @-@ saram , the spoken Korean of Sakhalin is not very closely related to <unk> dialect or Koryo @-@ mar , but is instead descended from Jeolla and Gyeongsang dialects . As a result of the diplomatic situation up until the 1980s , during which South Korea had no relations with the Soviet Union , Korean @-@ language instructional materials were provided by North Korea or developed domestically . Oddly enough , as a result , Sakhalin Koreans ' writing , like that of Koryo @-@ saram , follows the North Korean standard , but their spoken Korean in radio broadcasts has come to resemble the Seoul dialect of South Korea . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union , there has been significant growth in religious activities among the Sakhalin Koreans ; the establishment of churches was noted in scholarly articles as early as 1990 . Christian hymns have become popular listening material , supplementing the more typical Russian , Western , and Korean pop music . Korean churches also broadcast religious content through Sakhalin Korean Broadcasting ; a Baptist church run by ethnic Koreans sponsors a journalist there . However , large @-@ scale religious events can be subjected to restriction by the government authorities : in June 1998 the local Russian Orthodox Church and the regional administration of Sakhalin successfully pressured Korean Presbyterian missionaries to cancel a conference of more than 100 Presbyterian and other Protestant missionaries from around the former Soviet Union . Ethnic Koreans are numerous among the church @-@ goers of the Roman Catholic parish of St. James in Yuzhno @-@ Sakhalinsk . Catholic missions in Kholmsk and <unk> have also a fair amount of Korean parishioners . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 In one survey , a third of the Sakhalin Korean population expressed a preference for traditional Korean music , a far higher proportion than in any other ethnic Korean community surveyed . However , despite their better knowledge of Korean language , the same survey showed that Korean pop music is less widespread among Sakhalin Koreans than among ethnic Koreans in Kazakhstan , possessing about the same degree of popularity as in Uzbekistan . Sakhalin Koreans also reported listening to Western popular and classical music at much lower rates than Koreans in the rest of the former Soviet Union . Study of traditional Korean musical instruments has also been gaining popularity across all generations . The Ethnos Arts School was established in 1991 in Yuzhno @-@ Sakhalinsk to teach children 's classes in traditional Korean dance , piano , sight singing , and the <unk> , a zither @-@ like instrument supposedly invented around the time of the Gaya confederacy .

 = Brain = 
 The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals . Only a few invertebrates such as sponges , jellyfish , adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain ; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead . The brain is located in the head , usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision , hearing , balance , taste , and smell . The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate 's body . In a typical human , the cerebral cortex ( the largest part ) is estimated to contain 15 – 33 billion neurons , each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons . These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons , which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells . 
 <unk> , the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body . The brain acts on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones . This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment . Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia , but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain . 
 The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved . Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer , very different in mechanism from an electronic computer , but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world , stores it , and processes it in a variety of ways , analogous to the central processing unit ( CPU ) in a computer . 
 This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species , with the greatest attention to vertebrates . It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains . The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article . Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context . The most important is brain disease and the effects of brain damage , covered in the human brain article because the most common diseases of the human brain either do not show up in other species , or else manifest themselves in different ways . 
 = = Anatomy = = 
 The shape and size of the brain varies greatly in different species , and identifying common features is often difficult . Nevertheless , there are a number of principles of brain architecture that apply across a wide range of species . Some aspects of brain structure are common to almost the entire range of animal species ; others distinguish " advanced " brains from more primitive ones , or distinguish vertebrates from invertebrates . 
 The simplest way to gain information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection , but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed . Brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with , but it can be hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives , and then sliced apart for examination of the interior . Visually , the interior of the brain consists of areas of so @-@ called grey matter , with a dark color , separated by areas of white matter , with a lighter color . Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations . It is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope , and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another . 
 = = = Cellular structure = = = 
 The brains of all species are composed primarily of two broad classes of cells : neurons and glial cells . Glial cells ( also known as glia or <unk> ) come in several types , and perform a number of critical functions , including structural support , metabolic support , insulation , and guidance of development . Neurons , however , are usually considered the most important cells in the brain . The property that makes neurons unique is their ability to send signals to specific target cells over long distances . They send these signals by means of an axon , which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects , usually with numerous branches , to other areas , sometimes nearby , sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body . The length of an axon can be extraordinary : for example , if a pyramidal cell , ( an excitatory neuron ) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body , its axon , equally magnified , would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter , extending more than a kilometer . These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials , which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1 – 100 meters per second . Some neurons emit action potentials constantly , at rates of 10 – 100 per second , usually in irregular patterns ; other neurons are quiet most of the time , but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials . 
 Axons transmit signals to other neurons by means of specialized junctions called synapses . A single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells . When an action potential , traveling along an axon , arrives at a synapse , it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released . The neurotransmitter binds to receptor molecules in the membrane of the target cell . 
 Synapses are the key functional elements of the brain . The essential function of the brain is cell @-@ to @-@ cell communication , and synapses are the points at which communication occurs . The human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses ; even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million . The functions of these synapses are very diverse : some are excitatory ( exciting the target cell ) ; others are inhibitory ; others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways . A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable ; that is , they are capable of changing strength in a way that is controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them . It is widely believed that activity @-@ dependent modification of synapses is the brain 's primary mechanism for learning and memory . 
 Most of the space in the brain is taken up by axons , which are often bundled together in what are called nerve fiber tracts . A myelinated axon is wrapped in a fatty insulating sheath of myelin , which serves to greatly increase the speed of signal propagation . ( There are also <unk> axons ) . <unk> is white , making parts of the brain filled exclusively with nerve fibers appear as light @-@ colored white matter , in contrast to the darker @-@ colored grey matter that marks areas with high densities of neuron cell bodies . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 = = = = Generic bilaterian nervous system = = = = 
 Except for a few primitive organisms such as sponges ( which have no nervous system ) and cnidarians ( which have a nervous system consisting of a diffuse nerve net ) , all living multicellular animals are bilaterians , meaning animals with a bilaterally symmetric body shape ( that is , left and right sides that are approximate mirror images of each other ) . All bilaterians are thought to have descended from a common ancestor that appeared early in the Cambrian period , 485 @-@ 540 million years ago , and it has been hypothesized that this common ancestor had the shape of a simple <unk> with a segmented body . At a schematic level , that basic worm @-@ shape continues to be reflected in the body and nervous system architecture of all modern bilaterians , including vertebrates . The fundamental bilateral body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from the mouth to the anus , and a nerve cord with an enlargement ( a ganglion ) for each body segment , with an especially large ganglion at the front , called the brain . The brain is small and simple in some species , such as nematode worms ; in other species , including vertebrates , it is the most complex organ in the body . Some types of worms , such as leeches , also have an enlarged ganglion at the back end of the nerve cord , known as a " tail brain " . 
 There are a few types of existing bilaterians that lack a recognizable brain , including echinoderms , tunicates , and <unk> ( a group of primitive flatworms ) . It has not been definitively established whether the existence of these brainless species indicates that the earliest bilaterians lacked a brain , or whether their ancestors evolved in a way that led to the disappearance of a previously existing brain structure . 
 = = = = Invertebrates = = = = 
 This category includes arthropods , molluscs , and numerous types of worms . The diversity of invertebrate body plans is matched by an equal diversity in brain structures . 
 Two groups of invertebrates have notably complex brains : arthropods ( insects , crustaceans , arachnids , and others ) , and cephalopods ( octopuses , squids , and similar molluscs ) . The brains of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend through the body of the animal . Arthropods have a central brain , the <unk> ganglion , with three divisions and large optical lobes behind each eye for visual processing . Cephalopods such as the octopus and squid have the largest brains of any invertebrates . 
 There are several invertebrate species whose brains have been studied intensively because they have properties that make them convenient for experimental work : 
 Fruit flies ( Drosophila ) , because of the large array of techniques available for studying their genetics , have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in brain development . In spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals , many aspects of Drosophila <unk> have been shown to be relevant to humans . The first biological clock genes , for example , were identified by examining Drosophila mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles . A search in the genomes of vertebrates revealed a set of analogous genes , which were found to play similar roles in the mouse biological clock — and therefore almost certainly in the human biological clock as well . Studies done on Drosophila , also show that most <unk> regions of the brain are continuously reorganized throughout life in response to specific living conditions . 
 The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans , like Drosophila , has been studied largely because of its importance in genetics . In the early 1970s , Sydney Brenner chose it as a model organism for studying the way that genes control development . One of the advantages of working with this worm is that the body plan is very stereotyped : the nervous system of the hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons , always in the same places , making identical synaptic connections in every worm . Brenner 's team sliced worms into thousands of <unk> sections and photographed each one under an electron microscope , then visually matched fibers from section to section , to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body . The complete neuronal wiring diagram of <unk> – its connectome was achieved . Nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism , and the information gained has enabled a multitude of studies that would otherwise have not been possible . 
 The sea slug Aplysia californica was chosen by Nobel Prize @-@ winning neurophysiologist Eric Kandel as a model for studying the cellular basis of learning and memory , because of the simplicity and accessibility of its nervous system , and it has been examined in hundreds of experiments . 
 = = = = Vertebrates = = = = 
 The first vertebrates appeared over 500 million years ago ( Mya ) , during the Cambrian period , and may have resembled the modern hagfish in form . Sharks appeared about 450 Mya , amphibians about 400 Mya , reptiles about 350 Mya , and mammals about 200 Mya . Each species has an equally long evolutionary history , but the brains of modern hagfishes , lampreys , sharks , amphibians , reptiles , and mammals show a gradient of size and complexity that roughly follows the evolutionary sequence . All of these brains contain the same set of basic anatomical components , but many are rudimentary in the hagfish , whereas in mammals the foremost part ( the telencephalon ) is greatly elaborated and expanded . 
 Brains are most simply compared in terms of their size . The relationship between brain size , body size and other variables has been studied across a wide range of vertebrate species . As a rule , brain size increases with body size , but not in a simple linear proportion . In general , smaller animals tend to have larger brains , measured as a fraction of body size . For mammals , the relationship between brain volume and body mass essentially follows a power law with an exponent of about 0 @.@ 75 . This formula describes the central tendency , but every family of mammals departs from it to some degree , in a way that reflects in part the complexity of their behavior . For example , primates have brains 5 to 10 times larger than the formula predicts . Predators tend to have larger brains than their prey , relative to body size . 
 All vertebrate brains share a common underlying form , which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development . In its earliest form , the brain appears as three swellings at the front end of the neural tube ; these swellings eventually become the forebrain , midbrain , and hindbrain ( the <unk> , mesencephalon , and <unk> , respectively ) . At the earliest stages of brain development , the three areas are roughly equal in size . In many classes of vertebrates , such as fish and amphibians , the three parts remain similar in size in the adult , but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts , and the midbrain becomes very small . 
 The brains of vertebrates are made of very soft tissue . Living brain tissue is pinkish on the outside and mostly white on the inside , with subtle variations in color . Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the skull from the brain . Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers . The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another , forming the blood – brain barrier , which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens ( though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs , thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain ) . 
 <unk> usually divide the vertebrate brain into six main regions : the telencephalon ( cerebral hemispheres ) , diencephalon ( thalamus and hypothalamus ) , mesencephalon ( midbrain ) , cerebellum , pons , and medulla oblongata . Each of these areas has a complex internal structure . Some parts , such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex , consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space . Other parts , such as the thalamus and hypothalamus , consist of clusters of many small nuclei . Thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within the vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure , chemistry , and connectivity . 
 Although the same basic components are present in all vertebrate brains , some branches of vertebrate evolution have led to substantial distortions of brain geometry , especially in the forebrain area . The brain of a shark shows the basic components in a straightforward way , but in teleost fishes ( the great majority of existing fish species ) , the forebrain has become " everted " , like a sock turned inside out . In birds , there are also major changes in forebrain structure . These distortions can make it difficult to match brain components from one species with those of another species . 
 Here is a list of some of the most important vertebrate brain components , along with a brief description of their functions as currently understood : 
 The medulla , along with the spinal cord , contains many small nuclei involved in a wide variety of sensory and involuntary motor functions such as vomiting , heart rate and digestive processes . 
 The pons lies in the brainstem directly above the medulla . Among other things , it contains nuclei that control often voluntary but simple acts such as sleep , respiration , swallowing , bladder function , equilibrium , eye movement , facial expressions , and posture . 
 The hypothalamus is a small region at the base of the forebrain , whose complexity and importance belies its size . It is composed of numerous small nuclei , each with distinct connections and neurochemistry . The hypothalamus is engaged in additional involuntary or partially voluntary acts such as sleep and wake cycles , eating and drinking , and the release of some hormones . 
 The thalamus is a collection of nuclei with diverse functions : some are involved in relaying information to and from the cerebral hemispheres , while others are involved in motivation . The <unk> area ( zona incerta ) seems to contain action @-@ generating systems for several types of " consummatory " behaviors such as eating , drinking , defecation , and copulation . 
 The cerebellum modulates the outputs of other brain systems , whether motor related or thought related , to make them certain and precise . Removal of the cerebellum does not prevent an animal from doing anything in particular , but it makes actions hesitant and clumsy . This precision is not built @-@ in , but learned by trial and error . The muscle coordination learned while riding a bicycle is an example of a type of neural plasticity that may take place largely within the cerebellum . 10 % of the brain 's total volume consists of the cerebellum and 50 % of all neurons are held within its structure . 
 The optic tectum allows actions to be directed toward points in space , most commonly in response to visual input . In mammals it is usually referred to as the superior colliculus , and its best @-@ studied function is to direct eye movements . It also directs reaching movements and other object @-@ directed actions . It receives strong visual inputs , but also inputs from other senses that are useful in directing actions , such as auditory input in owls and input from the <unk> pit organs in snakes . In some primitive fishes , such as lampreys , this region is the largest part of the brain . The superior colliculus is part of the midbrain . 
 The pallium is a layer of gray matter that lies on the surface of the forebrain and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ . In reptiles and mammals , it is called the cerebral cortex . Multiple functions involve the pallium , including smell and spatial memory . In mammals , where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain , it takes over functions from many other brain areas . In many mammals , the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called <unk> that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci . The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored and processed . 
 The hippocampus , strictly speaking , is found only in mammals . However , the area it derives from , the medial pallium , has counterparts in all vertebrates . There is evidence that this part of the brain is involved in complex events such as spatial memory and navigation in fishes , birds , reptiles , and mammals . 
 The basal ganglia are a group of interconnected structures in the forebrain . The primary function of the basal ganglia appears to be action selection : they send inhibitory signals to all parts of the brain that can generate motor behaviors , and in the right circumstances can release the inhibition , so that the action @-@ generating systems are able to execute their actions . Reward and punishment exert their most important neural effects by altering connections within the basal ganglia . 
 The olfactory bulb is a special structure that processes olfactory sensory signals and sends its output to the olfactory part of the pallium . It is a major brain component in many vertebrates , but is greatly reduced in humans and other primates ( whose senses are dominated by information acquired by sight rather than smell ) . 
 = = = = Mammals = = = = 
 The most obvious difference between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates is in terms of size . On average , a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as that of a bird of the same body size , and ten times as large as that of a reptile of the same body size . 
 Size , however , is not the only difference : there are also substantial differences in shape . The hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates , but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain , which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure . The cerebral cortex is the part of the brain that most strongly distinguishes mammals . In non @-@ mammalian vertebrates , the surface of the cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple three @-@ layered structure called the pallium . In mammals , the pallium evolves into a complex six @-@ layered structure called neocortex or <unk> . Several areas at the edge of the neocortex , including the hippocampus and amygdala , are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates . 
 The elaboration of the cerebral cortex carries with it changes to other brain areas . The superior colliculus , which plays a major role in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates , shrinks to a small size in mammals , and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex . The cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion ( the neocerebellum ) dedicated to supporting the cerebral cortex , which has no counterpart in other vertebrates . 
 = = = = Primates = = = = 
 The brains of humans and other primates contain the same structures as the brains of other mammals , but are generally larger in proportion to body size . The most widely accepted way of comparing brain sizes across species is the so @-@ called encephalization quotient ( EQ ) , which takes into account the nonlinearity of the brain @-@ to @-@ body relationship . Humans have an average EQ in the 7 @-@ to @-@ 8 range , while most other primates have an EQ in the 2 @-@ to @-@ 3 range . Dolphins have values higher than those of primates other than humans , but nearly all other mammals have EQ values that are substantially lower . 
 Most of the enlargement of the primate brain comes from a massive expansion of the cerebral cortex , especially the prefrontal cortex and the parts of the cortex involved in vision . The visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas , with a complex web of interconnections . It has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy more than half of the total surface of the primate neocortex . The prefrontal cortex carries out functions that include planning , working memory , motivation , attention , and executive control . It takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species , and an especially large fraction of the human brain . 
 = = Development = = 
 The brain does not simply grow , but rather develops in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages . It changes in shape from a simple swelling at the front of the nerve cord in the earliest embryonic stages , to a complex array of areas and connections . Neurons are created in special zones that contain stem cells , and then migrate through the tissue to reach their ultimate locations . Once neurons have positioned themselves , their axons sprout and navigate through the brain , branching and extending as they go , until the tips reach their targets and form synaptic connections . In a number of parts of the nervous system , neurons and synapses are produced in excessive numbers during the early stages , and then the unneeded ones are pruned away . 
 For vertebrates , the early stages of neural development are similar across all species . As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure , a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate , the precursor of the nervous system . The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove , and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube , a hollow cord of cells with a fluid @-@ filled ventricle at the center . At the front end , the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain , midbrain , and hindbrain . At the next stage , the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon ( which will contain the cerebral cortex , basal ganglia , and related structures ) and the diencephalon ( which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus ) . At about the same time , the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon ( which will contain the cerebellum and pons ) and the <unk> ( which will contain the medulla oblongata ) . Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated ; the resulting cells then migrate , sometimes for long distances , to their final positions . 
 Once a neuron is in place , it extends dendrites and an axon into the area around it . Axons , because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets , grow in a particularly complex way . The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone , studded with chemical receptors . These receptors sense the local environment , causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements , and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path . The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area , where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses . Considering the entire brain , thousands of genes create products that influence axonal pathfinding . 
 The synaptic network that finally emerges is only partly determined by genes , though . In many parts of the brain , axons initially " overgrow " , and then are " pruned " by mechanisms that depend on neural activity . In the projection from the eye to the midbrain , for example , the structure in the adult contains a very precise mapping , connecting each point on the surface of the retina to a corresponding point in a midbrain layer . In the first stages of development , each axon from the retina is guided to the right general vicinity in the midbrain by chemical cues , but then branches very profusely and makes initial contact with a wide swath of midbrain neurons . The retina , before birth , contains special mechanisms that cause it to generate waves of activity that originate spontaneously at a random point and then propagate slowly across the retinal layer . These waves are useful because they cause neighboring neurons to be active at the same time ; that is , they produce a neural activity pattern that contains information about the spatial arrangement of the neurons . This information is exploited in the midbrain by a mechanism that causes synapses to weaken , and eventually vanish , if activity in an axon is not followed by activity of the target cell . The result of this sophisticated process is a gradual tuning and tightening of the map , leaving it finally in its precise adult form . 
 Similar things happen in other brain areas : an initial synaptic matrix is generated as a result of genetically determined chemical guidance , but then gradually refined by activity @-@ dependent mechanisms , partly driven by internal dynamics , partly by external sensory inputs . In some cases , as with the retina @-@ midbrain system , activity patterns depend on mechanisms that operate only in the developing brain , and apparently exist solely to guide development . 
 In humans and many other mammals , new neurons are created mainly before birth , and the infant brain contains substantially more neurons than the adult brain . There are , however , a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life . The two areas for which adult neurogenesis is well established are the olfactory bulb , which is involved in the sense of smell , and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus , where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories . With these exceptions , however , the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life . Glial cells are different : as with most types of cells in the body , they are generated throughout the lifespan . 
 There has long been debate about whether the qualities of mind , personality , and intelligence can be attributed to heredity or to upbringing — this is the nature and nurture controversy . Although many details remain to be settled , neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important . Genes determine the general form of the brain , and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience . Experience , however , is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections , which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does . In some respects , all that matters is the presence or absence of experience during critical periods of development . In other respects , the quantity and quality of experience are important ; for example , there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral <unk> , indicating a higher density of synaptic connections , than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted . 
 = = Physiology = = 
 The functions of the brain depend on the ability of neurons to transmit electrochemical signals to other cells , and their ability to respond appropriately to electrochemical signals received from other cells . The electrical properties of neurons are controlled by a wide variety of biochemical and metabolic processes , most notably the interactions between neurotransmitters and receptors that take place at synapses . 
 = = = Neurotransmitters and receptors = = = 
 Neurotransmitters are chemicals that are released at synapses when an action potential activates them — neurotransmitters attach themselves to receptor molecules on the membrane of the synapse 's target cell , and thereby alter the electrical or chemical properties of the receptor molecules . With few exceptions , each neuron in the brain releases the same chemical neurotransmitter , or combination of neurotransmitters , at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons ; this rule is known as Dale 's principle . Thus , a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases . The great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems . This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids , nicotine , heroin , cocaine , alcohol , fluoxetine , chlorpromazine , and many others . 
 The two neurotransmitters that are used most widely in the vertebrate brain are glutamate , which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons , and gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , which is almost always inhibitory . Neurons using these transmitters can be found in nearly every part of the brain . Because of their ubiquity , drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects . Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate ; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA . 
 There are dozens of other chemical neurotransmitters that are used in more limited areas of the brain , often areas dedicated to a particular function . Serotonin , for example — the primary target of antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids — comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the <unk> nuclei . Norepinephrine , which is involved in arousal , comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the locus coeruleus . Other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple sources in the brain , but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and GABA . 
 = = = Electrical activity = = = 
 As a side effect of the electrochemical processes used by neurons for signaling , brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active . When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity , the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull , using electroencephalography ( EEG ) or magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) . EEG recordings , along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats , show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active , even during sleep . Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity , which may vary according to behavioral state . In mammals , the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep , faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive , and chaotic @-@ looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task . During an epileptic seizure , the brain 's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels , producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain . Relating these population @-@ level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology . 
 = = = Metabolism = = = 
 All vertebrates have a blood – brain barrier that allows metabolism inside the brain to operate differently from metabolism in other parts of the body . Glial cells play a major role in brain metabolism by controlling the chemical composition of the fluid that surrounds neurons , including levels of ions and nutrients . 
 Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume , so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals . The need to limit body weight in order , for example , to fly , has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species , such as bats . Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher — in humans it rises to 20 – 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and <unk> . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen @-@ dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. , blood sugar ) , but ketones provide a major alternative source , together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( <unk> and <unk> acids ) , lactate , acetate , and possibly amino acids . 
 = = Functions = = 
 From an evolutionary @-@ biological perspective , the function of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal . A centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be co @-@ activated in complex patterns ; it also allows stimuli impinging on one part of the body to evoke responses in other parts , and it can prevent different parts of the body from acting at cross @-@ purposes to each other . 
 To generate purposeful and unified action , the brain first brings information from sense organs together at a central location . It then processes this raw data to extract information about the structure of the environment . Next it combines the processed sensory information with information about the current needs of an animal and with memory of past circumstances . Finally , on the basis of the results , it generates motor response patterns that are suited to maximize the welfare of the animal . These signal @-@ processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems . 
 = = = Information processing = = = 
 The invention of electronic computers in the 1940s , along with the development of mathematical information theory , led to a realization that brains can potentially be understood as information processing systems . This concept formed the basis of the field of cybernetics , and eventually gave rise to the field now known as computational neuroscience . The earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in that they treated the brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise , as for example in John von Neumann 's 1958 book , The Computer and the Brain . Over the years , though , accumulating information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism . 
 The essence of the information processing approach is to try to understand brain function in terms of information flow and implementation of algorithms . One of the most influential early contributions was a 1959 paper titled What the frog 's eye tells the frog 's brain : the paper examined the visual responses of neurons in the retina and optic tectum of frogs , and came to the conclusion that some neurons in the tectum of the frog are wired to combine elementary responses in a way that makes them function as " bug <unk> " . A few years later David <unk> and Torsten Wiesel discovered cells in the primary visual cortex of monkeys that become active when sharp edges move across specific points in the field of view — a discovery for which they won a Nobel Prize . Follow @-@ up studies in higher @-@ order visual areas found cells that detect binocular disparity , color , movement , and aspects of shape , with areas located at increasing distances from the primary visual cortex showing increasingly complex responses . Other investigations of brain areas unrelated to vision have revealed cells with a wide variety of response correlates , some related to memory , some to abstract types of cognition such as space . 
 Theorists have worked to understand these response patterns by constructing mathematical models of neurons and neural networks , which can be simulated using computers . Some useful models are abstract , focusing on the conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than the details of how they are implemented in the brain ; other models attempt to incorporate data about the biophysical properties of real neurons . No model on any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function , though . The essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed processing in which hundreds or thousands of neurons work cooperatively — current methods of brain activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time . 
 Furthermore , even single neurons appear to be complex and capable of performing computations . So , brain models that don 't reflect this are arguably too <unk> to be representative of brain operation ; models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational resources . However , having said this , the Human Brain Project is trying to build a realistic , detailed computational model of the entire human brain . It remains to be seen what level of success they can achieve in the time frame of the project and the wisdom of it has been publicly contested , with high @-@ profile scientists on both sides of the argument . 
 = = = Perception = = = 
 One of the primary functions of a brain is to extract biologically relevant information from sensory inputs . The human brain is provided with information about light , sound , the chemical composition of the atmosphere , temperature , head orientation , limb position , the chemical composition of the bloodstream , and more . In other animals additional senses may be present , such as the infrared heat @-@ sense of snakes , the magnetic field sense of some birds , or the electric field sense of some types of fish . Moreover , other animals may develop existing sensory systems in new ways , such as the adaptation by bats of the auditory sense into a form of sonar . One way or another , all of these sensory modalities are initially detected by specialized sensors that project signals into the brain . 
 Each sensory system begins with specialized receptor cells , such as light @-@ receptive neurons in the retina of the eye , vibration @-@ sensitive neurons in the cochlea of the ear , or pressure @-@ sensitive neurons in the skin . The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into the spinal cord or brain , where they transmit their signals to a first @-@ order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality . This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher @-@ order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality . Eventually , via a way @-@ station in the thalamus , the signals are sent to the cerebral cortex , where they are processed to extract biologically relevant features , and integrated with signals coming from other sensory systems . 
 = = = Motor control = = = 
 Motor systems are areas of the brain that are directly or indirectly involved in producing body movements , that is , in activating muscles . Except for the muscles that control the eye , which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain , all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain . Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord , and by inputs that descend from the brain . The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses , and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming . The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control . 
 The brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord . At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons , which control stereotyped movements such as walking , breathing , or swallowing . At a higher level are areas in the midbrain , such as the red nucleus , which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs . At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex , a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe . The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas , but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord , through the pyramidal tract . This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements . Other motor @-@ related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas . Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex , basal ganglia , and cerebellum . 
 In addition to all of the above , the brain and spinal cord contain extensive circuitry to control the autonomic nervous system , which works by secreting hormones and by modulating the " smooth " muscles of the gut . The autonomic nervous system affects heart rate , digestion , respiration rate , salivation , perspiration , urination , and sexual arousal , and several other processes . Most of its functions are not under direct voluntary control . 
 = = = Arousal = = = 
 Perhaps the most obvious aspect of the behavior of any animal is the daily cycle between sleeping and waking . Arousal and alertness are also modulated on a finer time scale , though , by an extensive network of brain areas . 
 A key component of the arousal system is the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) , a tiny part of the hypothalamus located directly above the point at which the optic nerves from the two eyes cross . The SCN contains the body 's central biological clock . Neurons there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours , circadian rhythms : these activity fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of " clock genes " . The SCN continues to keep time even if it is excised from the brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution , but it ordinarily receives input from the optic nerves , through the <unk> tract ( <unk> ) , that allows daily light @-@ dark cycles to calibrate the clock . 
 The SCN projects to a set of areas in the hypothalamus , brainstem , and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep @-@ wake cycles . An important component of the system is the reticular formation , a group of neuron @-@ clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain . <unk> neurons send signals to the thalamus , which in turn sends activity @-@ level @-@ controlling signals to every part of the cortex . Damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma . 
 Sleep involves great changes in brain activity . Until the 1950s it was generally believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep , but this is now known to be far from true ; activity continues , but patterns become very different . There are two types of sleep : REM sleep ( with dreaming ) and NREM ( non @-@ REM , usually without dreaming ) sleep , which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode . Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured : REM , light NREM and deep NREM . During deep NREM sleep , also called slow wave sleep , activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves , whereas in the waking state it is noisy and <unk> . Levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep , and fall almost to zero during REM sleep ; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern . 
 = = = Homeostasis = = = 
 For any animal , survival requires maintaining a variety of parameters of bodily state within a limited range of variation : these include temperature , water content , salt concentration in the bloodstream , blood glucose levels , blood oxygen level , and others . The ability of an animal to regulate the internal environment of its body — the milieu intérieur , as pioneering physiologist Claude Bernard called it — is known as homeostasis ( Greek for " standing still " ) . Maintaining homeostasis is a crucial function of the brain . The basic principle that underlies homeostasis is negative feedback : any time a parameter diverges from its set @-@ point , sensors generate an error signal that evokes a response that causes the parameter to shift back toward its optimum value . ( This principle is widely used in engineering , for example in the control of temperature using a thermostat . ) 
 In vertebrates , the part of the brain that plays the greatest role is the hypothalamus , a small region at the base of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function . The hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei , most of which are involved in basic biological functions . Some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality , aggression , or maternal behaviors ; but many of them relate to homeostasis . Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels , conveying information about temperature , sodium level , glucose level , blood oxygen level , and other parameters . These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies . Some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland , a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus . The pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream , where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity . 
 = = = Motivation = = = 
 According to evolutionary theory , individuals are genetically programmed to behave in ways that ensure survival and reproductive success . This overarching goal of genetic fitness translates into a set of specific survival @-@ promoting behaviors , such as seeking food , water , shelter , and a mate . The motivational system in the brain monitors the current state of satisfaction of these goals , and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise . The motivational system works largely by a reward – punishment mechanism . When a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences , the reward mechanism in the brain is activated , which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same behavior to be repeated later , whenever a similar situation arises . Conversely , when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences , the brain 's punishment mechanism is activated , inducing structural changes that cause the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future . 
 Most organisms studied to date utilize a reward – punishment mechanism : for instance , worms and insects can alter their behavior to seek food sources or to avoid dangers . In vertebrates , the reward @-@ punishment system is implemented by a specific set of brain structures , at the heart of which lie the basal ganglia , a set of interconnected areas at the base of the forebrain . There is substantial evidence that the basal ganglia are the central site at which decisions are made : the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain ; when this inhibition is released , a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out . Rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal ganglia receive and the decision @-@ signals that are emitted . The reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism , because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively . Research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role : addictive drugs such as cocaine , amphetamine , and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced . 
 = = = Learning and memory = = = 
 Almost all animals are capable of modifying their behavior as a result of experience — even the most primitive types of worms . Because behavior is driven by brain activity , changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain . Theorists dating back to Santiago Ramón y Cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons . Until 1970 , however , experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking . In 1971 Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long @-@ term potentiation : the paper showed clear evidence of activity @-@ induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days . Since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out , and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change , and uncovered other types of activity @-@ driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas , including the cerebral cortex , hippocampus , basal ganglia , and cerebellum . Brain @-@ derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process . 
 <unk> currently distinguish several types of learning and memory that are implemented by the brain in distinct ways : 
 Working memory is the ability of the brain to maintain a temporary representation of information about the task that an animal is currently engaged in . This sort of dynamic memory is thought to be mediated by the formation of cell assemblies — groups of activated neurons that maintain their activity by constantly stimulating one another . 
 Episodic memory is the ability to remember the details of specific events . This sort of memory can last for a lifetime . Much evidence implicates the hippocampus in playing a crucial role : people with severe damage to the hippocampus sometimes show amnesia , that is , inability to form new long @-@ lasting episodic memories . 
 Semantic memory is the ability to learn facts and relationships . This sort of memory is probably stored largely in the cerebral cortex , mediated by changes in connections between cells that represent specific types of information . 
 Instrumental learning is the ability for rewards and punishments to modify behavior . It is implemented by a network of brain areas centered on the basal ganglia . 
 Motor learning is the ability to refine patterns of body movement by practicing , or more generally by repetition . A number of brain areas are involved , including the premotor cortex , basal ganglia , and especially the cerebellum , which functions as a large memory bank for <unk> of the parameters of movement .

 The field of neuroscience encompasses all approaches that seek to understand the brain and the rest of the nervous system . Psychology seeks to understand mind and behavior , and neurology is the medical discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of the nervous system . The brain is also the most important organ studied in psychiatry , the branch of medicine that works to study , prevent , and treat mental disorders . Cognitive science seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain , such as computer science ( artificial intelligence and similar fields ) and philosophy . 
 The oldest method of studying the brain is anatomical , and until the middle of the 20th century , much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes . <unk> study the large @-@ scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components , especially synapses . Among other tools , they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure , chemistry , and connectivity . In recent years , the development of <unk> techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes . Also , functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior . 
 <unk> study the chemical , pharmacological , and electrical properties of the brain : their primary tools are drugs and recording devices . Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system , some in highly specific ways . Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes , either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies , or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings , which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons . Because the brain does not contain pain receptors , it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress . The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy , in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures . Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity ; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects , because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time , but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive . 
 Another approach to brain function is to examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas . Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges , surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid , and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood – brain barrier , the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage . In humans , the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function . Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage , however , this information is often difficult to interpret . In animal studies , most commonly involving rats , it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior . 
 Computational neuroscience encompasses two approaches : first , the use of computers to study the brain ; second , the study of how brains perform computation . On one hand , it is possible to write a computer program to simulate the operation of a group of neurons by making use of systems of equations that describe their electrochemical activity ; such simulations are known as biologically realistic neural networks . On the other hand , it is possible to study algorithms for neural computation by simulating , or mathematically analyzing , the operations of simplified " units " that have some of the properties of neurons but abstract out much of their biological complexity . The computational functions of the brain are studied both by computer scientists and neuroscientists . 
 Recent years have seen increasing applications of genetic and genomic techniques to the study of the brain and a focus on the roles of neurotrophic factors and physical activity in neuroplasticity . The most common subjects are mice , because of the availability of technical tools . It is now possible with relative ease to " knock out " or mutate a wide variety of genes , and then examine the effects on brain function . More sophisticated approaches are also being used : for example , using <unk> @-@ Lox recombination it is possible to activate or deactivate genes in specific parts of the brain , at specific times .

 The oldest brain to have been discovered was in Armenia in the <unk> @-@ 1 cave complex . The brain , estimated to be over 5 @,@ 000 years old , was found in the skull of a 12 to 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl . Although the brains were shriveled , they were well preserved due to the climate found inside the cave . 
 Early philosophers were divided as to whether the seat of the soul lies in the brain or heart . Aristotle favored the heart , and thought that the function of the brain was merely to cool the blood . Democritus , the inventor of the atomic theory of matter , argued for a three @-@ part soul , with intellect in the head , emotion in the heart , and lust near the liver . Hippocrates , the " father of medicine " , came down unequivocally in favor of the brain . In his treatise on epilepsy he wrote : 
 Men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain come joys , delights , laughter and sports , and sorrows , griefs , despondency , and lamentations . ... And by the same organ we become mad and delirious , and fears and terrors assail us , some by night , and some by day , and dreams and untimely wanderings , and cares that are not suitable , and ignorance of present circumstances , desuetude , and <unk> . All these things we endure from the brain , when it is not healthy ... 
 Hippocrates , On the Sacred Disease 
 The Roman physician Galen also argued for the importance of the brain , and theorized in some depth about how it might work . Galen traced out the anatomical relationships among brain , nerves , and muscles , demonstrating that all muscles in the body are connected to the brain through a branching network of nerves . He postulated that nerves activate muscles mechanically by carrying a mysterious substance he called <unk> <unk> , usually translated as " animal spirits " . Galen 's ideas were widely known during the Middle Ages , but not much further progress came until the Renaissance , when detailed anatomical study resumed , combined with the theoretical speculations of René Descartes and those who followed him . Descartes , like Galen , thought of the nervous system in hydraulic terms . He believed that the highest cognitive functions are carried out by a non @-@ physical res cogitans , but that the majority of behaviors of humans , and all behaviors of animals , could be explained mechanistically . 
 The first real progress toward a modern understanding of nervous function , though , came from the investigations of Luigi Galvani , who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract . Since that time , each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from the development of a new technique of investigation . Until the early years of the 20th century , the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells . Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi stain , which ( when correctly used ) stains only a small fraction of neurons , but stains them in their entirety , including cell body , dendrites , and axon . Without such a stain , brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers , in which it is impossible to determine any structure . In the hands of Camillo Golgi , and especially of the Spanish <unk> Santiago Ramón y Cajal , the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons , each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity . 
 In the first half of the 20th century , advances in electronics enabled investigation of the electrical properties of nerve cells , culminating in work by Alan Hodgkin , Andrew Huxley , and others on the biophysics of the action potential , and the work of Bernard Katz and others on the electrochemistry of the synapse . These studies complemented the anatomical picture with a conception of the brain as a dynamic entity . Reflecting the new understanding , in 1942 Charles Sherrington visualized the workings of the brain waking from sleep : 
 The great topmost sheet of the mass , that where hardly a light had twinkled or moved , becomes now a sparkling field of rhythmic flashing points with trains of traveling sparks hurrying hither and thither . The brain is waking and with it the mind is returning . It is as if the Milky Way entered upon some cosmic dance . Swiftly the head mass becomes an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern , always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding one ; a shifting harmony of <unk> . 
 — Sherrington , 1942 , Man on his Nature 
 In the second half of the 20th century , developments in chemistry , electron microscopy , genetics , computer science , functional brain imaging , and other fields progressively opened new windows into brain structure and function . In the United States , the 1990s were officially designated as the " Decade of the Brain " to commemorate advances made in brain research , and to promote funding for such research . 
 In the 21st century , these trends have continued , and several new approaches have come into prominence , including <unk> recording , which allows the activity of many brain cells to be recorded all at the same time ; genetic engineering , which allows molecular components of the brain to be altered experimentally ; genomics , which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in DNA properties and neuroimaging . 
 = New York State Route 393 = 
 New York State Route 393 ( NY 393 ) was an east – west state highway in Tompkins County , New York , in the United States . It was a spur route that connected the downtown district of the city of Ithaca to the Ithaca – Dryden town line . The western terminus of the route was at an intersection with NY 13 ( modern NY 366 ) in East Ithaca . Its eastern terminus was at Game Farm Road , a local road that straddled the boundary between the towns of Ithaca and Dryden . 
 NY 393 was assigned in the early 1930s as a signed designation for a highway that the state of New York had assumed maintenance of in the 1910s . It originally extended west along Mitchell Street to NY 79 , but was truncated to Ithaca Road when NY 13 was rerouted through Ithaca in the mid @-@ 1930s . The NY 393 designation was removed in the mid @-@ 1960s , and its former routing is now maintained by the city of Ithaca and Tompkins County . The designation is currently reserved by the New York State Department of Transportation for a highway in Chautauqua County . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 393 began at the intersection of Mitchell Street and Ithaca Road in the city of Ithaca . Here , NY 13 turned off Mitchell Street to follow Ithaca Road while NY 393 continued eastward on Mitchell Street . It passed through the community of East Ithaca and entered the surrounding town of Ithaca . In the town of Ithaca , NY 393 intersected Pine Tree Road ( County Route 174 or CR 174 ) and passed through areas with varying levels of development before ending at Game Farm Road , here marking the boundary between the towns of Ithaca and Dryden . The roadway continued eastward into Dryden as a locally maintained highway .

 The portion of Mitchell Street and Ellis Hollow Road from the city of Ithaca to the Ithaca – Dryden town line had existed as early as 1900 . In the early 1910s , the state of New York helped finance improvements to the portion of the highway within the town of Ithaca . The highway was added to the state highway system in late October 1914 . In 1916 , construction began on an upgrade of Mitchell Street in Ithaca , again partially paid for by the state of New York . All of Mitchell Street was accepted into the state highway system on August 31 , 1917 . 
 The state @-@ maintained portion of Mitchell Street and Ellis Hollow Road was designated as NY 393 c . 1933 . The route began at NY 79 ( State Street ) in Ithaca and ended at the Dryden town line , where the road continued east as a local highway . NY 13 was realigned through Ithaca c . 1936 to bypass the campus of Cornell University to the south along Dryden Road , Ithaca Road , and Mitchell Street . As a result , NY 393 was truncated slightly to begin at the junction of Ithaca Road and Mitchell Street . NY 393 remained unchanged until the mid @-@ 1960s when it was removed from the state highway system . The portion of NY 393 's former routing in the city of Ithaca is now city @-@ maintained while the remainder of the highway in the town of Ithaca is now part of CR 110 . 
 The NY 393 designation is currently reserved by the New York State Department of Transportation for a proposed " Chautauqua <unk> " in Chautauqua County between Interstate 86 / NY 17 and NY 5 . No timetable exists for the <unk> 's construction nor for NY 393 's reassignment .

 = The Casbah Coffee Club = 
 The Casbah Coffee Club was a rock and roll music venue in West Derby , Liverpool , England started by Mona Best in 1959 in the cellar of the family home . The Casbah , as it became widely known , was planned as a members @-@ only club for Best 's sons Pete , his younger brother , Rory , and their friends . Mona came up with the idea of the club after watching a TV report about The 2i 's Coffee Bar in London 's Soho where several singers had been discovered . She decided to open the club , which was located in her cellar , on 29 August 1959 , for her sons , their friends and young people to meet and listen to the popular music of the day . 
 The Quarrymen — John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison , and Ken Brown — went to the club to arrange their first booking , to which Mona agreed , but said she needed to finish painting the club first . All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders , dragons , rainbows and stars . In addition to the four boys ' artistic contributions , Cynthia Powell , later to become Cynthia Lennon , painted a silhouette of John on the wall , which can still be seen today . The group often played at The Casbah as other venues , like The Cavern Club , had a jazz @-@ only policy at that time . The cellar — with its original decoration — still exists . 
 In 2006 , Culture Minister David Lammy announced that the Bests ' ex @-@ coal cellar was to be given Grade II listed building status and a blue plaque , after being recommended by English Heritage . It was opened as a tourist attraction in Liverpool , along with McCartney and Lennon 's previous homes at 20 Forthlin Road and 251 Menlove Avenue respectively .

 Mona Shaw was born on 3 January 1924 , in Delhi , and married John Best in India before moving with him and their two children , Pete Best ( b . 1941 ) and Rory Best ( b . 1944 ) back to Liverpool in 1945 , where they lived in various houses . After moving to Queenscourt Road in 1948 — where the Bests lived for nine years — Mona was told by Rory about a large Victorian house for sale at 8 Hayman 's Green , in 1954 . The Best family claim that Mona then pawned all her jewellery and placed a bet on a horse that was ridden by Lester Piggott in the 1954 Epsom Derby called , " Never Say Die " , which won at 33 @-@ 1 , and used her winnings to buy the house in 1957 ( to place the bet , Mona would have had to travel more than 220 miles ( 350 km ) from Liverpool to Epsom - as bets were only allowed at race tracks at the time - or placed the bet with an illegal bookmaker in Liverpool ) . The house ( built around 1860 by an unknown architect ) , had previously been owned by the West Derby Conservative Club , and was unlike many other family dwellings in Liverpool , as it was set back from the road , had 15 bedrooms and 1 acre ( 4 @,@ 000 m2 ) of land . All the rooms were painted dark green or brown , the garden was totally overgrown , and the cellar was used for storing coal .

 Mona came up with the idea of the club after watching a TV report about The 2i 's Coffee Bar in London 's Soho , where several singers had been discovered . She decided to open the club , which was located in her cellar , on 29 August 1959 , for her sons , their friends and young people to meet and listen to the popular music of the day , unlike The Cavern Club , which had a jazz @-@ only policy at that time . Mona charged half a crown annually for membership — to " keep out the rough elements " — and served soft drinks , snacks , cakes , and coffee from an espresso machine , which no other club had at that time . Records were played on a small <unk> record player , which amplified them through a 3 " speaker . Mona had booked the Les Stewart Quartet to play the opening night with Harrison on guitar , but they cancelled the booking after Stewart and Ken Brown had a quarrel . Stewart was angry that Brown had missed a rehearsal , because Brown was helping Mona to decorate the club . As 300 membership cards had already been sold , Harrison said that he had two friends in a band called The Quarrymen who would play instead . Lennon , McCartney and Harrison went to the club to arrange the booking , to which Mona agreed , but said she needed to finish painting the club first . All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders , dragons , rainbows and stars , but as Lennon was short @-@ sighted , he mistook gloss for emulsion paint , which took a long time to dry in the dark , damp cellar . Cynthia Powell , later the wife of Lennon , painted a silhouette of him on the wall , which is also still there . 
 The Quarrymen played a series of seven Saturday night concerts in The Casbah for 15 shillings each , starting on 29 August to October 1959 , featuring Lennon , McCartney , Harrison and Brown , but without a drummer , and only one microphone connected to the club 's small PA system . The opening night concert was attended by about 300 local teenagers , but as the cellar had no air @-@ conditioning , and people were dancing , the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe . After the success of the first night , Mona gave The Quarrymen a residency , and paid the whole group £ 3 a night . Every Saturday thereafter , queues lengthened onto the street , which was financially good for Mona , as she charged one shilling admission on top of the annual membership fee . As there was no amplification , Lennon later persuaded Mona to hire a young amateur guitar player called Harry to play a short set before The Quarrymen , but this was only so they could use his 40 @-@ Watt amplifier . 
 Best was studying at the Collegiate Grammar School when he decided he wanted to be in a music group , so Mona bought him a drum kit from Blackler 's music store and Best formed his own band ; The Black Jacks , who later played in The Casbah . Chas Newby joined the group , as did Ken Brown , but only after he had left The Quarrymen . The reason for Brown 's exit from the group was that he turned up on the seventh Saturday night of The Quarrymen residency at The Casbah with the flu , so Mona ordered him upstairs to the Best 's living room to rest . This caused a massive quarrel with the rest of the group when Mona came to pay them , as they wanted Brown 's money to be shared amongst the three of them , as Brown had not played . Mona refused , so The Quarrymen angrily cancelled their residency and stormed out . 
 Colin Manley from The Remo Four was also given a booking to play in the club , which was the only venue that young amateur bands could play at the time . Other artists and groups like Cilla Black , Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , The Searchers and Gerry & The Pacemakers later played in the club . The Black Jacks became the resident group at The Casbah , although The Quarrymen occasionally played there again and often visited . It was in The Casbah Club that Lennon and McCartney persuaded Stuart Sutcliffe to buy a Höfner 500 / 5 model — known in Europe as a President bass — with the money he had won in the John Moores art exhibition . Even though the membership list later spiralled to over a thousand , Mona closed the club on 24 June 1962 , with The Beatles as the last group to perform .

 Herbert Bernard Loper ( 22 October 1896 – 25 August 1989 ) was a United States Army major general who helped plan the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the Okinawa campaign during World War II . He was chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project from 1952 to 1953 , and Chairman of the Military Liaison Committee of the United States Atomic Energy Commission from 1954 to 1961 . 
 A graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point , he was commissioned in the US Army Corps of Engineers in 1919 . He graduated from the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas in 1940 , and became Assistant Chief , and later Chief , of the Intelligence Division at the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington , DC . In May 1942 , he negotiated the Loper @-@ Hotline Agreement , under which responsibility for military mapping and survey of the globe was divided between the United States and the United Kingdom . In 1944 , he was appointed Chief Engineer of US Army Forces , Pacific Ocean Areas . In this role he was involved with the planning of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the Okinawa campaign . After the fighting ended , he participated in the Occupation of Japan . 
 Loper returned to the United States to become Chief of the Joint Photo and Survey Section of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 's Joint Intelligence Group in 1948 . The next year he was appointed as an Army member of the Military Liaison Committee of the United States Atomic Energy Commission . He wrote a report which became known as the Loper Memorandum , which was influential in the decision to develop thermonuclear weapons . He was Deputy Commander of Joint Task Force 3 , which was responsible for the conduct the Operation Greenhouse nuclear tests in the Pacific . In 1951 became Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project , but was forced to retire after he suffered a heart attack in 1953 . He subsequently served as Chairman of the Military Liaison Committee from 2 August 1954 to 14 July 1961 .

 Herbert Bernard Loper was born in <unk> , Kansas on 22 October 1896 , the son of Gilford ( Gilbert ) Lafayette Loper and Hulda Belle Scott . He graduated from Washburn College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1916 . 
 Loper was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point from Nebraska and entered on 14 June 1917 . However , due to World War I , the course was truncated and his class was graduated early on 1 November 1918 . He was ranked sixth in the class , two places behind Alfred Gruenther , and was commissioned as a second lieutenant . 
 After the Armistice with Germany ended the fighting in November 1918 , it was decided to have the 1918 class complete their studies . Loper therefore remained at West Point as a student officer until 11 June 1919 , when he again graduated , and was assigned to the US Army Corps of Engineers , as was normal for highly placed graduates . At this time , officers who had not served overseas were sent to Europe to tour the battlefields , and Loper visited battlefields in France , Belgium and Italy , as well as the Army of Occupation in Germany .

 Loper returned to the United States in September and was initially posted to Camp A.A. Humphreys , Virginia . He was promoted to first lieutenant on 16 October 1919 . In October , he was sent to 8th Engineers at Fort Bliss , Texas . He was stationed at Camp Travis , Texas until June 1920 , when he commenced studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , from which he graduated in August 1921 , with a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering . 
 Loper then became Military Assistant to the District Engineer at Jacksonville , Florida . He reverted to the rank of second lieutenant on 15 December 1922 , a common enough occurrence in the wake of the demobilization after World War I , but was again promoted to the rank of first lieutenant on 22 April 1923 . He married Eleanor Cameron Opie in 1922 . 
 In October 1923 , Loper was posted to the 11th Engineers in the Panama Canal Zone . He returned to the United States in December 1926 and was with the Engineer Reproduction Plant at the Army War College until 31 August 1929 . He then went back to Camp A. A. Humphreys , first as a student , and then , 1 September 1930 , as an instructor . In December 1933 , he became Assistant to the District Engineer at Omaha , Nebraska , where he was promoted to captain on 25 May 1935 . In February 1938 , he was posted to the 6th Engineers at Fort Lawton , Washington .

 Loper attended the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas from August 1939 to February 1940 . On graduation , he was posted to the 7th Engineer Battalion at Fort McClellan , Alabama . He was Assistant Chief of Staff , G @-@ 3 , and then Assistant Chief of Staff , G @-@ 4 , of the 5th Infantry Division . In June 1940 , he became Assistant Chief of the Intelligence Division at the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington , DC , and then chief . Here , he was promoted to major on 1 July 1940 , lieutenant colonel on 18 September 1941 , and colonel on 8 June 1942 . In May 1942 , he negotiated the Loper @-@ Hotline Agreement , under which responsibility for military mapping and survey of the globe was divided between the United States and the United Kingdom . The agreement also specified technical features such as grids , scales and formats , so Allied servicemen everywhere would have common maps . For his services in this post , he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal on 28 May 1944 . 
 On 28 May 1944 , Loper was appointed Chief Engineer of US Army Forces , Pacific Ocean Areas ( USAFPOA ) , on the specific request of the commander of USAFPOA , Lieutenant General Robert C. Richardson , Jr . Loper immediately became involved in planning for the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign . He discovered that the US Navy and Marine Corps did not have adequate map making units , so the task had to be undertaken by the Army . The 64th Topographic Battalion was assigned to the task of mapping the Caroline Islands and Palau . However , until B @-@ 29 photographic aircraft could be based in the Mariana Islands , much of the aerial survey had to be carried out by aircraft carrier @-@ based naval aircraft . Later Loper , who was promoted to brigadier general on 11 November 1944 , was involved in gathering engineer intelligence for the Battle of Iwo Jima , the Okinawa campaign , and Operation Olympic . When USAFPOA was merged with General of the Army Douglas MacArthur 's Southwest Pacific Area in 1945 , Loper became Chief of Engineer Intelligence under Major General Hugh J. Casey . After the fighting ended , Loper became Deputy Engineer of United States Far East Command during the Occupation of Japan . For his services in the Pacific , he was awarded the Legion of Merit on 22 September 1945 . He was awarded a second Legion of Merit for his services during the Occupation of Japan on 11 September 1948 .

 Loper returned to the United States in October 1948 , to become Chief of the Joint Photo and Survey Section of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 's Joint Intelligence Group . On 1 November 1949 , he was appointed as an Army member of the Military Liaison Committee of the United States Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) . Following the revelation of the espionage activities of Klaus Fuchs in 1950 , Loper and the Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project , Major General Kenneth D. Nichols , were asked to write a report on the impact of Klaus ' activities . Their pessimistic report pessimistically concluded that Soviet Union 's nuclear stockpile and production capacity could well be " equal or actually superior to our own , both as to yields and numbers . " They added that the Soviets might develop , or had already developed , thermonuclear weapon . The Loper Memorandum , as it became known , was influential in persuading the Joint Chiefs , the Secretary of Defense , and ultimately the President to authorize a crash program to develop thermonuclear weapons . 
 In 1951 , Loper was Deputy Commander of Joint Task Force 3 , which was responsible for the conduct the Operation Greenhouse nuclear tests in the Pacific . In 1951 , he succeeded Nichols as Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project . Nichols considered that Loper was " a very capable engineer , easygoing but firm , and well liked by his associates . " However , his term in the post was cut short in 1953 when he suffered a heart attack , and he was ultimately forced to retire from the Army in 1955 . However , he served as Chairman of the Military Liaison Committee from 2 August 1954 to 14 July 1961 . He was also a consultant to the AEC and the Secretary of Defense .

 Gerald Samuel Lesser ( August 22 , 1926 – September 23 , 2010 ) was an American psychologist who served on the faculty of Harvard University from 1963 until his retirement in 1998 . Lesser was one of the chief advisers to the Children 's Television Workshop ( CTW , later known as the Sesame Workshop ) in the development and content of the educational programming included in the children 's television program Sesame Street . At Harvard , he was chair of the university 's Human Development Program for 20 years , which focused on cross @-@ cultural studies of child rearing , and studied the effects of media on young children . In 1974 , he wrote Children and Television : Lessons From Sesame Street , which chronicled how Sesame Street was developed and put on the air . Lesser developed many of the research methods the CTW used throughout its history and for other TV shows . In 1968 , before the debut of Sesame Street , he led a series of content seminars , an important part of the " CTW Model " , which incorporated educational pedagogy and research into TV scripts and was used to develop other educational programs and organizations all over the world .

After two years at Columbia University , he served in the United States Navy during World War II and returned to finish his undergraduate degree and earn a master 's in psychology at Columbia . He earned a Ph.D. from Yale University in child development and psychology in 1952 , studying the effects of visual media on children and the design of educational programming . He married Stella Scharf in 1953 . 
 Lesser taught education at Adelphi University and Hunter College , until hired by the Harvard School of Education ( HSE ) in 1963 , where he taught developmental psychology and its application to education . He was also chair of Harvard 's Human Development Program for 20 years , which focused on cross @-@ cultural studies of child rearing and was responsible for recruiting developmental psychologists and cultural anthropologists who influenced the studies of child development and education in the U.S. The HSE honored Lesser with a professorship , the Gerald S. Lesser Professor in Early Childhood Development ; former Harvard dean Kathleen McCartney was a recipient . Lesser retired in 1998 , and was a professor emeritus at Harvard until his death . Lesser 's colleagues reported that he had a big impact on his students and colleagues . Even though he worked all over the world , he remained dedicated to his students and " remained an integral presence in the lives of his graduate students " . 
 Lesser was one of the first scholars to study the effect of television on young children . He was hired in 1961 by NBC as an educational consultant for the TV show Exploring , which was created in response to Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) chairman Newton Minow 's charge to the networks to create more quality shows for children . Lesser studied how Exploring helped children learn in order to help the producers improve it , observed children while they watched it , and was able to see how TV shows were produced . Lesser 's experiences at NBC led to his involvement with the development of Sesame Street . 
 In 1964 , Lesser wrote , with Gordon Fifer and Donald H. Clark , Mental Abilities of Children in Different Social and Cultural Groups . Random House published his 1974 book Children and Television : Lessons From Sesame Street , which was called a " how @-@ to " in creating and producing a children 's television show , and was an account of the hard work and dedication required to put Sesame Street on the air .

 In 1967 , Lesser was asked to help develop and lead the research department of the newly formed Children 's Television Workshop ( CTW , later the Sesame Workshop ) , the organization responsible for the production of Sesame Street and other educational television programs . He was invited by Carnegie Foundation vice @-@ president and Sesame Street co @-@ creator Lloyd Morrisett , whom he had met while they were both psychology students at Yale . At first , Lesser was skeptical about the new show 's potential and its ability to teach children ; according to Morrisett , " he took some convincing " . As Lesser later reported , he would be involved only if he was able to make a real contribution . When he saw that Morrisett and his co @-@ creator , Joan Ganz Cooney , were serious about developing goals and a curriculum for the new show , and that it would be an " experimental venture in education by television " , he became the first chairman of the CTW 's advisory board , a position he held from 1967 to 1997 . Lesser was skeptical about Cooney 's qualifications as CTW 's first CEO , although by the time he wrote Children and Television in 1974 , she stated in the book 's foreword , " ... I couldn 't begin to measure how proud I am to be Gerry Lesser 's colleague and how happy I am to know the pleasure of his company " . 
 According to The New York Times , Lesser " poured the pedagogy into [ Sesame Street ] , helping ensure from the start that the new , experimental venture in education by television would be both enjoyable and instructive " . Fellow CTW researchers Edward Palmer and Shalom M. Fisch credited Lesser , along with Cooney and Morrisett , as a main architect of the show , and stated that " its extensive use of innovative television techniques meant that it would be highly experimental in nature " . Lesser and Palmer developed many of the research methods used to study the show 's impact on children throughout the show 's history . According to Sesame Workshop CEO Gary Knell , Lesser " trail blazed a path for an entire industry " and " set the standard for education 's intersection with media " . Knell also stated that Lesser challenged the conventional wisdom of the time that television could not teach young children , and proved that " TV was something organic in itself ; it was a technological species that lived under its own rules of engagement " . 
 Beginning in June 1968 , the CTW conducted a series of seminars at Harvard and in Manhattan , which were led by Lesser . These seminars became an important aspect of " the CTW model " , which incorporated educational pedagogy and research into TV scripts and was used to develop other educational programs and organizations all over the world . The purpose of the seminars was to expose the production team and other filmmakers and illustrators involved in the creative aspects of the new show to scholars , educators , and experts , and to encourage that both groups work together to create a curriculum and goals for the new show . The production team was skeptical regarding the place of research and objective analysis in the production of a television show , but Lesser 's previous experience in television , his warm , informal , unpretentious , and collaborative manner , and his proficiency in leading the meetings , convinced them . CTW researcher Keith Mielke stated , " He was masterful at running meetings . He was never stiff and formal , but casual and friendly " . According to producer Sam Gibbon , despite the participants ' personalities , experiences , and dispositions , Lesser was the only reason the seminars were successful . Lesser set the meetings ' tone and agenda , and recruited the participants . He stated , " The message was clear ; we were there to work . No pretension was going to be allowed " . 
 Lesser never appeared on Sesame Street , but he did appear in the promotional films the CTW created to persuade television stations to air the program . He worked on other CTW shows , including 3 @-@ 2 @-@ 1 Contact , Square One TV , and <unk> , and was involved in developing versions of Sesame Street created in other countries .

 The Hawker P.1127 and the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel FGA.1 were the experimental and development aircraft that led to the Hawker Siddeley Harrier , the first vertical and / or short take @-@ off and landing ( V / STOL ) jet fighter @-@ bomber . Kestrel development began in 1957 , taking advantage of the Bristol Engine Company 's choice to invest in the creation of the Pegasus vectored @-@ thrust engine . Testing began in July 1960 and by the end of the year the aircraft had achieved both vertical take @-@ off and horizontal flight . The test program also explored the possibility of use upon aircraft carriers , landing on HMS Ark Royal in 1963 . The first three aircraft crashed during testing , one at the 1963 Paris Air Show . 
 Improvements to future development aircraft , such as swept wings and more powerful Pegasus engines , led to the development of the Kestrel . The Kestrel was evaluated by the Tri @-@ partite Evaluation Squadron , made up of military pilots from Britain , the United States , and West Germany . Later flights were conducted by the U.S. military and NASA . 
 Related work on a supersonic aircraft , the Hawker Siddeley P.1154 , was cancelled in 1965 . As a result , the P.1127 ( RAF ) , a variant more closely based on the Kestrel , was ordered into production that year , and named Harrier - the name originally intended for the P.1154 - in 1967 . The Harrier served with the UK and several nations , often as a carrier @-@ based aircraft .

 In 1957 , the Bristol Engine Company informed Sydney Camm of Hawker that they had a project to combine their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a <unk> fan jet . The original idea on which the engine , named Pegasus , was based came from Michel <unk> , a French aviation consultant . Several adaptions and enhancements were made by Bristol to reduce size and weight over <unk> 's original concept . Hawker took the planned Pegasus engine as a basis for a plane that could meet the current NATO specification for a Light Tactical Support Fighter to replace the Fiat <unk> Prior to the P.1127 project , Hawker Aviation had been working on a replacement for the Hawker Hunter — the Hawker <unk> However , the <unk> was cancelled shortly after the 1957 Defence White Paper , which advocated a policy shift away from manned aircraft and towards missiles . 
 By the end of 1958 , barely eighteen months after the start of the project , all the main features of the P.1127 were developed with one exception , the reaction control system - this was resolved by April 1959 . As the P.1127 had been developed at a time of deep UK defense cuts , Hawker had to seek commercial funding , and significant engine development funding came from the U.S. Wind tunnel tests conducted by NASA Langley Research Center using a sub @-@ scale model showed acceptable flight characteristics . Hawker test pilot Hugh Merewether went to the U.S. at NASA 's request to fly the Bell X @-@ 14 . In March 1959 , the company 's board of directors ( Hawker Siddeley then ) decided to privately fund two P.1127 prototypes . In late 1959 the British Ministry of Supply contracted for two P.1127 prototypes . 
 = = = P.1127 = = = 
 The first " P.1127 Prototype V / STOL Strike Aircraft " , serial XP831 , was delivered in July 1960 for static engine testing , and in October the Pegasus flight engine was made available . Prior to this Stanley Hooker had asked Camm " I suppose you are going to do some conventional flying first Sydney ? " and Camm replied " What for ? " Hooker said " Well you know , just to make sure the aeroplane is a nice aeroplane , and everything under control . " Camm replied , " Oh , Hawker aeroplanes are always beautiful , nothing wrong with a Hawker aeroplane , not going to bother with that . Vertical first time " . The first tethered flight took place at Dunsfold Aerodrome on the 21 October and free flight hover was achieved on 19 November , after which the first publicity photos were released . The second prototype , <unk> , made its first take off conventionally on 7 July 1961 . The two aircraft proceeded to close the gap between vertical take off and flight , which was achieved by 8 September 1961 . 
 Four more prototypes were ordered . Throughout this period improved Pegasus engines were being developed , with the Pegasus 3 being capable of 15 @,@ 000 lbf ( 67 kN ) of thrust . Apart from this , the first four aircraft were quite similar , but the fifth , <unk> , introduced the taller fin and tailplane anhedral later seen on the Harrier . The fourth machine was used in part to give the Hawker production test pilots P.1127 familiarisation . The first carrier vertical landing was performed by the first prototype on HMS Ark Royal in 1963 . The last P.1127 , XP984 , introduced the swept wing . It was eventually fitted with the 15 @,@ 000 lbf ( 66 @.@ 7 kN ) Pegasus 5 and functioned as the prototype Kestrel . 
 The first three <unk> crashed , the second and third during development . The first prototype ( XP831 ) crashed at the Paris Air Show in 1963 , caused by a speck of dirt in the air feed lines of the nozzle control motor causing the engine nozzles to stick , but the aircraft was fully repaired and resumed development flying . All the pilots involved survived . 
 = = = Kestrel FGA.1 = = = 
 Nine evaluation aircraft were ordered as the Kestrel FGA.1 , an improved version of the P.1127 , the first flying on 7 March 1964 . The Kestrel had fully swept wings and a larger tail than the early <unk> , and the fuselage was modified to take the larger 15 @,@ 000 lbf ( 85 kN ) Pegasus 5 engine as in the P.1127 / Kestrel prototype XP984 . Due to interest from the U.S. and Germany , the Tri @-@ partite Evaluation Squadron ( TES ) was formed on 15 October 1964 at RAF West Raynham , staffed by military test pilots from Britain , the United States and West Germany . 
 The Kestrel 's first flight was on 7 March 1964 . These equipped the Tripartite Evaluation Squadron formed at RAF West Raynham in Norfolk in March 1965 . The Evaluation pilots developed a typical sortie routine for the Kestrel of conducting short take @-@ offs ( STO ) and returning to base on vertical landings . This manner of operation ( STOVL ) was judged to be the optimal practice . Operating from rough airstrips was also trialled at nearby RAF Bircham Newton , where the aircraft proved adept at traversing boggy ground and taking off from a variety of temporary ground coverings . During testing one aircraft was lost when a pilot tried to do a rolling take @-@ off with the parking brake on ; the evaluations were finalised in November 1965 . 
 Six of the eight surviving evaluation aircraft ( the three allocated to the U.S. plus those allocated to Germany ) were transferred to the U.S. for evaluation by the Army , Air Force , and Navy as the XV @-@ 6A Kestrel . After Tri @-@ Service evaluation they were passed to the USAF for further evaluation at Edwards Air Force Base , except for two that were assigned to NASA . One of the two remaining British @-@ based Kestrels was attached to the Blind Landing Experimental Unit ( BLEU ) at RAE Bedford and the other , <unk> , went to Blackburn for modification to take the uprated Pegasus 6 engine . 
 In addition to some strengthening , there were alterations to the air intake , which had throughout the P.1127 and Kestrel series featured an inflatable lip to smooth the intake airflow when the aircraft was almost stationary . There were concerns about the service life of these devices , so they were replaced with conventional suction relief doors . Experience gained during naval testing on board the commando carrier HMS Bulwark in 1966 convinced project officers that less reactive materials would be substituted for all uses of magnesium in the Kestrel 's airframe , in any further prototypes and production aircraft . The Kestrel became the prototype for pre @-@ production Harriers . 
 = = = P.1127 ( RAF ) = = = 
 NATO requirement NBMR @-@ 3 specified a VTOL aircraft , but one with the performance of an aircraft such as the F @-@ 4 Phantom II along with VTOL capability . Hawker drafted the P.1150 , a supersonic P.1127 , and the P.1154 , which would meet NBMR @-@ 3 . The P.1154 was a winner of the NATO competition and prototype construction was already underway at the point of cancellation in 1965 . The French government withdrew shortly after its selection over the Dassault Mirage IIIV . The RAF then began looking at a simple upgrade of the Kestrel , and issued Requirement ASR 384 for a V / STOL ground attack jet , known as the P.1127 ( RAF ) . 
 In late 1965 , the RAF ordered six pre @-@ production P.1127 ( RAF ) aircraft . The first P.1127 ( RAF ) flew on 31 August 1966 . An order for 60 production aircraft was formally received by Hawker Aviation in early 1967 ; at this time the aircraft received the Harrier GR.1 designation . The Harrier became a successful aircraft in British service , and was exported to several nations , often seeing usage as a carrier @-@ based aircraft .

 = 1877 FA Cup Final = 
 The 1877 FA Cup Final was a football match between Wanderers and Oxford University on 24 March 1877 at Kennington Oval in London . It was the sixth final of the world 's oldest football competition , the Football Association Challenge Cup ( known in the modern era as the FA Cup ) . Wanderers were the reigning cup @-@ holders and had won the competition three times in total . Oxford had also previously won the tournament . Wanderers had reached the final without conceding a goal , defeating Cambridge University in the semi @-@ finals . Oxford had only played three matches in the five rounds prior to the final due to a combination of byes and opponents withdrawing . 
 Oxford took the lead in the final when Arthur Kinnaird , the Wanderers goalkeeper , stepped behind his goal @-@ line while holding the ball , thereby scoring an own goal . Wanderers equalised in the dying stages of the match and scored the winning goal in extra time . Oxford 's goal was struck from the official records after the match , but reinstated over a hundred years later .
