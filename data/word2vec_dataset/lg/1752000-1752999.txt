 In the synthesis of the nucleic acid RNA , adenosine derived from ATP is one of the four nucleotides incorporated directly into RNA molecules by RNA polymerases . The energy driving this polymerization comes from cleaving off a pyrophosphate ( two phosphate groups ) . The process is similar in DNA biosynthesis , except that ATP is reduced to the <unk> <unk> , before incorporation into DNA . 
 = = Amino acid activation in protein synthesis = = 
 Aminoacyl @-@ tRNA synthetase enzymes utilize ATP as an energy source to attach a tRNA molecule to its specific amino acid , forming an aminoacyl @-@ tRNA complex , ready for translation at ribosomes . The energy is made available by ATP hydrolysis to adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) as two phosphate groups are removed . Amino acid activation refers to the attachment of an amino acid to its Transfer RNA ( tRNA ) . Aminoacyl transferase binds Adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) to amino acid , PP is released . Aminoacyl transferase binds AMP @-@ amino acid to tRNA . The AMP is used in this step . 
 = = = Amino Acid Activation = = = 
 During amino acid activation the amino acids ( aa ) are attached to their corresponding tRNA . The coupling reactions are catalysed by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl @-@ tRNA synthetases ( named after the reaction product aminoacyl @-@ tRNA or aa @-@ tRNA ) . The coupling reaction proceeds in two steps : 
 aa + ATP aa @-@ AMP + PPi 
 aa @-@ AMP + tRNA aa @-@ tRNA + AMP 
 The amino acid is coupled to the penultimate nucleotide at the 3 ′ <unk> of the tRNA ( the A in the sequence CCA ) via an ester bond ( roll over in illustration ) . The formation of the ester bond conserves a considerable part of the energy from the activation reaction . This stored energy provides the majority of the energy needed for peptide bond formation during translation . 
 Each of the 20 amino acids are recognized by its specific aminoacyl @-@ tRNA synthetase . The synthetases are usually composed of one to four protein subunits . The enzymes vary considerably in structure although they all perform the same type of reaction by binding ATP , one specific amino acid and its corresponding tRNA . 
 The specificity of the amino acid activation is as critical for the translational accuracy as the correct matching of the codon with the anticodon . The reason is that the ribosome only sees the anticodon of the tRNA during translation . Thus , the ribosome will not be able to discriminate between tRNAs with the same anticodon but linked to different amino acids . 
 The error frequency of the amino acid activation reaction is approximately 1 in 10000 despite the small structural differences between some of the amino acids . 
 = = Binding to proteins = = 
 Some proteins that bind ATP do so in a characteristic protein fold known as the Rossmann fold , which is a general nucleotide @-@ binding structural domain that can also bind the coenzyme NAD . The most common ATP @-@ binding proteins , known as kinases , share a small number of common folds ; the protein kinases , the largest kinase superfamily , all share common structural features specialized for ATP binding and phosphate transfer . 
 ATP in complexes with proteins , in general , requires the presence of a divalent cation , almost always magnesium , which binds to the ATP phosphate groups . The presence of magnesium greatly decreases the dissociation constant of ATP from its protein binding partner without affecting the ability of the enzyme to catalyze its reaction once the ATP has bound . The presence of magnesium ions can serve as a mechanism for kinase regulation . 
 = = ATP analogues = = 
 Biochemistry laboratories often use in vitro studies to explore ATP @-@ dependent molecular processes . Enzyme inhibitors of ATP @-@ dependent enzymes such as kinases are needed to examine the binding sites and transition states involved in ATP @-@ dependent reactions . ATP analogs are also used in X @-@ ray crystallography to determine a protein structure in complex with ATP , often together with other substrates . Most useful ATP analogs cannot be hydrolyzed as ATP would be ; instead they trap the enzyme in a structure closely related to the ATP @-@ bound state . Adenosine 5 ′ - ( γ @-@ <unk> ) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma @-@ phosphate oxygens is replaced by a sulfur atom ; this molecule is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP @-@ dependent processes . In crystallographic studies , hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound vanadate ion . However , caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs , since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration . 
 = Robert Keyes = 
 Robert Keyes was a member of the group of provincial English Catholics who planned the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605 , a conspiracy to assassinate King James I by blowing up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament on 5 November 1605 . He was the sixth man to join the plot . 
 Unlike several other conspirators Keyes was not a particularly wealthy man . He was trusted by Robert Catesby , the plot 's author , with guarding the explosives stored at the latter 's lodgings in London . When the plot was uncovered he fled the city , and was captured several days later in Warwickshire . He was subsequently tried with his co @-@ conspirators , found guilty , and in January 1606 hanged , drawn and quartered . 
 = = Life before 1604 = = 
 Born in about 1565 , Robert Keyes was the son of the Protestant Rector of Staveley in North Derbyshire . His mother was a daughter of Sir Robert Tyrwhitt of <unk> in Lincolnshire , and related to the Catholic <unk> of <unk> . Keyes ' first cousin Elizabeth <unk> was married to another member of the plot , Ambrose Rookwood . By 1604 , Robert had converted to Catholicism . His wife Christina , a widow when he married her , was the governess for the children of Henry Mordaunt , 4th Baron Mordaunt , at Drayton in Northamptonshire , and for this Keyes gained the use of horses and other amenities . 
 = = Gunpowder Plot = = 
 English Catholics had hoped that the persecution of their faith would end when the apparently more tolerant King James I succeeded Queen Elizabeth I , but Robert Catesby , a Catholic zealot from Ashby St Ledgers , remained unimpressed by the new royal dynasty . He therefore planned to kill James by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder , following which he would help incite a popular revolt to install James 's daughter , Princess Elizabeth , as titular Queen . His role being to guard the gunpowder and other items stored at Catesby 's house in Lambeth , Keyes joined the conspiracy in October 1604 . 
 The Jesuit priest John Gerard described Keyes as " a grave and sober man , and of great wit and sufficiency " . Father Oswald Tesimond claimed that Keyes had " tasted persecution himself , having lost his goods because of it " while historian and author Cyril Northcote Parkinson 's image of him was of a " desperate man , ruined and indebted " . Tall , with a red beard , despite his relative poverty Catesby declared him " a trusty honest man " , and may have paid him for his services . Like fellow plotter Guy Fawkes , he was thought capable of looking after himself . Several conspirators expressed concerns about the safety of fellow Catholics who would be at Parliament on the day of the planned explosion ; Keyes was particularly worried about Lord Mordaunt , his wife 's employer . Thomas Percy was concerned for his patron , Henry Percy , 9th Earl of Northumberland , and the Lords Vaux , Montague , Monteagle and Stourton were also mentioned . Keyes 's suggestion to warn Lord Mordaunt was treated by Catesby with derision , when he answered that " he would not for the chamber full of diamonds acquaint him with the secret , for that he knew he could not keep it . " 
 Keyes and his cousin @-@ in @-@ law Ambrose Rookwood spent the night before the planned explosion at the house of an Elizabeth More , near Temple Bar . They were visited late that evening by Fawkes ( in charge of the explosives beneath the House of Lords ) who collected a watch left by Percy , for timing the fuse . Several hours later , however , Fawkes was discovered guarding the explosives , and arrested . 
 = = Failure and death = = 
 When Keyes heard that Fawkes had been captured he took to his horse and fled for the Midlands . He was overtaken at Highgate by Rookwood , who was rushing to inform Catesby and the others of what had transpired . After he and Rookwood had caught up with Catesby , Percy , Thomas Bates , and John and Christopher Wright , Keyes left the group , and headed instead for Lord Mordaunt 's house at Drayton , where he went to ground . He was identified as a suspect on 6 November , and captured several days later . 
 The conspirators were tried on 27 January 1606 at Westminster Hall . Despite entering pleas of not guilty ( only Digby professed his guilt ) , all eight were found guilty . They were each allowed to speak " wherefore judgement of death should not be pronounced against them " . Keyes made no attempt to excuse his actions , claiming that " death was as good now as at any other time " , preferable to living " in the midst of so much tyranny " . The Jesuit Oswald Tesimond wrote in his Narrative of Keyes 's defence : 
 He claimed that his motive had been to promote the common good . That is , he hoped that his native land would be turned back to the Catholic faith . The violence of the present persecution had driven him also to take part in the conspiracy . 
 On 31 January 1606 Keyes , Rookwood , Thomas Wintour and Fawkes were taken to the Old Palace Yard in Westminster , to be hanged , drawn and quartered . Rookwood and Wintour were the first to ascend to the gallows . Grim @-@ faced , Keyes went " stoutly " up the ladder , but with the halter around his neck he threw himself off , presumably hoping for a quick death . The halter broke , however , and he was taken to the block to suffer the remainder of his sentence . 
 = Dictum of Kenilworth = 
 The Dictum of Kenilworth , issued 31 October 1266 , was a pronouncement designed to reconcile the rebels of the Barons ' War with the royal government of England . After the baronial victory at the Battle of Lewes in 1264 , Simon de Montfort took control of royal government , but at the Battle of Evesham the next year Montfort was killed , and King Henry III restored to power . A group of rebels held out in the stronghold of Kenilworth Castle , however , and their resistance proved hard to crush . 
 A siege of the castle was started , but through papal intervention King Henry later entered on a more conciliatory path . A commission was appointed to draw up an arrangement that would be acceptable to both sides . The resulting Dictum of Kenilworth offered the rebels the right to buy back forfeited estates , at prices depending on their level of involvement in the rebellion . After initial resistance , the terms were eventually accepted . By the summer of 1267 , the country was pacified , and this spirit of reconciliation would last until the 1290s . The Dictum of Kenilworth was later incorporated into the Statute of Marlborough . 
 = = Background = = 
 At the Battle of Lewes in 1264 , the rebellious barons , led by Simon de Montfort , had defeated the royal army and taken King Henry III captive . For the next year , the reins of government were in Montfort 's hands , but his support soon began to crumble . On 4 August 1265 Montfort faced an army led by Prince Edward ( the later King Edward I ) and the powerful earl of Gloucester , who had recently defected to the royalist side , at the Battle of Evesham . The battle resulted in a complete royal victory ; Montfort was killed , and King Henry III was restored to full power . 
 Part of the rebellious forces held out , however , and their stronghold was the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle . In the summer of 1266 , a siege of the castle was initiated , but the effort proved futile . There were rumours that Montfort 's son Simon was planning an invasion of England from Normandy , and this was the hope that the rebels hung on to . It was in this situation that the papal legate Ottobuono Fieschi exerted his influence , to make the king pursue a more conciliatory policy . In August , the king summoned a parliament at Kenilworth , where the siege was ongoing . He commissioned a number of earls , barons and bishops to draft a treaty of reconciliation . 
 = = The Dictum of Kenilworth = = 
 The commission was created by parliament appointing three bishops and three barons , who then selected one more bishop , two earls , and three more barons . The final committee consisted of the bishops of Exeter , Bath and Wells , Worcester and St. David 's , the earls of Gloucester and Hereford , and six barons . This committee was given until All Saints Day ( 1 November ) to come up with provisions for a settlement . The result , known as the Dictum of Kenilworth , was made public on 31 October 1266 . 
 The primary point of the Dictum was the re @-@ establishment of royal authority . The Provisions of Oxford , that had been forced on the king , were repudiated , and it was made clear that the appointment of ministers was entirely a royal prerogative . King Henry in turn reconfirmed Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest . Measures were taken to renounce the increasing veneration of the fallen Simon de Montfort , whom some were already starting to consider a martyr and a possible saint . 
 The rebels had previously been completely disinherited , and their land taken into the king 's hands . The Dictum instead extended a pardon , and restored land to their previous owners , contingent on payment of certain penalties that were proportional to the level of involvement in the rebellion . It was traditional to value land at ten times its annual yield , and most of the rebels were subsequently fined at half of this amount : five times the annual yield of their lands . 
 Robert Ferrers , Earl of Derby , was singled out in particular for his central involvement in the rebellion , and for him the multiple was seven rather than five . The same was the case for Henry de Hastings , who was the commander of Kenilworth Castle . Those who had not taken part in the fighting themselves , but had incited others to rise up against the king , were fined at two year 's value , while those who had been compelled to fight , or played only a minor part , had to pay one year 's value of their land . The proceedings from the fines were awarded to royal supporters , some of whom had already been awarded parts of the rebels ' land , and now had to give it back . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Hostilities did not end with the publication of the Dictum . The garrison at Kenilworth refused to accept the terms given , and held out until 14 December , when deprivation forced them to surrender . In April 1267 , the earl of Gloucester – who had been central both to the royal victory at Evesham and to the drafting of the Dictum – turned against the king . He occupied the city of London , and set himself up as the champion of the disinherited . After negotiations involving both Edward and Ottobuono , Gloucester relented , and by June a settlement was reached . Gloucester had forced a change to the conditions of the Dictum , whereby the disinherited were allowed to recover their lands before they had paid their fines rather than after ; an arrangement that made repayment much easier . In the summer of that year , Prince Edward moved at the Isle of Ely , where the last of the rebels still held out , and forced them into submission under terms favourable to the rebels . 
 In November 1267 , parliament met at Marlborough . Here an important provision was issued that would become known to history as the Statute of Marlborough . This statute incorporated the clauses of the Dictum of Kenilworth that dealt with the restoration of royal power , and reconciliation between the loyalists and the rebels . The Statute of Marlborough became a basis for royal government , and the relationship between the king and his subjects , and as such the Dictum lived on in English constitutional history . 
 The spirit of peace and reconciliation established by the Dictum of Kenilworth lasted for the remainder of Henry III 's reign and into the 1290s . In 1270 , Prince Edward left the country to go on crusade in the Holy Land . When his father died in 1272 , Edward felt in a safe enough position to wait until 1274 before returning home to claim the throne . 
 = Die casting = 
 Die casting is a metal casting process that is characterized by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity . The mold cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process . Most die castings are made from non @-@ ferrous metals , specifically zinc , copper , aluminium , magnesium , lead , pewter and tin @-@ based alloys . Depending on the type of metal being cast , a <unk> or cold @-@ chamber machine is used . 
 The casting equipment and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit the process to high @-@ volume production . Manufacture of parts using die casting is relatively simple , involving only four main steps , which keeps the incremental cost per item low . It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium @-@ sized castings , which is why die casting produces more castings than any other casting process . Die castings are characterized by a very good surface finish ( by casting standards ) and dimensional consistency . 
 Two variants are pore @-@ free die casting , which is used to eliminate gas porosity defects ; and direct injection die casting , which is used with zinc castings to reduce scrap and increase yield . 
 = = History = = 
 Die casting equipment was invented in 1838 for the purpose of producing movable type for the printing industry . The first die casting @-@ related patent was granted in 1849 for a small hand @-@ operated machine for the purpose of mechanized printing type production . In 1885 Otto <unk> invented the linotype machine , an automated type @-@ casting device which became the prominent type of equipment in the publishing industry . The <unk> die @-@ casting machine , manufactured in Brooklyn , NY , was the first machine to be sold in the open market in North America . Other applications grew rapidly , with die casting facilitating the growth of consumer goods and appliances by making affordable the production of intricate parts in high volumes . In 1966 , General Motors released the Acurad process . 
 = = Cast metals = = 
 The main die casting alloys are : zinc , aluminium , magnesium , copper , lead , and tin ; although uncommon , ferrous die casting is also possible . Specific die casting alloys include : Zamak ; zinc aluminium ; aluminium to , e.g. The Aluminum Association ( AA ) standards : AA 380 , AA 384 , AA 386 , AA 390 ; and <unk> magnesium . The following is a summary of the advantages of each alloy : 
 Zinc : the easiest metal to cast ; high ductility ; high impact strength ; easily plated ; economical for small parts ; promotes long die life . 
 Aluminium : lightweight ; high dimensional stability for complex shapes and thin walls ; good corrosion resistance ; good mechanical properties ; high thermal and electrical conductivity ; retains strength at high temperatures . 
 Magnesium : the easiest metal to machine ; excellent strength @-@ to @-@ weight ratio ; lightest alloy commonly die cast . 
 Copper : high hardness ; high corrosion resistance ; highest mechanical properties of alloys die cast ; excellent wear resistance ; excellent dimensional stability ; strength approaching that of steel parts . 
 Silicon <unk> : high @-@ strength alloy made of copper , zinc and silicon . Often used as an alternative for investment casted steel parts . 
 Lead and tin : high density ; extremely close dimensional accuracy ; used for special forms of corrosion resistance . Such alloys are not used in foodservice applications for public health reasons . Type metal , an alloy of lead , tin and antimony ( with sometimes traces of copper ) is used for casting hand @-@ set type in letterpress printing and hot foil blocking . Traditionally cast in hand jerk moulds now predominantly die cast after the industrialisation of the type foundries . Around 1900 the slug casting machines came onto the market and added further automation , with sometimes dozens of casting machines at one newspaper office . 
 Maximum weight limits for aluminium , brass , magnesium and zinc castings are approximately 70 pounds ( 32 kg ) , 10 lb ( 4 @.@ 5 kg ) , 44 lb ( 20 kg ) , and 75 lb ( 34 kg ) , respectively . 
 The material used defines the minimum section thickness and minimum draft required for a casting as outlined in the table below . The thickest section should be less than 13 mm ( 0 @.@ 5 in ) , but can be greater . 
 = = Equipment = = 
 There are two basic types of die casting machines : hot @-@ chamber machines and cold @-@ chamber machines . These are rated by how much clamping force they can apply . Typical ratings are between 400 and 4 @,@ 000 st ( 2 @,@ 500 and 25 @,@ 400 kg ) . 
 = = = Hot @-@ chamber die casting = = = 
 Hot @-@ chamber die casting , also known as gooseneck machines , rely upon a pool of molten metal to feed the die . At the beginning of the cycle the piston of the machine is retracted , which allows the molten metal to fill the " gooseneck " . The <unk> or hydraulic @-@ powered piston then forces this metal out of the gooseneck into the die . The advantages of this system include fast cycle times ( approximately 15 cycles a minute ) and the convenience of melting the metal in the casting machine . The disadvantages of this system are that it is limited to use with low @-@ melting point metals and that aluminium cannot be used because it picks up some of the iron while in the molten pool . Therefore hot @-@ chamber machines are primarily used with <unk> , <unk> , and lead @-@ based alloys . 
 = = = Cold @-@ chamber die casting = = = 
 These are used when the casting alloy cannot be used in hot @-@ chamber machines ; these include aluminium , zinc alloys with a large composition of aluminium , magnesium and copper . The process for these machines start with melting the metal in a separate furnace . Then a precise amount of molten metal is transported to the cold @-@ chamber machine where it is fed into an unheated shot chamber ( or injection cylinder ) . This shot is then driven into the die by a hydraulic or mechanical piston . The biggest disadvantage of this system is the slower cycle time due to the need to transfer the molten metal from the furnace to the cold @-@ chamber machine . 
 = = Mold or <unk> = = 
 Two dies are used in die casting ; one is called the " cover die half " and the other the " ejector die half " . Where they meet is called the parting line . The cover die contains the sprue ( for hot @-@ chamber machines ) or shot hole ( for cold @-@ chamber machines ) , which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies ; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot @-@ chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold @-@ chamber machines . The ejector die contains the ejector pins and usually the runner , which is the path from the sprue or shot hole to the mold cavity . The cover die is secured to the stationary , or front , platen of the casting machine , while the ejector die is attached to the movable platen . The mold cavity is cut into two cavity inserts , which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves . 
 The dies are designed so that the finished casting will slide off the cover half of the die and stay in the ejector half as the dies are opened . This assures that the casting will be ejected every cycle because the ejector half contains the ejector pins to push the casting out of that die half . The ejector pins are driven by an ejector pin plate , which accurately drives all of the pins at the same time and with the same force , so that the casting is not damaged . The ejector pin plate also retracts the pins after ejecting the casting to prepare for the next shot . There must be enough ejector pins to keep the overall force on each pin low , because the casting is still hot and can be damaged by excessive force . The pins still leave a mark , so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the casting 's purpose . 
 Other die components include cores and slides . Cores are components that usually produce holes or opening , but they can be used to create other details as well . There are three types of cores : fixed , movable , and loose . Fixed cores are ones that are oriented parallel to the pull direction of the dies ( i.e. the direction the dies open ) , therefore they are fixed , or permanently attached to the die . Movable cores are ones that are oriented in any other way than parallel to the pull direction . These cores must be removed from the die cavity after the shot solidifies , but before the dies open , using a separate mechanism . Slides are similar to movable cores , except they are used to form undercut surfaces . The use of movable cores and slides greatly increases the cost of the dies . Loose cores , also called pick @-@ outs , are used to cast intricate features , such as threaded holes . These loose cores are inserted into the die by hand before each cycle and then ejected with the part at the end of the cycle . The core then must be removed by hand . Loose cores are the most expensive type of core , because of the extra labor and increased cycle time . Other features in the dies include water @-@ cooling passages and vents along the parting lines . These vents are usually wide and thin ( approximately 0 @.@ 13 mm or 0 @.@ 005 in ) so that when the molten metal starts filling them the metal quickly solidifies and minimizes scrap . No risers are used because the high pressure ensures a continuous feed of metal from the gate . 
 The most important material properties for the dies are thermal shock resistance and softening at elevated temperature ; other important properties include <unk> , machinability , heat checking resistance , weldability , availability ( especially for larger dies ) , and cost . The longevity of a die is directly dependent on the temperature of the molten metal and the cycle time . The dies used in die casting are usually made out of hardened tool steels , because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved , therefore the dies are very expensive , resulting in high start @-@ up costs . Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy steels . 
 The main failure mode for die casting dies is wear or erosion . Other failure modes are heat checking and thermal fatigue . Heat checking is when surface cracks occur on the die due to a large temperature change on every cycle . Thermal fatigue is when surface cracks occur on the die due to a large number of cycles . 
 = = Process = = 
 The following are the four steps in traditional die casting , also known as high @-@ pressure die casting , these are also the basis for any of the die casting variations : die preparation , filling , ejection , and shakeout . The dies are prepared by spraying the mold cavity with lubricant . The lubricant both helps control the temperature of the die and it also assists in the removal of the casting . The dies are then closed and molten metal is injected into the dies under high pressure ; between 10 and 175 megapascals ( 1 @,@ 500 and 25 @,@ 400 psi ) . Once the mold cavity is filled , the pressure is maintained until the casting solidifies . The dies are then opened and the shot ( shots are different from castings because there can be multiple cavities in a die , yielding multiple castings per shot ) is ejected by the ejector pins . Finally , the shakeout involves separating the scrap , which includes the gate , runners , sprues and flash , from the shot . This is often done using a special trim die in a power press or hydraulic press . Other methods of shaking out include sawing and grinding . A less labor @-@ intensive method is to tumble shots if gates are thin and easily broken ; separation of gates from finished parts must follow . This scrap is recycled by remelting it . The yield is approximately 67 % . 
 The high @-@ pressure injection leads to a quick fill of the die , which is required so the entire cavity fills before any part of the casting solidifies . In this way , discontinuities are avoided , even if the shape requires difficult @-@ to @-@ fill thin sections . This creates the problem of air entrapment , because when the mold is filled quickly there is little time for the air to escape . This problem is minimized by including vents along the parting lines , however , even in a highly refined process there will still be some porosity in the center of the casting . 
 Most die casters perform other secondary operations to produce features not readily castable , such as tapping a hole , polishing , plating , buffing , or painting . 
 = = = Inspection = = = 
 After the shakeout of the casting it is inspected for defects . The most common defects are <unk> and cold shuts . These defects can be caused by cold dies , low metal temperature , dirty metal , lack of venting , or too much lubricant . Other possible defects are gas porosity , shrinkage porosity , hot tears , and flow marks . Flow marks are marks left on the surface of the casting due to poor gating , sharp corners , or excessive lubricant . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Water @-@ based lubricants , called emulsions , are the most commonly used type of lubricant , because of health , environmental , and safety reasons . Unlike solvent @-@ based lubricants , if water is properly treated to remove all minerals from it , it will not leave any by @-@ product in the dies . If the water is not properly treated , then the minerals can cause surface defects and discontinuities . There are four types of water @-@ based lubricants : oil in water , water in oil , semi @-@ synthetic , and synthetic . Oil in water is the best , because when the lubricant is applied , the water cools the die surface by evaporating while depositing the oil , which helps release the shot . A common mixture for this type of lubricants is thirty parts water to one part oil , however in extreme cases a ratio of 100 : 1 is used . 
 Oils that are used include heavy residual oil ( HRO ) , animal fats , vegetable fats , and synthetic fats . <unk> are gelatinous at room temperature , but at the high temperatures found in die casting , they form a thin film . Other substances are added to control the emulsions viscosity and thermal properties ; these include graphite , aluminium , and mica . Other chemical additives are used to inhibit rusting and oxidation . <unk> are added to water @-@ based lubricants , so that oil based additives can be mixed into the water ; these include soap , alcohol esters , and ethylene oxides . 
 Historically , solvent @-@ based lubricants , such as diesel fuel and kerosene , were commonly used . These were good at releasing the part from the dies , but a small explosion occurred during each shot , which led to a build @-@ up of carbon on the mold cavity walls . However , they were easier to apply evenly than water @-@ based lubricants . 
 = = = Advantages and disadvantages = = = 
 Advantages of die casting : 
 Excellent dimensional accuracy ( dependent on casting material , but typically 0 @.@ 1 mm for the first 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 005 inch for the first inch ) and 0 @.@ 02 mm for each additional centimeter ( 0 @.@ 002 inch for each additional inch ) . 
 Smooth cast surfaces ( Ra 1 – 2 @.@ 5 micrometres or 0 @.@ 04 – 0 @.@ 10 thou <unk> ) . 
 Thinner walls can be cast as compared to sand and permanent mold casting ( approximately 0 @.@ 75 mm or 0 @.@ 030 in ) . 
 <unk> can be cast @-@ in ( such as threaded inserts , heating elements , and high strength bearing surfaces ) . 
 <unk> or eliminates secondary machining operations . 
 Rapid production rates . 
 Casting tensile strength as high as 415 megapascals ( 60 ksi ) . 
 Casting of low fluidity metals . 
 The main disadvantage to die casting is the very high capital cost . Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly , as compared to most other casting processes . Therefore , to make die casting an economic process , a large production volume is needed . Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high @-@ fluidity metals , and casting weights must be between 30 grams ( 1 oz ) and 10 kg ( 20 lb ) . In the standard die casting process the final casting will have a small amount of porosity . This prevents any heat treating or welding , because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand , which causes micro @-@ cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface . Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable . Parts needing hardening ( through hardening or case hardening ) and tempering are not cast in dies .

 = = = Acurad = = = 
 Acurad was a die casting process developed by General Motors in the late 1950s and 1960s . The name is an acronym for accurate , reliable , and dense . It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional solidification with the fast cycle times of the traditional die casting process . The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting : thermal analysis , flow and fill modeling , heat treatable and high integrity die castings , and indirect squeeze casting ( explained below ) . 
 The thermal analysis was the first done for any casting process . This was done by creating an electrical analog of the thermal system . A cross @-@ section of the dies were drawn on <unk> paper and then thermal loads and cooling patterns were drawn onto the paper . Water lines were represented by magnets of various sizes . The thermal conductivity was represented by the reciprocal of the resistivity of the paper . 
 The Acurad system employed a bottom fill system that required a stable flow @-@ front . Logical thought processes and trial and error were used because computerized analysis did not exist yet ; however this modeling was the precursor to computerized flow and fill modeling . 
 The Acurad system was the first die casting process that could successfully cast low @-@ iron aluminum alloys , such as A356 and <unk> . In a traditional die casting process these alloys would solder to the die . Similarly , Acurad castings could be heat treated and meet the U.S. military specification MIL @-@ A @-@ <unk> . 
 Finally , the Acurad system employed a patented double shot piston design . The idea was to use a second piston ( located within the primary piston ) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified around the perimeter of the casting cavity and shot sleeve . While the system was not very effective , it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines , Ube Industries , to discover that it was just as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston ; this is indirect squeeze casting . 
 = = = Pore @-@ free = = = 
 When no porosity is allowed in a cast part then the pore @-@ free casting process is used . It is identical to the standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot to purge any air from the mold cavity . This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die , which virtually eliminates gas porosity . An added advantage to this is greater strength .

 = San Giacomo Scossacavalli = 
 San Giacomo Scossacavalli ( also known as San Giacomo a Scossacavalli ) was a church in Rome important for historical and artistic reasons . The church , facing the Piazza Scossacavalli , was built during the early Middle Ages and since the early 16th century hosted a confraternity which commissioned Renaissance architect Antonio da Sangallo the Younger to build a new shrine . This was richly decorated with frescoes , painted ( among others ) by mannerist artist Giovanni Battista Ricci and his students . The church was demolished in 1937 , when Via della Conciliazione ( the avenue leading to St. Peter 's Basilica ) was built and the piazza and central part of the Borgo rione were demolished . Many decorative elements still exist , since they were preserved from demolition . 
 = = Location = = 
 The church was located in Rome 's Borgo rione , on the east side of Piazza Scossacavalli , its facade facing west and opposite the Palazzo dei Convertendi . Its south side paralleled the Borgo Vecchio .

 The church 's name gave birth to a legend . When Helena ( mother of Constantine the Great ) returned from her trip to the Holy Land , she brought back two stone relics : one from the presentation of Jesus at the Temple and one on which Abraham bound Isaac . The empress wanted to donate the stones to Saint Peter 's Basilica , but when the convoy arrived at the site of the future church the horses ( Italian : <unk> ) refused to move further despite urging ( Italian : <unk> ) . A chapel hosting the stones was built , the origin of the church . The most probable reason for the name was the discovery , near the square , of a thigh from a Roman equestrian statue ( coxa <unk> in Vulgar Latin ) . 
 The church had an ancient origin : during the Middle Ages it was dedicated to the Redeemer ( Italian : Salvatore ) , and was called San <unk> de <unk> <unk> in the papal bulls of Sergius I ( r . 687 – 701 ) and Leo IV ( r . 847 @-@ 55 ) . It is also mentioned in the main medieval catalogues of Roman churches , like that of <unk> Camerarius and of Paris . 
 According to some sources , the church could be identified with San Salvatore de <unk> ; a <unk> was the staff borne by pilgrims coming to St. Peter 's . These would have left their staffs in San Giacomo before entering Saint Peter , exactly as they did after completing the Way of St. James , and this fact would explain also the late dedication to Saint James . 
 In 1250 , relics of St. James were brought to the church and its dedication was changed . It was usually known in contemporary documents as S. Jacobus de Portico , where the <unk> in medieval Rome was the covered passage linking Saint Peter 's with the Tiber ( <unk> Sancti Petri ) . In 1198 Pope Innocent III ( r . 1198 – 1216 ) entrusted the Chapter of Saint Peter ( Italian : <unk> di San Pietro ) with the church 's care , and in 1275 the church became a parish . 
 = = = Renaissance = = = 
 In 1520 the confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament ( Italian : <unk> del <unk> Sacramento ) was entrusted with the church 's care . The confraternity originated in Borgo in 1509 . On a windy evening of 1506 , a Carmelite coming from the old Santa Maria in Traspontina church ( lying near Castel Sant 'Angelo ) , followed by a lay brother bearing a candle , was bringing the sacramental bread to a sick person . Since the wind had extinguished the candle , the layman went into a nearby shop asking for fire , so that the priest was left alone . At the sight of the lone priest bearing the blessed Sacrament , several passers @-@ by were moved , gathered around him and accompanied him , bearing a baldachin and torches . The group grew , and on 3 September 1509 its members formed a <unk> . The Carmelites assigned it to a chapel in Santa Maria in Traspontina , and in 1513 Pope Leo X ( r . 1513 – 21 ) acknowledged the association , which in 1520 moved to San Giacomo . 
 The members wore clothing made from white hessian fabric ( Italian : <unk> ) . It had a small figure on the left shoulder : a vermilion chalice and an image of Christ with open arms . The confraternity was committed to provide a doctor and barber to the poor of the parish , and each Holy Thursday in the church it exhibited a wax sculpture of the crucified Christ . An annual procession went to Santa Maria Sopra Minerva in Pigna , the Pauline Chapel in the Apostolic Palace and finally to St. Peter 's . In 1578 Pope Gregory XIII ( r . 1572 – 85 ) made the association an archconfraternity . The association 's duties and privileges increased ; each year beginning in 1580 , the brothers gave four poor parish girls a white dress and twenty @-@ five scudi as a dowry . In 1590 , Pope Sixtus V ( <unk> – 90 ) gave the archconfraternity the privilege of setting free each year a person condemned to death .. 
 Shortly after their assignment to San Giacomo , the brethren started to reconstruct it , choosing as architect Antonio da Sangallo the Younger , but due to lack of funds its facade was still unfinished in 1590 . That year Ludovico <unk> , ecclesiastical <unk> and governor of the archconfraternity , died , leaving his inheritance to the association . Thanks to his legacy , two years later , the construction was finished . In 1601 , an oratory dedicated to Saint Sebastian was built behind the church . 
 = = = Baroque and Modern Ages = = = 
 San Giacomo underwent thorough restorations in the first half of the 17th century and the second half of the 18th . On 23 November 1777 , the church was reconsecrated by Cardinal Henry Benedict Stuart . 
 It was damaged during the French occupation of Rome under Napoleon and restored in 1810 and 1880 , when the stone <unk> were removed . In 1825 San Giacomo lost its status as a parish . In 1927 a fire damaged several works of art , and in 1929 it was assigned to the Sons of Divine Providence . 
 The church was demolished by 30 September 1937 for the construction of Via della Conciliazione . Its art was given to the <unk> di San Pietro and then to the Museo <unk> ; some chapel frescoes are on display at the Museo di Roma . Elements of the facade , including the 17th @-@ century <unk> portal decorated with cherubs , are in the comune storehouse at the <unk> <unk> . The two relics ( of Isaac 's sacrifice and the presentation of Jesus in the temple ) were placed in the church of the Santi Michele e Magno , the national church of the Dutch in Borgo , during the early 1990s ; the latter is now the church 's main altar . 
 = = Description = = 
 The church 's artistic importance is primarily due to its design by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and its frescoes and paintings , particularly those by the Piemontese mannerist painter Giovanni Battista Ricci and his students . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 When Antonio da Sangallo was commissioned to rebuild the church , his main problem was its shape ; its width , facing Piazza Scossacavalli , was longer than its depth ( along Borgo Vecchio ) . Drawings in the Uffizi indicate several solutions : a single @-@ nave plan , oriented along its long side with a side entrance , and octagonal and oval plans . The latter was adopted by Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola for the church of Sant 'Anna dei <unk> , and became popular during the 17th century . Sangallo did not adopt any of these plans , instead deciding to reduce the area of the church , whose plan became a rectangle with its long side normal to Piazza Scossacavalli . Its nave was flanked by four large niches , and Sangallo designed four rooms ( two on each side ) as sacristies . 
 The church 's appearance in the mid @-@ 16th century , shortly before its completion , is known from a woodcut by Girolamo <unk> . Its facade appears almost square ; at its center there was a portal with a tympanum , surmounted by a large fanlight opened by a round window . On its side were three rows of pilasters with two pairs of niches , one over the other . A bell @-@ gable was on one side of the roof . 
 When the facade was completed high plinths , consisting of a tympanum with a large panel adorned with frescoes and outlined by a <unk> frame , were added at the base of the pilasters . At the slopes ' edges were two candelabra , and two <unk> were at the base of the second order . These elements gave the facade ( which , since 1592 , also bore the coats of arms of Pope Clement VIII ( r . 1592 – 1605 ) and the confraternity ) an upward swing . The facade was adorned with frescoes of sacred subjects , including " faked figures of yellow Saints made of golden metal " attributed to Giovanni Guerra or Cristoforo <unk> . 
 The church , without an apse and a transept , maintained its original single @-@ nave plan until at least 1627 . In 1662 the naves had become three , separated by two rows of square brick pillars and surmounted by vaults . The church had five altars in 1627 , increasing to six in 1649 . In 1726 the closing of its side gate along the Borgo Vecchio made room for another altar . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 On the right side , the first chapel was dedicated to the Virgin Mary . On its vault were paintings of four Doctors of the Church ( Ambrose , Jerome , Augustine and Gregory the Great ) , and its walls were adorned with frescoes by Cristoforo <unk> ( or Ambrogi ) . Several frescoes , depicting events in the Life of the Virgin attributed to a late @-@ mannerist Emilian artist , are on display at the Museo di Roma . The second chapel was dedicated to San Biagio , and housed a panel painting of the saint . This , the last chapel added to the church , was the original side door on the Borgo Vecchio . The third chapel was dedicated to the Nativity of Jesus . It was called " of the circumcision " because of a painting by Giovanni Battista Ricci ( nicknamed " il Novara " after his birthplace ) of the Circumcision of Jesus . It was also known as the " chapel of the stone " , since the stone over which Jesus had reportedly been presented at the temple in Jerusalem was kept here ; after the church 's demolition , the stone and that of the sacrifice of Isaac were moved to the nearby church of Santi Michele e Magno . Above its altar was an oil painting by a student of Ricci of the presentation of Jesus . A 16th @-@ century fresco depicting the Pietà as part of a choir of angels was on a bottom wall of the nave . 
 On the left side , the first chapel was dedicated to the Nativity of Mary . Since 1573 this chapel , the <unk> of the Milanese Carcano family , contained the stone reportedly used for Isaac 's sacrifice . A Ricci painting of the birth of Mary was on its altar ; on its vault were the Four Evangelists , and its walls were decorated with frescoes . The second chapel , dedicated to San Giacomo , had a statue ( later replaced by a painting ) of the saint above the altar and was the burial place for members of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament . The third chapel , dedicated to the Crucifixion , contained a large sculpture of Christ on the cross . 
 A Ricci painting of the Last Supper was above the main altar , which was dedicated to Jesus the Redeemer ; in 1662 , a fresco of the Madonna was moved there . The <unk> cardinals had the image painted on the facade of their palace in Borgo Sant 'Angelo , and it was venerated by the local people because of a number of miracles attributed to her intercession . On the altar was an African @-@ marble tabernacle by Giovanni Battista <unk> , and to the right of the entrance was a holy water font presented to the church in 1589 by Francesco Del <unk> ( a member of the archconfraternity ) . The church was the burial place of several people , whose tombstones adorned the floor ; among them were the son and mother @-@ in @-@ law of Pirro <unk> and Battista <unk> , son of the Oratory of San Sebastiano architect Antonio <unk> .

 Tripathi had initially decided to write a book on the philosophy of evil , but was dissuaded by his family members , so he decided to write a book on Shiva , one of the Hindu Gods . He decided to base his story on a radical idea that all Gods were once human beings ; it was their deeds in the human life that made them famous as Gods . After finishing writing The Immortals of Meluha , Tripathi faced rejection from many publication houses . Ultimately when his agent decided to publish the book himself , Tripathi embarked on a promotional campaign . It included posting a live @-@ action video on YouTube , and making the first chapter of the book available as a free digital download , to entice readers . 
 Ultimately , when the book was published in February 2010 , it went on to become a huge commercial success . It had to be reprinted a number of times to keep up with the demand . Tripathi even changed his publisher and hosted a big launch for the book in Delhi . It was critically appreciated by some Indian reviewers , others noted that Tripathi 's writing tended to lose focus at some parts of the story . With the launch of the third installment , titled The Oath of the Vayuputras , on February 2013 , the Shiva Trilogy has become the fastest selling book series in the history of Indian publishing , with 2 @.@ 5 million copies in print and over ₹ 60 crore ( US $ 8 @.@ 9 million ) in sales .

 Author Amish Tripathi is a finance professional educated from Indian Institute of Management Calcutta ( IIM @-@ C ) . While working in the insurance industry , Tripathi felt that his life was devoid of any meaning or self . Ultimately he decided to take the spiritual route . He started reading on the different philosophies and the Indian mythologies . One day , while watching a historical program , Tripathi and his family got into the discussion about consciousness and the evil inside man . In the program they learned that in ancient Persia , demons were known as <unk> ( a term reserved for the Gods in Indian mythology ) , and angels were called Asuras ( a term reserved for demons in Indian mythology ) . Tripathi added , " It set me thinking that this was exact opposite of our Vedic etymology where evil was Asura and gods were Devas . It struck me that if the two civilizations were to confront each other , they would be at stark odds and calling each other evil . " But when he decided to write a book about the philosophy of evil , his family discouraged him , saying that the subject itself was not popular and would get a narrow audience . They suggested that Tripathi write a thriller / adventure novel and the philosophy should be a part of the story , hence there would be a mainstream appeal in it . Tripathi felt that no subject was better than Shiva , one of the major Hindu deity and the destroyer of evil ; his journey and stories about him would deliver the philosophy that he wanted to convey , to his readers . Once he started to write a book about Shiva , he decided to base it on some fundamental beliefs of his . He noted that the Hindu Gods were probably not " mythical beings or a figment of a rich imagination " , but rather they were once human beings like the rest . It was their deeds in the human life that made them famous as Gods . 
 The story was based on Meluha — the probable ancient name for the Indus Valley Civilisation , according to modern historians . Tripathi also included the Indian Royal lineage of the Sun and the Moon Dynasties , calling them Suryavanshis and Chandravanshi . Tripathi had been an avid reader of history from a long time , and his other inspirations for The Immortals of Meluha ranged from writers like Graham Hancock and Gregory <unk> to the Amar Chitra Katha series of Indian comics . For the mythological parts in the novel , Tripathi relied on the stories and fables that he had heard in his childhood from his family . Tripathi 's grandfather was a pundit and his parents are avid readers of Indian mythology , hence he found it easy to trust what he had heard from his parents and grandparents , and relied on them for the stories in the novel . Tripathi utilized Microsoft Excel to divide his writings into different parts , including characters , the plot , sub @-@ plots and deadlines for events . However , it did not work out correctly as he was losing track of events , and he gave up the strategy . Around this time , Tripathi 's wife suggested an alternative . She asked him not to control the fate of his characters beforehand , but let the plot develop on its own . Tripathi applied these suggestions and the result was a smoother outflow . " Things came in bits and pieces , not in a sequence but were put into perspective later . " 
 = = Release and marketing = = 
 After the book was written , Tripathi felt that it would be difficult for him to get a big publication house to publish his novel . The manuscript for The Immortals of Meluha got rejected by 35 to 40 publication houses . Hence , he decided to apply his management skills and promote his book . The Immortals of Meluha — originally titled Shiva : The Man , The Legend — was finally released by Tripathi ’ s literary agent Anuj Bahri , the owner of the landmark <unk> Booksellers in Khan Market , New Delhi . Tripathi explained with Daily News and Analysis , " I would be lying if I said that I was sure I would get a big publisher for my first novel . I was a finance guy and a staunch believer in digital marketing that has a better reach in the books market . It actually puts up a conversation rather than a two @-@ minute wire on the same . " Together with his friends , Tripathi launched his promotion of the book on the internet . He put up the entire first chapter of The Immortals of Meluha as a digital download from his website , so that the readers would get interested . With the help of his musician friend Taufiq Qureshi , he launched a live @-@ action trailer film on YouTube and built an online community in Facebook and Twitter , surrounding the video , to further hold the reader 's interest . 
 Another friend of Tripathi , Rashmi Pusalkar , designed the book cover according to his specifications , which were to keep a balance between reality and fantasy . Hence Pusalkar chose to just portray the back profile of Shiva , standing in front of a huge lake . Since Pusalkar had never designed any book covers before , she felt that the task was more daunting for her , and explained " Shiva is a human of flesh and blood , he is not a God . The challenge was to show him as vulnerable . I portrayed him from the back , because Indian Gods are never seen from the back . He has battle scars and a sculpted physique . " Tripathi wanted the cover to have a symbolic meaning . The scenery behind Shiva 's image is taken from Mount Kailash and Mansarovar Lake . He also created a clay model of the broken Pashupati seal , which was later photographed and used in the book inlay . The increasing brightness of the book covers , from the dull colors of The Immortals of Meluha to the bright hue of The Oath of the Vayuputras , signified the triumph of good over evil , according to Tripathi . 
 Other promotional campaigns included introducing bound versions of the first chapter of the novel , across city bookstores . Tripathi felt that a celebrity name associated with the book would do wonders for its promotion . Hence he sent the book to various known faces in the publishing world like Anil Dharker and Prahlad Kakkar . Ultimately , when Tripathi 's agent Tiwari decided to publish around 5 @,@ 000 copies of the book himself , they already had the celebrity preview attached to it , and it helped in promotion . The UK publication rights of the Shiva trilogy , including The Immortals of Meluha was purchased by Jo Fletcher Books , with the deal being made by Claire Roberts at Trident Media Group , acting on behalf of the author and Bahri from Red Ink Literary Agency . The book would be released in the United States in summer 2013 . In 2013 , a music album called Vayuputras , an original soundtrack based on the Shiva Trilogy books , was released . The album is an extension of The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas with special tracks inspired by important junctures like Shiva 's dance and the war speech in the books . Artists like Sonu Nigam , Taufiq Qureshi , Palash Sen , Bickram Ghosh worked on the album . This was the first time ever that an original soundtrack was made for a book series . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 After its publication , The Immortals of Meluha received mostly positive response from critics for its concept but the prose received mixed reviews . Pradip Bhattacharya from The Statesman felt that the " plot skips along at a brisk pace , the characters are well etched and the reader ’ s attention is not allowed to flag . It will be interesting to see how the trilogy progresses . One cannot but admire the creative drive that impels a finance professional to embark on such an ambitious odyssey on uncharted seas . " Another review by Gaurav Vasudev from the same newspaper wrote that " the book is a gripping mythological story written in modern style . " 
 Devdutt Pattanaik from The Tribune commented that " the writer takes us on a sinister journey with the characters , who frequently sound as if they are one of us only . " Society magazine complimented Tripathi 's writing by saying , " Reading this beautifully written creation is like plunging into the icy and venerable waters of the <unk> Lake . One can actually sense the beats of Shiva 's <unk> and fumes of intoxicating <unk> . Simply <unk> . " Nandita Sengupta from The Times of India felt that " while the author spins a tale of adventure , it could have been a slightly snappier , tighter read . Some crunching of thoughts that tended to overlap and repeat would be welcome in the next two books . " However , Sengupta was most impressed by the author 's crafting of Shiva as a " rough @-@ hewn , hot @-@ headed , a great dancer , smitten by Sati ... Shiva 's our definition of a hero , ready to fight for a good cause anytime . " 
 Lisa <unk> from The New Indian Express was impressed with the story and Tripathi 's writing and praised " the interactions between Shiva and Sati , [ which were ] intriguing . Age @-@ old thoughts and philosophies were delivered in a very modern context , which I thought made for an interesting juxtaposition . " <unk> added that " the only downside throughout the novel , I was unable to really get into the main characters — they remained mostly on a two @-@ dimensional level . " It received a mixed review from Hindustan Times , where the reviewer was critical of Tripathi 's usage of common , everyday language . " There are many other subtle depictions of Lord Ram and other characters and overall its very well written . I wrote to Amish to express one small observation , the script writing is not that sharp . You have words like ' <unk> ' , ' bloody hell ' , ' In the name of God what is this nonsense ? ' etc , which I guess would be great for an Indian audience but after you just finish a Steven Erikson novel you find it falling a little flat , " the reviewer concluded .

 The Immortals of Meluha was a commercial success . Just after a week of its publication in February 2010 , the book hit the best seller list of several magazines and newspapers , including The Statesman , The Economic Times , The Times of India , Rolling Stone India , among others . The book had to be re @-@ printed for another 5 @,@ 000 copies thrice within the next week , and by the end of July , it had sold around 45 @,@ 000 copies across India . Both Tripathi and Tiwari decided that a transfer of the rights of the book to a larger publisher was needed , so as to take the book to higher grounds . Many publishers bid for it , but they went with Westland Publishers , who had been the distributing partner for the book . The Westland edition of the book was published on 10 September 2010 , in Delhi amidst a media frenzy . It was launched by former UN diplomat Shashi Tharoor , who praised it . The edited version of The Immortals of Meluha was accompanied by the release of an audiobook for the novel . As of January 2013 , The Immortals of Meluha , and its sequel , The Secret of the Nagas , have crossed a print run of a million copies . These books have continued to top the bestseller lists of Nielsen BookScan , with the gross retail sales being impressive at ₹ 22 crore ( US $ 3 @.@ 3 million ) within two years of publishing . As of June 2015 over 2 @.@ 5 million copies of the Shiva Trilogy have been sold and have also made over ₹ 60 crore ( US $ 8 @.@ 9 million ) in revenue . 
 = = Translations = = 
 The books have been translated into a number of languages like English ( South Asia ) , Hindi , Marathi , Bengali , Gujarati , Assamese , Malayalam , Telugu , Kannada , Bahasa Indonesian , Tamil , English ( UK ) , Estonian and Spanish , with the author believing that publishing as a whole is gradually being embedded in the Indian business sensibilities . Further explaining his thoughts , Tripathi said " I genuinely believe those five years from today , we will have a situation when other languages will account for higher sales of books than in English . That is the big change happening in publishing — it is taking pride in its own culture than knowing other cultures like in television , where regional language channels have more TRPs . " The local language versions were also commercial success . The Telugu version was translated by Rama Sundari and published by BCS Publishers and Distributors ; the book sold more than 5 @,@ 000 copies in a month and went for a second print order of 10 @,@ 000 copies . Other than the local versions , the books have also been released in the Amazon Kindle version , available only in India .

 Film director Karan Johar 's Dharma Productions has landed the film rights of The Immortals of Meluha . Johar said that he was " blown away with the world of Meluha and rivetted by Amish 's creation of it . I think the book lends itself beautifully for celluloid and we are very excited to promote Amish 's labour of love effectively . " The director was confirmed to be looking into the finer details of the production , along with the screenplay . Though initially speculated that Karan Malhotra 's Shuddhi would be the theatrical adaptation of the book , it was later proven false . In September 2013 , Johar announced that Malhotra would be directing The Immortals of Meluha , but only after the theatrical release of Shuddhi . Tripathi also revealed during Jaipur Literature Festival that an unnamed Hollywood producer bought the rights for an American version of the films . This led to speculation in the media whether Johar would indeed helm the film or the release would be an American production . In January 2015 , while revealing the title of his next book , Scion of Ikshvaku , Tripathi revealed that the film adaptation was on @-@ going and was probably the biggest budget that any film series have had . He also confirmed that director and screenwriter Karan Malhotra was adapting the story into the film script , with Tripathi acting as creative consultant and reviewer . 
 = Art Spiegelman = 
 Art Spiegelman ( born Itzhak Avraham ben Zeev on February 15 , 1948 ) is an American cartoonist , editor , and comics advocate best known for his graphic novel Maus . His work as co @-@ editor on the comics magazines Arcade and Raw has been influential , and from 1992 he spent a decade as contributing artist for The New Yorker , where he made several high @-@ profile and sometimes controversial covers . He is married to designer and editor Françoise Mouly and is the father of writer Nadja Spiegelman . 
 Spiegelman began his career with the Topps bubblegum card company in the mid @-@ 1960s , which was his main financial support for two decades ; there he co @-@ created parodic series such as Wacky Packages in the 1960s and the Garbage Pail Kids in the 1980s . He gained prominence in the underground comix scene in the 1970s with short , experimental , and often autobiographical work . A selection of these strips appeared in the collection Breakdowns in 1977 , after which Spiegelman turned focus to the book @-@ length Maus , about his relation with his father , a Holocaust survivor . The postmodern book depicts Nazis as cats , Jews as mice , and ethnic Poles as pigs , and took thirteen years until its completion in 1991 . It won a special Pulitzer Prize in 1992 and has gained a reputation as a pivotal work , responsible for bringing scholarly attention to the comics medium . 
 Spiegelman and Mouly edited eleven issues of Raw from 1980 to 1991 . The oversized comics and graphics magazine helped introduce talents who became prominent in alternative comics , such as Charles Burns , Chris Ware , and Ben <unk> , and introduced several foreign cartoonists to the English @-@ speaking comics world . Beginning in the 1990s , the couple worked for The New Yorker , which Spiegelman left to work on In the Shadow of No Towers ( 2004 ) , about his reaction to the September 11 attacks in New York in 2001 . 
 Spiegelman advocates for greater comics literacy . As an editor , a teacher at the School of Visual Arts in New York City , and a lecturer , Spiegelman has promoted better understanding of comics and has mentored younger cartoonists . 
 = = Family history = = 
 Art Spiegelman 's parents were Polish Jews Władysław ( 1906 – 1982 ) and <unk> ( 1912 – 1968 ) Spiegelman . His father was born Zeev Spiegelman , with the Hebrew name Zeev ben Avraham . Władysław was his Polish name , and <unk> ( or Vladek in Russified form ) was a diminutive of this name . He was also known as Wilhelm under the German occupation , and upon immigration to the United States he took the name William . His mother was born <unk> <unk> , with the Hebrew name Hannah . She took the name Anna upon her immigration to the US . In Spiegelman 's Maus , from which the couple are best known , Spiegelman used the spellings " Vladek " and " Anja " , which he believed would be easier for Americans to pronounce . The surname Spiegelman is German for " mirror man " . 
 The <unk> had one other son , Rysio ( spelled " Richieu " in Maus ) , who died before Art was born at the age of five or six . During the Holocaust , Spiegelman 's parents sent Rysio to stay with an aunt , with whom they believed he would be safe . The aunt poisoned herself along with Rysio and two other young family members in her care so that the Nazis would not take them to the extermination camps . After the war , the <unk> , unable to accept that Rysio was dead , searched orphanages all over Europe in the hope of finding him . Spiegelman talked of having a sort of sibling rivalry with his " ghost brother " — he felt unable to compete with an " ideal " brother who " never threw tantrums or got in any kind of trouble " . Of 85 Spiegelman relatives alive at the beginning of World War II , only 13 are known to have survived the Holocaust .

 = = = Early life = = = 
 Spiegelman was born Itzhak Avraham ben Zeev in Stockholm , Sweden , on February 15 , 1948 . He immigrated with his parents to the US in 1951 . Upon immigration his name was registered as Arthur Isadore , but he later had his given name changed to Art . Initially the family settled in Norristown , Pennsylvania , and then relocated to Rego Park in Queens , New York City , in 1957 . He began cartooning in 1960 and imitated the style of his favorite comic books , such as Mad . At Russell Sage Junior High School , where he was an honors student , he produced the Mad @-@ inspired fanzine <unk> . He was earning money from his drawing by the time he reached high school and sold artwork to the original Long Island Press and other outlets . His talent was such that he caught the eyes of United Features Syndicate , who offered him the chance to produce a syndicated comic strip . Dedicated to the idea of art as expression , he turned down this commercial opportunity . He attended the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan beginning in 1963 . He met Woody Gelman , the art director of Topps Chewing Gum Company , who encouraged Spiegelman to apply to Topps after graduating high school . At 15 Spiegelman received payment for his work from a Rego Park newspaper . 
 After he graduated in 1965 , Spiegelman 's parents urged him to pursue the financial security of a career such as dentistry , but he chose instead to enrol at Harpur College to study art and philosophy . While there , he got a freelance art job at Topps , which provided him with an income for the next two decades . 
 Spiegelman attended Harpur College from 1965 until 1968 , where he worked as staff cartoonist for the college newspaper and edited a college humor magazine . After a summer internship when he was 18 , Topps hired him for Gelman 's Product Development Department as a creative consultant making trading cards and related products in 1966 , such as the Wacky Packages series of parodic trading cards begun in 1967 . 
 Spiegelman began selling self @-@ published underground comix on street corners in 1966 . He had cartoons published in underground publications such as the East Village Other and traveled to San Francisco for a few months in 1967 , where the underground comix scene was just beginning to <unk> . 
 In late winter 1968 Spiegelman suffered a brief but intense nervous breakdown , which cut his university studies short . He has said that at the time he was taking LSD with great frequency . He spent a month in Binghamton State Mental Hospital , and shortly after he got out his mother committed suicide following the death of her only surviving brother . 
 = = = Underground comix ( 1971 – 1977 ) = = = 
 In 1971 , after several visits , Spiegelman moved to San Francisco and became a part of the countercultural underground comix movement that had been developing there . Some of the comix he produced during this period include The Compleat Mr. Infinity ( 1970 ) , a ten @-@ page booklet of explicit comic strips , and The Viper Vicar of Vice , Villainy and <unk> ( 1972 ) , a transgressive work in the vein of fellow underground cartoonist S. Clay Wilson . Spiegelman 's work also appeared in underground magazines such as Gothic Blimp Works , Bijou Funnies , Young Lust , Real Pulp , and Bizarre Sex , and were in a variety of styles and genres as Spiegelman sought his artistic voice . He also did a number of cartoons for men 's magazines such as Cavalier , The Dude , and Gent . 
 In 1972 , Justin Green asked Spiegelman to do a three @-@ page strip for the first issue of Funny Aminals [ sic ] . He wanted to do one about racism , and at first considered a story with African @-@ Americans as mice and cats taking on the role of the Ku Klux Klan . Instead , he turned to the Holocaust that his parents had survived . He titled the strip " Maus " and depicted the Jews as mice persecuted by die <unk> , which were Nazis as cats . The narrator related the story to a mouse named " Mickey " . With this story Spiegelman felt he had found his voice . 
 Seeing Green 's revealingly autobiographical Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary while in @-@ progress in 1971 inspired Spiegelman to produce " Prisoner on the Hell Planet " , an expressionistic work that dealt with his mother 's suicide ; it appeared in 1972 in Short Order Comix # 1 , which he edited . Spiegelman 's work thereafter went through a phase of increasing formal experimentation ; the Apex Treasury of Underground Comics in 1974 quotes him : " As an art form the comic strip is barely in its infancy . So am I. Maybe we 'll grow up together . " The often @-@ reprinted " Ace Hole , Midget Detective " of 1974 was a Cubist @-@ style nonlinear parody of hardboiled crime fiction full of non sequiturs . " A Day at the Circuits " of 1975 is a recursive single @-@ page strip about alcoholism and depression in which the reader follows the character through multiple never @-@ ending pathways . " Nervous Rex : The Malpractice Suite " of 1976 is made up of cut @-@ out panels from the soap @-@ opera comic strip Rex Morgan , M.D. refashioned in such a way as to defy coherence . 
 In 1973 Spiegelman edited a pornographic and psychedelic book of quotations and dedicated it to his mother . Co @-@ edited with Bob Schneider , it was called Whole Grains : A Book of Quotations . In 1974 – 1975 , he taught a studio cartooning class at the San Francisco Academy of Art . 
 By the mid @-@ 1970s , the underground comix movement was encountering a slowdown . To give cartoonists a safe berth , Spiegelman co @-@ edited the anthology Arcade with Bill Griffith , in 1975 and 1976 . Arcade was printed by The Print Mint and lasted seven issues , five of which had covers by Robert Crumb . It stood out from similar publications by having an editorial plan , in which Spiegelman and Griffith attempt to show how comics connect to the broader realms of artistic and literary culture . Spiegelman 's own work in Arcade tended to be short and concerned with formal experimentation . Arcade also introduced art from ages past , as well as contemporary literary pieces by writers such as William S. Burroughs and Charles Bukowski . In 1975 , Spiegelman moved back to New York City , which put most of the editorial work for Arcade on the shoulders of Griffith and his cartoonist wife , Diane <unk> . This , combined with distribution problems and retailer indifference , led to the magazine 's 1976 demise . For a time , Spiegelman swore he would never edit another magazine . 
 Françoise Mouly , an architectural student on a hiatus from her studies at the Beaux @-@ Arts in Paris , arrived in New York in 1974 . While looking for comics from which to practice reading English , she came across Arcade . Avant @-@ garde filmmaker friend Ken Jacobs introduced Mouly and Spiegelman , when Spiegelman was visiting , but they did not immediately develop a mutual interest . Spiegelman moved back to New York later in the year . Occasionally the two ran across each other . After she read " Prisoner on the Hell Planet " Mouly felt the urge to contact him . An eight @-@ hour phone call led to a deepening of their relationship . Spiegelman followed her to France when she had to return to fulfill obligations in her architecture course . 
 Spiegelman introduced Mouly to the world of comics and helped her find work as a colorist for Marvel Comics . After returning to the US in 1977 , Mouly ran into visa problems , which the couple solved by getting married . The couple began to make yearly trips to Europe to explore the comics scene , and brought back European comics to show to their circle of friends . Mouly assisted in putting together the lavish , oversized collection of Spiegelman 's experimental strips Breakdowns in 1977 . 
 = = = Raw and Maus ( 1978 – 1991 ) = = = 
 Breakdowns suffered poor distribution and sales , and 30 % of the print run was unusable due to printing errors , an experience that motivated Mouly to gain control over the printing process . She took courses in offset printing and bought a printing press for her loft , on which she was to print parts of a new magazine she insisted on launching with Spiegelman . With Mouly as publisher , Spiegelman and Mouly co @-@ edited Raw starting in July 1980 . The first issue was subtitled " The Graphix Magazine of Postponed Suicides " . While it included work from such established underground cartoonists as Crumb and Griffith , Raw focused on publishing artists who were virtually unknown , avant @-@ garde cartoonists such as Charles Burns , Lynda Barry , Chris Ware , Ben <unk> , and Gary Panter , and introduced English @-@ speaking audiences to translations of foreign works by José Muñoz , Chéri Samba , Joost Swarte , Yoshiharu Tsuge , Jacques <unk> , and others . 
 With the intention of creating a book @-@ length work based on his father 's recollections of the Holocaust Spiegelman began to interview his father again in 1978 and made a research visit in 1979 to the Auschwitz concentration camp , where his parents had been imprisoned by the Nazis . The book , Maus , appeared one chapter at a time as an insert in Raw beginning with the second issue in December 1980 . Spiegelman 's father did not live to see its completion ; he died on 18 August 1982 . Spiegelman learned in 1985 that Steven Spielberg was producing an animated film about Jewish mice who escape persecution in Eastern Europe by fleeing to the United States . Spiegelman was sure the film , An American Tail ( 1986 ) , was inspired by Maus and became eager to have his unfinished book come out before the movie to avoid comparisons . He struggled to find a publisher until in 1986 , after the publication in The New York Times of a rave review of the work @-@ in @-@ progress , Pantheon agreed to release a collection of the first six chapters . The volume was titled Maus : A Survivor 's Tale and subtitled My Father <unk> History . The book found a large audience , in part because it was sold in bookstores rather than in direct @-@ market comic shops , which by the 1980s had become the dominant outlet for comic books . 
 Spiegelman began teaching at the School of Visual Arts in New York in 1978 , and continued until 1987 , teaching alongside his heroes Harvey Kurtzman and Will Eisner . Spiegelman had an essay published in Print entitled " <unk> : An <unk> Historical and Aesthetic Overview " . In 1990 Spiegelman he had an essay called " High Art Lowdown " published in Artforum critiquing the High / Low exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art . 
 In the wake of the success of the Cabbage Patch Kids series of dolls , Spiegelman created the card series Garbage Pail Kids for Topps in 1985 . Similar to the Wacky Packages series , the gross @-@ out factor of the cards was controversial with parent groups , and its popularity started a gross @-@ out fad among children . Spiegelman called Topps his " Medici " for the autonomy and financial freedom working for the company had given him . The relationship was nevertheless strained over issues of credit and ownership of the original artwork . In 1989 Topps auctioned off pieces of art Spiegelman had created rather than returning them to him , and Spiegelman broke the relation . 
 In 1991 , Raw Vol . 1 , No.3 was published ; it was to be the last issue . The closing chapter of Maus appeared not in Raw but in the second volume of the graphic novel , which appeared later that year with the subtitle And Here My Troubles Began . Maus attracted an unprecedented amount of critical attention for a work of comics , including an exhibition at New York 's Museum of Modern Art and a special Pulitzer Prize in 1992 . 
 = = = The New Yorker ( 1992 — 2001 ) = = = 
 Hired by Tina Brown as a contributing artist in 1992 , Spiegelman worked for The New Yorker for ten years . Spiegelman 's first cover appeared on the February 15 , 1993 , Valentine 's Day issue and showed a black West Indian woman and a Hasidic man kissing . The cover caused turmoil at The New Yorker offices . Spiegelman intended it to reference the Crown Heights riot of 1991 in which racial tensions led to the murder of a Jewish yeshiva student . Spiegelman had twenty @-@ one New Yorker covers published , and submitted a number which were rejected for being too outrageous . 
 Within The New Yorker 's pages , Spiegelman contributed strips such as a collaboration titled " In the Dumps " with children 's illustrator Maurice Sendak and an obituary to Charles M. Schulz titled " Abstract Thought is a Warm Puppy " . An essay he had published there on Jack Cole , the creator of Plastic Man , called " Forms Stretched to their Limits " was to form the basis for a book in 2001 about Cole called Jack Cole and Plastic Man : Forms Stretched to their Limits . 
 The same year , Voyager Company published a CD @-@ ROM version of Maus with extensive supplementary material called The Complete Maus , and Spiegelman illustrated a 1923 poem by Joseph Moncure March called The Wild Party . Spiegelman contributed the essay " Getting in Touch With My Inner Racist " in the September 1 , 1997 issue of Mother Jones . 
 Spiegelman 's influence and connections in New York cartooning circles drew the ire of political cartoonist Ted Rall in 1999 . In an article titled " The King of Comix " in The Village Voice , Rall accused Spiegelman of the power to " make or break " a cartoonist 's career in New York , while denigrating Spiegelman as " a guy with one great book in him " . Cartoonist Danny Hellman responded by sending a forged email under Rall 's name to thirty professionals ; the prank escalated until Rall launched a defamation suit against Hellman for $ 1 @.@ 5 million . Hellman published a " Legal Action Comics " benefit book to cover his legal costs , to which Spiegelman contributed a back @-@ cover cartoon in which he relieves himself on a Rall @-@ shaped urinal . 
 In 1997 , Spiegelman 's had his first children 's book published : Open Me ... I 'm a Dog , with a narrator who tries to convince its readers that it is a dog via pop @-@ ups and an attached leash . From 2000 to 2003 Spiegelman and Mouly edited three issues of the children 's comics anthology Little Lit , with contributions from Raw alumni and children 's book authors and illustrators . 
 = = = Post @-@ September 11 ( 2001 – present ) = = = 
 Spiegelman lived close to the World Trade Center site , which was known as " Ground Zero " after the September 11 attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center . Immediately following the attacks Spiegelman and Mouly rushed to their daughter Nadja 's school , where Spiegelman 's anxiety served only to increase his daughter 's <unk> over the situation . Spiegelman and Mouly created a cover for the September 24 issue of The New Yorker which at first glance appears to be totally black , but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of the World Trade Center towers in a slightly darker shade of black . Mouly positioned the silhouettes so that the North Tower 's antenna breaks into the " W " of The New Yorker 's logo . The towers were printed in black on a slightly darker black field employing standard four @-@ color printing inks with an overprinted clear varnish . In some situations , the ghost images only became visible when the magazine was tilted toward a light source . Spiegelman was critical of the Bush administration and the mass media over their handling of the September 11 attacks . 
 Spiegelman did not renew his New Yorker contract after 2003 . He later quipped that he regretted leaving when he did , as he could have left in protest when the magazine ran a pro @-@ invasion of Iraq piece later in the year . Spiegelman said his parting from The New Yorker was part of his general disappointment with " the widespread conformism of the mass media in the Bush era " . He said he felt like he was in " internal exile " following September 11 attacks as the US media had become " conservative and timid " and did not welcome the provocative art that he felt the need to create . Nevertheless , Spiegelman asserted he left not over political differences , as had been widely reported , but because The New Yorker was not interested in doing serialized work , which he wanted to do with his next project . 
 Spiegelman responded to the September 11 attacks with In the Shadow of No Towers , commissioned by German newspaper Die Zeit , where it appeared throughout 2003 . The Jewish Daily Forward was the only American periodical to serialize the feature . The collected work appeared in September 2004 as an oversized board book of two @-@ page spreads which had to be turned on end to read . 
 In the June 2006 edition of Harper 's Magazine Spiegelman had an article published on the Jyllands @-@ Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy ; some interpretations of Islamic law prohibit the depiction of Muhammad . The Canadian chain of booksellers Indigo refused to sell the issue . Called " Drawing Blood : Outrageous Cartoons and the Art of Outrage " , the article surveyed the sometimes dire effect political cartooning has for its creators , ranging from Honoré Daumier , who spent time in prison for his satirical work ; to George Grosz , who faced exile . To Indigo the article seemed to promote the continuance of racial caricature . An internal memo advised Indigo staff to tell people : " the decision was made based on the fact that the content about to be published has been known to ignite demonstrations around the world . " In response to the cartoons , Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called for submissions of antisemitic cartoons . Spiegelman produced a cartoon of a line of prisoners being led to the gas chambers ; one stops to look at the corpses around him and says , " Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! What ’ s really hilarious is that none of this is actually happening ! " 
 To promote literacy in young children , Mouly encouraged publishers to publish comics for children . Disappointed by publishers ' lack of response , from 2008 she self @-@ published a line of easy readers called Toon Books , by artists such as Spiegelman , Renée French , and <unk> <unk> , and promotes the books to teachers and librarians for their educational value . Spiegelman 's Jack and the Box was one of the inaugural books in 2008 . 
 In 2008 Spiegelman reissued Breakdowns in an expanded edition including " Portrait of the Artist as a Young % @ & * ! " an autobiographical strip that had been serialized in the Virginia Quarterly Review from 2005 . A volume drawn from Spiegelman 's sketchbooks , Be A Nose , appeared in 2009 . In 2011 MetaMaus followed — a book @-@ length analysis of Maus by Spiegelman and Hillary Chute with a DVD @-@ ROM update of the earlier CD @-@ ROM . 
 Library of America commissioned Spiegelman to edit the two @-@ volume Lynd Ward : Six Novels in Woodcuts , which appeared in 2010 , collecting all of Ward 's wordless novels with an introduction and annotations by Spiegelman . The project led to a touring show in 2014 about wordless novels called Wordless ! with live music by saxophonist Phillip Johnston . Art Spiegelman 's Co @-@ Mix : A Retrospective débuted at Angoulême in 2012 and by the end of 2014 had traveled to Paris , Cologne , Vancouver , New York , and Toronto . A book complementing the showed titled Co @-@ Mix : A Retrospective of Comics , Graphics , and Scraps appeared in 2013 . 
 In 2015 , after six writers refused to sit on a panel at the PEN American Center in protest of the planned " freedom of expression courage award " for the satirical French periodical Charlie Hebdo following the shooting at its headquarters earlier in the year , Spiegelman agreed to be one of the replacement hosts , along with other names in comics such as writer Neil Gaiman . Spiegelman retracted a cover he had submitted to a Gaiman @-@ edited " saying the <unk> " issue of New Statesman when the management declined to print strip of Spiegelman 's . The strip , titled " Notes from a First Amendment Fundamentalist " , depicts Muhammad , and Spiegelman believed the rejection was censorship , though the magazine asserted it never intended to run the cartoon .

 Spiegelman married Françoise Mouly on July 12 , 1977 , in a City Hall ceremony . They remarried later in the year after Mouly converted to Judaism to please Spiegelman 's father . Mouly and Spiegelman have two children together : a daughter Nadja Rachel , born in 1987 , and a son Dashiell Alan , born in 1992 . 
 = = Style = = 
 " All comic @-@ strip drawings must function as diagrams , simplified picture @-@ words that indicate more than they show . " 
 Spiegelman suffers from a lazy eye , and thus lacks depth perception . He says his art style is " really a result of [ his ] deficiencies " . His is a style of labored simplicity , with dense visual motifs which often go unnoticed upon first viewing . He sees comics as " very condensed thought structures " , more akin to poetry than prose , which need careful , time @-@ consuming planning that their seeming simplicity <unk> 's work prominently displays his concern with form , and pushing the boundaries of what is and is not comics . Early in the underground comix era , Spiegelman proclaimed to Robert Crumb , " Time is an illusion that can be shattered in comics ! Showing the same scene from different angles freezes it in time by turning the page into a diagram — an orthographic projection ! " His comics experiment with time , space , recursion , and representation . He uses the word " decode " to express the action of reading comics and sees comics as functioning best when expressed as diagrams , icons , or symbols . 
 Spiegelman has stated he does not see himself primarily as a visual artist , one who instinctively sketches or doodles . He has said he approaches his work as a writer as he lacks confidence in his graphic skills . He subjects his dialogue and visuals to constant revision — he reworked some dialogue balloons in Maus up to forty times . A critic in The New Republic compared Spiegelman 's dialogue writing to a young Philip Roth in his ability " to make the Jewish speech of several generations sound fresh and convincing " . 
 Spiegelman makes use of both old- and new @-@ fashioned tools in his work . He prefers at times to work on paper on a drafting table , while at others he draws directly onto his computer using a digital pen and electronic drawing tablet , or mixes methods , employing scanners and printers . 
 = = = Influences = = = 
 Harvey Kurtzman has been Spiegelman 's strongest influence as a cartoonist , editor , and promoter of new talent . Chief among his other early cartooning influences include Will Eisner , John Stanley 's version of Little Lulu , Winsor McCay 's Little Nemo , George Herriman 's Krazy Kat , and Bernard <unk> 's short strip " Master Race " . 
 In the 1960s Spiegelman read in comics fanzines about graphic artists such as Frans Masereel , who had made wordless novels in woodcut . The discussions in those fanzines about making the Great American Novel in comics later acted as inspiration for him . Justin Green 's comic book Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary ( 1972 ) motivated Spiegelman to open up and include autobiographical elements in his comics . 
 Spiegelman acknowledges Franz Kafka as an early influence , whom he says he has read since the age of 12 , and lists Vladimir Nabokov , William Faulkner , Gertrude Stein among the writers whose work " stayed with " him . He cites non @-@ narrative avant @-@ garde filmmakers from whom he has drawn heavily , including Ken Jacobs , Stan Brakhage , and Ernie Gehr , and other filmmakers such as Charlie Chaplin and the makers of The Twilight Zone . 
 = = Beliefs = = 
 Spiegelman is a prominent advocate for the comics medium and comics literacy . He believes the medium echoes the way the human brain processes information . He has toured the US with a lecture called " Comix 101 " , examining its history and cultural importance . He sees comics ' low status in the late 20th century as having come down from where it was in the 1930s and 1940s , when comics " tended to appeal to an older audience of GIs and other adults " . Following the advent of the censorious Comics Code Authority in the mid @-@ 1950s , Spiegelman sees comics ' potential as having stagnated until the rise of underground comix in the late 1960s . He taught courses in the history and aesthetics of comics at schools such as the School of Visual Arts in New York . As co @-@ editor of Raw , he helped propel the careers of younger cartoonists whom he mentored , such as Chris Ware , and published the work of his School of Visual Arts students , such as Kaz , Drew Friedman , and Mark <unk> . Some of the work published in Raw was originally turned in as class assignments . 
 Spiegelman has described himself politically as " firmly on the left side of the secular @-@ fundamentalist divide " and a " 1st Amendment absolutist " . As a supporter of free speech Spiegelman is opposed to hate speech laws . He wrote a critique in Harper 's on the controversial Muhammad cartoons in the Jyllands @-@ Posten in 2006 ; the issue was banned from Indigo – Chapters stores in Canada . Spiegelman criticized American media for refusing to reprint the cartoons they reported on at the time of the Charlie Hebdo shooting in 2015 . 
 Spiegelman is a non @-@ practicing Jew and considers himself " a @-@ Zionist " — neither pro- nor anti @-@ Zionist ; he has called Israel " a sad , failed idea " . He told Charles Schulz he was not religious , but identified with the " alienated diaspora culture of Kafka and Freud ... what Stalin pejoratively called rootless cosmopolitanism " — a statement Ezra Mendelsohn interpreted as identification with " the Jewish spirit of universalism as championed by the greatest of Jewry 's creative figures " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Maus looms large not only over Spiegelman 's body of work , but over the comics medium itself . While Spiegelman was far from the first to do autobiography in comics , critics such as James Campbell considered Maus the work that popularized it . The bestseller has been widely written about in the popular press and academia — the quantity of its critical literature far outstrips that of any other work of comics . It has been examined from a great variety of academic viewpoints , though most often by those with little understanding of Maus 's context in the history of comics . While Maus has been credited with lifting comics from popular culture into the world of high art in the public imagination , criticism has tended to ignore its deep roots in popular culture , roots that Spiegelman has intimate familiarity with and has devoted considerable time to promote . 
 Spiegelman 's belief that comics are best expressed in a diagrammatic or iconic manner has had a particular influence on <unk> such as Chris Ware and his former student Scott McCloud . In 2005 , the September 11 @-@ themed New Yorker cover placed sixth on the top ten of magazine covers of the previous 40 years by the American Society of Magazine Editors . Spiegelman has inspired numerous cartoonists to take up the graphic novel as a means of expression , including Marjane Satrapi . 
 A joint ZDF – BBC documentary Art Spiegelman 's Maus was televised in 1987 . Spiegelman , Mouly , and many of the Raw artists appeared in the video documentary Comic Book Confidential in 1988 . Spiegelman played himself in the 2007 episode " Husbands and Knives " of the animated television series The Simpsons with other comics creators Daniel Clowes and Alan Moore . A European documentary Art Spiegelman , Traits de Mémoire appeared in 2010 and later in English under the title The Art of Spiegelman , directed by Clara <unk> and <unk> <unk> and mainly featuring interviews with <unk> and those around him .

 = Persian Gulf campaign of 1809 = 
 The Persian Gulf Campaign , in 1809 , was an operation by a British Royal Navy to force the Al Qasimi to cease their raids on British ships in the Persian Gulf , particularly on the Persian and Arab coasts of the Straits of Hormuz . The operation 's success was limited as the Royal Navy forces , already heavily involved in the Napoleonic Wars , were unable to permanently suppress the strong fleets of the Al Qasimi of Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah . The expedition did achieve its short @-@ term goals by destroying three Al Qasimi bases and over 80 vessels , including the largest Al Qasimi ship in the region , the converted merchant ship Minerva . Although operations continued into 1810 , the British were unable to destroy every Al Qasimi vessel and by 1811 attacks had resumed , although at a lower intensity than previously . 
 Although characterised at the time and since as actions against piracy , this charge has been disputed by historians and archivists in the UAE in particular , notably the current Ruler of Sharjah , HH Dr Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi in his book ' The Myth of Arabian Piracy in the Gulf ' . The counter @-@ argument is that the Al Qasimi , a strong and independent maritime force , were the subject of British aggression in an attempt to stamp its authority - and that of its Omani allies - on trade routes thought of as important to Iraq and India . 
 The operation against the Al Qasimi was a joint campaign by the Royal Navy and the fleet of the Honourable East India Company ( HEIC ) , with soldiers drawn from the garrison of Bombay . The expeditionary force , led by Captain John Wainwright in the Navy frigate HMS Chiffone , was despatched to the region , following an escalation in attacks on British shipping in the Persian Gulf after the French established diplomatic missions in Muscat and Tehran in 1807 . These attacks not only threatened British trade links in the region , but also placed British relations with Oman and Persia in jeopardy at a time when French aspirations against British India were a cause for concern to the British government . 
 Because the available charts of the Persian Gulf were inaccurate or incomplete at the time , Al Qasimi ships could hide from Wainwright 's squadron in the uncharted inlets , a problem Wainwright reported upon his return that resulted in improved British cartography of the area . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the early nineteenth century , the Indian Ocean was an important link in the trade routes from British India to the United Kingdom , and Honourable East India Company ( HEIC ) merchant ships , known as East Indiamen , regularly crossed the ocean carrying millions of pounds worth of goods . One of the most important ports for the Indian trade was Bombay , on the western coast of the Indian subcontinent , a significant hub for regional trade with its links to the Persian and Arab ports of the Persian Gulf . The ships that traded in the Persian Gulf were named " country ships " and were much smaller and weaker than the big East Indiamen . The British had long maintained a naval presence in the region , but the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803 diverted much of the British strength in the Indian Ocean to the Dutch colonies of the Cape of Good Hope and Java and the French bases on Île Bonaparte and Île de France , leaving the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea largely undefended . In addition , convoy guardships were needed to escort the East Indiamen through hostile waters and the Navy presence in the Gulf was replaced by warships owned by the HEIC , part of their private fleet nicknamed the " Bombay Marine " . 
 Like the Royal Navy , the Bombay Marine were spread across many thousands of miles of ocean , often leaving the country ships in the Persian Gulf undefended . As French raiders were rare in the Gulf , few country ships operated in convoys and so they became targets for dhows and bhagalas operating from semi or completely independent harbours in Persia or along the Arabian Peninsula . In 1805 , the fleets of Al Qasimi captured two large ships , Shannon and Trimmer ; the small boats of the Al Qasimi , swarmed the larger merchant ships and massacred the crews . The Al Qasimi converted Trimmer into a formidable pirate ship . When the HEIC warship Mornington , which carried 24 cannon , attempted to recapture Trimmer a few months later , nearly 40 Al Qasimi vessels attacked Mornington , which only just managed to escape destruction herself . 
 = = = Diplomatic failures = = = 
 Lacking the available naval forces to launch a sizeable campaign in the Gulf , the British authorities attempted to use diplomacy to end the threat . In February 1806 , the young Sultan of Oman , Sa 'id II ibn Sultan , signed a treaty at Bandar Abbas promising to bring an end to attacks originating from his territory , but by 1807 the French had installed consulates in Tehran and Muscat and attacks continued unabated with their encouragement . In 1807 , Lord Minto , Governor General of India , determined to send ambassadors to the Sikh Empire , Afghanistan and Persia in an effort to secure their support and prevent the French from gaining allies on India 's western borders . As part of this diplomatic campaign , the ambassador to Persia was instructed to discuss the problem with the Persian government , but due to French influence in Tehran , he was unable to obtain any guarantees . 
 A second diplomatic mission , sent from London in 1808 under Sir Harford Jones , was instructed to discuss the issue again , Jones deciding to travel to Bushire in Persia by sea . The diplomatic convoy consisted of the frigate HMS Nereide and two HEIC sloops , Sylph and Sapphire . The convoy was commanded by Captain Robert Corbet , who refused to wait for the slower sloops once the force had reached the Persian Gulf . Nereide arrived at Bushire on 14 October 1808 . Jones completed his journey by land . Corbet returned south to the Straits of Hormuz , expecting to meet the sloops on his return journey . On 21 October , however , he discovered Sylph in the hands of Al Qasimi , who had swarmed the isolated warship , captured her and massacred her crew . Corbet was able to recapture the vessel and later rejoined Sapphire , which had been detached to conduct survey 's of the Persian coast , but the operation demonstrated that it was the pirates who now controlled the Southern Persian Gulf . 
 = = = Al Qasimi in the Arabian Sea = = = 
 In April 1808 , despite the brief deployment of the ship of the line HMS Albion and frigates HMS Phaeton and HMS Dedaigneuse to the Persian Gulf , Al Qasimi dhows appeared off <unk> , raiding shipping at Surat before they were driven off by ships of the Bombay Marine . Later in the year , a huge fleet of 50 raiders appeared off Sind in the Arabian Sea and caused severe disruption to the regional trade . The fleet attacked merchant shipping along the Indian coast and even seized a large country ship named Minerva , massacring her crew and converting her into their flagship . At its height in early 1809 , it was estimated that the Al Qasimi forces in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea included 60 large bhagalas , over 800 dhows , and employed 19 @,@ 000 men , against just two HEIC ships , Mornington and Teignmouth . 
 = = British operations = = 
 In the aftermath of the raid on Sind and following the 1809 monsoon season , the British authorities in India decided to make a significant show of force against the Al Qasimi , in an effort not only to destroy their larger bases and as many ships as could be found , but also to counteract French encouragement of them from their embassies in Persia and Oman . Forces were gathered at Bombay during the summer : the small HEIC warships , Mornington , Aurora , Ternate , Mercury , Nautilus , Prince of Wales , Ariel and Fury joined by the bomb ketch Stromboli and the Royal Navy frigates HMS Caroline under Charles Gordon and Chiffone under John Wainwright , who was placed in command of the entire expeditionary force with the temporary rank of commodore . The force was complemented with troops seconded from the Bombay garrison , including a battalion of the 65th Foot , soldiers from the 47th Foot and an assortment of HEIC marines , engineers , artillery men and sepoys from the 2nd Bombay Native Infantry under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lionel Smith of the 65th . 
 The expeditionary force left Bombay on 17 September , intending to rendezvous at Muscat the following week . However , the force was repeatedly delayed during their passage , first with providing escorts to convoys of country ships in the Arabian Sea and subsequently with rescuing survivors of the Stromboli , which was so rotten that she fell apart in the ocean swell with considerable loss of life . When the force eventually arrived at Muscat in October , Sultan Sa 'id informed Wainwright that over 20 @,@ 000 Bedouin warriors had descended on the coast to join the Al Qasimi . Understanding that a protracted land campaign would be impossible with the forces available , Wainwright determined to make a series of small raids against the principle pirate bases in the area of the Straits of Hormuz , beginning with Ras al @-@ Khaimah , to the north of the Strait on the Arabian coast . 
 = = = Battle of Ras al @-@ Khaimah = = = 
 The British flotilla arrived off the independent town of Ras al @-@ Khaimah on 11 November , discovering Minerva and a fleet of dhows in the harbour . The pirate fleet initially sailed out to attack the British but retreated once the size of the expeditionary force became clear . Minerva failed to make the return to port successfully and was wrecked on a sandbank , the crew setting fire to their ship to prevent her seizure by boats launched from Chiffone . Onshore , the Al Qasimi and their Bedouin allies ( whose numbers are unknown , but were significantly less than 20 @,@ 000 ) formed a series of emplaced defences around the town that were protected from offshore bombardment by sandbanks which blocked the approach of Wainwright 's heavier warships . On 12 November , Wainwright deployed his smaller ships close inshore to bombard the town and provide cover for his troop dispositions offshore . 
 At 02 : 00 on 13 November , two squadrons of ship 's boats made amphibious landings : a small force under Lieutenant Samuel Leslie landed to the north of the emplaced positions , acting as a diversion while the main body of the expeditionary force landed to the south under Lieutenant Colonel Smith . Leslie 's diversion distracted the Arab defenders , but enough remained in the southern defences to make a significant counterattack on Smith 's beachhead . Cannon fire from the ship 's boats covering the landing drove the Arabs back , and Smith ordered his men to advance with their bayonets fixed , pushing into the town and driving out the Arabs house by house . To cover their advance , Smith 's men set fire to the buildings in their path , which created a pall of smoke under cover of which Smith was able to storm and capture the Sheik 's palace . 
 With the harbour secure , Wainwright ordered the squadron into the bay and there burnt over 50 Al Qasimi craft , including 30 large bhagalas . Smith secured the town itself , burning warehouses and destroying the ammunition stores and fortifications around the town . The Arab forces , who had retreated after the fall of the palace , taunted the British from the surrounding hills but did not make any counterattacks . By the morning of 14 November , the operation was complete and the British force returned to their ships , having suffered light casualties of five killed and 34 wounded . Arab losses are unknown , but were probably significant , while the damage done to the Al Qasimi fleets was severe : over half of the largest and most dangerous vessels had been destroyed at Ras al @-@ Khaimah . 
 = = = Further operations = = = 
 On 17 November , Wainwright ordered an attack on the Persian town of Linga , the inhabitants fleeing at the arrival of the British fleet , and Wainwright 's ships burning 20 dhows without opposition or casualties . Further exploration on the Southern Persian coast revealed that most harbours were empty . Wainwright 's main target was <unk> on Qeshm Island , which was a principal Al Qasimi stronghold . Sending ships to block the passages to the Qeshm Channel , Wainwright hired local pilots and descended on the town on 26 November . Following fruitless negotiations with local sheiks , Wainwright ordered an attack on 27 November at 14 : 00 , Smith 's troops landing unopposed . Assuming the enemy to have fled , Smith 's men approached the town 's fortress , but a heavy fire was unleashed upon them as the British troops reached the gate . Despite heavy casualties , Smith was able to rally his forces and , with artillery support from the sloop Fury , forced the fort to surrender at sunset , after the sheik had been given guarantees he would not be harmed or taken prisoner . Eleven large Arab vessels were burnt by British landing parties , while the expeditionary force suffered 70 casualties in the fight at the fort . Arab losses were estimated at more than 50 killed in the fort alone . 
 The town was turned over to Sheik Dewar , a local ruler who professed support for the British , and Wainwright withdrew his forces to Muscat in early December ; all of the squadron reassembled there by Christmas . Only one further operation was launched , a successful attack on 3 January 1810 against the town of <unk> , which had rebelled against Sultan Sa 'id and was swiftly recaptured and restored to him . Although minor naval operations against individual local ships continued into 1810 , Wainwright and the main body of the squadron returned to Bombay in January , having considered their mission to inflict significant damage on the Al Qasimi forces in the Persian Gulf to have been a success . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The operation succeeded in its aim of reducing French influence in Oman and in dissuading the political forces in the region from encouraging attacks on British shipping , but it was unable to totally halt Al Qasimi activity in the Persian Gulf . By 1811 , when much of the Royal Navy and HEIC forces in the Indian Ocean were diverted to Java , the Al Qasimi returned in force , although their destructive actions were weaker than before and rarely strayed into the Arabian Sea . Ultimately , it was not until the forces of the Ottoman Empire seized Medina in 1812 , that some measure of control could be exerted over the tribes of the Arabian peninsula . Subsequent British intervention , both military and diplomatic , also reduced the threat of attacks during the nineteenth century . 
 The campaign had a significant effect on British cartography of the region . Wainwright reported that the available charts of the Persian Gulf were inaccurate or incomplete , thus allowing Al Qasimi ships to hide from his squadron in uncharted inlets . The Bombay Marine had long been aware of this problem and had been developing charts of the region in the years leading up to the campaign , under David Ewen Bartholomew , who had been on Sapphire during Corbet 's mission to the region and whose charts were published in 1810 as a response to these problems . 
 = SS West Cheswald = 
 SS West Cheswald was a cargo ship for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) launched shortly after the end of World War I. The ship was inspected by the United States Navy for possible use as USS West Cheswald ( ID @-@ 4199 ) but was neither taken into the Navy nor ever commissioned under that name . West Cheswald was built in 1919 for the USSB , as a part of the West boats , a series of steel @-@ hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort , and was the 32nd ship built at Northwest Steel in Portland , Oregon . 
 She operated for several years as a merchant ship , and was involved in a court case that eventually reached the Supreme Court of the United States in 1928 . She was laid up in New Orleans , Louisiana , until late 1940 when she was reactivated and refitted to carry American defense @-@ related cargos to Africa and chromium and manganese ore to the United States . 
 Continuing in African service after the United States entered World War II , she was diverted in March 1942 for one round trip to the Soviet Union , enduring German attacks that earned her U.S. Navy Armed Guard a battle star . After her return , she sailed mainly between the United States and African and Caribbean ports . In March 1944 , she sailed from the United States for the final time , and was scuttled in June as part of the " gooseberry " breakwater off Utah Beach during the Normandy invasion , earning a second battle star in the process . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 The West ships were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) for emergency use during World War I. All were given names that began with the word West , like West Cheswald , the one of some 40 West ships built by the Northwest Steel of Portland , Oregon . West Cheswald ( Northwest Steel yard number 32 , USSB hull number 1421 ) was completed in September 1919 . 
 West Cheswald was 6 @,@ 187 gross register tons ( GRT ) , and was 412 feet 1 inch ( 125 @.@ 60 m ) long ( between perpendiculars ) and 54 feet 6 inches ( 16 @.@ 61 m ) abeam . She had a steel hull with a hold that was 29 feet 9 inches ( 9 @.@ 07 m ) deep . She had a displacement of 12 @,@ 200 t with a mean draft of 24 feet 1 inch ( 7 @.@ 34 m ) . The ship had a single steam turbine that drove a single screw propeller , and moved the ship at up to 11 @.@ 5 knots ( 21 @.@ 3 km / h ) . 
 = = Early career = = 
 West Cheswald was inspected by the 13th Naval District of the United States Navy after completion for possible use as a service collier and was assigned the identification number of 4199 . Had she been commissioned , she would have been known as USS West Cheswald ( ID @-@ 4199 ) , but the Navy neither took over the ship nor commissioned her . 
 Information on West Cheswald 's early career is lacking , but records of some of her movements and cargo are available . On 30 September 1920 , West Cheswald took on a load of white sugar at Java and headed for the United States via the Suez Canal . While she was near Bermuda , West Cheswald was diverted from her original destination of New York to Philadelphia , to deliver her cargo in fulfillment of an order . Because the cargo had not been originally headed to Philadelphia , the purchasers refused to pay for it , believing that the voyage took too long . After litigation and various appeals , the case ended up before the Supreme Court of the United States in 1928 as Lamborn v. National Bank of Commerce , 276 U.S. 469 ( 1928 ) . The court found that under the contract signed , the purchasers were obligated for the sugar regardless of whether or not the ship had originally been destined for Philadelphia . West Cheswald was also reported in Hawaiian service during 1920 . The report of the Governor of Hawaii in the annual report of the United States Department of the Interior for the 1920 – 21 fiscal year , listed West Cheswald among the four USSB @-@ owned ships sailed to Hawaii by the Pacific Steamship Company . 
 From 1922 , West Cheswald operated to South America , often bringing coffee to the United States . In October 1922 , for example , she delivered 22 @,@ 700 pounds ( 10 @,@ 300 kg ) of coffee from Rio de Janeiro to New Orleans , Louisiana , and in March 1923 , she delivered 105 @,@ 400 bags to New Orleans and another 4 @,@ 100 bags to Galveston , Texas . From 1923 to 1940 , little is known about West Cheswald 's activities . At some point during this period , she was laid up in New Orleans as part of the reserve fleet located there . 
 = = World War II = = 
 In June 1940 , as World War II raged in Europe , the United States Maritime Commission ( USMC ) ( a successor to the USSB ) announced bidding for the reconditioning of West Cheswald and nine other ships that were in the reserve fleet . The low bid for West Cheswald was by the Maryland Drydock Company of Baltimore , which priced the repairs at $ 169 @,@ 961 . In February 1941 , the USMC announced another round of bidding , this time for the operation of West Cheswald and three other ships on defense routes to southern and eastern Africa . The ships would carry defense cargo to African ports and return loads of chromium and manganese ore — both needed for the production of steel for armaments — to the United States . The American South African Line had the low bid for West Cheswald , offering to operate her for $ 17 @,@ 174 monthly . 
 With her reconditioning complete , West Cheswald arrived in New York from Baltimore on 23 March . Although she may have been scheduled to begin her African service as early as 29 March , she sailed from New York on 11 April for the Cape Verde Islands , and from there , to Cape Town , where she arrived on 15 May . Beginning the next day , West Cheswald visited Port Elizabeth , East London , Durban , Mombasa , Tanga , and Zanzibar through 11 June . She returned to Tanga , then sailed from Dar es Salaam to Zanzibar and back on 23 and 24 June . She next made her way to Lourenço Marques , where she arrived on 3 July . From Lourenço Marques , she sailed back to Durban and Cape Town , before she began her transatlantic journey to Trinidad on 18 July . After calling at that Caribbean port , she returned to New York to complete her first circuit on 18 August . 
 On 6 September , West Cheswald began another , similar voyage to Africa . In addition to calling at many of the same ports she visited on her first trip , she visited the port of Beira , Mozambique for the first time in early November . The ship was in transit from Cape Town to Trinidad on 7 December during the Attack on Pearl Harbor , and by the time she arrived at Boston on 27 December , the United States had joined the Allies of World War II in declaring war against the Axis powers . 
 = = Arctic convoy = = 
 West Cheswald sailed from Boston for New York on 30 December , and spent nearly eight weeks at New York . Outfitted with armament and a Naval Armed Guard detachment , she sailed from Boston for Halifax with a load of tanks on 23 February 1942 . After spending five days at Halifax , she sailed as part of Convoy SC 72 to Clyde on 28 February . After arriving at Clyde on 17 March , West Cheswald made her way to Oban on 22 March and sailed four days later for Murmansk as part of Convoy PQ 14 . The convoy consisted of approximately 25 merchant ships , ten of which were American , and of the American ships , only two — West Cheswald and Yaka — possessed defensive weaponry manned by Naval Armed Guardsmen . Many ships turned back because of heavy fog and snow ; West Cheswald , Yaka and several other ships from the convoy remained at Reykjavík from 31 March to 8 April . On 15 April , the convoy was tracked by a German aircraft , and convoy escort ships made contact with three German destroyers . The following day , the convoy commodore 's ship was sunk by a submarine ; at least two other torpedoes traveled through the convoy without hitting any ships . The convoy came under air attack on 17 April , but suffered no losses . As the convoy neared Murmansk , two Soviet destroyers with air cover joined the escort , and the convoy arrived without further incident on 19 April . 
 Though the convoy had arrived at its destination , the danger of attack was still present . The nearest German airfield was 35 miles ( 56 km ) away — about 7 to 10 minutes flying time — which gave almost no advance warning of air raids . German dive bombers would silently glide in below Soviet anti @-@ aircraft fire , drop their bombs , and fly away . West Cheswald was luckier than some . Her closest call occurred when a bomb fell 50 feet ( 15 m ) away from the ship during an air raid on 23 April , destroying a 50 @-@ ton crane that had earlier finished unloading the ship ; West Cheswald suffered no major damage in any of the attacks . Despite the fact that Murmansk had limited port facilities and typically slow unloading of cargo , West Cheswald was ready to sail in the next departing convoy , Convoy QP 11 , on 28 April . West Cheswald 's armed guardsmen received a battle star for their participation in Convoy PQ 14 . 
 = = Later voyages = = 
 After returning to New York on 31 May by way of Reykjavík and Halifax , West Cheswald made a brief trip to Philadelphia and back before she worked her way down the East Coast to Norfolk , Virginia , where she arrived on 17 June . Sailing the next day , the cargo ship began the first of two African trips , during which she made many of the same ports as in her two 1941 voyages . On the homeward leg of her second voyage , she called at Takoradi and Freetown on the western coast of Africa in March 1943 . After returning to the Americas , West Cheswald visited Saint Thomas , San Juan , and Mayagüez in the Caribbean before returning to Philadelphia on 28 April . 
 West Cheswald 's next sailing began on 6 June , when she left Boston for Halifax , sailing from the latter port on 16 June in Convoy SC @-@ 134 bound for Liverpool . Breaking off from the convoy for Loch Ewe , West Cheswald also visited Methil , Southend , and Oban , before returning to New York on 11 August . Sailing from there on 6 September , she began her final trip to Africa , in which she visited the West African ports of Bathurst , Freetown , Monrovia , and Takoradi before returning to Philadelphia via Trinidad on 27 January 1944 . She sailed from Philadelphia ten days later , ending up in Boston . 
 = = Final voyage = = 
 West Cheswald had been selected to become one of the blockships for the Allied invasion of France , then in the planning stages . Though the specific modifications performed on West Cheswald are not revealed in sources , modifications for other ships do appear . In November 1944 , The Christian Science Monitor reported that blockships dispatched from Boston , like West Cheswald , had been loaded with " tons of sand and cement " and had been rigged with explosive charges before departing the port . Further , existing antiaircraft weapons had been moved higher up on the ship and supplemented by additional guns . An account by Cesar Poropat , chief engineer aboard West Honaker , another blockship dispatched from Boston , mentions that transverse bulkheads aboard that ship were cut open to facilitate sinking . 
 West Cheswald departed Boston on 10 March and arrived at Halifax two days later . Departing from that port on 29 March , she sailed in Convoy SC @-@ 156 and arrived at Swansea on 14 April . She departed there on 30 April for Oban , where she joined the assembling " Corncob Fleet . " The Corncob Fleet was the group of ships to be sunk to form the " gooseberries " , shallow @-@ water artificial harbors for landing craft . Poropat reports that once the ship crews were told of their mission while anchored at Oban , they were not permitted to leave the ships . After five weeks of isolation at anchor , West Cheswald headed south for Poole , to join the first corncob convoy . 
 West Cheswald sailed from Poole on 7 June in a convoy , consisting of what one author called the " dregs of the North Atlantic shipping pool " , and reached the Normandy beachhead the next day , two days after the D @-@ Day landings . Poropat reports that the corncob ships traveled under cover of darkness and , stripped of all unnecessary equipment , carried no radios , having only a signal lamp ( with a spare bulb ) for communication . Once at the designated location , the ships were put into position and scuttled over the next days , under heavy German artillery fire . Naval Armed Guardsmen manned the guns on all the gooseberry ships to protect against frequent German air attacks ; West Cheswald 's gunners were credited with downing one plane on 10 June . All the while , harbor pilots — about half of the New York Bar Pilots Association , according to one source — carefully positioned the ships . West Cheswald and West Nohno were the last two ships sunk off Utah Beach when they went down on 11 June . Even though she had been sunk , West Cheswald continued to serve as an antiaircraft platform manned by Navy gun crews until 19 June , and by Army crews after that date . West Cheswald 's naval gunners were awarded a second battle star for participation in the Normandy Landings . 
 = Teleost = 
 The teleosts or Teleostei ( Greek : <unk> , " complete " + osteon , " bone " ) are by far the largest infraclass in the class Actinopterygii , the ray @-@ finned fishes , and make up 96 percent of all fish . This diverse group arose in the Triassic period and members are arranged in about 40 orders and 448 families . Over 26 @,@ 000 species have been described . Teleosts range from giant oarfish , measuring 25 ft ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) or more , and ocean sunfish weighing over 2 @.@ 0 long tons ; 2 @.@ 2 short tons ( 2 t ) , to the minute male anglerfish <unk> <unk> , just 0 @.@ 24 in ( 6 @.@ 2 mm ) long . As well as torpedo @-@ shaped fish built for speed , teleosts can be flattened vertically or horizontally , be elongated cylinders or take specialised shapes as in anglerfish and seahorses . Teleosts dominate the seas from pole to pole and inhabit the ocean depths , estuaries , rivers , lakes and even swamps . 
 The difference between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones ; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications in the jaw musculature which make it possible for them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth . This is of great advantage , enabling them to grab prey and draw it into the mouth . In more derived teleosts , the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth @-@ bearing bone and the maxilla , which is attached to the lower jaw , acts as a lever , pushing and pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is opened and closed . Other bones further back in the mouth serve to grind and swallow food . Another difference is that the upper and lower lobes of the tail ( caudal ) fin are about equal in size . The spine ends at the caudal peduncle , distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the tail fin . 
 Teleosts have adopted a range of reproductive strategies . Most use external fertilisation : the female lays a batch of eggs , the male fertilises them and the larvae develop without any further parental involvement . A fair proportion of teleosts are hermaphrodites , starting life as females and transitioning to males at some stage , with a few species reversing this process . A small percentage of teleosts are viviparous and some provide parental care with typically the male fish guarding a nest and fanning the eggs to keep them well @-@ oxygenated . 
 Teleosts are economically important to humans as is shown by their depiction in art over the centuries . The fishing industry harvests them for food and anglers attempt to capture them for sport . Some species are farmed commercially , and this method of production is likely to be increasingly important in the future . Others are kept in aquaria or used in research , especially in the fields of genetics and developmental biology . 
 = = Anatomy = = 
 The defining features of the teleosts are mobile premaxilla , elongated neural arches at the end of the caudal fin and unpaired basibranchial <unk> . The premaxilla is unattached to the neurocranium ( braincase ) ; it plays a role in protruding the mouth and creating a circular opening . This lowers the pressure inside the mouth , sucking the prey inside . The lower jaw and maxilla are then pulled back to close the mouth , and the fish is able to grasp the prey . By contrast , mere closure of the jaws would risk pushing food out of the mouth . In more derived teleosts , the premaxilla is enlarged and has teeth , while the maxilla is toothless . The maxilla functions to push both the premaxilla and the lower jaw forward . To open the mouth , an adductor muscle pulls back the top of the maxilla , pushing the lower jaw forward . In addition , the maxilla rotates slightly , which pushes forward a bony process that interlocks with the premaxilla . 
 The pharyngeal jaws of teleosts , a second set of jaws contained within the throat , are composed of five branchial arches , loops of bone which support the gills . The first three arches include a single basibranchial surrounded by two <unk> , ceratobranchials , <unk> and pharyngobranchials . The median basibranchial is covered by a <unk> . The fourth arch is composed of pairs of ceratobranchials and <unk> , and sometimes additionally , some pharyngobranchials and a basibranchial . The base of the lower pharyngeal jaws is formed by the fifth ceratobranchials while the second , third and fourth pharyngobranchials create the base of the upper . In the more basal teleosts the pharyngeal jaws consist of well @-@ separated thin parts that attach to the neurocranium , pectoral girdle , and hyoid bar . Their function is limited to merely transporting food and they rely mostly on lower pharyngeal jaw activity . In more derived teleosts , the jaws are more powerful with left and right ceratobranchials fusing to become one lower jaw ; the pharyngobranchials fuse to create a large upper jaw that articulates with the neurocranium . They have also developed a muscle that allows the pharyngeal jaws to have a role in grinding food in addition to transporting it . 
 The caudal fin is <unk> , meaning the upper and lower lobes are about equal in size . The spine ends at the caudal peduncle , the base of the caudal fin , distinguishing this group from those in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the caudal fin , such as most fish from the Paleozoic ( 541 to 252 million years ago ) . The neural arches are elongated to form <unk> which provide support for this upper lobe . In addition , the hypurals , bones that form a flattened plate at the posterior end of the vertebral column , are enlarged providing further support for the caudal fin . In general , teleosts tend to be quicker and more flexible than more basal bony fishes . Their skeletal structure has evolved towards greater lightness . While teleost bones are well calcified , they are constructed from a scaffolding of struts , rather than the dense cancellous bones of <unk> fish . In addition , the lower jaw of the teleost is reduced to just three bones ; the dentary , the angular bone and the articular bone .

 = = = External relationships = = = 
 The teleosts were first recognised as a distinct group by the German ichthyologist Johannes Peter Müller in 1844 . The name is from Greek <unk> , " complete " + osteon , " bone " . Müller based this classification on certain soft tissue characteristics which would prove to be problematic as it did not take into account the distinguishing features of fossil teleosts . In 1966 , Greenwood et al. provided a more solid classification . The oldest teleost fossils date back to the late Triassic , evolving from fish related to the bowfins in the clade Holostei . During the Mesozoic and Cenozoic they diversified , and as a result , 96 percent of all known fish species are teleosts . The cladogram shows the relationship of the teleosts to other bony fish , and to the terrestrial vertebrates ( tetrapods ) that evolved from a related group of fish . Approximate dates are from Near et al . , 2012 . 
 = = = Internal relationships = = = 
 The phylogeny of the teleosts has been subject to long debate , without consensus on either their phylogeny or the timing of the emergence of the major groups before the application of modern DNA @-@ based cladistic analysis . Near et al . ( 2012 ) explored the phylogeny and divergence times of every major lineage , analysing the DNA sequences of 9 unlinked genes in 232 species . They obtained well @-@ resolved phylogenies with strong support for the nodes ( so , the pattern of branching shown is likely to be correct ) . They calibrated ( set actual values for ) branching times in this tree from 36 reliable measurements of absolute time from the fossil record . The teleosts are divided into the major clades shown on the cladogram , with dates , following Near et al . 
 = = = Evolutionary trends = = = 
 Several early groups , now extinct , branched off from neopterygian ancestors before the teleosts appeared . These include the <unk> and <unk> of the Mesozoic era . These fish had elongated bodies ; some were filter @-@ feeders , while others ate larger prey . 
 The most basal of the living teleosts are the <unk> ( eels and allies ) and the <unk> ( <unk> and allies ) . There are 800 species of <unk> . They have thin leaf @-@ shaped larvae known as <unk> , specialised for a marine environment . Among the <unk> , eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw . The 200 species of <unk> are defined by a bony element in the tongue . This element has a basibranchial behind it and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the <unk> in the roof of the mouth . The clade <unk> includes the <unk> ( herrings ) and Ostariophysi ( carps , catfishes and allies ) . <unk> consist of 350 living species of herring and herring @-@ like fishes . This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals . In most species , the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing . Ostariophysi , which includes most freshwater fishes , have developed some unique adaptations . One is the Weberian apparatus , an arrangement of bones ( Weberian ossicles ) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear . This enhances their hearing , as sound waves make the bladder vibrate , and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear . They also have a chemical alarm system ; when a fish is injured , the warning substance gets in the water , alarming nearby fish . 
 The majority of teleost species belong to the clade <unk> ; which consists of 17 @,@ 419 species classified in <unk> genera and 346 families . Shared traits of the euteleosts include ; similarities in the embryonic development of the bony or cartilaginous structures located between the head and dorsal fin ( supraneural bones ) , an outgrowth on the <unk> bone ( a bone located near the neural arches of the tail ) and caudal median cartilages located between hypurals of the caudal base . The two major groups of euteleosts are <unk> , which consists of fish like salmon , pike and smelts and <unk> which contain the majority of euteleosts . A derived trait of <unk> is a muscle that controls the pharyngeal jaws , giving them a role in grinding food . Within <unk> , the <unk> have a spiny dorsal fin which is in front of the soft @-@ rayed dorsal fin . This fin helps provide thrust in locomotion and may also play a role in defense . <unk> have developed spiny ctenoid scales ( as opposed to the cycloid scales of other groups ) , tooth @-@ bearing premaxilla and greater adaptations to high speed swimming . 
 The adipose fin , which is present in over 6 @,@ 000 teleost species , is often thought to have evolved once in the lineage and to have been lost multiple times due to its limited function . However , a 2014 study challenges this idea and suggests that the adipose fin is an example of convergent evolution . In <unk> , the adipose fin develops from an outgrowth after the reduction of the larval fin fold , while in <unk> , the fin appears to be a remnant of the fold . 
 = = = Diversity = = = 
 There are over 26 @,@ 000 species of teleosts , in about 40 orders and 448 families . These fish are found in almost every aquatic environment and have developed specializations to feed in a variety of ways as carnivores , herbivores , filter feeders and parasites . The longest teleost is the giant oarfish , reported at 25 ft ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) and more , but this is dwarfed by the extinct <unk> , one individual of which has been estimated to have a length of 91 ft ( 27 @.@ 6 m ) . The heaviest teleost is believed to be the ocean sunfish , with a specimen landed in 2003 having an estimated weight of 2 @.@ 3 long tons ( 2 @.@ 3 metric tons ) , while the smallest fully mature adult is the male anglerfish <unk> <unk> which can measure just 0 @.@ 24 in ( 6 @.@ 2 mm ) , though the female at 2 in ( 50 mm ) is much larger . The stout <unk> is the smallest and lightest adult fish and is in fact the smallest vertebrate in the world ; the females measures 0 @.@ 33 in ( 8 @.@ 4 mm ) and the male just 0 @.@ 28 in ( 7 mm ) . 
 Open water fish are usually streamlined like torpedoes to minimize turbulence as they move through the water . Reef fish live in a complex , relatively confined underwater landscape and for them , manoeuvrability is more important than speed and many of them have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction . Many have laterally compressed bodies ( flattened from side to side ) allowing them to fit into fissures and swim through narrow gaps ; some use their pectoral fins for locomotion and others undulate their dorsal and anal fins . Some fish have grown dermal ( skin ) appendages for camouflage ; the prickly leather @-@ jacket is almost invisible among the seaweed it resembles and the tasselled scorpionfish invisibly lurks on the seabed ready to ambush prey . Some like the <unk> <unk> have eyespots to startle or deceive , while others such as lionfish have aposematic coloration to warn that they are toxic or have venomous spines . 
 <unk> are demersal fish ( bottom @-@ feeding fish ) that show a greater degree of asymmetry than any other vertebrates . The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development , with one eye migrating to the other side of the head , and they simultaneously start swimming on their side . This has the advantage that , when they lie on the seabed , both eyes are on top , giving them a broad field of view . The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage , while the underside is pale . 
 Some teleosts are parasites . <unk> have their front dorsal fins modified into large suckers with which they cling onto a host animal such as a whale , sea turtle , shark or ray , but this is probably a commensal rather than parasitic arrangement because both remora and host benefit from the removal of ectoparasites and loose flakes of skin . More harmful are the catfish that enter the gill chambers of fish and feed on their blood and tissues . The snubnosed eel , though usually a scavenger , sometimes bores into the flesh of a fish , and has been found inside the heart of a shortfin mako shark . 
 Some species , such as electric eels , can produce powerful electric currents , strong enough to stun prey . Other fish , such as <unk> , generate weak varying electric fields to detect their prey ; they swim with straight backs to avoid distorting their electric fields . These currents are produced by modified muscle or nerve cells . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Teleosts are found world @-@ wide and in most aquatic environments , including warm and cold seas , flowing and still freshwater , even , in the case of the desert pupfish , isolated and sometimes hot and saline bodies of water in deserts . Teleost diversity becomes low at extremely high latitudes ; at Franz Josef Land , up to 82 ° N , ice cover and water temperatures below 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) for a large part of the year limit the number of species ; 75 percent of the species found there are endemic to the Arctic . 
 Of the major groups of teleosts , the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ( perches , tunas and many others ) all have a worldwide distribution and are mainly marine ; the Ostariophysi and <unk> are worldwide but mainly freshwater , the latter mainly in the tropics ; the <unk> ( guppies , etc . ) have a worldwide distribution , both fresh and salt , but are surface @-@ dwellers . In contrast , the <unk> ( pikes ) are limited to freshwater in the Northern Hemisphere , while the <unk> ( salmon , trout ) are found in both Northern and Southern temperate zones in freshwater , some species migrating to and from the sea . The <unk> ( <unk> , etc . ) are Northern hemisphere fish , with both salt and freshwater species . 
 Some teleosts are migratory ; certain fresh water species move within river systems on an annual basis ; other species are anadromous , spending their lives at sea and moving inland to spawn , salmon and striped bass being examples . Others , exemplified by the eel , are <unk> , doing the reverse . The fresh water European eel migrates across the Atlantic Ocean as an adult to breed in floating seaweed in the Sargasso Sea . The adults spawn here and then die , but the developing young are swept by the Gulf Stream towards Europe . By the time they arrive , they are small fish and enter estuaries and ascend rivers , overcoming obstacles in their path to reach the streams and ponds where they spend their adult lives . 
 Teleosts including the brown trout and the scaly <unk> are found in mountain lakes in Kashmir at altitudes as high as 12 @,@ 530 ft ( 3 @,@ 819 m ) . Teleosts are found at extreme depths in the oceans ; the hadal <unk> has been seen at a depth of 25 @,@ 300 ft ( 7 @,@ 700 m ) , and a related ( unnamed ) species has been seen at 26 @,@ 720 ft ( 8 @,@ 145 m ) . 
 = = Physiology = = 
 = = = Respiration = = = 
 The major means of respiration in teleosts , as in most other fish , is the transfer of gases over the surface of the gills as water is drawn in through the mouth and pumped out through the gills . Apart from the swim bladder , which contains a small amount of air , the body does not have oxygen reserves , and respiration needs to be continuous over the fish 's life . Some teleosts exploit habitats where the oxygen availability is low , such as stagnant water or wet mud ; they have developed accessory tissues and organs to support gas exchange in these habitats . 
 Several genera of teleosts have independently developed air @-@ breathing capabilities , and some have become amphibious . Some combtooth blennies emerge to feed on land , and freshwater eels are able to absorb oxygen through damp skin . Mudskippers can remain out of water for considerable periods , exchanging gases through skin and mucous membranes in the mouth and pharynx . Swamp eels have similar well @-@ vascularised mouth @-@ linings , and can remain out of water for days and go into a resting state ( aestivation ) in mud . The <unk> have developed an accessory breathing structure known as the labyrinth organ on the first gill arch and this is used for respiration in air , and <unk> catfish have a similar <unk> organ . Certain other catfish , such as the Loricariidae , are able to respire through air held in their digestive tracts . 
 = = = Sensory systems = = = 
 Teleosts possess highly developed sensory organs . Nearly all daylight fish have colour vision at least as good as a normal human 's . Many fish also have chemoreceptors responsible for acute senses of taste and smell . Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system , which detects gentle currents and vibrations , and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey . Fish sense sounds in a variety of ways , using the lateral line , the swim bladder , and in some species the Weberian apparatus . Fish orient themselves using landmarks , and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols . Experiments with mazes show that fish possess the spatial memory needed to make such a mental map . 
 = = = Osmoregulation = = = 
 The skin of a teleost is largely impermeable to water and the main interface between the fish 's body and its surroundings is the gills . In freshwater , teleost fish gain water across their gills by osmosis while in seawater , they lose it . Similarly , salts diffuse outwards across the gills in freshwater and inwards in salt water . The European flounder spends most of its life in the sea but often migrates into estuaries and rivers . In the sea it can gain in an hour , Na + ions equivalent to forty percent of its total free sodium content , with 75 percent of this entering through the gills and the remainder through drinking . By contrast , in rivers there is an exchange of just two percent of the body Na + content per hour . As well as being able to selectively limit salt and water exchanged by diffusion , there is an active mechanism across the gills for the elimination of salt in sea water and its uptake in fresh water . 
 = = = Thermoregulation = = = 
 Fish are cold @-@ blooded and in general , their body temperature is the same as that of their surroundings . They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration and are able to regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood flow to the gills . Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills , with blood being diverted away from the gills during exposure to cold . Because of their relative inability to control their blood temperature , most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures . 
 Tuna and other fast @-@ swimming ocean @-@ going fish maintain their muscles at higher temperatures than their environment for efficient locomotion . Tuna achieve muscle temperatures 19 ° F ( − 7 ° C ) or even higher above the surroundings by having a counterflow system in which the metabolic heat produced by the muscles and present in the venous blood , pre @-@ warms the arterial blood before it reaches the muscles . Other adaptations of tuna for speed include a streamlined , spindle @-@ shaped body , fins designed to reduce drag , and muscles with a raised myoglobin content , which gives these a reddish colour and makes for a more efficient use of oxygen . In polar regions and in the deep ocean , where the temperature is a few degrees above freezing point , some large fish , such as the swordfish , marlin and tuna , have a heating mechanism which raises the temperature of the brain and eye , giving them significantly better vision than their cold @-@ blooded prey . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The body of a teleost is denser than water , so fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink . Many teleosts have a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases to allow them to stay at the current water depth , or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming . In the more primitive groups like some minnows , the swim bladder is open to the esophagus and doubles as a lung . It is often absent in fast swimming fishes such as the tuna and mackerel . In fish where the swim bladder is closed , the gas content is controlled through the rete mirabilis , a network of blood vessels serving as a countercurrent gas exchanger between the swim bladder and the blood . The Chondrostei such as sturgeons also have a swim bladder , but this appears to have evolved separately : other Actinopterygii such as the bowfin and the <unk> do not have one , so swim bladders appear to have arisen twice , and the teleost swim bladder is not homologous with the chondrostean one . 
 = = = Locomotion = = = 
 A typical teleost fish has a streamlined body for rapid swimming , and locomotion is generally provided by a lateral undulation of the hindmost part of the trunk and the tail , propelling the fish through the water . There are many exceptions to this method of locomotion , especially where speed is not the main objective ; among rocks and on coral reefs , slow swimming with great manoeuvrability may be a desirable attribute . Eels <unk> by wiggling their entire bodies . Living among seagrasses and algae , the seahorse adopts an upright posture and moves by fluttering its pectoral fins , and the closely related <unk> moves by rippling its elongated dorsal fin . <unk> " hop " along the substrate , propping themselves up and propelling themselves with their pectoral fins . Mudskippers move in much the same way on terrestrial ground . In some species , a pelvic sucker allows them to climb , and the Hawaiian freshwater goby climbs waterfalls while migrating . <unk> have three pairs of free rays on their pectoral fins which have a sensory function but on which they can walk along the substrate . Flying fish launch themselves into the air and can glide on their enlarged pectoral fins for hundreds of metres . 
 = = Reproduction and lifecycle = = 
 Most teleost species are oviparous , having external fertilisation with both eggs and sperm being released into the water for fertilisation . Internal fertilisation occurs in 500 to 600 species of teleosts but is more typical for Chondrichthyes and many tetrapods . This involves the male inseminating the female with an intromittent organ . Fewer than one in a million of externally fertilised eggs survives to develop into a mature fish , but there is a much better chance of survival among the offspring of members of about a dozen families which are viviparous . In these , the eggs are fertilised internally and retained in the female during development . Some of these species , like the live @-@ bearing aquarium fish in the <unk> family , are ovoviviparous ; each egg has a yolk sac which nourishes the developing embryo , and when this is exhausted , the egg hatches and the larva is expelled into the water column . Other species , like the <unk> in the family <unk> , are fully viviparous , with the developing embryo nurtured from the maternal blood supply via a placenta @-@ like structure that develops in the uterus . <unk> is practised by a few species , such as Nomorhamphus ebrardtii ; the mother lays unfertilised eggs on which the developing larvae feed in the uterus , and intrauterine cannibalism has been reported in some halfbeaks . 
 There are two major reproductive strategies of teleosts ; <unk> and <unk> . In the former , an individual breeds once after reaching maturity and then dies . This is because the physiological changes that come with reproduction eventually lead to death . Salmon of the genus Oncorhynchus are well known for this feature ; they hatch in fresh water and then migrate to the sea for up to four years before travelling back to their place of birth where they spawn and die . <unk> is also known to occur in some eels and smelts . The majority of teleost species , however , have <unk> , where mature individuals can breed multiple times during their lives . 
 = = = Sex identity and determination = = = 
 88 percent of teleost species are gonochoristic , having individuals that remain either male or female throughout their adult lives . The sex of an individual can be determined genetically as in birds and mammals , or environmentally as in reptiles . In some teleosts , both genetics and the environment play a role in determining sex . For species whose sex is determined by genetics , it can come in three forms . In <unk> sex determination , a single @-@ locus determines sex inheritance . Both the XY sex @-@ determination system and ZW sex @-@ determination system exist in teleost species . Some species , such as the southern <unk> , have both systems and a male can be determined by XY or ZZ depending on the population . 
 Multifactorial sex determination occurs in numerous Neotropical species and involves both XY and ZW systems . Multifactorial systems involve rearrangements of sex chromosomes and autosomes . For example , the darter <unk> has a ZW multifactorial system where the female is determined by <unk> and the male by ZZ . The wolf fish has a XY multifactorial system where females are determined by <unk> and the male by <unk> . Some teleosts , such as zebrafish , have a <unk> system , where there are several genes which play a role in determining sex . Environment @-@ dependent sex determination has been documented in at least 70 species of teleost . Temperature is the main factor , but PH levels , growth rate , density and social environment may also play a role . For the Atlantic <unk> , spawning in colder waters creates more females , while warmer waters create more males . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 Some teleost species are hermaphroditic , which can come in two forms : simultaneous and sequential . In the former , both spermatozoa and eggs are present in the gonads . Simultaneous hermaphroditism typically occurs in species that live in the ocean depths , where potential mates are sparsely dispersed . Self @-@ fertilisation is rare and has only been recorded in two species , <unk> marmoratus and <unk> <unk> . With sequential hermaphroditism , individuals may function as one sex early in their adult life and switch later in life . Species with this condition include parrotfish , wrasses , sea basses , flatheads , sea breams and <unk> . 
 <unk> is when an individual starts out male and becomes female while the reverse condition is known as <unk> , the latter being more common . Changing sex can occur in various contexts . In the bluestreak cleaner wrasse , where males have harems of up to ten females , if the male is removed the largest and most dominant female develops male @-@ like behaviour and eventually testes . If she is removed , the next ranking female takes her place . In the species <unk> <unk> , where individuals gather into large groups and females greatly outnumber males , if a certain number of males are removed from a group , the same number of females change sex and replace them . In clownfish , individuals live in groups and only the two largest in a group breed : the largest female and the largest male . If the female dies , the male switches sexes and the next largest male takes his place . 
 In deep @-@ sea anglerfish ( sub @-@ order <unk> ) , the much smaller male becomes permanently attached to the female and degenerates into a sperm @-@ producing attachment . The female and their attached male become a " semi @-@ hermaphroditic unit " . 
 = = = Mating tactics = = = 
 There are several different mating systems among teleosts . Some species are promiscuous , where both males and females breed with multiple partners and there are no obvious mate choices . This has been recorded in Baltic herring , guppies , Nassau groupers , humbug damselfish , cichlids and creole wrasses . Polygamy , where one sex has multiple partners can come in many forms . <unk> consists of one adult female breeding with multiple males , which only breed with that female . This is rare among teleosts , and fish in general , but is found in the clownfish . In addition , it may also exist to an extent among anglerfish , where some females have more than one male attached to them . Polygyny , where one male breeds with multiple females , is much more common . This is recorded in sculpins , sunfish , darters , damselfish and cichlids where multiple females may visit a territorial male that guards and takes care of eggs and young . Polygyny may also involve a male guarding a harem of several females . This occurs in coral reef species , such as damselfishes , wrasses , <unk> , <unk> , triggerfishes and <unk> . 
 Lek breeding , where males congregate to display to females , has been recorded in at least one species <unk> <unk> . Lek @-@ like breeding systems have also been recorded in several other species . In monogamous species , males and females may form pair bonds and breed exclusively with their partners . This occurs in North American freshwater catfishes , many <unk> , sea horses and several other species . Courtship in teleosts plays a role in species recognition , strengthening pair bonds , spawning site position and gamete release synchronisation . This includes colour changes , sound production and visual displays ( fin erection , rapid swimming , breaching ) , which is often done by the male . Courtship may be done by a female to overcome a territorial male that would otherwise drive her away . 
 Sexual dimorphism exists in some species . Individuals of one sex , usually males develop secondary sexual characteristics that increase their chances of reproductive success . In dolphinfish , males have larger and blunter heads than females . In several minnow species , males develop swollen heads and small bumps known as breeding tubercles during the breeding season . The male green <unk> parrotfish has a more well @-@ developed forehead with an " ossified ridge " which plays a role in ritualised headbutting . Dimorphism can also take the form of differences in coloration . Again , it is usually the males that are brightly coloured ; in <unk> , <unk> and wrasses the colours are permanent while in species like minnows , sticklebacks , darters and sunfishes , the colour changes with seasons . Such coloration can be very conspicuous to predators , showing that the drive to reproduce can be stronger than that to avoid predation . 
 Males that have been unable to court a female successfully may try to achieve reproductive success in other ways . In sunfish species , like the bluegill , larger , older males known as parental males , which have successfully courted a female , construct nests for the eggs they fertilise . Smaller satellite males mimic female behaviour and coloration to access a nest and fertilise the eggs . Other males , known as sneaker males , lurk nearby and then quickly dash to the nest , fertilising on the run . These males are smaller than satellite males . Sneaker males also exist in Oncorhynchus salmon , where small males that were unable to establish a position near a female dash in while the large dominant male is spawning with the female . 
 = = = Spawning sites and parental care = = = 
 Teleosts may spawn in the water column or , more commonly , on the substrate . Water column spawners are mostly limited to coral reefs ; the fish will rush towards the surface and release their gametes . This appears to protect the eggs from some predators and allow them to disperse widely via currents . However , they receive no parental care . Water column spawners are more likely than substrate spawners to spawn in groups . Substrate spawning commonly occurs in nests , rock crevices or even burrows . Some eggs can stick to various surfaces like rocks , plants , wood or shells . 
 Of the oviparous teleosts , most ( 79 percent ) do not provide parental care . Male care is far more common than female care . Male territoriality " <unk> " a species to evolve male parental care . One unusual example of female parental care is in mother discuses , which provide nutrients for their developing young in the form of mucus . Some teleost species have their eggs or young attached to or carried in their bodies . For sea catfishes , cardinalfishes , <unk> and some others , the egg may be incubated or carried in the mouth , a practice known as mouthbrooding . In some African cichlids , the eggs may be fertilised there . In species like the banded <unk> , young are brooded after they hatch and this may be done by both parents . The timing of the release of young varies between species ; some <unk> release new @-@ hatched young while other may keep then until they are juveniles . In addition to mouthbrooding , some teleost have also developed structures to carry young . Male <unk> have a bony hook on their foreheads to carry fertilised eggs ; they remain on the hook until they hatch . For seahorses , the male has a brooding pouch where the female deposits the fertilised eggs and they remain there until they become free @-@ swimming juveniles . Female banjo catfishes have structures on their belly to which the eggs attach . 
 In some parenting species , young from a previous spawning batch may stay with their parents and help care for the new young . This is known to occur in around 19 species of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika . These helpers take part in cleaning and fanning eggs and larvae , cleaning the breeding hole and protecting the territory . They have reduced growth rate but gain protection from predators . Brood parasitism also exists among teleosts ; minnows may spawn in sunfish nests as well as nests of other minnow species . The cuckoo catfish is known for laying eggs on the substrate as mouthbrooding <unk> collect theirs and the young catfish will eat the cichlid larvae . Filial cannibalism occurs in some teleost families and may have evolved to combat starvation . 
 = = = Growth and development = = = 
 Teleosts have four major life stages : the egg , the larva , the juvenile and the adult . Species may begin life in a pelagic environment or a demersal environment ( near the seabed ) . Most marine teleosts have pelagic eggs , which are light , transparent and buoyant with thin envelopes . Pelagic eggs rely on the ocean currents to disperse and receive no parental care . When they hatch , the larvae are planktonic and unable to swim . They have a yolk sac attached to them which provides nutrients . Most freshwater species produce demersal eggs which are thick , pigmented , relatively heavy and able to stick to substrates . Parental care is much more common among freshwater fish . Unlike their pelagic counterparts , demersal larvae are able to swim and feed as soon as they hatch . Larval teleosts often look very different from adults , particularly in marine species . Some larvae were even considered different species from the adults . Larvae have high mortality rates , most die from starvation or predation within their first week . As they grow , survival rates increase and there is greater physiological tolerance and sensitivity , ecological and behavioural competence . 
 At the juvenile stage , a teleost looks more like its adult form . At this stage , its axial skeleton , internal organs , scales , pigmentation and fins are fully developed . The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple , lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish , while in other species , like salmon , <unk> , gobies and flatfishes , the transition is more complex and takes several weeks to complete . At the adult stage , a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction . Like many fish , teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives . Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass living up to 25 years . Rockfish appear to be the longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years . 
 = = Shoaling and schooling = = 
 Many teleosts form shoals , which serve multiple purposes in different species . Schooling is sometimes an antipredator adaptation , offering improved vigilance against predators . It is often more efficient to gather food by working as a group , and individual fish optimise their strategies by choosing to join or leave a shoal . When a predator has been noticed , prey fish respond defensively , resulting in collective shoal behaviours such as synchronised movements . Responses do not consist only of attempting to hide or flee ; antipredator tactics include for example scattering and reassembling . Fish also aggregate in shoals to spawn . 
 = = Relationship with humans = = 
 = = = Economic importance = = = 
 Teleosts are economically important in different ways . They are captured for food around the world . A small number of species such as herring , cod , pollock , anchovy , tuna and mackerel provide people with millions of tons of food per year , while many other species are fished in smaller amounts . They provide a large proportion of the fish caught for sport . Commercial and recreational fishing together provide millions of people with employment . 
 A small number of productive species including carp , salmon , tilapia and catfish are farmed commercially , producing millions of tons of protein @-@ rich food per year . The FAO expects production to increase sharply so that by 2030 , perhaps sixty @-@ two percent of food fish will be farmed . 
 Fish are consumed fresh , or may be preserved by traditional methods , which include combinations of drying , smoking , and salting , or fermentation . Modern methods of preservation include freezing , freeze drying , and heat processing ( as in canning ) . Frozen fish products include breaded or battered fillets , fish fingers and <unk> . Fish meal is used as a food supplement for farmed fish and for livestock . Fish oils are made either from fish liver , especially rich in vitamins A and D , or from the bodies of oily fish such as sardine and herring , and used as food supplements and to treat vitamin deficiencies . 
 Some smaller and more colourful species serve as aquarium specimens and pets . Sea wolves are used in the leather industry . Isinglass is made from thread fish and drum fish . 
 = = = Impact on stocks = = = 
 Human activities have affected stocks of many species of teleost , through overfishing , pollution and global warming . Among many recorded instances , overfishing caused the complete collapse of the Atlantic cod population off Newfoundland in 1992 , leading to Canada 's indefinite closure of the fishery . Such commercial extinction does not however signify extinction of the species . Pollution , especially in rivers and along coasts , has harmed teleosts as sewage , pesticides and herbicides have entered the water . Many pollutants , such as heavy metals , organochlorines , and <unk> interfere with teleost reproduction , often by disrupting their endocrine systems . In the roach , river pollution has caused the intersex condition , in which an individual 's gonads contain both cells that can make male gametes ( such as spermatogonia ) and cells that can make female gametes ( such as <unk> ) . Since endocrine disruption also affects humans , teleosts are used to indicate the presence of such chemicals in water . Water pollution caused local extinction of teleost populations in many northern European lakes in the second half of the twentieth century . 
 The effects of climate change on teleosts could be powerful but are complex . For example , increased winter precipitation ( rain and snow ) could harm populations of freshwater fish in Norway , whereas warmer summers could increase growth of adult fish . In the oceans , teleosts may be able to cope with warming , as it is simply an extension of natural variation in climate . It is uncertain how ocean acidification , caused by rising carbon dioxide levels , might affect teleosts .

 A few teleosts are dangerous . Some like the electric eel and the electric catfish can give a severe electric shock .

 Medaka and zebrafish are used as research models for studies in genetics and developmental biology .

 Teleost fishes have been frequent subjects in art , reflecting their economic importance , for at least 14 @,@ 000 years . They were commonly worked into patterns in Ancient Egypt , acquiring mythological significance in Ancient Greece and Rome , and from there into Christianity as a religious symbol ; artists in China and Japan similarly use fish images symbolically . Teleosts became common in Renaissance art , with still life paintings reaching a peak of popularity in the Netherlands in the 17th century . In the 20th century , different artists such as Klee , Magritte , Matisse and Picasso used representations of teleosts to express radically different themes , from attractive to violent . The zoologist and artist Ernst Haeckel painted teleosts and other animals in his 1904 <unk> der Natur . Haeckel had become convinced by Goethe and Alexander von Humboldt that making accurate depictions of unfamiliar natural forms , such as from the deep oceans , he could not only discover " the laws of their origin and evolution but also to press into the secret parts of their beauty by sketching and painting " . 
 = Imperial Bedrooms = 
 Imperial Bedrooms is a novel by American author Bret Easton Ellis . Released on June 15 , 2010 , it is the sequel to Less Than Zero , Ellis ' 1985 bestselling literary debut , which was shortly followed by a film adaptation in 1987 . Imperial Bedrooms revisits Less Than Zero 's self @-@ destructive and disillusioned youths as they approach middle @-@ age in the present day . Like Ellis ' earlier novel , which took its name from Elvis Costello 's 1977 song of the same name , Imperial Bedrooms is named after Costello 's 1982 album . 
 The action of the novel takes place twenty @-@ five years after Less Than Zero . Its story follows Clay , a New York @-@ based screenwriter , after he returns to Los Angeles to cast his new film . There he becomes embroiled in the sinister world of his former friends and confronts the darker aspects of his own personality . The novel opens with a literary device which suggests the possibility that the narrator of Imperial Bedrooms may not be the same as the narrator of Less Than Zero although both are ostensibly narrated by Clay . In doing this , Ellis is able to comment on the earlier novel 's style and on the development of its moralistic film adaptation . In the novel Ellis explores Clay 's pathological narcissism , masochistic and sadistic tendencies , and exploitative personality , which had been less explicit in Less Than Zero . Ellis chose to do this in part to dispel the sentimental reputation Less Than Zero has accrued over the years , that of " an artifact of the 1980s " . Imperial Bedrooms retains Ellis ' characteristic transgressive style and applies it to the 2000s ( decade ) and 2010s , covering amongst other things , the impact of new communication technologies on daily lives . 
 Ellis began working on what would become Imperial Bedrooms during the development of his 2005 novel , Lunar Park . As with his previous works , Imperial Bedrooms depicts scenes of sex , extreme violence and hedonism in a minimalist style devoid of emotion . Some commentators have noted however that unlike previous works , Imperial Bedrooms employs more of the conventional devices of popular fiction . Reviews were mixed and frequently polarized . Some reviewers felt the novel was a successful return to themes explored in Less Than Zero , Lunar Park and American Psycho ( 1991 ) , while others derided it as " boring " or self @-@ indulgent . 
 = = Background = = 
 The development of Imperial Bedrooms began after Ellis re @-@ read Less Than Zero as part of the writing process for his 2005 novel , Lunar Park . The novel takes its name from Elvis Costello 's 1982 album Imperial Bedroom , just as Less Than Zero had been named for a Costello single . After reading his first novel , Ellis began to reflect on what had become of the characters from Less Than Zero . Soon , he found himself " overwhelm [ ed ] " by the idea of what would become Imperial Bedrooms as it continually returned to him . After gestating the idea , and making " voluminous notes " , his detailed outline became longer than the finished book . Ellis felt that this process of note @-@ taking limited him to the novels that he genuinely wanted " to stay with for a couple of years " . To this , he attributed having " written so few novels " . Ellis 's biggest influence in the course of writing Imperial Bedrooms was American novelist Raymond Chandler , " and that kind of pulpy noir fiction " . He found inspiration in Chandler because " He didn 't even know how some of his books ended . That 's part of what makes those books existentialist masterpieces . " To Ellis , " It 's about a journey and a tone and style and this worldview he created . " In terms of his own plotting , however , he opined that " plots really don 't matter " , nor solutions to mysteries , because it 's " the mood that 's so enthralling ... [ a ] kind of universal , this idea of a man searching for something or moving through this moral landscape and trying to protect himself from it , and yet he 's still forced to investigate it . " Part of the " impetus " behind Imperial Bedrooms , which Ellis " wrestled with " , was to try and dispel the " sentimental view of Less Than Zero " that made it , to some , " an artifact of the 80s " alongside " John Hughes movies and Ray @-@ Bans and Fast Times at Ridgemont High " ; he felt he began assessing audience 's reactions to his work when working on Lunar Park . 
 On April 14 , 2009 , MTV News announced that Ellis had nearly finished the novel and it would be published in May 2010 . At the time , Ellis revealed that all the novel 's main characters would return . Prior to publication , Ellis had been convinced by his persuasive editor to remove some of the more graphic lines from Imperial Bedrooms ' torture scenes , which he later regretted . " My most extreme act of self @-@ censoring in Imperial Bedrooms , " he said , however , was to omit a three @-@ line description of a silver wall , because he felt that Clay would never have written it . Ellis stated he had no plans to make changes to the book as it stands in a second edition . Months prior to the book 's release , Ellis tweeted the first sentence of the novel , " They had made a movie about us . " The Random House website later announced the on sale date of June 22 , 2010 in both hardback and paperback . With it , they released a picture of the book 's cover and a short synopsis , which described the book as focusing on a middle @-@ aged Clay , now a screenwriter , drawn back into his old circle . Amidst this , Clay begins dating a young actress with mysterious ties to Julian , Rip and a recently murdered Hollywood producer ; his life begins to spin out of control . In Imperial Bedrooms , Los Angeles returns once again as the book 's setting . Along with New York , where Clay has been prior to coming home , it is one of Ellis ' two major locations . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The action of Imperial Bedrooms depicts Clay upon returning to Los Angeles , having lived in New York for four years , in order to assist in the casting of his new film . There he meets up with his old friends who were characters in Less Than Zero . Like Clay , they have all become involved in the film industry : his philandering friend Trent Burroughs — who has married Blair — is a manager , while Clay 's former classmate at Camden , Daniel Carter , has become a famous producer . Julian Wells , who was a male prostitute in Less Than Zero , has become an ultra @-@ discreet high @-@ class pimp representing struggling young actors who do not wish to tarnish future careers . Rip Millar , Clay 's former drug dealer , now controls his own cartel and has become disfigured through repeated plastic surgeries . 
 Clay attempts to romance Rain Turner , a gorgeous young woman auditioning for a role in his new film , leading her on with the promise of being cast , all the while knowing she is too old for the part . His narration reveals he has done this with a number of men and women in the past , and yet often comes out of the relationship hurt and damaged himself . Over the course of their relationship , he is stalked by unknown persons driving a Jeep and is frequently reminded by various individuals of the grisly murder of a young producer whom he knew . Clay <unk> watches a snuff film of the murder — later attributed to Rip — on his iPhone . 
 As the novel progresses , Clay learns that Rip also had a fling with Rain and is now obsessed with her . When Clay discovers that Julian is currently Rain 's boyfriend , he conspires with Rip to hand Julian over to him . When Julian is then found murdered , Rain confronts Clay about his role in the affair and is raped by him in response . He later receives a video of Julian 's murder from Rip which has been overdubbed with an angry voicemail from Clay as a means to implicate him in the crime . The novel then depicts sequences of the savage sexual and physical abuse of a beautiful young girl and young boy , perpetrated by Clay . Clay experiences no feelings of remorse or guilt for this , for Julian 's death , or for exploiting and raping Rain . In the last scenes , it is strongly implied that Blair has been hiring people to follow Clay . In return for his giving her what she wants , she offers to provide Clay with a false alibi that will prevent the police from arresting him as an accomplice to Julian 's murder . 
 = = Characters = = 
 Much critical attention has been given to the development of the characters from the original book , 25 years on . One review opined that " [ Ellis ' ] characters are incapable of growth . They cannot credibly find Jesus or even see a skilled psychologist or take the right medication to fend off despair . They are bound to be American psychos . " Their development , some critics have observed , illuminates the ways they have not developed as people ; Clay is , for example , " in mind and spirit if not quite in body , destined to remain unchanged , undeveloped , unlikable and unloved . " In Less Than Zero , though the characters of the novel compose for some " the most hollow and vapid representation of the MTV generation one could possibly imagine " , they remained to other reviewers " particularly sympathetic " . Like the novel , its characters were equally cultural milestones , described by a reviewer as " seminal characters " ( of American fiction ) . On the subject of the 1987 film , Clay describes that " the parents who ran the studio would [ n 't ] ever expose their children in the same black light the book did " . To Bill <unk> , this shows how " the children have become the parents , writing scripts and producing movies , still imprisoned by Hollywood 's youth and drug cultures – but now looking at things from the outside in . " <unk> comments for the New York Press , that while " they 're in careers now and new relationships and different states of mind ... their preoccupations are just the same . " 
 Clay , the protagonist of Less Than Zero , " once a paralyzed observer , is now a more active character and has grown to be a narcissist " . Clay 's narcissism emerges , according to Ellis , because Ellis as a writer " wasn 't that interested in the other characters , and neither is Clay . " For the author , his became " an exploration of intense narcissism . " In 2010 , Clay is now a " successful screenwriter " with the " occasional producer credit " . He returns to LA to help cast The Listeners ( reminiscent of Ellis ' involvement with the 2009 film adaptation of his short story collection The Informers ) . Now 45 , and no longer a disaffected teen , Clay is described by Details as " arguably worse than American Psycho 's Patrick Bateman " ; Ellis says that he " wouldn 't disagree " with this because Bateman 's crimes are ambiguous . In terms of Clay 's psychology , Ellis notes his preponderance for a " masochistic cycle of control and rejection and seduction and inevitable pain " , which " is something he gets off on because he 's ... a masochist and not a romantic . " The Los Angeles Times notes how Clay " shares biographical details with Ellis " , a successful party @-@ boy , who in 1985 was " often conflated with his fictional counterpart . " Ellis asserts to the contrary , " I 'm not really Clay . " As opposed to his portrayal in Less Than Zero , Imperial Bedrooms makes it more abundantly clear that Clay is as manipulative as those around him ; he is , in Ellis ' words , " guilty " . As in Less Than Zero , Clay has " stuck to thinking and feeling as little as possible " , " fending off the enemy of emotion with regular doses of alcohol and sedatives such as <unk> , living with a kind of psychic " locked @-@ in " syndrome . " As in Zero and Psycho , the novel also poses the question of Clay 's reality , The Independent asking " Is Clay really being followed or is he being dogged by a guilty conscience for crimes committed , even when they are crimes of inaction ? " Over the novel , " Clay shifts from damaged to depraved " ; a " final scene in Imperial Bedrooms of unremitting torture ... enacted by Clay on two beautiful teenagers who are bought and systematically abused " demonstrates " Clay 's graduation from a passively colluding observer to active perpetrator ... who either indulges in torture or fantasizes about it . " 
 The novel is written in the first @-@ person , from Clay 's perspective . Clay , who " felt betrayed by Less Than Zero " , uses Imperial Bedrooms to make a stand or a case for himself , though ultimately " reveals himself to be far worse than the author of Less Than Zero ever began to hint at . " Clay still bears similarities to the earlier character in Less Than Zero ; according to one reviewer , " not all that much is changed . Clay is a cipher , an empty shell who is only able to approximate interactions and experiences through acts of sadism and exploitation . " He is also , in many ways , a new character , because the opening of the book presents that the Clay of Less Than Zero had merely been " just a writer pretending to be him " . When asked why he " changed " Clay from " passive " to " guilty " , Ellis explained he felt Clay 's inaction in the original novel made him equally as guilty ; it had " always bothered " Ellis that Clay didn 't do anything to save the little girl being raped in the first novel . The Independent notes " his passivity [ in Less Than Zero ] has hardened into something far more culpable , and nefarious . " According to Ellis , " In LA , over time , the real person you are ultimately comes out . " He also speculates " maybe the fear turned him into a monster " . Ellis remarks that he finds the developments in Clay " so exciting " . One reviewer summarized the character 's development , " The nascent narcissist of Less Than Zero ... is now left in a " dead end " . The novel is Ellis ' " deeply pessimistic presentation of human nature as <unk> ... an unflinching study of evil . " 
 Blair and Trent Burroughs share a loveless marriage . Blair remains , according to Janelle Brown , " the moral center of Ellis ' work " , and Trent has become a Hollywood manager . The Oregonian notes " Although Blair and Trent have children , the children are never described and hardly mentioned ; their absence is " even more unsettling than the absence of parents in a story about teenagers , underlining the endlessly narcissistic nature of the characters ' world . " Julian Wells has gone on to establish a very exclusive escort service of his own in Hollywood . While in Less Than Zero , Clay felt protective of Julian , who had fallen into prostitution and drug addiction , in the new novel , he attempts to have him killed . The " grisly " dispatch of Julian late in the book , and Clay 's casual mention of it early on , were part of a " rhythm " that Ellis felt suited the book . He speculates whether " the artist looking back " becomes a destructive force . He hadn 't planned to kill off the character , just finding that while writing " it felt right " . Rip Millar occupies both terrifying and comic relief roles in the novel . Vice describes him , hyperbolically , as " like the supervillain of these two books " . Uncertainties about the character 's " specifics " originate in Clay , who " doesn 't really want to know , which makes it kind of scarier " . 
 = = Writing style = = 
 Writing for The Observer , Alison Kelly of the University of Oxford observes the novel 's " philosophical " qualities , and opines that its " thriller @-@ style hints and foreshadowings ... form part of a metaphysical investigation . " Kelly describes it as " existentialist to the extent that it confronts the minimal limits of identity " and an exposé of the worst depths of human nature . She further argues that the novel 's motif of facial recognitions amounts to the message that people should be read " at face value " , and that furthermore , past action is the greatest indicator of future behaviour , leaving no room for " change , growth , [ or ] self @-@ reinvention " . In terms of stylistic literary changes , Ellis also displays more fondness for the <unk> pathetic fallacy than in previous works . For the most part , the novel is written in Ellis ' trademark writing style ; Lawson refers to this as " sexual and narcotic <unk> in an emotionless tone . " With regard to this style , Ellis cites precursors to himself , particular the work of filmmakers . Ellis feels that the technique itself gives the reader a unique kind of insight into the characters , and comments that " numbness is a feeling too . <unk> isn 't the only feeling there is . " In terms of style , Ellis told Vice that he enjoyed his return to minimalism , because of the challenge of " [ t ] <unk> to achieve that kind of tension with so few words was enjoyable to do . " While some reviewers of popular fiction derided Ellis 's style as " flat " , others found it unexpectedly moving . 
 = = Literary devices and themes = = 
 Imperial Bedrooms opens with an acknowledgement of the Less Than Zero novel and film both as actual items within the fictional history of Imperial Bedrooms ' Clay ; he describes " The movie was based on a book by someone we knew … . It was labeled fiction but only a few details had been altered and our names weren 't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn 't happened . " The Los Angeles Times describes this as a " nifty little trick " , because it allows Ellis to establish the newer book " as the primary narrative , one that trumps Ellis as author and the real world . " The San Francisco Chronicle calls it a " neat trick of authorial self @-@ abnegation " . Another reviewer describes it as Ellis at " his most ambitious " , a " Philip <unk> , doppelgänger gambit " , making his new narrator " the real Clay " and the other an imposter . This allows Ellis to skilfully , " with writerly jujitsu " , acknowledge Robert Downey Jr . ' s popular performance as Julian in the moralistic 1987 film , in which he died ; Ellis appreciates the adaptation as a " milestone in a lot of ways " . The device also allows the novelist to insert self @-@ critique ; The Sunday Times reviewer notes that Imperial Bedrooms finds its characters " still a little sore at their depiction as inarticulate zombies " . John Crace , in his " digested read " of Imperial Bedrooms , insinuates through parody that " the author " of the metafictional Less Than Zero is also meant to be Ellis , describing him in Clay 's voice as " too immersed in the passivity of writing and too pleased with his own style to bother with many commas to admit it so he wrote me into the story as the man who was too frightened to love . " With regard to the opening narrative conceit , Ellis queries " Is it complication ... or is it clarification ? " , opining that it certainly is the latter for Clay . Though Ellis never names himself in the book , he concedes to Lawson that although " I don 't name the author " , one can " guess [ Bret Easton Ellis ] is who the Clay of Imperial Bedrooms is referring to . " Ellis told Vice that he hadn 't explicitly considered when writing the novel whether Clay was referring to him or not . Eileen Battersby comments , " Just as he did in Lunar Park ( 2005 ) , Ellis uses self @-@ consciousness as a device . " According to Vice , this conceit of self @-@ consciousness means that " Imperial Bedrooms is no mere sequel . It 's more a culmination of all of Ellis 's work " , containing " the scatological violence of American Psycho " and " the otherworldly terror of Lunar Park " . Ellis himself raises the " sequel " question , commenting " ... I don 't think it is [ a sequel ] . Well , I mean , it is and it isn 't . It 's narrated by him , sure . But I guess I could maybe have switched the names around and it could stand alone . " 
 Asked about the motif and " casual approach to " bisexual characters in his novels , continued in Imperial Bedrooms , Ellis stated he " really [ didn 't ] know " , and that he wished he could provide " an answer – depicting [ him ] as extremely conscious of those choices " . He believes it to be an " interesting aspect of [ his ] work " . Details notes how Ellis ' own sexuality , frequently described as bisexual , has been notoriously hard to pin down . Reviewers have long tried to probe Ellis on autobiographical themes in his work . He reiterates to Vice that he is not Clay . Ellis says that other contemporary authors ( naming Michael Chabon , Jonathan Franzen , Jonathan Lethem as examples ) don 't get asked if their novels are autobiographical . ( However , Ellis tells one interview , that he " cannot fully " say that " I 'm not Clay " because of their emotional " connections " . ) Vice attributes this streak to Ellis ' age when Less Than Zero came out , which led to him being seen as a voice @-@ of @-@ the @-@ generation . Ellis feels that the autobiographical truths of his novels lie in their writing processes , which to him are like emotional " exorcisms " . Crace 's abovementioned parody suggests that Less Than Zero Clay was originally a flattering portrayal of Ellis . Ellis discusses lightly the kinds of self @-@ insertion present in the book . While Clay is clearly ( parodically ) working on the film adaptation of The Informers , he is at the same time fully aware that he has been a character in Less Than Zero , and that ostensibly , Ellis is ' the author ' whom Clay knew . However , there are clear differences to the characters , as well . For example , Ellis had to omit lines from the book he felt Clay would never have thought of , on subjects he would never have noticed . Ellis himself feels he is adapting to middle @-@ age very well ; Clay , however , isn 't . 
 Imperial Bedrooms also breaches several new territories . When compared to Less Than Zero , its " huge shift " is a technological one . The novel picks up on many aspects of the early 21st century culture , such as Internet viral videos which depict executions . The novel reflects how technology changes the nature of interpersonal relationships . Additionally , Clay is text @-@ stalked throughout the book ; Ellis himself had been " text @-@ stalked " before in real life . Ellis feels this was an unconscious exploration of the dynamics brought on by the new technology . The author also predicts that " fans of Less Than Zero " may " feel betrayed " ; Imperial Bedrooms ' thrust is its " narrative ... of exploitation " . One reviewer describes the novel 's " central theme " as " Hollywood is an industry town running on exploitation " , and criticizes this theme for being unoriginal in 2010 . An Irish Times review notes positively however that Ellis ' " vision of society is bleak ; his dark studies of the human animal as shocking as ever . " The new setting poses questions , such as " Is Hollywood intended as a variation of ancient Rome ? Is the movie industry a coliseum ? " Another review found that the celebrity setting , as visited before in his novel Glamorama ( 1998 ) , allows Ellis to make a number of observations about contemporary pop culture via Clay , such as when he asserts " that exposure can ensure fame " . Ellis comments how in Less Than Zero , Clay 's passivity worked to protect him from the " bleak moral landscape he was a part of " , which he views as Clay 's major flaw . Ellis developed this into the more unabashedly ' guilty ' Clay of the new novel . Ellis says that " a portrait of narcissism was the big nut that I had . Of entitlement . This imperial idea . " The difference he notes between this " portrait of a narcissist " and his earlier ones , such as American Psycho and Lunar Park , come in the form of its more moral bent : " This time " , Ellis comments , " the narcissist reaches a dead end . " To one reviewer , Clay 's world at its most exaggerated , in the scenes of torture , reach <unk> heights of dystopian fantasy , comparing Imperial Bedrooms to Brave New World ( 1932 ) , " where the " command economy " now manifests as rampant , late @-@ capitalist consumerism , where <unk> is the new soma and humans are zombies : one character 's face is " unnaturally smooth , redone in such a way that the eyes are shocked open with perpetual surprise ; it 's a face mimicking a face , and it looks agonized . "

 The Guardian attempted to aggregate what they found to be polarised reviews of Imperial Bedrooms , noting that one Times reviewer felt the novel was simply dull , " impoverished " , and " ghastly " , whereas the London Review of Books felt that in spite of its flaws , the book was enjoyable for its " beautiful one @-@ liners " and the fun of " seeing the old Easton Ellis magic applied to the popular culture of our era ... iPhones , Apple stores , internet videos and Lost . " The New Statesman compiled reviews from The Independent , The Observer , and The New York Times . The first two reviews are positive , praising Ellis ' " modern noir " , the book 's " atmosphere " , and indebtedness to Philip Roth and F. Scott Fitzgerald , with the Observer saying it " ranks with his best in the latter register [ of Fitzgerald ] . " The latter review accused Ellis of falling flat , attracting negative comparison to Martin Amis ; both have " a flair for such perfect , surreal description " but " struggle to set it in an effective context . " Other writers attempting to gauge the book 's reception also describe it as " mixed " . The Periscope Press deemed that the novel 's reviews were mostly negative , citing Dr. Alison Kelly 's article for The Guardian as the only counter @-@ example , while deeming that it " still read more like restrained criticism than outright praise " . On the subject of reviews , British critic Mark Lawson notes the tendency for Ellis ' reviews to be " unpredictable " ; he cited the irony of favour amongst right @-@ wing critics , and the extent to which the liberal media attack his work . Ellis himself , however , states that he " proudly " accepts the label of moralist . He also attributes some of the negative criticism that Imperial Bedrooms and Ellis ' earlier works have received in the past to the earlier schools of feminist criticism ; today , he observes young girls " reading the works correctly " , opining the books shouldn 't be read through the lens of " old school feminism . " To that end , the author observes that older women reviewing Imperial Bedrooms in the US had issues with it , not least feelings of betrayal . He feels these are ironic because the book is in fact a critique of a certain kind of male perspective and behaviour . 
 Tom Shone , writing for The Sunday Times , praised the novel for its atypical qualities for Ellis , " known for his orgies of violence " . Shone asks " Why is a new sequel to Less Than Zero ... so moving ? " , noting the presence of " feelings " in the novel to be starkly different from Ellis ' usual style . Touching on its personal qualities , Shone notes " If Lunar Park <unk> the atrocities of American Psycho back to their source , Imperial Bedrooms pulls the thread further and reaches Less Than Zero " . The emotive energy in the new book is traced back to the last pages of Lunar Park as well ; fellow writer Jay McInerney observes that " The last few pages of [ Lunar Park ] are among the most moving passages I know in recent American fiction [ because ] ... Bret was coming to terms with his relationship with his father in that book . " Vice observes that the " final passages in both Imperial Bedrooms and Lunar Park pack a lot of emotional impact . " San Francisco Chronicle hails Imperial Bedrooms as " the very definition of <unk> meta : Ellis is either so deeply enmeshed in his own creepy little insular world that he can 't write his way out of it , or else he is such a genius that he 's created an entire parallel universe that folds and unfolds on itself like some kind of Escher print . " 
 Regarding the book 's achievement , Shone remarks " He now stands at year zero – creatively , psychologically . " However , typical features of Ellis ' earlier works remain intact ; for example , in its depictions of violence . Commenting on its self @-@ referential aspects , Janelle Brown of the San Francisco Chronicle recommends " for his next endeavor , Ellis should stop worrying and start looking for the exit of his own personal rabbit hole . " The Buffalo News awarded the novel its Editor 's Choice . Jeff Simon comments that it " brings an excessive <unk> flavor to Obama America " . With regards to the novel 's writing style , he comments " The first @-@ person sentences run on and on , but the individual sections of the book are nothing if not minimal ... ghastly narcissism or not , Bret Easton Ellis has a fictional territory all his own and , heaven forbid , a mastery there . " The Wall Street Journal on the other hand , described this prose style as " flat and <unk> " . Such is the book 's violent aesthetic that , for Eileen Battersby of The Irish Times , " the book is closer to his remarkable third novel , American Psycho " . She further compliments Ellis as " a bizarrely moral writer who specializes in evoking the amoral . " Concerning his writing , she notes its " despair is blunt , factual and seldom approaches the laconic unease of JG Ballard . " 
 Following her positive comments , however , Battersby concludes negatively . The book is a " bleak performance ... a tired study of the vacuous " with the feeling of an improvised screenplay being performed by an uncommitted cast . She sums that Ellis ' novel " consists of too many doors being left slightly ajar , and not enough rooms , or opportunities , being fully explored . " Some critics have questioned the book 's relevance to a contemporary audience . Dallas News poses the question , whether Imperial Bedrooms is " a story anyone is interested in anymore " , because Ellis ' " blunt , spare , journal @-@ entry prose " is no longer , in 2010 , " the backstage pass " it once was to the lives of " LA 's rich and famous " . Furthermore , Tom <unk> argues that since the 1980s , that decade has become a " go @-@ to bargain bin for retro @-@ trends and ready @-@ made nostalgia , easy to package into fashion lines and TV shows " . The review bemoans that the novel 's theme , the dark side of Hollywood , is no longer a culture @-@ shocking revelation , and that Ellis fails to capitalize on the narratorial conceit which it opens with . <unk> does highlight positive aspects , however . Ellis wisely " appropriates the unblinking brutality [ of ] ... American Psycho , to add some dramatic heft to this anorexic update " , making the sequel a " celebrity snuff film " to the earlier " backstage pass " . The Wall Street Journal damned the novel as " a dull , stricken , under @-@ medicated <unk> that goes nowhere . " The Boston Globe reviewer opined that " Ellis is aiming for noir , for the territory of James Ellroy and Raymond Chandler , but ends up with an XXX @-@ rated episode of Melrose Place . " 
 Andrew McCarthy , who played Clay in the 1987 Less Than Zero film , described the novel as " an exciting , shocking conclusion ... a surprising one . " The actor praised Clay 's character , citing a " wicked vulnerability " which the character covers up with alcohol , hostility , and its portrayal of a world " full of pain and suffering and unkindness " beneath the " glossy and shimmering and seductive " veneer of Hollywood . McCarthy described his experience of reading the book as like " revisiting an old friend " , owing to the consistency of the characters ' and Ellis ' voices .

 In May 2010 , when MTV News first announced that Ellis had finished writing Imperial Bedrooms , the writer told them in interview that he had begun looking ahead to the possibility of a film adaptation , and felt that interpreting it as a sequel to the 1987 movie adaptation starring Andrew McCarthy , Robert Downey Jr . , James Spader and Jami Gertz " would be a great idea " . Two months prior to the book 's release , Less Than Zero actor Andrew McCarthy stated it was " early days " in thinking about a potential film adaptation ; McCarthy felt , however , that the novel would adapt well . Because the characters in Imperial Bedrooms have been owned by 20th Century Fox since Ellis sold the film rights to Less Than Zero , prospective film for Imperial Bedrooms rights revert to Fox . Ellis stated to Vice in June 2010 that he would be interested in writing the screenplay . In July 2010 however , the author clarified to California Chronicle , saying " There 's no deal , there 's no one attached . There 's been some vague talk among the cast members ... As far as I know right now nothing 's happening . " Ellis opines that were Robert Downey Jr. to get involved , the film would move straight into production . However , remembering the adaptation process Less Than Zero went through , he admits " I 've learned to be cautious about saying oh they 'll never turn this dark depraved character into any sort of interesting Mulholland Drive , David Lynch kind of movie , but I could be totally wrong about that . I don 't know . " 
 = Anthony Roll = 
 The Anthony Roll is a record of ships of the English Tudor navy of the 1540s , named after its creator , Anthony Anthony . It originally consisted of three rolls of vellum , depicting 58 naval vessels along with information on their size , crew , armament , and basic equipment . The rolls were presented to King Henry VIII in 1546 , and were kept in the royal library . In 1680 Charles II gave two of the rolls to Samuel Pepys , who had them cut up and bound as a single volume book , which is now in the Pepys Library at Magdalene College , Cambridge . The third roll remained in the royal collection until it was given by William IV to his daughter , Mary Fox , who sold it to the British Museum in 1858 ; it is now owned by the British Library . 
 The Anthony Roll is the only known fully illustrated inventory of ships of the English navy in the Tudor period . As the work of a successful state official in 16th century England , the artistic value of the Anthony Roll has been described as being characterised by " naive draughtsmanship and conformity to a pattern " though its artistic aspects display " a decent amateur grasp of form and colour " . While the inventories listed in its text have proven to be highly accurate , most of the ship illustrations are rudimentary and made according to a set formula . The level of detail of the ship design , armament and especially rigging has therefore proven to be only approximate . Nevertheless , through their depiction of the ceremonial ornamentation the illustrations in the Roll have provided relevant secondary information to the study of Tudor period heraldry , flags and ship ornamentation . 
 The only known contemporary depictions of prominent Tudor era vessels like the Henry Grace à Dieu and the Mary Rose are contained in the Anthony Roll . As the Mary Rose sank by accident in 1545 and was successfully salvaged in 1982 , comparison between the information in the Roll and the physical evidence of the Mary Rose has provided new insights into the study of the naval history of the period . 
 = = Author and artist = = 
 Anthony Anthony has been identified as the compiler of the information and the artist behind the illustrations through his signature , which has been compared with holograph letters among the State Papers . Anthony 's father was William Anthony ( died 1535 ) a Fleming from Middelburg in Zeeland who migrated to England in 1503 . William was a supplier of beer to the army , and Anthony followed in his father 's footsteps . He went into beer exporting no later than 1530 and became a supplier of beer to the navy . In 1533 Anthony was appointed gunner at the Tower of London , a position he retained nominally until his death . He rose to the rank of overseer of the Ordnance Office , the government body responsible for supplying the armed forces with artillery , and it was in this position that he compiled his Roll . In 1549 he was promoted to master surveyor of the ordnance in the Tower , Calais , Boulogne , and elsewhere for life . He continued the work of supplying arms to English forces , and was active in the last month of his life supplying guns for an expedition against Le Havre . 
 In 1939 Dutch historian Nicholas <unk> proposed that the Flemish artist and cartographer Cornelis <unk> ( or <unk> . , c . 1507 – 1553 ) could have been Anthony Anthony 's brother . Although <unk> ' suggestion of kinship was conjectural and without any direct evidence , it was picked up by Geoffrey Callender in the Mariner 's Mirror in 1963 and has been relayed by several other authors . The will of William Anthony did not mention any other sons and <unk> is believed to have been the son of Antonis <unk> , the daughter of Jacob <unk> van <unk> . That Cornelis and Anthony were related is , in the words of Ann Payne , " not , presumably , impossible , but there is little evidence that they were connected at all " . 
 = = History of the manuscript = = 
 The " ship portrait " had a long history in maritime art , from medieval seals and coins to early engravings in the 15th century , and the plain side @-@ on view of a ship under sail , often with no crew shown , was well established as the most effective way of recording the build of vessels . The Anthony Roll belongs to a genre of works that was intended to serve a dual role for the king and the military leadership : as reasonably informative overviews listing details of ships or strategic areas of coastlines they could be studied to determine strengths and weaknesses , and as boastful and lively depictions of Tudor military might they could be used to flatter the king , impress courtiers and impose martial authority on foreign ambassadors . Contemporary maps , or " plats " , were routinely decorated with detailed pictures of ships , to mark bodies of water as much as to liven up the scenes . Such maps were common at the time , and were even embellished by artists if deemed too simple or drab . The navy was expanded during King Henry 's reign , and he was known to take an interest in warships , as can be seen by the epic painting Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover which portrayed , if rather unrealistically , the ships that took the 29 @-@ year @-@ old king to the summit meeting with Francis I at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520 . This painting , recently dated to around 1545 , has also been suggested as a likely source of inspiration to Anthony for his illustrations . 
 There are three such plats depicting naval actions and expeditions that are attributed to Anthony : the route of Anne of Cleves from the Low Countries to England ( 1539 ) , a French attack on a coastal fort ( date unknown ) and a French raid on Brighton ( July 1545 ) . The design of the ships in these paintings , especially that of the Brighton raid , closely match those in the rolls . It is not known exactly when work on the rolls began nor when it was finished . It is only certain that it was presented to the king the year it was dated , 1546 . The inclusion of the Mary Rose that sank at the Battle of the Solent 19 July 1545 does not mean it was necessarily started before this date , since it was still considered possible that she could be raised even as late as 1549 . The galleasses , the Antelope , Hart , Bull and Tiger , all present in the second roll , were still being built around March 1546 , and the Hart was not at sea until October that year . At the same time the Galley Blanchard , captured from the French 18 May 1546 is not included . 
 After the rolls were presented to the king they were archived in the royal collections . In 1680 Charles II gave two of the rolls to Samuel Pepys , a navy administrator and avid book collector . Pepys did not disclose the details of how the rolls were given to him , but it is believed that the gift came out of a meeting with King Charles where Pepys took down the king 's account of how he escaped from the Battle of Worcester ( 1651 ) . The plan was that Pepys would edit and publish the already famous story , but he never did so . It is also known that Pepys was planning to write a history of the navy and that he was gathering material for this task , but this project also was never finished . It is considered likely that King Charles was aware of Pepys ' plans and presented him with two of the rolls either as a gift or as payment for the intended publication of the escape story . The second roll could not be located at that time , and it was not until 1690 that it was discovered by Henry Thynne , keeper of the royal library 1677 – 89 and a close friend of Pepys . Thynne arranged for Pepys to make copies of some of the illustrations , but by 1690 Charles was dead and James II was in exile . Pepys had resigned from his position as Secretary of the Admiralty that same year and refused to recognize the reign of William and Mary , which meant that acquisition of the final roll for his collection was out of the question . The creation of the codex from the first and third rolls is therefore assumed to have been completed shortly after that time . After Pepys ' death in 1703 his library passed on to his nephew John Jackson . After the death of Jackson in 1724 the library , along with the codex , was then passed on to Pepys ' old college at Magdalene , Cambridge , where it remains to this day . 
 The second roll was presumed lost by the 1780s , but actually remained in the hands of the royal family . William IV gave it to Mary <unk> , one of his illegitimate children by the courtesan Dorothea Jordan , sometime in the early 19th century . In 1824 , <unk> married Charles Robert Fox , a major @-@ general and from 1832 – 35 an officer of the surveyor of the ordnance , the same position Anthony Anthony had three centuries before him . Fox was a bibliophile , and historian Charles Knighton has suggested he knew the value of the roll , but its location nevertheless remained unknown to scholars . In 1857 Frederic Madden , keeper of manuscripts at the British Museum , was shown the second roll and learned that Mary Fox wished to sell it . After negotiations it was sold for £ 15 to the British Museum and was numbered Additional MS <unk> . It was kept in its original format as a roll and has been stored in the British Library 's manuscript collection at St Pancras since 1999 . 
 The Anthony Roll has been used frequently as a primary source for histories of the English navy of the 16th century but the full text and all illustrations were not collected in one volume until 2000 . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Anthony Roll was originally a set of three separate vellum rolls . It exists today in the form of a bound volume containing the first and third rolls while the second roll is preserved in its original form . The three original rolls were made up out of a total of 17 individual membranes glued to the back of the next membrane . The membranes were of a width of 70 cm ( 27 ½ inches ) and a height varying from 79 to 96 cm ( 31 to 37 ¾ inches ) . After receiving the first and third rolls Pepys had his clerks cut the rolls up and bound in a single volume as a book , now known as Pepys <unk> . The transformation of the two rolls created a horizontal page structure , and some of the ornamentation that was cut in process was copied into the volume by hand . Pepys also inserted abstracts between the two rolls and a summarizing table that was not Anthony 's , but pre @-@ dated Pepys ' binding of the rolls . This radical treatment of the original document has damaged some of the illustrations and is today deprecated . The first three illustrations of the Henry Grace à Dieu , Mary Rose and Peter Pomegranate were all too large to fit on one page and were therefore converted to two @-@ page spreads . The resulting bend down the centre of the illustrations led to noticeable loss of detail . Despite this , there are no plans to attempt a recreation of the original structure of the first and third rolls . The second roll , British Library Additional MS <unk> , is still in its original condition with the exception of a written endorsement by Mary Fox from 1857 and some damage caused by an application of chemicals to reveal faded writing . 
 The three rolls list 58 ships divided into classes based roughly on size and construction . Each ship is presented along with its name , tonnage , crew size and , in Anthony 's own words , " the <unk> , artillery , munitions and <unk> for <unk> " . The first roll lists the carracks and one pinnace , beginning with the largest ship Henry Grace à Dieu . The second roll lists galleasses , a hybrid of oar @-@ powered and sailing vessels , and one galley . Finally , the third roll is reserved for pinnaces and " rowbarges " , both basically smaller versions of galleasses . 
 = = Artistic analysis = = 
 Anthony Anthony was not a trained , professional artist . The illustrations are described as " striking and boldly executed , but [ ... ] have few claims to be fine works of art " . The vessels are for the most part painted according to a standard formula , with distinct repetitions even in the more elaborate depictions . Anthony 's style is signified by a " naive draughtsmanship and conformity to a pattern [ ... ] consistent with the abilities of a government official with a decent amateur grasp of form and colour " . 
 The rolls were all of roughly the same length , about 5 @.@ 5 m ( 15 ft ) , and would most likely have been presented side by side for display on a table or hung on a wall . The focal point of the whole composition is in the second , middle roll where the exceptionally well @-@ executed painting of the Galley Subtle is placed . That this ship was intended to be the centrepiece illustration is made clear by the presence of the pinnace Mary James in the first roll , which is otherwise reserved for ( sailing ) ships . This appears to have originally been placed at the beginning of the third roll , among the other pinnaces and rowbarges , but was moved to achieve more equal lengths . In his pursuit of living up to the image of a Renaissance prince Henry is known to have been particularly fond of galleys , something which would have been known to Anthony . 
 The lettering , framing lines and floral pattern decorations are painted in red or black with the exception of the first three ships of the first roll , which also feature gold . Most of the illustrations were first sketched with plummet outlines and were then painted over in washes . Ship timbers are a light brown that are shaded in the bow and stern to achieve depth , decorations and anchors are highlighted with red , and green is used for guns . <unk> are in black and the sea is in shades varying from " greyish green " to " a richer blue " . 
 The first two rolls were done with roughly the same amount of detail while the lesser rowbarges ( essentially small galleys ) were done more hastily . The first two ships of the first roll , the Henry Grace à Dieu and the Mary Rose , have traces of a grid pattern , indicating that they were transferred from a different drawing while the rest are done in freehand . Overall , the ships follow a formula depending on the type of ship . The exceptions are stern galleries of some of the galleasses and the figureheads of the Mary Rose , Salamander and the Unicorn , the latter both captured from the Scots in 1544 . The prominent exception is the Galley Subtle placed in the middle of the second roll . It is more consistent in type with Mediterranean @-@ type galleys than the galleasses and small rowbarges , and features a considerable amount of detail not present in the other ships . It is the only ship where any crew is visible , in this case rowers behind <unk> as protection from enemy arrows and an overseer wearing " a bonnet , full skirted armorial doublet and baggy breeches " holding a stick or baton , as if beating the time of the strokes of the rowers . 
 = = Use as an historical source = = 
 As an historical record , the Anthony Roll is in many ways unique . It is the only known fully illustrated list of a Tudor period royal navy , though the pictures should not be seen as exact depictions drawn from real life . For example , the lists of guns of the individual ships , which are considered to be an accurate record produced by a senior state official , are only approximately matched to the paintings . The rigging is only roughly accurate , and has been described by Margaret Rule , archaeological project leader of the Mary Rose excavations , as " a confusing assemblage of shrouds , ratlines and stays " . Many details are present , but others are missing , such as the chain @-@ <unk> ( the horizontal platforms extending from the sides ) to which the shrouds ( the parallel ropes that stabilized the masts ) were attached to keep them clear of the hull . 
 = = = Comparisons with the Mary Rose = = = 
 Comparisons with the finds from the salvaged Mary Rose itself have provided an opportunity to compare the accuracy of the records provided in the Roll . The picture of the ship has provided clues about basic structural features , such as the number of masts and sails . When compared with an inventory of the ship from 1514 , there is a close match , proving the illustration to be largely accurate . Examination of details in the construction , however , reveals that Anthony allowed himself some artistic licence . The armament in the painted ship appears clearly exaggerated . The heavy stern chasers ( cannon placed in the stern aimed backwards ) mounted through gun ports on the orlop deck , just about the waterline , would not have been feasible because of the lack of an orlop deck and the steep angle ( sheer ) of the ship in this area . The number of gunports in the broadside is inaccurate since it implies two slightly staggered rows of nine ports while the surviving starboard side of the Mary Rose has only one row of gunports on the main deck with seven ports . The accuracy of the forecastle has been more difficult to ascertain since none of it remains ; conflicting interpretations of what it looked like have been suggested . 
 The guns in the back of the forecastle have defied explanation , but one theory is that they were included to compensate for the guns that were positioned in the <unk> , aiming forwards , but which would have been obscured due to the angle from which the ship was depicted . The list of ammunition , small firearms , longbows , arrows , pikes , and bills closely matches the archaeological evidence . As the source that is closest in time to the sinking of the Mary Rose , it has been of central importance for the archaeological project , especially in estimating the size of the crew . 
 = = = Flags and ornamentation = = = 
 The Anthony Roll provides detailed information about the flags used on the ships . According to the vexillologist Timothy Wilson , the flags depicted flying from the ships are " the most elaborate source we have for the flags flown on the ships of King Henry VIII , being richer in visual detail than all other sources put together . " Among the most striking flags in the illustrations are the elongated ceremonial streamers , shown flying from all ships in varying numbers . These feature a Saint George red cross on white ground on the hoist , nearest the flagpole , and a very long tail striped in green and white . They all feature gold paint on the red and green , and silver paint ( now oxidized to black ) on the white . This artistic device was used either to simulate the fluttering of the flags or to actually display the metallic thread and paint that was sometimes used to decorate them . 
 Along the railing of all ships , most prominently on the large carracks and the Galley Subtle , there are rows of banners displaying various heraldic designs , including the English royal arms , one or three fleur @-@ de @-@ lis of the French arms , Saint George 's crosses and Henry VIII 's monogram ( " HR " ) in gold on blue , what appears to be the Tudor rose , and the green and white of the House of Tudor . The depictions of the flags and banners on the ships are in a heraldic and military sense considered to be roughly accurate but not entirely consistent . A kind of system of command among the various vessels is apparent in how flags are displayed on the masts , but it does not appear to have been carried through systematically . Some of the heraldic designs have been described as " unlikely " by the 20th century herald George Bellew , but have deemed to at least be " plausible " by Wilson .

 When Mylan expanded internationally , Bresch noticed that Mylan 's US @-@ based pharmaceutical manufacturing plant had full @-@ time staff from the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) devoted to it , whereas facilities abroad had not been inspected by the FDA for more than a decade . Bresch persuaded several of Mylan 's competitors to support what became the Generic Drug User Fee Act , which she proposed to lawmakers in 2010 . Under the law the pharmaceutical industry would pay fees of $ 300 million in order to fund FDA inspections of foreign drug manufacturing facilities at the same rate as US @-@ based facilities . To advocate for the new law , she made regular visits to Washington , D.C. , and sponsored a whitepaper . The Generic Drug User Fee Act of 2012 was passed on July 9 , 2012 and required FDA inspections of pharmaceutical manufacturing locations abroad if they are importing into the US . 
 Bresch has also advocated for broader availability of <unk> in public places to treat anaphylaxis ( severe allergic reactions ) , and has been active in raising awareness of HIV / AIDS treatment in developing nations .

She was also the chair of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association ( <unk> ) for two terms . Bresch was appointed President of Mylan in 2009 and joined Mylan 's Board of Directors in March 2011 . 
 Bresch 's appointment as Chief Executive Officer was announced in 2001 and she officially took the position in January 2012 . Bresch was the first female CEO of a large pharmaceutical business . At the time , she was one of 18 female CEOs of a Fortune 500 company . She was ranked 31 in Fortune Magazine 's 2014 " 50 Most Powerful Women " list Bresch initially did not think her role as a female executive was significant . After seeing how few female candidates were available for positions that require a background in science and math , she became more interested in promoting math and science education among young girls . 
 As CEO of Mylan , Bresch continued advocating for more regulation of the pharmaceutical industry by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) . She was recognized in Esquire 's 2011 " Patriots of the Year " list for her work pushing for the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act ( <unk> ) .

 The Khewra Salt Mine ( or Mayo Salt Mine ) is located in Khewra , north of Pind Dadan Khan , an administrative subdivision of Jhelum District , Punjab Region , Pakistan , which rises from the Indo @-@ Gangetic Plain . It is Pakistan 's largest and oldest salt mine and the world 's second largest . It is a major tourist attraction , drawing up to 250 @,@ 000 visitors a year . Its history dates back to its discovery by Alexander 's troops in 320 BC , but it started trading in the Mughal era . The main tunnel at ground level was developed by Dr. H. Warth , a mining engineer , in 1872 during British rule . After independence , the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation took over the mine , which still remains the largest source of salt in the country , producing more than 350 @,@ 000 tons per annum of about 99 % pure halite . Estimates of the reserves of salt in the mine vary from 82 million tons to 600 million tons . 
 = = History = = 
 The Khewra Salt Mine is also known as Mayo Salt Mine , in honour of Lord Mayo , who visited it as Viceroy of India . The mine is a part of a salt range that originated about 800 million years ago , when evaporation of a shallow sea followed by geological movement formed a salt range that stretched for about 300 kilometers ( 185 miles ) . The salt reserves at Khewra were discovered when Alexander the Great crossed the Jhelum and <unk> region during his Indian campaign . The mine was discovered , however , not by Alexander , nor by his allies , but by his army 's horses , when they were found licking the stones . <unk> horses of his army also recovered after licking the rock salt stones . During the Mughal era the salt was traded in various markets , as far away as Central Asia . On the downfall of the Mughal empire , the mine was taken over by Sikhs . Hari Singh <unk> , the Sikh Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , shared the management of the Salt Range with Gulab Singh , the Raja of Jammu . The former controlled the <unk> mine , while the latter held Khewra . The salt quarried during Sikh rule was both eaten and used as a source of revenue . In 1872 , some time after they had taken over the Sikhs ' territory , the British developed the mine further . They found the mining to have been inefficient , with irregular and narrow tunnels and entrances that made the movement of labourers difficult and dangerous . The supply of water inside the mine was poor , and there was no storage facility for the mined salt . The only road to the mine was over difficult , rocky terrain . To address these problems the government levelled the road , built warehouses , provided a water supply , improved the entrances and tunnels , and introduced a better mechanism for excavation of salt . Penalties were introduced to control salt smuggling . While working with Geological Survey of India in the 1930s and 1940s , <unk> Sahni found evidence of angiosperms , gymnosperms and insects from the Cambrian period inside the mine .

 Khewra Salt Mine is situated in Pind Dadan Khan Tehsil of Jhelum District . Located about 200 km ( 125 miles ) from Islamabad and Lahore , it is accessed via the M2 motorway , about 30 kilometers ( 20 miles ) off the Lilla interchange while going towards Pind Dadan Khan on the Lilla road . The mine is in mountains that are part of a salt range , a mineral @-@ rich mountain system extending about 200 km from the Jhelum river south of <unk> Plateau to where the Jhelum river joins the Indus river . Khewra mine is about 288 meters ( 945 feet ) above sea level and about 730 meters ( 2400 feet ) into the mountain from the mine entrance . The underground mine covers an area of 110 km2 ( 43 sq. miles ) . 
 = = Production = = 
 Estimates of the total reserves of salt in the mines range from 82 million tons to 600 million tons . In raw form it contains negligible amounts of Calcium , Magnesium , Potassium , <unk> and moisture , with Iron , Zinc , Copper , Manganese , Chromium and Lead as trace elements . Salt from Khewra , also known as Himalayan salt , is red , pink , off @-@ white or transparent . In the early years of British rule , the Khewra mine produced about 28 @,@ 000 to 30 @,@ 000 tons per annum ; it increased to about 187 @,@ 400 tons per annum for the five fiscal years ending 1946 – 7 and to 136 @,@ 824 tons for the two years ending 1949 – 50 with the systematic working introduced by Dr H. Warth . The mine 's output was reported in 2003 to be 385 @,@ 000 tons of salt per annum , which amounts to almost half of Pakistan 's total production of rock salt . At that rate of output , the tunnel would be expected to last for another 350 years . 
 The mine comprises nineteen stories , of which eleven are below ground . From the entrance , the mine extends about 730 meters ( 2440 ft ) into the mountains , and the total length of its tunnels is about 40 km ( 25 miles ) . Quarrying is done using the room and pillar method , mining only half of the salt and leaving the remaining half to support what is above . The temperature inside the mine remains about 18 – 20 ° C throughout the year . A 2 ft ( 610 mm ) narrow gauge railway track laid during the British era is used to bring salt out of the mine in rail cars . 
 Himalayan salt is Pakistan 's best known rock salt . It is used for cooking , as bath salt , as brine and as a raw material for many industries , including a soda ash plant set up by <unk> in 1940 . Salt from Khewra mine is also used to make decorative items like lamps , vases , ashtrays and statues , which are exported to the United States , India and many European countries . The use of rock salt to make artistic and decorative items started during the Mughal era , when many craftsman made tableware and decorations from it . Warth introduced the use of a lathe to cut out art pieces from the rock salt , as he found it similar to gypsum in physical characteristics . 
 In 2008 the Government of Pakistan decided to sell off seventeen profitable organizations including Khewra salt mines , but the plan was shelved . The mine is now operated by the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation , a government department . 
 = = Tourism = = 
 Khewra Salt Mine is a major tourist attraction , with around 250 @,@ 000 visitors a year , earning it considerable revenue . Visitors are taken into the mine on a train . There are numerous pools of salty water inside . The Badshahi Mosque was built in the mining tunnels with multi @-@ colored salt bricks about fifty years ago . Other artistic carvings in the mine include a replica of Minar @-@ e @-@ Pakistan , a statue of Allama Iqbal , an accumulation of crystals that form the name of Muhammad in Urdu script , a model of the Great Wall of China and another of the Mall Road of Murree . In 2003 two phases of development of tourist facilities and attractions were carried out , at a total cost of 9 million rupees . A clinical ward with 20 beds was established in 2007 , costing 10 million rupees , for the treatment of asthma and other respiratory diseases using salt therapy . The " Visit Pakistan Year 2007 " event included a train safari visit of Khewra Salt Mine . In February 2011 Pakistan railways started operating special trains for tourists from Lahore and Rawalpindi to Khewra . For this purpose the railway station of Khewra was refurbished with the help of a private firm .

The water available to the residents of Khewra had been polluted by salt , coal and other nearby mining activity . This case is internationally recognised as important with regard to the relationship between humanity and the environment . 
 In 2003 , while the Government of Pakistan was looking for ways to increase the country 's strategic store of oil to 90 days , the <unk> put forward a proposal to use the Khewra mines to store strategic oil reserves . Scientific reports confirmed the feasibility of this proposal , but it was turned down .

 = Nagato @-@ class battleship = 
 The Nagato @-@ class battleships ( <unk> , Nagato @-@ gata senkan ) were a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) during World War I , although they were not completed until after the end of the war . Nagato , the lead ship of the class , frequently served as a flagship . Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923 . They were modernized in 1933 – 36 with improvements to their armor and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style . Nagato and her sister ship Mutsu briefly participated in the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War in 1937 and Nagato was the flagship of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 that began the Pacific War . 
 The sisters participated in the Battle of Midway in June 1942 , although they did not see any combat . Mutsu saw more active service than her sister because she was not a flagship and participated in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in August before returning to Japan in early 1943 . One of Mutsu 's aft magazines detonated in June , killing 1 @,@ 121 crew and visitors and destroying the ship . The IJN conducted a perfunctory investigation into the cause of her loss and concluded that it was the work of a disgruntled crewmember . They dispersed the survivors in an attempt to conceal the sinking to keep up morale in Japan . Much of the wreck was salvaged after the war and many artifacts and relics are on display in Japan . 
 Nagato spent most of the first two years of the war training in home waters . She was transferred to Truk in mid @-@ 1943 , but did not see any combat until the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid @-@ 1944 when she was attacked by American aircraft . Nagato did not fire her main armament against enemy vessels until the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944 . She was lightly damaged during the battle and returned to Japan the following month for repairs . The IJN was running out of fuel by this time and decided not to fully repair her . Nagato was converted into a floating anti @-@ aircraft platform and assigned to coastal defense duties . After the war , the ship was a target for U.S. nuclear weapon tests during Operation Crossroads in mid @-@ 1946 . She survived the first test with little damage , but was sunk by the second test . 
 = = Background = = 
 The IJN considered a battle fleet of eight modern battleships and eight modern armored cruisers necessary for the defense of Japan , and the government adopted that policy in 1907 . This was the genesis of the Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program , the development of a cohesive battle line of 16 capital ships less than eight years old . Advances in naval technology like the British battleship HMS Dreadnought and the battlecruiser HMS Invincible forced the IJN to several times re @-@ evaluate the ships that it counted as modern . By 1910 , the IJN considered none of its current ships to be modern and restarted the program in 1911 with orders for the Fusō @-@ class dreadnoughts and the Kongō @-@ class battlecruisers . By 1915 , the IJN was halfway to its goal and wanted to order four more dreadnoughts , but the Diet rejected its plan , and the 1916 budget authorized only one dreadnought , later named Nagato , and two battlecruisers . Later that year , American President Woodrow Wilson announced plans for 10 additional battleships and six battlecruisers , and the following year the Diet authorized three more dreadnoughts in response , one of which would later be named Mutsu . 
 = = Design = = 
 Allocated project number A @-@ 102 , the Nagato class was designed before Commander Yuzuru Hiraga was reassigned to the Navy Technical Department ( NTD ) responsible for ship design , although Hiraga is often credited with the design of these ships . In contrast to earlier designs , the Nagato class used the American " all or nothing " armor scheme that maximized the armor thickness protecting the core of the ship by eliminating armor elsewhere . The design had two armored decks of medium thickness rather than the single thicker deck used formerly . The ships also used a new type of underwater protection system that successfully resisted penetration by 200 @-@ kilogram ( 440 lb ) torpedo warheads in full @-@ scale trials . It consisted of a deep water @-@ tight compartment adjacent to the hull , backed by a thick torpedo bulkhead that connected to the side and deck armor plates , with a deep fuel oil tank behind it . 
 Although the United States Navy planned to arm its Colorado class with 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) guns before the Nagato class was designed , Nagato 's 410 @-@ millimeter ( 16 @.@ 1 in ) guns made her the first dreadnought that was launched armed with guns larger than 15 inches ( 381 mm ) . 
 On 12 June 1917 , well before Mutsu was laid down , Hiraga proposed a revised design for the ship that reflected the lessons from the Battle of Jutland that had occurred the previous year , and incorporated advances in boiler technology . Given project number A @-@ 125 , his design added an extra twin main @-@ gun turret , using space and weight made available by the reduction of the number of boilers from 21 to 12 , while the power remained the same . He reduced the secondary armament from 20 guns to 16 , although they were raised in height to improve their ability to fire during heavy weather and to improve their arcs of fire . To increase the ship 's protection he proposed angling the belt armor outwards to improve its resistance to horizontal fire , and increasing the thickness of the lower deck armor and the torpedo bulkhead . Hiraga also planned to add anti @-@ torpedo bulges to improve underwater protection . He estimated that his ship would displace as much as Nagato , although it would cost about a million yen more . Hiraga 's changes would have considerably delayed Mutsu 's completion and were rejected by the Navy Ministry . 
 = = Description = = 
 The ships had a length of 201 @.@ 17 meters ( 660 ft 0 in ) between perpendiculars and 215 @.@ 8 meters ( 708 ft 0 in ) overall . They had a beam of 29 @.@ 02 meters ( 95 ft 3 in ) and a draft of 9 @.@ 08 meters ( 29 ft 9 in ) . The Nagato @-@ class ships displaced 32 @,@ 720 metric tons ( 32 @,@ 200 long tons ) at standard load and 39 @,@ 116 metric tons ( 38 @,@ 498 long tons ) at full load . Their crew consisted of 1 @,@ 333 officers and enlisted men as built and 1 @,@ 368 in 1935 . In 1944 , the crew totaled around 1 @,@ 734 men . 
 The Nagato class was equipped with a unique <unk> ( seven @-@ legged ) mast designed to maximize rigidity for range @-@ finding purposes and survivability under shellfire . It consisted of a thick vertical leg in the center surrounded by six outer legs . The central leg was large enough to accommodate an electric elevator running between the foretop and main deck . In November 1944 , the tops of Nagato 's mainmast and funnel were removed to improve the arcs of fire for her anti @-@ aircraft guns . 
 In 1927 , Mutsu 's bow was remodeled to reduce the amount of spray produced when steaming into a head sea . This increased her overall length by 1 @.@ 59 meters ( 5 ft 3 in ) to 217 @.@ 39 meters ( 713 ft 3 in ) . This proved successful and her sister 's bow was rebuilt in 1930 . During their 1934 – 36 reconstruction , the ships ' sterns were lengthened by 7 @.@ 55 meters ( 24 @.@ 8 ft ) to improve their speed and their forward superstructures were rebuilt into a pagoda mast . They were given torpedo bulges to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armor and equipment . These changes increased their overall length to 224 @.@ 94 m ( 738 @.@ 0 ft ) , their beam to 34 @.@ 6 m ( 113 ft 6 in ) and their draft to 9 @.@ 49 meters ( 31 ft 2 in ) . Their displacement increased over 7 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 6 @,@ 900 long tons ) to 46 @,@ 690 metric tons ( 45 @,@ 950 long tons ) at deep load . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The ships were equipped with four Gihon geared steam turbines , each of which drove one 4 @.@ 191 @-@ meter ( 13 ft 9 in ) propeller . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 80 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 60 @,@ 000 kW ) , using steam provided by 21 Kampon water @-@ tube boilers ; 15 of these were oil @-@ fired while the remaining half @-@ dozen used fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate . The boilers had a working pressure of 286 psi ( 1 @,@ 972 kPa ; 20 kgf / cm2 ) . 
 The ships had a stowage capacity of 1 @,@ 600 long tons ( 1 @,@ 626 t ) of coal and 3 @,@ 400 long tons ( 3 @,@ 455 t ) of oil , giving them a range of 5 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 200 km ; 6 @,@ 300 mi ) at a speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . Nagato exceeded her designed speed of 26 @.@ 5 knots ( 49 @.@ 1 km / h ; 30 @.@ 5 mph ) during her sea trials , reaching 26 @.@ 7 knots ( 49 @.@ 4 km / h ; 30 @.@ 7 mph ) at 85 @,@ 500 shp ( 63 @,@ 800 kW ) and Mutsu reached the same speed with 87 @,@ 500 shp ( 65 @,@ 200 kW ) . The US Navy did not learn their actual speed capability until about 1937 ; previously it had believed that the ships were capable of only 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . 
 During refits in 1923 – 25 , the fore funnel was rebuilt in a serpentine shape in an unsuccessful effort to prevent smoke interference with the bridge and fire @-@ control systems . The rebuilt fore funnel was eliminated during the ships ' 1930s reconstructions when their boilers were replaced by 10 oil @-@ fired Kampon boilers , which had a working pressure of 313 psi ( 2 @,@ 158 kPa ; 22 kgf / cm2 ) and temperature of 300 ° C ( 572 ° F ) . The turbines were also replaced by lighter , more modern , units and their propellers were replaced by larger 4 @.@ 3 @-@ meter ( 14 ft 1 in ) ones . When the ships conducted their post @-@ reconstruction trials , they reached a speed of 24 @.@ 98 knots ( 46 @.@ 26 km / h ; 28 @.@ 75 mph ) with 82 @,@ 300 shp ( 61 @,@ 400 kW ) . Additional fuel oil was stored in the bottoms of the newly added torpedo bulges , which increased their capacity to 5 @,@ 560 long tons ( 5 @,@ 650 t ) and thus their range to 8 @,@ 560 nmi ( 15 @,@ 850 km ; 9 @,@ 850 mi ) at 16 knots . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The main armament of the Nagato @-@ class ships consisted of eight 45 @-@ caliber 41 @-@ centimeter guns , mounted in two pairs of twin @-@ gun , superfiring turrets fore and aft . Numbered one through four from front to rear , the hydraulically powered turrets gave the guns an elevation range of − 2 to + 35 degrees . The rate of fire for the guns was around two rounds per minute . Their turrets were replaced in the mid @-@ 1930s using the turrets stored from the unfinished Tosa @-@ class battleships . While in storage they were modified to increase their range of elevation to − 3 to + 43 degrees , which increased the gun 's maximum range from 30 @,@ 200 to 37 @,@ 900 meters ( 33 @,@ 000 to 41 @,@ 400 yd ) . 
 By World War II , the guns used Type 91 armor @-@ piercing , capped shells . Each of these shells weighed 1 @,@ 020 kilograms ( 2 @,@ 250 lb ) and had a muzzle velocity of 780 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ) . Also available was a 936 @-@ kilogram ( 2 @,@ 064 lb ) high @-@ explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of 805 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 640 ft / s ) . A special Type 3 Sankaidan incendiary shrapnel shell was developed in the 1930s for anti @-@ aircraft use . 
 The ships ' secondary armament of twenty 50 @-@ caliber 14 @-@ centimeter guns was mounted in casemates on the upper sides of the hull and in the superstructure . The latter guns had a maximum elevation of + 20 degrees and the former could elevate to + 25 degrees which gave them ranges of 15 @,@ 800 meters ( 17 @,@ 300 yd ) and 17 @,@ 000 meters ( 19 @,@ 000 yd ) respectively . Each gun could fire a 38 @-@ kilogram ( 84 lb ) high @-@ explosive projectile at a rate up to 10 rounds per minute . Anti @-@ aircraft defense was provided by four 40 @-@ caliber 3rd Year Type 3 @-@ inch AA guns in single mounts . The 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) high @-@ angle guns had a maximum elevation of + 75 degrees , and had a rate of fire of 13 to 20 rounds per minute . They fired a 6 kg ( 13 lb ) projectile with a muzzle velocity of 680 m / s ( 2 @,@ 200 ft / s ) to a maximum height of 7 @,@ 500 meters ( 24 @,@ 600 ft ) . The ship was also fitted with eight 53 @.@ 3 @-@ centimeter ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes , four on each broadside , two above water and two submerged . They used the 6th Year Type torpedo which had a 203 @-@ kilogram ( 448 lb ) warhead of Shimose powder . It had three settings for range and speed : 15 @,@ 500 meters ( 17 @,@ 000 yd ) at 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) , 10 @,@ 000 meters ( 11 @,@ 000 yd ) at 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) , or 7 @,@ 000 meters ( 7 @,@ 700 yd ) at 37 knots ( 69 km / h ; 43 mph ) . 
 Around 1926 , the four above @-@ water torpedo tubes were removed and the ships received three additional 76 @-@ millimeter AA guns that were situated around the base of the foremast . They were replaced by eight 40 @-@ caliber 12 @.@ 7 @-@ centimeter Type 89 dual @-@ purpose guns in 1932 , fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin @-@ gun mounts . When firing at surface targets , the guns had a range of 14 @,@ 700 meters ( 16 @,@ 100 yd ) . Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute , but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute . Two twin @-@ gun mounts for license @-@ built Vickers 2 @-@ pounder light AA guns were also added to the ship that same year . They had a rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute . 
 When the ships were reconstructed in 1934 – 36 , the remaining torpedo tubes and the two forward 14 @-@ centimeter guns were removed from the hull . All of the remaining 14 @-@ centimeter guns had their elevation increased to + 35 degrees which increased their range to 20 @,@ 000 meters ( 22 @,@ 000 yd ) . An unknown number of license @-@ built 13 @.@ 2 @-@ millimeter Hotchkiss machine guns in twin mounts were also added . The maximum range of these guns was 6 @,@ 500 meters ( 7 @,@ 100 yd ) , but the effective range against aircraft was 700 – 1 @,@ 500 meters ( 770 – 1 @,@ 640 yd ) . The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute , but the need to change 30 @-@ round magazines reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute . 
 The 2 @-@ pounders were replaced in 1939 by 20 license @-@ built Hotchkiss 25 @-@ millimeter Type 96 light AA guns in a mixture of twin @-@ gun and single mounts . This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II , but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon . According to historian Mark Stille , the twin and triple mounts " lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation ; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets ; the gun exhibited excessive vibration ; the magazine was too small , and , finally , the gun produced excessive muzzle blast " . These 25 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) guns had an effective range of 1 @,@ 500 – 3 @,@ 000 meters ( 1 @,@ 600 – 3 @,@ 300 yd ) . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the 15 @-@ round magazines . As far as is known , no additional AA guns were installed aboard Mutsu before her loss . Additional 25 @-@ millimeter guns were installed aboard Nagato during the war ; on 10 July 1944 , she was reported to have 98 guns on board . An additional 30 guns were added during a refit in Yokosuka in November . Two more twin 127 @-@ millimeter gun mounts were added at the same time abreast the funnel and all of her 14 @-@ centimeter guns were removed as she was now a floating anti @-@ aircraft battery . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The Nagato @-@ class ships ' waterline armor belt was made from Vickers cemented armor and protected 137 @.@ 14 meters ( 449 @.@ 9 ft ) of the hull between the barbettes of the end turrets . The lower strake was 305 mm ( 12 in ) thick , 2 @.@ 7 meters ( 8 ft 10 in ) high , and tapered to a thickness of 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) at its bottom edge ; above it was a strake of 229 mm ( 9 in ) armor that was 1 @.@ 7 meters ( 5 ft 7 in ) high . Approximately 1 @.@ 77 meters ( 5 ft 10 in ) of the armor belt was below the waterline . The turrets were protected with an armor thickness of 305 mm on the face , 230 – 190 mm ( 9 @.@ 1 – 7 @.@ 5 in ) on the sides , and 152 – 127 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 – 5 @.@ 0 in ) on the roof . The barbettes were protected by armor 305 mm thick , while the casemates of the 140 mm guns were protected by 25 mm armor plates . The sides of the conning tower were 369 mm ( 14 @.@ 5 in ) thick . 
 The main deck armor consisted of three layers of high @-@ tensile steel ( HTS ) 69 mm ( 2 @.@ 7 in ) thick that connected to the top of the upper strake of side armor . The flat portion of the lower deck had one layer of Ducol steel 25 mm thick with two layers of HTS of equal thickness above it . About 3 meters ( 9 ft 10 in ) from the side of the hull , this deck , now composed of three layers of HTS , totaling 75 mm ( 3 in ) in thickness , sloped downwards where it met a short horizontal armored ( three layers of HTS with a total thickness of 66 mm ( 3 in ) ) deck that connected to the main armored belt and the torpedo bulkhead . This was also made up of three 25 mm layers of HTS and curved up and outwards to meet the short horizontal armored deck . It enclosed a water @-@ tight compartment that was 3 @.@ 05 meters ( 10 ft 0 in ) from the side of the ship . It was backed by fuel oil tanks 3 @.@ 13 meters ( 10 ft 3 in ) deep . The outermost void was designed to allow the explosive force of a torpedo 's warhead to dissipate as much as possible while the oil tank was supposed to stop any fragments from penetrating the innermost bulkhead protecting the ship 's vital areas . 
 The new 41 cm turrets installed during their reconstruction were more heavily armored than the original ones . Face armor was increased to 460 mm ( 18 in ) , the sides to 280 mm ( 11 in ) , and the roof to 230 – 250 mm ( 9 – 10 in ) . The armor over the machinery and magazines was increased by 38 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) on the upper deck and 25 mm on the upper armored deck . The torpedo bulges added at the same time were 13 @.@ 5 meters ( 44 ft 3 in ) high and 2 @.@ 84 meters ( 9 ft 4 in ) deep . They were divided into four compartments , the lower two of which were filled with oil and the others remained empty . These additions increased the weight of each ship 's armor to 13 @,@ 032 metric tons ( 12 @,@ 826 long tons ) , 32 @.@ 6 percent of their displacement . In early 1941 , as a preparation for war , the uppermost compartment of the bulges was filled with sealed steel crushing tubes and the barbette armor of both ships was reinforced with 100 mm armor plates above the main deck and 215 mm ( 8 @.@ 5 in ) plates below it .

 The Nagato @-@ class ships were fitted with a 10 @-@ meter ( 32 ft 10 in ) rangefinder in the forward superstructure ; six @-@ meter ( 19 ft 8 in ) and three @-@ meter ( 9 ft 10 in ) anti @-@ aircraft rangefinders were added in the early 1920s . The rangefinders in the two superfiring turrets were replaced by 10 @-@ meter units in 1932 – 33 . 
 They were initially fitted with a Type 13 fire @-@ control system derived from Vickers equipment received during World War I , but this was replaced by an improved Type 14 system around 1925 . It controlled the main and secondary guns ; no provision was made for anti @-@ aircraft fire until the Type 31 fire @-@ control director was introduced in 1932 . A modified Type 14 fire @-@ control system was tested aboard Nagato in 1935 , and later approved for service as the Type 34 . A new anti @-@ aircraft director , designated the Type 94 , used to control the 127 mm AA guns , was introduced in 1937 , although it is unknown when they were installed on the ships . The 25 mm AA guns were controlled by a Type 95 director that was also introduced in 1937 . 
 As far as is known , no radars were installed aboard Mutsu before her loss . While in drydock in May 1943 , a Type 21 air @-@ search radar was installed aboard Nagato on the roof of the 10 @-@ meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast . On 27 June 1944 , two Type 22 surface @-@ search radars were installed on the pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning radars were fitted on her mainmast . 
 = = = Aircraft = = = 
 Nagato was briefly fitted with an 18 @-@ meter ( 59 ft 1 in ) aircraft flying @-@ off platform on No. 2 turret in August 1925 . Yokosuka Ro @-@ go Ko @-@ gata and Heinkel HD 25 floatplanes were tested from it before it was removed early the following year . An additional boom was added to the mainmasts of both ships in 1926 to handle the Yokosuka E1Y then assigned to them . A Hansa @-@ Brandenburg W.33 floatplane was tested aboard Nagato that same year . A catapult was fitted between the mainmast and No. 3 turret in mid @-@ 1933 , a collapsible crane was installed in a portside sponson , and the ships were equipped to operate two or three floatplanes , although no hangar was provided . The sisters began to operate Nakajima E4N2 biplanes until they were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938 . A more powerful catapult was installed in November 1938 to handle heavier aircraft like the one Kawanishi E7K that was added in 1939 – 40 . Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns on 11 February 1943 .

 While Mutsu was still fitting out , the American government decided to call a conference in Washington , D.C. to forestall the massively expensive naval arms race between the United States , the United Kingdom and the Empire of Japan that was developing . The Washington Naval Conference convened on 12 November , and the Americans proposed to scrap virtually every capital ship under construction or fitting out among the participating nations . Mutsu was specifically listed among those to be scrapped even though she had been commissioned a few weeks earlier . This was unacceptable to the Japanese delegation and they agreed to a compromise that allowed them to keep Mutsu in exchange for scrapping the obsolete dreadnought Settsu and a similar arrangement for several American Colorado @-@ class dreadnoughts that were fitting out . 
 Upon commissioning , the sister ships were assigned to the 1st Battleship Division , although Nagato became the flagship of Rear Admiral Sōjirō Tochinai , a role she often fulfilled during her career . The ships hosted Edward , Prince of Wales , and his aide @-@ de @-@ camp Lieutenant Louis Mountbatten in 1922 during the prince 's visit to Japan . After the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake , both ships loaded supplies from Kyushu for the victims on 4 September . They sank the hulk of the obsolete battleship Satsuma on 7 September 1924 during gunnery practice in Tokyo Bay in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty . Nagato became flagship of the Combined Fleet on 1 December 1925 , flying the flag of Admiral Keisuke Okada . The sisters were placed in reserve several times during the 1920s while they were being modernized . Mutsu served as flagship of Emperor Hirohito during the 1927 naval maneuvers and fleet review and again in 1933 . 
 The ships were reconstructed from late 1933 to mid @-@ 1936 . In August 1937 , the sisters transported 3 @,@ 749 men of the 11th Infantry Division to Shanghai during the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War . Their floatplanes bombed targets in Shanghai on 24 August before they returned to Sasebo the following day . Nagato became a training ship on 1 December 1937 until she again became the flagship of the Combined Fleet on 15 December 1938 . The ship participated in an Imperial Fleet Review on 11 October 1940 . The sisters were refitted in 1941 in preparation for war , which included the fitting of external degaussing coils and additional armor for their barbettes .

 Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto issued the code phrase " Niitaka yama nobore " ( Climb Mount Niitaka ) on 2 December 1941 from Nagato at anchor at Hashirajima to signal the 1st Air Fleet ( Kido Butai ) to proceed with its attack on Pearl Harbor . When Japan began the Pacific War on 8 December , the sisters sortied for the Bonin Islands , along with the four ships of Battleship Division 2 and the light carrier Hōshō as distant cover for the fleet attacking Pearl Harbor , and returned six days later . Yamamoto transferred his flag to the new battleship Yamato on 12 February 1942 . 
 In June 1942 , Mutsu and Nagato were assigned to the Main Body of the 1st Fleet during the Battle of Midway , together with Yamato , Hōshō , the light cruiser Sendai and nine destroyers . Following the loss of all four fleet carriers of the " Kido Butai " on 4 June , Yamamoto attempted to lure the American forces west to within range of the Japanese air groups at Wake Island , and into a night engagement with his surface forces , but the American forces withdrew and Mutsu saw no action . After rendezvousing with the remnants of the Striking Force on 6 June , over half of the survivors from the sunken aircraft carriers of the 1st Air Fleet were transferred to Mutsu and Nagato . They arrived at Hashirajima on 14 June . 
 On 14 July , both ships were reassigned to Battleship Division 2 and Nagato became the flagship of the 1st Fleet . She remained in Japanese waters training until August 1942 . Mutsu was transferred to the Advance Force of the 2nd Fleet on 9 August , and departed Yokosuka two days later to support operations during the Guadalcanal Campaign . She arrived at Truk on 17 August . On 20 August , while sailing from Truk to rendezvous with the main body of Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo 's 3rd Fleet , Mutsu , the heavy cruiser Atago , and escorting destroyers unsuccessfully attempted to locate the escort carrier USS Long Island in response to a flying boat detection of the American ship . 
 During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 27 August , Mutsu , assigned to the Support Force , fired four shells at enemy reconnaissance aircraft during what was her first , and only , action of the war . On 7 January 1943 , Mutsu returned to Japan together with the carrier Zuikaku , the heavy cruiser Suzuya and four destroyers . The ship prepared to sortie on 13 April to reinforce the Japanese garrisons in the Aleutian Islands in response to the Battle of the Komandorski Islands , but the operation was cancelled the next day and Mutsu resumed training .

 On 8 June 1943 , Mutsu was moored at Hashirajima when the magazine of her No. 3 turret exploded at 12 : 13 , cutting the ship in half . The forward section capsized almost immediately , but the rear section remained afloat until the early morning of the next day . Nearby ships were able to rescue 353 survivors from the 1 @,@ 474 crew members and visitors aboard Mutsu , meaning that 1 @,@ 121 men were killed in the explosion . To avert the potential damage to morale from the loss of a battleship , Mutsu 's loss was declared a state secret . To further prevent rumors from spreading , many survivors were reassigned to various garrisons in the Pacific Ocean . 
 The IJN convened a commission three days after the sinking to investigate the loss . It issued its preliminary conclusions on 25 June , well before the investigation of the wreck was completed , and decided that the explosion was the result of a disgruntled seaman . The commission failed to consider the possibility of fire , which historian Mike Williams considers to be a possible cause , as a number of observers noted smoke coming from the vicinity of No. 3 turret . The truth , however , will never be known .

 Nagato transferred to Truk in the Caroline Islands in August 1943 . Together with the bulk of the 1st Fleet , she sortied in September and October in unsuccessful searches for American carriers . On 1 February 1944 , Nagato departed Truk to avoid an American air raid , and arrived at Palau three days later . The ship arrived on 21 February at Lingga Island , near Singapore , and she became the flagship of Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki , commander of Battleship Division 1 , on 25 February until he transferred his flag to Yamato on 5 May . Nagato remained at Lingga until 11 May when she was transferred to Tawitawi on 12 May , and assigned to the 1st Mobile Fleet , under the command of Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa . 
 Battleship Division 1 rendezvoused with Ozawa 's main force on 16 June near the Mariana Islands , and Nagato escorted three aircraft carriers during the Battle of the Philippine Sea . She was only lightly engaged during the battle , was not damaged , and suffered no casualties . After the battle , the ship returned to Japan where she was refitted with additional radars and light AA guns . Nagato loaded a regiment of the 28th Infantry Division and delivered them at Okinawa on 11 July before continuing on to Lingga . 
 In October 1944 , the ship took part in " Operation Sho @-@ 1 " , an attack on the Allied landings on Leyte . Assigned to Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita 's 1st Diversion Force ( also known as the Center Force ) , Nagato was attacked by multiple waves of American dive bombers and fighters during the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea on 24 October en route to Leyte Gulf . She was struck twice by bombs that killed 52 crewmen , but was not seriously damaged . 
 The next morning , the 1st Diversion Force attacked the American forces supporting the invasion in the Battle off Samar . Nagato engaged the escort carriers and destroyers of Task Group 77 @.@ 4 @.@ 3 , codenamed " Taffy 3 " . She opened fire on three escort carriers , the first time she had fired her guns at an enemy ship , but missed . One of the defending destroyers fired a spread of torpedoes that missed their intended target and headed for Yamato and Nagato which were on a parallel course . The two battleships were forced to turn away north to avoid the torpedoes , and were 10 miles ( 16 km ) away from the engagement before the torpedoes ran out of fuel . Turning back , Nagato engaged the American ships , claiming damage to one cruiser . Later in the day , Nagato was hit in the bow by two bombs , but the damage was not severe . 
 The ship returned to Japan for repairs in mid @-@ November . Lack of fuel and materials meant that she could not be brought back into service and she was turned into a floating anti @-@ aircraft battery . Her funnel and mainmast were removed to improve the arcs of fire of her AA guns , which were increased by two Type 89 mounts and nine triple 25 mm gun mounts . Her forward secondary guns were removed in compensation . A coal @-@ burning donkey boiler was installed on the pier for heating and cooking purposes and a converted submarine chaser was moored alongside to provide steam and electricity ; her anti @-@ aircraft guns lacked full power and were only partially operational . On 20 April Nagato was reduced to reserve . In June 1945 , all of her secondary guns and about half of her anti @-@ aircraft armament was moved ashore , together with her rangefinders and searchlights . Her crew was therefore reduced to less than 1 @,@ 000 officers and enlisted men . On 18 July 1945 , the heavily camouflaged ship was attacked by carrier @-@ based fighter bombers and torpedo bombers . Nagato was hit by two bombs and a rocket that killed 35 men and damaged four 25 mm guns . On 30 August , a few days before the formal surrender , American sailors took control of the ship .

 Nagato was selected to participate as a target ship in Operation Crossroads , a series of U.S. nuclear weapon tests held at Bikini Atoll in mid @-@ 1946 . In mid @-@ March , Nagato departed Yokosuka for Eniwetok , but her hull had not been repaired from the underwater damage sustained during the attack on 18 July and she leaked enough that her pumps could not keep up . The ship had a list of seven degrees to port by the time tugboats from Eniwetok arrived . She reached the atoll on 4 April and Bikini in May . 
 Operation Crossroads began with the first blast ( Test Able ) , an air burst on 1 July 1946 ; Nagato was not close to ground zero and was only lightly damaged . For Test Baker , an underwater explosion , the ship was positioned closer to ground zero . Nagato rode out the tsunami of water from the explosion with little apparent damage ; she had a slight starboard list of two degrees after the tsunami dissipated . A more thorough assessment could not be made because she was dangerously radioactive . Her list gradually increased over the next five days and she capsized during the night of 29 / 30 July . Opened to divers in 1996 , The Times has named Nagato as one of the top 10 wreck diving sites in the world . 
 In 1970 , salvage operations began on Mutsu 's wreck that lasted until 1978 and recovered about 75 % of the ship . The salvagers recovered bodies of 849 crewmen killed during the explosion . In 1995 , the Mutsu Memorial Museum declared that no further salvage operations were planned . The only significant portion of the ship that remains is a 35 @-@ meter ( 114 ft 10 in ) long section running from the bridge structure forward to the vicinity of No. 1 turret . The highest portion of the ship is 12 meters ( 39 ft 4 in ) below the surface . Many , but not all , artifacts are displayed at the Mutsu Memorial Museum in Tōwa @-@ Cho . Since 1963 , a memorial service has been held there every year on 8 June in honor of the crew . 
 = School of Advanced Military Studies = 
 The School of Advanced Military Studies ( SAMS ) is one of four United States Army schools that make up the United States Army Command and General Staff College ( CGSC ) at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas . This " enormously rigorous " graduate school comprises two programs : the larger Advanced Military Studies Program ( AMSP ) , and the Advanced Operational Art Studies Fellowship ( AOASF ) , which more senior officers attend . The student body is small but diverse and comprises members of each of the U.S. armed forces , various U.S. Government agencies , and allied military forces . Graduates are colloquially known as " Jedi Knights " . 
 The school educates the future leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces , its Allies , and the Interagency at the graduate level to be agile and adaptive leaders who think critically at the strategic and operational levels to solve complex ambiguous problems . 
 SAMS graduates are innovative leaders , willing to accept risk and to experiment . They are adaptive leaders who excel at the art of command and anticipate the future operational environment by applying critical & creative thinking skills in order to solve complex problems . All graduates demonstrate mastery of Operational Art and Doctrine and are able to synthesize the elements of US national power in Joint , Interagency , Intergovernmental and Multinational ( <unk> ) operations . 
 The school issues a masters degree in Military Art and Science , and provides its graduates with the skills to deal with the disparate challenges encountered in contemporary military and government operations . The modern course produces " leaders with the flexibility of mind to solve complex operational and strategic problems in peace , conflict , and war " . Various senior military leaders have recognized the contributions of SAMS graduates in supporting global contingency operations . 
 The first class began at the school in mid @-@ 1983 and 13 students graduated the following year . Due to increasing requirements for SAMS graduates in the U.S. military , the army expanded the school in the 1990s , and in 2010 over 120 students graduated . Since the school 's inception , SAMS planners have supported every major U.S. military campaign , providing the army " with many of its top campaign planners for the late twentieth and early twenty @-@ first centuries " . 
 = = History = = 
 The SAMS course was designed to fill a gap in U.S. military education between the CGSC 's focus on tactics and the War College 's focus on grand strategy and national security policy . In 1981 , Colonel Huba Wass de Czege convinced Fort Leavenworth 's Lieutenant General William R. Richardson , who served as Commander of the Combined Arms Center and Commandant of the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth from 1979 to 1981 , that a second year of military education was needed for select officers . After receiving final approval , Wass de Czege helped plan and develop the school , which would open in mid @-@ 1983 . Although there was some disagreement about the purpose of the course , army leaders and the course designers settled on a plan to provide officers with a " broad , deep military education in the science and art of war . " 
 In June 1983 , the first class of 13 U.S. Army students began in the basement of Bell Hall at Fort Leavenworth . Initially , there were some internal problems with facilities and scheduling , and in the school 's early years there was uncertainty whether its graduates would be accepted and how they would perform in the force . When the first class graduated in 1984 , SAMS had already become " the symbol for intellectual renaissance in the officer corps " . When the first director , Wass de Czege , was succeeded by Colonel Richard <unk> in 1985 , the school was already beginning to produce results and the U.S. Army and the College regarded SAMS as a " useful experiment " . By 1987 , enrollment of high @-@ quality officers had risen and sister services were becoming interested in sending students to SAMS . The program 's growing popularity and reputation also began attracting students from allied countries . 
 SAMS graduates first saw active service in December 1989 during Operation Just Cause in Panama . A core planning cell of seven SAMS graduates " crafted a well rehearsed and well executed plan that simultaneously struck some roughly 50 objectives in a single coordinated blow " . According to Colonel Kevin Benson , the tenth director of the school , " The Army and SAMS faced a test of battle and the new group of highly @-@ educated planners appeared to have passed the test with flying colors . " After its mission in Panama , the army 's leaders began to draw on SAMS to assist in additional ways . In the early 1990s , U.S. Army leaders called upon the school to help develop army doctrine . Lieutenant Colonel Thomas E. Mitchell , Colonel James McDonough ( the fifth SAMS director ) , and other members of the SAMS team helped revise the U.S. Army Doctrinal Manual 100 @-@ 5 Operations in 1990 – 1993 . 
 Lieutenant General Guy C. Swan noted that SAMS graduates were indispensable in Europe after the fall of the Berlin wall and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact . They were expected to " re @-@ engineer the decades of planning that had gone into the GDP [ General Defense Plan ] almost overnight " . Swan stated that this was " the first true test of SAMS on a large scale " . SAMS graduates served in Operation Desert Shield / Desert Storm , and were " remembered most famously in the early days for producing the ' Jedi Knights ' employed by Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf in developing the famous ' left hook ' " . SAMS graduates also served in roles beyond the initial planning , with 82 graduates participating in diverse theater tasks by February 1991 . As a result , U.S. Army leadership regarded SAMS as a source of " superb planners " . 
 After Desert Storm , the army struggled with military operations other than war , such as peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations . The school and its graduates examined the situations in Bosnia , Haiti , and Somalia . Graduates also participated in Defense Support of Civil authorities missions . The course continued to change in the 1990s . Under Colonel Gregory Fontenot , the school moved from Fort Leavenworth 's Flint Hall to Eisenhower Hall in October 1994 . In later years , the school 's leadership expanded the number of seminars and the civilian faculty . The military continues to draw heavily on SAMS in the twenty @-@ first century . SAMS planners have played a significant role in the Global War on Terror . Beginning in 2002 , the United States Central Command requested planners from SAMS and its sister schools , the United States Air Force 's School of Advanced Air and Space Studies ( <unk> ) , which was designed to be similar to SAMS , and the United States Marine Corps 's School of Advanced Warfighting ( SAW ) . SAMS students from the 2002 and 2003 classes participated as planners in the preparations for the invasion of Iraq and the plan for the post @-@ combat occupation . 
 The school continued to change and develop , and an additional faculty expansion occurred in 2005 – 2006 . Also , the Fellows ' curriculum shifted further away from that of the AMSP program . To keep pace with increasing demand for SAMS planners , the commander of the army 's Training and Doctrine Command directed an expansion that was approved by the Chief of Staff of the Army , and the school 's 11th director , Colonel Steve Banach , began a winter @-@ start course in 2007 . During this period , SAMS provided planners to help forward @-@ deployed headquarters plan operations and contingencies . The school moved to new premises in the newly renovated Muir Hall at Fort Leavenworth on 30 August 2011 . 
 = = Contributions = = 
 SAMS graduates have supported every major U.S. military campaign between 1984 and 2009 . SAMS graduates are known for their " critical thinking skill sets " , and are consistently called for by combatant commanders around the world . In 2010 , Brigadier General Sean MacFarland said , " In a crisis , the president always asks , ' where are the aircraft carriers ? ' In the Army , leaders ask , ' Where are the SAMS graduates ? ' Just as the aircraft carrier was a game changer in naval warfare , SAMS graduates and practitioners of operational art have been game changers in land warfare . " 
 The school has been praised by senior U.S. military leaders . According to Major General David Hogg , " SAMS has a reputation for producing skilled planners that can take complex ideas and develop cohesive plans . " In 2010 , army Vice Chief of Staff Peter W. Chiarelli said that SAMS was " at the forefront of the effort to remake strategic military planning for the 21st century " . 
 = = Facilities and Student Body = = 
 As of 2014 , the SAMS teaching facilities are mainly housed in Muir Hall ( image right ) , which was once a stable , and Flint Hall . The AMSP courses are taught mostly in Muir Hall — the current SAMS headquarters — while Flint Hall houses additional AMSP seminars and the AOASF seminars . Both buildings were renovated in 2011 and their classrooms accommodate seminars of about 16 – 18 students and an instructor . The renovations for Muir Hall cost $ 12 @.@ 2 million , including $ 3 million in information systems that allow students to collaborate digitally , replicating a common practice seen in militaries today . 
 The application process includes an examination , an interview , and a supervisor assessment . Applicants must also complete the U.S. Army 's Command and General Staff School or an equivalent intermediate @-@ level education course offered by another uniformed service . The student body of SAMS comprises mostly U.S. Army field grade officers from combat , combat support , and combat service support branches . However , in 1987 the U.S. Air Force graduated three officers and officers from the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps graduated the following years . U.S. government agencies began sending students to SAMS in 2007 . The Department of State , Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) have provided students to the school . Also , Warrant officers first attended SAMS in 2010 . 
 Allied foreign militaries also provide students . In 1999 , the school graduated its first international officers — Norwegian and Canadian . Argentina , Australia , Colombia , France , Germany , Hungary , India , Jordan , Republic of Macedonia , the Netherlands , Pakistan , Romania , South Korea , Brazil , Spain , and the United Kingdom have also sent students through the course .

 = = = Advanced Military Studies Program = = = 
 Most students participate in the Advanced Military Studies Program ( AMSP ) . In 2009 , the school held eight AMSP seminars . AMSP is intended to educate students in " military arts and science " , and focuses on operational art and covers a variety of subjects , including military problem solving ; military theory and history , military doctrine , operational planning ; battle dynamics , operational theory and practice , contemporary military operations , and the application of national elements of power . Besides classroom studies and operational exercises , students must complete a research monograph and an oral examination . After graduating , officers serve on a division , corps , or Army Service Component Command staff , or in a functional area assignment . 
 = = = Advanced Operational Art Studies Fellowship = = = 
 The AOASF is the school 's senior program , and focuses on planning and executing full @-@ spectrum operations with government and nongovernmental agencies . Its students comprise senior lieutenant colonels , colonels , and their civilian equivalents . Military AOASF fellows have typically commanded a battalion @-@ sized unit in the armed services . The course is equivalent to the U.S. Army War College , and instructs 16 students annually . 
 The program began in 1984 as the Advanced Operational Studies Fellowship ( <unk> ) by diverting lieutenant colonel War College <unk> to Fort Leavenworth for an equivalent education program ; these officers remained for a second year to help instruct AMSP students . Because highly qualified officers could not remain at the faculty permanently , this program was designed to mitigate the effects of periodic faculty reassignments due to operational requirements . The <unk> program allowed students to complete the AMSP and then serve as the principal instructor of the AMSP during their second year . In 1995 , the name of the program was changed to its current version , and in the early 21st century its curriculum was closer aligned with the strategic level of war . 
 During the first year , the AOASF curriculum includes classroom investigation of the multinational , joint and interagency environment , and extensive travel to the U.S. Defense Department 's regional commands and headquarters . In the second year , students become instructors of an AMSP seminar or take up other positions in the school . This course focuses on the operational and strategic realms of war and prepares students for assignments as leaders and to serve in critical staff positions within combatant and service component commands . The course involves extensive travel , and the study of applied strategy , military theory , military history , strategic studies , campaign planning , regional studies , and practical work in joint planning . Fellows completing AOASF receive credit as a United States Army War College graduate , and typically serve in a follow @-@ on command assignment or work for a three- or four @-@ star general officer as a member of his or her staff .
