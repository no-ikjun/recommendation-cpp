 Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch , a linguist and cartographer at the Smithsonian who was recruited to decipher The Shepherd 's Journal while directing an expedition to Atlantis . Kirk Wise , one of the directors , said that they chose Fox for the role because they felt he gave his character his own personality and made them more believable on screen . Fox said that voice acting was much easier than his past experience with live action because he did not have to worry about what he looked like in front of a camera while delivering his lines . The directors mentioned that Fox was also offered a role for Titan A.E. ; he allowed his son to choose which film he would work on , and he chose Atlantis . Viewers have noted similarities between Milo and the film 's language consultant , Marc Okrand , who developed the Atlantean language used in the film . Okrand stated that Milo 's supervising animator , John Pomeroy , sketched him , claiming not to know how a linguist looked or acted . 
 James Garner as Commander Lyle Tiberius Rourke , the leader of the band of mercenaries , for the Atlantean expedition . Wise chose Garner because of his previous experience with action films , especially war and Western films , and said the role " fits him like a glove " . When asked if he would be interested in the role , Garner replied " I 'd do it in a heartbeat . " 
 Cree Summer as <unk> " Kida " Nedakh , the Princess of Atlantis . Kida 's supervising animator , Randy Haycock , stated that Summer was very " intimidating " when he first met her ; this influenced how he wanted Kida to look and act on screen when she meets Milo . Natalie Strom provided dialogue for Kida as a young child . 
 Don Novello as Vincenzo " Vinny " Santorini , an Italian demolitions expert . Kirk Wise and Russ Edmonds , Vinny 's supervising animator , noted Novello 's unique ability to improvise dialogue . Edmonds recalled , " [ Novello ] would look at the sheet , and he would read the line that was written once , and he would never read it again ! And we never used a written line , it was <unk> , the whole movie . " 
 Phil Morris as Doctor Joshua <unk> Sweet , a medic of African American and Native American descent . Sweet 's supervising animator , Ron Husband , indicated that one of the challenges was animating Sweet in sync with Morris ' rapid line delivery while keeping him believable . Morris stated that this character was extreme , with " no middle ground " ; he mentioned , " When he was happy , he was really happy , and when he 's solemn , he 's real solemn . " 
 Claudia Christian as Lieutenant Helga Katrina Sinclair , Rourke 's German second @-@ in @-@ command . Christian described her character as " sensual " and " striking " . She was relieved when she finally saw what her character looked like , joking , " I 'd hate to , you know , go through all this and find out my character is a toad . " 
 Jacqueline Obradors as Audrey Rocio Ramirez , a teenage Puerto Rican mechanic and the youngest member of the expedition . Obradors said her character made her " feel like a little kid again " and she always hoped her sessions would last longer . 
 Florence Stanley as Wilhelmina Bertha Packard : an elderly , sarcastic , chain @-@ smoking radio operator . Stanley felt that Packard was very " cynical " and " secure " : " She does her job and when she is not busy she does anything she wants . " 
 David Ogden Stiers as Fenton Q. Harcourt , a board member of the Smithsonian Institution who dismisses Milo 's belief in the existence of Atlantis . Stiers previously worked with Michael J. Fox in Doc Hollywood . He earlier voice @-@ acted for Disney in Beauty and the Beast , Pocahontas , and The Hunchback of Notre Dame and would do so again in Lilo & Stitch . 
 John Mahoney as Preston B. Whitmore , an eccentric millionaire who funds the expedition to Atlantis . Lloyd Bridges was originally cast and recorded as Whitmore , but he died before completing the film . Mahoney 's zest and vigor led to Whitmore 's personality being reworked for the film . Mahoney stated that doing voice work was " freeing " and allowed him to be " big " and " outrageous " with his character . 
 Jim Varney as <unk> Allardyce " Cookie " Farnsworth , a Western @-@ style chuckwagon chef . Varney died of lung cancer in February 2000 , before the production ended , and the film was dedicated to his memory . Producer Don Hahn was saddened that Varney never saw the finished film , but mentioned that he was shown clips of his character 's performance during his site sessions and said , " He loved it . " Shawn Keller , supervising animator for Cookie , stated , " It was kind of a sad fact that [ Varney ] knew that he was not going to be able to see this film before he passed away . He did a bang @-@ up job doing the voice work , knowing the fact that he was never gonna see his last performance . " 
 Corey Burton as Gaëtan " Mole " Molière , a French geologist who acts like a mole . Burton mentioned that finding his performance as Mole was by allowing the character to " leap out " of him while making funny voices . To get into character during his recording sessions , he stated that he would " throw myself into the scene and feel like I 'm in this make @-@ believe world " . 
 Leonard Nimoy as <unk> Nedakh , the King of Atlantis and Kida 's father . Michael Cedeno , supervising animator for King Nedakh , was astounded at Nimoy 's voice talent , stating that he had " so much rich character " in his performance . As he spoke his lines , <unk> said the crew would sit there and watch Nimoy in astonishment .

 The idea for Atlantis : The Lost Empire was conceived in October 1996 when Don Hahn , Gary Trousdale , Kirk Wise , and Tab Murphy lunched at a Mexican restaurant in Burbank , California . Having recently completed The Hunchback of Notre Dame the producer and directors wanted to keep the Hunchback crew together for another film with an Adventureland setting . Drawing inspiration from Jules Verne 's A Journey to the Center of the Earth ( 1864 ) , they set out to make a film which would fully explore Atlantis ( compared to the brief visit depicted in Verne 's novel ) . While primarily utilizing the Internet to research the mythology of Atlantis , the filmmakers became interested in the clairvoyant readings of Edgar Cayce and decided to incorporate some of his ideas — notably that of a mother @-@ crystal which provides power , healing , and longevity to the Atlanteans — into the story . They also visited museums and old army installations to study the technology of the early 20th century ( the film 's time period ) , and traveled 800 feet underground in New Mexico 's Carlsbad Caverns to view the subterranean trails which would serve as a model for the approach to Atlantis in the film . 
 The filmmakers wanted to avoid the common depiction of Atlantis as " crumbled Greek columns underwater " , said Wise . " From the get @-@ go , we were committed to designing it top to bottom . Let 's get the architectural style , clothing , heritage , customs , how they would sleep , and how they would speak . So we brought people on board who would help us develop those ideas . " Art director David Goetz stated , " We looked at Mayan architecture , styles of ancient , unusual architecture from around the world , and the directors really liked the look of Southeast Asian architecture . " The team later took ideas from other architectural forms , including Cambodian , Indian , and Tibetan works . Hahn added , " If you take and deconstruct architecture from around the world into one architectural vocabulary , that 's what our Atlantis looks like . " The overall design and circular layout of Atlantis were also based on the writings of Plato , and his quote " in a single day and night of misfortune , the island of Atlantis disappeared into the depths of the sea " was influential from the beginning of production . The crew wore T @-@ shirts which read " <unk> — Fewer songs , more explosions " due the film 's plan as an action @-@ adventure ( unlike previous Disney animated features , which were musicals ) . 
 = = = = Language = = = = 
 Marc Okrand , who developed the Klingon language for the Star Trek films , was hired to devise the Atlantean language for Atlantis : The Lost Empire . Guided by the directors ' initial concept for it to be a " mother @-@ language " , Okrand employed an Indo @-@ European word stock with its own grammatical structure . He would change the words if they began to sound too much like an actual , spoken language . John Emerson designed the written component , making hundreds of random sketches of individual letters from among which the directors chose the best to represent the Atlantean alphabet . The written language was boustrophedon : designed to be read left @-@ to @-@ right on the first line , then right @-@ to @-@ left on the second , continuing in a zigzag pattern to simulate the flow of water . 
 The Atlantean [ A ] is a shape developed by John Emerson . It is a miniature map of the city of Atlantis ( i.e. , the outside of the swirl is the cave , the inside shape is the silhouette of the city , and the dot is the location of the crystal ) . It 's a treasure map . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Joss Whedon was the first writer to be involved with the film , but soon left to work on other Disney projects . According to him , he " had not a shred " in a movie . Tab Murphy completed the screenplay , stating that the time from initially discussing the story to producing a script that satisfied the film crew was " about three to four months " . The initial draft was 155 pages , much longer than a typical Disney film script ( which usually runs 90 pages ) . When the first two acts were timed at 120 minutes , the directors cut characters and sequences and focused more on Milo . Murphy said that he created the centuries @-@ old Shepherd 's Journal because he needed a map for the characters to follow throughout their journey . A revised version of the script eliminated the trials encountered by the explorers as they navigated the underground caves to Atlantis . This gave the film a faster pace , because Atlantis is discovered earlier in the story . 
 The character of Milo J. Thatch was originally supposed to be a descendant of Edward Teach , otherwise known as Blackbeard the pirate . The directors later related him to an explorer so he would discover his inner talent for exploration . The character of Molière was originally intended to be " professorial " but Chris Ure , a story artist , changed the concept to that of a " horrible little burrowing creature with a wacky coat and strange headgear with extending eyeballs " , said Wise . Don Hahn pointed out that the absence of songs presented a challenge for a team accustomed to animating musicals , as solely action scenes would have to carry the film . Kirk Wise said it gave the team an opportunity for more on @-@ screen character development : " We had more screen time available to do a scene like where Milo and the explorers are camping out and learning about one another 's histories . An entire sequence is devoted to having dinner and going to bed . That is not typically something we would have the luxury of doing . " 
 Hahn stated that the first animated sequence completed during production was the film 's prologue . The original version featured a Viking war party using The Shepherd 's Journal to find Atlantis and being swiftly dispatched by the Leviathan . Near the end of production , story supervisor Jon Sanford told the directors that he felt this prologue did not give viewers enough emotional involvement with the Atlanteans . Despite knowing that the Viking prologue was finished and it would cost additional time and money to alter the scene , the directors agreed with Sanford . Trousdale went home and completed the storyboards later that evening . The opening was replaced by a sequence depicting the destruction of Atlantis , which introduced the film from the perspective of the Atlanteans and Princess Kida . The Viking prologue is included as an extra feature on the DVD release .

 At the peak of its production , 350 animators , artists and technicians were working on Atlantis at all three Disney animation studios : Walt Disney Feature Animation ( Burbank , California ) , Disney Feature Animation Florida ( Orlando ) , and Disney Animation France ( Paris ) . The film was one of the few Disney animated features produced and shot in 70mm anamorphic format . The directors felt that a widescreen image was crucial , as a nostalgic reference to old action @-@ adventure films presented in the CinemaScope format ( 2 @.@ 35 : 1 ) , noting Raiders of the Lost Ark as an inspiration . Because switching to the format would require animation desks and equipment designed for widescreen to be purchased , Disney executives were at first reluctant about the idea . The production team found a simple solution by drawing within a smaller frame on the same paper and equipment used for standard aspect ratio ( 1 @.@ 66 : 1 ) Disney @-@ animated films . Layout supervisor Ed <unk> wrote a guide to the widescreen format for use by the layout artists and mentioned that one advantage of widescreen was that he could keep characters in scenes longer because of additional space to walk within the frame . Wise drew further inspiration for the format from filmmakers David Lean and Akira Kurosawa . 
 The film 's visual style was strongly based upon that of Mike Mignola , the comic book artist behind Hellboy . Mignola was one of four production designers ( along with Matt Codd , Jim Martin , and Ricardo Delgado ) hired by the Disney studio for the film . Accordingly , he provided style guides , preliminary character and background designs , and story ideas . " Mignola 's graphic , angular style was a key influence on the ' look ' of the characters , " stated Wise . Mignola was surprised when first contacted by the studio to work on Atlantis . His artistic influence on the film would later contribute to a cult following . 
 I remember watching a rough cut of the film and these characters have these big , square , weird hands . I said to the guy next to me , " Those are cool hands . " And he says to me , " Yeah , they 're your hands . We had a whole meeting about how to do your hands . " It was so weird I couldn 't wrap my brain around it . 
 The final pull @-@ out scene of the movie , immediately before the end @-@ title card , was described by the directors as the most difficult scene in the history of Disney animation . They said that the pullout attempt on their prior film , The Hunchback of Notre Dame , " struggled " and " lacked depth " ; however , after making advances in the process of <unk> , they tried the technique again in Atlantis . The scene begins with one 16 @-@ inch piece of paper showing a close @-@ up of Milo and Kida . As the camera pulls away from them to reveal the newly restored Atlantis , it reaches the equivalent of an 18 @,@ 000 @-@ inch piece of paper composed of many individual pieces of paper ( 24 inches or smaller ) . Each piece was carefully drawn and combined with animated vehicles simultaneously flying across the scene to make the viewer see a complete , integrated image . 
 At the time of its release , Atlantis : The Lost Empire was notable for using more computer @-@ generated imagery ( CGI ) than any other Disney @-@ animated feature . To increase productivity , the directors had the digital artists work with the traditional animators throughout the production . Several important scenes required heavy use of digital animation : the Leviathan , the Ulysses submarine and sub @-@ pods , the Heart of Atlantis , and the Stone Giants . During production , after Matt Codd and Jim Martin designed the Ulysses on paper , Greg Aronowitz was hired to build a scale model of the submarine , to be used as a reference for drawing the 3D Ulysses . The final film included 362 digital @-@ effects shots , and computer programs were used to seamlessly join the 2D and 3D artwork . One scene that took advantage of this was the " sub @-@ drop " scene , where the 3D Ulysses was dropped from its docking bay into the water . As the camera floated toward it , a 2D Milo was drawn to appear inside , tracking the camera . The crew noted that it was challenging to keep the audience from noticing the difference between the 2D and 3D drawings when they were merged . The digital production also gave the directors a unique " virtual camera " for complicated shots within the film . With the ability to operate in the z @-@ plane , this camera moved through a digital wire @-@ frame set ; the background and details were later hand @-@ drawn over the wire frames . This was used in the opening flight scene through Atlantis and the submarine chase through the undersea cavern with the Leviathan in pursuit . 
 = = = Music and sound = = = 
 Since the film would not feature any songs , the directors hired James Newton Howard to compose the score . Approaching it as a live @-@ action film , Howard decided to have different musical themes for the cultures of the surface world and Atlantis . In the case of Atlantis , Howard chose an Indonesian orchestral sound incorporating chimes , bells , and gongs . The directors told Howard that the film would have a number of key scenes without dialogue ; the score would need to convey emotionally what the viewer was seeing on screen . 
 Gary Rydstrom and his team at Skywalker Sound were hired for the film 's sound production . Like Howard , Rydstrom employed different sounds for the two cultures . Focusing on the machine and mechanical sounds of the early industrial era for the explorers , he felt that the Atlanteans should have a " more organic " sound utilizing ceramics and pottery . The sound made by the Atlantean flying @-@ fish vehicles posed a particular challenge . Rydstrom revealed that he was sitting at the side of a highway recording one day when a semi @-@ truck drove by at high speed . When the recording was sped up on his computer he felt it sounded very organic , and that is what is heard within the film . Rydstrom created the harmonic chiming of the Heart of Atlantis by rubbing his finger along the edge of a champagne flute , and the sound of sub @-@ pods moving through water with a water pick .

 Before the film 's release , reporters speculated that it would have a difficult run due to competition from DreamWorks ' Shrek ( a wholly CGI feature ) and Lara Croft : Tomb Raider ( an action @-@ adventure film from Paramount Pictures ) . Regarding the market 's shift from traditional animation and competition with CGI films , Kirk Wise said , " Any traditional animator , including myself , can 't help but feel a twinge . I think it always comes down to story and character , and one form won 't replace the other . Just like photography didn 't replace painting . But maybe I 'm blind to it . " Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly noted that CGI films ( such as Shrek ) were more likely to attract the teenage demographic typically not interested in animation , and called Atlantis a " marketing and creative gamble " .

 The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 49 % of 140 professional critics have given Atlantis : The Lost Empire a positive review , with a rating average of 5 @.@ 5 out of 10 . The site 's consensus is that " Atlantis provides a fast @-@ paced spectacle , but stints on such things as character development and a coherent plot " . Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 52 out of 100 based on 29 reviews from mainstream critics ; this was considered " mixed or average reviews " . CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend revealed the average grade cinema @-@ goers gave Atlantis : The Lost Empire was an " A " on an A + -to @-@ F scale . 
 While critics had mixed reactions to the film in general , some praised it for its visuals , action @-@ adventure elements , and its attempt to appeal to an older audience . Roger Ebert gave Atlantis three @-@ and @-@ half stars out of four . He praised the animation 's " clean bright visual look " and the " classic energy of the comic book style " , crediting this to the work of Mike Mignola . Ebert gave particular praise to the story and the final battle scene and wrote , " The story of Atlantis is rousing in an old pulp science fiction sort of way , but the climactic scene transcends the rest , and stands by itself as one of the great animated action sequences . " In The New York Times , Elvis Mitchell gave high praise to the film , calling it " a monumental treat " , and stated , " Atlantis is also one of the most eye @-@ catching Disney cartoons since Uncle Walt institutionalized the four @-@ fingered glove . " James Berardinelli , film critic for ReelViews , wrote a positive review of the film , giving it three out of four stars . He wrote , " On the whole , Atlantis offers 90 minutes of solid entertainment , once again proving that while Disney may be clueless when it comes to producing good live @-@ action movies , they are exactly the opposite when it comes to their animated division . " Wesley Morris of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote positively of the film 's approach for an older audience : " But just beneath the surface , Atlantis brims with adult possibility . " 
 Other critics felt that the film was mediocre in regards to its story and characters , and that it failed to deliver as a non @-@ musical to Disney 's traditional audience . Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C + rating , writing that the movie had " gee @-@ whiz formulaic character " and was " the essence of craft without dream " . Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times noted the storyline and characterizations were " old @-@ fashioned " and the film had the retrograde look of a Saturday @-@ morning cartoon , but these deficiencies were offset by its " brisk action " and frantic pace . Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote , " Disney pushes into all @-@ talking , no @-@ singing , no @-@ dancing and , in the end , no @-@ fun animated territory . " Stephanie Zacharek of Salon loathed the film , specifically Disney 's attempt to make the film for an adult audience , of which she wrote , " The big problem with Disney 's latest animated feature , Atlantis : The Lost Empire , is that it doesn 't seem geared to kids at all : It 's so adult that it 's massively boring . " Rita Kempley of The Washington Post panned the film , calling it a " new @-@ fashioned but old @-@ fangled hash " and wrote , " Ironically Disney had hoped to update its image with this mildly diverting adventure , yet the picture hasn 't really broken away from the tried @-@ and @-@ true format spoofed in the far superior Shrek . " 
 = = = Themes and interpretations = = = 
 Several critics and scholars have noted that Atlantis plays strongly on themes of anti @-@ capitalism and anti @-@ imperialism . M. Keith Booker , academic and author of studies about the implicit messages conveyed by media , views the character of Rourke as being motivated by " capitalist greed " when he pursues " his own financial gain " in spite of the knowledge that " his theft [ of the crystal ] will lead to the destruction of [ Atlantis ] " . Religion journalist Mark Pinsky , in his exploration of moral and spiritual themes in popular Disney films , asserts that " it is impossible to read the movie ... any other way " than as " a devastating , unrelenting attack on capitalism and American imperialism " . Max Messier of <unk> observes , " Disney even manages to <unk> the capitalist lifestyle of the adventurers intent on uncovering the lost city . Damn the imperialists ! " According to Booker , the film also " delivers a rather segregationist moral " by concluding with the discovery of the Atlanteans kept secret from other surface @-@ dwellers in order to maintain a separation between the two highly divergent cultures . Others saw Atlantis as an interesting look at utopian philosophy of the sort found in classic works of science fiction by H. G. Wells and Jules Verne . 
 When the film was released , some viewers noticed that Atlantis : The Lost Empire bore a number of similarities to the 1990 – 1991 Japanese anime television program Nadia : The Secret of Blue Water and the 1986 film Castle in the Sky from Studio Ghibli , particularly in its character design , setting , and story . Although Disney never responded formally to claims of plagiarism , co @-@ director Kirk Wise posted on a Disney animation news group in May 2001 , " Never heard of Nadia till it was mentioned in this [ news group ] . Long after we 'd finished production , I might add . " Both Atlantis and Nadia were inspired , in part , by the 1870 Jules Verne novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea , of which Lee Zion ( reporting for Anime News Network ) wrote , " There are too many similarities not connected with 20 @,@ 000 Leagues for the whole thing to be coincidence . " Critics also saw parallels with the 1994 film Stargate . Milo 's characteristics were said to resemble those of Daniel Jackson , the protagonist of Stargate and its spinoff television series Stargate SG @-@ 1 — which coincidentally launched its own spinoff , titled Stargate Atlantis .

 = = Plot = = 
 Pam ( Jenna Fischer ) trains a temporary worker Cathy Simms ( Lindsey Broad ) so that she can take her place when she goes on maternity leave . In the break room , the other workers discuss how attractive Cathy is and how excited they are to have her in the office . Pam , being well into her pregnancy , is sensitive about her looks and so becomes offended by their discussion . Most of them respond by assuring Pam that she is , if anything , more sexually attractive than before she was pregnant . Dwight ( Rainn Wilson ) , however , argues that sexual attractiveness is a mostly objective quality and pregnant women cannot be sexually attractive , and accuses the others of lying to spare Pam 's feelings . Troubled by Dwight 's comments , Pam asks her husband Jim ( John Krasinski ) if he finds the new temp attractive . Not wanting to upset his wife , Jim tells her that he does not find her replacement attractive , even objectively . Though Jim gives no sign of unease , Pam is convinced that he is lying to her , and enlists the help of the harshly honest Dwight to prove it . After a number of unsuccessful attempts to trick Jim into revealing he finds Pam 's replacement attractive , Dwight and Pam convince Jim to submit to a lie detection test in the form of a retail store 's blood pressure tester . At the conclusion of the interview , Dwight triumphantly announces that he recorded hypertension when Jim said he does not find the new temp attractive , but as Jim continues to insist he is telling the truth Dwight admits that he recorded equal hypertension on every question , including Jim 's name . Pam realizes that Jim has unusually high blood pressure , which his father also suffers from , and forgets about the issue in order to focus on her husband 's health . 
 Meanwhile , CEO Robert California ( James Spader ) surprises Andy ( Ed Helms ) , Kevin ( Brian Baumgartner ) , and Darryl ( Craig Robinson ) when he asks to join their band after he finds them having a jam session in the warehouse . Soon thereafter , California 's friends , skilled musicians themselves , arrive to join in . Not having brought their own instruments , two of them take over Kevin 's drums and Darryl 's synthesizer , while Andy 's acoustic guitar is drowned out by the newcomer 's electric guitar . The three of them are thus relegated to playing percussion . Andy , Kevin and Darryl , with the help of warehouse worker Val , realize that they were ousted , and after a failed attempt to try getting their original band roles back , they instead satisfyingly jam outside by themselves .

 The episode was written by consulting producer Allison Silverman , her first writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the eighth season . It was directed by Matt Sohn , one of the series ' cinematographers and camera operators , his third directing credit for the series . The episode features a guest appearance from Lindsey Broad , and her character was described as " Pam ’ s competent and likable pal , " Cathy . She appeared in a recurring role in the eighth season . The episode also relates to Pam 's pregnancy . Jenna Fischer was actually pregnant and her pregnancy was written into the series with Pam and Jim having their second baby . The man who played Robert 's skilled drummer friend is Steve Moore , better known as " The Mad Drummer " for a viral video he was featured in .

 " Pam 's Replacement " received generally mixed reviews from critics . HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall complimented the episode for staying true to the characters compared to the rest of the season , which he had criticized in an earlier review . He called the episode a " significant step up " albeit just " decent " in absolute terms . The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt criticized the Andy – Kevin – Darryl subplot for its lack of continuity or any sort of punchlines . He was also critical of the Pam – Dwight plot for not staying true to the characters , and suggested that the writers needed to write the show as less of " a bland copy of itself " . He called it one of the laziest half @-@ hours of the show and gave it a C − . Cindy White of IGN said that the episode needed a stronger A @-@ plot writing that the plots " felt like a meal made up of two tasty side dishes " . She gave it a 7 out of 10 . Hanna Lawrence of Hollywood.com praised the episode for being believable and for showing things that happen in real life . She also praised the Jim – Pam plot for showcasing the couple as not completely " perfect " . She called the band subplot " weak " .

 WASP @-@ 43b is a transiting planet in orbit around the young , active , and low @-@ mass star WASP @-@ 43 in the constellation Sextans . The planet is a Hot Jupiter with a mass twice that of Jupiter , and a radius equal to Jupiter 's . WASP @-@ 43b was flagged as a candidate by the SuperWASP program before they conducted follow @-@ ups using instruments at La Silla Observatory in Chile , which confirmed the planet 's existence and provided orbital and physical characteristics . The planet 's discovery was published on April 14 , 2011 . 
 At the time of its discovery , WASP @-@ 43b had an orbital period of approximately 0 @.@ 8 days ( 19 @.@ 2 hours ) , the second shortest orbit ever detected , surpassed only by WASP @-@ 19b . In addition , at the time of discovery , WASP @-@ 43b was the most closely orbiting Hot Jupiter known , a phenomenon that can most likely be explained by its host star 's low mass .

 WASP @-@ 43 was first flagged as host to a potential transiting event ( when a body crosses in front of and dims its host star ) by data collected by SuperWASP , a British organization working to discover transiting planets across the entirety of the sky . In particular , WASP @-@ 43 was observed first by the leg of WASP @-@ South at the South African Astronomical Observatory between January and May 2009 . 
 Later observation by both <unk> in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres led to the collection of 13 @,@ 768 data points between January and May 2010 and to the use of the CORALIE spectrograph at La Silla Observatory in Chile . Fourteen measurements using the radial velocity method confirmed WASP @-@ 43b as a planet , revealing its mass in the process . The use of La Silla 's <unk> telescope helped the science team working on the planet to create a light curve of the planet 's transit in December 2010 . 
 The planet 's discovery was published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics on April 14 , 2011 . 
 In 2014 , secondary transit of the planet was reported . Full observation of phases of the planet was reported in the September of 2014 .

 WASP @-@ 43 is a K @-@ type star in the Sextans constellation that is about 80 parsecs ( 261 light years ) away . The star has a mass of 0 @.@ 58 times that of the Sun , but is more diffuse with a radius of 0 @.@ 93 times that of the Sun . The star 's effective temperature is 4400 K , making the star cooler than the Sun , and is metal @-@ poor with regards to the Sun because it has a metallicity of [ Fe / H ] = − 0 @.@ 05 ( 89 % the amount of iron in the Sun ) .

While Hot Jupiters are known to have small orbital periods , planets with exceptionally small periods below three or four days are extremely rare ; however , in the case of WASP @-@ 43b , the planet 's proximity can be explained because its host star has a very low mass . The rarity of systems like that of WASP @-@ 43 and its planet suggest that Hot Jupiters do not usually occur around low @-@ mass stars , or that such planets cannot maintain stable orbits around such stars . 
 WASP @-@ 43b , along with the planets WASP @-@ 19b and WASP @-@ 18b , conflicted with currently accepted models of tidal movements derived from observations of the orbits of binary star systems .

 = Flag of Poland = 
 The flag of Poland consists of two horizontal stripes of equal width , the upper one white and the lower one red . The two colors are defined in the Polish constitution as the national colors . A variant of the flag with the national coat of arms in the middle of the white stripe is legally reserved for official use abroad and at sea . A similar flag with the addition of a swallow @-@ tail is used as the naval ensign of Poland . 
 White and red were officially adopted as national colors in 1831 . They are of heraldic origin and derive from the tinctures ( colors ) of the coats of arms of the two constituent nations of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth , i.e. the White Eagle of Poland and the Pursuer of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , a white knight riding a white horse , both on a red shield . Prior to that , Polish soldiers wore cockades of various color combinations . The national flag was officially adopted in 1919 . Since 2004 , Polish Flag Day is celebrated on May 2 . 
 The flag is flown continuously on the buildings of the highest national authorities , such as the parliament and the presidential palace . Other institutions and many Polish people fly the national flag on national holidays and other special occasions of national significance . Current Polish law does not restrict the use of the national flag without the coat of arms as long as the flag is not disrespected . 
 Horizontal <unk> of white and red being a relatively widespread design , there are several flags that are similar but unrelated to the Polish one . There are two national flags with the red stripe above the white one : those of Indonesia and Monaco . In Poland , many flags based on the national design also feature the national colors . 
 = = Design = = 
 = = = Legal sources = = = 
 The colors and flags of the Republic of Poland are described in two legal documents : the Constitution of the Republic of Poland of 1997 , and the Coat of Arms , Colors and Anthem of the Republic of Poland , and State Seals Act ( Ustawa o <unk> , <unk> i <unk> Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz o <unk> <unk> ) of 1980 with subsequent amendments ( henceforth referred to as " the Coat of Arms Act " ) . 
 Legislation concerning the national symbols is far from perfect . The Coat of Arms Act has been amended several times and refers extensively to executive ordinances , some of which have never been issued . Moreover , the Act contains errors , omissions and inconsistencies which make the law confusing , open to various interpretations and often not followed in practice . 
 = = = National colors = = = 
 According to Chapter I , Article 28 , paragraph 2 of the Constitution , the national colors of Poland are white and red . The Coat of Arms Act , Article 4 , further specifies that the colors are white and red in two horizontal , parallel stripes of equal width , of which the top one is white and the bottom one is red . If the colors are displayed vertically , the white stripe is placed on the left from the onlooker 's viewpoint . Attachment no . 2 to the Act shows the national colors in both horizontal and vertical alignment , as well as the official shades of both colors expressed as <unk> in the CIE <unk> ( CIE 1931 ) color space with the tolerated color differences ( ΔE ) specified in the CIE 1976 ( L * , u * , v * ) color space ( <unk> ) . 
 = = = Variants of the national flag = = = 
 The Constitution contains no mention of a national flag . Instead , the flag is defined by the Coat of Arms Act which specifies two variants of the national flag : the national flag of the Republic of Poland ( <unk> <unk> Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej ) and the national flag with coat of arms of the Republic of Poland ( <unk> <unk> z <unk> Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej ) . Both flags are defined in Article 6 of the act as follows : 
 The state flag of the Republic of Poland is a rectangular piece of cloth in the colors of the Republic of Poland hoisted on a flagpole . 
 The state flag of the Republic of Poland is also the flag specified in paragraph 1 , with the coat of arms of the Republic of Poland placed in the middle of the white stripe . 
 The hoist to fly ratio for both flags is 5 : 8 . For the latter flag , the proportion between the inescutcheon of the coat of arms and the hoist is 2 : 5 . Images of both variations of the flag can be found in attachment no . 3 to the Coat of Arms Act . 
 = = Usage = = 
 = = = Respect for the flag = = = 
 Polish law says that treating the national symbols , including the flag , " with reverence and respect " is the " right and obligation " of every Polish citizen and all state organs , institutions and organizations . Public disrespect , destruction or intentional removal of the flag is considered a crime punishable by a fine , penal servitude or up to one year of imprisonment . Official statistics show that crimes against national symbols are rare : 43 such crimes in 2003 and 96 in 2004 were less than 0 @.@ 001 % of all crimes registered in Poland in those years . Other , unspecified violation of regulations on the Polish flag is an infraction , punishable by a fine or up to one month imprisonment . 
 = = = Right and obligation to fly the flag = = = 
 According to the Coat of Arms Act , everyone can use the Polish flag , especially during national and cultural events , as long as it is done in a respectful manner . This liberty in the use of national colors is a relative novelty . Until 2004 , Polish citizens were only allowed to fly the Polish flag on national holidays . The use of both variants was restricted , but only flying the flag with coat of arms was , from 1955 until 1985 , punishable by a fine or arrest for up to one year . After 1985 , unauthorized use of any national symbols was an infraction . A possible explanation to such harsh measures was the fact that the officially @-@ promoted holiday of May 1st was separated by only one day from the pre @-@ war ( and current ) national holiday of Poland , the anniversary of signing of the Constitution of May 3 , 1791 . While hoisting a flag on May 1 was acceptable , no later than the following day it must have been hidden . 
 This restriction and kind of state monopoly on the use of national symbols during the Communist regime made flying the Polish flag a symbol of resistance against the government . It became customary – and still is – for workers to hoist Polish flags on plant buildings when going on strike . This is why the Polish flag , as a symbol of patriotism and resistance against the Communist rule , is part of the Solidarity trade union logo . 
 = = = = Flag without coat of arms = = = = 
 Organs that are required by law to fly the national flag without coat of arms either on top or in front of their official buildings are : 
 the Sejm ( lower house of parliament ) ; 
 the Senate ( upper house of parliament ) ; 
 the President of the Republic ; 
 the Council of Ministers ( cabinet ) and the President of the Council of Ministers ( Prime Minister ) ; 
 Voivodeship sejmiks ( provincial legislatures ) – only during their sessions ; 
 other state and local government organs – only on national holidays . 
 Additionally , the national flag without coat of arms is used as an ensign for inland navigation . 
 = = = = Flag with coat of arms = = = = 
 While the ban on using the flag without coat of arms has been lifted , the use of the national flag with coat of arms is still legally restricted . This flag should be only flown : 
 on or in front of Polish embassies , consulates and other representative offices and missions abroad , as well as by Polish ambassadors and consuls on their residences and vehicles ; 
 at civilian airports and heliports ( civil air ensign ) ; 
 on civilian airplanes – only during international flights ; 
 on buildings of seaport authorities ; 
 as a merchant ( civil ) ensign . 
 In practice , however , this restriction is often ignored and the two flags – with and without coat of arms – are treated as interchangeable . The variant with the coat of arms is particularly often used by the Polonia , or Polish diaspora outside Poland , especially in the United States . 
 = = = Flag flying days = = = 
 State and local government organs are legally required , and other institutions and organizations as well as all citizens are encouraged to fly the Polish flag on the following days : 
 May 1 – State Holiday ( May Day , formerly Labor Day ) ; 
 May 2 – Polish Flag Day ; 
 May 3 – Constitution Day ; 
 November 11 – Independence Day . 
 Polish Flag Day ( formally : Flag of the Republic of Poland Day , <unk> <unk> Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej ) was first observed on May 2 , 2004 . It was established in order to educate the Polish people about the history and significance of national symbols . The date was chosen to coincide with the Polonia Day traditionally observed by the Polish diaspora outside Poland and the Polish Senate on May 2 . There was also a historical reason : under the Communist regime , May 2 was a day when national flags , hoisted for Labor Day on May 1 were being quickly removed before Polish Constitution Day ( May 3 ) , which was banned by the authorities . Since the re @-@ introduction of the Constitution Day in 1990 and establishment of the Polish Flag Day , the flag is flown continuously during the first three days of May . Unlike May Day and Constitution Day , the Flag Day is not a public holiday , although making a bridge , i.e. taking a day off on that day is common practice ( see Holidays in Poland ) . 
 Other days when the Polish flag is often flown on official buildings include : 
 May 5 and May 9 – Europe Days ( together with the European flag ) ; 
 August 15 – Polish Armed Forces Day ( mostly on military premises and at tombs of the Unknown Soldier ) 
 September 27 – Polish Underground State Day . 
 The flag is also popularly flown during important sporting events , such as the FIFA World Cup , if Polish athletes are participating ; and during an official visit of a particularly important person , especially a pope , in Poland . During a pope 's visit , the national flag is usually flown together with yellow and white Church flags , and white and blue Marian flags . It is uncommon to fly the national flag on personal occasions , such as birthdays or weddings . 
 According to polls , about one out of three Poles say they own a Polish flag , and about one out of four fly it on national holidays . Such public display of patriotism is much more common in western Poland , especially in Greater Poland , than in other parts of the country . 
 = = Flag protocol = = 
 Flags in Poland are used according to a customary , rather than legal , flag protocol . Apart from the obligation to treat the flag with due respect , Polish law does not offer a detailed code of correct usage of the Polish flag . Some organizations and public institutions , such as the Heraldic and Vexillological Institute and the Supreme Chamber of Control have proposed written flag protocols for the Polish flag , based on custom , flag protocols of other countries such as India and the United States , and common sense . These guidelines , however , are not legally binding . 
 Traditionally , the national flag is reserved to serve either informative of festive purposes . A single specimen of the flag on or in front of a public office building indicates its official role . Multiple flags , on the other hand , are normally used to decorate both public and private buildings to mark special occasions , such as national holidays . 
 In Polish heraldry , the tincture of the charge has priority in relation to the tincture of the field . In the case of Polish national colors , white , the color of the White Eagle , should always be placed in a more honorable position than red , the color of the field of the Polish coat of arms . In the most usual , horizontal alignment , this means that the white stripe is placed above the red one . If the alignment is vertical , the white stripe should be on the left from the onlooker 's point of view . If the flag is hung vertically above a street , the white stripe should be placed on the left when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers . If it drapes a coffin , the white stripe should be placed over the heart . 
 The flag should be raised before 8 a.m. and lowered at sunset , and if flown at night , it should be illuminated . During a ceremonial raising of the flag , the national anthem is played so that the timing of the raising matches the duration of the anthem . Civilians pay respect by standing in a dignified manner ; additionally , men uncover their heads . Members of uniformed services stand at attention ; if their uniform includes headgear and they are not standing in an organized group , they also perform the two @-@ finger salute . Color guards dip their banners to the flag . ( See video ) 
 According to generally accepted standards of respect , the national flag should never be dipped to any person or thing . Care should be taken to prevent the flag from touching the ground , floor or water beneath it . It should be also secured from being torn off or falling to the ground and it should not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain , blizzard or very strong wind . The flag should never be flown dirty , torn or faded . When no longer in a fit condition to be used , it should be disposed of in a dignified manner , preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate the colors and then , burning . 
 When displayed with other flags , the Polish flag should be raised first and lowered last . Each flag must be flown from a separate pole of the same height , but the flag of Poland should be always placed in the most honorable position . It means that if the total number of flags is even , the Polish flag should be placed to its right of the other flags . If the total number of flags is odd , it should be placed in the middle . Alternatively , two Polish flags may be placed , one at each end of the row of flags . The order of precedence for flags is as follows : 
 flag of Poland , 
 national flags of other countries ( in alphabetical order ) , 
 voivodeship flags , 
 county flags , 
 commune flags , 
 European flag , 
 flags of domestic organizations , 
 flags of international organizations , 
 public services flags , 
 corporate flags , 
 other flags . 
 The President of the Republic may announce a period of national mourning . During that time Polish flags are flown at half @-@ staff . If a flag is flown from a wooden pole rather than a staff or mast , a black ribbon is attached to the pole as a sign of mourning or a black flag is flown to its left from the national flag . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Royal banner = = = 
 The earliest <unk> ( flag @-@ like objects ) used in Poland were known as stanice and probably resembled the Roman vexillum , that is a cloth draped vertically from a horizontal crosspiece attached to a wooden pole or spear . They served as both religious and military symbols as early as 10th century CE . With Poland 's conversion to Christianity in 966 , the stanice were probably Christianized by replacing pagan symbols with Christian ones . The royal banner of arms dates back to the reign of King Boleslaus the Generous ( r . 1076 – 1079 ) , but it was during the reign of King Vladislaus the Elbow @-@ High ( r . 1320 – 1333 ) that a red cloth emblazoned with the White Eagle of the arms of Poland was finally established as the Banner of the Kingdom of Poland , a symbol of royal authority used at coronations and in battles . 
 In the times of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth ( 1569 – 1795 ) , a banner of the Commonwealth was also used , combining the heraldic symbols of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . The Commonwealth banner was initially plain white emblazoned with the arms of the Commonwealth which consisted of the heraldic charges of Poland ( White Eagle ) and Lithuania ( Pursuer ) . Since both Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms consisted of white ( Argent ) charges in a red ( Gules ) field , these two colors started to be used for the entire banner . During the 17th century , the banner was usually divided into two , three or four horizontal , often swallow @-@ tailed , stripes of red and white . 
 = = = National cockade = = = 
 In the 18th and 19th centuries , European nations used cockades , or knots of colored ribbons pinned to the hat , to denote the nationality of their military . In Poland , until 1831 , there was no consensus as to what the colors of the national cockade should be . Polish soldiers wore white , white @-@ and @-@ red , blue @-@ and @-@ red or blue @-@ white @-@ red cockades . 
 The custom came to Poland from Saxony during the reign of Augustus II ( r . 1697 – 1733 ) , King of Poland and Elector of Saxony . During that time , the cockade worn by the Polish military had , like in Saxony , the form of a white silk ribbon with a knot in the middle . It was later replaced with a circular white cockade wrinkled toward the center , patterned after the cockade of the Kingdom of France . During the reign of King Stanislaus Augustus ( r . 1764 – 1795 ) , a white @-@ and @-@ red cockade came into use alongside the plain white one . In 1791 , the Military Commission introduced a metal cross pattée as a more durable alternative to the cockade . However , many soldiers continued to either pin the cross to the cockade or wear the cockade without the cross . Polish military leaders and national heroes of the time , such as General Tadeusz Kościuszko and Prince Józef Poniatowski pinned plain white " national " cockades to their hats . 
 The patriotic and staunchly Catholic members of the Bar Confederation of 1768 – 1772 adopted crimson – the symbol of Polish szlachta , or nobility – and blue – symbolizing Virgin Mary – as their colors . These , as well as white @-@ and @-@ red , were considered national colors during the Great Sejm of 1788 – 1792 . White and red were first publicly used as national colors by civilians on May 3 , 1792 in Warsaw , during a celebration of the first anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of 1791 . Meanwhile , the political left wore the blue @-@ white @-@ red cockades of the French Revolution . Polish Legions created in 1797 in French @-@ controlled republics in Italy , used either national cockades of the particular Italian republics in which they served or the French tricolor cockade . In the latter case , the red and blue colors were replaced with crimson and navy blue respectively , hues considered to be traditionally Polish . The General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland , which sought to revive the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth during the French invasion of Russia in 1812 , adopted red @-@ and @-@ blue cockades , symbolizing the unity of Poland ( red ) and Lithuania ( blue ) . The military of the French @-@ controlled Duchy of Warsaw ( 1807 – 1815 ) and the Russian @-@ controlled Congress Kingdom of Poland ( 1815 – 1831 ) used the white cockade , which was also worn by the cadets who started the November Uprising against Russian rule on November 29 , 1830 . 
 During the uprising , the Sejm realized the need for unified national insignia that could be used by the Polish military . On February 7 , 1831 it adopted white and red , the tinctures ( colors ) of the Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms , as the national cockade of Poland . The white @-@ and @-@ red cockade was henceforth worn by Polish soldiers in the November Uprising , as well as by participants of the Kraków Uprising of 1846 , Polish freedom fighters in the Grand Duchy of Posen and the Austrian Empire during the Spring of Nations of 1848 , and Polish insurgents during the January Uprising of 1863 – 1864 . White and red colors were also used by civilians to show their protest against the Russian rule , as well as by people in France , Britain , Germany , Belgium and other countries as a sign of their sympathy with the Polish cause . The Sejm 's decision was not , however , immediately accepted by all . Left @-@ wing politicians of the time , such as Joachim Lelewel , continued to regard the revolutionary blue , white and red as true national colors . Tricolor standards were used by some Polish guerrilla units during the January Uprising . 
 = = = Twentieth century = = = 
 White @-@ and @-@ red flags were first waved during a patriotic demonstration on May 3 , 1916 in Warsaw . The organizing committee advised participants about the correct alignment of the colors , that is with the white stripe above the red one . Still , many demonstrators brought flags with the red stripe on top . On August 1 , 1919 , almost a year after Poland regained independence in November 1918 , the Sejm officially introduced a white @-@ and @-@ red bicolor as the Polish national flag . In order to avoid confusion with the white @-@ and @-@ red maritime signal flag used internationally by harbor pilots and tugboats , the same act of Sejm introduced a variant of the flag with the coat of arms in the white stripe for use as a civil ensign and by Polish diplomats and consuls abroad . 
 Apart from changes in the legal specifications of the shades of the national colors ( see the section below ) , the basic design of the Polish flag , including the 5 : 8 ratio , has remained unchanged to this day . The flag with coat of arms was only modified to adjust to the changes in the coat of arms itself . Major modifications included a change in the stylization of the eagle from Classicist to Baroque in 1927 and the removal of the crown from the eagle 's head during the Communist rule from 1944 to 1990 . 
 20th @-@ century Polish insurgents wore white @-@ and @-@ red <unk> ( armbands ) which played a role similar to the cockade of previous centuries . Such armbands were worn by Polish freedom fighters during the Greater Poland Uprising ( 1918 – 1919 ) and Silesian Uprisings ( 1919 – 1921 ) , as well as during the Second World War ( 1939 – 1945 ) by the soldiers of the Home Army ( AK ) and Peasants ' Battalions ( <unk> ) – usually emblazoned with the acronyms of their formations . During the Second World War , Polish soldiers raised the Polish flag on several sites of their victories . On May 18 , 1944 , after an Allied victory over the German forces in the Battle of Monte Cassino , a patrol of the 12th <unk> Uhlan Regiment ( part of the Polish 3rd Carpathian Rifle Division ) raised a Polish flag on ruins of the Monte Cassino abbey in Italy . On August 1 , 1944 , the first day of the Warsaw Uprising , a white @-@ and @-@ red flag was hoisted on the Prudential building , Warsaw 's tallest skyscraper of the time . During the liberation of Warsaw by Soviet forces and Polish People 's Army on January 17 , 1945 , Polish flags were raised on the Belvedere palace and ruins of the Main Railway Station . On May 2 , 1945 , after the capture of Berlin , soldiers of the 7th Battery , 3rd Division , 1st Light Artillery Regiment planted Polish flags on the Berlin Victory Column . 
 Polish flags were also used by anti @-@ government demonstrators under the Communist rule . During the bloody riots of 1956 in Poznań and 1970 in Gdynia , protesters carried flags that were blood @-@ stained on the white stripe . 
 = = = Shades of red = = = 
 Until 1927 , the exact shades of the national colors were not legally specified . In practice , the actual hue , particularly of red , depended on what kind of red dye was available . In pre @-@ partition Poland , crimson , due to its high price , was a color associated with the rich and the privileged . It could be obtained from the domestically harvested Polish cochineal , although imported alternatives were also available : kermes from the Mediterranean Basin ( hence <unk> , the Polish name of the color ) and Mexican cochineal after the discovery of the New World . Crimson was reserved for the nobility and considered a symbol of the aristocracy , so that <unk> became synonymous with a magnate . A royal ban on wearing this color could be a form of punishment ; in the 14th century , the <unk> clan of Greater Poland were forbidden to dress in crimson for their ancestors ' complicity in the assassination of King Premislaus in 1296 . In the first half of the 19th century , due to the influence of French fashion , crimson was largely replaced with the cheaper amaranth . 
 The National Cockade Act of 1831 did not specify the shade of red , for which it was criticized by Joachim Lelewel , nor did the Coat of Arms and National Colors Act of 1919 . In 1921 , the Ministry of Military Affairs issued a pamphlet with illustrations of the Polish flag and other national symbols which used the crimson shade of red . The pamphlet was not , however , an official source of law and was published for informative purpose only . The shade of red was first legally specified by a presidential decree of December 13 , 1927 which stipulated that the official shade was vermilion . This specification was upheld by a decree of December 7 , 1955 .

 The flag of the Grand Duchy of Posen , a Polish @-@ populated autonomous province of the Kingdom of Prussia created in 1815 , was a red @-@ and @-@ white horizontal bicolor . Its colors were taken from the duchy 's coat of arms which consisted of the Prussian Black Eagle with an inescutcheon of the Polish White Eagle . With Germany 's increasingly anti @-@ Polish policy and a rising identification of white and red as Polish national colors , the red @-@ and @-@ white flag of Posen was replaced in 1886 with a white @-@ black @-@ white horizontal triband . No other part of Poland during the time of Partitions used a flag that would incorporate Polish national colors . 
 Today , many flags used in Poland are based on the design of the national flag . This applies especially to flags defined by Polish law and used by the Polish military and other uniformed services , such as the naval ensign – a swallow @-@ tailed horizontal bicolor of white and red defaced with the arms of Poland in the white stripe . Flags of some administrative subdivisions also resemble the national flag . Examples include the former flag of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship – a horizontal bicolor of white and red defaced with the arms of the voivodeship – or the flag of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship – a horizontal tricolor of white , yellow and red with the yellow stripe half as wide as any of the other two . 
 Due to the horizontal bicolor being a relatively simple and widespread flag design , and white and red being the most popular colors used on flags , there are many flags worldwide that are similar or near identical to the flag of Poland despite being unrelated to it . For example , the historical flag of Bohemia , the major historical region of Poland 's southern neighbor , the Czech Republic , consists of two horizontal stripes , white on top and red on bottom . Similarly to the flag of Poland , it is of heraldic origin , the coat of arms of Bohemia being Gules , a lion rampant , queue <unk> Argent , crowned , langued and armed Or , that is a silver double @-@ tailed lion in a red field . The white @-@ and @-@ red Bohemian flag came into use when Bohemia was a province of Austria @-@ Hungary and , after the end of the First World War in 1918 , it was shortly used as a flag of the newly formed Czecho @-@ Slovak Republic . In 1920 , in order to avoid confusion with the Polish flag , a blue triangle was added to create a flag used by Czechoslovakia until its dissolution in 1993 and currently used as the flag of the Czech Republic . 
 Other examples of flags that could be confused with the Polish one include the civil flags of the following regions : Cantabria , Spain ; Kranj , Slovenia ; Thuringia , Germany ; Upper Austria and Tyrol , Austria ; as well the city of Honda , Colombia . Furthermore , the Dutch city of Maastricht used a similar design between 1938 @-@ 1994 but <unk> its old flag to avoid confusion . There are currently two independent states – Indonesia and Monaco – whose national flags are horizontal <unk> of red and white , reversing the Polish flag . The Monaco and Indonesia flags differ in proportions and shades of the colors ( see Flag of Indonesia and Flag of Monaco ) . 
 = Archimyrmex = 
 Archimyrmex is an extinct genus of ant in the <unk> subfamily Myrmeciinae , described by palaeoentomologist Theodore Cockerell in 1923 . The genus contains four described species , Archimyrmex rostratus , Archimyrmex piatnitzkyi , Archimyrmex smekali and Archimyrmex wedmannae . Archimyrmex is known from a group of Middle Eocene fossils which were found in North America , South America , and Europe . The genus was initially placed in the subfamily Ponerinae , but it was later placed in Myrmeciinae ; it is now believed to be the ancestor of the extant primitive genus Myrmecia from Australia . Despite this , Archimyrmex is not a member to any tribe and is regarded as incertae sedis within Myrmeciinae . However , some authors believe Archimyrmex should be assigned as incertae sedis within Formicidae . These ants can be characterised by their large mandibles and body length , ranging from 13 @.@ 2 to 30 mm ( 0 @.@ 52 to 1 @.@ 18 in ) . They also have long , thin legs and an elongated mesosoma ( thorax ) and petiole . 
 = = History and classification = = 
 When described the genus Archimyrmex was known from a solitary fossil preserved as an impression in fine shale of the Green River formation in Colorado . The fossil was recovered in July 1922 from the " station 1 " fossil site near the top of the Ute trail by entomologist <unk> Porter Cockerell . One side of the A. rostratus holotype is currently deposited in the University of Colorado paleontology collections while the counterpart is in the US National Museum , and an additional eleven fossils were known as of 2002 . The holotype was first studied by palaeoentomologist Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell of the University of Colorado and his 1923 type description of the new genus and species was published in The Entomologist . The specific epithet " rostratus " is a reference to the beak @-@ like outline of the mandibles seen in the type specimen . 
 Cockerell placed the genus into the subfamily Ponerinae . He noted similarities between Archimyrmex and Myrmecia and Prionomyrmex , suggesting Archimyrmex to be an intermediate between the two other genera . The genus was re @-@ described in 1928 by palaeoentomologist William Wheeler who moved the genus from Ponerinae to Myrmicinae . This placement was not challenged until a 2003 paper by Russian palaeoentomologists G.M. Dlussky and K.S. Perfilieva , who moved the genus again , this time to the primitive Subfamily Myrmeciinae based on the close similarity between Archimyrmex and Prionomyrmex . In 1957 , an additional species of fossil ant was described from the Middle Eocene Ventana Formation in the Rio <unk> region of Argentina by M.J. Viana and J.A. Haedo Rossi . They placed the species into a new genus , Ameghinoia as Ameghinoia " piatnitzkyi . As with Archimyrmex , the genus was first placed in Ponerinae . It was subsequently moved to Myrmeciinae by R.R. Snelling in 1981 . A second Ventana Formation ant species was described in 1981 by E. Rossi de Garcia and placed into another new genus <unk> as P. smekali . Recovered from an outcrop of the Ventana Formation in the Rio <unk> area , Rossi de Garcia distinguished the new species from " A. " piatnitzkyi based on characteristics of the wing venation and because of the difference in size of the two type specimens . A series of fossils from the three genera were examined by Dlussky and Perfilieva and based on the very notable similarities between the three species , they synonymized the three genera under Archimyrmex , treating both Ameghinoia and " <unk> " as junior synonyms . A fourth species , A. wedmannae was described by Dlussky in 2012 based on fossils found in the Middle Eocene Messel Pit site of Germany . The specific epithet was chosen by Dlussky to honour <unk> Sonja <unk> . 
 Before Archimyrmex was placed into the subfamily Myrmeciinae , Wheeler classified the genus as incertae sedis ( Latin for " of uncertain placement " ) within the ant subfamily Myrmicinae , as it could not be confidently placed into any ant tribe . Even after its placement within Myrmeciinae it was still classified as incertae sedis . However , Cesare Baroni Urbani of the University of Basel , Switzerland classified the genus as incertae sedis within the family Formicidae . Baroni Urbani justifies his decision by stating the characters of the ant are similar to those of <unk> , an insect from the Lower Cretaceous that was once placed in Myrmeciinae , but is now incertae sedis within the subclade <unk> . Archimyrmex also shares a similar structure to other ants and insects within the order Hymenoptera . The key diagnostic traits ( synapomorphies ) of Myrmeciinae ants cannot be observed although the described species have elongated scapes ( the first segment of the antenna ) , a key diagnostic trait for Formicidae . A 2012 report describing new <unk> fossils accepted the classification of Archibald and colleagues while disregarding Baroni Urbani 's comments . 
 The following cladogram generated by Archibald and colleagues show the possible phylogenetic position of Archimyrmex among some ants of the subfamily Myrmeciinae ; it is possible that Archimyrmex may be the ancestor of Myrmecia . 
 = = Description = = 
 In general Archimyrmex individuals have a head capsule that bears a set of enlarged | mandibles with either a rectangular or triangular outline . The mandibles have a mixed arrangement of teeth and denticles ( smaller teeth ) on the inside margin . The gynes have long legs and long <unk> , an elongated petiole ( a narrow waist between the mesosoma and gaster ) which is usually smooth in profile on the upper surface . The petiole structure in combination with little to no constriction between abdominal segments III and IV is unique to the genus and separates it from the other Myrmeciinae genera . 
 = = = A. piatnitzkyi = = = 
 A. piatnitzkyi is reported from three specimens , giving a body length between 16 – 18 mm ( 0 @.@ 63 – 0 @.@ 71 in ) . The holotype is currently preserved at the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum <unk> collection . The head capsule is slightly ovoid , being a little longer than it is wide and having elongated mandibles that are notably shorter than the head . As with A. smekali , the mesosoma is massive , being between 1 @.@ 7 @-@ 1 @.@ 8 times as long as it is tall . The legs are like those of the other species , being long and thin . Unlike the other species , the petiole of A. piatnitzkyi does not have a constricted post @-@ petiole . 
 = = = A. rostratus = = = 
 The type specimen numbers are UC no . <unk> and USNM no . <unk> for the part and counterpart ; females of the type species A. rostratus have a body length estimated to be between 13 @.@ 2 – 15 @.@ 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 52 – 0 @.@ 62 in ) , with a small gaster that is shorter than the mesosoma and sporting a short thick sting . The length of the head when excluding the mandibles is 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 16 in ) , the mesosoma is 5 @.@ 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 21 in ) and the middle femur is around 3 @.@ 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 15 in ) . The preserved specimens are brown and the upper area of the head and gaster is black , which is similar to Myrmecia nigriceps . The head capsules have antennae borne on a scape which is long and passes the edge of the occipital margin of the head . The short , thickened mandibles have several larger teeth interspersed with small denticles , and are about 50 % of the length of the head capsule . The scape is believed to be long and thin , and its mesosoma is narrow and long . The width of the scutum is greater than its length , the legs are noticeably elongated and thin , and the <unk> ( a narrow stalk that connects the mesosoma with the abdomen ) is slightly convex . 
 = = = A. smekali = = = 
 The A. smekali lectotype numbered <unk> no . 1972 / 1574 / 9 is housed in the Museum of Natural History . The lectotype female has an estimated body length of 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) with an mesosoma that is described as " relatively massive " ( being only 1 @.@ 7 @-@ 1 @.@ 9 times as long as tall ) and an oval shaped gaster . There is a notable constriction in the post @-@ petiole abdominal segment not seen in the other species . The head capsule has mandibles which are about 70 % as long as the head capsule , and have four to five large teeth each . The antennal scape is longer than the occipital margin and the antenna is composed of an estimated twelve segments . The legs are elongated and narrow , the propodeum is weakly convex and the petiole does not have a node ( a segment between the mesosoma and gaster ) . A. smekali can be distinguished from other species by its massive size , the constriction in the post @-@ petiole and the absence of the node . It was previously thought the ant had an eight @-@ segmented antennae , but the lectotype has seven segments ; Dlussky also mentions that the original description provided by Elsa Rossi de Garcia does not match the description he provided . 
 = = = A. wedmannae = = = 
 A. wedmannae from Germany is described from a single gyne that is approximately 23 mm ( 0 @.@ 91 in ) , found in the Messel pit . The fossil is believed to be 47 million years old . The mesosoma measures 7 @.@ 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 29 in ) , the length of the head is 2 @.@ 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 11 in ) , the scape is 3 @.@ 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 13 in ) , the diameter of the eyes are 1 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 047 in ) and the forewings are 10 @.@ 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 42 in ) . The species has a head which is shorter than it is wide , but has mandibles about as long as the head which are triangular in outline . The eyes are oval shaped . As with the three other species the antennal scape is long , one @-@ third of the scape length protrudes past the occipital margin of the head . The pronotum in profile is either straight or weakly concave , and the petiole is weakly rounded with no node present . The propodeum has small denticles and is weakly convex , and the legs are long . The gaster has a well developed and long sting . This species can be distinguished from other Archimyrmex ants by its long mandibles ; the shape of the petiole is almost the same as A. smekali , but their mandibles are much shorter and the mesosoma is more compact . The propodeum 's dorsal surface is also more convex . 
 = Kīlauea = 
 Kīlauea ( English / <unk> / KEE @-@ low @-@ AY @-@ ə , also US / <unk> / <unk> @-@ ə @-@ WAY @-@ ə ; Hawaiian : [ <unk> ] ) is a currently active shield volcano in the Hawaiian Islands , and the most active of the five volcanoes that together form the island of Hawaiʻi . Located along the southern shore of the island , the volcano is between 300 @,@ 000 and 600 @,@ 000 years old and emerged above sea level about 100 @,@ 000 years ago . It is the second youngest product of the Hawaiian hotspot and the current eruptive center of the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain . Because it lacks topographic prominence and its activities historically coincided with those of Mauna Loa , Kīlauea was once thought to be a satellite of its much larger neighbor . Structurally , Kīlauea has a large , fairly recently formed caldera at its summit and two active rift zones , one extending 125 km ( 78 mi ) east and the other 35 km ( 22 mi ) west , as an active fault of unknown depth moving vertically an average of 2 to 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 1 to 0 @.@ 8 in ) per year . 
 Kīlauea 's eruptive history has been a long and active one ; its name means " spewing " or " much spreading " in the Hawaiian language , referring to its frequent outpouring of lava . The earliest lavas from the volcano date back to its submarine preshield stage , samples having been recovered by remotely operated underwater vehicles from its submerged slopes ; samples of other flows have been recovered as core samples . Lavas younger than 1 @,@ 000 years cover 90 percent of the volcano 's surface . The oldest exposed lavas date back 2 @,@ 800 years . The first well @-@ documented eruption of Kīlauea occurred in 1823 ( Western contact and written history began in 1778 ) , and since that time the volcano has erupted repeatedly . Most historical eruptions have occurred at the volcano 's summit or its eastern rift zone , and are prolonged and effusive in character . The geological record shows , however , that violent explosive activity predating European contact was extremely common , and in 1790 one such eruption killed over 80 warriors ; should explosive activity start anew the volcano would become much more of a danger to humans . Kīlauea 's current eruption dates back to January 3 , 1983 , and is by far its longest @-@ duration historical period of activity , as well as one of the longest @-@ duration eruptions in the world ; as of January 2011 , the eruption has produced 3 @.@ 5 km3 ( 1 cu mi ) of lava and resurfaced 123 @.@ 2 km2 ( 48 sq mi ) of land . 
 Kīlauea 's high state of activity has a major impact on its mountainside ecology where plant growth is often interrupted by fresh tephra and drifting volcanic sulfur dioxide , producing acid rains particularly in a barren area south of its southwestern rift zone known as the <unk> Desert . Nonetheless , wildlife flourishes where left undisturbed elsewhere on the volcano and is highly endemic thanks to Kīlauea 's ( and the island of Hawaiʻi 's ) isolation from the nearest landmass . Historically , the five volcanoes on the island were considered sacred by the Hawaiian people , and in Hawaiian mythology Kīlauea 's Halemaumau Crater served as the body and home of Pele , goddess of fire , lightning , wind , and volcanoes . William Ellis , a missionary from England , gave the first modern account of Kīlauea and spent two weeks traveling along the volcano ; since its foundation by Thomas Jaggar in 1912 , the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory , located on the rim of Kīlauea caldera , has served as the principal investigative and scientific body on the volcano and the island in general . In 1916 a bill forming the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson ; since then the park has become a World Heritage Site and a major tourist destination , attracting roughly 2 @.@ 6 million people annually . 
 = = Geology = = 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 Like all Hawaiian volcanoes , Kīlauea was created as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth 's underlying mantle . The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that , over 70 million years , has created the 6 @,@ 000 km ( 3 @,@ 700 mi ) -long Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain . The prevailing , though not completely settled , view is that the hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet 's mantle for much , if not all of the Cenozoic Era . However , while the Hawaiian mantle plume is well @-@ understood and extensively studied , the nature of hotspots themselves remains fairly enigmatic . 
 Kīlauea is one of five subaerial volcanoes that make up the island of Hawaiʻi , created by the Hawaii hotspot . The oldest volcano on the island , Kohala , is more than a million years old , and Kīlauea , the youngest , is believed to be between 300 @,@ 000 and 600 @,@ 000 years of age ; Lōʻihi Seamount on the island 's flank is even younger , but has yet to breach the surface . Thus it is the second youngest volcano in the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain , a chain of shield volcanoes and seamounts extending from Hawaii to the Kuril – Kamchatka Trench in Russia . 
 Following the pattern of Hawaiian volcano formation , Kīlauea started as a submarine volcano , gradually building itself up through underwater eruptions of alkali basalt lava before emerging from the sea with a series of explosive eruptions about 50 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 years ago . Since then , the volcano 's activity has likely been as it is now , a continual stream of effusive and explosive eruptions of roughly the same pattern as its activity in the last 200 or 300 years . 
 At most 600 @,@ 000 years old , Kīlauea is still quite young for a Hawaiian volcano ; the oldest volcano on the island , the northwestern Kohala , experienced almost 900 @,@ 000 years of activity before going extinct . The volcano 's foreseeable future activity will likely be much like it has been for the past 50 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 years ; Hawaiian and explosive activity will continue to heighten Kīlauea 's summit , build up its rift zones , and fill and refill its summit caldera . 
 = = = Structure = = = 
 Kīlauea has been active throughout its history . Since 1918 , Kīlauea 's only prolonged period of rest was an 18 @-@ year pause between 1934 and 1952 . The bulk of Kīlauea consists of solidified lava flows , intermittent with scattered volcanic ash and tephra sourced from relatively lower @-@ volume explosive eruptions . Much of the volcano is covered in historical flows , and 90 percent of its surface dates from the last 1 @,@ 100 years . Kīlauea built itself up from the seafloor over time , and thus much of its bulk remains underwater ; its subaerial surface is in the form of a gently sloping , elongate , decentralized shield with a surface area of approximately 1 @,@ 500 km2 ( 579 sq mi ) , making up 13 @.@ 7 percent of the island 's total surface area . 
 Kīlauea lacks a topographical prominence , appearing only as a bulge on the southeastern flank of the nearby Mauna Loa ; because of this , both native Hawaiians and early geologists considered it an active satellite of its more massive neighbor . However , analysis of the chemical composition of lavas from the two volcanoes shows that they have separate magma chambers , and are thus distinct . Nonetheless , their proximity has led to a historical trend in which high activity at one volcano roughly coincides with low activity at the other . When Kīlauea lay dormant between 1934 and 1952 , Mauna Loa became active , and when the latter remained quiet from 1952 to 1974 , the reverse was true . This is not always the case ; the 1984 eruption of Mauna Loa started during an eruption at Kīlauea , but had no discernible effect on the Kīlauea eruption , and the ongoing inflation of Mauna Loa 's summit , indicative of a future eruption , began the same day as new lava flows at Kīlauea 's Puʻu ʻŌʻō crater . Geologists have suggested that " pulses " of magma entering Mauna Loa 's deeper magma system may have increased pressure inside Kīlauea and triggered the concurrent eruptions . 
 Kīlauea has a large summit caldera , measuring 4 by 3 @.@ 2 km ( 2 by 2 mi ) with walls up to 120 m ( 400 ft ) high , breached by lava flows on the southwestern side . It is unknown if the caldera was always there or if it is a relatively recent feature , and it is possible that it has come and gone throughout Kīlauea 's eruptive history ; what is known is that it likely formed over several centuries , with its construction estimated to have begun about 500 years ago , and that its present form was finalized by a particularly powerful eruption in 1790 . A major feature within the caldera is Halemaʻumaʻu Crater , a large pit crater and one of Kīlauea 's most historically active eruption centers . The crater is approximately 920 m ( 3 @,@ 018 ft ) in diameter and 85 m ( 279 ft ) deep , but its form has varied widely through its eruptive history ; the floor of the Halemaʻumaʻu Crater is now mostly covered by flows from its most recent eruption , in 1974 . 
 Kīlauea has two rift zones radiating from its summit , one leading 125 km ( 78 mi ) out to the east , the other 35 km ( 22 mi ) long and trending towards the southwest . Tectonic extension along both rift zones is causing Kīlauea 's bulk to slowly slide seaward off its southern flank at a rate of about 6 to 10 cm ( 2 to 4 in ) per year , centered on a basal <unk> fault 7 to 9 km ( 4 to 6 mi ) beneath the volcano 's surface . The eastern rift zone in particular is a dominant feature on the volcano ; it is almost entirely covered in lava erupted in the last 400 years , and at its crest near the summit is 2 to 4 km ( 1 to 2 mi ) wide . Non @-@ localized eruptions , typical of rift zone activity , have produced a series of low @-@ lying ridges down the majority of the east rift zone 's length . Its upper segment is the most presently active section of the volcano , and is additionally the site of a number of large pit craters ; its lower extremity reaches down Kīlauea 's submerged flank to a depth of more than 5 @,@ 000 m ( 16 @,@ 400 ft ) . By contrast , the much smaller southwestern rift has been quiet since a rifting episode in 1974 , and to date has not been involved in the current eruptive cycle at all . The southwestern rift zone 's extremity is also underwater , although its submarine length is more limited . The southwestern rift zone also lacks a well @-@ defined ridge line or a large number of pit craters , evidence that it is also geologically less active than the eastern rift zone . 
 A prominent structure on Kīlauea 's southern flank is the Hilina fault system , a highly active fault moving vertically an average of 2 to 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 1 to 0 @.@ 8 in ) per year along the system . Its physiographic province is 500 m ( 1 @,@ 640 ft ) deep , but it is unknown if it is a shallow <unk> fault or if it penetrates to the very base of the volcano . A number of cinder cones , satellite shields , lava tubes , and other eruptive structures also dot the volcano , evidence of its recent activity . Kīlauea has some interactions with Mauna Loa , its larger neighbor and only other recently active volcano on the island ; interspersed lava flows and ash deposits belonging to its neighbor have been found on its flanks , and some of Mauna Loa 's flows are , in turn , blanketed in Kīlauea tephra . In particular , the saddle between the two volcanoes is currently depressed , and is likely to fill over in the future . 
 All historical eruptions at Kīlauea have occurred at one of three places : its summit caldera , its eastern rift zone , or its southwestern rift zone . Half of Kīlauea 's historical eruptions have occurred at or near Kīlauea 's summit caldera . Activity there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century , capped by a massive explosive eruption in 1924 before petering out by 1934 . Recent activity has mostly shifted to Kīlauea 's eastern rift zone , the site of 24 historical eruptions , located mostly on its upper section ; by contrast , the volcano 's southwestern rift zone has been relatively quiet , and has only been the site of five events to date . 
 = = Eruptive history = = 
 = = = Prehistoric eruptions = = = 
 Geologists have dated and documented dozens of major eruptions over the volcano 's long history , bridging the long gap between Kīlauea 's oldest known rock and only extremely recent written records and historical observation . Historical lava flows from the volcano are generally recovered by scientists in one of three ways . The oldest flows , dating back 275 @,@ 000 to 225 @,@ 000 years , have been recovered from Kīlauea 's submerged southern slope by ship @-@ towed remotely operated vehicles . These lavas exhibit forms characteristic of early , submerged preshield @-@ stage eruptive episodes , from when the volcano was still a rising seamount that had not yet breached the ocean surface , and their surface exposure is unusual , as in most other volcanoes such lavas would have since been buried by more recent flows . 
 The second method of recovering older rock is through the drilling of deep core samples ; however , the cores have proved difficult to date , and several samples from depths of around 1 @,@ 700 m ( 5 @,@ 600 ft ) that suggested dates as old as 450 @,@ 000 years have since been found erroneous . More reliable paleomagnetic dating , limited to rocks dating from after Kīlauea 's emergence from the sea , has suggested ages of around 50 @,@ 000 years . Exposed flows above sea level have proved far younger . Some of the oldest reliably dated rock , 43 @,@ 000 years old , comes from charcoal sandwiched beneath an ash layer on a fault scarp known as Hilina Pali ; however , sampled dated from higher up the scarp indicate ash deposition at an average rate of 6 m ( 20 ft ) per thousand years , indicating the oldest exposed flows , from the base of the feature , could date back as far as 70 @,@ 000 years . This date is similar to that of the oldest dated extant lava flow , a southwestern rift zone flow with an uncorrected radiocarbon dating of approximately <unk> BC . 
 The oldest well @-@ studied eruptive product from Kīlauea is the <unk> Ash Member , the product of explosive eruptions between 2 @,@ 800 and 2 @,@ 100 years ago . Although it has since been largely buried by younger flows , it remains exposed in some places , and has been traced more than 20 km ( 12 mi ) from the volcano 's caldera , evidence of very powerful eruptions . Evidence suggests the existence of an active eruptive center at this time , termed the Powers Caldera , 2 km ( 1 mi ) away from the modern one . At least 1 @,@ 200 years ago , lava from the Powers Caldera overtopped its rim and solidified the structure ; this was followed by a period of very voluminous tube @-@ fed pāhoehoe flows from the summit . Following cessation of activity around 400 years ago , eruptions re @-@ centered on the eastern part of Kīlauea 's summit , and concurrently activity increased at the northern end of the eastern rift zone . 
 = = = 1790 to 1934 = = = 
 The earliest reliable written records of historical activity date back to about 1820 , and the first well @-@ documented eruption occurred in 1823 , when the volcano was first put under observation ; although Native Hawaiians are thought to have first settled on the island around 1 @,@ 500 years ago , oral records predating European arrival on the island are few and difficult to interpret . One pre @-@ contact eruption in particular , a phreatomagmatic event in 1790 , was responsible for the death of a party of warriors , part of the army of <unk> <unk> , the last island chief to resist Kamehameha I 's rule ; their death is evidenced by a set of footprints preserved within the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Kilauea has been the site of 61 separate eruptions since 1823 , easily making it one of the most active volcanoes on Earth . 
 During its observed history , the volume of lava erupted by Kīlauea has varied widely . In 1823 Kīlauea 's summit caldera was far deeper than it is today , but was in the process of filling up under nearly continuous summit eruption , with 3 km3 ( 1 cu mi ) of lava erupted there alone by 1840 . The period between 1840 and 1920 saw approximately half that in eruptive volume , and in the thirty years between then and about 1950 , the volcano was unusually quiet and exhibited very little activity ; Kīlauea 's eruptive volume has increased steadily since then , with present activity comparable to that of the early 1800s . 
 The length and origin these eruptions has also varied . Events last anywhere between days and years , and occur at a number of different sites . Half of all eruptions occur at or near Kīlauea 's summit caldera . Activity there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century , and after a reprieve between 1894 and 1907 , continued onwards until 1924 . There have been five historical eruptions at the volcano 's relatively southwestern rift zone , and 24 along its more active eastern rift zone , mostly along its upper section . 
 The volcano 's observed history has mostly been one of effusive eruptions ; however , this is a relatively recent occurrence . Prior to the arrival of the first Europeans on the island , Kīlauea was the site of regular explosive activity , evidenced then by tribal chants referencing the volcano 's fickle nature , and today by geological records of an explosively active mode of past activity . Although explosive activity still occurs at the volcano , it is not as intense as it once was , and the volcano would become much more dangerous to the general public if it returned to its old phase of activity once more . 
 Kīlauea erupted in 1823 and 1832 , but the first major eruption since the 1790 event occurred in 1840 , when its eastern rift zone became the site a large , effusive Hawaiian eruption over 35 km ( 22 mi ) of its length , unusually long even for a rift eruption . The eruption lasted for 26 days and produced an estimated 205 to 265 million cubic meters of lava ; the light created by the event was so intense that one could reportedly read a newspaper in Hilo at night , 30 km ( 19 mi ) away . 
 The volcano was active again in 1868 , 1877 , 1884 , 1885 , 1894 , and 1918 , before its next major eruption in 1918 – 1919 . Halemaʻumaʻu , then a small upwelling in the caldera floor , was topped by a lava lake that then drained , before refilling again , forming an enormous lava lake and nearly reaching the top edge of the caldera before draining once more . This activity eventually gave way to the construction of Mauna Iki , building up the large lava shield within the caldera over a period of eight months . The eruption also featured concurrent rift activity and a large amount of lava fountaining . 
 Activity in 1921 – 1923 followed . The next major eruption occurred in 1924 . Halemaʻumaʻu Crater , a fully formed pit crater after the 1919 event and the site of a sizable lava lake , first drained , then quickly began sinking into the ground , deepening to nearly 210 m ( 689 ft ) beneath a thick cloud of volcanic ash . Explosive activity began on May 10 of that year , blowing rock chunks weighing as much as 45 kg ( 99 lb ) 60 m ( 197 ft ) out , and smaller fragments weighing about 9 kg ( 20 lb ) out as far as 270 m ( 886 ft ) , and , after a brief reprieve , intensified through a major blast on May 18 , when an enormous explosive event caused the eruption 's only fatality . The eruption continued and formed numerous eruption columns up to and beyond 9 km ( 6 mi ) in height , before slowly petering down and ending by May 28 . Volcanic activity was soon confined to the summit , and ceased completely after 1934 .

 After the Halemaʻumaʻu event , Kīlauea remained relatively quiet , and , for a time , completely silent , with all activity confined to the summit . It came alive again in 1952 with an enormous lava fountain 245 m ( 804 ft ) high at the Halemaʻumaʻu Crater . Multiple continuous lava fountains between 15 and 30 m ( 49 and 98 ft ) persisted , and the eruption lasted 136 days . Eruptions occurred soon after in 1954 , 1955 , and 1959 , capped by a large event in 1960 , when fissure @-@ based phreatic eruption and earthquake activity gave way to a massive a 'a flow that overran multiple evacuated communities and resorts ; the resulting summit deflation eventually caused the ever @-@ active Halemaʻumaʻu to collapse even further . 
 Following the event , eruptive events yearly and nearly continuous , a state of activity that remains today . 1967 – 1968 saw a particularly large , 80 @-@ million @-@ cubic @-@ meter , 251 @-@ day event from Halemaʻumaʻu Crater . This event was superseded the very next year by the marathon Mauna Ulu eruption , a large effusive eruption which lasted from May 24 , 1969 to July 24 , 1974 and added 230 acres ( 93 ha ) of new land to the island . After eruptive activity had died down , there was a magnitude 7 @.@ 2 earthquake that caused a partial summit collapse , after which activity did not resume at Kīlauea until 1977 . 
 The Mauna Ulu eruption of Kīlauea began on May 24 , 1969 , and ended on July 22 , 1974 . At the time , Mauna Ulu was the longest flank eruption of any Hawaiian volcano in recorded history . The eruption created a new vent , covered a large area of land with lava , and added new land to the island . The eruption started as a fissure between two pit craters , <unk> and <unk> , where the Mauna Ulu shield would eventually form . Both pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā lava erupted from the volcano . Early on , fountains of lava burst out as much as 540 meters ( 1772 ft ) high . In early 1973 , an earthquake occurred that caused Kīlauea to briefly stop erupting near the original Mauna Ulu site and instead erupt near the craters Pauahi and Hiʻiaka . 
 = = = 1983 - present = = = 
 The most recent major eruption at Kīlauea has also proved to be by far its eruption of longest @-@ known duration . The current Kīlauea eruption began on January 3 , 1983 , along the eastern rift zone . The vent produced vigorous lava fountains that quickly built up into Puʻu ʻŌʻō cone , sending lava flows down the volcano 's slope . In 1986 , activity shifted down the rift to a new vent , named <unk> , where it took on a more effusive character . <unk> built up a low , broad volcanic shield , and lava tubes fed flows extending 11 to 12 km ( about 7 mi ) to the sea . Between 1986 and 1991 , Chain of Craters Road was cut , and the community of Kapa ’ <unk> , the village of Kalapana , and the subdivisions of <unk> Gardens and Royal Gardens were lost to the lava . A black sand beach at Kaimu was also engulfed . In 1992 , the eruption moved back to Puʻu ʻŌʻō , but continued in the same manner , covering nearly all of the 1983 – 86 lava flows and large areas of coastline . As of December 2012 , the eruption had produced 4 km3 ( 1 cu mi ) of lava , covered 125 km2 ( 48 sq mi ) of land , added 202 ha ( 499 acres ) of land to the island , destroyed 214 structures , and buried 14 @.@ 3 km ( 9 mi ) of highway under lava as thick as 35 m ( 115 ft ) . 
 In December 2014 , the June 27 flow from the ongoing eruption threatened to enter the town of <unk> , and to cut Highway 130 , the only route into and out of Lower Puna . As a result , work was begun to reopen Chain of Craters Road , initially as a one @-@ lane gravelled surface , and to make Railroad Avenue and Government Beach Road usable as emergency routes . However the flow stopped just short of entering <unk> , and by March 2015 the threat to the town was much reduced .

 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Because of its position more than 2 @,@ 000 miles from the nearest continental landmass , the island of Hawaiʻi is one of the most geographically isolated landmasses on Earth ; this in turn has strongly influenced its ecology . The majority of the species present on the island are endemic to it and can be found nowhere else on Earth , the result of an isolated evolutionary linage sheltered from external biotic influence ; this makes its ecosystem vulnerable both to invasive species and human development , and an estimated third of the island 's natural flora and fauna has already gone extinct . 
 Kīlauea 's ecological community is additionally threatened by the activity of the volcano itself ; lava flows often overrun sections of the volcano 's forests and burns them down , and volcanic ash distributed by explosive eruptions often smothers local plant life . Layers of carbonized organic material at the bottom of Kīlauea ash deposits are evidence of the many times the volcano has wrought destruction on its own ecosystem and that of its neighbor Mauna Loa , and parts of the volcano present a dichotomy between pristine montane forest and recently buried volcanic " deserts " yet to be recolonized . 
 Kīlauea 's bulk affects local climate conditions through the influence of trade winds coming predominately from the northeast , which , when squeezed upwards by the volcano 's height , results in a moister windward side and a comparatively arid leeward flank . The volcano 's ecology is further complicated by height , though not nearly as much as with its other , far taller neighbors , and by the local distribution of volcanic products , which make for varied soil conditions . The northern part of Kīlauea is mostly below 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 281 ft ) and receives more than 75 in ( 191 cm ) mean annual rainfall , and can mostly be classified as a lowland wet community ; further south , the volcano has squeezed out much of the precipitation and receives less than 50 in ( 127 cm ) mean annual rainfall , and is considered mostly a lowland dry environment . 
 = = = Ecosystems = = = 
 Much of Kīlauea 's southern ecosystem lies within the Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park , where a ’ e ferns , ʻōhiʻa trees ( Metrosideros polymorpha ) , and <unk> ’ u of the genus Cibotium are common . The park hosts a large variety of bird species , including the ' <unk> ( <unk> sanguinea ) , the ' <unk> ( Hemignathus virens ) , the ' i <unk> ( <unk> coccinea ) , the ‘ <unk> ’ o ( <unk> obscurus ) , the <unk> ( <unk> sp . ) , and the endangered ' <unk> ( <unk> coccineus ) , ' <unk> 'au ( Hemignathus munroi ) , <unk> ( Branta sandvicensis ) , ʻuaʻu ( Pterodroma sandwichensis ) , and <unk> ( Buteo solitarius ) species . The Kīlauea coast also hosts three of the nine known critically endangered hawksbill sea turtle ( Eretmochelys imbricata ) nesting sites on the island . 
 Some of the area alongside Kīlauea 's southwestern rift zone takes the form of the unusual <unk> Desert . Although not a " true " desert ( rainfall there exceeds the maximum 1 @,@ 000 mm ( 39 in ) a year ) , precipitation mixing with drifting volcanic sulfur dioxide forms acid rain with a pH as low as 3 @.@ 4 , greatly hampering regional plant growth . The deposited tephra particulates make the local soil very permeable . Plant life in the region is practically nonexistent . 
 Kīlauea 's northern lowland wet forest ecosystem is partially protected by the Puna Forest Reserve and the <unk> Natural Area Reserve . At 27 @,@ 785 acres ( 11 @,@ 244 ha ) , <unk> Kele in particular is Hawaiʻi 's largest lowland wet forest reserve , and is home to rare plant species including <unk> ferns ( Cibotium spp . ) , <unk> vines ( <unk> arborea ) , and <unk> ( Psychotria <unk> ) , some of which play a role in limiting invasive species ' spread . <unk> ( Lasiurus cinereus <unk> ) <unk> ( Buteo solitarius ) , common <unk> ( Hemignathus virens ) , and <unk> <unk> ( Theridion grallator ) live in the trees . There are thought to be many more as @-@ yet @-@ undocumented species within the forest . <unk> Kele 's primary forest tree is ʻōhiʻa <unk> ( Metrosideros polymorpha ) . 
 = = Human history = = 
 = = = Ancient Hawaiian = = = 
 The first Ancient Hawaiians to arrive on Hawaii island lived along the shores , where food and water were plentiful . Flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source . Early settlements had a major impact on the local ecosystem , and caused many extinctions , particularly amongst bird species , as well as introducing foreign plants and animals and increasing erosion rates . The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland ; some of this change was caused by the use of fire , but the main reason appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian rat ( Rattus exulans ) . 
 The summits of the five volcanoes of Hawaii are revered as sacred mountains . Hawaiians associated elements of their natural environment with particular deities . In Hawaiian mythology , the sky father Wākea marries the earth mother Papa , giving birth to the Hawaiian Islands . Kīlauea itself means " spewing " or " much spreading " in Hawaiian , referencing its high state of activity , and in Hawaiian mythology Kīlauea is the body of the deity Pele , goddess of fire , lightning , wind , and volcanoes . It is here that the conflict between Pele and the rain god Kamapuaʻa was centered ; Halemaʻumaʻu , " House of the <unk> fern " , derives its name from the struggle between the two gods . Kamapuaʻa , hard @-@ pressed by Pele 's ability to make lava spout from the ground at will , covered the feature , a favorite residence of the goddess , with fern fronds . Choked by trapped smoke , Pele emerged . Realizing that each could threaten the other with destruction , the others gods called a draw and divided the island between them , with Kamapuaʻa getting the moist windward northeastern side , and Pele directing the drier Kona ( or leeward ) side . The rusty singed appearance of the young fronds of the <unk> is said to be a product of the legendary struggle . 
 This early era was followed by peace and cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century . Land was divided into regions designed for both the immediate needs of the populace and the long @-@ term welfare of the environment . These ahupuaʻa generally took the form of long strips of land oriented from the mountain summits to the coast . 
 = = = Modern era = = = 
 The first foreigner to arrive at Hawaii was James Cook in 1778 . The first non @-@ native to observe Kīlauea in detail was William Ellis , an English missionary who in 1823 spent more than two weeks trekking across the volcano . He collated the first written account of the volcano and observed many of its features , establishing the premise for future explorations of the volcano . 
 One of the earliest and most important surveyors of Kīlauea was James Dwight Dana , who , staying with the missionary Titus Coan , studied the island 's volcanoes in detail for decades first @-@ hand . Dana visited Kīlauea 's summit and described it in detail in 1840 . After publishing a summary paper in 1852 , he directed a detailed geological study of the island in 1880 and 1881 but did not consider Kīlauea a separate volcano , instead referring to it as a flank vent of Mauna Loa ; it was not until another geologist , C. E. Dutton , had elaborated on Dana 's research during an 1884 expedition that Kīlauea came to be generally accepted as a separate entity . 
 The next era of Kīlauea 's history began with the establishment of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory on the volcano 's rim in 1912 . The first permanent such installation in the United States , the observatory was the brainchild of Thomas Jaggar , head of geology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ; after witnessing the devastation of the 1908 Messina earthquake near Mount Etna in Italy , he declared that something must be done to support systematic volcanic and seismic study , and chose Kīlauea as the site of the first such establishment . After securing initial funding from MIT and the University of Hawaii , Jaggar took directorship of the observatory and , whilst its head between 1912 and 1940 , pioneered seismological and observational study and observation of active volcanoes . After initial funding ran out , the Observatory was successively funded by the National Weather Service , the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) , and the National Park Service , before settling on the USGS , under whose banner the observatory has been operating since 1947 . The main building has been moved twice since establishment , and today is positioned on the northwest rim of Kīlauea 's caldera . 
 = = Tourism = = 
 The volcano became a tourist attraction from the 1840s onwards , and local businessmen such as Benjamin Pitman and George Lycurgus ran a series of hotels at the rim , including Volcano House which is still the only hotel or restaurant located within the borders of the Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park . In 1891 , Lorrin A. Thurston , grandson of the American missionary Asa Thurston and investor in hotels along the volcano 's rim , began campaigning for a park on the volcano 's slopes , an idea first proposed by William Richards Castle , Jr. in 1903 . Thurston , who owned the Honolulu Advertiser newspaper , printed editorials in favor of the idea ; by 1911 Governor Walter F. Frear had proposed a draft bill to create " Kilauea National Park " . Following endorsements from John Muir , Henry Cabot Lodge , and former President Theodore Roosevelt ( in opposition to local ranchers ) and several legislative attempts introduced by delegate Jonah <unk> <unk> <unk> , House Resolution 9525 was signed into law by Woodrow Wilson on August 1 , 1916 . It was the 11th National Park in the United States , and the first in a Territory ; a few weeks later , the National Park Service Organic Act was signed into law , creating the National Park Service and tasking it with running the expanding system . Originally called " Hawaii National Park " , it was split from the Haleakala National Park on 22 September 1960 . Today the park , renamed the Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park , is a major conservatory agency and tourist attraction , and , since 1987 , a World Heritage Site . 
 In its early days tourism was a relatively new concept , but grew slowly before exploding with the advent of air travel around 1959 , the year Hawaiʻi became a state . Today tourism is driven by the island 's exotic tropical locations , and Kīlauea , being one of the few volcanoes in the world in a more or less constant state of moderate eruption , is a major part of the island 's tourist draw . Today , Kīlauea is visited by roughly 2 @.@ 6 million people annually , most of whom proceed up the volcano from the recently revamped Kilauea Visitor Center near the park entrance . The Thomas A. Jaggar Museum is also a popular tourist stop ; located at the edge of Kīlauea caldera , the museum 's observation deck offers the best sheltered view on the volcano of the activity at Halemaumau Crater . The Volcano House still provides the nearest lodging , and the nearby Volcano Village the most numerous ; visitors associated with the military can find lodging at the Kilauea Military Camp . A number of hiking trails , points of interest , and guided ranger programs exist , and the Chain of Craters Road , Hilina Pali Road , and Crater Rim Drive provide access . 
 = Gray wolf = 
 The gray wolf or grey wolf ( Canis lupus ) , also known as the timber wolf or western wolf , is a canid native to the wilderness and remote areas of Eurasia and North America . It is the largest extant member of its family , with males averaging 43 – 45 kg ( 95 – 99 lb ) , and females 36 – 38 @.@ 5 kg ( 79 – 85 lb ) . Like the red wolf , it is distinguished from other Canis species by its larger size and less pointed features , particularly on the ears and muzzle . Its winter fur is long and bushy , and predominantly a mottled gray in color , although nearly pure white , red , or brown to black also occur . As of 2005 , 37 subspecies of C. lupus are recognised by MSW3 . 
 The gray wolf is the second most specialised member of the genus Canis , after the Ethiopian wolf , as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting large prey , its more gregarious nature , and its highly advanced expressive behavior . It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species , such as the eastern wolf , coyote , and golden jackal to produce fertile hybrids . It is the only species of Canis to have a range encompassing both the Old and New Worlds , and originated in Eurasia during the Pleistocene , colonizing North America on at least three separate occasions during the Rancholabrean . It is a social animal , travelling in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair , accompanied by the pair 's adult offspring . The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range , with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it . It feeds primarily on large ungulates , though it also eats smaller animals , livestock , carrion , and garbage . 
 The gray wolf is one of the world 's best known and well researched animals , with probably more books written about it than any other wildlife species . It has a long history of association with humans , having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of its attacks on livestock , while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter @-@ gatherer societies . Although the fear of wolves is pervasive in many human societies , the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies . Non @-@ rabid wolves have attacked and killed people , mainly children , but this is rare , as wolves are relatively few , live away from people , and have developed a fear of humans from hunters and shepherds .

 The English ' wolf ' stems from the Old English <unk> , which is itself thought to be derived from the Proto @-@ Germanic * <unk> . The Latin lupus is a Sabine loanword . Both derive from the Proto @-@ Indo @-@ European root * <unk> / * <unk> .

 = = = Taxonomy = = = 
 Canis lupus was recorded by Carl Linnaeus in his publication Systema Naturae in 1758 . The Latin classification translates into English as " dog wolf " . The subspecies of Canis lupus are listed in Mammal Species of the World . The nominate subspecies is the Eurasian wolf ( Canis lupus lupus ) , also known as the common wolf . As of 2005 37 subspecies of C. lupus are recognised by MSW3 , however the classification of several as either species or subspecies has recently been challenged . 
 = = = Evolution and relationship with the dog = = = 
 The evolution of the wolf occurred over a geologic time scale of 800 thousand years , transforming the first Middle Pleistocene wolf specimen that is recognized as being morphologically similar to Canis lupus into today 's dog , dingo and gray wolf . Ecological factors including habitat type , climate , prey specialization and predatory competition will greatly influence the wolf 's genetic population structure and cranio @-@ dental plasticity . Wolves went through a population bottleneck 20 @,@ 000 years before present ( <unk> ) , which indicates that many wolf populations had gone extinct at a time that coincided with the Last Glacial Maximum and the expansion of modern humans worldwide with their technology for capturing large game . The domestic dog is the most widely abundant large carnivore and a descendant from one of those now @-@ extinct wolf populations . Today , the wolf is represented by the many extant subspecies of Canis lupus , which includes the dog and dingo .

 Globally , C. lupus taxonomy has been subject to numerous revisions , particularly in North America . As of 2005 , 37 subspecies of C. lupus are recognised by MSW3 . Its list includes the domestic dog , dingo , eastern wolf and red wolf , but lists C. l. <unk> and C. l. communis as synonyms of C. l. lupus . 
 = = = Hybridization with other Canis = = = 
 Dogs and gray wolves do not voluntarily interbreed in the wild , though they can produce fertile wolf @-@ dog offspring . In North America , black colored wolves acquired their coloration from wolf @-@ dog hybridization , which occurred 10 @,@ 000 – 15 @,@ 000 years ago . Like pure wolves , hybrids breed once annually , though their mating season occurs three months earlier , with pups mostly being born in the winter period , thus lessening their chances of survival . However , one genetic study undertaken in the Caucasus Mountains showed that as many as 10 % of dogs in the area , including livestock guardian dogs , are first generation hybrids . The captive breeding of wolf @-@ dog hybrids has proliferated in the USA , with 300 @,@ 000 such animals being present there . 
 The gray wolf has interbred extensively with the eastern wolf producing a hybrid population termed Great Lakes boreal wolves . Unlike the red and eastern wolf , the gray wolf does not readily interbreed with coyotes . Nevertheless , coyote genetic markers have been found in some wild isolated gray wolf populations in the southern United States . Gray wolf Y @-@ chromosomes have also been found in Texan coyote haplotypes . In tests performed on a putative chupacabra carcass , mtDNA analysis showed that it was a coyote , though subsequent tests revealed that it was a coyote – gray wolf hybrid sired by a male Mexican gray wolf . In 2013 , a captive breeding experiment in Utah between gray wolves and western coyotes produced six hybrids through artificial insemination , making this the very first hybridization case between pure coyotes and northwestern gray wolves . At six months of age , the hybrids were closely monitored and were shown to display both physical and behavioral characteristics from both species . Although hybridization between wolves and golden jackals has never been observed , evidence of such occurrences was discovered through mtDNA analysis on jackals in Bulgaria . Although there is no genetic evidence of gray wolf @-@ jackal hybridization in the Caucasus Mountains , there have been cases where otherwise genetically pure golden jackals have displayed remarkably gray wolf @-@ like phenotypes , to the point of being mistaken for wolves by trained biologists . 
 = = Physical description = = 
 = = = Anatomy and dimensions = = = 
 Compared to its closest wild cousins ( the coyote and golden jackal ) , the gray wolf is larger and heavier , with a broader snout , shorter ears , a shorter torso and longer tail . It is a slender , powerfully built animal with a large , deeply descending ribcage , a sloping back and a heavily muscled neck . The wolf 's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids , which enables the animal to move swiftly , and allows it to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range . Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads , thinner necks , slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males . 
 The gray wolf 's head is large and heavy , with a wide forehead , strong jaws and a long , blunt muzzle . The ears are relatively small and triangular . The teeth are heavy and large , being better suited to crushing bone than those of other extant canids , though not as specialised as those found in hyenas . Its molars have a flat chewing surface , but not to the same extent as the coyote , whose diet contains more vegetable matter . The gray wolf 's jaws can exert a crushing pressure of perhaps 10 @,@ 340 kPa ( 1 @,@ 500 psi ) compared to 5 @,@ 200 kPa ( 750 psi ) for a German shepherd . This force is sufficient to break open most bones . A study of the estimated bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators when adjusted for the body mass found that for placental mammals , the bite force at the canines ( in Newtons / kilogram of body weight ) was greatest in the extinct dire wolf ( 163 ) , then followed among the extant canids by the four <unk> that often prey on animals larger than themselves : the African hunting dog ( 142 ) , the gray wolf ( 136 ) , the dhole ( 112 ) , and the dingo ( 108 ) . 
 The gray wolf usually carries its head at the same level as the back , raising it only when alert . It usually travels at a loping pace , placing its paws one directly in front of the other . This gait can be maintained for hours at a rate of 8 – 9 km / h , and allows the wolf to cover great distances . On bare paths , a wolf can quickly achieve speeds of 50 – 60 km / h . The gray wolf has a running gait of 55 to 70 km / h , can leap 5 metres horizontally in a single bound , and can maintain rapid pursuit for at least 20 minutes . 
 The gray wolf is the largest extant member of the Canidae , excepting certain large breeds of domestic dog . Gray wolf weight and size can vary greatly worldwide , tending to increase proportionally with latitude as predicted by Bergmann 's Rule , with the large wolves of Alaska and Canada sometimes weighing 3 – 6 times more than their Middle Eastern and South Asian cousins . On average , adult wolves measure 105 – 160 cm ( 41 – 63 in ) in length and 80 – 85 cm ( 32 – 34 in ) in shoulder height . The tail measures 29 – 50 cm ( 11 – 20 in ) in length . The ears are 90 – 110 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 3 in ) in height , and the hind feet are 220 – 250 millimetres ( 8 @.@ 7 – 9 @.@ 8 in ) . The skull averages 9 – 11 inches in length , and 5 – 6 inches wide . The mean body mass of the extant gray wolf is 40 kg ( 88 lb ) , with the smallest specimen recorded at 12 kg ( 26 lb ) and the largest at 80 kg ( 176 lb ) . Gray wolf weight varies geographically ; on average , European wolves may weigh 38 @.@ 5 kilograms ( 85 lb ) , North American wolves 36 kilograms ( 79 lb ) and Indian and Arabian wolves 25 kilograms ( 55 lb ) . Females in any given wolf population typically weigh 5 – 10 lbs less than males . Wolves weighing over 54 kg ( 120 lbs ) are uncommon , though exceptionally large individuals have been recorded in Alaska , Canada , and the forests of western Russia . The heaviest recorded gray wolf in North America was killed on 70 Mile River in east @-@ central Alaska on July 12 , 1939 and weighed 79 @.@ 4 kilograms ( 175 lb ) . 
 = = = Fur = = = 
 The gray wolf has very dense and fluffy winter fur , with short underfur and long , coarse guard hairs . Most of the underfur and some of the guard hairs are shed in the spring and grow back in the autumn period . The longest hairs occur on the back , particularly on the front quarters and neck . Especially long hairs are on the shoulders , and almost form a crest on the upper part of the neck . The hairs on the cheeks are elongated and form tufts . The ears are covered in short hairs , which strongly project from the fur . Short , elastic and closely adjacent hairs are present on the limbs from the elbows down to the <unk> tendons . The winter fur is highly resistant to cold ; wolves in northern climates can rest comfortably in open areas at − 40 ° by placing their muzzles between the rear legs and covering their faces with their tail . Wolf fur provides better insulation than dog fur , and does not collect ice when warm breath is condensed against it . In warm climates , the fur is coarser and scarcer than in northern wolves . Female wolves tend to have smoother furred limbs than males , and generally develop the smoothest overall coats as they age . Older wolves generally have more white hairs in the tip of the tail , along the nose and on the forehead . The winter fur is retained longest in lactating females , though with some hair loss around their nipples . Hair length on the middle of the back is 60 – 70 mm . Hair length of the guard hairs on the shoulders generally does not exceed 90 mm , but can reach 110 – 130 mm . 
 Coat color ranges from almost pure white through various shades of blond , cream , and ochre to grays , browns , and blacks , with variation in fur color tending to increase in higher latitudes . Differences in coat color between sexes are largely absent , though females may have redder tones . Black colored wolves in North America inherited the Kb allele responsible for melanism from past interbreeding with dogs , while the mutation was found to be naturally occurring in wolves from Iran . Black specimens are more common in North America than in Eurasia , with about half the wolves in Yellowstone National Park being black . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 = = = Social and territorial behaviors = = = 
 The gray wolf is a social animal , whose basic social unit consists of a mated pair , accompanied by the pair 's adult offspring . The average pack consists of a family of 5 – 11 animals ( 1 – 2 adults , 3 – 6 juveniles and 1 – 3 yearlings ) , or sometimes two or three such families , with exceptionally large packs consisting of 42 wolves being known . In ideal conditions , the mated pair produces pups every year , with such offspring typically staying in the pack for 10 – 54 months before dispersing . Triggers for dispersal include the onset of sexual maturity and competition within the pack for food . The distance travelled by dispersing wolves varies widely ; some stay in the vicinity of the parental group , while other individuals may travel great distances of 390 km , 206 km , and 670 km from their natal packs . A new pack is usually founded by an unrelated dispersing male and female , travelling together in search of an area devoid of other hostile packs . Wolf packs rarely adopt other wolves into their fold , and typically kill them . In the rare cases where other wolves are adopted , the adoptee is almost invariably an immature animal ( 1 – 3 years of age ) unlikely to compete for breeding rights with the mated pair . In some cases , a lone wolf is adopted into a pack to replace a deceased breeder . During times of ungulate abundance ( migration , calving etc . ) , different wolf packs may temporarily join forces . 
 Wolves are highly territorial animals , and generally establish territories far larger than they require to survive in order to assure a steady supply of prey . Territory size depends largely on the amount of prey available and the age of the pack 's pups , tending to increase in size in areas with low prey populations or when the pups reach the age of 6 months , thus having the same nutritional needs as adults . Wolf packs travel constantly in search of prey , covering roughly 9 % of their territory per day ( average 25 km / d or 15 mi / d ) . The core of their territory is on average 35 km2 ( 14 sq mi ) , in which they spend 50 % of their time . Prey density tends to be much higher in the territory 's surrounding areas , though wolves tend to avoid hunting in the fringes of their range unless desperate , because of the possibility of fatal encounters with neighboring packs . The smallest territory on record was held by a pack of six wolves in northeastern Minnesota , which occupied an estimated 33 km2 ( 13 sq mi ) , while the largest was held by an Alaskan pack of ten wolves encompassing a 6 @,@ 272 km2 ( 2 @,@ 422 sq mi ) area . Wolf packs are typically settled , and usually only leave their accustomed ranges during severe food shortages . 
 Wolves defend their territories from other packs through a combination of scent marking , direct attacks and howling ( see Communication ) . Scent marking is used for territorial advertisement , and involves urination , defecation and ground scratching . Scent marks are generally left every 240 metres throughout the territory on regular <unk> and junctions . Such markers can last for 2 – 3 weeks , and are typically placed near rocks , boulders , trees or the skeletons of large animals . Territorial fights are among the principal causes of wolf mortality , with one study concluding that 14 – 65 % of wolf deaths in Minnesota and the Denali National Park and Preserve were due to predation by other wolves . 
 = = = Reproduction and development = = = 
 The gray wolf is generally monogamous , with mated pairs usually remaining together for life , unless one of the pair dies . Upon the death of one mated wolf , pairs are quickly re @-@ established . Since males often predominate in any given wolf population , unpaired females are a rarity . If a dispersing male gray wolf is unable to establish a territory or find a mate , he mates with the daughters of already established breeding pairs from other packs . Such gray wolves are termed " Casanova wolves " and , unlike males from established packs , they do not form pair bonds with the females they mate with . Some gray wolf packs may have multiple breeding females this way , as is the case in Yellowstone National Park . Gray wolves also practice alloparental care , in which a wolf pair may adopt the pup or pups of another . This might take place if the original parents die or are for some reason separated from them . In addition to heterosexual behavior , homosexual behavior has been observed in gray wolves . Male gray wolves often mount each other when the highest ranking female in the pack comes into heat . 
 The age of first breeding in gray wolves depends largely on environmental factors : when food is plentiful , or when wolf populations are heavily managed , wolves can rear pups at younger ages in order to better exploit abundant resources . This is further demonstrated by the fact that captive wolves have been known to breed as soon as they reach 9 – 10 months , while the youngest recorded breeding wolves in the wild were 2 years old . Females are capable of producing pups every year , with one litter annually being the average . Unlike the coyote , the gray wolf never reaches reproductive senescence . Estrus typically occurs in late winter , with older , multiparous females entering estrus 2 – 3 weeks earlier than younger females . During pregnancy , female wolves remain in a den located away from the peripheral zone of their territories , where violent encounters with other packs are more likely . Old females usually whelp in the den of their previous litter , while younger females typically den near their birthplace . The gestation period lasts 62 – 75 days , with pups usually being born in the summer period . 
 Wolves bear relatively large pups in small litters compared to other canid species . The average litter consists of 5 – 6 pups , with litter sizes tending to increase in areas where prey is abundant , though exceptionally large litters of 14 – 17 pups occur only 1 % of the time . Pups are usually born in spring , coinciding with a corresponding increase in prey populations . Pups are born blind and deaf , and are covered in short soft grayish @-@ brown fur . They weigh 300 – 500 grams at birth , and begin to see after 9 – 12 days . The milk canines erupt after one month . Pups first leave the den after 3 weeks . At 1 @.@ 5 months of age , they are agile enough to flee from danger . Mother wolves do not leave the den for the first few weeks , relying on the fathers to provide food for them and their young . Pups begin to eat solid food at the age of 3 – 4 weeks . Pups have a fast growth rate during their first four months of life : during this period , a pup 's weight can increase nearly 30 times . Wolf pups begin play fighting at the age of 3 weeks , though unlike young foxes and coyotes , their bites are inhibited . Actual fights to establish hierarchy usually occur at 5 – 8 weeks of age . This is in contrast to young foxes and coyotes , which may begin fighting even before the onset of play behavior . By autumn , the pups are mature enough to accompany adults on hunts for large prey . 
 = = = Hunting and feeding behaviors = = = 
 Although social animals , single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs , with single wolves having occasionally been observed to kill large prey such as moose , bison and muskoxen unaided . The gray wolf 's sense of smell is relatively weakly developed when compared to that of some hunting dog breeds , being able to detect carrion upwind no farther than 2 – 3 km . Because of this , it rarely manages to capture hidden hares or birds , though it can easily follow fresh tracks . Its auditory perception is acute enough to be able to hear up to a frequency of 26 kHz , which is sufficient to register the fall of leaves in the autumn period . A gray wolf hunt can be divided into five stages : 
 Locating prey : The wolves travel in search of prey through their power of scent , chance encounter , and tracking . Wolves typically locate their prey by scent , though they must usually be directly downwind of it . When a breeze carrying the prey 's scent is located , the wolves stand alert , and point their eyes , ears and nose towards their target . In open areas , wolves may precede the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose @-@ to @-@ nose and wagging their tails . Once concluded , the wolves head towards their prey . 
 The stalk : The wolves attempt to conceal themselves as they approach . As the gap between the wolves and their prey closes , the wolves quicken their pace , wag their tails , and peer intently , getting as close to their quarry as possible without making it flee . 
 The encounter : Once the prey detects the wolves , it can either approach the wolves , stand its ground , or flee . Large prey , such as moose , elk , and muskoxen , usually stand their ground . Should this occur , the wolves hold back , as they require the stimulus of a running animal to proceed with an attack . If the targeted animal stands its ground , the wolves either ignore it , or try to intimidate it into running . 
 The rush : If the prey attempts to flee , the wolves immediately pursue it . This is the most critical stage of the hunt , as wolves may never catch up with prey running at top speed . If their prey is travelling in a group , the wolves either attempt to break up the herd , or isolate one or two animals from it . 
 The chase : A continuation of the rush , the wolves attempt to catch up with their prey and kill it . When chasing small prey , wolves attempt to catch up with their prey as soon as possible , while with larger animals , the chase is prolonged , in order to wear the selected prey out . Wolves usually give up chases after 1 – 2 km ( 0 @.@ 62 – 1 @.@ 3 mi ) , though one wolf was recorded to chase a deer for 21 km ( 13 mi ) . Both Russian and North American wolves have been observed to drive prey onto crusted ice , precipices , ravines , slopes and steep banks to slow them down . 
 The actual killing method varies according to prey species . With large prey , mature wolves usually avoid attacking frontally , instead focusing on the rear and sides of the animal . Large prey , such as moose , is killed by biting large chunks of flesh from the soft perineum area , causing massive blood loss . Such bites can cause wounds 10 – 15 cm in length , with three such bites to the perineum usually being sufficient to bring down a large deer in optimum health . With medium @-@ sized prey such as roe deer or sheep , wolves kill by biting the throat , severing nerve tracks and the carotid artery , thus causing the animal to die within a few seconds to a minute . With small , mouse @-@ like prey , wolves leap in a high arc and immobilize it with their forepaws . When prey is vulnerable and abundant , wolves may occasionally surplus kill . Such instances are common in domestic animals , but rare in the wild . In the wild , surplus killing primarily occurs during late winter or spring , when snow is unusually deep ( thus impeding the movements of prey ) or during the denning period , when wolves require a ready supply of meat when <unk> . Medium @-@ sized prey are especially vulnerable to surplus killing , as the swift throat @-@ biting method by which they are killed allows wolves to quickly kill one animal and move on to another . 
 Once prey is brought down , wolves begin to feed excitedly , ripping and tugging at the carcass in all directions , and bolting down large chunks of it . The breeding pair typically monopolizes food in order to continue producing pups . When food is scarce , this is done at the expense of other family members , especially non @-@ pups . The breeding pair typically eats first , though as it is they who usually work the hardest in killing prey , they may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat unmolested . Once the breeding pair has finished eating , the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace . Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey , such as the heart , liver , lungs and stomach lining . The kidneys and spleen are eaten once they are exposed , followed by the muscles . A single wolf can eat 15 – 19 % of its body weight in a single feeding . 
 = = Communication = = 
 = = = Visual = = = 
 The gray wolf 's expressive behavior is more complex than that of the coyote and golden jackal , as necessitated by its group living and hunting habits . While less gregarious canids generally possess simple repertoires of visual signals , wolves have more varied signals that subtly inter grade in intensity . When neutral , the legs are not stiffened , the tail hangs down loosely , the face is smooth , the lips <unk> , and the ears point in no particular direction . Postural communication in wolves consists of a variety of facial expressions , tail positions and piloerection . Aggressive , or self @-@ assertive wolves are characterized by their slow and deliberate movements , high body posture and raised hackles , while submissive ones carry their bodies low , <unk> their fur and lower their ears and tail . When a breeding male encounters a subordinate family member , it may stare at it , standing erect and still with the tails horizontal to its spine . Two forms of submissive behavior are recognized : passive and active . Passive submission usually occurs as a reaction to the approach of a dominant animal , and consists of the submissive wolf lying partly on its back and allowing the dominant wolf to sniff its anogenital area . Active submission occurs often as a form of greeting , and involves the submissive wolf approaching another in a low posture , and licking the other wolf 's face . When wolves are together , they commonly indulge in behaviors such as nose pushing , jaw wrestling , cheek rubbing and facial licking . The mouthing of each other 's muzzles is a friendly gesture , while clamping on the muzzle with bared teeth is a dominance display . 
 Similar to humans , gray wolves have facial color patterns in which the gaze direction can be easily identified , although this is often not the case in other canid species . In 2014 , a study compared the facial color pattern across 25 canid species . The results suggested that that the facial color pattern of canid species is related to their gaze communication , and that especially gray wolves use the gaze signal in conspecific communication . 
 = = = Auditory = = = 
 Gray wolves howl to assemble the pack ( usually before and after hunts ) , to pass on an alarm ( particularly at a den site ) , to locate each other during a storm or unfamiliar territory and to communicate across great distances . Wolf howls can under certain conditions be heard over areas of up to 130 km2 ( 50 sq mi ) . Wolf howls are generally indistinguishable from those of large dogs . Male wolves give voice through an octave , passing to a deep bass with a stress on " O " , while females produce a modulated nasal baritone with stress on " U " . Pups almost never howl , while yearling wolves produce howls ending in a series of dog @-@ like yelps . Howling consists of a fundamental frequency that may lie between 150 and 780 Hz , and consists of up to 12 harmonically related overtones . The pitch usually remains constant or varies smoothly , and may change direction as many as four or five times . <unk> used for calling pack mates to a kill are long , smooth sounds similar to the beginning of the cry of a horned owl . When pursuing prey , they emit a higher pitched howl , vibrating on two notes . When closing in on their prey , they emit a combination of a short bark and a howl . When howling together , wolves harmonize rather than chorus on the same note , thus creating the illusion of there being more wolves than there actually are . Lone wolves typically avoid howling in areas where other packs are present . Wolves from different geographic locations may howl in different fashions : the howls of European wolves are much more protracted and melodious than those of North American wolves , whose howls are louder and have a stronger emphasis on the first syllable . The two are however mutually intelligible , as North American wolves have been recorded to respond to European @-@ style howls made by biologists . 
 Other vocalisations of wolves are usually divided into three categories : growls , barks and whines . Barking has a fundamental frequency between 320 – 904 Hz , and is usually emitted by startled wolves . Wolves do not bark as loudly or continuously as dogs do , but bark a few times and retreat from perceived danger . Growling has a fundamental frequency of 380 – 450 Hz , and is usually emitted during food challenges . Pups commonly growl when playing . One variation of the howl is accompanied by a high pitched whine , which precedes a lunging attack . <unk> is associated with situations of anxiety , curiosity , inquiry and intimacy such as greeting , feeding pups and playing . 
 = = = Olfactory = = = 
 Olfaction is probably the wolf 's most acute sense , and plays a fundamental role in communication . The wolf has a large number of apocrine sweat glands on the face , lips , back , and between the toes . The odor produced by these glands varies according to the individual wolf 's microflora and diet , giving each a distinct " odor fingerprint " . A combination of apocrine and <unk> sweat glands on the feet allows the wolf to deposit its scent whilst scratching the ground , which usually occurs after urine marking and defecation during the breeding season . The follicles present on the guard hairs from the wolf 's back have clusters of apocrine and sebaceous glands at their bases . As the skin on the back is usually folded , this provides a microclimate for bacterial propagation around the glands . During piloerection , the guard hairs on the back are raised and the skin folds spread , thus releasing scent . The pre @-@ caudal scent glands may play a role in expressing aggression , as combative wolves raise the base of their tails whilst drooping the tip , thus positioning the scent glands at the highest point . The wolf possesses a pair of anal sacs beneath the rectum , which contain both apocrine and sebaceous glands . The components of anal sac secretions vary according to season and gender , thus indicating that the secretions provide information related to gender and reproductive state . The secretions of the preputial glands may advertise hormonal condition or social position , as dominant wolves have been observed to stand over subordinates , apparently presenting the genital area for investigation , which may include genital licking . During the breeding season , female wolves secrete substances from the vagina , which communicate the females ' reproductive state , and can be detected by males from long distances . Urine marking is the best @-@ studied means of olfactory communication in wolves . Its exact function is debated , though most researchers agree that its primary purpose is to establish boundaries . Wolves urine mark more frequently and vigorously in unfamiliar areas , or areas of intrusion , where the scent of other wolves or canids is present . So @-@ called raised leg urination ( RLU ) is more common in male wolves than in females , and may serve the purpose of maximizing the possibility of detection by conspecifics , as well as reflect the height of the marking wolf . Only dominant wolves typically use RLU , with subordinate males continuing to use the juvenile standing posture throughout adulthood . RLU is considered to be one of the most important forms of scent communication in the wolf , making up 60 – 80 % of all scent marks observed . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Habitat = = = 
 The gray wolf is a habitat generalist , and can occur in deserts , grasslands , forests and arctic <unk> . Habitat use by gray wolves is strongly correlated with the abundance of prey , snow conditions , absence or low livestock densities , road densities , human presence and topography . In cold climates , the gray wolf can reduce the flow of blood near its skin to conserve body heat . The warmth of the footpads is regulated independently of the rest of the body , and is maintained at just above tissue @-@ freezing point where the pads come in contact with ice and snow . Gray wolves use different places for their diurnal rest : places with cover are preferred during cold , damp and windy weather , while wolves in dry , calm and warm weather readily rest in the open . During the autumn @-@ spring period , when wolves are more active , they willingly lie out in the open , whatever their location . Actual dens are usually constructed for pups during the summer period . When building dens , females make use of natural shelters such as fissures in rocks , cliffs overhanging riverbanks and holes thickly covered by vegetation . Sometimes , the den is the appropriated burrow of smaller animals such as foxes , badgers or marmots . An appropriated den is often widened and partly remade . On rare occasions , female wolves dig burrows themselves , which are usually small and short with 1 – 3 openings . The den is usually constructed not more than 500 metres away from a water source , and typically faces southwards , thus ensuring enough sunlight exposure , keeping the denning area relatively snow free . Resting places , play areas for the pups and food remains are commonly found around wolf dens . The odour of urine and rotting food emanating from the denning area often attracts scavenging birds such as magpies and ravens . As there are few convenient places for burrows , wolf dens are usually occupied by animals of the same family . Though they mostly avoid areas within human sight , wolves have been known to nest near domiciles , paved roads and railways . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 All social terrestrial mammalian predators feed mostly on terrestrial herbivorous mammals with a body mass similar to the combined mass of the social group members attacking the prey animal , and a pack of timber wolves can bring down a 500 kg moose as their preferred prey . The gray wolf generally specializes in vulnerable individuals of large prey . In Eurasia , many gray wolf populations are forced to subsist largely on livestock and garbage in areas with dense human activity , though wild ungulates such as moose , red deer , roe deer and wild boar are still the most important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of Eastern Europe . Other prey species include reindeer , <unk> , mouflon , wisent , saiga , ibex , chamois , wild goats , fallow deer and musk deer . The prey animals of North American wolves have largely continued to occupy suitable habitats with low human density , and cases of wolves subsisting largely on garbage or livestock are exceptional . Animals preferred as prey by North American wolves include moose , white @-@ tailed deer , elk , mule deer , bighorn sheep , Dall 's sheep , American bison , muskox and caribou . 
 Although wolves primarily feed on medium to large sized ungulates , they are not fussy eaters . Smaller sized animals that may supplement the diet of wolves include marmots , hares , badgers , foxes , weasels , ground squirrels , mice , hamsters , voles and other rodents , as well as insectivores . They frequently eat waterfowl and their eggs . When such foods are insufficient , they prey on lizards , snakes , frogs , rarely toads and large insects as available . In times of scarcity , wolves readily eat carrion , visiting cattle burial grounds and slaughter houses . Cannibalism is not uncommon in wolves : during harsh winters , packs often attack weak or injured wolves , and may eat the bodies of dead pack members . Wolf packs in Astrakhan hunt Caspian seals on the Caspian Sea coastline and some wolf packs in Alaska and Western Canada have been observed to feed on salmon . Humans are rarely , but occasionally preyed upon . Other primates occasionally taken by wolves include grey langurs in Nepal and hamadryas baboons in Saudi Arabia . 
 Wolves supplement their diet with fruit and vegetable matter . They willingly eat the berries of mountain ash , lily of the valley , <unk> , blueberries and <unk> . Other fruits include nightshade , apples and pears . They readily visit melon fields during the summer months . A well @-@ fed wolf stores fat under the skin , around the heart , intestines , kidneys , and bone marrow , particularly during the autumn and winter . Digestion only takes a few hours , thus wolves can feed several times in one day , making quick use of large quantities of meat . 
 = = = Enemies and competitors = = = 
 Gray wolves typically dominate other canid species in areas where they both occur . In North America , incidents of gray wolves killing coyotes are common , particularly in winter , when coyotes feed on wolf kills . Wolves may attack coyote den sites , digging out and killing their pups , though rarely eating them . There are no records of coyotes killing wolves , though coyotes may chase wolves if they outnumber them . Near identical interactions have been observed in Eurasia between gray wolves and golden jackals , with the latter 's numbers being comparatively small in areas with high wolf densities . Gray wolves are the most important predator of raccoon dogs , killing large numbers of them in the spring and summer periods . Wolves also kill red , arctic and corsac foxes , usually in disputes over carcasses , sometimes eating them . In Asia , they may compete with dholes , though there is at least one record of a lone wolf associating with a pair of dholes in <unk> Wildlife Sanctuary . 
 Brown bears typically dominate wolf packs in disputes over carcasses , while wolf packs mostly prevail against bears when defending their den sites . Both species kill each other 's young . Wolves eat the brown bears they kill , while brown bears seem to only eat young wolves . Wolf interactions with American black bears are much rarer than with brown bears , because of differences in habitat preferences . The majority of black bear encounters with wolves occur in the species ' northern range , with no interactions being recorded in Mexico . Wolves have been recorded on numerous occasions to actively seek out black bears in their dens and kill them without eating them . Unlike brown bears , black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills . While encounters with brown and black bears appear to be common , polar bears are rarely encountered by wolves , though there are two records of wolf packs killing polar bear cubs . Wolves also kill the cubs of Asian black bears . 
 Wolves may encounter striped hyenas in Israel , Central Asia and India , usually in disputes over carcasses . Striped hyenas feed extensively on wolf @-@ killed carcasses in areas where the two species interact . One @-@ to @-@ one , hyenas dominate wolves , but wolf packs can drive off single or outnumbered hyenas . However , there was a case of a female striped hyena dominating 12 Arabian wolves . Two cases are known however from southern Israel , where wolves and striped hyenas associated closely with each other in an apparently amicable way . 
 Large wolf populations limit the numbers of small to medium @-@ sized felines . Wolves encounter cougars along portions of the Rocky Mountains and adjacent mountain ranges . Wolves and cougars typically avoid encountering each other by hunting on different elevations . In winter , however , when snow accumulation forces their prey into valleys , interactions between the two species become more likely . Wolves in packs usually dominate cougars and can steal kills . They have been reported killing mothers and their kittens . Wolves hunt steppe cats , and may scavenge from snow leopard kills . Wolves may also reduce Eurasian lynx populations . Wolves may kill lynxes by running them down , or killing them before they can escape into trees . Similar reports of encounters between wolves and bobcats have been documented . 
 Leftovers of wolf kills are sometimes scavenged by wolverines . Wolverines usually wait until the wolves are done feeding , but have been known to drive away wolves from kills . However , there have been confirmed reports of wolf packs killing wolverines . 
 Other than humans , tigers appear to be the only serious predators of wolves . Wolf and tiger interactions are well documented in Sikhote @-@ Alin , where tigers depress wolf numbers , either to the point of localized extinction or to such low numbers as to make them a functionally insignificant component of the ecosystem . Wolves appear capable of escaping competitive exclusion from tigers only when human persecution decreases tiger numbers . Proven cases of tigers killing wolves are rare and attacks appear to be competitive rather than predatory in nature , with at least four proven records of tigers killing wolves without consuming them . 
 = = Range and conservation = = 
 The gray wolf was once one of the world 's most widely distributed mammals , living throughout the northern hemisphere north of 15 ° N latitude in North America and 12 ° N in India . However , deliberate human persecution has reduced the species ' range to about one third , because of livestock predation and fear over attacks on humans . The species is now extinct in much of Western Europe , in Mexico and much of the United States . In modern times , the gray wolf occurs mostly in wilderness and remote areas , particularly in Canada , Alaska and northern USA , Europe , and Asia from about 75 ° N to 12 ° N. Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s , and have fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range , due to legal protection , changes in land @-@ use and rural human population shifts to cities . Competition with humans for livestock and game species , concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people , and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the species . Despite these threats , because of the gray wolf 's relatively widespread range and stable population , it is classified as least concern by the IUCN .

 = = = = Decline = = = = 
 Although wolf @-@ dog hybridization in Europe has raised concern among conservation groups fearing for the gray wolf 's purity , genetic tests show that introgression of dog genes into European gray wolf populations does not pose a significant threat . Also , as wolf and dog mating seasons do not fully coincide , the likelihood of wild wolves and dogs mating and producing surviving offspring is small . 
 The extermination of Northern Europe 's wolves first became an organized effort during the Middle Ages , and continued until the late 1800s . In England , wolf persecution was enforced by legislation , and the last wolf was killed in the early sixteenth century during the reign of Henry VII . Wolves lasted longer in Scotland , where they sheltered in vast tracts of forest , which were subsequently burned down . Wolves managed to survive in the forests of Braemar and Sutherland until 1684 . The extirpation of wolves in Ireland followed a similar course , with the last wolf believed to have been killed in 1786 . A wolf bounty was introduced in Sweden in 1647 , after the extermination of moose and reindeer forced wolves to feed on livestock . The Sami extirpated wolves in northern Sweden in organized drives . By 1960 , few wolves remained in Sweden , because of the use of snowmobiles in hunting them , with the last specimen being killed in 1966 . The gray wolf was exterminated in Denmark in 1772 and Norway 's last wolf was killed in 1973 . The species was decimated in 20th century Finland , despite regular dispersals from Russia . The gray wolf was only present in the eastern and northern parts of Finland by 1900 , though its numbers increased after World War II . 
 In Central Europe , wolves were dramatically reduced in number during the early nineteenth century , because of organized hunts and reductions in ungulate populations . In Bavaria , the last wolf was killed in 1847 , and had disappeared from the Rhine regions by 1899 and largely disappeared in Switzerland before the end of the nineteenth century . In 1934 , Nazi Germany became the first state in modern history to place the wolf under protection , though the species was already extirpated in Germany at this point . The last free @-@ living wolf to be killed on the soil of present @-@ day Germany before 1945 was the so @-@ called " Tiger of <unk> " , which was shot near Hoyerswerda , Lusatia ( then Lower Silesia ) in 1904 . Today , wolves have returned to the area . Wolf hunting in France was first institutionalized by Charlemagne between 800 – 813 , when he established the <unk> , a special corps of wolf hunters . The <unk> was abolished after the French Revolution in 1789 , but was re @-@ established in 1814 . In 1883 , up to 1 @,@ 386 wolves were killed , with many more by poison . 
 In Eastern Europe , wolves were never fully exterminated , because of the area 's contiguity with Asia and its large forested areas . However , Eastern European wolf populations were reduced to very low numbers by the late nineteenth century . Wolves were extirpated in Slovakia during the first decade of the twentieth century and , by the mid @-@ twentieth century , could only be found in a few forested areas in eastern Poland . Wolves in the eastern Balkans benefitted from the region 's contiguity with the former Soviet Union and large areas of plains , mountains and farmlands . Wolves in Hungary occurred in only half the country around the start of the 20th century , and were largely restricted to the Carpathian Basin . Wolf populations in Romania remained largely substantial , with an average of 2 @,@ 800 wolves being killed annually out of a population of 4 @,@ 600 from 1955 – 1965 . An all @-@ time low was reached in 1967 , when the population was reduced to 1 @,@ 550 animals . The extermination of wolves in Bulgaria was relatively recent , as a previous population of about 1 @,@ 000 animals in 1955 was reduced to about 100 – 200 in 1964 . In Greece , the species disappeared from the southern Peloponnese in 1930 . Despite periods of intense hunting during the eighteenth century , wolves never disappeared in the western Balkans , from Albania to the former Yugoslavia . Organized persecution of wolves began in Yugoslavia in 1923 , with the setting up of the Wolf Extermination Committee ( WEC ) in <unk> , Slovenia . The WEC was successful in reducing wolf numbers in the Dinaric Alps . 
 In Southern Europe , wolf extermination was not as complete as in Northern Europe , because of greater cultural tolerance of the species . Wolf populations only began declining in the Iberian Peninsula in the early 19th @-@ century , and was reduced by a half of its original size by 1900 . Wolf bounties were regularly paid in Italy as late as 1950 . Wolves were exterminated in the alps by 1800 , and numbered only 100 by 1973 , inhabiting only 3 – 5 % of their former Italian range . 
 = = = = Recovery = = = = 
 The recovery of European wolf populations began after the 1950s , when traditional pastoral and rural economies declined and thus removed the need to heavily persecute wolves . By the 1980s , small and isolated wolf populations expanded in the wake of decreased human density in rural areas and the recovery of wild prey populations . 
 The gray wolf has been fully protected in Italy since 1976 , and now holds a population of over 1 @,@ 269 @-@ 1 @,@ 800 . Italian wolves entered France 's <unk> National Park in 1993 , and at least fifty wolves were discovered in the western Alps in 2000 . By 2013 the 250 wolves in the Western Alps imposed a significant burden on traditional sheep and goat husbandry with a loss of over 5 @,@ 000 animals in 2012 . There are approximately 2 @,@ 000 wolves inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula , of which 150 reside in northeastern Portugal . In Spain , the species occurs in Galicia , Leon , and Asturias . Although hundreds of Iberian wolves are illegally killed annually , the population has expanded south across the river Duero and east to the Asturias and Pyrenees Mountains . 
 In 1978 , wolves began <unk> central Sweden after a twelve @-@ year absence , and have since expanded into southern Norway . As of 2005 , the total number of Swedish and Norwegian wolves is estimated to be at least one hundred , including eleven breeding pairs . The gray wolf is fully protected in Sweden and partially controlled in Norway . The Scandinavian wolf populations owe their continued existence to neighbouring Finland 's contiguity with the Republic of Karelia , which houses a large population of wolves . Wolves in Finland are protected only in the southern third of the country , and can be hunted in other areas during specific seasons , though poaching remains common , with 90 % of young wolf deaths being due to human predation , and the number of wolves killed exceeds the number of hunting licenses , in some areas by a factor of two . Furthermore , the decline in the moose populations has reduced the wolf 's food supply . Since 2011 , Netherlands , Belgium and Denmark have also reported wolf sightings presumably by natural migration from adjacent countries . 
 Wolf populations in Poland have increased to about 800 – 900 individuals since being classified as a game species in 1976 . Poland plays a fundamental role in providing routes of expansion into neighbouring Central European countries . In the east , its range overlaps with populations in Lithuania , Belorussia , Ukraine , and Slovakia . A population in western Poland expanded into eastern Germany and in 2000 the first pups were born on German territory . In 2012 , an estimated 14 wolf packs were living in Germany ( mostly in the east ) and a pack with pups has been sighted within 15 miles of Berlin . The gray wolf is protected in Slovakia , though an exception is made for wolves killing livestock . A few Slovakian wolves disperse into the Czech Republic , where they are afforded full protection . Wolves in Slovakia , Ukraine and Croatia may disperse into Hungary , where the lack of cover hinders the buildup of an autonomous population . Although wolves have special status in Hungary , they may be hunted with a year @-@ round permit if they cause problems . 
 Romania has a large population of wolves , numbering 2 @,@ 500 animals . The wolf has been a protected animal in Romania since 1996 , although the law is not enforced . The number of wolves in Albania and Macedonia is largely unknown , despite the importance the two countries have in linking wolf populations from Greece to those of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia . Although protected , sometimes wolves are still illegally killed in Greece , and their future is uncertain . Wolf numbers have declined in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1986 , while the species is fully protected in neighbouring Croatia and Slovenia .

 During the 19th century , gray wolves were widespread in many parts of the Holy Land east and west of the Jordan River . However , they decreased considerably in number between 1964 and 1980 , largely because of persecution by farmers . The species was not considered common in northern and central Saudi Arabia during the 19th century , with most early publications involving animals either from southwestern Asir , northern rocky areas bordering Jordan , or areas surrounding Riyadh . 
 The gray wolf 's range in the Soviet Union encompassed nearly the entire territory of the country , being absent only on the <unk> Islands , Franz @-@ Josef Land , Severnaya Zemlya , and the <unk> , Commander and <unk> Islands . The species was exterminated twice in Crimea , once after the Russian Civil War , and again after World War II . Following the two world wars , Soviet wolf populations peaked twice . 30 @,@ 000 wolves were harvested annually out of a population of 200 @,@ 000 during the 1940s , with 40 @,@ 000 – 50 @,@ 000 harvested during peak years . Soviet wolf populations reached a low around 1970 , disappearing over much of European Russia . The population increased again by 1980 to about 75 @,@ 000 , with 32 @,@ 000 being killed in 1979 . Wolf populations in northern inner Mongolia declined during the 1940s , primarily because of poaching of gazelles , the wolf 's main prey . In British @-@ ruled India , wolves were heavily persecuted because of their attacks on sheep , goats and children . In 1876 , 2 @,@ 825 wolves were <unk> in the North @-@ Western Provinces ( NWP ) and Bihar . By the 1920s , wolf extermination remained a priority in the NWP and Awadh . Overall , over 100 @,@ 000 wolves were killed for bounties in British India between 1871 and 1916 . 
 Wolves in Japan became extinct during the Meiji restoration period , an extermination known as <unk> no <unk> . The wolf was deemed a threat to ranching , which the Meiji government promoted at the time , and targeted via a bounty system and a direct chemical extermination campaign inspired by the similar contemporary American campaign . The last Japanese wolf was a male killed on January 23 , 1905 near <unk> ( now called Higashi <unk> ) . The now extinct Japanese wolves were descended from large Siberian wolves , which colonized the Korean Peninsula and Japan , before it separated from mainland Asia , 20 @,@ 000 years ago during the Pleistocene . During the Holocene , the Tsugaru Strait widened and isolated Honshu from Hokkaidō , thus causing climatic changes leading to the extinction of most large bodied ungulates inhabiting the archipelago . Japanese wolves likely underwent a process of island dwarfism 7 @,@ 000 – 13 @,@ 000 years ago in response to these climatological and ecological pressures . C. l. <unk> ( formerly native to Hokkaidō ) was significantly larger than its southern cousin C. l. <unk> , as it inhabited higher elevations and had access to larger prey , as well as a continuing genetic interaction with dispersing wolves from Siberia .

 There is little reliable data on the status of wolves in the Middle East , save for those in Israel and Saudi Arabia , though their numbers appear to be stable , and are likely to remain so . Israel 's conservation policies and effective law enforcement maintain a moderately sized wolf population , which radiates into neighbouring countries , while Saudi Arabia has vast tracts of desert , where about 300 – 600 wolves live undisturbed . The wolf survives throughout most of its historical range in Saudi Arabia , probably because of a lack of pastoralism and abundant human waste . Turkey may play an important role in maintaining wolves in the region , because of its contiguity with Central Asia . The mountains of Turkey have served as a refuge for the few wolves remaining in Syria . A small wolf population occurs in the Golan Heights , and is well protected by the military activities there . Wolves living in the southern Negev desert are contiguous with populations living in the Egyptian Sinai and Jordan . Throughout the Middle East , the species is only protected in Israel . Elsewhere , it can be hunted year @-@ round by Bedouins . 
 Little is known of current wolf populations in Iran , which once occurred throughout the country in low densities during the mid @-@ 1970s . The northern regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan are important strongholds for the wolf . It has been estimated that there are about 300 wolves in approximately 60 @,@ 000 km2 ( 23 @,@ 000 sq mi ) of Jammu and Kashmir in northern India , and 50 more in Himachal Pradesh . Overall , India supports about 800 @-@ 3 @,@ 000 wolves , scattered among several remnant populations . Although protected since 1972 , Indian wolves are classed as endangered , with many populations lingering in low numbers or living in areas increasingly used by humans . Although present in Nepal and Bhutan , there is no information of wolves occurring there . 
 Wolf populations throughout Northern and Central Asia are largely unknown , but are estimated in the hundreds of thousands based on annual harvests . Since the fall of the Soviet Union , continent @-@ wide extermination of wolves has ceased , and wolf populations have increased to about 25 @,@ 000 – 30 @,@ 000 animals throughout the former Soviet Union .

 Originally , the gray wolf occupied all of North America north of about 20 ° N. It occurred all over the mainland , save for the southeastern United States , California west of the Sierra Nevada , and the tropical and subtropical areas of Mexico . Large continental islands occupied by wolves included Newfoundland , Vancouver Island , southeastern Alaskan islands , and throughout the Arctic Archipelago and Greenland . While Lohr and Ballard postulated that the gray wolf had never been present on Prince Edward Island , analysis of references to the Island ’ s native fauna in unpublished and published historical records has found that gray wolves were resident there at the time of the first French settlement in 1720 . In his 6 November 1721 letter to the French Minister of the Marine , Louis Denys de La Ronde reported that the Island was home to wolves “ of a prodigious size ” , and sent a wolf pelt back to France to substantiate his claim . As the Island was cleared for settlement , the gray wolf population may have been extirpated , or relocated to the mainland across the winter ice : the few subsequent wolf reports date from the mid @-@ nineteenth century and describe the creatures as transient visitors from across the Northumberland Strait . 
 The decline of North American wolf populations coincided with increasing human populations and the expansion of agriculture . By the start of the 20th century , the species had almost disappeared from the eastern USA , excepting some areas of the Appalachians and the northwestern Great Lakes Region . In Canada , the gray wolf was extirpated in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia between 1870 and 1921 , and in Newfoundland around 1911 . It vanished from the southern regions of Quebec and Ontario between 1850 and 1900 . The gray wolf 's decline in the prairies began with the extermination of the American bison and other ungulates in the 1860s – 70s . From 1900 – 1930 , the gray wolf was virtually eliminated from the western USA and adjoining parts of Canada , because of intensive predator control programs aimed at eradicating the species . The gray wolf was exterminated by federal and state governments from all of the USA by 1960 , except in Alaska and northern Minnesota . The decline in North American wolf populations was reversed from the 1930s to the early 1950s , particularly in southwestern Canada , because of expanding ungulate populations resulting from improved regulation of big game hunting . This increase triggered a resumption of wolf control in western and northern Canada . Thousands of wolves were killed from the early 1950s to the early 1960s , mostly because of poisoning . This campaign was halted and wolf populations increased again by the mid @-@ 1970s .

 The species ' modern range in North America is mostly confined to Alaska and Canada , with populations also occurring in northern Minnesota , northern Wisconsin and Michigan 's Upper Peninsula , and portions of Washington , Idaho , northern Oregon , and Montana . A functional wolf population should exist in California by 2024 according to estimates by state wildlife officials . Canadian wolves began to naturally re @-@ colonize northern Montana around Glacier National Park in 1979 , and the first wolf den in the western U.S. in over half a century was documented there in 1986 . The wolf population in northwest Montana initially grew as a result of natural reproduction and dispersal to about 48 wolves by the end of 1994 . From 1995 @-@ 1996 , wolves from Alberta and British Columbia were relocated to Yellowstone National Park and Idaho . In addition , the Mexican wolf ( Canis lupus baileyi ) was reintroduced to Arizona and New Mexico in 1998 . The gray wolf is found in approximately 80 % of its historical range in Canada , thus making it an important stronghold for the species . 
 Canada is home to about 52 @,@ 000 – 60 @,@ 000 wolves , whose legal status varies according to province and territory . First Nations residents may hunt wolves without restriction , and some provinces require licenses for residents to hunt wolves while others do not . In Alberta , wolves on private land may be baited and hunted by the landowner without requiring a license , and in some areas , wolf hunting bounty programs exist . Large @-@ scale wolf population control through poisoning , trapping and aerial hunting is also presently conducted by government @-@ mandated programs in order to support populations of endangered prey species such as woodland caribou . 
 In Alaska , the gray wolf population is estimated at 6 @,@ 000 – 7 @,@ 000 , and can be legally harvested during hunting and trapping seasons , with bag limits and other restrictions . As of 2002 , there are 250 wolves in 28 packs in Yellowstone , and 260 wolves in 25 packs in Idaho . The gray wolf received Endangered Species Act ( ESA ) protection in Minnesota , Wisconsin , and Michigan in 1974 , and was re @-@ classed from endangered to threatened in 2003 . <unk> Mexican wolves in Arizona and New Mexico are protected under the ESA and , as of late 2002 , number 28 individuals in eight packs . A female wolf shot in 2013 in Hart County , Kentucky by a hunter was the first gray wolf seen in Kentucky in modern times . DNA analysis by Fish and Wildlife laboratories showed genetic characteristics similar to those of wolves in the Great Lakes Region . 
 = = Diseases and parasites = = 
 = = = Viral and bacterial infections = = = 
 Viral diseases carried by wolves include rabies , canine distemper , canine parvovirus , infectious canine hepatitis , <unk> , and canine coronavirus . Wolves are a major host for rabies in Russia , Iran , Afghanistan , Iraq and India . In wolves , the incubation period is 8 – 21 days , and results in the host becoming agitated , deserting its pack , and travelling up to 80 km a day , thus increasing the risk of infecting other wolves . Infected wolves do not show any fear of humans , with most documented wolf attacks on people being attributed to rabid animals . Although canine distemper is lethal in dogs , it has not been recorded to kill wolves , except in Canada and Alaska . The canine parvovirus , which causes death by dehydration , electrolyte imbalance , and <unk> shock or sepsis , is largely survivable in wolves , but can be lethal to pups . Wolves may catch infectious canine hepatitis from dogs , though there are no records of wolves dying from it . <unk> has been recorded only once in wolves , and likely doesn 't cause serious illness or death , though it may alter feeding behaviors . The canine coronavirus has been recorded in Alaskan wolves , with infections being most prevalent in winter months . 
 Bacterial diseases carried by wolves include brucellosis , lyme disease , leptospirosis , tularemia , bovine tuberculosis , listeriosis , anthrax and foot and mouth disease . Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer . While adult wolves tend not to show any clinical signs , it can severely weaken the pups of infected females . Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves , it does not appear to have any significant effect on wolf populations . <unk> can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine , and can cause fever , anorexia , vomiting , anemia , hematuria , <unk> , and death . Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness , probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste . Wolves may catch tularemia from <unk> prey , though its effect on wolves is unknown . Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves , it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada . 
 = = = Parasitic infections = = = 
 Wolves carry ectoparasites and endoparasites , with wolves in the former Soviet Union having been recorded to carry at least 50 species . Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects , though the effects may become more serious in sick or malnourished specimens . Parasitic infection in wolves is of particular concern to people , as wolves can spread them to dogs , which in turn can carry the parasites to humans . In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas , the parasites can be spread to livestock . 
 Wolves are often infested with a variety of arthropod <unk> , including fleas , ticks , lice , and mites . The most harmful to wolves , particularly pups , is Sarcoptes scabiei ( or mange mite ) , though they rarely develop full blown mange , unlike foxes . Lice , such as Trichodectes canis , may cause sickness in wolves , but rarely death . Ticks of the genus Ixodes can infect wolves with Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever . The tick <unk> pictus also infests wolves . Other ectoparasites include biting lice , sucking lice and the fleas Pulex irritans and Ctenocephalides canis . 
 Endoparasites known to infect wolves include protozoans and helminths ( flukes , tapeworms , roundworms and thorny @-@ headed worms ) . Of 30 @,@ 000 protozoan species , only a few have been recorded to infect wolves : Isospora , Toxoplasma , <unk> , <unk> , and Giardia . Wolves may carry <unk> caninum , which is of particular concern to farmers , as the disease can be spread to livestock , with infected animals being 3 – 13 times more likely to miscarry than those not infected . Among flukes , the most common in North American wolves is Alaria , which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves . Upon reaching maturity , Alaria migrates to the wolf 's intestine , but harms it little . Metorchis conjunctus , which enters wolves through eating fish , infects the wolf 's liver or gall bladder , causing liver disease , inflammation of the pancreas , and emaciation . Most other fluke species reside in the wolf 's intestine , though <unk> <unk> lives in the lungs . Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves , as their primary hosts are ungulates , small mammals , and fish , which wolves feed upon . Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves , though this depends on the number and size of the parasites , and the sensitivity of the host . Symptoms often include constipation , toxic and allergic reactions , irritation of the intestinal mucosa , and malnutrition . Infections by the tapeworm <unk> <unk> in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities , as wolves can shed <unk> eggs in their feces onto grazing areas . Wolves can carry over 30 roundworm species , though most roundworm infections appear benign , depending on the number of worms and the age of the host . <unk> caninum attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host 's blood , and can cause <unk> anemia , emaciation , diarrhea , and possibly death . Toxocara canis , a hookworm known to infect wolf pups in utero , can cause intestinal irritation , bloating , vomiting , and diarrhea . Wolves may catch <unk> <unk> from minks , which infects the kidneys , and can grow to lengths of 100 cm . D. <unk> causes the complete destruction of the kidney 's functional tissue , and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected . Wolves can tolerate low levels of <unk> immitis for many years without showing any ill effects , though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and congestive <unk> . Wolves probably become infected with Trichinella spiralis by eating infected ungulates . Although T. spiralis isn 't known to produce clinical signs in wolves , it can cause emaciation , salivation , and crippling muscle pains in dogs . Thorny @-@ headed worms rarely infect wolves , though three species have been identified in Russian wolves : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .

 = = = = In folklore , religion and mythology = = = = 
 The wolf is a common motif in the foundational mythologies and cosmologies of peoples throughout Eurasia and North America ( corresponding to the historical extent of the habitat of the gray wolf ) . The obvious attribute of the wolf is its nature of a predator , and correspondingly it is strongly associated with danger and destruction , making it the symbol of the warrior on one hand , and that of the devil on the other . The modern trope of the Big Bad Wolf is a development of this . The wolf holds great importance in the cultures and religions of the nomadic peoples , both of the Eurasian steppe and of the North American Plains . In many cultures , the identification of the warrior with the wolf ( totemism ) gave rise to the notion of <unk> , the mythical or ritual identification of man and wolf . 
 = = = = In fable and literature = = = = 
 Aesop featured wolves in several of his fables , playing on the concerns of Ancient Greece 's settled , sheep @-@ herding world . His most famous is the fable of The Boy Who Cried Wolf , which is directed at those who knowingly raise false alarms , and from which the idiomatic phrase " to cry wolf " is derived . Some of his other fables concentrate on maintaining the trust between shepherds and guard dogs in their vigilance against wolves , as well as anxieties over the close relationship between wolves and dogs . Although Aesop used wolves to warn , criticize and <unk> about human behavior , his portrayals added to the wolf 's image as a deceitful and dangerous animal . <unk> the wolf , a character first appearing in the 12th @-@ century Latin poem <unk> , is a major character in the Reynard Cycle , where he stands for the low nobility , whilst his adversary , Reynard the fox , represents the peasant hero . Although portrayed as loyal , honest and moral , <unk> is forever the victim of Reynard 's wit and cruelty , often dying at the end of each story . The tale of Little Red Riding Hood , first written in 1697 by Charles Perrault , is largely considered to have had more influence than any other source of literature in forging the wolf 's negative reputation in the western world . The wolf in this story is portrayed as a potential rapist , capable of imitating human speech . The hunting of wolves , and their attacks on humans and livestock feature prominently in Russian literature , and are included in the works of Tolstoy , Chekhov , Nekrasov , Bunin , <unk> , and others . Tolstoy 's War and Peace and Chekhov 's Peasants both feature scenes in which wolves are hunted with hounds and <unk> . Farley Mowat 's largely fictional 1963 memoir Never Cry Wolf was the first positive portrayal of wolves in popular literature , and is largely considered to be the most popular book on wolves , having been adapted into a Hollywood film and taught in several schools decades after its publication . Although credited with having changed popular perceptions on wolves by portraying them as loving , cooperative and noble , it has been criticized for its idealization of wolves and its factual inaccuracies . 
 = = = = In heraldry and symbolism = = = = 
 The wolf is a frequent charge in English armory . It is illustrated as a supporter on the shields of Lord Welby , Rendel , and Viscount Wolseley , and can be found on the coat of arms of Lovett and the vast majority of the Wilsons and Lows . The demi @-@ wolf is a common crest , appearing in the arms and crests of members of many families , including that of the <unk> , whose crest depicts a demi @-@ wolf holding a crown in its paws , in reference to the assistance the family gave to Charles II during the battle of Worcester . Wolf heads are common in Scottish heraldry , particularly in the coats of Clan Robertson and Skene . The wolf is the most common animal in Spanish heraldry , and is often depicted as carrying a lamb in its mouth , or across its back . The wolf is featured on the flags of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation , the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin and the Pawnee . In modern times , the wolf is widely used as an emblem for military and paramilitary groups . It is the unofficial symbol of the <unk> , and serves as the logo of the Turkish Grey Wolves . During the Yugoslav Wars , several Serb paramilitary units adopted the wolf as their symbol , including the White Wolves and the Wolves of Vučjak .

 = = = = Wolf predation on livestock = = = = 
 Livestock <unk> has been one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves , and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation : as well as causing economic losses , the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers , and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found . Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programmes or state insurance . Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves , as they have evolved under constant human protection , and are thus unable to defend themselves very well . Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted : in Eurasia , a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock , while such incidences are rare in North America , where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored . The majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period , with untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation . The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep ( Europe ) , domestic reindeer ( northern Scandinavia ) , goats ( India ) , horses ( Mongolia ) , cattle and turkeys ( North America ) . The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species : most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death , while turkeys , sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus . Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing , though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures . In some cases , wolves do not need to physically attack livestock to negatively affect it : the stress livestock experiences in being vigilant for wolves may result in miscarriages , weight loss and a decrease in meat quality . 
 = = = = Conflicts with dogs = = = = 
 Being the most abundant carnivores , feral and free @-@ ranging dogs have the greatest potential to compete with wolves . A review of the studies in the competitive effects of dogs on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves . Competition would favor the wolf , which is known to kill dogs , however wolves tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted , giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs . 
 Wolves kill dogs on occasion , with some wolf populations relying on dogs as an important food source . In Croatia , wolves kill more dogs than sheep , and wolves in Russia appear to limit stray dog populations . Wolves may display unusually bold behavior when attacking dogs accompanied by people , sometimes ignoring nearby humans . Wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests . Wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered a major problem in Scandinavia and Wisconsin . The most frequently killed hunting breeds in Scandinavia are harriers , with older animals being most at risk , likely because they are less timid than younger animals , and react to the presence of wolves differently . Large hunting dogs such as Swedish <unk> are more likely to survive wolf attacks because of their better ability to defend themselves . 
 Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low , it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs . In many cultures , there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs that can be seen as family members or working team members . The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations . 
 Dogs that are employed to guard sheep help to mitigate human – wolf conflicts , and are often proposed as one of the non @-@ lethal tools in the conservation of wolves . Shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive , but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what is to the wolf ambiguous behaviors , such as barking , social greeting , invitation to play or aggression . The historical use of shepherd dogs across Eurasia has been effective against wolf predation , especially when confining sheep in the presence of several livestock @-@ guarding dogs . However , shepherd dogs are sometimes killed by wolves . 
 = = = = Wolf predation on humans = = = = 
 The fear of wolves has been pervasive in many societies , though humans are not part of the wolf 's natural prey . How wolves react to humans depends largely on their prior experience with people : wolves lacking any negative experience of humans , or which are food conditioned , may show little fear of people . Although wolves may react aggressively under provocation , such attacks are mostly limited to quick bites on extremities , and the attacks are not pressed . Predatory attacks ( attacks by wolves treating humans as food ) may be preceded by a long period of habituation , in which wolves gradually lose their fear of humans . The victims are repeatedly bitten on the head and face , and are then dragged off and consumed , unless the wolves are driven off . Such attacks typically occur only locally , and do not stop until the wolves involved are eliminated . Predatory attacks can occur at any time of the year , with a peak in the June – August period , when the chances of people entering forested areas ( for livestock grazing or berry and mushroom picking ) increase , though cases of non @-@ rabid wolf attacks in winter have been recorded in Belarus , Kirov and Irkutsk oblasts , Karelia and Ukraine . Also , wolves with pups experience greater food stresses during this period . The majority of victims of predatory wolf attacks are children under the age of 18 and , in the rare cases where adults are killed , the victims are almost always women . Cases of rabid wolves are low when compared to other species , as wolves do not serve as primary reservoirs of the disease , but can be infected by animals such as dogs , jackals and foxes . Incidents of rabies in wolves are very rare in North America , though numerous in the eastern Mediterranean , Middle East and Central Asia . Wolves apparently develop the " furious " phase of rabies to a very high degree which , coupled with their size and strength , makes rabid wolves perhaps the most dangerous of rabid animals , with bites from rabid wolves being 15 times more dangerous than those of rabid dogs . Rabid wolves usually act alone , travelling large distances and often biting large numbers of people and domestic animals . Most rabid wolf attacks occur in the spring and autumn periods . Unlike with predatory attacks , the victims of rabid wolves are not eaten , and the attacks generally only occur on a single day . Also , the victims are chosen at random , though the majority of cases involve adult men . In the half @-@ century up to 2002 , there were eight fatal attacks in Europe and Russia , and more than 200 in south Asia . Between 2005 @-@ 2010 , two people were killed in North America . 
 = = = = Human predation on wolves = = = = 
 Wolves are notoriously difficult to hunt because of their elusiveness , their sharp senses , their high endurance in the chase and ability to quickly incapacitate and kill hunting dogs . Historically , many methods have been devised to hunt wolves , including the killing of spring @-@ born litters in their dens , coursing with dogs ( usually combinations of sighthounds , bloodhounds and fox terriers ) , poisoning with strychnine , and foothold and <unk> traps . A popular method of wolf hunting in Russia involves trapping a pack within a small area by encircling it with <unk> poles carrying a human scent . This method relies heavily on the wolf 's fear of human scents , though it can lose its effectiveness when wolves become accustomed to the smell . Some hunters are able to lure wolves by imitating their calls . In Kazakhstan and Mongolia , wolves are traditionally hunted with eagles and falcons , though this practise is declining , as experienced falconers are becoming few in number . Shooting wolves from aircraft is highly effective , as it allows greater visibility of wolves than hunting on the ground , though this method is controversial , as it allows wolves little chance to escape or defend themselves . Some dog breeds like the Borzoi wolfhound , the Irish wolfhound , or the Kyrgyz <unk> have been specifically selected for wolf hunting . 
 = = = As pets and working animals = = = 
 Wild wolves are sometimes kept as exotic pets , and in some rarer occasions , as working animals . Although closely related to domesticated dogs , wolves do not show the same <unk> as dogs in living alongside humans , and generally , much more work is required in order to obtain the same amount of reliability . Wolves also need much more space than dogs , about 10 to 15 square miles so they can exercise . 
 = Irataba = 
 Irataba ( Mohave : <unk> tav [ <unk> ͡ <unk> tav ] , also known as Yara tav , <unk> : va , <unk> ; c . 1814 – 1874 ) was a leader of the Mohave Nation , known for his role as a mediator between his people and the United States . He was born near the Colorado River in present @-@ day Arizona . Irataba was a renowned orator and one of the first Mohave to speak English , a skill he used to develop relations with the United States . Early records mention his large physical size and gentle demeanor . Irataba first encountered European Americans in 1851 , when he assisted the Sitgreaves Expedition . In 1854 , he met Amiel Whipple , then leading an expedition crossing the Colorado . Several Mohave aided the group , and Irataba agreed to escort them through the territory of the Paiute to the Old Spanish Trail , which would take them to southern California . He later helped and protected other expeditions , earning him a reputation among whites as the most important native leader in the region . 
 Against Irataba 's advice , in 1858 Mohave warriors attacked the first emigrant wagon train to use Beale 's Wagon Road through Mohave country . As a result , the U.S. War Department sent a detachment under Colonel William Hoffman to pacify the tribe . Following a series of confrontations known as the Mohave War , Hoffman succeeded in dominating the natives , and demanded that they allow the passage of settlers through their territory . To ensure compliance , Fort Mohave was constructed near the site of the battle in April 1859 . Hoffman also imprisoned several Mohave leaders . Having been an advocate for friendly relations with the whites , Irataba became the nation 's Aha macave yaltanack , an elected , as opposed to hereditary , leader . 
 As a result of his many interactions with U.S. officials and settlers , Irataba was invited to Washington , D.C. , in 1864 , for an official meeting with members of the U.S. military and its government , including President Abraham Lincoln . In doing so , he became the first Native American from the Southwest to meet an American president . He received considerable attention during his tours of the U.S. capital , and of New York City and Philadelphia , where he was given gifts , including a silver @-@ headed cane from Lincoln . Upon his return he negotiated the creation of the Colorado River Indian Reservation , which caused a split in the Mohave Nation when he led several hundred of his supporters to the Colorado River valley . The majority of the Mohave preferred to remain in their ancestral homelands near Fort Mohave and under the leadership of their hereditary leader , Homoseh quahote , who was less enthusiastic about direct collaboration with whites . As leader of the Colorado River band of Mohave , Irataba encouraged peaceful relations with whites , served as a mediator between the warring tribes in the area , and during his later years continued to lead the Mohave in their ongoing conflicts with the Paiute and Chemehuevi . 
 Some consider Irataba a great leader who championed peace , but others feel he should have done more to defend the Mohave way of life . The Irataba Society , a non @-@ profit charity run by the Colorado River Indian Tribes , was established in 1970 in Parker , Arizona , where a sports venue , Irataba Hall , is also named after him . In 2002 , the US Bureau of Land Management designated 32 @,@ 745 acres ( 132 @.@ 51 km2 ) in the Eldorado Mountains as Ireteba Peaks Wilderness . In March 2015 , Mohave Tribal chairman Dennis Patch credited Irataba with ensuring that " the Mohaves stayed on land they had lived on since time immemorial . " 
 = = Background = = 
 Irataba 's name , also rendered as Ireteba , Yara tav , <unk> , <unk> : va , and <unk> , derives from the Mohave language phrase <unk> tav , which means " beautiful bird " . He was born into the <unk> , or Sun Fire clan of the Mohave Nation c . 1814 . He lived near a rock formation that gave its name to Needles , south of where the Grand Canyon empties into the Mohave Canyon in present @-@ day Arizona , near the Nevada and California border . The Mohave lived in houses along the riverbank in the Mohave Valley , during winter in half @-@ buried dwellings built with cottonwood logs and <unk> covered in earth , and in the summer in open @-@ air flat @-@ roofed houses called <unk> . 
 In the mid @-@ 19th century , the Mohave were composed of three geographical groups ; Irataba was the hereditary leader of the <unk> Pah group , who lived near the east bank of the Colorado River and occupied the central portion of the Mohave Valley . Mohave government consisted of a loose system of hereditary clan leaders with a head of the entire nation . They were often involved in conflicts with the Chemehuevi , Paiute , and Maricopa peoples . Irataba was a member of the Mohave warrior society called kwanami , who led groups of warriors in battle and were dedicated to defending their lands and people . 
 Little is known of Irataba 's family relations , except for the name of his son <unk> <unk> , and his nephews Qolho qorau ( Irataba 's sister 's son who succeeded him as leader ) and <unk> . Olive Oatman , who lived with the Mohave for five years , later stated that Irataba was the brother of the former chief , presumably Cairook , with whom Irataba clearly had a close relation . One anecdotal description states that Irataba had several wives , among them a Hualapai woman who had been taken as a captive and who is also described as having a young son . He also had at least one daughter , the mother of his granddaughter <unk> who was interviewed in the 1950s . She stated that Irataba had wanted to leave his land deeds and medals to his brother 's sons , but that they were eventually lost . 
 In contemporary accounts Irataba was described as an eloquent speaker , and linguist Leanne Hinton suggests that he was among the first Mohave people to become fluent in English , which he learned through his many interactions with Anglo @-@ Americans . Like many Mohave men , Irataba was very tall , particularly by 19th @-@ century standards ; the United States Army estimated his height at 6 feet 4 inches ( 193 cm ) in 1861 . American author Albert S. Evans , writing in The Overland Monthly , referred to him as " the old desert giant " . Edward Carlson , a soldier based at Fort Mohave who knew Irataba well in the 1860s , described him as having a powerful frame , but also a " very gentle " and " kind ... demeanor " . 
 Irataba lived through a tumultuous period of Mohave history where the people went from being a politically independent nation to coming under the political control of the United States , and the events surrounding his role in these encounters are well documented . Most historical sources for the life of Irataba come from descriptions by white explorers or government agents with whom he interacted , or from contemporary newspapers that reported on his visits to the East Coast and California , and on the conflicts in Arizona territory . Some Mohave versions of the events also exist : in the early 20th century anthropologist A. L. Kroeber interviewed Jo Nelson ( Mohave : Chooksa homar ) , a Mohave man who participated in many of the events and knew Irataba personally ; another version was told to ethnographer George Devereux by Irataba 's granddaughter <unk> , and versions recounted by members of the Fort Mohave band of Mohave , the descendants of Homoseh quahote , were recorded by ethnographer Lorraine Sherer during the 1950s and 1960s . 
 = = Contact with emigrants and explorers = = 
 Irataba assisted Captain Lorenzo Sitgreaves during his 1851 exploration of the Colorado . On March 19 , 1851 , most of the Oatman family , traveling by wagon train in what is now Arizona , were killed by what are believed to have been members of the <unk> band of Western Yavapai . The Yavapai killed seven members of the family , but spared the lives of 14 @-@ year @-@ old Olive Oatman and her 7 @-@ year @-@ old sister , Mary Ann . After a year with the Yavapai , the girls were sold to the Mohave , and adopted into the <unk> clan where they lived with the family of a Mohave man called Tokwatha ( Musk Melon ) . Mary Ann died two years later , and Olive remained with the Mohave until February 22 , 1856 , when Tokwatha , having been warned that having a white girl among them might be seen as an offense by whites , brought her to Fort Yuma carpenter Henry Grinnell , releasing her in return for two horses and some blankets and beads . 
 = = = Whipple Expedition = = = 
 On February 23 , 1854 , Irataba , Cairook , and other Mohave people encountered an expedition led by military officers Amiel Whipple and J.C. Ives , as the group approached the Colorado en route to California . Whipple and his men counted six hundred Mohave gathered near their camp , trading corn , beans , squash , and wheat for beads and calico . By the end of their commerce , the party had purchased six bushels of corn and two hundred pounds of flour . The Mohave played a traditional game played with a hoop and pole , and the two groups entertained themselves with target practice , the Mohave using bows and arrows and the whites firing pistols and rifles . When the expedition had difficulty crossing the Colorado on February 27 , several Mohave jumped into the water and helped salvage the supplies . 
 Irataba and Cairook agreed to escort the group across the territory of the Paiute to the Old Spanish Trail that would take them to southern California . German artist Balduin Möllhausen accompanied the Whipple expedition , and made drawings of several Mohave , including Irataba . Möllhausen 's drawings were featured in Ives ' 1861 congressional report , making Irataba " among the first named likenesses of California Indians ever published " . 
 = = = Ives Expedition = = = 
 In February 1858 , Ives returned to the area in a paddle steamer named Explorer . He was leading an expedition up the Colorado from the south , and he wanted Irataba to guide them . The Mohave gave permission to navigate the river , and Cairook , Irataba , and a 16 @-@ year @-@ old Mohave boy named <unk> joined them . Möllhausen again accompanied the expedition , and was impressed with the Mohave guides , later noting Irataba 's enthusiastic handshake and lamenting that their only form of communication was sign language . He also noted that Irataba and the Mohave readily began wearing European clothes given to them by members of the expedition , and showed great interest in smoking tobacco . Aside from the friendship shown to him by Irataba and Cairook , Ives noted that the Mohave appeared less friendly than on earlier occasions , a change that he attributed to their contact with Mormons , who were in conflict with the US and had succeeded in converting some Mohave . 
 Irataba guided the party into the Mohave Canyon , indicating the location of rapids and advising the Explorer 's pilot of convenient places to anchor while camping for the night . When they reached the entrance to the Black Canyon of the Colorado , the ship crashed against a submerged rock , throwing several men overboard , dislodging the boiler , and damaging the wheelhouse . Using their skiff , the crew towed the Explorer to the shore , where they camped for three days while repairing the vessel . The expedition had relied on beans and corn provided by the Mohave during the previous weeks ; as their supplies dwindled they grew increasingly anxious about the arrival of a resupply pack train from Fort Yuma . Irataba volunteered to hike towards the Mohave Valley to try to locate the supplies that had been requested several days earlier . He also warned that the expedition was being watched by Paiutes . 
 When Irataba returned he informed Ives that he would not venture any deeper into the territory of the <unk> , but agreed to help them locate friendly guides in the region before parting company . Irataba was reluctant to venture into the canyon because he feared the party would be ambushed by Paiutes aligned with Mormons . After enlisting three Hualapai guides , Irataba prepared to take his leave from the expedition and return to the Mohave community . On April 4 , the Mohave received payment for their services ; Möllhausen described the exchange : " Lieutenant Ives informed Irataba that he had been authorized by the ' Great Grandfather in Washington ' to give him two mules ... for his loyalty and his trustworthiness so that he could take his possessions and those of his companions more conveniently to his home valley . " The next morning , as they were preparing to leave : " Irataba was visibly moved ... and in his sincere eyes expressed so much honesty and loyalty as can only be found in an unspoiled nature ... I maintain that there was not one in our expedition who did not feel a certain sadness to see this huge man with ... a harmless soul leave . " 
 = = Mohave War and aftermath = = 
 Following their experiences with the Sitgreaves and Whipple expeditions , and encounters with Mormons and the soldiers at Fort Yuma , the Mohave were aware that whites were immigrating to the region in increasing numbers . It was difficult for the Mohave to predict the behavior of the arriving whites , some of whom , like Whipple , were amiably disposed towards them , whereas others such as the Mormons were hostile . The kwanami were divided on how the situation should be approached ; some advocated an aggressive posture , denying whites all passage through their territory , but others , including Irataba , preferred a peaceful approach , or even an alliance with them that could put the Mohave in a stronger position relative to their traditional enemies the Paiute , Chemehuevi , and Walapai . 
 On September 1 , 1857 , a joint force of Mohave and Quechan warriors launched a major attack with hundreds of warriors on a Maricopa village close to Maricopa Wells , Arizona , on the Gila river . The Battle of Pima Butte was described by a group of white mail carriers who witnessed it . They stated that the battle was fought mostly with clubs , as well as bows and arrows , and that probably more than 100 warriors died , most of them from the attacking party . It is unknown whether Irataba participated in the attack , but given his status as kwanami , it is likely that he did . The battle has been described as the last major battle involving only Native American nations . This defeat put the Mohave on the defensive , wary of the possibility that whites would take this moment of weakness as an opportunity to begin settling on tribal lands . 
 = = = Rose – <unk> Party attack = = = 
 In October 1857 , an expedition led by Edward Fitzgerald Beale was tasked with establishing a trade route along the 35th parallel from Fort Smith , Arkansas , to Los Angeles , California . From Fort Smith , his journey continued through Fort Defiance , Arizona , before crossing the Colorado near Needles , California . This route became known as Beale 's Wagon Road , and the location where Beale crossed the river as Beale 's Crossing . Beale 's journal and subsequent report to the United States Secretary of War did not mention any problems with Irataba and the Mohave , but an assistant named Humphrey Stacy recorded that the Mohave had prevented Beale from traveling downriver . 
 In 1858 , the Rose – <unk> Party comprising at least a hundred settlers with wagons and a large herd of cattle , was the first emigrant train to venture onto Beale 's Wagon Road . Upon entering Mohave territory the settlers started cutting down cottonwood trees , which were an important resource for the Mohave . The most warlike of the <unk> organized an attack on the party , and drove away and slaughtered many of the party 's cattle . On August 30 , three hundred Mohave warriors attacked the emigrants but were repelled , with one member of the party killed in battle and eleven wounded . Another family who were not with the main party during the attack were killed in an event that has often been blamed on the Mohave , but which in Colonel William Hoffman 's opinion was more likely carried out by a band of Walapai , along with seven renegade Mohave . The emigrants killed seventeen Mohave warriors . The incident was widely publicized in the media and labeled " a massacre " , scaring many white Californians who feared being cut off from the eastern US by hostile natives , and it motivated the War Department to quickly subjugate the tribe . 
 Irataba was away at Fort Yuma during the attack on the settlers , and upon hearing of it he scolded the Mohave . Chooksa homar participated in the events and reported that Irataba told the warriors , " I hear you fought , though I told you not to . And you will have war again : I know it . You used to fight the Maricopa . I want to go [ to Phoenix ] to see the Maricopa and tell them : ' The Mohave will not come any more to attack you ' . " Irataba , weary of the constant fighting and worried that further conflicts with neighboring tribes would draw more attention from the US soldiers , organized a peace expedition to the Maricopa , settling the ancient disputes between the two peoples . 
 = = = Conflict with the US army = = = 
 When news of the attack reached California , the US War Department decided to establish a military fort at Beale 's Crossing to keep the Mohave under control and secure white travelers safe passage through Mohave lands . On December 26 , 1858 , Hoffman and fifty dragoons from Fort Tejon were dispatched to cross the desert and confront the Mohave . Irataba attempted to arrange a peaceful meeting , but Hoffman ordered his troops to fire on the warriors , who counterattacked and repelled the force . He returned in April 1859 , by way of Fort Yuma , with four companies of the 6th Infantry Regiment . When they arrived at Beale 's Crossing , the Mohave decided against attacking the army of five hundred soldiers . On April 23 , at Hoffman 's request , he and his officers met with several hundred Mohave warriors and their leaders . The indigenous leaders included Cairook , Irataba , Homoseh quahote ( also called Seck @-@ a @-@ hoot and <unk> hota ) , and Pascual , leader of the Quechan . During the meeting the Mohave were surrounded by armed soldiers who prevented them from leaving . 
 Hoffman gave the Mohave a choice between war and peace , and he demanded that they agree to never again harm white settlers along the wagon trail . He also declared that , as punishment , the Mohave were required to surrender as hostages a member of each clan and three warriors who had taken part in the attack . Hoffman demanded that the chief who had ordered the attack on the settlers offer himself up as a hostage . According to Chooksa homar , the chief who had ordered the attack was Homoseh quahote , who was reluctant to give himself up . Cairook offered himself in his place , along with eight others , including Tokwatha , Irataba 's son <unk> <unk> , and Irataba 's nephews Qolho qorau , and <unk> . Other hostages were named <unk> ' <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> @-@ <unk> . They were transported in the river steamer General Jessup to Fort Yuma . Many soldiers remained to begin construction on the Beale 's Crossing fort , which was named Fort Mohave . Although Irataba visited the garrison several times and argued for their release , the hostages were held for more than a year . On June 21 , 1859 , Cairook and one other captive were killed by soldiers while attempting to escape their incarceration . Most of the other Mohave captives escaped . 
 In July 1861 , the commander of Fort Mohave , Major Lewis Armistead , ordered soldiers to fire into a group of Mohave who he suspected of having attacked a mail carrier and slaughtered his mule . The Mohave did not respond violently to the attack , but Armistead decided to punish them for harassing the mail party . He arrived at Irataba 's ranch where a group of Mohave boys were planting beans , and from a hidden position he shot one of the planters , killing him . This attack prompted an assault on Armistead 's detachment , who from an advantageous position on the high ground were able to repel the Mohave , killing many of them in a battle that lasted most of the day . Armistead 's report of the assault of Irataba 's ranch reported 23 dead Mohave warriors , but the Mohave remember a much higher number of casualties , including women and children killed by the soldiers . Sherer speculated that , given that 50 soldiers fired around 10 shots each , the casualty count could have been much higher than reported . The attack on Irataba 's ranch is remembered by the Mohave as " the first and last battle with the Federal Troops . " 
 = = As Aha macave yaltanack = = 
 After Cairook 's death , whites living near the Colorado River began to view Irataba as the main leader of the Mohave . He had become Aha macave yaltanack ( leader of the Mohave Nation ) or <unk> ( leader elected by the people ) ; " yaltanack " is Mohave for " leader " , and " <unk> " means " head of a group " . Homoseh quahote was a hereditary leader of the Malika clan ( " the understanding people " ) , and the position of head of the Mohave was traditionally inherited only by someone from that clan . Because Irataba was of the <unk> pah , in order for him to become the leader of the Mohave Nation , Homoseh quahote had to step down so Irataba , as an elected leader , could take his place . 
 Despite the accepted English translations , the words yaltanack and <unk> do not mean a " ruler " or " boss " . Devereux describes Mohave government as " one of the least understood segments of Mohave culture " , and notes that while white officials " tended to act on the assumption that Indian chiefs exercised absolute authority " , as an elected leader Irataba was " primarily a servant of the tribe " . 
 By the mid @-@ 1860s a deep rift had developed between Irataba , who was proactive in cooperating with white settlers , and Homoseh quahote , who passively tolerated but did not approve of white encroachment on Mohave lands . Irataba was Aha macave yaltanack of the Mohave from 1861 to 1866 , but from 1867 to 1869 opinions differ , and by 1870 US government correspondence suggests that Homoseh quahote had succeeded him as leader of the Fort Mohave group . 
 = = Mining ventures = = 
 In 1862 , Irataba acted as a guide for the Walker Party Exploration , gold prospectors led by Joseph R. Walker and including Jack Swilling , who later founded Phoenix , Arizona . Irataba brought them to a river that he called <unk> , later named the Hassayampa River , where they found plentiful gold . Arizona 's first mining district was established there the following year , which led to the founding of Prescott , Arizona soon afterward . Relations between settlers and the Mohave were positive during this period , but as emigration increased , gold seekers founded a town nearby named La Paz , stirring fear among settlers of a native uprising against further encroachment on Mohave land . The following year a group of soldiers from Fort Mohave discovered an area between Needles , Fort Mohave , and the Colorado River that was abundant in copper ore . The parcel was named Irataba Mining District , and within the year a mining company had been formed to work it . A small mining town named Irataba City was established on a bluff two miles below Fort Mohave . 
 = = Travels = = 
 In the early 1860s , Irataba worked with prospectors as a guide . One of them was John Moss , an experienced prospector whom Irataba had shown the location of a gold mine in the Mojave desert , which Moss later sold . Moss suggested Irataba be invited to Washington so that he could see firsthand the United States ' military might . In November 1863 , Irataba traveled with Moss to San Pedro , Los Angeles , where they boarded the steamship Senator , bound for San Francisco . In San Francisco , he stayed at the Occidental Hotel and created a storm as he walked down Jackson Street , dressed in clothing typical of European Americans , which Irataba soon preferred to traditional Mohave clothing . The press documented his every movement and wrote extensively about his physical size and strong features . On December 2 , 1863 , the Daily Evening Bulletin described Irataba as a large man , " granitic in appearance as one of the Lower Coast mountains , with ... a lower jaw massive enough to crush nuts or crush quartz . " 
 In January 1864 they sailed for the Isthmus of Panama on board the Orizaba , then traveled onwards to New York City . Upon Irataba 's arrival in New York , Harper 's Weekly described him as " the finest specimen of unadulterated aboriginal on this continent " . Here Irataba exchanged his suit and sombrero for the uniform and regalia of a major general , including a bright yellow sash , a gold badge encrusted with precious stones , and a medal with the inscription , " Irataba , Chief of the Mohaves , Arizona Territory " . In February , when The New York Times asked him to explain the nature of his visit , he replied : " to see where so many pale faces come from " . In New York he met with the former Mohave captive Olive Oatman , and the two conversed in Mohave . Irataba told Oatman that her Mohave adoptive sister Topeka , to whom she had grown very close , still missed her and hoped she would return . Oatman described the encounter as a meeting between friends . 
 Irataba moved on to Philadelphia and Washington , D.C. , where he earned great acclaim ; government officials and military officers lavished him with gifts of medals , swords , and photographs . In Washington he met with President Abraham Lincoln , who gave him a silver @-@ headed cane . He was the first Native American from the Southwest to meet an American president . The tour ended in April , when he and Moss sailed to California , again by way of Panama , and made their way back to Beale 's Crossing from Los Angeles by wagon . 
 Upon Irataba 's return from Washington D.C. , he met with the Mohave while dressed in his major general 's uniform , with medals . He wore a European @-@ style hat and carried a long Japanese sword , and he told the Mohave about all the things he had seen . He tried to convince them that peace with the United States was in their best interests , and that war against them was futile , stressing their dominant military capabilities . Many Mohave were skeptical of his reports , and reacted with disbelief . 
 = = Colorado River Indian Reservation = = 
 The completion of Fort Mohave began the process of military subjugation of the Mohave , and the next step was the establishment of reservations . In 1863 , Charles <unk> Poston , the first Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the Arizona Territory , called a conference between the Chemehuevi and Irataba 's faction of the Mohave , in which he convinced them to form an alliance with the US against the Apache . The treaty was never ratified by the US Congress but formed an important step in establishing friendly relations between the Mohave and the US government following the military campaigns and the establishment of Fort Mohave . 
 Poston promoted the idea of establishing a reservation in the southern portion of Mohave country . Many Mohave opposed the proposed location and instead argued for a smaller parcel further north in the Mohave Valley , which had more fertile land . With Irataba and an engineer , Poston traveled down the Colorado River to survey a location . In August 1864 the post commander at Fort Mohave , Captain Charles <unk> , stated that Irataba was against the proposed location . In September 1864 , Poston gave the impression that Irataba was in favor of it . In a letter to General Richard C. Drum , <unk> reported that Irataba and four Mohave leaders were unhappy with how Poston was handling the situation : 
 Mr. Poston had marked out a reservation for the Mojave Indians in the upper part of the La Paz valley on the East side of the Colorado River ... Iratabu says this reservation is covered with sand and unfit for cultivation and the Indians are opposed to giving up their good lands in the Mojave Valley and moving to it ... Iratabu says if he can have the valley below the Fort Mojave reserved for the home of the Indians , he is willing to give up all claims to lands on other parts of the river , and bring his Indians from La Paz and other points to this valley ... I have full confidence in the friendship of Iratabu towards white men , but not in his tribe , if troubles with any other Indians should occur , while he has more influence over them than any other chief , his control over them is not complete , and they are as likely to lead him ( as he is them ) . 
 Faced with Irataba 's disagreement , Poston promised that the US government would assist the Mohave with installing an irrigation system at the Colorado that would make most of the reservation arable . This apparently convinced Irataba , who traveled to the Colorado River Valley with about 800 people , almost a fifth of the entire Mohave Nation . General James Henry Carleton thought a reservation was unnecessary , and engineer Herman Ehrenberg disagreed with Poston 's proposed location on the basis that the soil was too alkaline for farming , the need for irrigation too great , and the task of raising the river too insurmountable . Nonetheless , on March 3 , 1865 , Congress established the Colorado River Indian Reservation at Poston 's proposed location . Ehrenberg 's concerns proved valid , and neither Poston nor any subsequent US authority was willing to dedicate the considerable resources required to make the location suitable for farming . The reservation was established without a treaty having been established between the Mohave and the US government . The boundaries were expanded and clarified by executive orders issued by President Grant in 1873 , 1874 and 1867 . 
 Most of the Mohave refused to leave their ancestral homelands for the reservation , but Irataba 's conviction that the reservation was their best option marked the beginning of a rift between his group and those who stayed behind to follow Homoseh quahote , the nation 's hereditary leader . According to an eyewitness account by Chooksa homar , Irataba explained his decision to move : 
 " You get angry sometimes ; I know you are brave men and think you can beat anybody . You thought you could beat the whites : you said so . I told you you could not ; the whites have beaten all tribes ; all are friends to them now . You did not listen to what I said when I told you that . You did what you thought , and many have got killed . If the soldiers come , you cannot resist them . You did not know that , but now you know it . The country down river from here , which we took away from another tribe [ the <unk> ] , I will live there . Those of you who want to go on fighting can stay here . I do not want to and will leave you . " 
 As the promised irrigation assistance was not immediately forthcoming , the first year at the reservation brought a drought that made it necessary for the Mohave to request food assistance . In 1867 , Irataba and the Mohave began to build an irrigation canal , digging by hand a ditch that ran for 9 miles ( 14 km ) . A report by a US official visiting the reservation in 1870 recorded that attempts by the Mohave at agricultural cultivation on the site were restricted to an area of not more than 40 acres ( 16 ha ) . 
 = = Later years = = 
 Irataba continued to lead the Colorado River band of Mohave during the 1860s . He pursued peaceful relations with the surrounding tribes and cooperated actively with US authorities . He also helped the Yavapai and Walapai in ongoing conflicts with Paiutes and Chemehuevi . 
 In March 1865 , Irataba and the Mohave defeated the Chemehuevi after their allies , the Paiutes , killed two Mohave women . The Mohave pushed the Chemehuevi off their traditional territory and into the California desert , but they soon returned . To avoid fighting a two @-@ front war , Irataba attacked the Chemehuevi first , then turned his attention to the Paiutes , who were planning an attack on the Mohave farm and granary on the Colorado 's Cottonwood Island . During a subsequent battle with the Chemehuevi in October 1865 , Irataba was taken prisoner while wearing his major general 's uniform . According to a contemporary news report based on second hand accounts from white travelers , the captors feared that killing him would invite repercussions from the soldiers stationed at Fort Mohave , so they instead stripped him naked and sent him home badly beaten . In the Mohave account of the events as told by Chooksa homar , Irataba surrendered in an effort to make peace with the Chemehuevi , and offered his uniform to their chief as a gesture of peace . In 1867 , a treaty signed by Irataba and the Chemehuevi leader Pan <unk> restored peaceful relations between the two nations . 
 Irataba also welcomed bands of Yavapai onto the reservation after they had been subject to massacres by US troops , or suffered starvation due to having been driven from their lands . The meager resources of the reservation proved unable to sustain the additional population and eventually the Yavapai had to leave . Irataba frequently served as a mediator between Yavapai and Walapai who had become embroiled in conflicts with the US army , and participated in peace parlays . In 1871 – 72 , General George Crook came to the Mohave reservation looking for a group of Yavapai thought to be responsible for the Wickenburg Massacre , and Irataba had no choice but to turn the war party over to the army . He traveled to the trial proceedings at Fort Date Creek , where he was instructed to hand tobacco to the Yavapai he believed to be responsible , as a way for him to testify against them without their realizing it . As soldiers attempted to arrest the men that Irataba identified , fighting broke out and one of the Yavapai leaders , <unk> , and his brother were shot . Despite having been shot twice and stabbed with a bayonet , <unk> survived and escaped to organize the <unk> Yavapai in resistance against the US army . The Yavapai felt betrayed by Irataba , and plotted to kill him in revenge , but were eventually persuaded that he was not the one who had turned them over to Crook . 
 The Colorado River band of Mohave never replaced Irataba ; he was their leader when he died at their reservation on May 3 or 4 , 1874 . His cause of death is unknown , but smallpox and natural causes are both cited . The Mohave grieved deeply ; Irataba 's cremation and the rituals of mourning were reported in newspapers as far away as Omaha , Nebraska . Irataba was succeeded as leader on the Colorado Reservation by his nephew , Qolho qorau of the <unk> clan , who upheld his uncle 's policies . 
 = = Legacy and influence = = 
 In 1966 , Sherer commented regarding Irataba 's legacy amongst the Mohave : " Estimation of his position in Mojave history from the Mojave viewpoint differs . To some he is an heroic figure , to others he was a white collaborator who did not stand up for Mojave rights . From the standpoint of white men who were conquering a wilderness , he was indeed the Mojave who worked unswervingly for peace . " 
 Irataba 's influence as a leader may even have left its mark on the Mohave language . A list of Mohave words that he dictated to an anthropologist during his visit in Washington shows that he was among the first Mohave speakers to shift the sounds [ s ] and [ ʂ ] ( similar to sh as in " shack " ) to [ θ ] ( th as in " thick " ) and [ s ] , respectively . By the late 19th century all Mohave speakers had adopted this change . Linguist Leanne Hinton has suggested that this may be due in part to Irataba 's influence , both because he was a prestigious leader whose ways of speaking may have been emulated by other Mohave , and also because when he led the Mohave onto the reservation the old distinctions between dialect groups were erased through dialect leveling , making new changes spread quickly through the community . 
 The Irataba Society , a non @-@ profit charity run by the Colorado River Indian Tribes , was established in Parker , Arizona , in 1970 . The charity holds an annual pow wow or National Indian Days celebration . Irataba Hall , a sports venue in Parker , is also named after him . In 2002 , the US Bureau of Land Management designated 32 @,@ 745 acres ( 13 @,@ 251 ha ) of the Eldorado Mountains , contained largely within the Lake Mead National Recreation Area , as Ireteba Peaks Wilderness . 
 In March 2015 , the Colorado River Indian Tribes celebrated the sesquicentennial history of their reservation with a weekend @-@ long event that included cultural activities and a parade . Speakers at the event stressed the important role that Irataba 's strong leadership played in establishing and preserving the reservation , and the continuing need for Native leaders to protect native language and culture . Tribal chairman Dennis Patch commented : " Some people would think we 're lucky , as we have this river and 220 @,@ 000 acre feet of water ... But we have had great leaders , like Chief Irataba . He made sure the Mohaves stayed on land they had lived on since time immemorial . " Former <unk> Museum Director Dr. Michael <unk> stated , " Irataba understood the Mohave people would need to keep fighting to keep what they had . " He noted that the Colorado River Indian Reservation " is unique in American history in that they have not lost any land " . 
 = Christopher Smart 's asylum confinement = 
 The English poet Christopher Smart ( 1722 – 1771 ) was confined to mental asylums from May 1757 until January 1763 . Smart was admitted into St Luke 's Hospital for Lunatics , Bethnal Green , London , on 6 May 1757 . He was taken there by his father @-@ in @-@ law , John Newbery , although he may have been confined in a private madhouse before then . While in St Luke 's he wrote Jubilate Agno and A Song to David , the poems considered to be his greatest works . Although many of his contemporaries agreed that Smart was " mad " , accounts of his condition and its ramifications varied , and some felt that he had been committed unfairly . 
 Smart was diagnosed as " incurable " while at St Luke 's , and when they ran out of funds for his care he was moved to Mr. Potter 's asylum . All that is known of his years of confinement is that he wrote poetry . Smart 's isolation led him to abandon the poetic genres of the 18th century that had marked his earlier work and to write religious poetry such as Jubilate Agno ( " Rejoice in the Lamb " ) . His asylum poetry reveals a desire for " unmediated revelation " , and it is possible that the self @-@ evaluation found in his poetry represents an expression of evangelical Christianity . 
 Late 18th @-@ century critics felt that Smart 's madness justified them in ignoring his A Song to David , but during the following century Robert Browning and his contemporaries considered his condition to be the source of his genius . It was not until the 20th century , with the rediscovery of Jubilate Agno ( not published until 1939 ) , that critics reconsidered Smart 's case and began to see him as a revolutionary poet , the possible target of a plot by his father @-@ in @-@ law , a publisher , to silence him . 
 = = Background = = 
 Christopher Smart was an English poet who was confined to asylums during a time of debate about the nature of madness and its treatment . During the 18th century , madness was " both held to reveal inner truth and condemned to silence and exclusion as something unintelligible by reason , and therefore threatening to society and to humanity " . It was commonly held to be an incurable affliction whose sufferers should be isolated from society . Physician William Battie — who later treated Smart — wrote : 
 [ we ] find that Madness is , contrary to the opinion of some unthinking persons , as manageable as many other distempers , which are equally dreadful and obstinate , and yet are not looked upon as incurable , and that such unhappy objects ought by no means to be abandoned , much less shut up in loathsome prisons as criminals or nuisances to the society . 
 In particular , Battie defined madness as " deluded imagination " . However , he was attacked by other physicians , such as John Monro , who worked at Bethlem Hospital . In his Remarks on Dr. Battie 's Treatise on Madness , Monro explained that those who were mad had the correct perceptions , but that they lacked the ability to judge properly . Although Monro promoted ideas of reform , his suggested treatment — beating patients — was as harsh on patients as Battie 's preferred option , of completely isolating patients from society . 
 In 1758 , Battie and others argued that those deemed " mad " were abused under the British asylum system , and they pushed for parliamentary action . Battie 's Treatise on Madness emphasised the problems of treating the hospitals as tourist attractions and the punitive measures taken against patients . The arguments of Battie and others resulted in the passage of the Act for Regulating Private <unk> ( 1774 ) , but were too late to help Smart . 
 Modern critics , however , have a more cynical view of the 18th @-@ century use of the term " madness " when diagnosing patients ; psychiatrist Thomas Szasz viewed the idea of madness as arbitrary and unnatural . Agreeing with Szasz 's position , philosopher Michel Foucault emphasised that asylums were used in the 18th century to attack dissenting views and that the idea of madness was a cultural fear held by the British public , rather than a legitimate medical condition . In particular , Foucault considered the 18th century a time of " great confinement " . This description is consistent with Smart 's 1760s writings on the subject in which , according to Thomas Keymer , " the category of madness is insistently <unk> , and made to seem little more than the invention of a society strategically concerned to discredit all utterances or conduct that threatens its interests and norms . " 
 18th century treatment of inpatients was simple : they were to be fed daily a light diet of bread , oatmeal , some meat or cheese , and a little amount of beer , which were inadequate in meeting daily nutritional needs ; they were denied contact with outsiders , including family members ; and they would be denied access to that which was deemed to be the cause of their madness ( these causes ranged from alcohol and food to working outside ) . If their actions appeared " afresh and without assignable cause " , then their condition would be labelled as " original " madness and deemed incurable . An institution like St Luke 's , run by Battie , held both " curable " and " incurable " patients . There were few spots available for patients to receive free treatment , and many were released after a year to make room for new admittances .

 During the 1740s , Smart published many poems while a student at Pembroke College , Cambridge . He eventually left the university in 1749 to devote his time to poetry . In 1750 , Smart started to familiarise himself with Grub Street , London 's writing district , and met John Newbery , a publisher . Soon after , Newbery began publishing Smart 's works in various magazines and in collections , including Poems on Several Occasions ( 1752 ) . Of these works , Smart was known for his Seatonian Prize @-@ winning poems , his pastoral poem The Hop @-@ Garden , and his mock epic The Hilliad . In 1752 , Smart married Newbery 's daughter , Anna Maria Carnan , and had two daughters with her by 1754 . Although many of Smart 's works were published between 1753 and 1755 , he had little money to provide for his family . At the end of 1755 , he finished a translation of the works of Horace , but even that provided little income . Having no other choices , Smart signed a 99 @-@ year @-@ long contract in November 1755 to produce a weekly paper entitled The Universal Visiter or Monthly <unk> , and the strain of writing caused Smart 's health to deteriorate . 
 On 5 June 1756 , Smart 's father @-@ in @-@ law Newbery published , without permission , Smart 's Hymn to the Supreme Being , a poem which thanked God for recovery from an illness of some kind , possibly a " disturbed mental state " . During the illness , Smart was possibly confined to Newbery 's home and unable to write or be socially active . Out of sympathy for Smart , many of his friends , including writer and critic Samuel Johnson , began to write in the Universal Visiter to fulfill Smart 's contractual obligation to produce content for the magazine . The publication of Hymn to the Supreme Being marked the beginning of Smart 's obsession with religion and eventual confinement for madness because he began praying " without ceasing " . 
 Smart 's behaviour was probably influenced by St Paul 's command in the First Epistle to the Thessalonians to " Pray without ceasing " and William Law 's The Spirit of Prayer , which argues that a constant state of prayer will establish a connection with God . Smart began by praying at regular intervals but this slowly deteriorated into irregular praying in which he would interrupt his friends ' activities and call them into the street to pray with him . These calls for public prayer continued until an incident that Smart later described in Jubilate Agno : " For I blessed God in St James 's Park till I routed all the company ... For the officers of the peace are at variance with me , and the watchman smites me with his staff " ( Jubilate Agno B 90 – 91 ) . 
 Christopher Hunter , Smart 's biographer and nephew , described the situation : 
 Though the fortune as well as the constitution of Mr. Smart required the utmost care , he was equally negligent in the management of both , and his various and repeated embarrassments acting upon an imagination uncommonly fervid , produced temporary <unk> of mind ; which at last were attended with paroxysms so violent and continued as to render confinement necessary . 
 Hunter reports that Samuel Johnson visited Smart during the latter 's confinement , and it was Johnson that , " on the first approaches of Mr Smart 's malady , wrote several papers for a periodical publication in which that gentleman was concerned . " However , at no time did Smart ever believe himself to be insane ; these meetings began before Smart was ever put into asylum because he still contributed , although not as significantly , to the Universal Visiter . In joking about writing for the Universal Visiter , Johnson claimed : " for poor Smart , while he was mad , not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write ... I hoped his wits would return to him . Mine returned to me , and I wrote in ' the Universal Visitor ' no longer . " 
 There are other possibilities beyond madness or religious fervor that may have led to Smart 's confinement : Newbery may have used the imprisonment of his son @-@ in @-@ law as leverage to control the publication of Smart 's work and as a warning to others who worked for him not to cross him . Another theory suggests Smart 's actions were a result of alcohol , and had nothing to do with a mental imbalance . However , Smart may have been imprisoned for embarrassing his father @-@ in @-@ law in some way , which could have resulted from an incident in which Smart drank . Hester Thrale reinforced this latter possibility when she claimed that Smart 's " religious fervor " tended to coincide with times that Smart was intoxicated . Smart 's own testimony that he " blessed God in St. James 's Park till I routed all the company " ( Jubilate Agno B 90 – 91 ) as representing his religious madness is equally dismissed as resulting from drinking , as he was known for pulling pranks and the Board of Green Cloth , the government body that controlled St James 's Park , would treat most disturbances in the park as resulting from madness . If Smart was placed into the asylum as a result of actions at St James 's , he would not have been the only one , since records show that the Board of Green Cloth was responsible for admitting sixteen people to Bethlem Hospital for " frenzy " at St James 's Park during the century prior to Smart being placed in St Luke 's . 
 The specific events of Smart 's confinement are unknown . He may have been in a private madhouse before St Luke 's and later moved from St Luke 's to Mr Potter 's asylum until his release . At St Luke 's , he transitioned from being " curable " to " incurable " , and was moved to Mr Potter 's asylum for monetary reasons . During Smart 's confinement time , his wife Anna left and took the children with her to Ireland . There is no record that he ever saw her again . His isolation led him into writing religious poetry , and he abandoned the traditional genres of the 18th century that marked his earlier poetry when he wrote Jubilate Agno . 
 During his time in asylum , Smart busied himself with a daily ritual of writing poetry ; these lyric fragments eventually formed his Jubilate Agno and A Song to David . Smart might have turned to writing poetry as a way to focus the mind or as self @-@ therapy . Although 20th @-@ century critics debate whether his new poetic self @-@ examination represents an expression of evangelical Christianity , his poetry during his isolation does show a desire for " unmediated revelation " from God . There is an " inner light " that serves as a focal point for Smart and his poems written during his confinement , and that inner light connects him to the Christian God . 
 = = = St Luke 's Hospital for Lunatics = = = 
 Few details are known about Smart 's time at St Luke 's Hospital for Lunatics . He was admitted to St Luke 's on 6 May 1757 as a " <unk> Patient " . It is possible that Smart was confined at Newbery 's behest over old debts and a poor relationship that existed between the two ; Newbery had previously mocked Smart 's immorality in A Collection of Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children six Foot High . Regardless of Newbery 's exact reasons , there is evidence suggesting that Newbery 's admittance of Smart into the mental asylum was not based on madness . To have Smart admitted , Newbery probably provided a small bribe , although bribes were against St Luke 's policy . 
 There is little information about Smart 's condition during his stay at St Luke 's , possibly because Battie 's denied his patients from being visited , including by their own family members . One of the few records that survive of Smart 's time at St Luke 's was an entry in St Luke 's Minute Book , which read : 
 12 May 1758 
 Dr. Battie having acquainted this Committee that Christopher Smart ( who was admitted on the 6th day of May 1757 ) continues disordered in his Senses notwithstanding he has been admitted into this Hospital above 12 Calendar Months and from the present Circumstances of his Case there is not <unk> reason to expect his speedy Recovery And he being brought up and examined . Ordered . That he be discharged and that Notice be sent to his Securities to take him away . 
 During Smart 's confinement at St Luke 's , not even other doctors were allowed to see Smart unless they had received personal permission from Battie . It was improbable that Smart could have left the asylum without being released by Battie . Even if Smart would have attempted to obtain release via legal means , the rules for <unk> release would have been almost impossible to follow based on the system that Battie had in place , which isolated the individual from all contact . Eventually , Smart was deemed " incurable " and would not have been released by the hospital but for its lack of funds . 
 = = = Mr Potter 's madhouse = = = 
 After being released from St Luke 's , Smart was taken to a private madhouse . Elizabeth <unk> , Smart 's daughter , was brought to see her father and stated that he was " committed by Mr Newbery to the care of a Mr Potter who kept a private house at Bethnal Green " . She described her experience as being held in a " small neat parlour " . However , Mr Potter 's private madhouse was not " homely " , and Smart 's treatments were far worse , as he describes : " For they work on me with their harping @-@ irons , which is a barbarous instrument , because I am more unguarded than others " ( Jubilate Agno B 129 ) . Smart was left alone for four years , except for his cat Jeoffry and the occasional <unk> who would come to see those deemed mad . Piozzi described Smart 's general situation : " He was both a wit and a scholar , and visited as such while under confinement for <unk> . " It is very possible that he felt " homeless " during his confinement and surely felt that he was in a " limbo ... between public and private space " from being watched by outsiders . 
 In London , only a few of his works were still being published , but the proceeds were taken by Newbery . However , Smart did get to see published a collection of his work under the pseudonym " Mrs Midnight " titled Mrs. Midnight 's Orations ; and other Select Pieces : as they were spoken at the Oratory in the Hay @-@ Market , London . Smart did not profit from the work , but he was able to see at least some of his previous work being printed again . Smart , according to his 20th @-@ century biographer Arthur Sherbo , had only " his God and his poetry " . A few of his loyal friends eventually grew tired of the treatment Smart received and freed him from Mr Potter 's . 
 = = = Release = = = 
 There is little information about how and why Smart was released from asylum , but his daughter claimed : " He grew better , and some misjudging friends who misconstrued Mr Newbery 's great kindness in placing him under necessary & salutary restriction which might possibly have eventually wrought a cure , invited him to dinner and he returned to his confinement no more . " What is known about the actual events is that John Sherratt , Christopher Smart 's friend , believed that Smart 's confinement was unfair and wanted to negotiate Smart 's release . In January 1763 , he met with a parliamentary committee to discuss the issue of individuals falsely imprisoned and abuses that they would receive in asylums . In particular , Sherratt argued that many were admitted for habitual intoxication , which undermined Battie 's and other asylum keeper 's reputations . A finding by the parliamentary committee released 27 January 1763 bolstered Sherratt 's chances to release Smart . To those around him , Smart appeared perfectly sane , and he was most likely released because of legislation concurrently being passed in parliament advocating for a reform to patient care . Smart left the asylum on 30 January 1763 with Sherratt . 
 Upon leaving asylum , Smart took the manuscripts of A Song to David , many translations of Psalms , and Jubilate Agno . A Song to David was published on 6 April 1763 . Harsh reviews followed which mocked Smart 's time in the asylum instead of dealing with the poems . Jubilate Agno stayed in manuscript form and passed into the hands of the friends of William Cowper , a poet also placed into asylum and Smart 's contemporary , when they investigated the concept of " madness " . The work stayed in private holdings until it was rediscovered in the 20th century by William Stead . It was not published until 1939 when it was printed with the title Rejoice in the Lamb : A Song from Bedlam .

 Samuel Johnson 's biographer James Boswell described a moment when Charles Burney inquired of his friend Johnson of Smart 's state . Johnson used the term " madness " to comment on the state of society before explaining to Burney that Smart 's actions that were deemed symptoms of madness were actually reasonable : 
 Madness frequently discovers itself merely by unnecessary deviation from the usual mode of the world . My poor friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind , by falling upon his knees , and saying his prayers in the street , or in any other unusual place . Now although , rationally speaking , it is greater madness not to pray at all , than to pray as Smart did , I am afraid there are so many who do not pray , that their understanding is not called in question . 
 Concerning this unfortunate poet , Christopher Smart , who was confined in a mad @-@ house , he had , at another time , the following conversation with Dr [ Charles ] Burney : – Burney . ' How does poor Smart do , Sir ; is he likely to recover ? ' Johnson . ' It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease ; for he grows fat upon it . ' Burney . ' Perhaps , Sir , that may be from want of exercise . ' Johnson . ' No , Sir ; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have , for he digs in the garden . Indeed , before his confinement , he used for exercise to walk to the ale @-@ house ; but he was carried back again . I did not think he ought to be shut up . His infirmities are not noxious to society . He insisted on people praying with him ; and I 'd as <unk> pray with Kit [ = Christopher ] Smart as any one else . Another charge was that he did not love clean linen ; and I have no passion for it . ' – Johnson continued . ' Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labour ; but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable , more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it.' 
 In an article printed in the Gentleman 's Magazine , Hester Piozzi , Smart 's acquaintance and Johnson 's close friend , argued that in many aspects Smart appears sane : 
 In every other transaction of life no man 's wits could be more regular than those of Smart , for this prevalence of one idea <unk> keeping the first place in his head had in no sense , except in what immediately related to itself , perverted his judgement at all ; his opinions were unchanged as before , nor did he seem more likely to fall into a state of distraction than any other man ; less so , perhaps , as he calmed every violent start of passion by prayer . 
 Beyond Smart 's circle of friends , few were willing to dismiss claims that Smart was affected by madness . Most contemporary literary critics knew of Smart 's time in asylum and , upon publication of his A Song to David , called attention to aspects of the poem which they could use to claim that Smart was still " mad " . The view was widely held , and the poet William Mason wrote to Thomas Gray , " I have seen his Song to David & from thence conclude him as mad as ever . " 
 = = = 19th century = = = 
 It was a century before a positive twist was put on Christopher Smart 's time in asylum ; the Victorian poet Robert Browning argued that A Song to David was great because Smart was mad at the time . In his poem <unk> ( 1887 ) , Browning claimed : 
 Armed with this instance , have I diagnosed 
 Your case , my Christopher ? The man was sound 
 And sane at starting : all at once the ground 
 Gave way beneath his step 
 * * * * * 
 Then — as heaven were loth 
 To linger ; — let earth understand too well 
 How heaven at need can operate — off fell 
 The flame @-@ robe , and the <unk> man 
 <unk> sobriety , — as he began , 
 So did he end nor alter pace , not he ! 
 To Browning , Smart 's temporary madness was what allowed him to compose in A Song to David poetry similar to that of John Milton and John Keats . Christopher Smart , as Browning 's poem continued , 
 pierced the screen 
 <unk> thing and word , lit language straight from soul , — 
 Left no fine film @-@ flake on the naked coal 
 Live from the censer 
 Browning 's remarks brought about a later appreciation of A Song to David and Smart 's madness . A review of Browning 's <unk> claimed that Christopher Smart was " possessed by his subject ... and where there is true possession – where the fires of the poet 's imagination are not choked by self @-@ consciousness or by too much fuel from the intellect – <unk> , mannerism , and even conventional formulae are for the time ' burnt and purged away ' . " 
 The 19th @-@ century poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti emphasised the benefits of Smart 's madness and claimed that A Song to David was " the only great accomplished poem of the last century . " Two years later , Francis Palgrave continued the theme when he wrote that the Song exhibited " noble wildness and transitions from grandeur to tenderness , from Earth to Heaven " and that it was " unique in our Poetry . " Seven years after Palgrave , critic John Churton Collins agreed with Rossetti and Palgrave , but to a lesser extent , when he wrote , " This poem stands alone , the most extraordinary phenomenon , perhaps , in our literature , the one rapt strain in the poetry of the eighteenth century , the work of a poet who , though he produced much , has not produced elsewhere a single line which indicates the power here displayed . " 
 = = = 20th century and contemporary = = = 
 Twentieth @-@ century critics favoured the view that Smart suffered from some kind of mental distress when writing his poems . A review by " Mathews " titled " Thin Partitions " , in 30 March 1901 The Academy , claimed that : 
 Now Christopher Smart was a very beggarly poet of the eighteenth century [ ... ] but had not the smallest claim to rank with those great men beyond their common trade of poem . Kit Smart , in fact , though he wrote a pestilent deal of verse , could not write poetry — nor anything else [ ... ] Legally mad , that is ; for he appears to have been very mad in his senses , and a decent citizen out of them . He went mad — legally and medically — once , and nothing came out of it , perhaps because he was not mad enough . Then he went mad again and being duly shut up in Bedlam wrote one of the finest outbursts of lyric genius in the eighteenth century — perhaps the finest @-@ before the advent of Blake [ ... ] Smart regained his senses , and therewith his hopeless inability to write poetry . And he never did anything after . 
 In 1933 , A. E. Housman sided with Browning 's and Mathew 's interpretation and connected Smart 's madness with poetic genius in his lecture The Name and Nature of Poetry : " As matters actually stand , who are the English poets of that age in whom pre @-@ eminently one can hear and recognize the true poetic accent emerging clearly from the contemporary dialect ? These four : Collins , Christopher Smart , Cowper , and Blake . And what other characteristic had these four in common ? They were mad . " In 1994 , Branimir Rieger differed from Housman 's view by distancing Smart from the others when he argued that " Collins and Cowper pine as isolated individuals , guiltily aware of a vitality that is not finally human but divine . Smart soars beyond individuality to embrace that vitality , but at a cost of all human relationship . " 
 However , there are many that disagreed that Smart suffered from madness ; Edward Ainsworth and Charles Noyes , when discussing Smart 's Hymn to the Supreme Being , said , " The mind that composed this hymn was not deranged . Yet in the poem one sees the morbidly religious mind which , in disorder , was to produce the Jubilate Agno , and , with order restored , the Song to David . Additionally , they claimed that Smart 's 
 preternatural excitement to prayer seems to have been poor Smart 's only real mental aberration , unless his drunkenness be considered pathological . When his mind was removed entirely from the field of prayer , he was but little changed from his sane state . His powers of reason , though thus warped , were not taken from him , and he neither raved nor sank into mental lethargy . 
 Nevertheless , Ainsworth and Noyes were not completely sceptical about Smart 's diagnosis when they continued : " But when the desire to pray struck him , Smart abandoned what the world chose to call rationality . " 
 In 1960 , psychiatrist Russel Brain diagnosed Smart as suffering from <unk> or manic depression . Brain based his diagnosis on Smart 's own claims about how he felt , and he concluded that " in Smart 's case the mental illness was not the result of his drunkenness , but he drank because he was mentally unstable . " Arthur Sherbo , in 1967 , argued that " The nature of Smart 's madness is impossible to diagnose at this distance in time " and then argued that : 
 since Battie himself pronounced him <unk> , he must have been subject to hallucinations . Strong drink , taken often enough and in sufficient quantity , will have that effect , of course , but Battie , distinguishing between ' original ' and ' consequential ' madness [ ... ] would allow only that excessive drinking could ' become a very common , tho ' remoter cause of Madness . ' Others differed : John Ball in his Modern Practice of Physic , 1760 , lists ' anxiety of mind ' and too much ' strong vinous or spirituous liquors ' as ' antecedent causes ' of madness . Smart 's mania , however it manifested itself , and it usually manifested itself in loud public prayer , did not stem from drunkenness ; it was aggravated , however , by frequent recourse to the bottle . Ironically enough , as Mrs. Piozzi recognised , if Smart had prayed in the privacy of his home , all might have been well for him . 
 The possible religious component of Smart 's condition was taken up by 20th @-@ century critics as an explanation for why the 18th century saw Smart as mad . Laurence Binyon , in 1934 , believed that religion played a major role in how society viewed Smart : " Smart 's madness seems to have taken the form of a literal interpretation of the injunction Pray without ceasing . He embarrassed visitors by insisting on their joining him in his supplications [ ... ] Obsession with a fixed idea is a common form of insanity . But such obsessions are a mental imprisonment ; whereas the Song is unmistakably the expression of a great release . " Binyon 's idea was picked up by Sophia Blaydes , in 1966 , who pointed out that society was prejudiced against those who experienced enthusiasm , a strong spiritual connection to God . It was against religious prejudice that she argued , 
 The cause of Smart 's eclipse may be traced in part to a prejudice of the age , one which was founded in reason but developed in fear . There was one inescapable fact which hampered any clear perception of Smart 's work — he had been confined for madness . It was easier to use a difficult allusion or unusual image as evidence of madness than to interpret it . What could cause a fundamentally rational group of people to react so irrationally ? To some degree , it was the fear of ' enthusiasm ' . 
 In the 18th century , as Blaydes continued , the word changed from possessed by god to inspired to falsely inspired . The result of this change was that British society viewed enthusiasm as the enemy to both reason and social order . Thus , " Smart , the hack @-@ writer , would not have been greeted by a hostile audience , but Smart , the enthusiast , would have been condemned immediately . The result would be obvious : his past work , previously lauded , would be ignored , and his future work would receive immediate <unk> such was the history of Smart 's contemporary reputation . " In determining if Smart was really mad or not , Blaydes concluded , " in Smart 's day , any sign of enthusiasm would have been cause for the judgment of madness [ ... ] Two accounts of Smart and the nature of his madness have been preserved for us . Each permits some doubt that the poet was mad and could be regarded so in any age . " 
 Frances Anderson , in 1974 characterised Smart 's " illness " as insanity and obsession , but believed that " Smart 's madness consisted of his efforts to obey literally St Paul 's injunction to the Thessalonians : ' Pray without ceasing . ' " During his episodes of illness , as Anderson continued , Smart " probably suffered some periods of delirium " but also " appeared to know what he was doing " . Smart 's actions were similar to 18th @-@ century Methodists that were " addicted to public prayer with what was thought to be overly charged high spirits . Such <unk> of religious emotionalism were often confined not only to private <unk> , but also to Bedlam " . Later , in 1998 , Charles Rosen pointed out that " The Enlightenment condemned religious enthusiasm as appropriate for the uneducated and the great unwashed " and " it is understandable that the only original and vital religious poetry between 1760 and 1840 should have been written by poets considered genuinely mad by their contemporaries : Smart , Blake , and Hölderlin . " 
 Accounts at the end of the 20th century focused on the effects of Smart 's confinement . Clement Hawes , following Michel Foucault 's interpretation of the 18th century that there was an " ' <unk> ' of madness " , believed that Smart emotionally connected with animals because of the " medical stigmatization " he felt at the hands of his fellow man . Chris Mounsey , agreeing with Hawes 's interpretation , believed that Smart 's treatment was " a <unk> process and had taught him to hold his tongue and sit out his time as quietly as possible . " Contrary to the <unk> , Allan Ingram argued that Jubilate Agno was " a poetic phenomenon that would have demolished contemporary poetic orthodoxies had it been publishable . The mad individual presented a gross distortion of the human form that nevertheless insisted on remaining human , but mad language could be even more disturbing . "

 " My Mother , the Fiend " also marks Hannigan 's third and final guest appearance on the show . Hannigan was open to appearing in another episode , but she was unsure whether or not her busy schedule would allow it . She also felt that the character 's arc had come to a natural close in this episode . In an interview , Rob Thomas said that due to her busy schedule , it was difficult to write an episode featuring Hannigan . On Hannigan 's role in the episode and her future availability , Thomas commented : 
 Well , to work around Alyson ’ s schedule is really difficult for us . It ’ s hard to plan to write an episode with Alyson in it because we don ’ t know exactly what her free days are . Even the episode that we did with her , there was a huge <unk> , we actually had to slide that story line one episode down from when we originally wrote that . We ’ ve loved having Alyson in the show , and I ’ m sure we will again , some day , if she ’ s willing , because we ’ ve had a lot of fun with her . But we have nothing booked with her right now . 
 The episode also features a reappearance by Celeste Kane ( Lisa Thornhill ) , a recurring character during the first season . The second season DVD includes an alternate ending to this episode , which was released around the airing of the episode as a promotional tool . The alternate ending starts the same way as the regular ending , with Veronica discovering that Meg is pregnant . But instead of the episode ending there , Meg 's mom comes into the room while Veronica hides in the bathroom . When the mom leaves , Meg is dead with a pillow over her face , indicating smothering . However , Veronica takes the pillow off before a nurse comes in . Thomas commented that the alternate ending was never going to be the actual conclusion to the episode . He said : " We never seriously considered having that be the ending . There were various other endings that we did have , but they were so subtly different , it was like , ' When does Veronica enter the room ? ' " The idea to promote the alternate ending was a joint venture from the UPN promotions department and executive producer Joel Silver . After Thomas learned that others wanted an alternate ending , he decided to make it very different from the episode 's actual conclusion . " But once we could have a [ very different ] alternate ending , we thought , ' Let 's make it rock . ' The beauty of having that alternate ending is that we don 't have to play it out in the next episode . "

 The episode received mostly positive reviews . Price Peterson , of TV.com , gave the episode a positive review , writing that he " [ l ] <unk> this episode .

" He also praised the information found on Veronica 's mother : " It was nice that Veronica got to see a better side of her mother than we usually do … <unk> ! " Maureen Ryan , of the Chicago Tribune , called the episode " engrossing " and that it is a better use of a viewer 's time than Lost , which aired at the same time as Veronica Mars . 
 Rowan Kaiser , of The A.V. Club , lauded Veronica 's characterization as an antiheroine in the episode . " I 've discussed times when [ Veronica has ] behaved in ways that I 'm not certain are ethical , but this might be the most blatant case .

 = Rochdale Town Hall = 
 Rochdale Town Hall is a Victorian @-@ era municipal building in Rochdale , Greater Manchester , England . It is " widely recognised as being one of the finest municipal buildings in the country " , and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building . The Town Hall functions as the ceremonial headquarters of Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council and houses local government departments , including the borough 's civil registration office . 
 Built in the Gothic Revival style at a cost of £ 160 @,@ 000 ( £ 13 @.@ 4 million in 2016 ) , it was inaugurated for the governance of the Municipal Borough of Rochdale on 27 September 1871 . The architect , William Henry Crossland , was the winner of a competition held in 1864 to design a new Town Hall . It had a 240 @-@ foot ( 73 m ) clock tower topped by a wooden spire with a gilded statue of Saint George and the Dragon , both of which were destroyed by fire on 10 April 1883 , leaving the building without a spire for four years . A new 190 @-@ foot ( 58 m ) stone clock tower and spire in the style of Manchester Town Hall was designed by Alfred Waterhouse , and erected in 1888 . 
 Art critic Nikolaus Pevsner described the building as possessing a " rare picturesque beauty " . Its stained glass windows are credited as " the finest modern examples of their kind " . The building came to the attention of Adolf Hitler , who was said to have admired it so much that he wished to ship the building , brick @-@ by @-@ brick , to Nazi Germany had the United Kingdom been defeated in the Second World War . 
 = = History = = 
 Rochdale had developed into an increasingly large , populous , and prosperous urban mill town since the Industrial Revolution . Its newly built rail and canal network , and numerous factories , resulted in the town being " remarkable for many wealthy merchants " . In January 1856 the electorate of the Rochdale constituency petitioned the Privy Council for the grant of a charter of incorporation under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 , to constitute the town as a municipal borough . This would give it limited political autonomy via an elected town council , comprising a mayor , aldermen , and councillors , to oversee local affairs . The petition was successful and the charter was granted in September 1856 . The newly formed Rochdale Corporation — the local authority for the Municipal Borough of Rochdale — suggested plans to build a town hall in which to conduct its business in May 1858 . The site of an abandoned 17th @-@ century house known as The Wood was proposed . Six months later , in April 1860 , Rochdale Corporation arranged to buy the site on the outskirts of the town centre for £ 4 @,@ 730 ( £ 427 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) . However , plans were shelved due to lengthy negotiations and increasing land prices . In January 1864 the scheme resumed with a new budget of £ 20 @,@ 000 ( £ 1 @,@ 690 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) . 
 The wood and surrounding area were cleared , but it is unknown what became of the dispossessed ; there was no legal requirement for the authorities to rehouse the former inhabitants . A design competition to find a " neat and elegant building " was held by the Rochdale Corporation , who offered the winning architect a prize of £ 100 ( £ 8 @,@ 900 in 2016 ) , and a Maltese cross souvenir . From the 27 entries received , William Henry Crossland 's was chosen . The Rochdale @-@ born Radical and Liberal statesman John Bright laid the foundation stone on 31 March 1866 . Construction was complete by 1871 although the cost had , by then , increased beyond expectations from the projected £ 40 @,@ 000 to £ 160 @,@ 000 ( £ 13 @,@ 440 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) . 
 The Town Hall was one of several built in the textile towns of North West England following the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 , but is one of only two in Greater Manchester built in the Gothic style . Between the setting of the foundation stone and the building 's completion , revisions and additions were made to the original design . Money was " lavished " upon the decor and inventory , and the extra expenditure did not escape the ire of its critics . The cost of the building increased year @-@ on @-@ year through a combination of mismanagement , overspending and " unauthorised work " . Public criticism of the high cost was aimed at Crossland and the Mayor of Rochdale , George Leach Ashworth , who oversaw the work . Nevertheless , Rochdale Town Hall was ultimately celebrated as " a source of pride " , and its completion prompted celebration and rejoicing ; it transformed a " derelict and marshy riverbank in to a huge romantic Gothic plaza " . The opening ceremony on 27 September 1871 was performed by Mayor Ashworth , who had been instrumental in the changes made to the building 's design . 
 In 1882 or 1883 dry rot was found in the 240 @-@ foot ( 73 m ) high spire . On the recommendation of Rochdale 's Borough Surveyor , contractors were engaged to rebuild it . The spire was to be demolished to clear the way for a replacement . It was rumoured that the workmen who were dismantling the top section of the wooden spire may have tried to speed up the dismantling process with matches and , at 9 : 20 am on 10 April 1883 , a blaze was discovered . Despite the efforts of volunteers and the local fire brigade , 100 minutes after the discovery of the fire the entire spire , including a statue of Saint George and the Dragon , had been destroyed . The cause of the fire was never established , but Rochdale 's fire service was criticised for taking longer to respond to the blaze than Oldham 's , ( based 5 miles ( 8 km ) south ) , despite the Rochdale Fire Brigade being based in the Town Hall . Alfred Waterhouse was given the task of designing a 190 @-@ foot ( 58 m ) stone replacement . His work on the clock tower , which was built between 1885 and 1887 about 15 yards ( 14 m ) further to the east than the original , shows many similarities to Manchester Town Hall , which he also designed . The tower was opened in 1888 ; an inscribed plaque commemorates the fire of 1883 . 
 On 15 January 1931 , at the height of the Great Depression in the United Kingdom , the Territorial Army was called to guard the Town Hall during a protest against unemployment and hunger . 
 In May 1938 , Rochdale @-@ born actress , singer and comedian Gracie Fields was granted Honorary Freedom of the Borough for her contribution to entertainment . " When the ceremony was over , Gracie went onto the town hall balcony to receive the cheers and good wishes of the thousands of people who were packing the streets below . " 
 Although it is not fully understood how it came to his attention , Rochdale Town Hall was admired by Adolf Hitler . It has been suggested a visit by Hitler in 1912 – 13 while staying with his half @-@ brother Alois Hitler , Jr. in Liverpool , or military intelligence on Rochdale , or information from Nazi sympathiser William Joyce ( who had lived in Oldham ) , brought the building to his attention . Hitler admired the architecture so much that it is believed he wished to ship the building , brick @-@ by @-@ brick , to Nazi Germany had German @-@ occupied Europe encompassed the United Kingdom . Rochdale was broadly avoided by German bombers during the Second World War .

 At OS Grid Reference <unk> ( 53 @.@ <unk> ° , − 2 @.@ 1594 ° ) , Rochdale Town Hall is the centerpiece of Rochdale , located in Town Hall Square to the south of The Esplanade and the River Roch . The Parish Church of St Chad is situated by the wooded hillside behind the Town Hall . In Town Hall Square , opposite the Town Hall , is a statue of John Bright , dated 1891 , and the Rochdale War Memorial . Bright was a Rochdale @-@ born orator , pacifist and Member of Parliament for Birmingham known for his campaigns to repeal the Corn Laws as well as his opposition to slavery in the United States and the Crimean War . <unk> Rochdale art gallery and local studies centre is across The Esplanade .

 The frontage and principal entrance of the Town Hall face the River Roch , and comprises a portico of three arches intersected by buttresses . Decorating the main entrance are stone crockets , gargoyles , and finials . Four gilded lions above a parapet around three sides of the portico bear shields carrying the coats of arms of Rochdale Council and the hundred of Salford . 
 Rochdale Town Hall is 264 feet ( 80 m ) wide , 123 feet ( 37 m ) deep , and is faced with millstone grit quarried from Blackstone Edge and Todmorden . Although now blackened by industrial pollution , the building has been described as a " rich example of domestic Gothic architecture " . Naturalistic carved foliage on the exterior recalls the style of Southwell Minster , and the architecture is influenced by Perpendicular Period and medieval town halls of continental Europe . The building has been likened to Manchester Town Hall , Manchester Assize Courts , the Royal Courts of Justice , and St Pancras railway station , all products of the Gothic Revival architectural movement . The stained glass windows , some of which were designed by William Morris , have been described as " the finest modern examples of their kind " . At each end of the frontage is an octagonal staircase . 
 In the words of Nikolaus Pevsner , Rochdale Town Hall has " a splendidly craggy exterior of blackened stone " . The building has a roughly symmetrical E @-@ shaped plan , and is broken down into three self @-@ contained segments : a central Great Hall and transverse wings at each end , which have variously been used as debating chambers , corporation @-@ rooms , trade and a public hall . The south @-@ east wing used to house the magistrates ' courts , and the north @-@ west wing the mayor 's rooms . In the north @-@ east is a tower . Access to the main entrance is through a central porte cochere . The façade extends across 14 bays , of which the Great Hall accounts for seven . On both sides , the outermost bays rise to three storeys . They flank asymmetric round @-@ headed arcades — two to the left and three to the right , all of single @-@ storey height — which sit below plain mullioned windows , balconies and ornately decorated gables . 
 = = = Clock tower = = = 
 The present clock tower , which has a stone spire , was built to replace the one destroyed in the 1883 fire . It was designed by Alfred Waterhouse in a similar style to one of his earlier works , the clock tower of Manchester Town Hall . The first stone was laid by Thomas Schofield JP , Alderman and Rochdale Borough Councillor , on 19 October 1885 and the tower was declared complete on 20 June 1887 , the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria . It contains five bells which ring on the hour and at 15 @-@ minute intervals . The design of the original tower was more elaborate and 50 feet ( 15 m ) higher than its successor , which is 190 feet ( 58 m ) tall . 
 The tower rises from a plinth and has four stages including the gable @-@ headed clock stage , which is also decorated with pinnacles . A small stone spire completes the composition . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 Murals in the former council chamber depict the inventions that drove the Industrial Revolution , and the Great Hall is adorned with a large fresco of the signing of Magna Carta by artist Henry Holiday , although the painting is dirty . Responsibility for the decoration of the interior was given to Heaton , Butler and Bayne , who incorporated floor tiles that were manufactured by <unk> and decorated with the local insignia and the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom . The stone Grand Staircase , which leads from the vestibule to the Great Hall , is decorated with stained glass ; such glass windows decorate most of the Town Hall and are considered to be the finest example of the work of Heaton , Butler and Bayne . The medieval style Great Hall , described by Pevsner as a room of " great splendour and simplicity " , has a hammerbeam roof flanked by statues of angels , in a design that resembles Westminster Hall .

 The Town Hall was listed at Grade I on 25 October 1951 . Such buildings are defined as being of " exceptional interest , sometimes considered to be internationally important " . In February 2001 , it was one of 39 Grade I listed buildings , and 3 @,@ 701 listed buildings of all grades , in Greater Manchester . Within the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale , it is one of only three Grade I listed buildings , and 312 listed buildings of all grades . 
 Although the majority of local government functions take place in Rochdale 's Municipal Offices building , Rochdale Town Hall continues to be used for cultural and ceremonial functions . For instance it is used for the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale 's mayoralty , civil registry , and for formal naturalisation in British Citizenship ceremonies . 
 = Colin McCool = 
 Colin Leslie McCool ( 9 December 1916 – 5 April 1986 ) was an Australian cricketer who played in 14 Tests from 1946 to 1950 . McCool , born in Paddington , New South Wales , was an all @-@ rounder who bowled leg spin and googlies with a round arm action and as a lower order batsman was regarded as effective square of the wicket and against spin bowling . He made his Test début against New Zealand in 1946 , taking a wicket with his second delivery . He was part of Donald Bradman 's Invincibles team that toured England in 1948 but injury saw him miss selection in any of the Test matches . 
 A good tour of South Africa in 1949 – 50 was followed by a lack of opportunity in the next two seasons , leading McCool to sign a contract to play professional cricket in the Lancashire League in 1953 . Three years later , Somerset County Cricket Club recruited McCool where he was a success , especially as a middle @-@ order batsman ; he played five seasons and saw the club achieve its highest place in the County Championship since 1892 . He retired from cricket in 1960 and returned to Australia to work as a market gardener . He died in Concord , New South Wales on 5 April 1986 . 
 = = Early career = = 
 As a child growing up in Paddington , McCool attended Crown Street State School — earlier students included Victor Trumper and Monty Noble . He played his childhood cricket on concrete wickets in Moore Park and learnt to bowl from reading Clarrie Grimmett 's instructional book , Getting Wickets . McCool played his early grade cricket with Paddington Cricket Club before coming to the notice of the New South Wales selectors . He made his first @-@ class début for New South Wales against " Rest of Australia " in March 1940 , making 19 and 15 and taking one wicket . While the Australian Cricket Board suspended the Sheffield Shield competition at the end of the 1939 – 40 season , at the request of the Australian government , a series of matches were arranged to raise money for wartime charities in the following 1940 – 41 season . McCool played in six of these matches for New South Wales , scoring 416 runs at average of 52 @.@ 00 and taking 24 wickets at an average of 23 @.@ 50 . 
 McCool enlisted on 12 September 1941 and served as a Pilot Officer with the No. 33 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . Stationed in New Guinea , McCool had reached the rank of Flight Lieutenant when he was discharged from the RAAF on 18 September 1945 . 
 After the war , he moved to Brisbane and was selected in the Queensland cricket team . Playing for Queensland , he formed a formidable partnership with wicket @-@ keeper Don Tallon . He was selected in the Australian team to tour New Zealand in 1945 – 46 , making his Test début at the Basin Reserve in Wellington . He made seven runs in Australia 's only innings and took a wicket with his second ball in Test cricket ; the last man dismissed in the Test , Don McRae . 
 = = Test player = = 
 The following season , Wally Hammond 's England cricket team travelled to Australia for the 1946 – 47 Ashes series . In a warm @-@ up match before the series , McCool performed well for Queensland against the English tourists at the Brisbane Cricket Ground ( the ' Gabba ) , taking nine wickets and " the English batsmen seemed like rabbits fascinated in the presence of a snake " . He was selected for the First Test at the same ground the following week . He just missed out on a century on his Ashes debut , scoring 95 and only bowling one over as Australia won the Test by an innings and 332 runs . In the Second Test at Sydney , McCool took eight wickets , including the prize wicket of Hammond twice . Australia won by an innings and 33 runs . The Third Test at Melbourne saw McCool make his maiden Test century , 104 not out in a drawn match . The Melbourne businessman and underworld figure , John Wren had promised McCool one pound for every run he made that innings ; this was at a time when ten pounds was the average weekly wage in Australia . The cheque — given to McCool the next day — allowed him to place a deposit on a house . 
 He played in the remaining two Tests , making 272 runs at an average of 54 and taking 18 wickets at just over 27 apiece . He took 5 / 44 in the Fifth Test . Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack wrote that his batting featured " wristy cuts " and " vigorous hooks " , opining that there were " few better players of spin bowling on a difficult pitch " . Wisden said that his slow and loopy leg spin was " a clever mixture of leg @-@ breaks and googlies " . 
 India toured Australia for the first time in 1947 – 48 . McCool played in three Tests without much success , scoring only 46 runs and taking only four wickets . Nevertheless , he was selected as part of Australian team to tour England in 1948 that would be known as the Invincibles . He took 57 wickets on the tour but bowling for long periods caused him to continually tear a callus on his third finger , used to impart spin on the ball . As a result , his captain , Don Bradman , felt compelled to leave him out of the Test matches , feeling that his finger would not be able to handle the necessarily long bowling spells . This decision was aided by the then existing rule allowing a new ball to be used every 55 overs , allowing Bradman to use his fast bowlers more often . For the rest of his career , McCool was troubled by the skin rubbing off his spinning finger . McCool and his fellow fringe members of the squad , Ron Hamence and Doug Ring , would refer themselves as the " ground @-@ staff " as it was unlikely that the tour selectors would include them in the Test team that tour . The cricket writer Alan Gibson , who knew McCool well in his later cricket career at Somerset , wrote that the omission " distressed him greatly at the time , though he could be philosophical enough about it later " . 
 He played in all five Tests on tour against South Africa . He took 51 wickets in all matches , including 5 / 41 in the Second Test at Newlands . In 1950 – 51 , McCool was the leading wicket taker in the Sheffield Shield competition , however he was not selected in the Test team against the touring English ; nor against the West Indies the following season . 
 = = English cricket = = 
 Prior to the 1953 Australian team to tour England , McCool signed a professional contract with Lancashire League team East Lancashire , replacing fellow Australian leg spinner Bruce Dooland . In his first season in the league , he was the leading wicket @-@ taker with 93 wickets at the low average of 10 @.@ 2 runs per wicket , and he also made 678 runs at an average of 33 @.@ 9 . The following year , he played less often : his 547 runs came at the better average of 42 @.@ 1 but his 52 wickets cost 13 @.@ 1 apiece , and East Lancashire , who had finished either first or second in the Championship ten times in the previous twelve seasons , finished 10th out of 14 . He did not return to East Lancashire for the 1955 season due to being contracted to play county cricket for Somerset . The cricket writer Alan Gibson , who knew McCool well , wrote that " after he had made the decision to come , an extension of the qualifying period for overseas cricketers kept him waiting even longer " . 
 Delayed by the change to the rules , McCool had a five @-@ year stint from 1956 in English county cricket . Somerset , having finished on the bottom of the County Championship table for the four years between 1952 – 1955 , had embarked on a renewal programme . Part of the programme involved a vigorous recruiting campaign , including an offer to McCool that saw him return to first @-@ class cricket at the age of 39 . 
 At Somerset , McCool was an instant success as a batsman , scoring 1 @,@ 967 runs in his first season , including three centuries and a highest score of 141 . After four seasons , Somerset came off the bottom of the County Championship ( to 15th out of 17 ) , and Wisden was in no doubt of McCool 's influence : " Much of the credit for the all @-@ round improvement went to one man – McCool , " it wrote . " At the start of the season it was hoped that the former Australian Test leg @-@ break bowler would lend power and variety to the attack . From that viewpoint his 45 wickets at over thirty runs apiece might be counted disappointing . But with the bat McCool exceeded all expectations . He was one of the most consistent scorers in the country and he failed by only 34 to reach 2 @,@ 000 runs in his first season of county cricket . McCool was the backbone of a mediocre batting side , and he never departed from his natural attacking style . " Against the touring Australians that season he made 90 and 116 , the first innings 90 coming out of 139 in two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours and including 15 fours , the second innings century out of 167 in just 95 minutes , with four sixes and 14 fours . Wisden reported that he was " very severe on [ Ian Johnson ] and [ Jack Wilson ] " . 
 Over the 1956 / 57 new year , McCool was one of a party of 12 cricketers , all but one of them Test players , who made a brief trip to India to play two first @-@ class matches in celebration of the silver jubilee of the Bengal Cricket Association in a side raised by the Lancashire secretary Geoffrey Howard . McCool did not play in the first match and in the second , he replaced Jock Livingston , the team 's only wicketkeeper , who had been taken ill during the first game . McCool made only 23 and 1 with the bat , but he stumped Vinoo Mankad off the bowling of Dooland , one of only two stumpings in his career as a very occasional wicketkeeper . 
 Back in England in 1957 he was joined at Taunton by another Australian , Bill Alley , but still finished as the leading scorer for the county with 1 @,@ 678 runs in all matches , to go with 44 wickets . In the wet summer of 1958 Somerset finished third in the Championship , their highest position since 1892 . McCool 's contribution was 1 @,@ 590 runs and 46 wickets at , for him , the low average of 23 runs each . In this season , McCool made his highest score for Somerset – 169 out of a total of 314 against Worcestershire at Stourbridge – and in the last match of the season he produced his best bowling figures of his career , taking eight second @-@ innings Nottinghamshire wickets for 74 runs on what Wisden described as " a sporting pitch " . 
 In contrast to 1958 , the 1959 season was hot and dry and McCool 's figures improved : he made 1769 runs at an average of more than 40 runs per innings and took 64 first @-@ class wickets , more than in any other Somerset season . McCool 's final season with Somerset before his retirement was 1960 , and he signed off with 1 @,@ 222 runs and 29 wickets . 
 In 138 matches across the five seasons for Somerset , McCool made 7 @,@ 913 runs at an average of 33 @.@ 82 . He also took 219 wickets at 28 @.@ 05 but in his five years with the county he was never the first @-@ choice spin bowler : in his first two seasons , Somerset used Australian @-@ born slow left @-@ arm orthodox bowler John McMahon as the main spin bowler , with young off @-@ spin bowler Brian Langford also bowling more than McCool . When McMahon left , Langford took over as the top spin bowler , and by 1960 was bowling four times the number of overs that McCool took . But McCool had also lost some of his control at this stage : " He could do beguiling things with the ball , though length and line seemed to become a decreasing consideration , " says the history of Somerset cricket . He also made 146 catches , many of them at first slip , where he stood " rather deeper than usual " . His influence on Somerset 's recovery from the trough of the early 1950s was considerable . A later Somerset history says : " Occasionally some of the younger pros didn 't relish the way he treated them . Maybe they also resented that his salary was well in excess of their own . But their respect for his competitive approach and sheer experience was undeniable . " 
 = = Playing style = = 
 McCool had a round @-@ arm bowling action , releasing the ball with his arm almost parallel to the ground . Before he developed problems with the skin on his spinning finger , he was , in spite of his unorthodox action , able to generate sharp spin . The cricket writer , Jack Pollard said of McCool , " [ McCool ] was almost unplayable on badly prepared pitches , so wide and sharp was the turn of his leg @-@ breaks . " and that he " made even State [ i.e. first @-@ class ] batsmen look inept " . On the advice of coaches and ex @-@ players , McCool attempted to alter his action to a more orthodox style on several occasions but always returned to his natural style . 
 A short man but with a strong build , as a batsman he was a vigorous hooker and a wristy cutter , scoring mostly square of the wicket . He was particularly good against spin bowling , even on difficult pitches . 
 During his time at Somerset , he was known for " [ turning ] a match with his cracking strokes in an hour . " Alan Gibson wrote : " We hardly think of him as a stylist , and he was mostly a back @-@ foot player , getting the greater number of his runs in the segments fanning out from point and square @-@ leg . But he was enjoyable to watch , compact , tidy , combining powerful hitting with delicate placing . In the best Somerset tradition , he was always after the bowling , and in the best Australian tradition , he always relished a fight . " But he also adapted his style to suit English pitches : in an early innings for Somerset , he was out trying to hook a ball from Trevor Bailey . " The hook , he decided , was a stroke to be used sparingly on English pitches ... McCool was constantly amending his technique that season [ 1956 ] , whenever he spotted a flaw in his method . Again and again he held the Somerset batting together . Nothing in his previous experience had equipped him for the task of holding up a losing side in a damp English summer . " 
 He was renowned for his catching , often spending an hour at a time practising catching a ball thrown into the side of a roller normally used to prepare the cricket pitch . Journalist and former team @-@ mate Bill O 'Reilly said after McCool 's death in 1986 : " If Colin had played in the last 10 years , he would have been regarded as one of the greatest all @-@ rounders ever in Australian cricket . He was a great batsman , [ ... ] a wonderful bowler and one of the best slips fieldsmen I have ever seen . " 
 = = Personality and personal life = = 
 Accounts of McCool in his Somerset period portray him as a thoughtful but slightly aloof character . " Off the field he was a quiet man , " wrote David Foot . He was " a contemplative pipe @-@ smoker in the corner of the dressing room , " says another account , and somewhat intolerant of others who appeared less committed than he was . " Occasionally some of the younger pros didn 't relish the way he treated them . Maybe they also resented that his salary was well in excess of their own . " 
 Alan Gibson wrote about him more <unk> : " He thought about the game a lot . Many Australian cricketers do , more than English cricketers probably , but McCool was in some ways an untypical Australian . He had a diffidence and gentleness , which do not always spring to mind as familiar Australian qualities : but he had plenty of Australian determination . " 
 Gibson wrote that McCool " did not quite come to terms with the West Country " . He went on : " He missed the sunshine . ' There 's no winter , ' he said , ' and the beer 's better . And the <unk> off @-@ spinners don 't turn . ' I think an additional reason was that he found some difficulty in accepting the conventions of English cricket as it was then . There was a Somerset committee member , who liked and admired him , and would greet him with , ' Morning , McCool ' . That committee member was seeking to be courteous . He would have thought it pompous to say ' Mr McCool ' , and impertinent to say ' Colin ' . But it infuriated Colin . He thought it a reflection on his status . He would have preferred something like ' Hi , Col , you old bastard . ' The worlds were too far apart . " 
 McCool was given a testimonial season by Somerset in 1959 after just three years with county and the circumstances were unusual enough for it to be remarked on in the county 's Year Book , published in the winter before the season . " Although Colin McCool has played for the County for three seasons only , this Testimonial is a fitting reward for his valuable services as an all @-@ rounder and off the field , where his influence is most marked . " 
 After retirement from first @-@ class cricket at the end of the 1960 season in England , McCool returned to Australia , taking up market gardening with a specialty in rare blooms at <unk> Beach on the Central Coast of New South Wales . He continued playing club cricket in the Newcastle competition for Belmont until rheumatism forced him to retire from all forms of cricket aged 55 : " Rheumatism in my right hand made it embarrassing for me to continue . It was alarming to an old pro like me who prided himself on length and directions to have the ball slip out of my fingers out of control . " 
 McCool was the author of two books on cricket : Cricket is a Game , which was an autobiography , and The Best Way to Play Cricket , both published in 1961 . John Arlott , reviewing them in Wisden 1962 , said the first was " full of trenchant good sense , humour , anecdote and shrewd observation " . The second book , Arlott wrote , was " to the best of this reviewer 's knowledge , the first cricket book to be initially published in the modern paper @-@ back format " . It was , he added , " full of good instruction and ... sets down some genuine cricket wisdom with freshness and vitality " . 
 He married Dorothy <unk> <unk> in 1943 in Sydney . His son , Russ McCool , who was born in Taunton , played one first @-@ class match for Somerset in 1982 , in addition to playing for New South Wales Colts and New South Wales Country .

 Super Mario World 2 : Yoshi 's Island , known in Japan as <unk> 's Island ( <unk> , <unk> Airando ) , is a 1995 platform video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . Acting as a prequel to Super Mario World , the game casts players as Yoshi as he escorts Baby Mario through 48 levels in order to reunite him with his brother Luigi , who had been kidnapped by Baby Bowser 's minions . As a Super Mario series platformer , Yoshi runs and jumps to reach the end of the level while solving puzzles and collecting items . In a style new to the series , the game has a hand @-@ drawn aesthetic and is the first to have Yoshi as its main character . The game introduces his signature abilities to flutter jump , produce eggs from swallowed enemies , and transform into vehicles . It also features 2D graphics with Linear transformations ( similar to Super Mario World ) . 
 The game 's hand @-@ drawn aesthetic — a style new to the series — descends from producer and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto 's distaste for the computer pre @-@ rendered graphics of the game 's contemporary Donkey Kong Country . Yoshi 's Island was released in Japan in August 1995 , and worldwide two months later . Some of its special effects were powered by a new Super FX2 microchip . The game was rereleased for the Game Boy Advance with few changes in 2002 under the title Yoshi 's Island : Super Mario Advance 3 . Nintendo later released this version via the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U Virtual Console . 
 Yoshi 's Island received " instant " and " universal acclaim " , according to IGN and review aggregator Metacritic , and sold over four million copies . Both contemporaneous and retrospective reviewers offered lavish praise for the game 's aesthetics , sound , level design , and gameplay , and posited Yoshi 's Island as a masterpiece and the best platformer of all time . The game brought newfound renown to both Yoshi as a character and Miyamoto 's artistic and directorial career . The distinct art style and Yoshi 's signature characteristics established in Yoshi 's Island would carry throughout a series of cameos , spin @-@ offs , and sequels , including the 1998 Yoshi 's Story , 2006 Yoshi 's Island DS , 2014 Yoshi 's New Island , and 2015 Yoshi 's Woolly World . The next Mario 2D platform game for home consoles was New Super Mario Bros. Wii , released 14 years later . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Yoshi 's Island is a two @-@ dimensional side @-@ scrolling platformer in which players help friendly dinosaurs known as Yoshis escort Baby Mario safely through 48 levels across six worlds in order to rescue his brother Luigi , who had been kidnapped by an evil Magikoopa named Kamek . 
 Each level casts players as a different colored Yoshi , who must escort Baby Mario on his back and reach the end of the level , where he is passed on to the next Yoshi . Similar to Super Mario World , Yoshi can use his tongue to ensnare enemies and put them into his mouth . When something is in his mouth , Yoshi can either spit it out as an attack , or swallow it to turn it into an egg . These eggs can then be thrown at an angle , even bouncing off walls , to attack enemies or reach far away or hard to reach items . Yoshi can carry up to six eggs at a time , with some colored eggs spawning items once they hit something . Yoshi can also eat watermelons that let him spit out seeds , or flaming enemies that let him spit out fire . Yoshi is also able to perform a flutter jump , in which he can kick his legs in mid @-@ air to gain extra height or hover over long distances , and a ground pound , a downward attack that can hammer down on enemies and stumps . 
 The goal of each level is to protect Baby Mario , who rides on Yoshi 's back . If Yoshi is hit by an enemy or obstacle , Baby Mario will float off into a bubble and a timer will start counting down . If the player fails to recover Baby Mario before the counter reaches zero , Baby Mario will be taken away by Koopas and Yoshi will lose a life . The timer can recover up to ten seconds , and Yoshi can collect stars to increase the amount of time on the counter . However , if Yoshi falls into a bottomless pit , gets crushed , or comes into contact with spikes or lava , he will automatically lose a life . In some areas , players can collect a Starman that transforms Baby Mario into Super Baby Mario . During these areas , players take control of Baby Mario who , for a short period , is invincible , can run on walls and ceilings , and can float using his cape . Additionally , some areas transform Yoshi into various vehicles , such as a helicopter or digger , allowing him to reach otherwise inaccessible areas for a short amount of time . 
 Each of the game 's worlds feature eight main levels , with a boss appearing at the end of every fourth and eighth level . Hidden throughout each of these levels are five Flowers and twenty Red Coins , the latter of which are hidden behind specific coins in each level . Collecting Flowers adds flowers to the gate at the end of each level ( not including boss levels ) . If the player manages to land on an open flower after jumping through the end gate , they can play a bonus game during which they can earn extra lives or bonus items that can be activated from the pause menu , such as additional stars or <unk> glasses that reveal the location of hidden Red Coins . At the end of each level , players receive a score based on how many Flowers and Red Coins they found , as well as how many stars they have remaining , with a maximum score of 100 awarded for finding all Flowers and Red Coins and ending the level with 30 stars . Completing all levels in a world with a score of 100 unlocks two additional levels for that world .

 While Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto worked on Super Mario World , he thought to make Yoshi the series ' " next hero " since the game designer did not like the other Yoshi games , including Yoshi 's Safari and Yoshi 's Cookie , and thought he could make something more authentic . When he first brought the game to Nintendo marketing , they declined the game for having Mario @-@ style graphics rather than the vogue , computer pre @-@ rendered graphics of Donkey Kong Country . In comparison , they felt that his game lacked the power to impress . Incensed and opposed to the style , Miyamoto instead further escalated his cartoonish visuals into a hand @-@ drawn , crayon style . Nintendo 's marketing department accepted this revision . Miyamoto later recalled feeling that the marketing department wanted " better hardware and more beautiful graphics instead of ... art " . Around the time of his rejection , Miyamoto allegedly said that " Donkey Kong Country proves that players will put up with mediocre gameplay as long as the art is good " . However , he later clarified his remarks , stating that " recently some rumour got out that I didn 't really like that game ? I just want to clarify that that 's not the case , because I was very involved in that . And even emailing almost daily with Tim Stamper right up until the end . " 
 Yoshi 's Island was developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . According to Miyamoto , who served as a producer , Yoshi 's Island was in development for four years , which let the team add " lots of magic tricks " . The game cartridge used an extra microchip to support the game 's rotation , scaling and other sprite @-@ changing special effects . Yoshi 's Island was designed to use the Super FX chip , but when Nintendo stopped supporting the chip , the game became the first to use Argonaut Games 's Super FX2 microchip . The chip powered scenes including a drawbridge falling into the foreground , rotation effects like rolling and enlarged rather than reanimated enemies , and a psychedelic effect in a level when Yoshi touches a floating fungus . 
 Yoshi 's Island was released first in Japan in August 1995 , and two months later in North America and Europe . At the time of release , the Super NES was in its twilight as a console in anticipation of Nintendo 's upcoming console to be released the following year , 1996 . Yoshi 's Island was rereleased for the Game Boy Advance as Yoshi 's Island : Super Mario Advance 3 in North America on September 23 , 2002 . In the game 's preview at E3 2002 , IGN named Yoshi 's Island " Best Platformer " on a handheld console . The Game Boy Advance version is a direct port of the original , apart from few changes . The developers used the Yoshi voice from a subsequent series game , cropped the original display to fit the handheld 's smaller screen , and added exclusive bonus levels . Like the other Super Mario Advance rereleases , the handheld version includes the 1983 game Mario Bros. with support for up to four players via link cable . The new cartridge did not need an extra microchip to support the original 's special effects . 
 The Game Boy Advance version of the game was released on the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U via Nintendo 's digital Virtual Console platform . The port retains the handheld version 's cropped screen and pack @-@ in Mario Bros. game , though its multiplayer mode is disabled . The 3DS version was released on December 16 , 2011 , as an exclusive reward for early adopters of the Nintendo 3DS . It did not receive a wider release . The Wii U version was released worldwide on April 24 , 2014 . At E3 2010 , Nintendo demoed " classic " 2D titles such as Yoshi 's Island as remastered 3D games with a " pop @-@ up book feel " .

 Yoshi 's Island received " instant " and " universal acclaim " , according to an IGN retrospective and video game review aggregator Metacritic , respectively . At the time of its 1995 release , Matt Taylor of Diehard GameFan thought Yoshi 's Island could be " possibly the best platform game of all time " . Nintendo Power too said that the game was " one of the biggest , most beautiful games ever made " . Next Generation was also most impressed by the game 's " size and playability " . Diehard GameFan 's three reviewers gave the game a near perfect score . To wit , Nicholas Dean Des Barres said it was " one of the handful of truly perfect games ever produced " , and lamented that the magazine had given Donkey Kong Country , which he felt was a lackluster game in comparison , the extra single point for a perfect score . Casey Loe removed that one point for Baby Mario 's " annoying screech " . Nintendo Power and Nintendo Life too found Baby Mario 's crying sounds annoying . Major Mike of GamePro called it " a work of art . " He lauded the " almost perfect " control , the variety of techniques , the graphical variety , and the " abundance of hidden items and concealed rooms " , and unlike other reviewers , he found Baby Mario 's cries for help to be very affecting . He concluded that Yoshi 's Island " is one of the last of a dying breed : a 16 @-@ bit game that shows real heart and creativity . " Reviewing the Super NES release over a decade later , Kaes Delgrego of Nintendo Life said the crying and some easy boss battles , while both minor , were the game 's only shortcomings . Delgrego charged Yoshi 's Island with perfecting the genre , calling it " perhaps the greatest platformer of all time " . The game has sold over four million copies . 
 Both contemporaneous and retrospective reviewers offered lavish praise for the game 's aesthetics , level design , and gameplay , which became legacies of the game . Some called it " charm " . Delgrego of Nintendo Life would stop mid @-@ game just to watch what enemies would do . Martin Watts of the same publication called it " an absolute pleasure on the eyes and unlike any other SNES game " . Others praised the control scheme , technical effects , and sound design . Nintendo Life 's Delgrego felt " goosebumps and <unk> " during the ending theme , and marked the soundtrack 's range from the lighthearted intro to the " epic grandeur of the final boss battle " . 
 Edge praised the game 's balance of challenge and accessibility . The magazine thought that the new power @-@ ups of Yoshi 's Island gave its gameplay and level design great range , and that the powers were significant additions to the series on par with the suits of Super Mario Bros. 3 or Yoshi 's own debut in Super Mario World . Diehard GameFan 's Taylor wrote that there was enough gameplay innovation to make him cry and listed his favorites as the Baby Mario cape invincibility power @-@ up , the machine gun @-@ style seed spitting , and the snowball hill level . Nintendo Life 's Watts called the egg stockpiling mechanic as " clever " for the way it encourages experimentation with the environment as well as tempered wastefulness . Edge thought of Yoshi 's Island as a " fusion of technology and creativity , each enhancing the other " . The magazine considered the game 's special effects expertly integrated into the gameplay , and described the developer 's handicraft as having an " attention to detail that few games can match " . 
 Reviewing the Game Boy Advance release in 2002 , Craig Harris of IGN wrote that Yoshi 's Island was both the console 's best platformer as well as " the best damn platformer ever developed " . While acknowledging the game 's roots in the Super Mario series , he said the game created enough gameplay ideas to constitute its own franchise . IGN 's Lucas M. Thomas wrote that the game 's story was also interesting as the origin story for the Mario brothers . Harris felt that the FX2 sprite @-@ changing effects gave the game " life " and that the Game Boy Advance cartridge could handle the effects just as well . He added that Yoshi 's morphing abilities and sound effects were designed well . Levi Buchanan of IGN said the game struck the right balance of tutorial by trial and error . IGN 's Harris also noted a few Game Boy Advance @-@ specific issues : framerate drop in areas where a lot is happening onscreen , camera panning problems due to the screen 's lower resolution , and a " poor " implementation of the " dizzy " special effect on the handheld release . Critics wrote that the " coloring book " -style graphics held up well . IGN 's Harris felt it was the best of the Super Mario Advance games . Of the similar version for the Wii U , Watts of Nintendo Life also noticed the framerate issues and problems resulting from the screen 's closer crop , which were " not enough to ruin the game , but ... noticeable " . Edge felt that game 's only disappointment was the linearity of its overworld following the exploratory Super Mario World and that the sequel would " inevitably ... have less impact " in comparison .

 Multiple retrospective critics declared Yoshi 's Island a " masterpiece " . IGN recalled it as " one of the most loved SNES adventures of all time " . Yoshi 's Island brought newfound renown to both Yoshi as a character and Shigeru Miyamoto 's artistic and directorial career . IGN 's Lucas M. Thomas wrote that game marked where Yoshi " came into his own " and developed many of his definitive characteristics : the " signature " flutter jump , and ability to throw eggs and transform shape . Baby Mario , who debuted in the game , went on to have his own career in a number of sports @-@ related titles . Series producer Takashi Tezuka said he consciously continued " the handicraft feel " of the original throughout the series , which later included yarn and similar variations . Official Nintendo Magazine called the art style " a bold step ... that paid off handsomely " . Delgrego of Nintendo Life wrote that the game marked a new era of art in video games that prioritized creativity over graphics technology . 
 Delgrego continued that the game 's countdown @-@ based life was a " revolutionary " mechanic that would later become ubiquitous in games like the Halo series . Martin Watts also of Nintendo Life considered Super Mario 64 to be a more momentous event in gaming history , but felt that Yoshi 's Island was the " most significant " event in the " Mario Bros. timeline " . In a retrospective , IGN wrote that Super NES owners widely embraced the game alongside Donkey Kong Country . 
 IGN 's Jared Petty wrote that Yoshi 's Island bested " the test of time far better than many of its contemporaries " . Levi Buchanan of IGN thought Nintendo took a risk with Yoshi 's Island by making Mario passive and giving Yoshi new abilities . Christian Donlan of 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die wrote that the game was a testament to the Mario team 's " staggering confidence " in its development ability . He said the game was " perhaps the most imaginative platformer " of its time . Yoshi 's Island ranked 22nd on Official Nintendo Magazine 's 2009 top 100 Nintendo games as a " bone fide classic " , 15th on IGN 's 2014 top 125 Nintendo games of all time , and 2nd on USgamer 's 2015 best Mario platformers list .

 Yoshi 's Island led to a strong year for Yoshi as a character . IGN 's Thomas added that the hand @-@ drawn style of Yoshi 's Island made the computer @-@ generated Donkey Kong Country appear outdated , though both games sold well , and Rareware included a Yoshi cameo in their sequel , Donkey Kong Country 2 : Diddy 's Kong Quest , released that same year . Yoshi 's Island graphics and characters were also incorporated into the 1996 Super NES tile puzzle game Tetris Attack . 
 Following Yoshi 's Island 's success , Nintendo developed Yoshi 's Story , a 1998 platformer for the Nintendo 64 , which " disappointed " audiences and deflated " massive ... anticipation " with fetch quests and the 3D style Miyamoto eschewed in its predecessor . The Nintendo 64 game expanded on Yoshi 's character voice as introduced in Yoshi 's Island , but also " dumbed down Yoshi 's character " . Nintendo created two Yoshi 's Island spin @-@ off games : the tilt sensor @-@ controlled Yoshi Topsy Turvy ( 2004 , Game Boy Advance ) , which was developed by Artoon and critically panned , and the Nintendo @-@ developed minigame Yoshi Touch & Go ( 2005 , Nintendo DS ) . The 1995 original release received a direct sequel in 2006 : Yoshi 's Island DS , also developed by Artoon . Titled Yoshi 's Island 2 until just before it shipped , the game retained the core concept of transporting baby Nintendo characters , and added babies Princess Peach , Bowser , Donkey Kong , and Wario , each with an individual special ability . Yoshi had a similar move set to Yoshi 's Island and added dash and float abilities , but was more passive a character compared to the babies on his back . 
 About seven years later , series producer Takashi Tezuka decided enough time had passed to make another direct sequel , Yoshi 's New Island ( 2013 , Nintendo 3DS ) . It was developed by former Artoon employees at their new company , <unk> . As in the original , Yoshi carries Baby Mario and throws eggs . The game adds the ability to swallow big foes , which become big eggs that can destroy big obstacles . Yoshi 's Island DS developer <unk> assisted in its development . In 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die ( 2010 ) , Christian Donlan wrote that despite the " streamlined " Yoshi 's Story and " brilliant " Yoshi 's Touch and Go , " the original was never bettered and never truly advanced upon " . In Eurogamer 's 2015 preview of Yoshi 's Woolly World , Tom Phillips wrote that it had " been 20 years since the last truly great Yoshi 's Island " . The next console release of a Mario 2D side @-@ scroller , New Super Mario Bros. Wii , was released 14 years later .

 Brosnan was born in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda , County Louth , Ireland , the only child of Thomas Brosnan , a carpenter , and May ( née Smith , born circa 1934 ) . He lived in Navan , County Meath for 12 years and considers it his home town . Brosnan 's father abandoned the family when Pierce was an infant . When he was four years old , his mother moved to London to work as a nurse . From that point on , he was largely brought up by his grandparents , Philip and Kathleen Smith . After their deaths , he lived with an aunt and then an uncle , but was subsequently sent to live in a boarding house run by a woman named Eileen . He was educated at Elliott School , now known as Ark Putney Academy , a coeducational secondary school with academy status in South West London . 
 According to Brosnan , 
 Childhood was fairly solitary . I grew up in a very small town called Navan in County Meath . I never knew my father . He left when I was an infant and I was left in the care of my mother and my grandparents . To be Catholic in the ' 50s , and to be Irish Catholic in the ' 50s , and have a marriage which was not there , a father who was not there , consequently , the mother , the wife suffered greatly . My mother was very courageous . She took the bold steps to go away and be a nurse in England . Basically wanting a better life for her and myself . My mother came home once a year , twice a year . 
 Brosnan was brought up in a Roman Catholic family and educated in a local school run by the de la Salle Brothers while serving as an altar boy . 
 Brosnan left Ireland on 12 August 1964 and was reunited with his mother and her new husband , William Carmichael , now living in the Scottish village of Longniddry , East Lothian . Carmichael took Brosnan to see a James Bond film for the first time ( Goldfinger ) , at the age of 11 . Later moving back to London , Brosnan was educated at Elliott School , a state comprehensive school in Putney , south west London . Brosnan has spoken about the transition from Ireland to England and his education in London ; " When you go to a very large city , a metropolis like London , as an Irish boy of 10 , life suddenly moves pretty fast . From a little school of , say , seven classrooms in Ireland , to this very large comprehensive school , with over 2 @,@ 000 children . And you 're Irish . And they make you feel it ; the British have a wonderful way of doing that , and I had a certain deep sense of being an outsider . " When he attended school , his nickname was " Irish " . 
 After leaving school at 16 , he decided to be a painter and began training in commercial illustration at Saint Martin 's School of Art . While attending a rehearsal for a workshop at the Oval House , a fire eater was teaching people how to eat fire and he decided to join . A circus agent saw him busking and hired him for three years . He later trained for three years as an actor at the Drama Centre London . Brosnan has described the feeling of becoming an actor and the impact it had on his life : " When I found acting , or when acting found me , it was a liberation . It was a stepping stone into another life , away from a life that I had , and acting was something I was good at , something which was appreciated . That was a great satisfaction in my life . "
