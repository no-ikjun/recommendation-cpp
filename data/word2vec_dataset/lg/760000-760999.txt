 The complex was officially opened in 2000 , but has been closed for renovation since at least February 2008 . While it was open , visitors were allowed to tour portions of the complex ; the Underground City was popular with foreign tourists but remained virtually forgotten by local citizens . Though there are many other entrances , foreign visitors entered approved sections accessed via a small shop front in Qianmen , south of Tiananmen Square , at 62 West <unk> Street . Tour groups could enter free of charge and without prior permission while individual tourists not part of a group were charged 20 yuan ( US $ 2 @.@ 40 ) each . 
 The official tour took visitors only on a small circular stretch of the Underground City . Inside the complex , visitors could see signposts to major landmarks accessible by the tunnels , such as Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City , and could see chambers labeled with their original functions , such as cinemas , hospitals , or arsenals . A portrait of Mao Zedong could be seen amidst murals of locals volunteering to dig the tunnels and fading slogans such as " <unk> Grain " , and " For the People : Prepare for War , Prepare for Famine " . Rooms with bunk beds and decayed cardboard boxes of water purifiers could be seen in areas not open to tourists . Visitors on the official tour would also pass by a functioning silk factory in one of the underground staff meeting rooms of the complex , and be given a demonstration of the process of obtaining silk from silkworm cocoons . They had a chance to buy souvenirs at a tourists ' shop operated by the state @-@ owned Qianmen Arts and Crafts Center and the China Kai Tian Silk Company .

 Bangladesh competed in the 2011 Commonwealth Youth Games ( officially known as the IV Commonwealth Youth Games ) held in the Isle of Man from 7 to 13 September 2011 . This was their second appearance in the Commonwealth Youth Games . The nation was represented by the Bangladesh Olympic Association , which is responsible for the Commonwealth Games and Commonwealth Youth Games in Bangladesh . 
 The Bangladeshi delegation consisted of four officials and four competitors : two men and two women , who took part in three different sports — athletics , boxing and swimming . ( At the previous Commonwealth Youth Games , Bangladesh had a delegation of ten athletes . ) None of the athletes won any medals . Papia Rani Sarkar finished sixth in the semifinal round of the 100 metres for women ; bantamweight boxer Riyad Hossen received a bye into the quarterfinal , but then lost to <unk> Mutapa of Zambia . In the swimming heats , Sonia Akter finished 22nd in the 50 m backstroke and 19th in the 50 m butterfly , and Anik Islam finished 12th in the 50 m butterfly and 14th in the 100 m butterfly .

Bangladesh did not participate in the first two Commonwealth Youth Games in Edinburgh ( 2000 ) and Bendigo ( 2004 ) . For the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games in Pune , India , it entered ten athletes , all men , who competed in athletics , boxing and shooting , winning one bronze medal in Weightlifting . Bangladesh was one of the 63 nations and territories taking part in the 2011 Commonwealth Youth Games held in the Isle of Man from 7 to 13 September 2011 , making its second appearance in the games .

 = Saegusa – Ito oxidation = 
 The Saegusa – Ito oxidation is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry . It was discovered in 1978 by Takeo Saegusa and Yoshihiko Ito as a method to introduce α @-@ β unsaturation in carbonyl compounds . The reaction as originally reported involved formation of a silyl enol ether followed by treatment with palladium ( II ) acetate and benzoquinone to yield the corresponding enone . The original publication noted its utility for regeneration of unsaturation following 1 @,@ 4 @-@ addition with nucleophiles such as <unk> . 
 For acyclic substrates the reaction yields the thermodynamic E @-@ olefin product exclusively . 
 This discovery was preceded nearly eight years earlier by a report that treatment of unactivated ketones with palladium acetate yielded the same products in low yields . The major improvement provided by Saegusa and Ito was the recognition that the enol form was the reactive species , developing a method based on silyl enol ethers . 
 <unk> is actually not a necessary component for this reaction ; its role is to regenerate palladium ( II ) from its reduced form palladium ( 0 ) , so that a smaller amount of expensive palladium ( II ) acetate is required at the beginning . The reaction conditions and purifications could be easily simplified by just using excess of palladium ( II ) acetate without benzoquinone , while at a much higher cost . Since the reaction typically employs near @-@ stoichiometric amounts of palladium and is therefore often considered too expensive for industrial usage , some progress has been made in the development of catalytic variants . Despite this shortcoming , the Saegusa oxidation has been used in a number of syntheses as a mild , late @-@ stage method for introduction of functionality in complex molecules . 
 = = Mechanism = = 
 The mechanism of the Saegusa – Ito oxidation involves coordination of palladium to the enol olefin followed by loss of the silyl group and formation of an <unk> @-@ palladium <unk> β @-@ hydride elimination yields the palladium hydride enone complex which upon reductive elimination yields the product along with acetic acid and <unk> . The reversibility of the elimination step allows equilibration , leading to the thermodynamic E @-@ selectivity in acyclic substrates . It has been shown that the product can form a stable <unk> @-@ olefin complex , which may be responsible for the difficulty with re @-@ oxidation seen in catalytic variants of the reaction . 
 = = Scope = = 
 The wide applicability of the Saegusa – Ito oxidation is exemplified by its use in several classic syntheses of complex molecules . The synthesis of morphine by Tohru Fukuyama in 2006 is one such example , in which the transformation tolerates the presence of carbamate and ether substituents . 
 Samuel J. Danishefsky 's synthesis of both ( + ) and ( - ) <unk> began with a Saegusa – Ito oxidation of the Diels @-@ Alder adduct of <unk> and 3 @-@ <unk> @-@ 1 @,@ 3 @-@ butadiene to yield the enone below . In this case the oxidation tolerated the presence of alkene and carbonyl moieties . 
 Yong Qiang Tu 's synthesis of the Alzheimer 's disease medication <unk> likewise used this reaction in the presence of an acid @-@ sensitive <unk> group . 
 Larry E. Overman 's synthesis of <unk> utilizes a one @-@ pot oxidation with <unk> <unk> followed by a Saegusa oxidation , tolerating the presence of a halogen and a sulfonate . 
 The synthesis of <unk> reported by David Williams uses a novel Saegusa – Ito oxidation involving an unprotected enol moiety . The enone product <unk> in situ to regenerate the enol and form the <unk> ring . Subsequent deprotection of the <unk> group furnished the natural product . 
 = = Variations = = 
 The vast majority of improvements to this reaction have focused on rendering the transformation catalytic with respect to the palladium salt , primarily due to its high cost . The original conditions , though technically catalytic , still require 50 mol % of palladium ( II ) <unk> , raising the cost to prohibitively high levels for large scale syntheses . 
 The major advances in catalytic versions of this reaction have steered towards co @-@ oxidants that regenerate the palladium ( II ) species effectively . Specifically , conditions using atmospheric oxygen as well as stoichiometric <unk> have been developed . 
 With respect to the former , the method developed by <unk> in 1995 represents an environmentally and cost @-@ attractive method as a catalytic substitute for the Saegusa – Ito oxidation . 
 This method suffers from long reaction times and often produces significantly lower yields than the stoichiometric equivalent as showcased in the synthesis of <unk> by Nishida . The contrast of the two methods highlights the catalytic method 's shortcomings . 
 Catalytic variants employing stoichiometric <unk> and other <unk> carbonates have also been developed , primarily by Jiro Tsuji . For these the choice of solvent is essential : nitrile solvents produce the desired enones while ethereal solvents produce α @-@ allyl ketones instead . 
 This latter method has enjoyed greater success as a synthetic tool , most notably in the Shibasaki total synthesis of the famous poison <unk> . 
 Despite these methods , much work remains to be done with regard to catalytic installation of α @-@ β unsaturation . 
 = Wilco = 
 Wilco is an American alternative rock band based in Chicago , Illinois . The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo following singer Jay Farrar 's departure . Wilco 's lineup changed frequently during its first decade , with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation . Since early 2004 , the lineup has been unchanged , consisting of Tweedy , Stirratt , guitarist Nels Cline , multi @-@ instrumentalist Pat Sansone , keyboard player Mikael Jorgensen , and drummer Glenn Kotche . Wilco has released nine studio albums , a live double album , and four collaborations : three with Billy Bragg and one with The Minus 5 . 
 Wilco 's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles , including Bill Fay , The Beatles and Television , and has in turn influenced music by a number of modern alternative rock acts . The band continued in the alternative country of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A.M. ( 1995 ) , but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music , including elements of alternative rock and classic pop . Wilco 's musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current " eclectic indie rock collective that touches on many eras and genres . " 
 Wilco garnered media attention for their fourth album , Yankee Hotel Foxtrot ( 2002 ) , and the controversy surrounding it . After the recording sessions were complete , Reprise Records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label . As part of a buy @-@ out deal , Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free . After streaming Foxtrot on its website , Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002 . Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group , leading one critic to say the album showed " how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty @-@ first century . " Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is Wilco 's most successful release to date , selling over 670 @,@ 000 copies . Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album , 2004 's A Ghost Is Born , including Best Alternative Music Album . Wilco 's released their ninth studio album , Star Wars , on July 16 , 2015 . On July 19 , 2016 Wilco set the release date for their tenth studio album , Schmilco , for September 9 , 2016 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Formation = = = 
 Wilco was formed following the breakup of the influential alternative country music group Uncle Tupelo . Singer Jay Farrar quit the band in 1994 because of a soured relationship with co @-@ singer Jeff Tweedy . Both Tweedy and Farrar sought to form bands immediately after the breakup . Tweedy was able to keep the entire Uncle Tupelo lineup sans Farrar , including bassist John Stirratt , drummer Ken Coomer , and multi @-@ instrumentalist Max Johnston . He even enlisted Uncle Tupelo guest guitarist Brian Henneman of the Bottle Rockets , who performed on many of the tracks for Wilco 's debut album , A.M .. The band was tempted to keep the Uncle Tupelo name , but ultimately decided to rename the band . The group named itself " Wilco " after the military and commercial aviation radio voice abbreviation for " will comply " , a choice which Tweedy has called " fairly ironic for a rock band to name themselves . " 
 = = = A.M. and Being There = = = 
 After collaborating with Syd Straw on a cover version of the Ernest Tubb song " The T.B. is Whipping Me " ( released in September 1994 on the Red Hot + Country compilation produced by the Red Hot Organization ) , Wilco began recording tracks for A.M. , their first studio album , at Easley studio in June 1994 . A demo tape from these recordings was sent to executives at Reprise Records , a subsidiary of Warner Brothers , and the label signed Tweedy to a contract . Although Tweedy stated that he wanted a more collaborative project than Uncle Tupelo , only his name appeared on the Reprise contract . Tweedy requested songwriting submissions from other members , but only one submission — John Stirratt 's " It 's Just That Simple " — appeared on A.M .. It was the last song Wilco ever released that was lyrically solely written by a member besides Tweedy . 
 Stylistically similar to Uncle Tupelo , the music on A.M. was considered to be straightforward alternative country rock in what Tweedy later described as " trying to tread some water with a perceived audience . " A.M. peaked at number twenty @-@ seven on the Billboard Heatseekers chart , considerably lower than the debut album of Jay Farrar 's new band , Son Volt . The album was met with modest reviews though it would rank thirty @-@ fourth in the Village Voice 's 1995 Pazz & Jop critics poll . Critically and commercially paling in comparison to the reception of Son Volt 's album , the Wilco members perceived A.M. to be a failure . Shortly after the release of the album , multi @-@ instrumentalist Jay Bennett joined the band , providing the band with a keyboardist and another guitarist . 
 Wilco made its live debut on November 17 , 1994 to a capacity crowd at Cicero 's Basement Bar in St. Louis , Missouri ( the band was billed for the occasion as " Black Shampoo " ) . 
 During the two hundred @-@ date tour supporting A.M. , Tweedy began to write songs for a second album . The lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener ; Tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base . Ken Coomer elaborated : 
 The whole No Depression thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that Jeff was a bigger punk @-@ rock fan than a country fan . It led to things like us all switching instruments on " Misunderstood , " where I 'm playing guitar . 
 A number of songs were recorded with this theme , including " Sunken Treasure " and " Hotel Arizona " , however , Wilco also recorded a number of songs in the style of A.M. Wilco named the album Being There after a Peter Sellers film of the same name . The band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions . Max Johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of Bennett ; he had also been replaced by violinist Jesse Greene on one track because the band felt that Johnston was unable to play the part . Bob Egan of Freakwater briefly joined the band in the studio , playing pedal steel guitar on " Far , Far Away " and " Dreamer in My Dreams " , and then became an official member in September 1996 . 
 Unlike the A.M. recording sessions , the band had no vocation for producing a hit song from their second effort . The recording sessions produced nineteen songs , too many for a single album release . Tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a double album would be sold for ( at least $ 30 ) , so he asked Reprise Records to release it as a double album at a single album price ( $ 17 @.@ 98 or less ) . Reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received Wilco 's share of the album royalties . It was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost $ 600 @,@ 000 on the deal , but Tweedy was satisfied . Being There was well received by critics from several major media outlets , including Rolling Stone . The album reached No. 73 on the Billboard album charts , a significant improvement from A.M. , and placed fourteenth on the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1996 . The album 's single " Outtasite ( Outta Mind ) " became the group 's first song to enter the Billboard charts , reaching No. 39 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 22 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart . 
 = = = Summerteeth and the Mermaid Avenue sessions = = = 
 In November 1997 , Wilco entered Willie Nelson 's recording studio in Spicewood , Texas to record a third studio album . The album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of Tweedy and his wife , as well as by twentieth @-@ century literature . Tweedy relied heavily on Bennett to provide music for the singer 's " bold , but depressing " lyrics . Wilco recorded several songs , including " Via Chicago " and " She 's a Jar , " but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an album . 
 Nora Guthrie contacted singer @-@ songwriter Billy Bragg in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father , folk singer Woody Guthrie . Most of the songs were written late in Guthrie 's life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of Huntington 's disease . By the 1990s , Woody Guthrie had become a " relic " to the MTV generation , and Nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician . To Nora , Bragg was " the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody . " Bragg was concerned , however , that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by Guthrie when he performed them on tour , so he decided to record the album with another band . 
 Bragg contacted Tweedy and Bennett about co @-@ recording the album while Wilco was on the European segment of their Being There tour . Bragg was particularly fond of Being There because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s . Although Tweedy was indifferent to the offer , Bennett was enthused about recording songs of one of his idols — Bennett 's previous band Titanic Love Affair was named after a Billy Bragg lyric . A recording contract between Bragg and Wilco was signed after a show at Shepherd 's Bush Empire . Bragg mostly recorded the politically charged lyrics , while Tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased Guthrie as a " freak weirdo " . The recording of Mermaid Avenue began on December 12 , 1997 , and was the topic of BBC 's Man in the Sand documentary film . 
 Tempers flared between Bragg and Wilco after the album was completed . Bennett believed that Bragg was overproducing his songs , a sharp contrast to Wilco 's sparser contributions . Bennett called Bragg about the possibility of remixing Bragg 's songs , to which Bragg responded " you make your record , and I 'll make mine , fucker . " Eventually Bragg sent copies of his recordings to Chicago for Bennett to remix , but Bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album . The two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician fees . 
 Despite these conflicts , the album was released on June 23 , 1998 , and sold over 277 @,@ 000 copies . The album received rave reviews from Robert Christgau and Rolling Stone , and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album . It also placed fourth on the Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1998 . After the album was released , Bob Egan was replaced by multi @-@ instrumentalist Leroy Bach . 
 After the completion of the Mermaid Avenue sessions , Wilco returned to Spicewood to complete their third studio album , Summerteeth . Unlike previous Wilco and Uncle Tupelo recordings , the album featured a lot of overdubbing with Pro Tools . Stirratt and Coomer were concerned with the production , since it reduced their involvement in the music . According to Stirratt : 
 The story of Summerteeth is Jay bought a Mellotron and he was going to use it , no matter what . It was lovely , but it was overdone . Once they got going on the overdubs , they didn 't stop . And nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness ... It reminds me of Heart of Darkness , where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption , or whatever it is you 're looking for . 
 During 1999 , Warner Brothers was looking to help repay a $ 16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company Warner Communications with Time Inc .. As a result , Warner 's imprints were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records . The head of Reprise , Howie Klein , who had previously authorized the release of Being There as a double album , was willing to let Wilco produce Summerteeth without label input . When Klein played the album for Reprise 's A & R department , however , they demanded a radio single for the album . Wilco agreed to do this " once and once only " and recorded a radio @-@ friendly version of " Can 't Stand It " at the request of David Kahne , the head of the A & R department . The single version of " Can 't Stand It " failed to cross over from Triple @-@ A radio to alternative rock stations . Consequently , the album sold only 200 @,@ 000 copies , significantly less than Being There . This was despite critical acclaim ; the album placed eighth on the Pazz & Jop critics ' poll for 1999 . 
 After the release of Summerteeth , the band resumed the Mermaid Avenue sessions . Although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998 , Wilco recorded a few new songs for Mermaid Avenue Vol . II . " Someday Some Morning Sometime , " featuring a vibraphone filtered through a space echo , was identified by Tweedy as being the " piece to the puzzle " towards the creation of their fourth studio album . The album was released on May 30 , 2000 , and was the last release from the sessions . The remainder of the sessions were released in 2012 as Mermaid Avenue Vol . III , also part of Mermaid Avenue : The Complete Sessions . 
 = = = Yankee Hotel Foxtrot = = = 
 Shortly after the recording sessions for Mermaid Avenue Vol . II , Wilco purchased a studio on Irving Park Road in Chicago , which they named the Wilco Loft . The band recorded some tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album . In May 2000 , Jeff Tweedy requested to perform with Jim O 'Rourke at a festival in Chicago ; Tweedy was a fan of O 'Rourke 's Bad Timing . O 'Rourke introduced Tweedy to drummer Glenn Kotche , and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named Loose Fur . Wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point , but Tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts . He enjoyed Kotche 's contributions to Loose Fur so much that Tweedy brought him into the studio to re @-@ record some demos . Some believe that Tweedy sought to make Wilco sound like Loose Fur after officially replacing Ken Coomer with Kotche in January 2001 . 
 Although Bennett sought to act as both mixer and engineer for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot , Tweedy was unsure of Bennett 's abilities against those of O 'Rourke . Tweedy and Bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener , or attempt to cover new musical ground . Unbeknownst to Bennett , Tweedy invited O 'Rourke to remix " I Am Trying to Break Your Heart " , and the results impressed the other band members — even Bennett . Tensions grew between Bennett and O 'Rourke because Bennett wanted to mix every song on the album . O 'Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs ; some songs , such as " Poor Places " , only featured the Loose Fur trio . The album was completed in 2001 , and Bennett was dismissed from the band immediately afterwards . The recording of the album was documented by Sam Jones and released in 2002 as the film I Am Trying to Break Your Heart : A Film About Wilco . 
 Time Warner , which owned Warner Bros. Records , merged with America Online in 2001 , leading to more pressure on Warner 's record labels to cut costs . Over 600 employees of Warner Music Group were fired , including Howie Klein , the president of Reprise Records . In absence of Klein , David Kahne became the interim head of Reprise . Kahne assigned Mio <unk> to monitor the progress of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and to offer suggestions . Music journalist Greg Kot claims that <unk> disdained the album and was unhappy that Wilco ignored his suggestions . He brought the album to Kahne , who felt that there was no single on the album . In June 2001 , the album was rejected by Reprise and Wilco was asked to leave the label . 
 Wilco managed to negotiate terms to a buy @-@ out from Reprise . Music journalist Greg Kot claims that instead of financial compensation , the band agreed to leave the label with the master tapes of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot . The label was already receiving bad publicity for its treatment of the band and were willing to accommodate Wilco 's request . However , Allmusic claims that Wilco " bought the finished studio tapes from Warner / Reprise for a reported $ 50 @,@ 000 and left the label altogether " after Wilco was " [ u ] <unk> to change the album to make it more ' commercially viable ' " To curb the negative publicity , Reprise began to invest more in bands such as The Flaming Lips . Lead singer Wayne Coyne once remarked : 
 We are benefiting from the label 's regret over Wilco . We are living in the golden age of that being such a public mistake . The people on Warners said , " we 'll never have a band like Wilco feel we don 't believe in them again . " They 'd tell me that it would never happen to us . And what a great day for me ! 
 As the band searched for a new label to release the album , they decided to stream it at their official website to discourage illegal trading of low @-@ quality MP3s . The band signed with Nonesuch Records , another Time Warner subsidiary , and the album was released in the spring of 2002 . When it was released , Yankee Hotel Foxtrot reached number thirteen on the Billboard 200 , Wilco 's highest chart position to that date . Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sold over 590 @,@ 000 copies , and to date remains Wilco 's best selling album . Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was met with wide critical acclaim : it topped 2002 's Pazz & Jop critics ' poll , was named one of the 100 greatest albums of all time by Q Magazine . 
 Rolling Stone rated it one of the top 500 albums of all time in May 2012 . 
 = = = Down with Wilco , A Ghost Is Born , and Kicking Television : Live in Chicago = = = 
 While waiting for the commercial release of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot , Wilco agreed to support R.E.M. collaborator Scott McCaughey for an album release by The Minus 5 . They scheduled a recording session for September 11 , 2001 , but were distraught about the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks that day . Later that day , Wilco and McCaughey agreed to " create something good in the world right now " and record some material . Influenced by Bill Fay 's Time of the Last Persecution , The Minus 5 's Down with Wilco was released in 2003 . Keyboardist Mikael Jorgensen , who had engineered Down with Wilco , joined Wilco in 2002 as they toured in support of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot . 
 In November 2003 , Wilco traveled to New York City to record their fifth album . The album was produced by Jim O 'Rourke , who mixed Foxtrot and was a member of Wilco side project Loose Fur . Unlike Summerteeth and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot , A Ghost Is Born featured songs that were created with Pro Tools before ever performing them live . The album featured the song " Less Than You Think " , which included a fifteen @-@ minute track of electronic noises and synthesizers , which Tweedy called " the track that everyone will hate " . Tweedy justified the inclusion of the song : 
 I know ninety @-@ nine percent of our fans won 't like that song , they 'll say it 's a ridiculous indulgence . Even I don 't want to listen to it every time I play through the album . But the times I do calm myself down and pay attention to it , I think it 's valuable and moving and cathartic . I wouldn 't have put it on the record if I didn 't think it was great ... I wanted to make an album about identity , and within that is the idea of a higher power , the idea of randomness , and that anything can happen , and that we can 't control it . 
 Leroy Bach left the band immediately after the album 's completion to join a music theatre operation in Chicago . Like Yankee Hotel Foxtrot , Wilco streamed the album online before its commercial release . Instead of using their own web page , the band streamed it in MPEG @-@ 4 form on Apple 's website . Wilco sought to substantially change their lineup after Bach 's departure , and added Pat Sansone of The Autumn Defense , and avant @-@ garde guitarist Nels Cline to the lineup . Just as the band was about to tour to promote the album , Tweedy checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago for an addiction to opioids . As a result , tour plans for Europe were canceled , and the release date for the album was set back several weeks . A Ghost Is Born was released on June 22 , 2004 , and became Wilco 's first top ten album in the U.S. The album earned Wilco Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package in 2005 . It also placed thirteenth on 2004 's Pazz & Jop Critics Poll . 
 In 2004 , the band released The Wilco Book , a picture book detailing the creation of A Ghost Is Born . The book also contains writings and drawings from band members , as well as a CD with demos from the A Ghost Is Born recording sessions . Also that year , Chicago Tribune music critic Greg Kot released a biography of the band entitled Wilco : Learning How to Die . The new six @-@ piece Wilco lineup debuted on Kicking Television : Live in Chicago , a two disc live album recorded at The Vic Theater in Chicago . Released on November 15 , 2005 , the album received high accolades from Spin , Billboard , and Entertainment Weekly . As of 2007 , it has sold over 114 @,@ 000 copies . 
 = = = Sky Blue Sky = = = 
 Wilco returned to their loft in Chicago to record a sixth studio album in 2006 . Influenced by The Byrds and Fairport Convention , the band considered Sky Blue Sky to be less experimental than previous releases . Also unlike previous albums , the songs were created as collaborations . 
 Wilco streamed the album online on March 3 , 2007 , and offered the song " What Light " as a free MP3 download . To further publicize the album , Wilco licensed several songs from the Sky Blue Sky recording sessions for use in a Volkswagen advertising campaign . The move was criticized by both critics and fans ; Wilco responded by noting that they had previously done advertising campaigns with Apple Inc. and Telefónica <unk> ( Movistar ) . The album was released on May 15 , 2007 , and was a commercial success : it sold over 87 @,@ 000 copies in its first week and peaked in the top five in the U.S. album charts . It also was a top forty hit in seven other countries . 
 Reviewer James Brubaker states that Wilco " shine [ s ] on a handful of the songs " on Sky Blue Sky , such as the " light , and straightforward " songs . While he calls the album " great traditional rock and folk album at times " , he states that " once you get past the handful of masterful and lovely performances ... the rest of the record comes off at times as dull , and forced . " The <unk> review also had mixed comments . While praising the album as " deceptively insinuating , almost intoxicating to listen to " and noting its " impeccable sound quality , " the reviewer claimed that " Sky Blue Sky becomes the first Wilco album that sounds too careful for its own good . " 
 <unk> Hernandez , a reviewer for Lost at Sea praised the album 's " breezy atmosphere and pacing , " and noted that it is not " easily judged upon first listen . " Overall , Hernandez stated that it " may be no masterpiece , but at worst it 's a more than worthy entry into Wilco 's laudable catalogue . " Reviewer Greg Locke praised the record as " one of the best albums of the year , " calling it a " timeless record , full of sweet , hopeful sophistication and class " and " a lean , mean , soulful album . " Like Hernandez , Locke acknowledged that the album could not be properly judged just on the first listening . The NPR review also had a positive take on the record . While the NPR reviewer stated that the recording " isn 't groundbreaking , " they praised its " coherent musical expression " and emphasis on " solid songcraft without pretense " which created a " satisfying and melodically sound album . " 
 In anticipation of the 2008 US presidential election , Wilco released a downloadable version of Bob Dylan 's " I Shall Be Released " that they performed with Fleet Foxes .

 = = Musical style and influence = = 
 Wilco 's music is typically categorized as alternative rock and alternative country . Despite their career @-@ long association with a major record label , they are generally associated with indie rock . Wilco draws influence from bands from a variety of musical genres , but primarily from music created between 1966 and 1974 . John Cale 's Paris 1919 was credited by the band as providing a musical parallel . According to Tweedy , " It was eye @-@ opening that I wasn 't the only person that felt like these worlds had a lot more in common than they 'd been given credit for — that experimentation and avant @-@ garde theory was not directly opposed to beauty , y 'know ? " 
 Other recording artists from that timespan appreciated by the band include John Lennon , Neil Young , and Brian Wilson . For his thirty @-@ fourth birthday , Tweedy received a private guitar lesson from Richard Lloyd of Television ; Tweedy was a fan of the group and was particularly fond of the guitar work , which he wanted to incorporate into his music . Uncle Tupelo was inspired by bands such as Jason & the Scorchers and The Minutemen , influencing the recording of Wilco 's A.M .. Tweedy and O 'Rourke enjoyed free jazz artists such as Ornette Coleman , Albert Ayler , and Derek Bailey ; they also listen to mainstream jazz by artists such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane . The lyrical structure of Wilco 's songs was dictated by classic literature and cadavre <unk> — an exercise where band members take turns writing lines on a typewriter , but are only allowed to see the previously written line . Among the books that the band has cited as being stylistically influential include William H. Gass 's In the Heart of the Heart of the Country , Henry Miller 's Tropic of Cancer , and Harold Bloom 's The Anxiety of Influence : A Theory of Poetry . 
 Some critics have dubbed Wilco the " American Radiohead " , due to their stylistically diverse catalog . A critic from the New York Times argues that Wilco has a " roots @-@ rock ... [ sound which ] reached back to proven materials : the twang of country , the steady chug of 1960s rock , the undulating sheen of the Beach Boys , the honky @-@ tonk hymns of the Band and the melodic symmetries of pop . " 
 Rolling Stone described Wilco as " one of America 's most consistently interesting bands " and " America 's foremost rock impressionists . " Bands that have been influenced by Wilco include Derek Webb ( of Caedmon 's Call ) , The National , and Grace Potter and the <unk> . English indie rock band Cherry Ghost took its name from a lyric from the Wilco song " Theologians " ( from A Ghost Is Born ) — lead singer Simon Aldred is a self @-@ proclaimed " massive Wilco fan " . Other notable artists who have covered Wilco live include Norah Jones performing " Jesus , Etc . " which took place at the 2008 Bridge School Benefit where they both performed , a version of which was released as a bonus track on her 2009 release The Fall , Widespread Panic , and Counting Crows and the Wallflowers performing " California Stars .

 = 1899 New Richmond tornado = 
 The 1899 New Richmond Tornado was an estimated F5 tornado that nearly destroyed the town of New Richmond , Wisconsin , on June 12 , 1899 , killing 117 and injuring 125 people . More than $ 300 @,@ 000 ( USD ) ( $ 8 @,@ 533 @,@ 000 in today 's dollars ) in damage was reported . 
 = = History = = 
 June 12 , 1899 , was the day of the <unk> Brothers Circus , which drew hundreds of visitors in addition to the town 's 2 @,@ 500 inhabitants . Around 3 : 00 p.m. , clouds began to build , and the sky became quite dark . As the circus ended for the day around 4 : 30 PM , a heavy rain , with some hail , began to fall . The rain let up around 5 : 00 PM , and people began to head home for the day . By 6 : 00 PM , the streets of New Richmond were full of tourists , travelers and residents . 
 Meanwhile , the tornado had already touched down to the southwest . It began as a waterspout on the east bank of Lake St. Croix , about 15 miles ( 24 @.@ 1 km ) from New Richmond , at around 5 : 30 PM . The tornado was described as a " boiling cloud " , which seemed to skirt the hills to the east of Lake St. Croix , and then head straight for New Richmond . Passing over mostly open country , it destroyed several farm buildings near the rural communities of Burkhardt and Boardman as it traveled northeast . Three people were killed there . 
 There was little warning in New Richmond . The tornado was completely illuminated by lightning , but it was visible for only a few minutes before it reached the town . Homes and businesses were demolished and torn from their foundations , flying debris filled the air , and people were swept away . The brick , three @-@ story <unk> Hotel was completely leveled by the tornado . Some barely had time to scramble for shelter in storm cellars , but many were caught in the streets . Even some who did take refuge were killed anyway , such as those who ran into the O.J. Williams dry goods store . The store was swept away , and the people taking shelter in the basement were pelted to death by flying bricks and timbers . Most people who could not find shelter were killed . Debris of all sorts flew through the air at tremendous speeds . A 3 @,@ 000 pound safe was flung a block from its original location . Trees and timbers were hurled " like javelins " through the air , and the intense winds swept people up and threw them against walls or the ground . The northern residential section of town was completely obliterated by the tornado , with nothing left but small pieces of debris scattered about . Every home in that area was leveled or swept away . The tornado dissipated shortly after exiting the town . 
 Shortly thereafter , another storm with strong winds swept through , sending people back into their shelters . It is likely that some died in fires while potential help was hiding from the possibility of another tornado . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 All but the extreme western end of the town was obliterated by the tornado and subsequent fires . More than 300 buildings were destroyed , and the only significant surviving structures were the Catholic and Baptist churches . The town 's electrical plant and water facilities were destroyed , so fires ran rampant through the scattered debris . Many bodies found in the aftermath were burnt beyond recognition — it was impossible to tell if they died from the tornado or from being trapped and burned alive . 
 Twenty @-@ six families experienced multiple deaths , and six reported four or more deaths in the family . After order was restored , authorities determined that a total of 117 people had been killed ( 64 in the town itself ) and more than 150 injured . This is the ninth highest death toll for any single tornado in American history . The New Richmond Tornado is generally assumed to have been an F5 tornado , with winds in excess of 261 mph . 
 The town was so completely damaged that it had to be essentially rebuilt . Damage claims exceeded $ 300 @,@ 000 ( $ 7 million in 2006 dollars ) , however , damages may have been as high as $ 600 @,@ 000 ( $ 14 million in 2006 dollars ) . 
 = Charlotte ( anime ) = 
 Charlotte ( <unk> , <unk> ) is a 13 @-@ episode Japanese anime television series produced by P.A.Works and Aniplex and directed by Yoshiyuki Asai . The anime aired in Japan between July 5 and September 27 , 2015 . An original video animation episode was released in March 2016 . Two manga series are serialized in ASCII Media Works ' Dengeki G 's Comic . The story takes place in an alternate reality where a small percentage of children manifest superhuman abilities upon reaching puberty . A focus is placed on Yuu Otosaka , a high school boy who awakens the ability to temporarily possess others , which brings him to the attention of Nao Tomori , the student council president of a school founded as a haven for children with such abilities . 
 The story was originally conceived by Jun Maeda , who also wrote the screenplay and composed some of the music , with original character design by Na @-@ Ga . Both Maeda and Na @-@ Ga are from the visual novel brand Key , and Charlotte is the second original anime series created by Key following Angel Beats ! in 2010 . Maeda had thought up the concept for Charlotte long before he was approached in early 2012 to work on another anime series after Angel Beats ! . Maeda narrowed down the number of main characters compared to Angel Beats ! and attempted to put more of a focus on their behavior . Instead of employing the same staff that had worked on Angel Beats ! , the aim for Charlotte was to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process to prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats ! . 
 Charlotte was praised for its unpredictability and evocative moments , but its pacing and structure have been criticized as inefficient . It has been described as approachable for a wide audience and for defying the " moe anime " stereotype . Although the comedic elements have been called dumb and corny , they have overall been lauded for offering some relief from the serious moments , which one reviewer likened to a palate cleanser . P.A.Works ' production was praised for its beautiful animation sequences and expressive cinematography . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Charlotte takes place in an alternate reality where a short @-@ period comet called Charlotte passes near Earth every 75 years . When this happens , it spreads dust onto the Earth , which causes a small percentage of preadolescent children who inhale the dust to manifest superhuman abilities upon reaching puberty . The story follows the protagonist Yuu Otosaka , a boy who awakens the ability to temporarily possess others . Although hoping to use his ability to fraudulently live a carefree high school life , he is exposed by Nao Tomori , a girl who can make herself invisible to a specific target . She forces him to transfer to Hoshinoumi Academy ( <unk> , Hoshinoumi Gakuen , " Sea of Stars Academy " ) and join its student council , of which she is the president . Also on the student council is Jōjirō Takajō , a boy who can move at uncontrollably high speeds . The student council 's main objective is to ensure the safety of ability users from organizations who seek to exploit their powers . In doing so , the student council warns ability users of the potential danger of openly using their abilities . This leads the student council to Yusa Nishimori , a girl who has the ability to channel the dead as a medium . Yusa 's dead older sister Misa makes use of this ability to freely possess her at any time , which allows Misa to use her own ability , pyrokinesis . Nao soon arranges for Yusa to transfer to Hoshinoumi Academy and join the student council . 
 Yuu 's younger sister Ayumi eventually awakens an ability to cause anything around her to suddenly collapse , which results in her death . Yuu falls into a deep depression as a result and isolates himself , but Nao successfully manages to pull him out of his depression and gets him to return to the student council . While attending a concert of the post @-@ rock band Zhiend with Nao , Yuu recollects previously suppressed memories of his brother Shunsuke , who has the ability to time travel . Shunsuke had used this ability to found Hoshinoumi Academy and an affiliated organization attempting to develop a vaccine to prevent children from developing abilities before they manifest , but repeated use leaves him blind . Yuu learns that the true nature of his ability enables him to steal someone 's ability by possessing them . Yuu steals Shunsuke 's ability to go back in time and ultimately prevent Ayumi 's death by stealing her collapse ability before she can use it . 
 A terrorist group manages to abduct Nao and Kumagami , one of Shunsuke 's closest friends and aides , and holds them hostage in exchange for Yuu , who attempts to rescue them . However , the operation does not go as planned , which results in Kumagami 's death and Yuu being gravely injured . After Yuu recovers , he resolves to protect all of the ability users around the world by stealing their abilities per Nao 's suggestion . As Yuu travels the world stealing abilities , the more powers he takes on soon takes its toll on him as he starts losing his memories and sense of self . However , he still manages to steal everyone 's abilities throughout the world before collapsing , Nao 's parting gift acting as his motivation . Shunsuke rescues Yuu , bringing him back to Japan among friends and family . Yuu is left with no past memories , but Nao tells him she is his girlfriend . Yuu and his friends look forward to the memories they will make from now on as Yuu continues to recover from his ordeal .

 The original creators of Charlotte are Jun Maeda and Na @-@ Ga of Key , and Charlotte is the second original anime series created by Key following Angel Beats ! ( 2010 ) . Hironori Toba of Aniplex approached Maeda in early 2012 with an offer from P.A.Works president Kenji Horikawa to do another anime series with the studio . Maeda was surprised by this , as he never expected to work with P.A.Works again . Horikawa explained that the production staff could now handle things that were not able to be fully materialized during the production of Angel Beats ! . Maeda did not think he would ever be involved in the planning of another anime series , but he said that he had no choice but to accept Horikawa 's offer after discussing it with him . Toba asked Maeda to write a " Key @-@ like story " , and Maeda started out by applying his prior experience of working on Angel Beats ! . He went through a trial @-@ and @-@ error process to work out what kind of setting and story would work well for an anime series . 
 Long before working on Charlotte , Maeda had thought up a concept for a story with characters who have imperfect superpowers that must cooperate with each other to resolve any incidents that arise . Maeda originally submitted three separate ideas for a story to Toba , and he asked him which one he liked best . However , after Toba pointed out one of the other two , Maeda made it clear that he wanted to do the story that would become Charlotte . When writing the story , Maeda also reconsidered how he had done certain things with Angel Beats ! . In particular , he attempted to put more of a focus on the behavior of the characters . Maeda also narrowed down the number of main characters in Charlotte compared to Angel Beats ! , which could not put a focus on each and every character . Toba felt that Maeda was influenced by his work on Angel Beats ! , which changed his thought process and what he wanted to depict in Charlotte . 
 Maeda thought issues had arisen with the large cast of characters in Angel Beats ! , such as overlapping personality traits and not being able to remember everyone , and he used those considerations when writing Charlotte . Similarly , when designing the characters in Angel Beats ! , Na @-@ Ga had been concerned about designs being too similar among the characters , and went on to make use of that experience with Charlotte . When developing Jōjirō Takajō , he originally had a different appearance and personality , but over the course of the development process , he eventually became similar to Takamatsu from Angel Beats ! . Maeda decided fairly early on to make Yuu Otosaka a low @-@ life cheater at the start of Charlotte because he had never created a character like that before . When trying to choose a title for Charlotte , Maeda 's friend Taisei Nakagawa proposed a title which could be abbreviated as " AA " based on its similarity to Angel Beats ! ' s abbreviation of " AB " . However , Maeda did not like the title , and devised the title Charlotte as one that would surpass the original " AA " title . The title Charlotte came from the song " Charlotte " ( <unk> , <unk> ) by the Japanese band Art @-@ School . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 When deciding on Charlotte 's staff , Toba thought it would be better not to have exactly the same team that produced Angel Beats ! . Having already decided to stick with Maeda , Na @-@ Ga and P.A.Works , Toba aimed to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process , and in doing so would prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats ! . With that in mind , Toba wanted a director who had a good understanding of Angel Beats ! and who would also be suitable as Charlotte 's director , leading him to seek out Yoshiyuki Asai . Toba took into consideration the storyboarding Asai had done for two episodes of Angel Beats ! , and he thought that Charlotte would be a good opportunity to have a first @-@ time series director . Asai was also chosen as someone who could handle both comedic and serious moments . When Horikawa first looked at Charlotte 's incomplete script , he told Maeda that it did not feel like it had the same kind of zeal that Angel Beats ! had . However , once he saw the whole script , his concerns with it were dispelled , much to Maeda 's relief . 
 While the entire script was still in the draft phase , Maeda revised lines that felt unnatural after asking others for their opinions on it , including Na @-@ Ga . When writing the script , Maeda made a conscious effort to write Charlotte in the framework of an anime series , as opposed to when he wrote the script for Angel Beats ! , which he admits he wrote more akin to the framework of a video game . In this way , Toba felt that Charlotte was Maeda 's effort to write a story in its purest form that could not be made into a video game , unlike Angel Beats ! . Toba also noted that the characters in Charlotte are not written for a video game scenario , especially the protagonist , and went on to echo Horikawa 's sentiment that Charlotte is akin to an I novel for Maeda . Toba explained that this is a result of Maeda 's effort to remove the restrictions that come from writing the scenario for a video game .

 In a review by Anime News Network , reviewer Gabriella Ekens praised the series for " sculpting singular , evocative moments " , but went on to say that a " problem arises when you try to tie them into a bigger picture . " Ekens criticized the pacing and structure of the show , calling it an " inefficient ... collection of sprawling narrative ideas " and comparing it to " <unk> suddenly turn [ ing ] into Darker than Black . " Ekens also notes that its thematic purpose " seems to be Jun Maeda 's opportunity for melodramatic elaboration on the emotional dilemmas posed by Madoka Magica . " Overall , Charlotte was lauded for its entertainment value and unpredictability , but " disappoints as a work of art . " Early on , Ekens described the series as having " sharp comedic timing , " and by episode four , she praised the comedic elements as " already much funnier than Plastic Memories . " She went on to say that " it 's dumb , but I like it for the same reasons I liked the comedy in Seraph of the End : Vampire Reign . " Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post found Charlotte 's unpredictability " engaging " and its animation " beautiful " . Ekens praised P.A. Works for their dynamic direction and " expressive cinematography " which offers " a distinct , pleasant aesthetic . " 
 In a column on Mainichi Shimbun 's <unk> portal , Charlotte was praised for the balance it strikes to reach a wide audience , from " core fans " of anime to casual viewers , in regards to its creative use of peculiar characters coupled with a scenario focused on resolving problems . Columnist Ryō <unk> commended Charlotte for pulling in the viewer from the first episode due to Yuu 's surprising , unorthodox personality in contrast with how he uses his superhuman ability in his everyday life . Writer Seiji Nakazawa lauded Charlotte for defying the " moe anime " stereotype at first glance and for instead being what he describes as a " human drama " . He notes that Charlotte is written in much the same way as Maeda 's previous works by inserting jokes between serious moments to offer some relief to the viewer . While Nakazawa admits that some may find the jokes in Charlotte corny , he finds them acceptable and likens them to a palate cleanser .

 = War of the Worlds ( 2005 film ) = 
 War of the Worlds is a 2005 American science fiction disaster film directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Josh Friedman and David Koepp , loosely based on the novel of the same title by H. G. Wells . It stars Tom Cruise , Dakota Fanning , Justin Chatwin , Miranda Otto and Tim Robbins , with narration by Morgan Freeman . In the film , an American dock worker is forced to look after his children , from whom he lives separately , and struggles to protect them and reunite them with their mother when extraterrestrials invade the Earth and devastate cities with towering war machines . 
 The film was shot in 73 days , using five different sound stages as well as locations in California , Connecticut , New Jersey , New York , and Virginia . The film was surrounded by a secrecy campaign so few details would be leaked before its release . Tie @-@ in promotions were made with several companies , including Hitachi . The film was released in the United States on June 29 and in United Kingdom on July 1 . War of the Worlds was a box office success , and became 2005 's fourth most successful film both domestically , with $ 234 million in North America , and $ 591 million overall . At the time of release , it was the highest @-@ grossing film starring Tom Cruise . 
 = = Plot = = 
 A narrator explains how humans were unaware that a race of intelligent extraterrestrials were making plans to occupy Earth . Ray Ferrier is a divorced crane operator longshoreman who works at a dock in Brooklyn and lives in Bayonne , NJ . Ray is estranged from his children . His former wife , Mary Ann , later drops off the children , ten @-@ year @-@ old daughter Rachel and teenage son Robbie , at Ray 's house in Bayonne on her way to visit her parents in Boston . Unexplained changes in the weather occur , including lightning that strikes multiple times in the middle of an intersection and disrupts all electricity . 
 Ray joins the crowd at the scene of the lightning strikes , and witnesses a massive " Tripod " war machine emerge from the ground and use alien weaponry to incinerate most of the witnesses . Ray collects his children , steals a car and drives to Mary Ann 's home in suburban New Jersey to take refuge . The next morning , he discovers that a Boeing 747 has crashed in the street . A news team scavenging for food explain that there are multiple Tripods that have attacked major cities including New York City , Washington , D.C. , and London , and have force shields to protect them from human weapons . They also explain that the lightning was how the aliens were able to enter the Tripods . Ray decides to take the kids to Boston to be with their mother . The three are forced to abandon the stolen car after a mob takes it by force . They later survive a Tripod attack which causes a Hudson River ferry to sink . During a desperate battle between the U.S. Marines and the aliens , Ray is forced to choose between being separated from Rachel and preventing Robbie from joining the fight ; he lets Robbie go with the Marines , who are overwhelmed . While escaping , Ray and Rachel are offered shelter by Harlan Ogilvy , who presumes that the aliens had buried their technology on Earth millions of years ago and has delusions that they can fight against the aliens themselves by observing their operations , as they are right next to their camp . 
 The three remain undetected for two days , even as a probe and a group of the aliens themselves explore the basement . The next morning , Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown while witnessing a Tripod harvesting human blood and tissue to fertilize an alien vegetation . Concerned that the aliens may hear Ogilvy 's madness , Ray is forced to murder him . The basement hideout is exposed when a second probe catches them sleeping . Rachel is soon abducted by a nearby Tripod and Ray allows himself to be abducted , being placed in the same cage with Rachel and other prisoners . As the aliens select him for harvesting , Ray takes a belt of grenades into the machine , having pulled out the pins . The Tripod is destroyed and releases the cage , with Ray and Rachel making it out alive . 
 Ray and Rachel arrive in a devastated Boston , where the Tripods are collapsing . Ray notices birds landing on a nearby Tripod , indicating that its shields are down . Ray alerts the soldiers escorting his refugee group and they shoot it down . As soldiers advance on the downed Tripod , a hatch opens releasing a liquid and then an alien struggles halfway out , and then decays immediately . Ray and Rachel reach Mary Ann 's parents ' house , where they are reunited with Mary Ann and , to their surprise , Robbie . The closing narration reveals that the aliens were immune to man 's machines , but were not immune to the microbes present on Earth .

 After collaborating in 2002 's Minority Report , Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise were interested in working together again . Spielberg stated about Cruise , " He 's such an intelligent , creative partner , and brings such great ideas to the set that we just spark each other . I love working with Tom Cruise . " Cruise met with Spielberg during the filming of Spielberg 's Catch Me If You Can ( 2002 ) and gave three options of films to create together , one of them being an adaptation of The War of the Worlds . Spielberg chose The War of the Worlds and stated , " We looked at each other and the lights went on . As soon as I heard it , I said ' Oh my God ! War of the Worlds – absolutely . ' That was it . " 
 The film is Spielberg 's third on the subject of alien visitation , along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra @-@ Terrestrial . Producer and longtime collaborator Kathleen Kennedy notes that with War of the Worlds , Spielberg had the opportunity to explore the antithesis of the characters brought to life in E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind . " When we first started developing E.T. , it was a much edgier , darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign . I think that the edgier , darker story has always been somewhere inside him . Now , he 's telling that story . " Spielberg stated that he just thought it would be fun to make a " really scary film with really scary aliens " , something which he had never done before . Spielberg was intent on telling a contemporary story , with Kennedy stating the story was created as a fantasy , but depicted in a hyper @-@ realistic way . 
 J. J. Abrams was asked by Spielberg and Cruise to write the script but had to turn down the film as he was working on the pilot for his television series Lost . Josh Friedman delivered a screenplay , which was then rewritten by David Koepp . After re @-@ reading the novel , Koepp decided to do the script following a single narrator , " a very limited point of view , from someone on the very periphery of events rather than someone involved in events " , and created a list of elements he would not use due to being " cliché " , such as the destruction of landmark buildings . Some aspects of the book were heavily adapted and condensed : Tim Robbins ' character was an <unk> of two characters in the book , with the name borrowed from a third . While changing the setting from 19th century to present day , Koepp also tried to " take the modern world back to the 1800s " , with the characters being devoid of electricity and modern techniques of communication . 
 Spielberg accepted the script after finding it had several similarities to his personal life , including the divorce of his parents ( Ray and Mary Ann 's divorce ) , and because the plight of the fictional survivors reflects his own uncertainty after the devastation of the September 11 attacks . For Spielberg , the characters ' stories of survival needed to be the main focus , as they featured the American mindset of never giving up . Spielberg described War of the Worlds as " a polar opposite " to Close Encounters , with that movie featuring a man leaving family to travel with aliens , while War of the Worlds focused on keeping the family together . At the same time , the aliens and their motivations would not be much explored , as " we just experience the results of these nefarious plans to replace us with themselves " . 
 Although accepting the script , Spielberg asked for several changes . Spielberg had been against the idea of the aliens arriving in spaceships , since every alien invasion movie used such a vehicle . The original Martian cylinders were discarded , where Spielberg replaced the origins of the Tripods with stating they were buried underground in the Earth long ago . 
 Lawrence Brown wrote : " Spielberg 's decision to present the invaders ' fighting machines as having been there all along , buried deep under the Earth , raises questions which did not exist in the original Wells book . In Spielberg 's version , these invaders had been here before , long ago , in prehistoric times . They had set up their machines deep underground , and departed . Why ? Why not take over the Earth right there and then ? Spielberg does not provide an answer , and the characters are too busy surviving to wonder about this . An answer suggests itself - a very chilling answer . The invaders were interested in humans as food animals . When they came here before , humans were very scarce . The aliens left their hidden machines and departed , patiently observing the Earth until humans would multiply to the requisite numbers - and then they came back , to take over . Under this interpretation , all of us - all humans over the whole of history - have been livestock living in an alien food farm , destined to be ' harvested ' " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Filming took place in Virginia , Connecticut , New Jersey , California , and New York . The film shooting lasted an estimated 72 days . Spielberg originally intended to shoot War of the Worlds after Munich , but Tom Cruise liked David Koepp 's script so much that he suggested Spielberg postpone the former while he would do the same with Mission : Impossible III . Most of Munich 's crew was brought in to work on War of the Worlds as well . In 2004 , the production crews quickly were set up on both coasts to prepare for the start date , scouting locations up and down the Eastern Seaboard and preparing stages and sets which would be used when the company returned to Los Angeles after the winter holiday . Pre @-@ production took place in only three months , essentially half the amount of time normally allotted for a film of similar size and scope . Spielberg notes , however , " This wasn 't a cram course for War of the Worlds . This was my longest schedule in about 12 years . We took our time . " Spielberg collaborated with crews at the beginning of pre @-@ production with the use of previsualization , considering the tight schedule . 
 The scene depicting the first appearance of the Tripods was filmed at the intersection of Ferry Street , <unk> Street , and Wilson Avenue , in Newark , New Jersey . Later , Spielberg filmed several scenes in Virginia . The continuous scene was filmed in California . 
 The ferry scene was filmed in the New York town of Athens , and Mary Ann 's parents house was located in Brooklyn ( but was featured in the film in Boston ) . For the neighborhood plane crash scene , the production crew bought a retired Boeing 747 , with transportation costs of $ 2 million , destroyed it into pieces , and built houses around them . The destroyed plane was kept for the Universal Studios back @-@ lot tour . Ray 's house was filmed in Bayonne , New Jersey ( with a soundstage doubling the interior ) ; meanwhile , the valley war sequence was filmed in Lexington , Virginia and Mystery Mesa in California . The scene where the tripod is shot down and crashes through a factory was filmed in Naugatuck , Connecticut . The scene of the bodies floating down the river was filmed on the Farmington River in Windsor , Connecticut by a second unit using a stand in for Dakota Fanning ( the back of her character ) with the portion showing the faces of the credited actors cut in later . Some filming was shot on the Korean War Veterans Parkway in Staten Island , NY . The film used six sound stages , spread over three studio lots . 
 = = = Design and visual effects = = = 
 Industrial Light & Magic was the main special effects company for the movie . While Spielberg had used computers to help visualize sequences in pre @-@ production before , Spielberg said , " This is the first film I really tackled using the computer to animate all the storyboards . " He decided to employ the technique extensively after a visit to his friend George Lucas . In order to keep the realism , the usage of computer @-@ generated imagery shots and bluescreen was limited , with most of the digital effects being blended with miniature and live @-@ action footage . 
 The design of the Tripods was described by Spielberg as " graceful , " with artist Doug Chiang replicating aquatic life forms . At the same time , the director wanted a design that would be iconic while still providing a tribute to the original Tripods , as well as intimidating so the audience would not be more interested about the aliens inside than on the vehicle itself . The visual effects crew tried to blend organic and mechanical elements in the Tripods depiction , and made extensive studies for the movements of the vehicle to be believable , considering the " contradiction " of having a large tank @-@ like head being carried by thin and flexible legs . Animator Randal M. <unk> considered the movements themselves to have a " terrestrial <unk> " , in that they were walking on land but had an aquatic flow , and Spielberg described the Tripods as moving like " scary ballet dancers " . Most of the alien elements revolved around the number three – the Tripod had three eyes , and both the vehicle and the aliens had three main limbs with three fingers each . Visual effects supervisor Pablo Helman considered depicting the scale of the Tripod as challenging , considering " Steven wanted to make sure that these creatures were 150 feet tall " , as it was the height described by Wells in the novel . The aliens themselves had designs based on jellyfish , with movements inspired by red @-@ eyed tree frogs , and an amphibian quality particularly on the wet skin . A styrofoam alien was used as a stand @-@ in to guide the actors in the basement scene . Spielberg did not want any blood or gore during the Heat @-@ Ray deaths ; in the words of Helman , " this was going to be a horror movie for kids " . So the effects crew came up with the vaporization of the bodies , and considering it could not be fully digital due to both the complexity of the effect and the schedule , live @-@ action dust was used alongside the CGI ray assimilation and particles . Digital birds followed the Tripods in most scenes to symbolize the presence of death , which Chiang compared to vultures and added that " you don 't know if these birds are going to the danger or away from it , if you should follow them or run away . " 
 During the scene where Ray 's minivan is attacked by a mob , Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg wanted a lot of interactive lights , so they added different kinds of lights , including Coleman lamps , oil lanterns , flashlights and <unk> . The IL & M crew admitted that the destruction of the Bayonne Bridge was the toughest scene to be made with heavy usage mix of CGI effects and live action elements , and a four @-@ week deadline so the shot could be used in a Super Bowl trailer . The scene originally had only a gas station exploding , but then Spielberg suggested blowing up the bridge as well . The scene involved Tripods shooting a Heat @-@ Ray towards the minivan and minivan escapes from it involved a lot of CGI layers to work out . Over 500 CGI effects were used in the film . 
 Costume designer Joanna Johnston created 60 different versions of Ray 's leather jacket , to illustrate the degrees to which he is weathered from the beginning of the journey to the end . " He begins with the jacket , a hoodie , and two t @-@ shirts , " explains Johnston . One piece of Dakota Fanning 's costume that takes on a special importance is her lavender horse purse : " I wanted her to have something that made her feel safe , some little thing that she could sleep with and put over her face , " Johnston notes . " That was the lavender horse purse . We tied it up on a ribbon and Dakota hung it on her body , so it was with her at all times . " Johnston dressed Robbie for an unconscious emulation of his father , " They 're more alike than they realize , with great tension on the surface , " Johnston says . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Longtime Spielberg collaborator John Williams composed the music score of War of the Worlds . It was the first time Williams had to compose with an incomplete Spielberg film , as only the first six reels , totalling sixty minutes , were ready for him to use as reference . He considered the score " a very serious piece , " which had to combine " necessary frightening atmosphere " with " propulsively rhythmic drive for the action scenes " – the music would be symbolically " pulling forward " vehicles in chase scenes such as Ray driving out of Bayonne or the Tripod attacking the Hudson ferry . Williams added small nods to classic monster movie scores by having orchestras doing a " grand gesture " in scenes overlooking Tripods . To increase the scariness , Williams added a female chorus with a crescendo resembling a shriek – which would " humanize " the track representing " victims that go out without saying an ' <unk> ' – they 're gone before they can say that " – for the Tripod attacks , and a nearly inaudible male choir – which Williams compared to " Tibetan monks , the lowest known pitch our bodies can make " – for the aliens exploring the basement . The only deviation from orchestras were electronic sounds for the opening and closing narrations . 
 A soundtrack album was released by Decca Records , that featured the film 's music and Morgan Freeman 's opening and closing narration . The songs " Little Deuce Coupe " and " <unk> Mountain " are also featured in the movie , the former sung by Tom Cruise , and the latter by Dakota Fanning . 
 = = = Themes = = = 
 The film was described as an anti @-@ war film , as civilians run and only try to save themselves and their family instead of fighting back against the alien Tripods . Debra J. Saunders of San Francisco Chronicle described the film as " If aliens invade , don 't fight back . Run . " Saunders compared the film to Independence Day , where the civilians do run , but they support the military efforts . Many reviewers considered the film tried to recreate the atmosphere of the September 11 attacks , with bystanders struggling to survive and the usage of missing @-@ persons displays . Spielberg declared to Reader 's Digest that beside the work being a fantasy , the threat represented was real : " They are a wake @-@ up call to face our fears as we confront a force intent on destroying our way of life . " Screenwriter David Koepp stated that he tried not to put explicit references to September 11 or the Iraq War , but said that the inspiration for the scene where Robbie joins the army was teenagers fighting in the Gaza Strip – " I was thinking of teenagers in Gaza throwing bottles and rocks at tanks , and I think that when you 're that age you don 't fully consider the ramifications of what you 're doing and you 're very much caught up in the moment and passion , whether that 's a good idea or not . " Retained from the novel is the aliens being defeated , not by men 's weapons , but the planet 's smallest creatures , bacteria , which Koepp described as " nature , in a way , knowing a whole lot more than we do " .

 = = = Secrecy = = = 
 Spielberg kept most of the parts secret in the filmmaking , as the cast and crew were left confused about how the aliens looked . When asked about the secrecy of the screenplay , David Koepp answered , " [ Spielberg ] wouldn 't give [ the screenplay ] to anybody " . Koepp explained he would e @-@ mail it to him , and he would give a section of the script that was relating to whatever somebody was doing . Miranda Otto thought of not even discussing the story with her family and friends . Otto said , " I know some people who always say , ' Oh , everything 's so secret . ' I think it 's good . In the old days people didn 't get to know much about movies before they came out and nowadays there 's just so much information . I think a bit of mystery is always really good . You don 't want to blow all of your cards beforehand . " 
 Spielberg admitted after keeping things secret for so long , there is in the end the temptation to reveal too much to the detriment of the story at the press conference of War of the Worlds . So , Spielberg only revealed the hill scene , where Ray tries to stop his son from leaving , stating " to say more would reveal too much . " The secrecy caused The Sun to claim the film would surpass Titanic 's US $ 200 million budget , which at the time held the record for the most expensive film ever made . The actual budget of the film was $ 132 million . 
 According to Vanity Fair , Spielberg 's relations with Cruise were " poor " during the film 's release because Spielberg believed Cruise 's " antics " at the time ( such as an erratic appearance on the Oprah Winfrey show ) had " hurt " the film .

 The film received generally positive reviews from critics . Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the film an average score of 73 based on 40 reviews . On another website , Rotten Tomatoes , War of the Worlds currently garners a 74 % " fresh " rating based on 250 reviews and the critical consensus stating [ that ] " Steven Spielberg 's adaptation of War of the Worlds delivers on the thrill and paranoia of H.G. Wells ' classic novel while impressively updating the action and effects for modern audiences . " Many people praised the film 's beginning while criticizing the ending . 
 James Berardinelli praised the acting and considered that focusing the narrative on the struggle of one character made the film more effective , but described the ending as weak , even though Spielberg " does the best he can to make it cinematically dramatic " . Total Film 's review gave War of the Worlds 4 out of 5 stars , considering that " Spielberg finds fresh juice in a tale already adapted for film , TV , stage , radio and record " , and describing the film as having many " startling images " , comparing the first Tripod attack to the Omaha Beach landing from Saving Private Ryan . 
 Los Angeles Times ' Kenneth Turan , who felt the special effects were unusual , stated that Spielberg may actually have done his job in War of the Worlds " better than he realizes " , showing how fragile the world is . Turan claimed Spielberg raised a most provocative question : " Is the ultimate fantasy an invasion from outer space , or is it the survival of the human race ? " However , Broomfield Enterprise 's Dan <unk> and Nancy <unk> did not share Berardinelli and Turan 's opinion . They felt that Morgan Freeman 's narration was unnecessary , and that the first half was " great " but the second half " became filled with clichés , riddled with holes , and tainted by Tim Robbins " . 
 Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three and a half stars ( out of four ) , saying " War of the Worlds definitely wins its battle , but not the war .

 = Neda Agha @-@ Soltan Graduate Scholarship = 
 The Neda Agha @-@ Soltan Graduate Scholarship is a scholarship for post @-@ graduate philosophy students at The Queen 's College , Oxford , with preference given to students of Iranian citizenship or heritage . It was established in 2009 following the death of Neda Agha @-@ Soltan , an Iranian philosophy student , in the street protests that followed the disputed Iranian presidential election in 2009 . The college received offers from two anonymous donors to establish a scholarship , followed by many individual donations from former students of Queen 's and others to reach its £ 70 @,@ 000 target to establish the scholarship on a permanent basis . The first recipient of the scholarship was Arianne <unk> , a philosophy student of Iranian descent , who described the award as " a great honour " . 
 The establishment of the scholarship led to criticism from the Iranian government : the Iranian embassy in London told the college that the university was involved in a " politically motivated campaign ... in sharp contrast with its academic objectives " . In response , The Times praised the scholarship in an editorial , saying that the establishment of the scholarship was indeed politically motivated , " and admirably so " , given the government 's reaction to her death and continuing problems in Iran . One British – Iranian student , Leyla <unk> , has said that the scholarship could be Agha @-@ Soltan 's " most important legacy " . The college has denied that it took a political decision in establishing the scholarship , stating that it aims to attract and support the best students , and arguing that refusal of the donations would itself have been a political act . Anonymous British diplomatic sources were reported as saying that the creation of the scholarship had put " another nail into the coffin " of relations between Britain and Iran .

 Neda Agha @-@ Soltan , a 26 @-@ year @-@ old philosophy student , was shot and killed on 20 June 2009 during street protests in Iran that followed the disputed presidential election . Video footage of her death was seen around the world . In the words of The Times , she " became an emblem of the Iranian people 's struggle for freedom , and her death a symbol of the government 's brutality " . Another writer has called her a " defining symbol of the protest movement in Iran " .

 After Agha @-@ Soltan 's death , two anonymous British donors offered to donate £ 4 @,@ 000 to establish a scholarship for post @-@ graduate students of philosophy at The Queen 's College , Oxford ( one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford ) ; the college 's governing body accepted the offers . One of the initial donors has pledged a further £ 10 @,@ 000 over five years . The college has said that the main donor was a British citizen and well known to Queen 's . By November 2009 , in the region of an additional £ 15 @,@ 000 had been donated to the scholarship fund , some from former students of the college and some from members of the public without a connection to Queen 's . A fundraising campaign targeting former philosophy students of the college led to further donations , which increased the fund to over £ 20 @,@ 000 by Michaelmas Term of 2009 . The appeal raised £ 70 @,@ 000 to put the scholarship on a permanent financial footing ; donors included people without connections to the college and some who the college said had taken " significant risks in order to donate " . 
 The decision to name the scholarship after Agha @-@ Soltan was that of the donors rather than the college : Paul Madden , the Provost of the college , said that " within reason " donors decided the name of a scholarship . The scholarship pays college fees of about £ 4 @,@ 000 over a two @-@ year period . It is open to all students at Queen 's studying for post @-@ graduate degrees in philosophy , with preference given to Iranian nationals or those with Iranian heritage . The first holder of the scholarship was Arianne <unk> , studying philosophy of physics , who is of Iranian descent . She said that it was " a great honour " to be awarded the scholarship , adding that she hoped she could " do justice " to Agha @-@ Soltan 's name . She was succeeded by an unnamed male student , studying political philosophy and the history of political thought . 
 = = Iranian government reaction = = 
 The establishment of the scholarship drew a letter of protest to the college from the Iranian embassy in London . It was written in November 2009 and signed by the deputy ambassador , <unk> <unk> . The letter disputed the circumstances of her death , and said that there was " supporting evidence indicating a pre @-@ made scenario " . <unk> wrote , " It seems that the University of Oxford has stepped up involvement in a politically motivated campaign which is not only in sharp contract with its academic objectives , but also is linked with a chain of events in post @-@ Iranian presidential elections blamed for British interference both at home and abroad " . The letter also said that the " decision to abuse Neda 's case to establish a graduate scholarship will highly politicise your academic institution , undermining your scientific credibility – along with British press which made exceptionally a lot of hue and cry on Neda 's death – will make Oxford at odd [ sic ] with the rest of the world 's academic institutions " . <unk> asked for the university 's governing board to be informed of " the Iranian views " , and finished by saying , " Surely , your steps to achieve your attractions through non @-@ politically supported programmes can better heal the wounds of her family and her nation " . 
 There was also a report of a demonstration outside the British Embassy in Tehran against the scholarship . A group of female protesters were said by the Iranian news agency Fars to have chanted " Death to Britain " . 
 In response , Madden emphasised that the scholarship was to help Iranian students without adequate financial resources of their own to study at Oxford . He said that other universities were winning the competition to attract the best graduate students , adding that donations such as these were " absolutely vital " for the college to be able to " attract and retain the best young minds " . A college spokesman said that the scholarship had not been set up as part of a political decision , and if the initial donations had been refused , this would have been interpreted as a political decision too . The university ( which did not receive a letter of complaint from the embassy ) made it clear that the decision to establish the scholarship was one for Queen 's , not for the university , since the colleges are self @-@ governing bodies . 
 = = Other reaction = = 
 Arash Hejazi , an Iranian writer who was present at Soltan 's death , praised the college for the scholarship . An unnamed Iranian academic said to The Times that the letter from the Iranian embassy showed that the death had damaged the Iranian government . A British @-@ Iranian student , Leyla <unk> , writing in The Daily Telegraph , said that the establishment of the scholarship was " more than commendable " , and " could prove to be a galvanising tool for the protestors " . She said that " Oxford 's move is as striking as it is heartening " , adding that it " honours the whole student body in Iran which has been repressed and tortured by the Islamic Republic " . She commented that " In one of Britain ’ s top universities , it will foster crucial awareness of the government 's tyrannical attitude towards education " , and said that the scholarship could be Soltan 's " most important legacy " . 
 A day after publishing the letter from the Iranian embassy , an editorial in The Times praised the college 's actions . It described Soltan 's death as a " brutal example " of a government 's suppressing opposition , and said that the Iranian response to her death was giving the country the status of " international basket case " . While the problems of Iran were no longer front @-@ page news , it said , they still existed . In the circumstances , the editorial concluded , " A scholarship at The Queen ’ s College in memory of Neda Soltan is , indeed , politically motivated , and admirably so " . 
 UK diplomatic sources , speaking anonymously to The Times , said that if the government had been asked , it would have advised against the creation of the scholarship , because Iran would see it as an act of provocation , and because it would interfere with efforts to free Iranians working for the British Embassy in Tehran who had been detained for participating in the post @-@ election protests . The sources said the scholarship had put " another nail into the coffin " of relations between Britain and Iran . 
 = Savaric FitzGeldewin = 
 Savaric fitzGeldewin ( sometimes Savaric <unk> or Savaric de Bohun ; died 8 August 1205 ) was an Englishman who became Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury in England . Related to his predecessor as well as to the German Emperor Henry VI , he was elected bishop on the urging of his predecessor , who urged his election on the cathedral chapter of Bath . While bishop , Savaric spent many years attempting to annexe Glastonbury Abbey as part of his bishopric . Savaric also worked to secure the release of King Richard I of England from captivity , when the king was held by Emperor Henry VI . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Savaric 's date of birth is unknown . His father was <unk> , who was a member of the Bohun family and was probably a second cousin of Reginald fitzJocelin , Bishop of Bath . <unk> 's father was Savaric <unk> , who held Midhurst in Sussex . The elder Savaric 's wife was Muriel , who was a granddaughter of Humphrey de Bohun . The younger Savaric 's mother <unk> was a Burgundian and related to the Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI . Savaric 's elder brother was Franco . Thus the younger Savaric was a cousin of Emperor Henry VI and also of Reginald fitzJocelin , his predecessor as Bishop of Bath . 
 Savaric first appears in the historical record in 1157 when he is named as a canon of Coutances Cathedral in Normandy . He then was archdeacon of Countances from 1162 to 1174 . He was Treasurer of Salisbury in 1174 and archdeacon of Northampton from 1175 to 1187 . The medieval chronicler Ralph Diceto says that a Savaric was appointed as Archdeacon of Canterbury , but whether this was the same Savaric is unclear . He incurred large debts to King Henry II of England , which caused the king to complain to Pope Urban III . During the years 1182 – 1184 , Savaric was deprived of his archdeaconries , which may have been connected to the debt issue with the king . 
 = = Bishop = = 
 Savaric went with Henry 's son and successor King Richard I on crusade , and it was while they both were in Sicily that Savaric obtained his bishopric . In December 1191 he was elected Bishop of Bath . Savaric 's election was held under controversial conditions , for Savaric had obtained from Richard I letters allowing Savaric to be elected to the next available bishopric . When Savaric 's cousin Reginald was elected to Canterbury in 1191 , Reginald went to Bath and pressed the clergy there to select Savaric as Reginald 's successor . On the strength of the letters from Richard , the justiciar Walter de Coutances ratified the election of Savaric . The canons of Wells objected because they had not been consulted , but Savaric was ordained a priest on 19 September 1192 at Rome . He was consecrated bishop there on 20 September 1192 by the Bishop of Albano . He went on the Third Crusade with Richard . 
 When Richard was held for ransom in Germany while returning from crusade , Savaric met with his cousin the Emperor Henry VI in an attempt to secure Richard 's release . He remained in Germany throughout 1193 and continued to be involved in the negotiations , until he returned to England at the end of the year . Once Richard was released , Savaric was one of the hostages left behind in Germany to ensure the payment of the remainder of the ransom . It may have been while he was in Germany negotiating about Richard 's ransom that he was named imperial chancellor of Burgundy , but as he was not named by that title until 1197 , the exact date of his occupation of the office is unclear . 
 = = Controversy with Glastonbury = = 
 After his consecration , Savaric traded the city of Bath to the king in return for the monastery of Glastonbury . Savaric secured the support of Pope Celestine III for the takeover the abbey as the seat of his bishopric , replacing Bath . The plan was that Savaric would be bishop of Bath as well as abbot of Glastonbury . In his support , Savaric obtained letters from various ecclesiastics , including the Archbishop of Canterbury , Hubert Walter , that claimed that this arrangement would settle longstanding disputes between the abbey and the bishops . The monks of Glastonbury objected to Savaric 's plan , and sent an appeal to Rome , which was dismissed in 1196 . But King Richard , no longer imprisoned in Germany , sided with the monks , and allowed them to elect an abbot , William Pica , in place of Savaric , who responded by excommunicating the new abbot . With the succession of John as king in place of his brother Richard in 1199 , Savaric managed to force his way into the monastery and set up his episcopal see within the abbey . The monks appealed to Innocent III , the new pope . 
 At first , Innocent took the side of the monks , and lifted Pica 's excommunication . While the newest appeal was taking place , Pica and a number of his supporters , who had traveled to Rome to appeal in person , died in Rome in 1200 , and some of the monks alleged this was by poison administered on the orders of Savaric . Meanwhile , Innocent had changed his mind , and reinstalled Savaric as abbot , ordering some English clergy to judge the specifics of the case , and allot the revenues of the abbey between Savaric and the monks . Savaric then attempted to secure more control over other monasteries in his diocese , but died before he could set the plans in motion . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Savaric died at Civitavecchia or Siena on 8 August 1205 while visiting the papacy in Rome on business for Peter des Roches , Bishop @-@ elect of Winchester . He was there to support Roches election which had been contested . Roches also supported Savaric in his struggles with Glastonbury , loaning the bishop money and being appointed to a papal commission to deal with Savaric 's petitions , which went nowhere because Savaric died before the commission first met . He was buried at Bath .

 " Teeth " was written by Lady Gaga , Taja Riley , Pete Wyoming Bender , and Teddy Riley , [ a ] and was produced by Gaga and Teddy Riley . It has been described as a " perverse march " and a " gospel ode " to sadomasochism . Bradley Stern of MuuMuse said the song is " part musical , part country , and a little bit tribal in spots " . Popjustice described " Teeth " as a " wobbly , stompy , bouncy marching song " that opens with the lyric " don 't want no money , just want your sex " and later chants , " show me your teeth ! " Lyrically , Gaga asks her lover to display his teeth for her . According to MusicOMH , " In the background another voice intones strange messages , which may or may not revolve around dentistry " . Music Times said the " skank @-@ y " horns in the track exhibit Riley 's work . In an interview with MTV , Gaga explained the meaning behind the song and its lyrics : " It is meant to mean two things , the first one kind of juvenile sexual provocative connotation is about oral sex , but also the monster in the song is fear of the truth . ' Show me your teeth ' means ' tell me the truth ' and I think that for a long time in my life that I replaced sex with the truth . " 
 In 2013 , Teddy Riley sued Gaga for US $ 500 @,@ 000 and punitive damages over the songwriting credits , and said his daughter Taja " committed fraud and copyright abuse by earning a deal with EMI for her role in the song " . Riley said he was not given the 25 percent of royalties he had been promised . He also tried to sue his daughter and said , " her participation in the creation of the composition , authorship , and ownership [ of ' Teeth ' ] are all false and untrue " .

 " Teeth " received a mixed reception from critics ; some complimented the song and others called it the album 's worst track . Gaga 's vocals was compared to those of Christina Aguilera . Slant Magazine 's Sal Cinquemani said the song " sounds like something from Michael Jackson 's last studio album as sung by Christina Aguilera ... that the closest she gets to another human being involves being tied up and bitten is revealing . " Blogcritics ' Clayton Perry said " Teeth " , along with the tracks " Monster " and " Telephone " , " thump harder than anything she 's released thus far " . In his review for Consequence of Sound , Tony Hardy describes the song as a " repetitive chant which gets its point across in the first verse , rendering the rest of it almost redundant " . Nick Levine of Digital Spy said " Teeth " is " the most sonically intriguing thing GaGa 's put her name to , an ode to rough sex conducted over an intense , tribal production that recalls Cher 's ' Half Breed ' and Fleetwood Mac 's ' Tusk ' . " 
 MusicOMH called " Teeth " the album 's " biggest curveball " and said in its review , " It doesn 't really go anywhere , the chorus getting mixed in with the verses , but it 's still a compellingly dancey listen and may be indicative of where she 's heading next " . MuuMuse 's Stern described the song as a " stomping , hoot @-@ and @-@ holler @-@ worthy chant @-@ along " that invites listeners to " cut loose and ... well , sink their teeth into the music " . He added , " It 's an odd choice to end the album , though a surefire crowd pleaser for live shows if the addictive backing beat is anything to judge by " . Popjustice rated the song six out of eight and said it " foray [ ed ] into Black Betty territory " . PopMatters ' Evan Sawdey called " Teeth " Gaga 's " most sonically adventurous song yet " .

Gaga performed an " angry version " of the song at Radio City Music Hall a few days later ; she " hunched over in an animalistic crouch , surrounded by a predatory @-@ looking pack of dancers " while images of a " ferocious " wolf were displayed . She grabbed her crotch and " snarled " to emphasize the song 's lyrics ; Dan Aquilante of the New York Post said these actions " didn ’ t seem all that inappropriate " . Gaga performed a " concert version " of the song at Lollapalooza in August 2010 , during which a guitar solo was played between each iteration of the line , " Show me your teeth ! " During some performances of the song , she told concert attendees she never lip syncs .

 The University of the Philippines Los Baños College of Forestry and Natural Resources ( also referred to as CFNR ) is one of the 11 degree @-@ granting units of the University of the Philippines Los Baños ( UPLB ) . It started as the Forest School under the UP College of Agriculture in 1910 , making it the oldest forestry school in the Philippines . It is one of the five founding units of UPLB upon its establishment in 1972 . 
 The college has been identified as a " Center of Excellence " in forestry by the Philippine Commission on Higher Education since January 2000 . CFNR offers one undergraduate degree program ( Bachelor of Science in Forestry ) along with four other graduate degree programs and one two @-@ year certificate program . Two of its professors , including its current dean , are members of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change , the 2007 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize . 
 = = History = = 
 CFNR traces its roots to the Forest School founded in April 14 , 1910 , through an Act 1989 by the Insular Government of the Philippines and efforts by Secretary of the Interior , Dean Conant Worcester . It was originally established as a department in the newly established of the College of Agriculture , and all of its early faculty were from the Bureau of Forestry . The Forest School became independent of the College of Agriculture in February 1916 through Act 2578 . Since then directors of the bureau had acted as ex officio deans of the school . The Forest School changed its name to School of Forestry in 1924 by effect of Act 3095 . 
 Arthur F. Fischer , the School of Forestry 's first dean , retired as director of the Bureau of Forestry in February 1936 . He was replaced by Florencio Tamesis who became the School of Forestry 's second dean , as well as its first Filipino dean . 
 The Second World War devastated the campus . All the School of Forestry buildings , including student and faculty houses , were destroyed . Large parts of the Makiling Forest Reserve , which is administered by the school were likewise damaged . Only four faculty including Tamesis and silviculture professor Teodoro C. <unk> , along with five students returned upon the resumption of classes . Classes were held under trees until its buildings could be reconstructed through the help of war reparation funds worth ₱ 59 @,@ 300 ( US $ 1 @,@ 380 ) . 
 The School of Forestry became the College of Forestry on June 14 , 1949 , by effect of RA 352 , with the College of Forestry finally separated from the Bureau of Forestry in 1957 , effectively putting it under direct administration of the University of the Philippines . 
 In 1954 the College of Forestry signed an agreement with Cornell University for providing academic and financial assistance . The College of Forestry received visiting professors from Cornell and grants that were used for construction and forestry research , while faculty and students were awarded scholarships for pursuing master 's degrees at US universities . 
 Domingo M. Lantican became the dean of the College of Forestry in May 1966 . Lantican implemented a 5 @-@ year campus development program which included construction of new buildings and designating areas for dormitories and staff housing . 
 The College of Forestry was reorganized to become the College of Forestry and Natural Resources on June 25 , 1998 . Since 2004 the event has been celebrated in concurrence with the Philippine Arbor Day , a nationwide event marked by extensive tree planting . 
 = = Campus = = 
 The campus of the College of Forestry and Natural Resources , referred to as the " upper campus " , is situated on the northeastern slope of Mount Makiling . The campus contains academic buildings , dormitories , hosted institutions ( such as the ASEAN Center for Biodiversity ) , and the 4 @,@ 347 @-@ hectare Makiling Forest Reserve ( MFR ) , which serves as an outdoor laboratory for forestry students and is believed to contain more tree species than the continental United States . 
 Aside from being the location of the college , the MFR is also the site of the College of Public Affairs , National Arts Center , Philippine High School for the Arts , the venue of the National Jamboree of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines ( BSP ) , the Center for Philippine Raptors and the Bureau of Plant Industry @-@ Makiling Botanic Gardens , one of the oldest parts of the campus . The gardens occupy the site where the tents were used as classrooms during the first four months of the university . 
 The MFR serves as an outdoor laboratory to students , primarily of the College of Forestry and Natural Resources . ₱ 5 million ( US $ 156 @,@ 000 ) was designated for its conservation and development in 2011 . The MFR was created in 1910 under the Bureau of Forestry . Jurisdiction over the MFR was transferred to the UP in 1960 . <unk> acquired complete jurisdiction of the MFR , however , in 1987 as part of the Philippines ' energy development program under President Corazon Aquino . The MFR was returned to UPLB three years later by effect of RA 6967 . In 2008 representative Del De Guzman of the 2nd district of Makati filed HB 1143 which , if passed into law , would have transferred jurisdiction of the MFR to the Boy Scouts of the Philippines . The bill was strongly opposed by the UPLB , citing possible mismanagement and deforestation of the site if placed under the BSP among others . 
 = = Organization and administration = = 
 The College of Forestry and Natural Resources is managed by a dean , currently Juan M. <unk> , who is appointed by the UP Board of Regents , and assisted by an associate dean . Prior to the college 's separation from the Bureau of Forestry in 1957 , the deans of the College of Forestry and its predecessors were not appointed by the board but were the directors of the Bureau of Forestry acting as ex officio heads of the college . Due to the distance of the Bureau of Forestry in Manila from the Forest School in Los Baños ( about 64 kilometers ) , directors of the bureau appointed foresters @-@ in @-@ charge to manage the school , a practice which continued until 1957 . 
 The College of Forestry and Natural Resources is a founding member of the Asia Pacific of Forestry Research Institutions , and the CFNR Institute of Agroforestry is a member of the Philippine Agroforestry Education and Research Network . 
 = = Academics = = 
 CFNR offers one undergraduate degree program ( Bachelor of Science in Forestry ) , four graduate degree programs and one certificate program . It started offering master 's and doctor 's degrees in 1966 and 1973 , respectively . The college produces about 100 graduates every year and has been identified as a " Center of Excellence " in forestry by the Philippine Commission on Higher Education since January 2000 . 
 Admission to the BS Forestry program is done through the University of the Philippines College Admission Test , while a Certificate in Forestry applicants are screened by a test administered by CFNR . Admission to graduate programs are managed by the Graduate School . Of its 394 students in 2008 , 61 and 295 were enrolled in its Certificate in Forestry and BS Forestry programs , respectively , while the rest are in its graduate degree programs . As of 2009 it had 393 students enrolled in all of its programs . 38 of its faculty hold PhDs . 
 While all of its 20 students when the Forest School opened were male , more than 60 % of the students of the college were female as of 2003 . Women first enrolled in the college in 1951 . Other forestry schools in the Philippines have also experienced a similar increase in female enrollment . 
 The graduates of the college has maintained substantially good performance in the forestry license exams conducted by the Professional Regulation Commission . For instance , the mean passing rates of its graduates in the exams for the years 2008 – 2010 is 92 @.@ 49 % . This is almost double of the mean national passing rate for the same period . Furthermore , six of its graduates belonged to the top ten best performing students in the 2010 exam , while four belonged to the top ten in both 2008 and 2009 exams . ( see table )

 In 2002 the college had 94 researchers working in its eight research units . This includes the Makiling Center for Mountain Ecosystems , believed to be the first institution in the Philippines devoted to the study of mountain ecology . It also manages the Makiling Forest Reserve and has launched programs promoting its conservation . 
 The Forest Products Research and Development Institute , founded as the Forest Products Laboratory under the Bureau of Forestry in 1954 , is hosted in the campus . Managed by the Department of Science and Technology of the government of the Philippines , it is engaged in paper science and bioenergy research , among others . It has also generated technologies such as those for biomass energy generation and construction . Its facilities , believed to be the " largest and best equipped in the eastern hemisphere " by the time of its construction , were patterned after the University of Wisconsin 's Forest Products Laboratory . It was built using US grants worth US $ 239 @,@ 552 and funding from the Philippine government worth ₱ 518 @,@ 000 ( US $ 12 @,@ 000 ) . It had a total budget of almost ₱ 87 million ( US $ 2 @.@ 01 million ) in 2011 , with about ₱ 51 million ( US $ 1 @.@ 18 million ) of this appropriated for research .

 = Nebula Science Fiction = 
 Nebula Science Fiction was the first Scottish science fiction magazine . It was published from 1952 to 1959 , and was edited by Peter Hamilton , a young Scot who was able to take advantage of spare capacity at his parents ' printing company , Crownpoint , to launch the magazine . Because Hamilton could only print Nebula when Crownpoint had no other work , the schedule was initially erratic . In 1955 he moved the printing to a Dublin @-@ based firm , and the schedule became a little more regular , with a steady monthly run beginning in 1958 that lasted into the following year . Nebula 's circulation was international , with only a quarter of the sales in the United Kingdom ( UK ) ; this led to disaster when South Africa and Australia imposed import controls on foreign periodicals at the end of the 1950s . Excise duties imposed in the UK added to Hamilton 's financial burdens , and he was rapidly forced to close the magazine . The last issue was dated June 1959 . 
 The magazine was popular with writers , partly because Hamilton went to great lengths to encourage new writers , and partly because he paid better rates per word than much of his competition . Initially he could not compete with the American market , but he offered a bonus for the most popular story in the issue , and was eventually able to match the leading American magazines . He published the first stories of several well @-@ known writers , including Robert Silverberg , Brian Aldiss , and Bob Shaw . Nebula was also a fan favourite : author Ken Bulmer recalled that it became " what many fans regard as the best @-@ loved British SF magazine " .

 In 1952 Peter Hamilton was 18 years old and had just left school ; he was looking for a job , but was not healthy enough for hard physical work . His parents ran a printing house in Glasgow , Crownpoint Publications , and occasionally had spare capacity : they were interested in using the idle time on their machinery to enter the publishing business , and Peter persuaded them to publish paperback science fiction ( sf ) novels . Two novels were acquired , but when Crownpoint approached a local wholesaler to handle the distribution , they were told that paperbacks would be a mistake , and that a magazine , with a regular publication schedule , would be more likely to sell well . The result was Nebula Science Fiction . The first issue was dated Autumn 1952 , and sold 4 @,@ 000 copies . 
 Advertisements stated that Nebula was " Scotland 's first S.F. magazine ! ! " Several British science fiction fans helped Hamilton with the production of the magazine , including Ken Slater , Vin ¢ Clarke , and John Brunner . William F. Temple was involved as an editorial consultant and also assisted with editing the manuscripts . Hamilton provided all the financing , but he had to wait for the money to come in from each issue before he could afford to produce the next . In addition , Crownpoint only intermittently had enough spare capacity to print Nebula , so the first few issues appeared on an erratic schedule . After a dozen issues , the conflicts led to Hamilton moving Nebula to a printing firm based in Dublin , and breaking the connection with Crownpoint . He was then able to publish on a slightly more regular schedule , although the planned bi @-@ monthly issues were still sometimes delayed . Hamilton paid 21 shillings ( £ 1 @.@ 05 ) per thousand words , the equivalent of three tenths of a cent per word ; this was a low rate compared to the American market , but was marginally better than the contemporary British magazine Authentic Science Fiction , which paid £ 1 per thousand words . Hamilton offered a bonus of £ 2 or £ 5 to the story that turned out to be the readers ' favourite in each issue , which helped attract writers ; and he later increased the rates , paying as much as 2d ( <unk> , or 2 @.@ 3 cents ) per word for well @-@ known authors . This was higher than the best UK markets , such as New Worlds , and was close to the rates paid by the top magazines in the US at that time . Both the high rates of pay and Hamilton 's willingness to work with new authors were designed to encourage writers to submit their work to Nebula before trying the other magazines . 
 Hamilton 's editorial in the September 1957 issue reported a circulation of 40 @,@ 000 , and starting in January 1958 Nebula went on a regular monthly schedule that was maintained until early 1959 . Although Nebula 's circulation was strong , only about a quarter of its sales were in the UK . A further quarter of the sales were in Australia , another third in the US , and nearly a tenth in South Africa . At the end of the 1950s , first South Africa and then Australia began to limit foreign magazine imports , for economic reasons , and when this was followed by UK excise duties the magazine was quickly in debt . Hamilton was forced to cease publication with issue 41 , dated June 1959 . Hamilton had also had health problems which contributed to his decision to stop publication . 
 = = Contents and reception = = 
 The first two issues of Nebula contained the two novels Hamilton had bought before changing his plans from a paperback series to a magazine : Robots Never Weep by E.R. James , and Thou Pasture Us , by F.G. Rayer . These left little room for other material , but Hamilton was able to reprint a short story by A. E. van Vogt in the first issue , and stories by John Brunner and E. C. Tubb in the second issue , along with material by lesser known writers . There was also a column by Walt Willis called " The Electric Fan " , later renamed " <unk> " , which covered science fiction fandom . 
 Many of the better @-@ known British writers began to appear in Nebula , including William F. Temple and Eric Frank Russell ; new authors also began to be published . Hamilton was glad to work with beginning writers , and in 1953 several writers who later became very well known , including Brian Aldiss , Barrington Bayley , and Bob Shaw , each sold their first story to Nebula . Not all these stories reached print that year : Aldiss ’ s " T " appeared in the November 1956 issue , by which time other stories of Aldiss ’ s were in print , and the first story by Bayley is not certainly identified – it may have been " Consolidation " , which appeared in November 1959 , but it is also possible that it was never printed . Robert Silverberg had begun submitting stories to Hamilton as soon as he heard of Nebula , realizing that Hamilton was unlikely to be getting many submissions from US writers , and found Hamilton very helpful . Silverberg 's first story , " Gorgon Planet " , was accepted by Hamilton on January 11 , 1954 . Brian Aldiss echoes Silverberg 's assessment of Hamilton , commenting that Hamilton was " a sympathetic editor to a beginner . He was also a patient editor . " 
 Other authors who appeared in Nebula early in their careers included Harlan Ellison , John Rackham , and James White . Science fiction historian Mike Ashley regards the stories Hamilton selected as demonstrating a " wide range of material by excellent writers " that was " seldom predictable " , but adds that the stories have become dated , with the result that few are now well @-@ known . Among a short list of exceptions Ashley includes Brian Aldiss ’ s " Legends of Smith ’ s Burst " and " Dumb Show " . Because of the erratic schedule , Hamilton only serialised one novel : Wisdom of the Gods , by Ken Bulmer , which appeared in four parts , starting in the July 1958 issue . Hamilton was planning to serialise a novel by Robert Heinlein when the magazine ceased publication . 
 Cover art came from artists such as Gerard Quinn , and included some of Eddie Jones ' earliest work . According to sf historian Philip Harbottle , the best of the Scottish artists that Hamilton worked with was James Stark , who painted nine covers for Nebula between 1956 and 1958 ; sf artist and art historian David Hardy describes Stark 's work as " severe portrayals of technology against which men were mere ants " . Interior artists included Harry Turner , whose work is described by Harbottle as " visually striking " and " semi @-@ impressionistic " . From the October 1954 issue the back cover was given over to black and white artwork , often drawn by Arthur Thomson . Author Ken Bulmer regards these back covers as having given the magazine a " tremendously individual flavor " . 
 Nebula became an established part of the British science fiction scene in the 1950s . The magazine was well @-@ liked by writers , and Bulmer recalls that , overall , Nebula " created a special kind of charisma that , in the view of many writers and readers , no other magazine ever had " , and adds that it became " what many fans regard as the best @-@ loved British SF magazine " . Tubb , who sold many popular stories to Hamilton , comments that " Authors wrote for Nebula with financial reward taking secondary place ; the desire of submitting a good story being of primary importance ... the writers and the contributors felt as if Nebula was ' their ' magazine , and all that became a happy , well @-@ integrated family . " 
 = = Bibliographic details = = 
 The publisher was Crownpoint Publications for the first twelve issues , though the name was dropped from the indicia starting with the December 1953 issue . From September 1955 the publisher was Peter Hamilton , who was editor throughout . The price was 2 / - ( 10p ) for all but the last two issues , which were priced at 2 / 6 ( <unk> ) . 
 Nebula was printed in large digest format , 8 @.@ 5 by 5 @.@ 5 inches ( 220 mm × 140 mm ) . The first three issues were 120 pages ; this increased to 128 pages for the next three issues , to 130 pages for issue 7 , and to 136 pages for issue 8 . Issues 9 through 12 were 128 pages , and the remaining issues were 112 pages . The issues were numbered consecutively throughout ; the first eight issues were given volume numberings as well , with two volumes of four numbers each . 
 Issues 30 through 39 of Nebula were distributed in the US ; they were stamped at 35 cents and post @-@ dated four months , thus the American copies ran from September 1958 to June 1959 . 
 = Malmö FF = 
 Malmö <unk> , also known simply as Malmö FF , Malmö , or ( especially locally ) MFF , is a Swedish professional football club based in Malmö . The club is the most successful in Sweden in terms of trophies won , and the only Nordic club to have reached the European Cup final . Formed on 24 February 1910 , Malmö FF is affiliated with <unk> <unk> and the team play their home games at the Swedbank Stadion . The club colours , reflected in their crest and kit , are sky blue and white . 
 The club have won the most league titles of any Swedish club with twenty @-@ one , a joint record eighteen Swedish championship titles and a record fourteen national cup titles . They were runners @-@ up in the 1979 European Champions Cup final , which they lost 1 – 0 to English club Nottingham Forest . This made them the only Swedish football club , as of 2016 , to have reached the final of the competition , for which the team were awarded the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal . In more recent history the team qualified for two consecutive group stages of the Champions League in 2014 and 2015 . 
 Malmö FF is an open member association and the annual general meeting is the highest policy @-@ making body . The meeting approves the accounts and elects the chairman and board . Håkan Jeppsson is the current chairman , elected in 2010 . Daily operations are run by a managing director who <unk> with the chairman . With an equity of 450 million SEK ( approximately € 39 @.@ 13 million ) the club is the richest football club in Sweden as of 2016 . 
 The club is currently playing in Allsvenskan , where the season lasts from April to November . Malmö FF are the leaders of the overall Allsvenskan table <unk> as of the end of the 2015 season . The club first won Allsvenskan in 1944 . Malmö FF were most successful during the 1970s , when they won five Swedish championships and four Svenska Cupen titles . The main rivals of the club are Helsingborgs IF , IFK Göteborg and historically IFK Malmö . MFF Support is the official fan club of Malmö FF . The club have also been featured in media , including the football documentaries Blådårar 1 and Blådårar 2 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 The club arose from a municipal initiative in 1905 to encourage young people in Malmö to play organised football . One of the youth teams , <unk> Idrott , also known simply as BK Idrott , was a predecessor to Malmö FF . BK Idrott joined the newly created football department of IFK Malmö in 1909 , but soon left because of issues between the two clubs . On 24 February 1910 the 19 members of BK Idrott founded Malmö FF ; the first chairman was Werner <unk> . 
 The club spent their first ten years in local and regional divisions as there was no official national league competition , playing the majority of their matches in the city division called <unk> . They also competed in regional competitions in Scania , and played matches against Danish clubs . In 1916 Malmö FF reached the final of the Scanian regional competition ( <unk> ) for the first time , playing against rival Helsingborgs IF but losing 3 – 4 . The club defeated local rival IFK Malmö three times during the season , and thus earned the unofficial but much desired title of Malmö 's best football club . In 1917 Malmö FF competed in Svenska <unk> for the first time , a cup tournament for the title of Swedish champions , but lost their first match in the second qualifying round 4 – 1 against IFK Malmö . The club continued to play in the cup until 1922 , reaching the quarter @-@ finals in 1920 when they were knocked out by Landskrona <unk> . The cup was eventually discontinued and the title of Swedish champions was given to the winners of Allsvenskan which was first created for the 1924 – 25 season . 
 In 1920 the Swedish Football Association invited Swedish football clubs to compete in official national competitions . Malmö FF earned a place in Division 2 Sydsvenska Serien . They won this division in the first season , and were promoted to Svenska Serien Västra , the highest level of competition in Sweden at the time . However , they were relegated after a single season , and found themselves back in Sydsvenska Serien for nearly a decade until they again achieved promotion to Allsvenskan , in 1931 . 
 = = = First years in Allsvenskan and early achievements = = = 
 The club achieved mid @-@ table league positions for two seasons , but they were relegated in 1934 as a penalty for breaking amateur regulations . The club had paid their players a small sum of money for each game . Although against the rules , this was common at the time ; Malmö FF were the only club to show it in their accounting records . In addition to relegation to Division 2 , the club suffered bans for the entire board of directors and twenty @-@ six players . The version of events told by Malmö FF and local press suggests that local rival IFK Malmö reported the violation to the Swedish Football Association . This belief has contributed to the longstanding competitive tensions between the clubs . 
 The club made their way back to Allsvenskan in 1937 after two seasons in Division 2 . In the same year Eric Persson was elected as chairman after being secretary since 1929 , and held the position until 1974 . Persson is regarded by club leaders and fans as the most important person in the club 's history , as he turned the club professional in the 1970s . Under his leadership the club went from being <unk> in 1937 to holding ten Swedish championships by the end of the 1974 season . In 1939 the club reached their highest position yet , third place in Allsvenskan , nine points behind champions IF Elfsborg . Malmö FF 's first Swedish championship came in 1944 , when the club won the penultimate game of the season against AIK before 36 @,@ 000 spectators at Råsunda . The last game of the season was won 7 – 0 against Halmstad BK . 
 For the next nine seasons , Malmö FF finished in the top three in the league . The club won the Swedish Championship in 1949 , 1950 , 1951 and 1953 , and were runners @-@ up in 1946 , 1948 and 1952 . The club also won Svenska Cupen in 1944 , 1946 , 1947 , 1951 and 1953 , and finished as runners @-@ up in 1945 . Between 6 May 1949 and 1 June 1951 , the team were unbeaten in 49 matches , of which 23 were an unbroken streak of victories . 
 The club finished as runners @-@ up in Allsvenskan twice more , in 1956 and 1957 . The following year the club left Malmö IP for Malmö Stadion , which had been built for the 1958 FIFA World Cup , and was to host the club for the next 50 years . In 1964 Malmö FF contracted Spanish manager Antonio Durán ; this was the first of a series of changes that led to the most successful era in the club 's history . Young talents such as Lars <unk> and Bo Larsson emerged during the early 1960s and would prove to be crucial ingredients in the success that would come in the 1970s . The club finished second in 1964 but went on to win their sixth Swedish Championship in 1965 , when Bo Larsson scored 28 goals to finish as the league 's top goal scorer . Malmö FF once again won Allsvenskan in 1967 , after a less successful year in 1966 . The club 's young players , as well as talents bought in from neighbouring clubs in Scania in 1967 , became a team that consistently finished in the top three in Allsvenskan . 
 = = = Successful 1970s , European Cup 1979 , 1980s and 1990s = = = 
 After finishing as runners @-@ up in Allsvenskan for the final two years of the 1960s , Malmö FF started the most successful decade of their history with a Swedish Championship in 1970 . The club won Allsvenskan in 1970 , 1971 , 1974 , 1975 and 1977 as well as Svenska Cupen in 1976 and 1978 . The 1977 Allsvenskan victory qualified the club for the 1978 – 79 European Cup , and after victories against AS Monaco , Dynamo Kyiv , Wisła Kraków and Austria Wien , they reached the final of the competition , which they played at Olympiastadion in Munich against Nottingham Forest . Trevor Francis , who scored the only goal of the match , won it 1 – 0 for Forest . Nevertheless , the 1979 European Cup run is the biggest success in the history of Malmö FF . The team were given the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal the same year , awarded for the most significant Swedish sporting achievement of the year , for their achievement in the European Cup . 
 Much of the success during the 1970s was due to new tactics and training methods brought to the club by Englishman Bob Houghton , who managed the club between 1974 and 1980 . Eric Persson was succeeded as chairman in 1974 by Hans Cavalli @-@ Björkman . After the team performed respectably under managers Keith Blunt and <unk> Grip in the early 1980s , Roy Hodgson took over in 1985 . He led the club to two Swedish Championships in 1986 and 1988 , and the club won Allsvenskan five years in a row between 1985 and 1989 . At the time , the championship was decided by play @-@ offs between the best teams after the end of the regular season ; this arrangement was in place from 1982 until 1992 . The club reached the play @-@ off final four times between 1986 and 1989 but only managed to win the final twice . Apart from Allsvenskan and Swedish Championships , the club won Svenska Cupen in 1984 , 1986 and 1989 . 
 Other than finishing as runners @-@ up in Allsvenskan in 1996 , the team did not excel in the 1990s , as the club failed to win Allsvenskan and Svenska Cupen throughout the entire decade . The 1990s ended with relegation from Allsvenskan in 1999 . Hans Cavalli @-@ Björkman was succeeded as chairman by Bengt Madsen in 1999 , and former player Hasse Borg was contracted as Director of Sport . These operational changes , as well as the emergence of young talent Zlatan Ibrahimović , led to the return to Allsvenskan in 2001 . Ibrahimović rose to fame and became an important player in the club 's campaign to return to the top league . He was later sold to Ajax in 2001 , before playing for several European clubs in Italy 's Serie A , FC Barcelona in Spain 's La Liga and his current club as of 2015 , Paris Saint @-@ Germain in France 's Ligue 1 . 
 = = = Start of the 2000s to the present = = = 
 The return to Allsvenskan was the start of the successful early 2000s , under the management of Tom <unk> , when the club finished in the top three three times in a row . In 2004 , it won Allsvenskan , the club 's fifteenth Swedish Championship . In 2005 , the club reached the last qualifying round for the UEFA Champions League but were defeated by FC Thun . Successful sponsor work and player sales also made Malmö FF the richest club in Sweden , a position they still hold as of 2013 . The club moved from Malmö Stadion to Swedbank Stadion in 2009 , a stadium built entirely for football and located next to the old one . 
 In 2009 , Madsen announced that he would step down as chairman , and was replaced by Håkan Jeppsson early the following year . In 2010 , the club marked their 100th anniversary with many celebratory events at the beginning of the season . On the day of the club 's 100th anniversary in 2010 , the Swedish football magazine Offside declared Malmö FF to be the greatest football club in Swedish history . The season became a great success as the club won Allsvenskan for the nineteenth time and became Swedish champions for the sixteenth time . Unlike in 2004 , these successes were achieved without any major transfers before the season , and with a squad consisting mostly of younger players . 
 In October 2013 , Malmö FF won their seventeenth Swedish championship and 20th Allsvenskan title in the penultimate round of the league away from home . Similar to 2010 , the title was the result of a young squad . The average age of the squad , 23 @.@ 8 years , was the youngest team to become champions since the beginning of the 21st century . The following year Malmö FF qualified for the group stage of the 2014 – 15 UEFA Champions League by beating Ventspils , Sparta Prague and Red Bull Salzburg in the qualifying rounds . This was the first time the club qualified for the competition proper since the re @-@ branding from the European Cup in the 1992 – 93 season and the first time since the 2000 – 01 season that a Swedish club qualified . In the following months Malmö FF defended their league title , winning their eighteenth Swedish championship and 21st Allsvenskan title . This was the first time a club defended the Allsvenskan title since the 2003 season . The 2015 season saw Malmö FF failing to retaining the title and missing out on the top @-@ four for the first time since 2009 . However , the club managed to qualify once again to the group stages of the UEFA Champions League in the 2015 – 16 UEFA Champions League edition . 
 The club remains one of the dominant football clubs in Sweden . As of the end of the 2015 Allsvenskan season , the club are the leaders of the overall Allsvenskan table <unk> . Malmö FF are also the record holders for total number of Allsvenskan championships and Svenska Cupen championships , and share the record of most Swedish championships with IFK Göteborg . 
 = = Colours and crest = = 
 The club is often known by the nicknames Di <unk> ( The Blues ) and <unk> ( The Sky Blues ) . This is because of the club colours , sky blue and white . The players wear sky @-@ blue shirts , white shorts , and sky @-@ blue socks . The away colours are red and white striped shirts , black shorts , and red socks . Various alternative kits have been used for European play such as all @-@ white kits introduced in the 1950s , a kit which was re @-@ used for the 2011 and 2012 seasons , and all @-@ black kits with sky @-@ blue and golden edges and text used for European play in 2005 as well as in 2013 . 
 = = = Kit evolution = = = 
 The club colours have not always been sky blue . The predecessor club BK Idrott wore blue and white striped shirts and white shorts , and this kit was still used for the first six months of 1910 after Malmö FF was founded . This was later changed to red and white striped shirts and black shorts to symbolise that Malmö FF were a new club , and a very similar kit has been used in modern times as the away kit for historical reasons . The present sky @-@ blue kit was introduced in 1920 . Since 2010 a small Scanian flag is featured on the back of the shirt just below the neck . 
 = = = Crest evolution = = = 
 The crest of Malmö FF consists of a shield with two vertical sky @-@ blue fields on the sides , and one vertical white field in the middle . Underneath the shield is " Malmö FF " spelled out in sky @-@ blue letters with a sky @-@ blue star under the text . In the top area of the shield is a white horizontal field over the three vertical fields . The abbreviation of the club name " MFF " is spelled out with sky @-@ blue letters in this field . On top of the shield are five tower @-@ like extensions of the white field . The present shield crest made its debut on the shirt in the 1940s . There were other crests before this but they were never featured on the shirt . While the first crest was black and white , the second crest was red and white in accordance with the club 's main colours between 1910 and 1920 . 
 In modern times two golden stars has been added over the shield . This is a feature used only on the crests on player shirts . The stars are used to symbolize that the club have won more than twenty domestic titles . In the original shield logo the full club name and sky @-@ blue star beneath the shield were not featured , they were later added when club chairman Eric Persson discovered while abroad that people had trouble identifying what city the club came from just by looking at the club crest . For the 100th anniversary of the club in 2010 , the years 1910 and 2010 were featured on each side of the shield on a sky @-@ blue ribbon behind the shield . 
 = = = Kit manufacturer and shirt sponsors = = = 
 The current kit manufacturers are Puma , they also sponsor the club and many of Puma 's products are sold in the official Malmö FF souvenir shop at Swedbank Stadion . Puma has supplied kits for the club since at least 1976 , and has been the kit manufacturer for the majority of the 1990s , 2000s and 2010s . Other partners include <unk> ( late 1970s ) , Admiral ( late 1970s ) , Adidas ( early 1980s ) and Nike ( 1998 – 2001 ) . 
 The first sponsor to appear on Malmö FF 's jerseys was local shipyard company <unk> in 1976 , and since 1981 at least one sponsor logo has appeared on the club 's kits . In the mid @-@ 1990s it became commonplace for Swedish clubs to have several shirt sponsors . Malmö FF was no exception , and this was the case until 2010 when the club returned to working with only one partner . 
 = = Supporters and rivalries = = 
 Malmö FF are well known for their large local following . The club has several fan clubs , of which the largest is the official fan club MFF Support . It was founded in 1992 . MFF Support describes itself as " a non @-@ profit and non @-@ political organization working against violence and racism " . The current chairman of MFF Support is Magnus Ericsson . 
 There are also several smaller independent supporter groups . The most prominent of these is Supras Malmö , which was founded in 2003 by a coalition of smaller ultras groups and devoted fans . The name " Supras " is derived from the words supporters and ultras – the latter indicating that the group is inspired by a fan culture with roots in the Mediterranean . Supras Malmö is the most visible group in the main supporter stand at Swedbank Stadion , marking its presence with banners , flags and choreography . Another group with similar goals is Rex Scania . MFF <unk> 96 ( <unk> ) is a network of supporters creating <unk> for special occasions and important games . The average attendance for the club 's games in the 2015 season was 17 @,@ 332 , the third best attendance in 2015 Allsvenskan after Hammarby and AIK . 
 Because of geographical proximity , minor rivalries exist with Trelleborgs FF and Landskrona <unk> , which are both also located in Scania . The main rivals of the club are Helsingborgs IF , IFK Göteborg and IFK Malmö . The rivalry between Malmö FF and Helsingborgs IF has existed since Malmö FF were promoted up to Allsvenskan in the 1930s , and is primarily geographic , since both teams are from Scania in southern Sweden . The rivalry with IFK Göteborg relates more to title clashes ; the two are the most successful clubs in Swedish football history and the only two to have appeared in European cup finals , IFK Göteborg in the UEFA Cup in 1982 and 1987 and Malmö FF in the European Cup in 1979 . 
 The rivalry with IFK Malmö is both geographical and historical . The two clubs come from the same city and used to play at the same stadium in the early 20th century . The supposed actions of board members of IFK Malmö in 1933 , revealing Malmö FF 's breaches of amateur football rules to the Swedish Football Association , further contribute to the competitive tensions between the two clubs . IFK Malmö have not played in Allsvenskan since 1962 ; thus matches between the two sides are rare . 
 = = Stadiums = = 
 Malmö FF 's first stadium was Malmö IP , which was shared with arch @-@ rivals IFK Malmö . The team played here from the founding of the club in 1910 , until 1958 . The stadium still exists today , albeit with lower capacity , and is now used by women 's team FC Rosengård , who were previously the women 's section of Malmö FF . Capacity in 2012 is 7 @,@ 600 , but attendances were usually much higher when Malmö FF played there . For the last season in 1957 , the average attendance was 15 @,@ 500 . The club 's record attendance at Malmö IP is 22 @,@ 436 against Helsingborgs IF on 1 June 1956 . The stadium is still considered a key part of the club 's history , as it was here that the club were founded , played their first 47 seasons , and won five Swedish championships . 
 A new stadium was constructed in Malmö after Sweden was awarded the 1958 FIFA World Cup – this saw the birth of Malmö Stadion . Malmö FF played their first season at the stadium in 1958 . The first time the club won the Swedish championship at the stadium was in 1965 . An upper tier was added to the stadium in 1992 . The club enjoyed the most successful era of their history at this stadium , winning ten out of eighteen Swedish championships while based there . The stadium originally had a capacity of 30 @,@ 000 but this was lowered to 27 @,@ 500 due to changes in safety regulations . The club 's record attendance at the stadium was 29 @,@ 328 against Helsingborgs IF on 24 September 1967 . 
 Following the 2004 victory in Allsvenskan , plans were made to construct a new stadium . In July 2005 , Malmö FF announced that work was to begin on Swedbank Stadion , designed for 18 @,@ 000 seated spectators and 6 @,@ 000 standing . The stadium can also accommodate 21 @,@ 000 as an all @-@ seater for international and European games in which terracing is not allowed . Construction started in 2007 and was finished in 2009 . The new stadium is located next to Malmö Stadion . Although there was still small @-@ scale construction going on around the stadium at the time , the stadium was inaugurated on 13 April 2009 with the first home game of the 2009 season against Örgryte IS ; Malmö FF 's Labinot <unk> scored the inaugural goal in the 61st minute . The first Swedish championship won at the stadium occurred in 2010 , when the club beat Mjällby AIF on 7 November in the final game of the season 2 – 0 . Attendance at this game set the stadium record of 24 @,@ 148 . Swedbank Stadion is a UEFA category 4 rated stadium .

 = United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia = 
 The United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia , commonly abbreviated UNCRO , was a United Nations ( UN ) peacekeeping mission in Croatia . It was established under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and approved by the UN Security Council ( UNSC ) Resolution 981 on 31 March 1995 . UNCRO inherited personnel and infrastructure from the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) . Its command was located in Zagreb ; the peacekeeping troops were deployed in four sectors named North , South , East , and West . Twenty different countries contributed troops to the mission . 
 UNCRO started with more than 15 @,@ 000 troops taken over from UNPROFOR ; the personnel count was gradually reduced to approximately 7 @,@ 000 by the end of the mission in early 1996 . South Korean diplomat Byung Suk Min was the civilian head of the mission , while the military commanders of UNCRO were Generals Raymond Crabbe and Eid Kamal Al @-@ Rodan . UNCRO was linked with UNPROFOR , which remained active in Bosnia and Herzegovina , and with the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force ( <unk> ) , which was deployed in the Republic of Macedonia . The mission was terminated on 15 January 1996 by UNSC Resolution 1025 , passed on 30 November 1995 . Sixteen UNCRO troops were killed , including four during Operation Storm in August 1995 . 
 UNCRO was tasked with upholding the March 1994 ceasefire in the Croatian War of Independence , supporting an agreement on economic cooperation between Croatia and the self @-@ declared Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) , monitoring areas between opposing armies , monitoring the demilitarised Prevlaka peninsula , undertaking liaison functions , delivering humanitarian aid , and occupying 25 checkpoints along Croatia 's international borders between RSK @-@ held territory , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , and Bosnia and Herzegovina . UNCRO , like the UNPROFOR mission before it , was criticised for lacking sufficient troops and adequate resources to carry out the mission , and fulfilment of the mission 's mandate proved nearly impossible . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1990 , following the electoral defeat of the Communist regime in Croatia , ethnic tensions worsened . After the elections , the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska narodna armija , or JNA ) confiscated the weapons of Croatia 's Territorial Defence Force ( Teritorijalna obrana , or TO ) to minimise any resistance . On 17 August 1990 , the tensions escalated to an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs , centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin , and parts of the Lika , Kordun , Banovina and eastern Croatia regions . The Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) , later established in those areas , declared its intention to integrate with Serbia , and was viewed by the Government of Croatia as a breakaway region . The JNA prevented Croatian police from intervening . By March 1991 , the conflict had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence . In June , Croatia declared independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated , but implementation of the decision was postponed until 8 October by a three @-@ month moratorium . A campaign of ethnic cleansing then began in the RSK ; most non @-@ Serbs were expelled by early 1993 . 
 As the JNA increasingly supported the RSK , the Croatian police could not cope with the situation . In May 1991 , the Croatian National Guard ( Zbor narodne garde , or ZNG ) was formed as the military of Croatia and was renamed the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska , or HV ) in November . Late 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war , culminating in the Battle of the Barracks , the Siege of Dubrovnik , and the Battle of Vukovar . In January 1992 , a ceasefire agreement to implement the Vance plan was signed by representatives of Croatia , the JNA , and the UN , and fighting paused . The Vance plan was designed to stop hostilities in Croatia and allow negotiations by neutralizing any influence caused by fighting , but offered no political solutions in advance . The plan entailed deployment of the 10 @,@ 000 @-@ person United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) to the major conflict areas known as " UN Protected Areas " ( UNPAs ) . UNPROFOR was tasked with creating a buffer between the belligerents , disarming Croatian Serb elements of the TO , overseeing JNA and HV withdrawal from the UNPAs , and return of refugees to the area . United Nations Security Council Resolution 743 of 21 February 1992 described the legal basis of the UN mission that had been requested and agreed upon in November 1991 , and made no explicit reference to Chapter VI or Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter . Only a reference to Chapter VII would have permitted the peacekeeping force to enforce its mandate regardless of the level of cooperation of the belligerents . 
 Because of organisational problems and breaches of the ceasefire agreement , UNPROFOR did not start to deploy until 8 March and took two months to fully deploy in the UNPAs . Even though UNPROFOR had placed most heavy weapons of the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina ( ARSK ) in storage controlled jointly by the UN and the RSK by January 1993 , the force was unable to fulfil all of the provisions of the Vance plan , including disarmament of the ARSK , the return of refugees , restoration of civilian authority , and the establishment of an ethnically integrated police . It also failed to remove ARSK forces from areas outside the designated UNPAs which were under ARSK control at the time the ceasefire had been signed . Those areas , later known as the " pink zones " , were supposed to be restored to Croatian control from the outset . Failure to implement this aspect of the Vance plan made the pink zones a major source of contention between Croatia and the RSK . In 1993 , worried that the situation on the ground might become permanent , Croatia launched several small @-@ scale military offensives against the RSK to seize significant local objectives and attract international attention . In response , the ARSK retrieved their weapons from the UN / RSK @-@ controlled storage sites , reversing the only major success of UNPROFOR in Croatia . 
 = = Transition from UNPROFOR to UNCRO = = 
 The UNPROFOR mandate was extended several times , in increments of up to six months , with consent of the government of Croatia . That changed in early 1995 , when Croatian President Franjo Tuđman wrote to the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations informing him that Croatia would not accept further extensions of the mission once it expired on 31 March and asking that UNPROFOR leave Croatia by the end of June . At the time , it was established UN practice to seek consent of the country where its peacekeepers were deployed , and the letter effectively required UNPROFOR to withdraw completely from Croatia . Such action would also require abolishment of the UNPAs , which had been identified as integral parts of Croatia by United Nations Security Council Resolution 815 of 30 March 1993 . Two days later , the Secretary @-@ General reported to the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ) that UNPROFOR was unable to implement important elements of the Vance plan , enforce a ceasefire , or protect its own vehicles against hijackings in the UNPAs . 
 On 31 January , US ambassador Peter Galbraith unsuccessfully tried to persuade Tuđman 's aide Hrvoje Šarinić to accept another extension of the UNPROFOR mandate , explaining that the conflict would inevitably escalate once the UN force withdrew . This rebuff was followed by harsh French and UK diplomatic responses calling on the UN to ignore the Croatian decision , which resulted in Tuđman dismissing any extension of the mandate . The US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs , Richard Holbrooke , met Tuđman and suggested to him that if UNPROFOR was permitted to stay , Croatia could count on integration into the European Union and NATO . As a way out of the diplomatic row , Holbrooke proposed that UNPROFOR be replaced by a new mission using the same personnel and organisational structure . Following Croatian agreement , the UNSC adopted Resolution 981 establishing the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia ( UNCRO ) , replacing UNPROFOR in the country . The new mission 's name was devised by Under @-@ Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations Shashi Tharoor . 
 = = Mission = = 
 = = = Mandate and functions = = = 
 The UNCRO mission was established under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter . It was initially scheduled to end on 30 November 1995 , and its mandate was to support implementation of a ceasefire agreed to by Croatia and the RSK on 29 March 1994 , as well as an agreement on economic cooperation made on 2 December 1994 . The former entailed monitoring areas between HV and ARSK forward positions , verification that specific types of heavy weapons were at least 10 or 20 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 or 12 @.@ 4 miles ) away from the forward military positions or placed in storage , maintenance of checkpoints , chairing Joint Commissions , and performance of liaison functions . The economic functions were supporting negotiation and implementation of further economic arrangements and facilitating and supporting activities aimed at opening of transport routes and power and water supply networks . 
 UNCRO was also tasked with delivery of humanitarian aid and control , monitoring , and reporting of any transport of military personnel , supplies , equipment , or weapons across UNCRO @-@ staffed border checkpoints between RSK @-@ held parts of Croatia on one side and Bosnia and Herzegovina or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the other . There were 25 border checkpoints manned by UNCRO . The mandate also directed UNCRO to monitor demilitarisation of the Prevlaka Peninsula at the entrance to the Bay of Kotor , according to the UNSC Resolution 779 . Deployment of UNCRO was formally approved by the UNSC on 28 April . The mission was scheduled to be scaled down in June to 8 @,@ 750 troops from the larger UNPROFOR force in the country . 
 UNCRO was criticised for several reasons . The Secretary @-@ General 's Report to the Council described the failures of UNPROFOR , but the new mission did not address them . There were insufficient troops , having been reduced from UNPROFOR levels by the new mission mandate , and inadequate human and material resources to carry out the mission tasks . As a result , fulfilment of the mission mandate was nearly impossible . While Croatian sources said that the mission name was the only real difference from UNPROFOR , the RSK authorities were not satisfied with the UNCRO mission . Specifically , the RSK objected to the deployment of UNCRO troops along the international borders and to the mission name . Conversely , Croats were pleased that the mission acronym appeared to be an abbreviation of Croatia . In response , Czech UNCRO troops used vehicle licence plates bearing the new mission 's acronym when operating in HV @-@ controlled territory and UNPROFOR plates in areas held by the ARSK due to safety concerns . 
 = = = Order of battle = = = 
 UNCRO was commanded from UN Peace Force Headquarters ( UNPF @-@ HQ ) established in Zagreb . UNPF @-@ HQ controlled UNCRO , the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force ( <unk> ) in the Republic of Macedonia , and UNPROFOR — which was confined to Bosnia and Herzegovina from late March . The UNPF @-@ HQ commander was French Lieutenant General Bernard Janvier . In July , South Korean diplomat Byung Suk Min was appointed as head of UNCRO , with Major General Eid Kamal Al @-@ Rodan of the Royal Jordanian Army as the mission 's military commander . Before Al @-@ Rodan , the post was held by Canadian Lieutenant General Raymond Crabbe . UNCRO was initially deployed to the same parts of Croatia as UNPROFOR , however contemporary UNSC documents no longer referred to them as UNPAs — applying the designations of Sector East , West , North , and South , or " areas under the control of the local Serb authorities " instead . One group of sources refers to the areas of UNCRO deployment as UNPAs , another reflects the UNSC practice and omits the acronym , while others refer to the areas as " former UNPAs " . 
 Troops from Argentina , Belgium , Canada , Czech Republic , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Indonesia , Jordan , Kenya , Nepal , Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Russia , Slovakia , Sweden , Ukraine , and the United States contributed to the mission . When UNCRO replaced UNPROFOR in Croatia in March 1995 , there were 15 @,@ 229 UN troops — including UNPF @-@ HQ personnel — in Croatia . By mid @-@ November , the mission had been scaled down to 7 @,@ 041 personnel , including 164 UN Military Observers and 296 UN Civilian Police ( <unk> ) personnel .

 On 1 May , HV launched Operation Flash and overran the ARSK @-@ held part of Sector West in the course of few days . Šarinić warned Crabbe of the attack hours in advance to allow UNCRO troops to seek shelter . The RSK authorities said that some ARSK units were not able to remove antitank weapons from UNCRO depots in Stara Gradiška and near Pakrac until after the offensive began . These weapons had been stored there pursuant to the March 1994 ceasefire agreement . Nonetheless , UNCRO did not stop ARSK troops from retrieving the weapons . During the fighting , ARSK troops took 15 <unk> members , two interpreters , and 89 Nepalese and Argentinean troops hostage to use as human shields against the HV . HV troops hijacked an UNCRO armoured personnel carrier and a Land Rover to precede HV tanks that were moving west along the A3 motorway . On 3 May , the Argentinean battalion of UNCRO facilitated the surrender of 600 ARSK troops near Pakrac , following an agreement reached between Croatia and the RSK which was mediated by Yasushi Akashi , the personal representative of the UN Secretary @-@ General . During Operation Flash , three Jordanian UNCRO troops were wounded by HV fire . The offensive made clear that the deployment of UNCRO would not deter further Croatian offensives . 
 On 4 August , the HV initiated Operation Storm , which was aimed at recapturing Sectors North and South , which encompassed the bulk of the RSK . UNCRO was notified three hours in advance of the attack , when Šarinić telephoned Janvier . In addition , each HV corps notified the UNCRO sector in the path of its planned advance , and requested written confirmation that the information had been received . UNCRO relayed the information to the RSK authorities . Two days later , UNCRO was requested to protect 35 @,@ 000 Serb civilians accompanying the ARSK as it retreated towards Bosnia and Herzegovina . They were trapped near Topusko when HV troops captured Glina , closing the last road available to them . The UNCRO Ukrainian battalion base was used as a venue for negotiations for the surrender of the trapped ARSK Kordun Corps ; the negotiations were conducted in the presence of UNCRO officers . The commander of UNCRO Sector North signed the surrender agreement as a witness . This offensive also involved actions against UN peacekeepers ; the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , which supported the offensive from the Bihać pocket , attacked UNCRO observation posts manned by Polish troops , while HV troops used several Danish peacekeepers as human shields . During the offensive , ARSK detained five Sector East headquarters staff , several UNCRO vehicles were hijacked , and UN personnel were harassed . Four UN peacekeepers were killed in the offensive — three as a result of HV actions , and one as a result of ARSK fire — and 16 were injured . HV troops also destroyed 98 UN observation posts . 
 Following the two offensives and negotiations led by Akashi , UNCRO continued to supervise the ceasefire in Sector East . The role of UNCRO in Sectors North and South was limited to post @-@ conflict peace @-@ building following an agreement between Croatian authorities and Akashi . By November 1995 , UNCRO had withdrawn to Sector East . Even though the UN had planned to reduce UNCRO to 4 @,@ 190 troops by the end of September , and to approximately 2 @,@ 500 by October , the mission strength remained at more than 7 @,@ 000 troops until November . 
 = = Termination and aftermath = = 
 The UNCRO mission was ended by UNSC Resolution 1025 , passed on 30 November 1995 . The resolution was passed in the wake of the Erdut Agreement between Croatia and representatives of Serbs in Sector East . It defined mechanisms for peaceful restoration of the region to Croatian control and established an interim period ending on 15 January 1996 , when authority was to be transferred from UNCRO to a new transitional force to be deployed to the area . When the interim period expired , the UNSC adopted resolutions 1037 and 1038 , which established the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium in the former Sector East and the United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka . Commencement of the two new missions coincided with NATO 's arrival in Bosnia and Herzegovina to enforce the Dayton Accords . 
 Sixteen UNCRO personnel died during the mission : three Kenyan soldiers were killed ; the Czech , Danish , French , and Russian battalions lost two each ; and the Argentinean , Belgian , Jordanian , Polish , and Ukrainian contingents each lost one . Four of the UNCRO peacekeepers were killed during major combat in the mission area . 
 The United Nations Medal was awarded to troops who served with UNCRO for at least 90 consecutive days . The medal was issued suspended from a ribbon 35 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 4 inches ) wide with a 9 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 35 in ) red stripe with a white border on a blue background , flanked by 6 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 24 in ) stripes — olive green on the left and brown on the right — set 3 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 12 inches ) apart from the white border . 
 = Carole Lombard = 
 Carole Lombard ( born Jane Alice Peters , October 6 , 1908 – January 16 , 1942 ) was an American film actress . She was particularly noted for her energetic , often off @-@ beat roles in the screwball comedies of the 1930s . She was the highest @-@ paid star in Hollywood in the late 1930s . 
 Lombard was born into a wealthy family in Fort Wayne , Indiana , but was raised in Los Angeles by her single mother . At 12 , she was recruited by the film director Allan Dwan and made her screen debut in A Perfect Crime ( 1921 ) . Eager to become an actress , she signed a contract with the Fox Film Corporation at age 16 , but mainly played bit parts . She was dropped by Fox after a car accident left a scar on her face . Lombard appeared in 15 short comedies for Mack Sennett between 1927 and 1929 , and then began appearing in feature films such as High Voltage and The Racketeer . After a successful appearance in The Arizona Kid ( 1930 ) , she was signed to a contract with Paramount Pictures . 
 Paramount quickly began casting Lombard as a leading lady , primarily in drama films . Her fame increased when she married William Powell in 1931 , but the pair divorced two years later . A turning point in Lombard 's career came in 1934 , when she starred in Howard Hawks ' pioneering screwball comedy Twentieth Century . The actress found her niche in this genre , and continued to appear in films such as Hands Across the Table ( 1935 ) - forming a popular partnership with Fred MacMurray , My Man Godfrey ( 1936 ) , for which she was Oscar nominated , and Nothing Sacred ( 1937 ) . During this period , Lombard married " the King of Hollywood " , Clark Gable , and the pair was treated in the media as a celebrity supercouple . Keen to win an Oscar , at the end of the decade , Lombard began to move towards more serious roles . Unsuccessful in this aim , she returned to comedy in Alfred Hitchcock 's Mr. & Mrs. Smith ( 1941 ) and Ernst Lubitsch 's To Be or Not to Be ( 1942 ) – her final film role . 
 Lombard 's career was cut short when she died at the age of 33 in an aircraft crash on Mount Potosi , Nevada , while returning from a War Bond tour . Today , she is remembered as one of the definitive actresses of the screwball comedy genre and American comedy , and ranks among the American Film Institute 's greatest female stars of classic Hollywood cinema . 
 = = Early years = = 
 = = = Childhood = = = 
 Lombard was born in Fort Wayne , Indiana , on October 6 , 1908 . Christened with the name Jane Alice Peters , she was the third child and only daughter of Frederick Christian Peters ( 1875 – 1935 ) and Elizabeth Jayne " Bessie " ( Knight ) Peters ( 1876 – 1942 ) . Her two older brothers , to each of whom she was close , both growing up and in adulthood , were Frederick Charles ( 1902 @-@ 1979 ) and John Stuart ( 1906 @-@ 1956 ) . Lombard 's parents both descended from wealthy families and her early years were lived in comfort , with the biographer Robert <unk> calling it her " silver spoon period " . The marriage between her parents was strained , however , and in October 1914 , her mother took the children and moved to Los Angeles . Although the couple did not divorce , the separation was permanent . Her father 's continued financial support allowed the family to live without worry , if not with the same affluence they had enjoyed in Indiana , and they settled into an apartment near Venice Boulevard in Los Angeles . 
 Described by her biographer Wes Gehring as " a free @-@ spirited tomboy " , the young Lombard was passionately involved in sports and enjoyed watching movies . At Virgil Junior High School , she participated in tennis , volleyball , and swimming , and won trophies for her achievements in athletics . At the age of 12 , this hobby unexpectedly landed Lombard her first screen role . While playing baseball with friends , she caught the attention of the film director Allan Dwan , who later recalled seeing " a cute @-@ looking little tomboy ... out there knocking the hell out of the other kids , playing better baseball than they were . And I needed someone of her type for this picture . " With the encouragement of her mother , Lombard happily took a small role in the melodrama A Perfect Crime ( 1921 ) . She was on set for two days , playing the sister of Monte Blue . Dwan later commented , " She ate it up " .

 A Perfect Crime was not widely distributed , but the brief experience spurred Lombard and her mother to look for more film work . The teenager attended several auditions , but none was successful . While appearing as the queen of Fairfax High School 's May Day Carnival at the age of 15 , she was scouted by an employee of Charlie Chaplin and offered a screen test to appear in his film The Gold Rush ( 1925 ) . Lombard was not given the role , but it raised Hollywood 's awareness of the aspiring actress . Her test was seen by the Vitagraph Film Company , which expressed an interest in signing her to a contract . Although this did not materialize , the condition that she adopt a new first name ( " Jane " was considered too dull ) lasted with Lombard throughout her career . She selected the name " Carol " after a girl with whom she played tennis in middle school . 
 In October 1924 , shortly after these disappointments , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Lombard was signed to a contract with the Fox Film Corporation . How this came about is uncertain : in her lifetime , it was reported that a director for the studio scouted her at a dinner party , but more recent evidence suggests that Lombard 's mother contacted Louella Parsons , the gossip columnist , who then got her a screen test . According to the biographer Larry Swindell , Lombard 's beauty convinced Winfield Sheehan , head of the studio , to sign her to a $ 75 @-@ per @-@ week contract . The teenager abandoned her schooling to embark on this new career . Fox was happy to use the name Carol , but unlike Vitagraph , disliked her surname . From this point , she became " Carol Lombard " , the new name taken from a family friend . 
 The majority of Lombard 's appearances with Fox were bit parts in low @-@ budget Westerns and adventure films . She later commented on her dissatisfaction with these roles : " All I had to do was <unk> prettily at the hero and scream with terror when he battled with the villain . " She fully enjoyed the other aspects of film work , however , such as photo shoots , costume fittings , and socializing with actors on the studio set . Lombard embraced the flapper lifestyle and became a regular at the Coconut Grove nightclub , where she won several Charleston dance competitions . 
 In March 1925 , Fox gave Lombard a leading role in the drama Marriage in Transit , opposite Edmund Lowe . Her performance was well @-@ received , with a reviewer for Motion Picture News writing that she displayed , " good poise and considerable charm . " Despite this , the studio heads were unconvinced that Lombard was leading lady material , and her one @-@ year contract was not renewed . Gehring has suggested that a facial scar she obtained in an automobile accident was a factor in this decision . Fearing that the scar — which ran across her cheek — would ruin her career , the 17 @-@ year @-@ old had an early plastic surgery procedure to make it less visible .

 After a year without work , Lombard obtained a screen test for the " King of Comedy " Mack Sennett . She was offered a contract , and although she initially had reservations about performing in slapstick comedies , the actress joined his company as one of the " Sennett Bathing Beauties " . She appeared in 15 short films between September 1927 and March 1929 , and greatly enjoyed her time at the studio . It gave Lombard her first experiences in comedy and provided valuable training for her future work in the genre . In 1940 , she called her Sennett years " the turning point of [ my ] acting career . " 
 Sennett 's productions were distributed by Pathé Exchange , and in 1928 , the company began casting Lombard in feature films . She had prominent roles in Show Folks and Ned <unk> 's Daughter , where reviewers noted that she made a " good impression " and was " worth watching " . The following year , Pathé elevated Lombard from a supporting player to a leading lady . Her success in Raoul Walsh 's 1928 picture Me , Gangster , opposite June Collyer and Don Terry on his film debut , finally eased the pressure her family had been putting on her to succeed . In Howard <unk> 's High Voltage , her first talking picture , she played a sheriff 's daughter stranded with a group during a snow storm . Her next film , the comedy Big News , cast her opposite Robert Armstrong and was a critical and commercial success . Lombard was reunited with Armstrong for the crime drama The Racketeer , released in late 1929 . The review in Film Daily wrote , " Carol Lombard proves a real surprise , and does her best work to date . In fact , this is the first opportunity she has had to prove that she has the stuff to go over . "

 In 1930 , Lombard returned to Fox for a one @-@ off role in the western The Arizona Kid . It was a big release for the studio , starring the popular actor Warner Baxter , in which Lombard received third billing . Following the success of the film , Paramount Pictures recruited Lombard and signed her to a $ 350 @-@ per @-@ week contract ( gradually increasing to $ 3 @,@ 500 @-@ per @-@ week by 1936 ) . They cast her in the Buddy Rogers comedy Safety in Numbers , and one critic observed of her work , " Lombard proves [ to be ] an ace comedienne . " For her second assignment , Fast and Loose with Miriam Hopkins , Paramount mistakenly credited the actress as " Carole Lombard " . She decided she liked this spelling and it became her permanent screen name . 
 Lombard appeared in five films throughout 1931 , beginning with the Frank Tuttle comedy It Pays to <unk> . Her next two films , Man of the World and Ladies Man , both featured William Powell , Paramount 's top male star . Lombard had been a fan of the actor before they met , attracted to his good looks and debonair screen persona , and they were soon in a relationship . The differences between the pair have been noted by biographers : she was 22 , carefree , and famously foul @-@ mouthed , while he was 38 , intellectual , and sophisticated . Despite their disparate personalities , Lombard married Powell on June 6 , 1931 , at her Beverly Hills home . Talking to the media , she argued for the benefits of " love between two people who are diametrically different " , claiming that their relationship allowed for a " perfect see @-@ saw love " . 
 The marriage to Powell increased Lombard 's fame , while she continued to please critics with her work in Up Pops the Devil and I Take this Woman ( both 1931 ) . In reviews for the latter film , which co @-@ starred Gary Cooper , several critics predicted that Lombard was set to become a major star . She went on to appear in five films throughout 1932 . No One Man and Sinners in the Sun were not successful , but Edward Buzzell 's romantic picture Virtue was well received . After featuring in the drama No More Orchids , Lombard was cast as the wife of a con artist in No Man of Her Own . Her co @-@ star for the picture was Clark Gable , who was rapidly becoming one of Hollywood 's top celebrities . The film was a critical and commercial success , and Wes Gehring writes that it was " arguably Lombard 's finest film appearance " to that point . It was the only picture that Gable and Lombard , future husband and wife , made together . There was no romantic interest at this time however , as she recounted to Garson Kanin : " [ we ] did all kinds of hot love scenes ... and I never got any kind of tremble out of him at all . " 
 In August 1933 , Lombard and Powell divorced after 26 months of marriage , although they remained very good friends until Lombard 's death . At the time , she blamed it on their careers , but in a 1936 interview , she admitted that this " had little to do with the divorce . We were just two completely incompatible people . " She appeared in five films that year , beginning with the drama From Hell to Heaven and continuing with Supernatural , her only horror vehicle . After a small role in The Eagle and the Hawk , a war film starring Fredric March and Cary Grant , she starred in two melodramas : Brief Moment , which critics enjoyed , and White Woman , where she was paired with Charles Laughton .

 The year 1934 marked a high point in Lombard 's career . She began with Wesley Ruggles 's musical drama Bolero , where George Raft and she showcased their dancing skills in an extravagantly staged performance to Maurice Ravel 's " Boléro " . Before filming began , she was offered the lead female role in It Happened One Night , but turned it down because of scheduling conflicts with this production . Bolero was favorably received , while her next film , the musical comedy We 're Not Dressing with Bing Crosby , was a box @-@ office hit . 
 Lombard was then recruited by the director Howard Hawks , a second cousin , to star in his screwball comedy film Twentieth Century which proved a watershed in her career and made her a major star . Hawks had seen the actress inebriated at a party , where he found her to be " hilarious and uninhibited and just what the part needed " , and she was cast opposite John Barrymore . In Twentieth Century , Lombard played an actress who is pursued by her former mentor , a flamboyant Broadway impresario . Hawks and Barrymore were unimpressed with her work in rehearsals , finding that she was " acting " too hard and giving a stiff performance . The director encouraged Lombard to relax , be herself , and act on her instincts . She responded well to this tutoring , and reviews for the film commented on her unexpectedly " fiery talent " — " a Lombard like no Lombard you 've ever seen " . The Los Angeles Times ' critic felt that she was " entirely different " from her formerly cool , " calculated " persona , adding , " she vibrates with life and passion , abandon and <unk> " . 
 The next films in which Lombard appeared were Henry Hathaway 's Now and Forever ( 1934 ) , featuring Gary Cooper and the new child star Shirley Temple , and Lady by Choice ( 1934 ) , which was a critical and commercial success . The Gay Bride ( 1934 ) placed her opposite Chester Morris in a gangster comedy , but this outing was panned by critics . After reuniting with George Raft for another dance picture , Rumba ( 1935 ) , Lombard was given the opportunity to repeat the screwball success of Twentieth Century . In Mitchell Leisen 's Hands Across the Table ( 1935 ) , she portrayed a <unk> in search of a rich husband , played by Fred MacMurray . Critics praised the film , and Photoplay 's reviewer stated that Lombard had reaffirmed her talent for the genre . It is remembered as one of her best films , and the pairing of Lombard and MacMurray proved so successful , that they made three more pictures together . 
 = = = Continued success ( 1936 – 37 ) = = = 
 Lombard 's first film of 1936 was Love Before Breakfast , described by Gehring as " The Taming of the Shrew , screwball style " . In William K. Howard 's The Princess Comes Across , her second comedy with MacMurray , she played a budding actress who wins a film contract by masquerading as a Swedish princess . The performance was considered a satire of Greta Garbo , and was widely praised by critics . Lombard 's success continued as she was recruited by Universal Studios to star in the screwball comedy My Man Godfrey ( 1936 ) . William Powell , who was playing the titular Godfrey , insisted on her being cast as the female lead ; despite their divorce , the pair remained friendly and Powell felt she would be perfect in the role of Irene , a zany heiress who employs a " forgotten man " as the family butler . The film was directed by Gregory <unk> , who knew Lombard personally and advised that she draw on her " eccentric nature " for the role . She worked hard on the performance , particularly with finding the appropriate facial expressions for Irene . My Man Godfrey was released to great acclaim and was a box office hit . It received six nominations at the 9th Academy Awards , including Lombard for Best Actress . Biographers cite it as her finest performance , and Frederick Ott says it " clearly established [ her ] as a comedienne of the first rank . " 
 By 1937 , Lombard was one of Hollywood 's most popular actresses , and also the highest @-@ paid star in Hollywood following the deal which Myron Selznick negotiated with Paramount that brought her $ 450 @,@ 000 , more than five times the salary of the U.S. President . As her salary was widely reported in the press , Lombard stated that 80 % of her earnings went in taxes , but that she was happy to help improve her country . The comments earned her much positive publicity , and President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent her a personal letter of thanks . 
 Her first release of the year was Leisen 's Swing High , Swing Low , a third pairing with MacMurray . The film focused on a romance between two cabaret performers , and was a critical and commercial success . It had been primarily a drama , with occasional moments of comedy , but for her next project , Lombard returned to the screwball genre . Producer David O. Selznick was eager to make a comedy with the actress , impressed by her work in My Man Godfrey , and hired Ben Hecht to write an original screenplay for her . Nothing Sacred , directed by William Wellman and co @-@ starring Fredric March , satirized the journalism industry and " the gullible urban masses " , with Lombard playing a small @-@ town girl who pretends to be dying and finds her story exploited by a New York reporter . Marking her only appearance in Technicolor , the film was highly praised and was one of Lombard 's personal favorites . 
 Lombard continued with screwball comedies , next starring in what Swindell calls one of her " wackiest " films , True Confession ( 1937 ) . She played a compulsive liar who wrongly confesses to murder . Lombard loved the script and was excited about the project , which reunited her with John Barrymore and was her final appearance with MacMurray . Her prediction that it " smacked of a surefire success " proved accurate , as critics responded positively and it was popular at the box office . 
 = = = Gable marriage , dramatic efforts ( 1938 – 40 ) = = = 
 True Confession was the last film Lombard made on her Paramount contract , and she remained an independent performer for the rest of her career . Her next film was made at Warner Bros. , where she played a famous actress in Mervyn LeRoy 's Fools for Scandal ( 1938 ) . The comedy met with scathing reviews and was a commercial failure , with Swindell calling it " one of the most horrendous flops of the thirties " . 
 Fools for Scandal was the only film Lombard made in 1938 . By this time , she was devoted to a relationship with Clark Gable . Four years after their teaming on No Man of Her Own , the pair had reunited at a Hollywood party and began a romance early in 1936 . The media took great interest in their partnership and frequently questioned if they would wed . Gable was separated from his wife , Rhea Langham , but she did not want to grant him a divorce . As his relationship with Lombard became serious , Langham eventually agreed to a settlement worth half a million dollars . The divorce was finalized in March 1939 , and Gable and Lombard eloped in Kingman , Arizona , on March 29 , honeymooning in the nearby mining town of Oatman . The couple — both lovers of the outdoors — bought a 20 @-@ acre ranch in Encino , California , where they kept barnyard animals and enjoyed hunting trips . Almost immediately , Lombard wanted to start a family , but her attempts failed ; after two miscarriages and numerous trips to fertility specialists , she was unable to have children . In early 1938 , Lombard also joined officially the Bahá 'í Faith , of which her mother was a member since 1922 . 
 While continuing with a slower work @-@ rate , Lombard decided to move away from comedies and return to dramatic roles . In 1939 , she appeared in a second David O. Selznick production , Made for Each Other , which paired her with James Stewart to play a couple facing domestic difficulties . Reviews for the film were highly positive , and praised Lombard 's dramatic effort ; financially , it was a disappointment . Lombard 's next appearance came opposite Cary Grant in the John Cromwell romance In Name Only ( 1939 ) , a credit she personally negotiated with RKO Radio Pictures upon hearing of the script and Grant 's involvement . The role mirrored her recent experiences , as she played a woman in love with a married man whose wife refuses to divorce . She was paid $ 150 @,@ 000 for the film , continuing her status as one of Hollywood 's highest @-@ paid actresses , and it was a moderate success . 
 Lombard was eager to win an Academy Award , and selected her next project — from several possible scripts — with the expectation that it would bring her the trophy . Vigil in the Night ( 1940 ) , directed by George Stevens , featured Lombard as a nurse who faces a series of personal difficulties . Although the performance was praised , she did not get her nomination , as the sombre mood of the picture turned audiences away and box @-@ office returns were poor . Despite the realization that she was best suited to comedies , Lombard completed one more drama : They Knew What They Wanted ( 1940 ) , co @-@ starring Charles Laughton , which was mildly successful . 
 = = = Final roles ( 1941 – 1942 ) = = = 
 Accepting that " my name doesn 't sell tickets to serious pictures " , Lombard returned to comedy for the first time in three years to film Mr. & Mrs. Smith ( 1941 ) , about a couple who learns that their marriage is invalid , with Robert Montgomery . Lombard was influential in bringing Alfred Hitchcock , whom she knew through David O. Selznick , to direct one of his most atypical films . It was a commercial success , as audiences were happy with what Swindell calls " the belated happy news ... that Carole Lombard was a screwball once more . " 
 It was nearly a year before Lombard committed to another film , as she focused instead on her home and marriage . Determined that her next film be " an unqualified smash hit " , she was also careful in selecting a new project . Through her agent , Lombard heard of Ernst Lubitsch 's upcoming film : To Be or Not to Be , a dark comedy that satirized the Nazi takeover of Poland . The actress had long wanted to work with Lubitsch , her favorite comedy director , and felt that the material — although controversial — was a worthy subject . Lombard accepted the role of actress Maria Tura , despite it being a smaller part than she was used to , and was given top billing over the film 's lead , Jack Benny . Filming took place in the fall of 1941 , and was reportedly one of the happiest experiences of Lombard 's career .

 When the U.S. entered World War II at the end of 1941 , Lombard traveled to her home state of Indiana for a war bond rally with her mother , Bess Peters , and Clark Gable 's press agent , Otto Winkler . Lombard was able to raise over $ 2 million ( $ 34 @,@ 993 @,@ 987 @.@ 92 in 2016 ) in defense bonds in a single evening . Her party had initially been scheduled to return to Los Angeles by train , but Lombard was anxious to reach home more quickly and wanted to fly by a scheduled airline . Her mother and Winkler were both afraid of flying and insisted they follow their original travel plans . Lombard suggested they flip a coin ; they agreed and Lombard won the toss . 
 In the early morning hours of January 16 , 1942 , Lombard , her mother , and Winkler boarded a Transcontinental and Western Air Douglas DST ( Douglas Sleeper Transport ) aircraft to return to California . After refueling in Las Vegas , TWA Flight 3 took off at 7 : 07 p.m. and around 13 minutes later , crashed into " Double Up Peak " near the 8 @,@ 300 @-@ foot ( 2 @,@ 500 m ) level of Potosi Mountain , 32 statute miles ( 51 km ) southwest of Las Vegas . All 22 aboard , Lombard and her mother included , plus 15 army servicemen , were killed instantly .

 Gable was flown to Las Vegas after learning of the tragedy to claim the bodies of his wife , mother @-@ in @-@ law , and Winkler , who aside from being his press agent , had been a close friend . Lombard 's funeral was held on January 21 at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale , California . She was interred beside her mother under the name of Carole Lombard Gable . Despite remarrying twice following her death , Gable chose to be interred beside Lombard when he died in 1960 . 
 Lombard 's final film , To Be or Not to Be ( 1942 ) , directed by Ernst Lubitsch and co @-@ starring Jack Benny , a satire about Nazism and World War II , was in post @-@ production at the time of her death . The film 's producers decided to cut part of the film in which Lombard 's character asks , " What can happen on a plane ? " out of respect for the circumstances surrounding her death . When the film was released , it received mixed reviews , particularly about its controversial content , but Lombard 's performance was hailed as the perfect send @-@ off to one of 1930s Hollywood 's most important stars . 
 At the time of her death , Lombard had been scheduled to star in the film They All Kissed the Bride ; when production started , she was replaced by Joan Crawford . Crawford donated all of her salary for the film to the Red Cross , which had helped extensively in the recovery of bodies from the air crash . Shortly after Lombard 's death , Gable , who was inconsolable and devastated by his loss , joined the United States Army Air Forces . Lombard had asked him to do that numerous times after the United States had entered World War II . After officer training , Gable headed a six @-@ man motion picture unit attached to a B @-@ 17 bomb group in England to film aerial gunners in combat , flying five missions himself . In December 1943 , the United States Maritime Commission announced that a Liberty ship named after Carole Lombard would be launched . Gable attended the launch of the SS Carole Lombard on January 15 , 1944 , the two @-@ year anniversary of Lombard 's record @-@ breaking war bond drive . The ship was involved in rescuing hundreds of survivors from sunken ships in the Pacific and returning them to safety . 
 In 1962 , Mrs. Jill Winkler Rath , widow of publicist Otto Winkler , filed an unsuccessful lawsuit for $ 100 @,@ 000 against the $ 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 estate of Clark Gable in connection with Winkler 's death in the plane crash with Carole Lombard . The suit was dismissed in Los Angeles Superior Court . Mrs. Rath , in her action , claimed Gable promised to provide financial aid for her if she would not bring suit against the airline involved . However , Mrs. Rath stated , she later learned that Gable settled his claim against the airline for $ 10 . He did so because he did not want to repeat his grief in court and subsequently provided her no financial aid in his will .

 Author Robert D. <unk> has cited Lombard as " among the most commercially successful and admired film personalities in Hollywood in the 1930s " , and feminist writer June <unk> believes that Lombard " demonstrated great knowledge of the mechanics of film making " . George Raft , her co @-@ star in Bolero , was extremely fond of the actress , remarking " I truly loved Carole Lombard . She was the greatest girl that ever lived and we were the best of pals . Completely honest and outspoken , she was liked by everyone " . 
 Lombard was particularly noted for the zaniness of her performances , described as a " natural prankster , a salty tongued straight @-@ shooter , a feminist precursor and one of the few stars who was beloved by the technicians and studio functionaries who worked with her " . Life magazine noted that her film personality transcended to real life , " her conversation , often brilliant , is punctuated by screeches , laughs , growls , gesticulations and the expletives of a sailor 's parrot " . Graham Greene praised the " heartbreaking and nostalgic melodies " of her faster @-@ than @-@ thought delivery . " Platinum blonde , with a heart @-@ shaped face , delicate , impish features and a figure made to be swathed in silver lamé , Lombard wriggled expressively through such classics of hysteria as Twentieth Century and My Man Godfrey . " 
 In 1999 , the American Film Institute ranked Lombard 23rd on its list of the 25 greatest American female screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema , and she has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame , at 6930 Hollywood Blvd . Lombard received one Academy Award for Best Actress nomination , for My Man Godfrey . Actresses who have portrayed her in films include Jill Clayburgh in Gable and Lombard ( 1976 ) , Sharon <unk> in Moviola : The Scarlett O 'Hara War ( 1980 ) , Denise Crosby in Malice in Wonderland ( 1985 ) , Anastasia Hille in RKO 281 ( 1999 ) and Vanessa Gray in Lucy ( 2003 ) . Lombard 's Fort Wayne childhood home has been designated a historic landmark . The city named the nearby bridge over the St. Mary 's River the Carole Lombard Memorial Bridge .

 = Musical instrument = 
 A musical instrument is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds . In principle , any object that produces sound can be a musical instrument — it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument . The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture . Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual , such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt , or a drum in a religious ceremony . Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment . Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications . 
 The date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is disputed . The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument , a simple flute , dates back as far as 67 @,@ 000 years . Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37 @,@ 000 years ago . However , most historians believe that determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible due to the subjectivity of the definition and the relative instability of materials used to make them . Many early musical instruments were made from animal skins , bone , wood , and other non @-@ durable materials . 
 Musical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the world . However , contact among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most instruments in places far from their origin . By the Middle Ages , instruments from Mesopotamia were in maritime Southeast Asia , and Europeans played instruments from North Africa . Development in the Americas occurred at a slower pace , but cultures of North , Central , and South America shared musical instruments . By 1400 , musical instrument development slowed in many areas and was dominated by the Occident . 
 Musical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right , and many systems of classification have been used over the years . Instruments can be classified by their effective range , their material composition , their size , etc . However , the most common academic method , Hornbostel @-@ Sachs , uses the means by which they produce sound . The academic study of musical instruments is called <unk> . 
 = = Definition and basic operation = = 
 A musical instrument makes sounds . Once humans moved from making sounds with their bodies — for example , by clapping — to using objects to create music from sounds , musical instruments were born . Primitive instruments were probably designed to emulate natural sounds , and their purpose was ritual rather than entertainment . The concept of melody and the artistic pursuit of musical composition were unknown to early players of musical instruments . A player sounding a flute to signal the start of a hunt does so without thought of the modern notion of " making music " . 
 Musical instruments are constructed in a broad array of styles and shapes , using many different materials . Early musical instruments were made from " found objects " such a shells and plant parts . As instruments evolved , so did the selection and quality of materials . Virtually every material in nature has been used by at least one culture to make musical instruments . One plays a musical instrument by interacting with it in some way — for example , by plucking the strings on a string instrument . 
 = = Archaeology = = 
 Researchers have discovered archaeological evidence of musical instruments in many parts of the world . Some finds are 67 @,@ 000 years old , however their status as musical instruments is often in dispute . Consensus solidifies about artifacts dated back to around 37 @,@ 000 years old and later . Only artifacts made from durable materials or using durable methods tend to survive . As such , the specimens found cannot be irrefutably placed as the earliest musical instruments . 
 In July 1995 , Slovenian archaeologist Ivan Turk discovered a bone carving in the northwest region of Slovenia . The carving , named the <unk> Babe Flute , features four holes that Canadian musicologist Bob Fink determined could have been used to play four notes of a diatonic scale . Researchers estimate the flute 's age at between 43 @,@ 400 and 67 @,@ 000 years , making it the oldest known musical instrument and the only musical instrument associated with the Neanderthal culture . However , some archaeologists and ethnomusicologists dispute the flute 's status as a musical instrument . German archaeologists have found mammoth bone and swan bone flutes dating back to 30 @,@ 000 to 37 @,@ 000 years old in the Swabian Alps . The flutes were made in the Upper Paleolithic age , and are more commonly accepted as being the oldest known musical instruments . 
 Archaeological evidence of musical instruments was discovered in excavations at the Royal Cemetery in the Sumerian city of Ur . These instruments , one of the first ensembles of instruments yet discovered , include nine lyres ( the Lyres of Ur ) , two harps , a silver double flute , sistra and cymbals . A set of reed @-@ sounded silver pipes discovered in Ur was the likely predecessor of modern bagpipes . The cylindrical pipes feature three side @-@ holes that allowed players to produce whole tone scales . These excavations , carried out by Leonard Woolley in the 1920s , uncovered non @-@ degradable fragments of instruments and the voids left by the degraded segments that , together , have been used to reconstruct them . The graves these instruments were buried in have been carbon dated to between 2600 and 2500 BC , providing evidence that these instruments were used in Sumeria by this time . 
 Archaeologists in the Jiahu site of central Henan province of China have found flutes made of bones that date back 7 @,@ 000 to 9 @,@ 000 years , representing some of the " earliest complete , playable , tightly @-@ dated , <unk> musical instruments " ever found . 
 = = History = = 
 Scholars agree that there are no completely reliable methods of determining the exact chronology of musical instruments across cultures . Comparing and organizing instruments based on their complexity is misleading , since advancements in musical instruments have sometimes reduced complexity . For example , construction of early slit drums involved felling and hollowing out large trees ; later slit drums were made by opening bamboo stalks , a much simpler task . 
 German musicologist Curt Sachs , one of the most prominent musicologists and musical ethnologists in modern times , argues that it is misleading to arrange the development of musical instruments by workmanship , since cultures advance at different rates and have access to different raw materials . He maintains , for example , that contemporary anthropologists comparing musical instruments from two cultures that existed at the same time but differed in organization , culture , and handicraft cannot determine which instruments are more " primitive " . Ordering instruments by geography is also not totally reliable , as it cannot always be determined when and how cultures contacted one another and shared knowledge . 
 Sachs proposed that a geographical chronology until approximately 1400 is preferable , however , due to its limited subjectivity . Beyond 1400 , one can follow the overall development of musical instruments by time period . 
 The science of marking the order of musical instrument development relies on archaeological artifacts , artistic depictions , and literary references . Since data in one research path can be inconclusive , all three paths provide a better historical picture . 
 = = = Primitive and prehistoric = = = 
 Until the 19th century AD , European @-@ written music histories began with mythological accounts of how musical instruments were invented . Such accounts included Jubal , descendant of Cain and " father of all such as handle the harp and the organ " , Pan , inventor of the pan pipes , and Mercury , who is said to have made a dried tortoise shell into the first lyre . Modern histories have replaced such mythology with anthropological speculation , occasionally informed by archeological evidence . Scholars agree that there was no definitive " invention " of the musical instrument since the definition of the term " musical instrument " is completely subjective to both the scholar and the would @-@ be inventor . For example , a Homo <unk> slapping his body could be the makings of a musical instrument regardless of the being 's intent . 
 Among the first devices external to the human body that are considered instruments are rattles , <unk> , and various drums . These earliest instruments evolved due to the human motor impulse to add sound to emotional movements such as dancing . Eventually , some cultures assigned ritual functions to their musical instruments , using them for hunting and various ceremonies . Those cultures developed more complex percussion instruments and other instruments such as ribbon reeds , flutes , and trumpets . Some of these labels carry far different connotations from those used in modern day ; early flutes and trumpets are so @-@ labeled for their basic operation and function rather than any resemblance to modern instruments . Among early cultures for whom drums developed ritual , even sacred importance are the Chukchi people of the Russian Far East , the indigenous people of Melanesia , and many cultures of Africa . In fact , drums were pervasive throughout every African culture . One East African tribe , the <unk> , believed it was so holy that seeing a drum would be fatal to any person other than the sultan . 
 Humans eventually developed the concept of using musical instruments for producing a melody . Until this time in the evolutions of musical instruments , melody was common only in singing . Similar to the process of reduplication in language , instrument players first developed repetition and then arrangement . An early form of melody was produced by pounding two stamping tubes of slightly different sizes — one tube would produce a " clear " sound and the other would answer with a " darker " sound . Such instrument pairs also included <unk> , slit drums , shell trumpets , and skin drums . Cultures who used these instrument pairs associated genders with them ; the " father " was the bigger or more energetic instrument , while the " mother " was the smaller or duller instrument . Musical instruments existed in this form for thousands of years before patterns of three or more tones would evolve in the form of the earliest xylophone . <unk> originated in the mainland and archipelago of Southeast Asia , eventually spreading to Africa , the Americas , and Europe . Along with xylophones , which ranged from simple sets of three " leg bars " to carefully tuned sets of parallel bars , various cultures developed instruments such as the ground harp , ground zither , musical bow , and jaw harp . 
 = = = Antiquity = = = 
 Images of musical instruments begin to appear in Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 BC or earlier . Beginning around 2000 BC , Sumerian and Babylonian cultures began delineating two distinct classes of musical instruments due to division of labor and the evolving class system . Popular instruments , simple and playable by anyone , evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill . Despite this development , very few musical instruments have been recovered in Mesopotamia . Scholars must rely on artifacts and cuneiform texts written in Sumerian or Akkadian to reconstruct the early history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia . Even the process of assigning names to these instruments is challenging since there is no clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them . 
 Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly depicted ceremonial instruments , historians have been able to distinguish six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia : concussion clubs , clappers , sistra , bells , cymbals , and rattles . <unk> are depicted prominently in a great relief of Amenhotep III , and are of particular interest because similar designs have been found in far @-@ reaching places such as Tbilisi , Georgia and among the Native American Yaqui tribe . The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments to any other , as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines , plaques , and seals . Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted , as well as lyres and lutes , the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the violin . 
 Musical instruments used by the Egyptian culture before 2700 BC bore striking similarity to those of Mesopotamia , leading historians to conclude that the civilizations must have been in contact with one another . Sachs notes that Egypt did not possess any instruments that the Sumerian culture did not also possess . However , by 2700 BC the cultural contacts seem to have dissipated ; the lyre , a prominent ceremonial instrument in Sumer , did not appear in Egypt for another 800 years . <unk> and concussion sticks appear on Egyptian vases as early as 3000 BC . The civilization also made use of sistra , vertical flutes , double clarinets , arched and angular harps , and various drums . 
 Little history is available in the period between 2700 BC and 1500 BC , as Egypt ( and indeed , Babylon ) entered a long violent period of war and destruction . This period saw the Kassites destroy the Babylonian empire in Mesopotamia and the Hyksos destroy the Middle Kingdom of Egypt . When the Pharaohs of Egypt conquered Southwest Asia in around 1500 BC , the cultural ties to Mesopotamia were renewed and Egypt 's musical instruments also reflected heavy influence from Asiatic cultures . Under their new cultural influences , the people of the New Kingdom began using oboes , trumpets , lyres , lutes , castanets , and cymbals . 
 In contrast with Mesopotamia and Egypt , professional musicians did not exist in Israel between 2000 and 1000 BC . While the history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia and Egypt relies on artistic representations , the culture in Israel produced few such representations . Scholars must therefore rely on information gleaned from the Bible and the Talmud . The Hebrew texts mention two prominent instruments associated with Jubal : the <unk> ( pipes ) and <unk> ( lyre ) . Other instruments of the period included the <unk> ( frame drum ) , pa <unk> ( small bells or jingles ) , shofar , and the trumpet @-@ like <unk> . 
 The introduction of a monarchy in Israel during the 11th century BC produced the first professional musicians and with them a drastic increase in the number and variety of musical instruments . However , identifying and classifying the instruments remains a challenge due to the lack of artistic interpretations . For example , stringed instruments of uncertain design called <unk> and <unk> existed , but neither archaeology nor etymology can clearly define them . In her book A Survey of Musical Instruments , American musicologist Sibyl Marcuse proposes that the <unk> must be similar to vertical harp due to its relation to <unk> , the Phoenician term for " harp " . 
 In Greece , Rome , and Etruria , the use and development of musical instruments stood in stark contrast to those cultures ' achievements in architecture and sculpture . The instruments of the time were simple and virtually all of them were imported from other cultures . Lyres were the principal instrument , as musicians used them to honor the gods . Greeks played a variety of wind instruments they classified as aulos ( reeds ) or syrinx ( flutes ) ; Greek writing from that time reflects a serious study of reed production and playing technique . Romans played reed instruments named tibia , featuring side @-@ holes that could be opened or closed , allowing for greater flexibility in playing modes . Other instruments in common use in the region included vertical harps derived from those of the Orient , lutes of Egyptian design , various pipes and organs , and clappers , which were played primarily by women . 
 Evidence of musical instruments in use by early civilizations of India is almost completely lacking , making it impossible to reliably attribute instruments to the Munda and Dravidian language @-@ speaking cultures that first settled the area . Rather , the history of musical instruments in the area begins with the Indus Valley Civilization that emerged around 3000 BC . Various rattles and whistles found among excavated artifacts are the only physical evidence of musical instruments . A clay statuette indicates the use of drums , and examination of the Indus script has also revealed representations of vertical arched harps identical in design to those depicted in Sumerian artifacts . This discovery is among many indications that the Indus Valley and Sumerian cultures maintained cultural contact . Subsequent developments in musical instruments in India occurred with the Rigveda , or hymns . These songs used various drums , shell trumpets , harps , and flutes . Other prominent instruments in use during the early centuries AD were the snake charmer 's double clarinet , bagpipes , barrel drums , cross flutes , and short lutes . In all , India had no unique musical instruments until the Middle Ages . 
 Musical instruments such as zithers appeared in Chinese writings around 12th century BC and earlier . Early Chinese philosophers such as Confucius ( 551 – 479 BC ) , Mencius ( 372 – 289 BC ) , and Laozi shaped the development of musical instruments in China , adopting an attitude toward music similar to that of the Greeks . The Chinese believed that music was an essential part of character and community , and developed a unique system of classifying their musical instruments according to their material makeup . 
 Idiophones were extremely important in Chinese music , hence the majority of early instruments were idiophones . Poetry of the Shang dynasty mentions bells , chimes , drums , and globular flutes carved from bone , the latter of which has been excavated and preserved by archaeologists . The Zhou dynasty saw percussion instruments such as clappers , troughs , wooden fish , and <unk> ( wooden tiger ) . Wind instruments such as flute , pan @-@ pipes , pitch @-@ pipes , and mouth organs also appeared in this time period . The <unk> ( an end @-@ blown flute ) and various other instruments that spread through many cultures , came into use in China during and after the Han dynasty . 
 Although civilizations in Central America attained a relatively high level of sophistication by the eleventh century AD , they lagged behind other civilizations in the development of musical instruments . For example , they had no stringed instruments ; all of their instruments were idiophones , drums , and wind instruments such as flutes and trumpets . Of these , only the flute was capable of producing a melody . In contrast , pre @-@ Columbian South American civilizations in areas such as modern @-@ day Peru , Colombia , Ecuador , Bolivia , and Chile were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically . South American cultures of the time used pan @-@ pipes as well as varieties of flutes , idiophones , drums , and shell or wood trumpets . 
 = = = Middle Ages = = = 
 During the period of time loosely referred to as the Middle Ages , China developed a tradition of integrating musical influence from other regions . The first record of this type of influence is in 384 AD , when China established an orchestra in its imperial court after a conquest in Turkestan . Influences from Middle East , Persia , India , Mongolia , and other countries followed . In fact , Chinese tradition attributes many musical instruments from this period to those regions and countries . <unk> gained popularity , along with more advanced trumpets , clarinets , oboes , flutes , drums , and lutes . Some of the first bowed zithers appeared in China in the 9th or 10th century , influenced by Mongolian culture . 
 India experienced similar development to China in the Middle Ages ; however , stringed instruments developed differently as they accommodated different styles of music . While stringed instruments of China were designed to produce precise tones capable of matching the tones of chimes , stringed instruments of India were considerably more flexible . This flexibility suited the slides and tremolos of Hindu music . Rhythm was of paramount importance in Indian music of the time , as evidenced by the frequent depiction of drums in reliefs dating to the Middle Ages . The emphasis on rhythm is an aspect native to Indian music . Historians divide the development of musical instruments in medieval India between pre @-@ Islamic and Islamic periods due to the different influence each period provided . 
 In pre @-@ Islamic times , idiophones such hand bells , cymbals , and peculiar instruments resembling gongs came into wide use in Hindu music . The gong @-@ like instrument was a bronze disk that was struck with a hammer instead of a mallet . Tubular drums , stick zithers ( veena ) , short fiddles , double and triple flutes , coiled trumpets , and curved India horns emerged in this time period . Islamic influences brought new types of drums , perfectly circular or octagonal as opposed to the irregular pre @-@ Islamic drums . Persian influence brought oboes and sitars , although Persian sitars had three strings and Indian version had from four to seven . 
 Southeast Asian musical innovations include those during a period of Indian influence that ended around 920 AD . Balinese and Javanese music made use of xylophones and <unk> , bronze versions of the former . The most prominent and important musical instrument of Southeast Asia was the gong . While the gong likely originated in the geographical area between Tibet and Burma , it was part of every category of human activity in maritime Southeast Asia including Java . 
 The areas of Mesopotamia and the Arabian Peninsula experiences rapid growth and sharing of musical instruments once they were united by Islamic culture in the seventh century . Frame drums and cylindrical drums of various depths were immensely important in all genres of music . Conical oboes were involved in the music that accompanied wedding and circumcision ceremonies . Persian miniatures provide information on the development of kettle drums in Mesopotamia that spread as far as Java . Various lutes , zithers , dulcimers , and harps spread as far as Madagascar to the south and modern @-@ day Sulawesi to the east . 
 Despite the influences of Greece and Rome , most musical instruments in Europe during the <unk> Ages came from Asia . The lyre is the only musical instrument that may have been invented in Europe until this period . <unk> instruments were prominent in Middle Age Europe . The central and northern regions used mainly lutes , stringed instruments with necks , while the southern region used lyres , which featured a two @-@ armed body and a crossbar . Various harps served Central and Northern Europe as far north as Ireland , where the harp eventually became a national symbol . Lyres propagated through the same areas , as far east as Estonia . 
 European music between 800 and 1100 became more sophisticated , more frequently requiring instruments capable of polyphony . The 9th @-@ century Persian geographer Ibn Khordadbeh mentioned in his lexicographical discussion of music instruments that , in the Byzantine Empire , typical instruments included the urghun ( organ ) , <unk> ( probably a type of harp or lyre ) , <unk> ( probably a bagpipe ) and the lyra . The Byzantine lyra , a bowed string instrument , is an ancestor of most European bowed instruments , including the violin . 
 The <unk> served as a precise measure of the notes of a musical scale , allowing more accurate musical arrangements . Mechanical hurdy @-@ <unk> allowed single musicians to play more complicated arrangements than a fiddle would ; both were prominent folk instruments in the Middle Ages . Southern Europeans played short and long lutes whose pegs extended to the sides , unlike the rear @-@ facing pegs of Central and Northern European instruments . Idiophones such as bells and clappers served various practical purposes , such as warning of the approach of a leper . 
 The ninth century revealed the first bagpipes , which spread throughout Europe and had many uses from folk instruments to military instruments . The construction of pneumatic organs evolved in Europe starting in fifth @-@ century Spain , spreading to England in about 700 . The resulting instruments varied in size and use from portable organs worn around the neck to large pipe organs . Literary accounts of organs being played in English Benedictine abbeys toward the end of the tenth century are the first references to organs being connected to churches . Reed players of the Middle Ages were limited to oboes ; no evidence of clarinets exists during this period .

 = = = = Renaissance = = = = 
 Musical instrument development was dominated by the Occident from 1400 on , indeed , the most profound changes occurred during the Renaissance period . Instruments took on other purposes than accompanying singing or dance , and performers used them as solo instruments . Keyboards and lutes developed as polyphonic instruments , and composers arranged increasingly complex pieces using more advanced <unk> . Composers also began designing pieces of music for specific instruments . In the latter half of the sixteenth century , orchestration came into common practice as a method of writing music for a variety of instruments . Composers now specified orchestration where individual performers once applied their own discretion . The polyphonic style dominated popular music , and the instrument makers responded accordingly . 
 Beginning in about 1400 , the rate of development of musical instruments increased in earnest as compositions demanded more dynamic sounds . People also began writing books about creating , playing , and cataloging musical instruments ; the first such book was Sebastian Virdung 's 1511 treatise Musica <unk> und <unk> ( ' Music Germanized and <unk> ' ) . Virdung 's work is noted as being particularly thorough for including descriptions of " irregular " instruments such as hunters ' horns and cow bells , though Virdung is critical of the same . Other books followed , including <unk> <unk> 's Spiegel der <unk> und <unk> ( ' Mirror of Organ Makers and Organ Players ' ) the following year , a treatise on organ building and organ playing . Of the instructional books and references published in the Renaissance era , one is noted for its detailed description and depiction of all wind and stringed instruments , including their relative sizes . This book , the <unk> musicum by Michael Praetorius , is now considered an authoritative reference of sixteenth @-@ century musical instruments . 
 In the sixteenth century , musical instrument builders gave most instruments – such as the violin – the " classical shapes " they retain today . An emphasis on aesthetic beauty also developed ; listeners were as pleased with the physical appearance of an instrument as they were with its sound . Therefore , builders paid special attention to materials and workmanship , and instruments became collectibles in homes and museums . It was during this period that makers began constructing instruments of the same type in various sizes to meet the demand of consorts , or ensembles playing works written for these groups of instruments . 
 Instrument builders developed other features that endure today . For example , while organs with multiple keyboards and pedals already existed , the first organs with solo stops emerged in the early fifteenth century . These stops were meant to produce a mixture of timbres , a development needed for the complexity of music of the time . Trumpets evolved into their modern form to improve portability , and players used mutes to properly blend into chamber music . 
 = = = = Baroque = = = = 
 Beginning in the seventeenth century , composers began creating works of a more emotional style . They felt that a monophonic style better suited the emotional music and wrote musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice . As a result , many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics , and therefore were seen as unemotional , fell out of favor . One such instrument was the shawm . Bowed instruments such as the violin , viola , <unk> , and various lutes dominated popular music . Beginning in around 1750 , however , the lute disappeared from musical compositions in favor of the rising popularity of the guitar . As the prevalence of string orchestras rose , wind instruments such as the flute , oboe , and bassoon were readmitted to counteract the monotony of hearing only strings . 
 In the mid @-@ seventeenth century , what was known as a hunter 's horn underwent transformation into an " art instrument " consisting of a lengthened tube , a narrower bore , a wider bell , and much wider range . The details of this transformation are unclear , but the modern horn or , more colloquially , French horn , had emerged by 1725 . The slide trumpet appeared , a variation that includes a long @-@ throated mouthpiece that slid in and out , allowing the player infinite adjustments in pitch . This variation on the trumpet was unpopular due to the difficulty involved in playing it . Organs underwent tonal changes in the Baroque period , as manufacturers such as Abraham Jordan of London made the stops more expressive and added devices such as expressive pedals . Sachs viewed this trend as a " degeneration " of the general organ sound . 
 = = = = Classical and Romantic = = = = 
 During the Classical and Romantic periods of music , lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900 , a great deal of musical instruments capable of producing new timbres and higher volume were developed and introduced into popular music . The design changes that broadened the quality of timbres allowed instruments to produce a wider variety of expression . Large orchestras rose in popularity and , in parallel , the composers determined to produce entire orchestral scores that made use of the expressive abilities of modern instruments . Since instruments were involved in collaborations of a much larger scale , their designs had to evolve to accommodate the demands of the orchestra . 
 Some instruments also had to become louder to fill larger halls and be heard over sizable orchestras . Flutes and bowed instruments underwent many modifications and design changes — most of them unsuccessful — in efforts to increase volume . Other instruments were changed just so they could play their parts in the scores . Trumpets traditionally had a " defective " range — they were incapable of producing certain notes with precision . New instruments such as the clarinet , saxophone , and tuba became fixtures in orchestras . Instruments such as the clarinet also grew into entire " families " of instruments capable of different ranges : small clarinets , normal clarinets , bass clarinets , and so on . 
 Accompanying the changes to timbre and volume was a shift in the typical pitch used to tune instruments . Instruments meant to play together , as in an orchestra , must be tuned to the same standard lest they produce audibly different sounds while playing the same notes . Beginning in 1762 , the average concert pitch began rising from a low of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna . Different regions , countries , and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards , making orchestral collaboration a challenge . Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like Hector Berlioz , no standard could be agreed upon . 
 = = = = Twentieth century to present = = = = 
 The evolution of traditional musical instruments slowed beginning in the twentieth century . Instruments like the violin , flute , french horn , harp , and so on are largely the same as those manufactured throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . Gradual iterations do emerge ; for example , the " New Violin Family " began in 1964 to provide differently sized violins to expand the range of available sounds . The slowdown in development was practical response to the concurrent slowdown in orchestra and venue size . Despite this trend in traditional instruments , the development of new musical instruments exploded in the twentieth century . The sheer variety of instruments developed overshadows any prior period . 
 The proliferation of electricity in the twentieth century lead to the creation of an entirely new category of musical instruments : electronic instruments , or electrophones . The vast majority of electrophones produced in the first half of the twentieth century were what Sachs called " electromechanical instruments " . In other words , they have mechanical parts that produce sound vibrations , and those vibrations are picked up and amplified by electrical components . Examples of electromechanical instruments include Hammond organs and electric guitars . Sachs also defined a subcategory of " <unk> instruments " such as the theremin , which produces music through the player 's hand movements around two antennas . 
 The latter half of the twentieth century saw the gradual evolution of synthesizers — instruments that artificially produce sound using analog or digital circuits and microchips . In the late 1960s , Bob Moog and other inventors began an era of development of commercial synthesizers . One of the first of these instruments was the Moog synthesizer . The modern proliferation of computers and microchips has spawned an entire industry around electronic musical instruments . 
 = = Classification = = 
 There are many different methods of classifying musical instruments . Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument ( material , color , shape , etc . ) , the use for the instrument , the means by which music is produced with the instrument , the range of the instrument , and the instrument 's place in an orchestra or other ensemble . Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group . The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their original area . For example , a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument . Scholars recognize Hornbostel @-@ Sachs as the only system that applies to any culture and , more important , provides only possible classification for each instrument . The most common types of instrument classifications are strings , brass , woodwind , and percussion . 
 = = = Ancient systems = = = 
 An ancient system named the Natya Shastra , written by the sage Bharata Muni and dating from between 200 BC and 200 AD , divides instruments into four main classification groups : instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating strings ; percussion instruments with skin heads ; instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating columns of air ; and " solid " , or non @-@ skin , percussion instruments . This system was adapted to some degree in 12th @-@ century Europe by Johannes de <unk> , who used the terms <unk> ( stringed instruments ) , <unk> ( wind instruments ) , and <unk> ( all percussion instruments ) . In 1880 , Victor @-@ Charles Mahillon adapted the Natya Shastra and assigned Greek labels to the four classifications : <unk> ( stringed instruments ) , membranophones ( skin @-@ head percussion instruments ) , aerophones ( wind instruments ) , and <unk> ( non @-@ skin percussion instruments ) . 
 = = = Hornbostel @-@ Sachs = = = 
 Erich von Hornbostel and Curt Sachs adopted Mahillon 's scheme and published an extensive new scheme for classification in Zeitschrift für <unk> in 1914 . Hornbostel and Sachs used most of Mahillon 's system , but replaced the term <unk> with idiophone . 
 The original Hornbostel @-@ Sachs system classified instruments into four main groups : 
 Idiophones , which produce sound by vibrating the primary body of the instrument itself ; they are sorted into concussion , percussion , shaken , scraped , split , and plucked idiophones , such as claves , xylophone , <unk> , slit drum , mbira , and rattle . 
 <unk> , which produce sound by a vibrating a stretched membrane ; they may be drums ( further sorted by the shape of the shell ) , which are struck by hand , with a stick , or rubbed , but kazoos and other instruments that use a stretched membrane for the primary sound ( not simply to modify sound produced in another way ) are also considered membranophones . 
 <unk> , which produce sound by vibrating one or more strings ; they are sorted into according to the relationship between the string ( s ) and the sounding board or chamber . For example , if the strings are laid out parallel to the sounding board and there is no neck , the instrument is a zither whether it is plucked like an autoharp or struck with hammers like a piano . If the instrument has strings parallel to the sounding board or chamber and the strings extend past the board with a neck , then the instrument is a lute , whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a guitar or uses a membrane like a banjo . 
 <unk> , which produce a sound with a vibrating column of air ; they are sorted into free aerophones such as a <unk> or whip , which move freely through the air ; flutes , which cause the air to pass over a sharp edge ; reed instruments , which use a vibrating reed ; and lip @-@ vibrated aerophones such as trumpets , for which the lips themselves function as vibrating reeds . 
 Sachs later added a fifth category , electrophones , such as theremins , which produce sound by electronic means . Within each category are many subgroups . The system has been criticised and revised over the years , but remains widely used by ethnomusicologists and <unk> . 
 = = = Schaeffner = = = 
 Andre Schaeffner , a curator at the Musée de l 'Homme , disagreed with the Hornbostel @-@ Sachs system and developed his own system in 1932 . Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of a musical instrument , rather than its specific construction or playing method , should always determine its classification . ( Hornbostel @-@ Sachs , for example , divide aerophones on the basis of sound production , but membranophones on the basis of the shape of the instrument ) . His system divided instruments into two categories : instruments with solid , vibrating bodies and instruments containing vibrating air . 
 = = = Range = = = 
 Musical instruments are also often classified by their musical range in comparison with other instruments in the same family . This exercise is useful when placing instruments in context of an orchestra or other ensemble . 
 These terms are named after singing voice classifications : 
 Soprano instruments : flute , violin , soprano saxophone , trumpet , clarinet , oboe , piccolo 
 Alto instruments : alto saxophone , french horn , english horn , viola , alto horn 
 Tenor instruments : trombone , tenor saxophone , guitar , tenor drum 
 Baritone instruments : bassoon , baritone saxophone , bass clarinet , cello , baritone horn , euphonium 
 Bass instruments : double bass , bass guitar , bass saxophone , tuba , bass drum 
 Some instruments fall into more than one category : for example , the cello may be considered tenor , baritone or bass , depending on how its music fits into the ensemble , and the trombone may be alto , tenor , baritone , or bass and the French horn , bass , baritone , tenor , or alto , depending on the range it is played in . Many instruments have their range as part of their name : soprano saxophone , tenor saxophone , baritone horn , alto flute , bass guitar , etc . Additional adjectives describe instruments above the soprano range or below the bass , for example : sopranino saxophone , contrabass clarinet . When used in the name of an instrument , these terms are relative , describing the instrument 's range in comparison to other instruments of its family and not in comparison to the human voice range or instruments of other families . For example , a bass flute 's range is from C3 to F ♯ 6 , while a bass clarinet plays about one octave lower . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The materials used in making musical instruments vary greatly by culture and application . Many of the materials have special significance owing to their source or rarity . Some cultures worked substances from the human body into their instruments . In ancient Mexico , for example , the material drums were made from might contain actual human body parts obtained from sacrificial offerings . In New Guinea , drum makers would mix human blood into the adhesive used to attach the membrane . Mulberry trees are held in high regard in China owing to their mythological significance — instrument makers would hence use them to make zithers . The <unk> believe that making drums from trees struck by lightning gives them a special connection to nature . 
 Musical instrument construction is a specialized trade that requires years of training , practice , and sometimes an apprenticeship . Most makers of musical instruments specialize in one genre of instruments ; for example , a luthier makes only stringed instruments . Some make only one type of instrument such as a piano . Whatever the instrument constructed , the instrument maker must consider materials , construction technique , and decoration , creating a balanced instrument that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing . Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop experimental musical instruments , often meant for individual playing styles developed by the builder himself . 
 = = User interfaces = = 
 Regardless of how the sound in an instrument is produced , many musical instruments have a keyboard as the user @-@ interface . Keyboard instruments are any instruments that are played with a musical keyboard . Every key generates one or more sounds ; most keyboard instruments have extra means ( pedals for a piano , stops and a pedal keyboard for an organ ) to manipulate these sounds . They may produce sound by wind being fanned ( organ ) or pumped ( accordion ) , vibrating strings either hammered ( piano ) or plucked ( harpsichord ) , by electronic means ( synthesizer ) , or in some other way . Sometimes , instruments that do not usually have a keyboard , such as the glockenspiel , are fitted with one . Though they have no moving parts and are struck by mallets held in the player 's hands , they have the same physical arrangement of keys and produce soundwaves in a similar manner .
