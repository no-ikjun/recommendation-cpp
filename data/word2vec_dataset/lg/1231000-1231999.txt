 Later that morning , Dwyer , having heard no word from Peterson since his departure , took off in another airplane to retrace his planned route . Within minutes , at around 9 : 35 a.m. , he spotted the wreckage less than 6 mi ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) northwest of the airport . The sheriff 's office , alerted by Dwyer , dispatched Deputy Bill McGill , who drove to the crash site , a cornfield belonging to Albert Juhl . 
 The Bonanza had impacted terrain at high speed , estimated to have been around 170 mph ( 270 km / h ) , banked steeply to the right and in a nose @-@ down attitude . The right wing tip had struck the ground first , sending the aircraft cartwheeling across the frozen field for 540 feet ( 160 m ) , before coming to rest against a wire fence at the edge of Juhl 's property . 
 The bodies of Holly and Valens had been ejected from the torn fuselage and lay near the wreckage . Richardson 's body had been thrown over the fence and into the cornfield of Juhl 's neighbor Oscar Moffett , while pilot Peterson 's body was entangled in the plane 's wreckage . With the rest of the entourage en route to Minnesota , it fell to ballroom manager Carroll Anderson , who had driven the party to the airport and witnessed the plane 's takeoff , to identify the bodies of the musicians . County coroner Ralph Smiley certified that all four victims died instantly , citing the cause of death as " gross trauma to brain " for the three artists and " brain damage " for the pilot . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Holly 's pregnant wife , María Elena , learned of his death from the reports on television . A widow after only six months of marriage , she suffered a miscarriage shortly after , reportedly due to " psychological trauma " . Holly 's mother , on hearing the news on the radio at home in Lubbock , Texas , screamed and collapsed . María Elena Holly did not attend the funeral and has never visited the gravesite . She later said in an interview : " In a way , I blame myself . I was not feeling well when he left . I was two weeks pregnant , and I wanted Buddy to stay with me , but he had scheduled that tour . It was the only time I wasn 't with him . And I blame myself because I know that , if only I had gone along , Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane . " 
 The " Winter Dance Party " tour did not stop ; Waylon Jennings and Tommy Allsup continued performing for two more weeks , with Jennings taking Holly 's place as lead singer . Meanwhile , the funerals of the victims were being held individually ; Holly and Richardson were buried in Texas , Valens in California , and pilot Peterson in Iowa . 
 = = Official investigation = = 
 The official investigation was carried out by the Civil Aeronautics Board ( CAB , precursor to the NTSB ) . It emerged that pilot Roger Peterson had over four years of flying experience , of which one with Dwyer Flying Service , and had accumulated 711 flying hours , of which 128 on <unk> . He had also logged 52 hours of instrument flying training , although had passed only his written examination , and was not yet qualified to operate in weather that required flying solely by reference to instruments . He , and Dwyer Flying Service itself , was certified to operate only under visual flight rules , which essentially require that the pilot must be able to see where he is going . However , on the night of the accident , the low clouds obscuring the stars , the lack of a visible horizon , and the absence of ground lights over the sparsely populated area would have made visual flight virtually impossible . 
 Furthermore , Peterson , who had failed an instrument <unk> nine months before the accident , had received his instrument training on airplanes equipped with a conventional artificial horizon , as source of aircraft attitude information , while N3794N was equipped with an older @-@ type Sperry F3 attitude gyroscope . Crucially , the two types of instruments display the same aircraft pitch attitude information graphically in opposite ways . 
 The CAB concluded that the accident was due to " the pilot 's unwise decision to embark on a flight " that required instrument flying skills he had not demonstrated to have . A contributing factor was the pilot 's unfamiliarity with the old @-@ style attitude gyroscope fitted on board the aircraft , which may have caused him to believe he was climbing when he was , in fact , descending ( an example of spatial disorientation ) . Another contributing factor was the " seriously inadequate " weather briefing provided to the pilot , which " failed to even mention adverse flying condition which should have been highlighted " .

 On March 6 , 2007 , in Beaumont , Texas , the body of J.P. Richardson was exhumed to rebury it in a more fitting part of the local Forest Lawn cemetery . The musician 's son Jay Perry took the opportunity to have his father 's body re @-@ examined to verify the original findings , and asked forensic anthropologist William Bass to carry out the procedure . 
 Among the rumors surrounding the accident this second examination sought to verify was that an accidental firearm discharge took place on board the aircraft and caused the crash , since two months after the event , a farmer had found at the crash site a .22 pistol known to have belonged to Buddy Holly . Another rumor had Richardson surviving the initial impact and crawling out of the aircraft in search for help , prompted by the fact that his body was found farther from the wreckage than the other three . 
 Dr. Bass and his team took several X @-@ rays of Richardson 's body and eventually concluded that the musician had indeed died instantly from extensive , <unk> fractures to almost all of his bones ; no traces of lead from any bullet was found , either . Coroner Smiley 's original report was therefore confirmed .

 In March 2015 , the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) , the successor to the Civil Aeronautics Board , received a request to reopen the investigation into the accident . The request was made by L. J. Coon , a retired pilot from New England , who felt that the conclusion of the 1959 investigation was inaccurate . Coon suspected a possible failure of the right rudder , or a problem with the fuel system , as well as a possible improper weight distribution . Coon also argued that Peterson may have tried to land the plane and that his efforts should be recognized . In April 2015 , the NTSB declined the request , citing that the evidence presented by Coon was insufficient to merit the reconsideration of the original findings .

 = Alvin Plantinga 's free will defense = 
 Alvin Plantinga 's version of the free will defense is an attempt to refute the logical problem of evil : the argument that the existence of an omnipotent , omniscient , omnibenevolent God in an evil world is a logical contradiction . 
 The core of the argument is the definition of " omnipotence " . Plantinga argues that God , in spite of being omnipotent , has some limitations on his power . 
 Plantinga 's argument is that " It is possible that God , even being omnipotent , could not create a world with free creatures who never choose evil . Furthermore , it is possible that God , even being omnibenevolent , would desire to create a world , which contains evil if moral goodness requires free moral creatures . " While Plantinga 's free will defense has received fairly widespread acceptance among theologians , many still contend that it fails to adequately resolve the problem of evil , or that it only addresses moral evil , not natural evil , or that it requires an <unk> libertarian view of free will in order to be effective . 
 = = Logical problem of evil = = 
 The logical problem of evil emerges from four core propositions : 
 An all @-@ powerful ( omnipotent ) God could prevent evil from existing in the world . 
 An all @-@ knowing ( omniscient ) God would know that there was evil in the world . 
 An all @-@ good ( omnibenevolent ) God would wish to prevent evil from existing in the world . 
 There is evil in the world . 
 As J. L. Mackie has highlighted , there would appear to be a contradiction between these propositions such that they cannot all be true . Given that the fourth proposition would appear to be undeniable , it can be inferred from the above that one of the other three must be false , and thus there cannot be an all @-@ good , all @-@ knowing and all @-@ powerful God . To put it another way , if God does exist , He must be either " impotent , ignorant or wicked " . 
 The problem , and various solutions to it , have been debated by philosophers since at least the time of Epicurus in the fourth century BC . One of the most historically significant replies to the problem is the free will theodicy of Augustine of Hippo , which has been extensively criticized . 
 = = Plantinga 's argument = = 
 As opposed to a theodicy ( a justification for God 's actions ) , Plantinga puts forth a defense , offering a new proposition that is intended to demonstrate that it is logically possible for an omnibenevolent , omnipotent and omniscient God to create a world that contains moral evil . Significantly , Plantinga does not need to assert that his new proposition is true , merely that it is logically valid . In this way Plantinga 's approach differs from that of a traditional theodicy , which would strive to show not just that the new propositions are sound , but that they are also either true , prima facie plausible , or that there are good grounds for making them . Thus the burden of proof on Plantinga is lessened , and yet his approach may still serve as a defense against the claim by Mackie that the simultaneous existence of evil and an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God is " positively irrational " . 
 As Plantinga summarised his defense : 
 A world containing creatures who are significantly free ( and freely perform more good than evil actions ) is more valuable , all else being equal , than a world containing no free creatures at all . Now God can create free creatures , but He can 't cause or determine them to do only what is right . For if He does so , then they aren 't significantly free after all ; they do not do what is right freely . To create creatures capable of moral good , therefore , He must create creatures capable of moral evil ; and He can 't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil and at the same time prevent them from doing so . As it turned out , sadly enough , some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom ; this is the source of moral evil . The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong , however , counts neither against God 's omnipotence nor against His goodness ; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good . 
 Plantinga 's argument is that even though God is omnipotent , it is possible that it was not in his power to create a world containing moral good but no moral evil ; therefore , there is no logical inconsistency involved when God , although wholly good , creates a world of free creatures who chose to do evil . The argument relies on the following propositions : 
 There are possible worlds that even an omnipotent being can not actualize . 
 A world with morally free creatures producing only moral good is such a world . 
 Plantinga refers to the first statement as " Leibniz 's lapse " as the opposite was assumed by Leibniz . The second proposition is more contentious . Plantinga rejects the compatibilist notion of freedom whereby God could directly cause agents to only do good without sacrificing their freedom . Although it would contradict a creature 's freedom if God were to cause , or in Plantinga 's terms strongly actualize , a world where creatures only do good , an omniscient God would still know the circumstances under which creatures would go wrong . Thus , God could avoid creating such circumstances , thereby weakly actualizing a world with only moral good . Plantinga 's crucial argument is that this possibility may not be available to God because all possible morally free creatures suffer from " transworld depravity " . 
 = = = Transworld depravity = = = 
 Plantinga 's idea of weakly actualizing a world can be viewed as having God actualizing a subset of the world , letting the free choices of creatures complete the world . Therefore , it is certainly possible that a person completes the world by only making morally good choices ; that is , there exist possible worlds where a person freely chooses to do no moral evil . However , it may be the case that for each such world , there is some morally significant choice that this person would do differently if these circumstances were to occur in the actual world . In other words , each such possible world contains a world segment , meaning everything about that world up to the point where the person must make that critical choice , such that if that segment was part of the actual world , the person would instead go wrong in completing that world . Formally , transworld depravity is defined as follows : 
 A person P suffers from transworld depravity if and only if the following holds : for every world W such that P is significantly free in W and P does only what is right in W , there is an action A and a maximal world segment S ´ such that 
 S ´ includes A ' s being morally significant for P 
 S ´ includes P ' s being free with respect to A 
 S ´ is included in W and includes neither P ' s performing A nor P ' s refraining from performing A 
 If S ´ were actual , P would go wrong with respect to A. 
 Less formally : Consider all possible ( not actual ) worlds in which you always choose the right . In all those , there will be a <unk> of the world that says you were free to choose a certain right or wrong action , but does not say whether you chose it . If that <unk> were actual ( in the real world ) , then you 'd chose the wrong . 
 Plantinga says that " What is important about the idea of transworld depravity is that if a person suffers from it , then it wasn 't within God 's power to actualize any world in which that person is significantly free but does no wrong — that is , a world in which he produces moral good but no moral evil " and that it is logically possible that every person suffers from transworld depravity . 
 = = Reception = = 
 According to Chad Meister , professor of philosophy at Bethel College , most philosophers accept Plantinga 's free will defense and thus see the logical problem of evil as having been sufficiently rebutted . Robert Adams says that " it is fair to say that Plantinga has solved this problem . That is , he has argued convincingly for the consistency of God and evil . " William Alston has said that " Plantinga [ ... ] has established the possibility that God could not actualize a world containing free creatures that always do the right thing . " William L. Rowe has written " granted <unk> , there is a fairly compelling argument for the view that the existence of evil is logically consistent with the existence of the theistic God " , referring to Plantinga 's argument . 
 In Arguing about Gods , Graham Oppy offers a dissent , acknowledging that " [ m ] any philosophers seem to suppose that [ Plantinga 's free will defense ] utterly demolishes the kinds of ' logical ' arguments from evil developed by Mackie " but continuing " I am not sure this is a correct assessment of the current state of play " . Concurring with Oppy , A.M. Weisberger writes “ contrary to popular theistic opinion , the logical form of the argument is still alive and beating . ” Among contemporary philosophers , most discussion on the problem of evil presently revolves around the evidential problem of evil , namely that the existence of God is unlikely , rather than illogical . 
 = = Criticisms = = 
 Derk <unk> while acknowledging that " many of those involved in this debate agree that Plantinga has provided a successful response to the abstract logical problem of evil " , delineates a number objections , including the following : 
 Michael Tooley insists that the more pressing problem is the logical compatibility of the existence of God with the actual evils in the world , a problem referred to as " the logical problem of horrendous evil " by Marilyn McCord Adams . 
 David Lewis argues that even if each person would go wrong for some world segments , it would be possible for God to cause the person to do the right thing in just these cases , preserving selectively some significant moral freedom . 
 = = = <unk> view of free will = = = 
 Critics of Plantinga 's argument , such as philosophers J. L. Mackie and Antony Flew , have responded that it presupposes a libertarian , <unk> view of free will ( free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible ) , while their view is a compatibilist view of free will ( free will and determinism , whether physical or divine , are metaphysically compatible ) . The view of <unk> such as Mackie and Flew is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil . In such a world people could have chosen to only perform good deeds , even though all their choices were predestined . Plantinga dismisses <unk> , according to which a person is free if , and only if she could have done otherwise if she wanted to do otherwise by saying that it is " altogether paradoxical " . He thinks that " this objection ... seems utterly implausible . One might as well claim that being in jail doesn 't really limit one 's freedom on the grounds that if one were not in jail , he 'd be free to come and go as he pleased " . Regarding Flew 's criticism Plantinga concludes that " his objection is in an important sense merely verbal and thus altogether fails to damage the free will defense . " 
 = = = The problem of natural evil = = = 
 Another issue with Plantinga 's defense is that it does not address the problem of natural evil , since natural evil is not brought about by the free choices of creatures . Plantinga 's reply is a suggestion that it is at least logically possible that perhaps free , nonhuman persons are responsible for natural evils ( e.g. rebellious spirits or fallen angels ) . This suggestion assigns the responsibility for natural evils to other moral actors . 
 = = = " Omnipotent God " of Alvin Plantinga has limited power = = = 
 A recent objection to the defense is due to Geirsson and <unk> , who question the interpretation of the fourth assertion in the definition of transworld depravity ( " If S ´ were actual , P would go wrong with respect to A " ) . This is a contingent fact : it is true in the actual world , but false in the world W. So one may ask if this contingent fact was up to God or not . If it was caused to be true by God , one may wonder why God actualized a world in which this person is transworld depraved when God could have actualized a world where this person , at least with respect to this action , would not suffer from such conditional depravity . If on the other hand , the fact is not up to God , we must accept that an omnipotent God has no power over contingent facts about the world ; after all , there do exist possible worlds where the conditional statement in question is not true . Geirsson and <unk> note that Mackie 's reasons for rejecting Plantinga 's defense were quite similar : 
 But how could there be logically contingent states of affairs , prior to the creation and existence of any created beings with free will , which an omnipotent God would have to accept and put up with ? This suggestion is simply incoherent . 
 Despite these objections , many philosophers consider Plantinga 's defense , with its implicit libertarianism , to be a strong reply to the logical problem of evil . However , other philosophers argue that Plantinga 's defense is unsuccessful . 
 = Stig Inge Bjørnebye = 
 Stig Inge Bjørnebye ( born 11 December 1969 ) is a retired Norwegian footballer who played in Norway , England , and Denmark , most notably for Liverpool . His preferred position was left back , which he occupied for domestic clubs and the national team . Bjørnebye was appointed assistant manager of Norway in 2003 , relinquishing the role three years later to succeed Tom Nordlie as manager of IK Start . 
 For club and country , Bjørnebye was noted for his precise deliveries from the flanks . Described as a " solid , no @-@ nonsense full @-@ back " , Bjørnebye played competitive football for 16 years , and appeared in 194 Premier League matches , until injury compelled retirement in March 2003 . He represented the Norwegian national team in the 1994 and 1998 FIFA World Cup and the Euro 2000 and was capped 75 times , scoring once . 
 = = Club career = = 
 Stig Inge Bjørnebye was born in Elverum , the son of skier Jo Inge Bjørnebye , who competed in the 1968 and 1972 Winter Olympics . As a child , Bjørnebye exhibited an interest in emulating his father by becoming a ski jumper . 
 His footballing career began as a youth player with home club Elverum IL , before joining Strømmen IF in the late 1980s . He moved to Kongsvinger IL in 1989 , establishing himself as a first @-@ team regular in the Norwegian Premier League . After three seasons with Kongsvinger , he transferred to Rosenborg in 1992 , where he in his inaugural season won the Norwegian Premier League and Norwegian Cup , in the final of , which he scored the deciding goal against Lillestrøm SK . 
 His performances merited inclusion in the national team and attracted the attention of Liverpool 's manager Graeme Souness , who bought Bjørnebye for £ 600 @,@ 000 less than one year after moving to Rosenborg . Signed as a replacement for David Burrows , Bjørnebye debuted inauspiciously on 19 December 1992 in a 5 – 1 defeat to Coventry City . Initial difficulties adapting to the Premier League caused many fans to question his displays on the pitch and he returned to Norway on loan to Rosenborg in 1994 . 
 Bjørnebye 's experiences as a Reds ' player in the 1994 – 95 season under the management of Roy Evans , were markedly more successful than that of previous campaigns . He gained a regular place in the senior team , supplanting the left back position from Julian Dicks , and featured in the 2 – 1 win against Bolton Wanderers in the final of the 1995 League Cup Final on 2 April 1995 . Subsequent injury , a broken leg sustained on 5 April 1995 in a 3 – 1 win match against Southampton , terminated his season and he was replaced by Steve Harkness . 
 Unavailable for several months , Bjørnebye appeared just twice for Liverpool in the 1995 – 96 season . Recovery and injuries to other left back candidates enabled Bjørnebye to reclaim his place the following season , in which he scored his first goal for Liverpool on 17 August 1996 in a 3 – 3 draw against Middlesbrough . He contributed to the club 's most convincing title challenge since the inception of the Premier League by supplying club strikers Stan Collymore and Robbie Fowler with precise crosses . He was ultimately included in the PFA Team of the Year with Steve McManaman and Mark Wright . The acquisition of Steve Staunton and arrival of Gérard Houllier in the 1998 – 99 season , limited Bjørnebye 's first @-@ team opportunities , leading to his effective marginalisation . Bjørnebye affirmed his recurring determination to stay at Liverpool that season , remarking " If I didn 't have any fight in my stomach I 'd have left Liverpool at least three times before " . 
 Unable to displace Staunton and Dominic Matteo , Bjørnebye agreed to a loan move to Danish side Brøndby IF in 2000 , who finished second in the Danish Superliga with Bjørnebye on the team . He decided to permanently leave Liverpool after returning from the European Championship , accepting a £ 300 @,@ 000 transfer to Blackburn Rovers that reunited him with former manager Graeme Souness . Promotion to the Premier League was achieved in his first year with Rovers , in the process , Bjørnebye scored his only goal for the club on 11 November 2000 , in a 2 – 2 draw against Portsmouth . His final trophy was gained when Blackburn defeated Tottenham Hotspur 2 – 1 in the 2002 League Cup Final . Successive injuries after the cup victory disrupted and eventually ended his career as a footballer . While preparing for the 2002 – 03 season , Bjørnebye fractured his eye socket in a training accident . He complained of double vision , underwent surgery , and was rendered unavailable for seven months . Further injury inflicted during a League Cup match on 17 December 2002 , in a 2 – 0 win against Wigan Athletic escalated , while Bjørnebye was recovering in Norway , necessitating emergency surgery to avert the possibility of foot amputation . Bjørnebye announced his retirement on 11 March 2003 . Blackburn manager Graham Souness reacted to the decision with a statement : 
 It 's a very sad day . As far as I am concerned it could hardly be worse for Stig is the consummate dedicated professional . He is as good a professional as any I have worked with , I couldn ’ t name anybody better and he is [ a ] fine role model and a proper , proper human being . Stig has had a wonderful career , it 's a great shame that it has to end with a freak training @-@ ground accident as he felt , quite rightly , that he could have played longer . 
 = = International career = = 
 Bjørnebye was capped 75 times by Norway , scoring once – an olympic goal in a 1 – 0 friendly against the United States on 8 September 1993 . Having represented his country at youth , under @-@ 21 , and " B " level , Bjørnebye debuted for the senior team on 31 May 1989 against Austria . The majority of his caps were collected during Egil Olsen 's eight @-@ year tenure as manager of Norway . Under Olsen 's guidance , Norway employed a " long ball " policy that was contingent on the height of Olsen 's squad . The tactic of directing long passes to the tall winger Jostein Flo , principally delivered by Bjørnebye , became popularly referred to in Norway as the " Flo Pass " ( Flo @-@ <unk> ) . Although criticised for employing the long @-@ ball approach and maintaining a defensively @-@ orientated mentality , Olsen secured qualification for the World Cups of 1994 and 1998 . Bjørnebye participated in both tournaments – seven matches in total . 
 He decided to retire from international football after the 1998 World Cup , intending to focus on his domestic career and family . Bjørnebye unexpectedly reversed his decision after Nils Johan <unk> persuaded him to return to the squad for Euro 2000 . Unused in Norway 's 1 – 0 win against Spain on 13 June 2000 , Bjørnebye was first introduced to the competition in the second match of the group stage , in a 0 – 1 loss on 18 June 2000 against Yugoslavia , as a 35 @-@ minute substitute for his Liverpool colleague Vegard Heggem . He retained his place , featuring in the goalless draw against Slovenia on 21 June 2000 , which eliminated Norway from the tournament . His final international match was in a 1 – 1 draw World Cup qualifier on 7 October 2000 against Wales , placing him ninth in the overall record of appearances for Norway as of 2007 . 
 = = Managerial career = = 
 Bjørnebye returned to football in a non @-@ playing capacity when he was selected by the Norwegian Football Association to replace Harald <unk> as Norway 's assistant manager , subordinate to the newly appointed Åge Hareide . Prior to the announcement , the media in England had reported that Bjørnebye was considering maintaining a relationship with Blackburn by becoming a scout for the club . He vacated his position in 2006 to succeed Tom Nordlie as manager of IK Start . Success was forthcoming in his first season ; the club competed in Europe and Bjørnebye was declared most profitable coach of the year , ahead of his predecessor Nordlie , with an income of almost seven million krone . His appointment lasted two seasons , ending with dismissal in September 2007 , after a series of poor results that placed the club in serious danger of being relegated from the Norwegian Premier League . He was replaced by Benny <unk> , who was unable to preserve the club 's premier league status ; Start were relegated to Norway 's second tier .

 = Tylopilus felleus = 
 Tylopilus felleus , commonly known as the bitter bolete or the bitter <unk> , is a fungus of the bolete family . Its distribution includes east Asia , Europe , and eastern North America , extending south into Mexico and Central America . A mycorrhizal species , it grows in deciduous and coniferous woodland , often fruiting under beech and oak . Its fruit bodies have convex to flat caps that are some shade of brown , buff , or tan , and typically measure up to 15 cm ( 6 in ) in diameter . The pore surface is initially white before turning pinkish with age . Like most boletes it lacks a ring , and it may be distinguished from Boletus edulis and other similar species by its unusual pink pores and the prominent dark brown netlike pattern on its stalk . 
 French mycologist Pierre Bulliard described this species as Boletus felleus in 1788 before it was transferred into the new genus Tylopilus . It is the type species of Tylopilus , and the only member of the genus found in Europe . Tylopilus felleus has been the subject of research into bioactive compounds that have been tested for antitumour and antibiotic properties . Although not poisonous , it is generally considered inedible , due to its overwhelming bitterness . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described in the scientific literature as le bolet <unk> ( Boletus felleus ) by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1788 . As the large genus Boletus was carved up into smaller genera , Petter Karsten transferred it in 1881 to Tylopilus , a genus diagnosed by its pink spores and adnate tubes . T. felleus is the type species of Tylopilus , and the only member of the genus found in Europe . Synonyms include Boletus <unk> , described by Elias Magnus Fries in 1815 and later by Friedrich Wilhelm Gottlieb <unk> in 1844 , and Paul Christoph Hennings 's subsequent transfer of Fries 's taxon into Tylopilus , T. <unk> . Lucien Quélet placed the taxon in Dictyopus in 1886 and then <unk> in 1888 , but neither of these genera are recognised today , the former having been merged into Boletus and the latter into Tylopilus . Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that T. felleus and many ( but not all ) other members of Tylopilus form a Tylopilus clade within a larger group informally called <unk> in the Boletineae . Other clades in the group include the porcini and Strobilomyces clades , as well as three other groups composed of members of various genera including Xerocomus , Xerocomellus and Boletus badius and relatives . 
 A variety described from the Great Lakes region , var. uliginosus , was recognised by Alexander H. Smith and Harry D. Thiers in 1971 on the basis of its microscopic features , a distinction supported by Professor C.B. Wolfe of Pennsylvania State University . However , Index Fungorum does not consider this an independent taxon . Similarly , Boletus felleus var. minor , published originally by William Chambers Coker and A.H. Beers in 1943 ( later transferred to Tylopilus by Albert Pilát and Aurel Dermek in 1974 ) , has been folded into synonymy with T. felleus . Charles Horton Peck described Boletus felleus var. obesus in 1889 , but no record of a type specimen exists . Although some records exist of T. felleus in Australia , their spores are of consistently smaller dimensions and this taxon has been classified as a separate species , T. <unk> . 
 Tylopilus felleus derives its genus name from the Greek <unk> " bump " and <unk> " hat " , and its specific name from the Latin fel meaning " bile " referring to its bitter taste , similar to bile . The mushroom is commonly known as the " bitter bolete " or the " bitter <unk> " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of this species grows up to 15 cm ( 6 in ) in diameter , though some North American specimens reach 30 cm ( 12 in ) across . Grey @-@ yellow to pale- or walnut @-@ brown , it is slightly downy at first and later becomes smooth with a matte lustre . It is initially convex before flattening out with maturity . The cap skin does not peel away from the flesh . The pores underneath are white at first and become pinkish with maturity . They are adnate to the stalk and bulge downwards as the mushroom ages . The pores bruise carmine or brownish , often developing rusty @-@ brown spots with age , and number about one or two per millimetre . The tubes are long relative to the size of the cap , measuring 2 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) deep in the middle part of the cap . The stalk is initially bulbous before stretching and thinning in the upper part ; the lower part of the stalk remains swollen , sometimes shrinking at the base where it attaches to the substrate . It measures 7 – 10 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) — rarely to 20 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) — tall , and 2 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) wide , and can bulge out to 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) across at the base . It is lighter in colour than the cap , and covered with a coarse brown network of markings , which have been likened to fishnet stockings in appearance . Described as " very appetising " in appearance , the flesh is white or creamy , and pink beneath the cap cuticle ; the flesh can also develop pinkish tones where it has been cut . It has a slight smell , which has been described as pleasant , as well as faintly unpleasant . The flesh is softer than that of other boletes , and tends to become more spongy as the mushroom matures . Insects rarely infest this species . 
 The colour of the spore print is brownish , with pink , reddish , or rosy tints . Spores are somewhat fuse @-@ shaped , smooth , and measure 11 – 17 by 3 – 5 µm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored , and measure 18 – 25 @.@ 6 by 7 @.@ 0 – 10 @.@ 2 µm . Cystidia on the walls of the tubes ( pleurocystidia ) are fuse @-@ shaped with a central swelling , thin @-@ walled , and have granular contents . They possess sharp to tapered tips , and have overall dimensions of 36 – 44 by 8 @.@ 0 – 11 @.@ 0 µm . On the pore edges , the cheilocystidia are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia , measuring 24 @.@ 8 – 44 @.@ 0 by 7 @.@ 3 – 11 @.@ 0 µm . The hymenium of Smith and Thiers 's variety uliginosus , when mounted in Melzer 's reagent , shows reddish globules of pigment measuring 2 – 8 µm that appear in the hyphae and throughout the hymenium , and a large ( 8 – 12 µm ) globule in the pleurocystidia . 
 Several chemical tests have been documented that can help confirm the identify of this species . On the cap flesh , application of formaldehyde turns the tissue pinkish , iron salts result in a colour change to greyish @-@ green , aniline causes a lavender to reddish @-@ brown colour , and phenol a purplish pink to reddish brown . On the cap cuticle , nitric acid causes an orange @-@ salmon colour , sulphuric acid creates orange @-@ red , ammonia usually makes brown , and a potassium hydroxide solution usually makes orange . 
 = = Similar species = = 
 Italian cook and author Antonio Carluccio reports this is one of the most common fungi brought to him to identify , having been mistaken for an edible species . Young specimens can be confused with many edible boletes , though as the pores become more pink the species becomes easier to identify . Some guidebooks advocate tasting the flesh , the smallest piece of which will be very bitter . The dark @-@ on @-@ light reticulation in the stalk is distinctive , and is the opposite colouration of that on the stalk of the prized Boletus edulis . T. felleus is found in the same habitat as B. badius , though the latter 's yellow tubes and blue @-@ bruising flesh easily distinguish it . B. <unk> can have a similar @-@ coloured cap , but its yellow pores and slender stalk aid identification . 
 Tylopilus <unk> , found in hardwood forests of eastern North America , is similar in appearance to T. felleus , but has a purplish to purple @-@ brown cap . It is also inedible due to its bitter taste . Another North American species , T. <unk> , has a cap that is reddish @-@ brown to chestnut @-@ brown , with olive tones in youth . It has shorter spores than T. felleus , typically measuring 9 – 13 by 3 – 4 @.@ 5 μm . In the field , it can be distinguished from the latter species by its mild to slightly bitter taste . T. <unk> , found in the southeastern United States , has a lighter @-@ coloured cap that is smaller , up to 9 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) in diameter . The edible T. <unk> and T. ferrugineus can be confused with T. felleus , but have less reticulated stalks . The dimensions of the spores of the Australian species T. <unk> range from 9 @.@ 2 to 10 @.@ 5 by 3 @.@ 5 to 3 @.@ 9 μm . T. <unk> , limited in distribution to deciduous forests of China , New Guinea , Japan , and Taiwan , can be distinguished from T. felleus macroscopically by its vinaceous @-@ brown cap and pinkish @-@ brown to vinaceous stalk , and microscopically by its smaller spores ( measuring 11 – 14 by 4 – 5 μm ) and longer pleurocystidia ( 49 – 107 by 14 – 24 μm ) . 
 = = Ecology , distribution and habitat = = 
 Like all Tylopilus species , T. felleus is mycorrhizal . It is found in deciduous and coniferous woodland , often under beech and oak in well @-@ drained acid soils , which can be sandy , gravelly or peaty . If encountered on calcareous ( chalky ) soil , it will be in moist areas that have become waterlogged and have ample leaf litter . Fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups , and occasionally in small clusters with two or three joined at the base of the stem . Fruit bodies have also been growing in the cavities of old trees , on old conifer stumps , or on buried rotten wood . The fungus obtains most of its nitrogen requirements from amino acids derived from the breakdown of proteins , although a lesser amount is obtained from the amino sugar glucosamine ( a breakdown product of chitin , a major component of fungal cell walls ) . The mycorrhizal plant partner benefits from the fungus 's ability to use these forms of nitrogen , which are often abundant in the forest floor . Fruit bodies appear over summer and autumn , anytime from June to October or even November , in many of the northern temperate zones . Large numbers may appear in some years , and none in others , generally proportional to the amount of rainfall . Variety uliginosus , known from Michigan , grows among lichens and mosses under pines . 
 In North America , it is known from eastern Canada , south to Florida and west to Minnesota in the United States , and into Mexico and Central America . Its European distribution is widespread ; it is relatively common in many regions , but rare or almost absent in others . In Asia , it has been recorded from the vicinity of <unk> in the Astore District of northern Pakistan , and as far east as China , where it has been recorded from Hebei , Jiangsu , Fujian , Guangdong and Sichuan provinces , and Korea . 
 The strong taste of the fruit body may have some role in insects avoiding it . The small fly species Megaselia pygmaeoides feeds on and infests the fruit bodies of T. felleus in North America , though it seems to prefer other boletes in Europe . Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the mould Sepedonium ampullosporum . Infection results in necrosis of the mushroom tissue , and a yellow colour caused by the formation of large amounts of pigmented aleurioconidia ( single @-@ celled conidia produced by extrusion from the conidiophores ) . 
 The bacterium <unk> <unk> has been isolated from the mycorrhizosphere of T. felleus ; this is the region around its subterranean hyphae where nutrients released from the fungus affect the activity of the microbial population in the soil . The bacterium excretes enzymes that allow it to break down the biomolecule chitin . 
 Fruit bodies of T. felleus have a high capacity to accumulate radioactive caesium ( 137Cs ) from contaminated soil , a characteristic attributed to the deep soil penetration achieved by the mycelium . In contrast , the species has a limited capacity to accumulate the radioactive isotope 210Po . 
 = = Edibility = = 
 As its common name suggests , it is extremely bitter , though not toxic as such . This bitterness is worsened by cooking . One specimen can foul the taste of a whole meal prepared with mushrooms . Despite this , it is sold in local markets ( <unk> ) in Mexico . A local recipe from France , Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in skimmed milk after which it can be eaten , or powdered and used for flavouring . The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter taste , a trait endowed by the gene <unk> ( taste receptor 2 member 38 ) . The compound responsible for the bitter taste has not been identified . 
 = = Research = = 
 The mycelium of Tylopilus felleus can be grown in axenic culture , on agar containing growth medium . The fungus can form fruit bodies if the temperature is suitable , and the light conditions simulate a 12 @-@ hour day . The mushrooms are usually deformed , often lacking stalks so that the cap grows directly on the surface , and the caps are usually 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 0 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter . There are few Boletaceae species known to fruit in culture , as ectomycorrhizal fungi tend to not fruit when separated from their host plant . 
 Compounds from T. felleus have been extracted and researched for potential medical uses . <unk> is a beta @-@ glucan that was isolated from the fruit bodies in 1988 and shown in laboratory tests to have cytotoxic properties and to stimulate non @-@ specific immunological response . In particular , it enhances phagocytosis , the process by which macrophages and granulocytes engulf and digest foreign bacteria . In experiments on mice with tumour cells , it appeared to have antitumour effects when administered in combination with a preparation of Propionibacterium acnes in a 1994 Polish study . Researchers in 2004 reported that extracts of the fruit body inhibit the enzyme pancreatic lipase ; it was the second most inhibitory of 100 mushrooms they tested . A compound present in the mushroom , N @-@ γ @-@ glutamyl <unk> , has mild antibacterial activity .

 Ernest ' Melville ' Guest was born in Salisbury , Southern Rhodesia , in May 1920 , one of the twin sons of Ernest Lucas Guest , a prominent Rhodesian politician . Before the outbreak of the Second World War , he was nominated by the Governor of Southern Rhodesia to be a Royal Air Force cadet at RAF College , Cranwell . He was granted a permanent commission as Pilot Officer in the General Duties Branch on 9 October 1939 . 
 = = Career = = 
 Shortly after he passed out of Cranwell , he returned home on leave to attend the wedding of his elder sister , Gwen , and a telegram addressed to him was included by mistake in the congratulatory telegrams read out at the reception . It read : " Return to England immediately and report to Air Ministry " . He was posted to No. 206 Squadron RAF and flew a number of sorties over enemy territory . When Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands , along with Crown Princess Juliana and other members of the Dutch Royal Family fled to England in May 1940 aboard the British destroyer HMS Hereward , Guest was in the air escort that accompanied her to safety . 
 He was promoted to Flying Officer on 9 October 1940 and then Flight Lieutenant on 9 October 1941 . 
 In the meantime , he was posted to the Gambia in June 1941 with No. 200 Squadron RAF , which was formed from a section of No. 206 Squadron . Later , he transferred to 61 Air School at George , Cape Province , South Africa , as a navigation instructor . He was unhappy at George and soon sought to return to operational duty . 
 Guest returned to England and joined No. 53 Squadron RAF in 1943 , flying B @-@ 24 Liberator bombers from RAF Thorney Island on anti @-@ submarine patrols over the Bay of Biscay . Soon after arriving in England , on 4 October 1943 , his and another aircraft were sent out on patrol . They were attacked by six Ju 88s . The other aircraft sought the protection of the clouds but Guest decided to fight it out . He did not return . He was pronounced missing in January 1944 .

 = USS West Apaum ( ID @-@ 3221 ) = 
 USS West Apaum ( ID @-@ 3221 ) was a cargo ship in the United States Navy during World War I. She had been built as SS West Apaum for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) as part of the West boats , a series of steel @-@ hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States . 
 West Apaum sailed on three voyages for the US Navy , two after the Armistice , before she was decommissioned in July 1919 . Though little is available regarding West Apaum 's civilian career , it is known that she was sailing on a New York – Rotterdam route in early 1927 . By early 1929 , West Apaum had been laid up by the USSB , which abandoned her in 1933 . The cargo ship was scrapped in the second quarter of that same year . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 The West ships were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States for the United States Shipping Board for emergency use during World War I. All were given names that began with the word West , like West Apaum , one of some 24 West ships built by Skinner & Eddy of Seattle , Washington . 
 West Apaum ( Skinner & Eddy No. 23 , USSB No. 88 ) was laid down on 19 March 1918 , launched on 23 May , and delivered to the Navy upon completion on 19 June . West Apaum was built in a total of 78 working days , 92 calendar days , and was tied with three other ships for tenth place on a list of the ten fastest constructed ocean @-@ going vessels compiled in 1920 . Skinner & Eddy received a $ 25 @,@ 000 bonus for completing the ship early . 
 The ship was 5 @,@ 537 gross register tons ( GRT ) , and was 409 feet 5 inches ( 124 @.@ 79 m ) long ( between perpendiculars ) and 54 feet ( 16 @.@ 5 m ) abeam . West Apaum had a steel hull and a mean draft of 22 feet 2 @.@ 25 inches ( 6 @.@ <unk> m ) . She displaced 12 @,@ 226 t , and had a deadweight tonnage of 8 @,@ 800 DWT . The ship had a single triple @-@ expansion steam engine powered by three coal @-@ fired boilers that drove her single screw propeller , and moved the ship at a 10 @.@ 5 @-@ knot ( 19 @.@ 4 km / h ) pace . 
 = = Military career = = 
 USS West Apaum ( ID @-@ 3221 ) was commissioned into the Naval Overseas Transportation Service ( NOTS ) on 20 June 1918 with Lieutenant Commander J. S. Gibson , USNRF , in command . 
 West Apaum departed Bremerton , Washington , on 27 June for Arica , Chile , to take on a cargo of nitrates for the United States . Sailing from there via the Panama Canal , West Apaum arrived at Savannah , Georgia , on 9 September . From there she sailed for Hampton Roads , Virginia , where she arrived on 10 October . Eight days later , loaded with rolling stock , steel rails , and other general cargo for the United States Army , the cargo ship sailed for France . Delayed at Halifax for repairs to her damaged propeller , West Apaum finally entered the harbor at La Pallice on 22 November , 11 days after the Armistice . 
 West Apaum unloaded her railroad goods , loaded 2 @,@ 214 long tons ( 2 @,@ 250 t ) of Army cargo , and headed for the United States on 13 December . She arrived at Hampton Roads on 3 January 1919 . West Apaum made two more voyages to France under Navy control . On her final voyage , she carried airplane materials to France and returned 5 @,@ 000 long tons ( 5 @,@ 100 t ) of Army ordnance to New York on 11 July . On 25 July , West Apaum was decommissioned and returned to the USSB . 
 = = Civilian career = = 
 Little is known about West Apaum 's subsequent civilian career . In the first quarter of 1927 , it is known that West Apaum was sailing on a New York – Rotterdam route . While in this service , The New York Times , in one of just a few mentions the ship received in contemporary news coverage , reported on the transfer of one of West Apaum 's crew members to the United States Lines ocean liner Republic at sea . The crewman had fallen into an open hatchway and had fractured his skull . The two ships , located some 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ; 230 mi ) west of New York , came within 1 ⁄ 4 mile ( 0 @.@ 40 km ) of each other and the injured man was loaded on to a boat from Republic in the heavy seas . The crewman , though successfully transferred to Republic , died several hours later . 
 By early 1929 , West Apaum had been laid up , and was under consideration by the USSB for the installation of pulverized coal @-@ fired boilers for testing purposes , but lost out on the honor to West Alsek . No further information on West Apaum 's career is available , but it is known that she was abandoned by the USSB in 1933 , and scrapped in the second quarter of that year . 
 = The Simpsons Spin @-@ Off Showcase = 
 " The Simpsons Spin @-@ Off Showcase " is the twenty @-@ fourth episode of the eighth season of The Simpsons . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 11 , 1997 . The episode centers on fictional pilot episodes of non @-@ existent television series derived from The Simpsons , and is a parody of the tendency of networks to spin off characters from a hit series . As such it includes references to many different TV series . The first fictional spin @-@ off is Chief Wiggum P.I. , a cop @-@ drama featuring Chief Wiggum and Seymour Skinner . The second is The Love @-@ matic Grampa , a sitcom featuring Moe Szyslak who receives dating advice from Abraham Simpson , whose ghost is possessing a love testing machine . The final segment is The Simpson Family Smile @-@ Time Variety Hour , a variety show featuring the Simpson family except for Lisa , who has been replaced . 
 The episode was written by David S. Cohen , Dan Greaney and Steve Tompkins , with Ken Keeler coming up with the story and the general idea of intentionally bad writing . It was directed by Neil Affleck , and Tim Conway , <unk> Sartain and Phil Hartman guest @-@ starred . The producers were initially uneasy about the episode , as they feared that the purposely bad writing would pass off as actual bad writing . The episode , however , now figures on several lists of the most popular Simpsons episodes . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Troy McClure hosts a television special from the museum of TV and television introducing three spin @-@ off productions , created using characters from The Simpsons . The Fox network only has three filled slots for the next season and so commissions the producers of The Simpsons to create thirty @-@ five new shows . The producers instead decided to create just three new shows . 
 Chief Wiggum , P.I. is a cop @-@ drama spin @-@ off and a parody of Magnum , P.I. , which follows Chief Wiggum , Ralph and Seymour Skinner . Chief Wiggum and his son Ralph move to New Orleans with Seymour Skinner as Wiggum 's sidekick . Wiggum has proclaimed that he will " clean up the city " of New Orleans , but it does not take long before he meets his nemesis , Big Daddy , who warns Wiggum to stay out of his business . Soon after , Ralph disappears and Wiggum finds Big Daddy 's calling card left behind . Wiggum manages to track Big Daddy 's ransom call to the Mardi Gras , where he briefly runs into the Simpson family , and the two chase each other to Big Daddy 's mansion in the New <unk> bayou ( in reality the Louisiana governor 's mansion which Big Daddy has managed to steal ) . Chief Wiggum then threatens Big Daddy with a gun , but Big Daddy counters by tossing Ralph at his father , then jumping out the window and swimming away ( at an extremely slow speed , due to his weight ) . Wiggum ultimately lets the villain escape , feeling that he will meet him again " each and every week , always in more sexy and exciting ways " . 
 The Love @-@ matic Grampa is a sitcom @-@ style television series about Moe 's love life . He receives advice from the ghost of Abraham Simpson , who was crushed by a store shelf containing cans of figs that toppled on him and subsequently " while travelling up toward Heaven ... got lost along the way " and now possesses Moe 's love tester machine . Moe ends up getting a date he meets at the bar . On Grampa 's advice he takes his date out to a French restaurant and hides the Love Tester in the bathroom so he can get advice while at the restaurant . After Kearney , Dolph and Jimbo whack the machine because it said they were gay , it malfunctions and advises Moe to tell his date that " her rump 's as big as the Queen 's , and twice as fragrant " . Moe returns with a bowl of snails dumped on his head and his dependence on the machine is revealed , so he confesses to receiving advice . His date is actually happy when she hears this , flattered that Moe would go to all that trouble for her . Grampa asks to be introduced to an attractive payphone in front of the restaurant , much to the mirth of Moe and his date . 
 The Simpson Family Smile @-@ Time Variety Hour is a comedy show featuring various songs and sketches in a parody of The Brady Bunch Hour . It features Homer , Marge , Bart , and Maggie . Lisa refuses to participate , but is replaced by an attractive blonde bombshell ( voiced by Pamela Hayden ) . After the introduction there is a sketch , where the family are portrayed as beavers living in a dam with Tim Conway as a skunk and Homer 's boss . The show ends with a medley of songs sung by the family , Jasper Beardley and Waylon Smithers . 
 Troy ends the special with a look at the upcoming season of The Simpsons , filled with ridiculous plot twists , such as Homer turning Lisa into a frog using magic powers , the discovery of Bart 's two long lost identical brothers ( one African American , the other a cowboy ) , Selma marrying Lenny , Bumblebee Man , and Itchy ( in succession ) , and Homer meeting an alien named Ozmodiar whom only he can see . 
 = = Production = = 
 Ken Keeler came up with the idea for the episode from the one sentence statement : " Let 's do spin @-@ offs " . His idea was to use intentionally bad writing and " crazy plots " , which underlines their critique of spin @-@ offs in general . After he had pitched the idea it was decided that " it was an idea that ought to work pretty well " and production went ahead . Creator Matt Groening was uneasy about the idea , feeling that it could be mistranslated as actually bad sitcom writing . He also did not like the idea of breaking the fourth wall and the concept of saying that the Simpsons were just actors in a television show . The idea was later explored in the season 11 episode " Behind the Laughter " . One of the " crazy " ideas was the inclusion of the character of Ozmodiar , who was originally included in the script for an earlier episode but was considered too ridiculous for the time . When this episode came along the character seemed to fit with the story and was included . Even though Keeler came up with the story , David S. Cohen , Dan Greaney and Steve Tompkins wrote the scripts for the three segments . Cohen wrote Chief Wiggum P.I. , Greaney wrote Love @-@ matic Grampa and Tompkins wrote The Simpson Family Smile @-@ Time Variety Hour . 
 The episode demanded a different approach to directing than a usual The Simpsons episode . Director Neil Affleck had to animate each segment so that it fit the style of the show it parodied . The Love @-@ matic Grampa segment for instance emulates a three camera setup , as is normally used in sitcoms . 
 Three guest stars appear in the episode ; Phil Hartman as Troy McClure , Tim Conway as himself and <unk> Sartain as Big Daddy . McClure is used as a host of the episode , something he had previously done in the episode " The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular " . Conway appears as himself . Conway , a comic veteran , is known for his work on The Carol Burnett Show , which has a similar format to The Simpson Family Smile @-@ Time Variety Hour . Due to Lisa being substituted for an older teenager in the third segment , Yeardley Smith only has one line in the entire episode . 
 = = = Proposed real spin @-@ offs = = = 
 Over the course of the show , the staff have considered producing several spin @-@ off television series and films , based on The Simpsons . In 1994 , Matt Groening pitched a live action spin @-@ off from The Simpsons that centered on Krusty and would star Dan Castellaneta . He and Michael <unk> wrote a pilot script where Krusty moved to Los Angeles and got his own talk show . A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty lived in a house on wooden stilts which were continuously being gnawed by beavers . Eventually , the contract negotiations fell apart and Groening decided to stop work on the project . 
 " 22 Short Films About Springfield " sparked the idea amongst the staff for a spin @-@ off series entitled Tales from Springfield . The proposed show would focus on the town in general , rather than the Simpson family . Every week would be a different scenario : three short stories , an adventure with young Homer or a story about a background character that was not tied in to the Simpson family at all . The idea never came to anything , as Groening realized that the staff did not have the manpower to produce another show as well as The Simpsons . The staff believe it is something that they would still be interested in doing , and that " could happen someday . " 
 Groening also expressed a wish to make Simpstasia , a parody of Fantasia ; it was never produced , partly because it would have been too difficult to write a feature @-@ length script . Before his death , Phil Hartman had said he had wished to make a live action Troy McClure film , and several of the show 's staff had expressed a desire to help create it . Matt Groening later told Empire that the idea never " got further than enthusiasm " , but " would have been really fun " . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The whole episode is a satire of unoriginal , poor television writing and references and parodies many television series . When Troy McClure mentions that Fox can only fill up three slots for the next season , the three series are Melrose Place , The X @-@ Files and The Simpsons itself . On the museum of television Troy walks by posters of spin @-@ offs , such as The Ropers ( spun off from Three 's Company ) , Laverne & Shirley ( spun off from Happy Days ) , Rhoda , a show that Julie Kavner , the voice of Marge , once starred in , ( spun off from The Mary Tyler Moore Show ) and Fish ( spun off from Barney Miller ) , to demonstrate the power of spin @-@ offs . Troy walks by a poster of The Jeffersons ( a spin @-@ off of All in the Family ) twice , because the writers could not think of any more spin @-@ offs . 
 Chief Wiggum , P.I. is a parody of police @-@ dramas , such as Miami Vice , Magnum , P.I. and Starsky and Hutch . Skinner emulates Don Johnson from Miami Vice in order to look scruffier . The character of Big Daddy is based on Dr. John , who comes from New Orleans . The chef in the restaurant resembles Paul Prudhomme . 
 The Love @-@ matic Grampa is a parody of fantasy sitcoms such as Mister Ed , I Dream of Jeannie and Bewitched as well as having similarities to My Mother the Car . The Love @-@ matic Grampa machine singing " Daisy Bell " in a distorted manner when its electrical circuits are failing is a reference to HAL from the 1968 film 2001 : A Space Odyssey . Grampa also references All Quiet on the Western Front , when Moe says he " wrote the book on love " . Moe 's date , Betty , looks somewhat like Tress MacNeille , the actress who voiced her . 
 The Simpson Family Smile @-@ Time Variety Hour is a parody of the 1960s and 1970s live variety shows . Mainly it is a parody of The Brady Bunch Hour , a short @-@ lived spin @-@ off of the 1970s sitcom The Brady Bunch . The replacement of Lisa in the third segment with another girl reflects the recasting of Jan Brady in the Brady Bunch Hour when Eve Plumb refused to participate . The Simpson family is made to look like The Partridge Family . Also , the segment holds numerous references to Laugh @-@ In . Kent Brockman introduces the show from inside a broadcast booth in a style similar to Laugh @-@ In , there is a joke wall similar to the one in Laugh @-@ In where The Sea Captain opens a porthole . There is also a Laugh @-@ In @-@ like montage wherein other characters comment on the skit itself . When Hans Moleman reads a poem , it is based on Henry Gibson reading a poem on Laugh @-@ In . Other shows parodied during the variety show include The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour , and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour . 
 The songs parodied during the third segment are : 
 " I Want Candy " by The <unk> , performed by the Simpson family . 
 " Peppermint Twist " by Joey Dee and the <unk> , performed by Bart , Lisa and Maggie . 
 " Lollipop " by Ronald & Ruby , performed by Jasper Beardley . 
 " Whip It " by Devo , performed by Waylon Smithers . 
 In the planned future for the show , Homer meets a green space alien named Ozmodiar that only he can see . This is a reference to The Great <unk> , a character added into some of the final episodes of The Flintstones .

 The writers later noted that the episode divided fans . Essentially , those who loved it were those who realised that the writing was deliberately bad as a way of parodying bad writing , while others who did not appreciate this distinction were less enthusiastic . Matt Groening feared that the fans would interpret the episode in a negative light and was uneasy about the episode when it was in production . He later went on to say that the episode " turned out great " . The writers of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood called it , " A very clever spin on the alternates offered by the Treehouse of Horrors run . Each of the spin @-@ offs is very clever in its own way . " It has also figured as one of the favorite episodes on a number of " best of " lists . Entertainment Weekly placed the episode 19th in their top 25 Simpsons episode list . In an interview for Star @-@ News , The Simpsons writer Don Payne revealed that the episode was in his personal top six of the best The Simpsons episodes . Additionally , Gary <unk> , a staff writer for The News Journal , picked the episode as part of his top @-@ ten list . 
 = Star Trek : The Next Generation ( season 3 ) = 
 The third season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : The Next Generation commenced airing in broadcast syndication in the United States on September 25 , 1989 and concluded on June 18 , 1990 after airing 26 episodes . Set in the 24th century , the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Starfleet starship Enterprise @-@ D. Season three featured the return of Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher after she was replaced by Diana Muldaur for the second season . The season also saw the debut of several actors who would reappear in the same roles and others throughout the franchise , such as Dwight Schultz as Lt. Reginald Barclay , and Tony Todd as <unk> . 
 Further changes occurred to the writing staff , with Michael Piller brought on board as executive producer after Michael I. Wagner held the position for three weeks . Ronald D. Moore also joined the staff following the submission of a script for " The Bonding " . Hans Beimler , Richard Manning , Melinda M. Snodgrass and Ira Steven Behr all left the staff at the end of the season . Actor Wil Wheaton also asked to leave following the way his character , Wesley Crusher , was written during the season , a decision he later regretted . Other changes included a modification to the opening sequence , and changes to the Starfleet uniforms on the show , which resulted in the creation of Patrick Stewart 's " Picard Maneuver " . 
 The season opened with Nielsen ratings of 10 @.@ 8 for " Evolution " with the highest rated episode being " Yesterday 's Enterprise " which scored 11 @.@ 9 . This was the highest rating received since the sixth episode of the first season . The lowest rating of the season was received by the 23rd episode , " Ménage à Troi " , which was given a score of 9 @.@ 1 . After a couple of initial ranking decreases , the episodes in the second half of the season rose back to third place in its timeslot . The season was well received by critics , who called it one of the best of the series . Particular praise was given to several episodes including " Yesterday 's Enterprise " , " Sins of the Father " and the first part of " The Best of Both Worlds " . Box sets of the season have been released both on DVD and Blu @-@ ray , and " The Best of Both Worlds " was given a limited theatrical release .

 Senior writer Maurice Hurley left at the end of season two , and Michael I. Wagner was brought onto the show by executive producer Rick Berman . Wagner 's tenure was brief , lasting three weeks , and he recommended Michael Piller to replace him . Wagner and Piller had previously worked together on the 1988 American television series Probe . Piller 's agent had advised him not to join Star Trek as he would be " pigeon @-@ holed as a freelance writer " , but he ignored the advice . He would also look at leaving at the end of the season , but stayed after Berman and show creator Gene Roddenberry convinced him . Piller wrote the episode that opened the season , " Evolution " and took over as executive producer from " The Bonding " onwards . He explained to the writing staff that there was two requirements for every episode , saying that " every episode is going to be about a character 's growth . And every episode has to be about something . " 
 The season also saw internal promotions to the existing writing staff . Both Hans Beimler and Richard Manning became co @-@ producers , while Melinda M. Snodgrass became an executive script consultant . Following " The Vengeance Factor " , Ira Steven Behr joined the crew as a writing producer . All four writers left the series at the end of the season . Behr would go on to become executive producer for Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . Richard Danus also acted as executive story editor between " Booby Trap " through to " Yesterday 's Enterprise " . Because of the open door policy on spec scripts Piller employed , the season saw the first script for Ronald D. Moore with " The Bonding " . Because of his success with that script , he was subsequently hired as executive story editor from " Sins of the Father " onwards . 
 Because of the way his character was written during season three , Wesley Crusher actor Wil Wheaton asked to be written out of the series . It was a decision he later regretted , as he realised that all the main cast outside of Picard , Riker and Data had similar roles at the time . He praised the writing of Moore in " The Bonding " and Piller in " Evolution " , and said that " Yesterday 's Enterprise " was one of his favourite episodes . The season also saw a relaxation in Gene Roddenberry 's previous direction that The Next Generation could not touch on aspects of The Original Series . This was seen in the episode " Sarek " , but was specifically related to the end of the episode where Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard mentions Spock during a mind meld with Sarek . Piller described this one act as " the breakthrough which allowed us to open the doors , that allowed us to begin to embrace our past . "

 Gates McFadden returned to the role of Doctor Beverly Crusher in the third season , the character had been written out for season two and replaced with Diana Muldaur playing Doctor Katherine Pulaski . Roddenberry had ensured that Crusher was not written out permanently to allow for her return in the future . Keith DeCandido blamed her departure on Maurice Hurley . After he left the series , McFadden returned . Fans started a letter @-@ writing campaign to reinstate McFadden throughout the second season . Both Roddenberry and Berman decided that it would be better to bring back McFadden than to look for a third doctor in three years as they agreed that the Pulaski character was not working . 
 Season three saw further appearances for several recurring characters from the franchise , including John de Lancie as Q in " Déjà Q " , Majel Barrett as Lwaxana Troi in " Ménage à Troi " , who had both appeared in multiple episodes of previous seasons . It also featured an appearance by Mark Lenard as Sarek . Lenard had previously appeared in this role in the Star Trek : The Original Series episode " Journey to Babel " as well as the film franchise . Denise Crosby , whose character Tasha Yar was killed in the first season episode " Skin of Evil " , returned in " Yesterday 's Enterprise " due to changes to the timeline seen in the series . The events of that episode would set up appearances in The Next Generation for the actress as the half @-@ Romulan character Sela in later seasons . 
 The season also featured the first appearance of actors who would later reappear both in The Next Generation and later series of the franchise . These included Tony Todd as Worf 's brother <unk> , who would appear in this role later in the series and also in Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . " Hollow Pursuits " marked the first appearance of Dwight Schultz as Lt. Reginald Barclay in the franchise . He would become a recurring character in the series , and go on to appear in several episodes of Star Trek : Voyager and the film Star Trek : First Contact ( 1996 ) . Schultz had previously been known for his role as Murdock in the television series The A @-@ Team . 
 Susan Gibney appeared as Dr. Leah Brahms in " Booby Trap " , and would later return in that role in " Galaxy 's Child " . Gibney was also considered for the role of the Captain Janeway in Voyager and played Captain Erika <unk> in the Deep Space Nine episode " Paradise Lost " . An actor who later gained a recurring role in Deep Space Nine following an appearance the third season of The Next Generation was Max Grodénchik . He appeared as the Ferengi <unk> in " Captain 's Holiday " , and as another Ferengi in the fifth season 's " The Perfect Mate " . In DS9 , he was initially cast as a " Ferengi Pit Boss " in the pilot episode , " Emissary " . That character would soon become Rom , who by the end of the series was the leader of his race . Jennifer Hetrick also made her first appearance in " Captain 's Holiday " as Vash . She would also appear as that character in " Qpid " and Deep Space Nine 's " Q @-@ Less " . 
 Andreas Katsulas made his first appearances as the Romulan <unk> in " The Enemy " and " The Defector . He would later reappear in episodes of later seasons , in both " Future Imperfect " and the series finale " All Good Things ... " . Charles Cooper and Patrick <unk> appeared as K <unk> and Duras respectively in " Sins of the Father " , and would also appear in those roles once more in " Reunion " in the fourth season . A number of other actors also appeared during the season in prominent guest star roles , including Saul <unk> , Tricia O 'Neil , Harry Groener and James Sloyan . Groener returned to Star Trek during the final season of Star Trek : Enterprise in a different role during the episodes " Demons " and " Terra Prime " .

 Robert Blackman joined the crew prior to the start of the season as costume designer . He had been recommended by his predecessor , <unk> Rice Wood . He later recalled that he wasn 't interested in the job and only took the interview as a favor , but he was so struck by producer David Livingston 's enthusiasm that he accepted the post . One of his tasks was to redesign the Starfleet costumes which had been used for the first two seasons . The previous versions were made of spandex and caused back problems in the cast . The new costumes cost $ 3 @,@ 000 , and were made out of a wool gabardine . 
 With Roddenberry 's permission , Blackman changed the primary color on the uniforms to black with only blocks of red , gold or blue to signify the branch . This change was intended to set off the faces of the cast and to smooth out their figures on screen . While the men 's costumes became two piece outfits , the costumes for McFadden and Marina Sirtis remained as jumpsuits requiring them to maintain a specific weight each . It was following the introduction of these costumes that the nickname of the " Picard Maneuver " was given to Patrick Stewart 's habit of tugging down his uniform tunic . Blackman also overhauled the Starfleet Admiral 's uniforms , and worked on a variety of alien costumes including designed Klingon and Vulcan outfits . 
 Associate producer Peter Lauritson was promoted to co @-@ producer and both Michael Okuda and Rick Sternbach were credited with the addition title of technical consultant due the level of technical help they had been giving the writers since the start of the series . The opening sequence of the series was changed from the third season onwards . Instead of showing the Enterprise exiting the Solar System as in the first two seasons , it now showed the vessel coming in from the Milky Way .

 Keith DeCandido for Tor.com thought that the third season was where the series " really came into its own " . He praised the changes to the show , such as the modification to the uniforms , and especially the new writing staff that joined the crew during the third season . He said that some of the episodes were highlights of the franchise , not just The Next Generation . Those episodes praised were " Sins of the Father " , " Yesterday 's Enterprise " and the first episode of " The Best of Both Worlds " . He particularly thought that the season finale had never been matched in the entire franchise . He summed up the season by saying that it had " solidified TNG as a show that had finally outgrown the shadow of its predecessor and could stand on its own as a truly fine television show . " 
 Michael Simpson in his review of the Blu @-@ ray release for SciFiNow magazine said that season three was where the series " found its feet " .

He also said that it was the most consistent and memorable season of the series , and several episodes were an " object lesson in clever , suspenseful plotting " . Richard Edwards in his review for SFX magazine , said that it was in the third season that the " chemistry really clicked " between the main cast . He compared it to The Original Series , saying that in this season the show started " to vie with Kirk and co for the mantle of Trek 's definitive incarnation " . He too praised " Yesterday 's Enterprise " , " Sins of the Father " and " Best of Both Worlds " , calling the latter the show 's greatest story . In Jeremy Conrad 's review of season three for IGN , he said that " Yesterday 's Enterprise " and the first part of " Best of Both Worlds " lifted the season and " define [ d ] it as the best of all seven years " .

 = What Were You Hoping For ? = 
 What Were You Hoping For ? is the third studio album by American recording artist Van Hunt , released September 27 , 2011 , on his independent label Godless Hotspot in a joint venture with distributor Thirty Tigers . It is the follow @-@ up to Hunt 's 2006 album On the Jungle Floor and follows a period of label conflict and mainstream obscurity for Hunt . Recording sessions for the album took place primarily at Santa Fe Tracking Station in Los Angeles , where Hunt applied a minimalist recording approach and worked with a backing band comprising drummer Ruth Price , percussionist Melissa Mattey , and keyboardist Peter Dyer . 
 Written and produced by Hunt , What Were You Hoping For ? expands on his previous work 's blend of R & B and rock music forms . Hunt sought to achieve a rawer musical aesthetic and incorporated rough rhythms , rock dynamics , and studio effects . Inspired by Hunt 's experience in Los Angeles at the onset of the late @-@ 2000s recession , the album 's subject matter deals with issues in contemporary society and dissonance in modern life . Music writers have noted the album for its predominantly rock style , incorporation of funk and soul , eccentric songs , varying musical structure , and Hunt 's eclectic vocal range . 
 Upon its release , What Were You Hoping For ? received rave reviews from music critics , who praised its musical direction , Hunt 's performance , and his songwriting . However , it received some backlash from Hunt 's fanbase for its stylistic departure from his past work . The album produced one single , " Eyes Like Pearls " , and performed modestly on music charts , reaching number 50 on the Billboard Top R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Albums . Hunt promoted What You Were Hoping For ? with a national tour that spanned September to October 2011 , and featured session band members Ruth Price and Peter Dyer . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 2006 , Hunt released his second album On the Jungle Floor to critical success , but little commercial notice , despite a costly marketing campaign by his label Capitol Records . After corporate restructuring by Capitol 's parent label EMI , his contract was taken over by another EMI label , Blue Note Records . Hunt subsequently went to work on his first project for Blue Note , entitled Popular . Characterized by him as " an edgy , funk kind of rock record " , Hunt approached the album with a more aggressive , rock @-@ inspired direction , with music that was less conventional than on his previous albums . Upon the album 's completion in 2007 , Hunt decided to relocate from his native Atlanta , Georgia to Los Angeles , California in order to advance his career in the music industry , as well as pursue a relationship there with a woman . 
 Scheduled for a January 2008 release , Popular was promoted with five months of concert performances by Hunt , press coverage , and the release of promotional copies , including the four @-@ song EP The Popular Machine ( 2007 ) and advance CDs for the media and radio people . However , weeks before its scheduled release , the album was shelved by Blue Note , with whom Hunt had been experiencing differences , and they subsequently parted ways . Blue Note had felt that the album was not profitable enough to release . Hunt could not release Popular himself without repaying the project 's costs back to EMI and obtaining rights to the album 's master recordings . According to him , EMI requested twice the original costs , and in his opinion , the money for promoting Popular was not " strategically spent well " by the label . Hunt discussed the situation in an interview for Creative Loafing , saying that " They opted to not sell it to me at a price that I could afford . They 've got it and I 'm sure they 'll come out with it when they deem it necessary and profitable . " Of his decision to relocate to Los Angeles , he later quipped , " Here I am , and the relationship has done much better than the career . " 
 With his career on hold , Hunt continued recording new songs and demos , posting them on his MySpace page , while Popular gained exposure among listeners through online music sharing . In 2009 , he released the compilation album Use in Case of Emergency as a free download through his website . It featured previously unreleased material recorded by Hunt prior to Popular . He also continued touring , worked on an autobiographical book of short stories , entitled Tales of Friction , and studied classical piano . Hunt also took up photography after his girlfriend purchased him a camera . He started out on the streets of Los Angeles , where he photographed subjects on street corners and discarded objects , including furniture and numerous couches he found abandoned on the streets . In an interview for PopMatters , he explained how his <unk> of people there inspired him : " It 's sad as you can quite imagine . It 's also kind of welcoming to me . Sometimes I do get a chance to talk to them and hear a bit of their story . I 'm not the only one out here who had an idea of trying to make it happen . Some of us are luckier than others . Some of us are more prepared than others . That 's just the truth of the situation . " Along with photography , he was stimulated creatively after reading Legs McNeil 's 1997 book Please Kill Me : The Uncensored Oral History of Punk and relating to its themes of artistic frustration and rebelliousness . 
 In a 2009 interview for The Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution , Hunt discussed working as an independent artist , stating " Creatively it is certainly liberating , but the rest of it is really not that fun . I wanted a happy medium between the system of recording , marketing and distribution which I think is very important to any product you want to bring to market ... but I never had that with the record industry . Now that I 'm on the other side of it trying to be the artist and the industry , I realize what the importance of the system was , but I also realize there was a lot that was missing since it is basically dying now . " He also said that he intends on recording another album " at least one more time and then go on tour , and then I don 't know . " 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 Hunt began working on tracks for a follow @-@ up project in 2008 . Two songs from those sessions , " Moving Targets " and " Eyes Like Pearls " , were included on What Were You Hoping For ? . After setting up his own label in 2009 , Hunt began a new process for What Were You Hoping For ? , writing and recording songs for 10 months . In an interview for the Chicago Tribune , he said of his expectations for the album 's recording : " I really wasn 't sure what it would wind up being sonically . I love Bach cello suites , I love punk music , I love old blues , negro spiritual quartets , Muddy Waters ' ' You Need Love . ' There is a simplicity but also a bite that connects all that music , from the growl in the cello to the timbre in Muddy 's voice . I wanted simple music , but with bite , over which I could lay my lyrical shenanigans . " 
 Hunt played several instruments , including guitar , keyboards , drums , bass synthesizer , and the electronic drum . When he finished writing and recording the demos , Hunt began the album 's primary recording sessions at Santa Fe Tracking Station in Los Angeles . With What Were You Hoping For ? , Hunt pursued a " harder edge " and rawer aesthetic than featured on his previous work . He also wanted to explore a self @-@ described " gnarly " guitar sound inspired by the work of Muddy Waters and The Stooges ' 1973 album Raw Power . Hunt attempted the sound in the past , but encountered discouragement from management . He discussed his direction for the album in an interview for The Boombox , stating " [ I ] t wasn 't necessarily punk music . It was more about trying to capture the growl of a cello . That to me is as nasty as it can get . That 's a beautiful sound to me . When people talk about the distortion on the guitar , I hear the same thing with that growl of a cello . " Hunt wanted to take advantage of his newfound feeling of artistic freedom and lack of concern over marketability . 
 Hunt approached the recording sessions differently than on his previous records . Rather than guiding personnel through replicating his demos for the album , he allowed members of his backing band to improvise their parts . For most songs , Hunt recorded with drummer Ruth Price , percussionist and engineer Melissa Mattey , and keyboardist and programmer Peter Dyer . Price and Dyer had auditioned for him at the Musicians Institute in Hollywood and had previously toured with Hunt . He rehearsed with Price for approximately two weeks before recording the final tracks in order to adjust to more rock @-@ based dynamics , including a different set of tempos , chord changes , and faster time cadences , that he wanted for the songs . Price was adept in playing both loose and tight drumming styles for certain songs . Hunt and his band were inspired by recording artists Curtis Mayfield and Iggy Pop , whom he said " brought this kind of intelligence along with the rawness . It was really bold . They just didn 't give a shit . I was like , that 's the attitude that I 'm feeling right now . I feel like I 've finally shed the music that I grew up with . " 
 They subsequently recorded basic tracks , and Hunt approached Peter Dyer to create a backing soundscape for the tracks . What Were You Hoping For ? was later mixed by Melissa Mattey . Hunt has cited its minimalist recording process as his " most hands off approach ... thus far on an album " , calling the approach " musically adept but also stringently unique . People might describe it as futuristic . " 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Expanding on his previous work 's blend of R & B and rock music forms , What Were You Hoping For ? incorporates hard rock , lively funk , sparse ballads , and elements of soul , punk rock , and progressive rock . The music has a loose feel , with grittier guitar and more low fidelity production than on Hunt 's previous albums . The album 's songs are primarily guitar @-@ based and contain jagged , rumbling rhythms , loose guitar riffs , funk licks , and studio effects , including an <unk> use of reverb . Their musical structures are characterized by eccentric arrangements , shifting melodies , and rhythms that vary at offbeat intervals . The songs also feature tense , aggressive soundscapes with sonic influences derived from 1960s psychedelic music and 1970s rock music . Jim Farber from the New York Daily News notes the prevalence of rock music on the album and describes its music as " a surrealist 's notion of soul : prog @-@ rock swayed by R & B ... Lots of songs have the skewed melodic structures of ' 70s Zappa , tempered by ' 80s Red Hot Chili Peppers . " <unk> Blanks of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel characterizes the album 's music as " an amalgamation of Prince 's psychedelic funk , Jimi Hendrix rock and Curtis Mayfield soul " . Hunt 's falsetto vocals on the album feature silky timbre and style . He sings in a variety of musical modes on the songs . 
 Hunt 's songwriting on the album is characterized by resolute lyrics , multi @-@ layered storylines , social commentary , a droll perspective , poetic subtlety , thematic subtext , and whimsy . Songs on the album are unified by a theme of tension and dissonance in modern life . The songs explore topics and issues in contemporary society and culture , including gentrification , identity politics , and mass consumption , accompanied by a sense of hope in Hunt 's lyrics . Hunt explains the album to have a " loose concept " , with songs unified by subject matter concerning " unspoken issues around society " , and says of his lyrical sentiments on the album , " It fits my personality that no matter what 's going on I 'm going to answer it honestly with a wink and a smile . As cliché as it might be , I feel like every situation needs a laugh . " L. Michael Gipson of Creative Loafing notes David Bowie and Lenny Kravitz as references points for Hunt 's songwriting , and writes that What Were You Hoping For ? explores " both sides of the political aisles " with metaphorical songs such as " North Hollywood " , " Designer Jeans " , and the title track , as well as themes concerning an intimate relationship with the songs " Moving Targets " , " Falls ( Violet ) " , and " Cross Dresser " . 
 Certain songs were inspired by the effects of the late @-@ 2000s recession and Hunt 's experience in North Hollywood , a district marked by population density , low income , and other recession @-@ related issues . Hunt said of the district , " There 's so many issues resulting from the recession . People are poor and struggling . " He cited North Hollywood 's " blue @-@ collar aesthetic " as an inspiration for the songwriting : " It 's kind of <unk> , not just to Hollywood but Studio City and Sherman Oaks . North Hollywood isn 't particularly small , but it doesn 't carry the same weight as the other places around it . " Greg Kot calls Hunt 's compositions " frisky and playful " , and writes that most of the album 's lyrical setting is North Hollywood " in decline , populated with hustlers , two @-@ timers ... Money is tight and girlfriends are fickle . Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times comments that much of the album " deals with economic difficulties and its effect on self @-@ identity and love " , and writes of its North Hollywood theme , " Songs about or set in Los Angeles aren 't a rarity . Yet amid the glamour , the noir and the inner @-@ city grit lies plenty of unexplored territory . Van Hunt spends a significant portion of [ the album ] traversing it . " Of Hunt 's perspective on the album , Martens writes that " [ his ] idea of beauty may be somewhat twisted ... informed by artistic roadblocks and career rejection " . 
 The opening track " North Hollywood " is an affectionate ode to Hunt 's community at the time . Its lyrics portray the district as the " crown jewel of saboteurs " and reference its population of misfits and low @-@ lifes , including evicting landlords and conniving starlets . The song features abrasive funk , distorted guitar , and a heavy beat . " Watching You Go Crazy Is Driving Me Insane " features a melodic punk and garage rock style , with dark humor in its lyrics . It is about a couple whose financial difficulties affect their relationship . " Designer Jeans " features lyrics with <unk> musings on the contemporary social climate , including criticism of " mass production and consumption of opinions " and the erasure of independent thought . " Plum " is an ode to a lover 's posterior . " Falls ( Violet ) " is a ballad with a sketchy country music feel . Its narrator expresses support to a woman he is infatuated with as she dates someone else . " Moving Targets " is a bedroom ballad with sparse , 1980s @-@ styled percussion and an Isley Brothers influence . Its lyrics use warfare imagery in detailing a romance . " Eyes Like Pearls " features hard rock guitar and earnest , romantic lyrics , which Hunt explained to The Huffington Post : " It 's a very passionate love , one that 's rarely known in one 's life . They 're obviously tears of joy , but it 's a passion beyond anything I 've ever known . It 's a relationship where somebody understands me and who I understand . " 
 " A Time Machine Is My New Girlfriend " is a frenetic rocker with a Bo Diddley rhythm , and lyrics cautioning listeners that relationships can come with " late fees " . Hunt explained its lyrics to be a metaphor for his lover making him feel younger . The title track features metronomic drumming and chicken scratch riffs . It is about people from different economic classes falling in love after social and economic conditions moved them into the same neighborhood . The setting is described in the first verse , " It 's the end of white flight / even tycoons are licking their wounds / economic blight got the neighborhood looking gap @-@ toothed / end of white flight / maybe now you see something you like / money tight and you 're hating your life " . Hunt said that writing the song was " essentially a response to some of the things I have seen as a result of the global recession we are going through . I wasn 't trying to make any political statement . I was more making a philosophical comment that essentially says we have all these unspoken issues in our society . But I see a collision of those ideas and unresolved issues . My question is what could you have been hoping for when we make the kind of decisions in our society that we have made . " 
 The Prince @-@ inspired " Cross Dresser " has a new wave style and whimsical lyrics in which the narrator holds on to the memory of his lost love by wearing her clothes . Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit : " I just thought it was funny . It 's one of those things that people talk about , but that 's never really happened to me . But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes . It felt good ... It was really quick and I just thought it was something silly and funny . " " It 's a Mysterious Hustle " features somber strings , a languid rhythm , an eerie piano vamp , and bitter singing by Hunt . It was recorded solely by Hunt , who played guitar , keyboards , and electronic drums . Its lyrics are about having to " work your way through the crowd " and " overcome the place you come from " , and view the world as " no place to raise a child " . Its spoken word conclusion preaches , " If you follow the beaten path , it will keep you tied to the past . "

" On July 7 , Hunt released another non @-@ album track , " The Savage , Sincere L of P " , on Paste 's website . It features a soulful rock style and lyrics about the pleasures of the flesh and " the savage , sincere look of pleasure " . The album 's lead single , " Eyes Like Pearls " , was released on September 9 via Hunt 's Facebook page . Hunt also promoted the album with a 20 @-@ date national headlining tour , his first national tour since 2008 . It began on September 19 at Webster Hall in New York City and concluded on October 13 at Yoshi 's in San Francisco . He performed with members of his session band , drummer Ruth Price and keyboardist Peter Dyer , as well as guitarist Douglas Showalter . Prior to the tour , they had played at the 21st NAACP Theatre Awards gala on August 29 . 
 What You Were Hoping For ? received rave reviews from critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received an average score of 90 , based on six reviews . AllMusic 's Andy Kellman called it " a rare lean , focused album where the in @-@ the @-@ red moments are just as effective as the twilight ballads " , while Jason Heller of The A.V. Club said the record was " twice as raw and thrice as hungry as anything the neo @-@ soul mastermind has previously released ... a full @-@ throated , full @-@ throttle challenge " . Writing for <unk> , Jim DeRogatis called it " as joyful , free @-@ ranging , and wildly inventive a psychedelic @-@ soul classic as any you can name " , writing that Hunt 's compositions make " even the wildest , most genre @-@ defying flights of fancy ... instantly accessible and equally stimulating to brain and booty . " Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot dubbed it Hunt 's " most adventurous album yet " because he " stretches the parameters of R & B with a refreshing lack of self @-@ consciousness ... His craftsmanship never devolves into shtick . " Kot later named it the fourth @-@ best album of 2011 and wrote that although it is musically varied , " the glue is Hunt 's acuity as a songwriter ; he knows how to drop hooks and turn a smart phrase , and this album brims with surprises . " Michael Tedder from Paste was slightly more critical , feeling that Hunt " sometimes comes off a bit like he 's exploring the idea of a genre more than actually writing a song " . He cited drummer Ruth Price as the record 's " the secret weapon " . Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called it " a messy album , sometimes thrillingly so , a mélange of psychedelic rock , punk energy and R & B desperation " . 
 Although What You Were Hoping For ? was acclaimed by critics , it received some backlash from Hunt 's fanbase and listeners , who were ambivalent about its stylistic departure from his previous work . He addressed the criticism in an interview for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel : " Other recording artists will supply their fans with an album full of songs they will enjoy for 15 or 20 years . I 'm a man that grows , progresses and matures , I want to grow [ musically ] with the people who want to go with me on that journey ... An artist should put out work that the culture should inspire to as opposed to trying to meet the culture , that 's backwards to me . I don 't just sit down and worry about what people will like , my job is to express myself as honest as I possibly can . " What You Were Hoping For ? peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Albums , which is a weekly music chart that ranks top @-@ selling albums by new or developing acts , defined as those who have never appeared in the top 100 of the Billboard 200 or in the top 10 of Billboard 's component charts . The album also reached number 50 on the Top R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Albums chart .

 = Georges Vézina = 
 Joseph Georges Gonzague Vézina ( / <unk> / ; French : [ ʒɔʁʒ <unk> ] ; January 21 , 1887 – March 27 , 1926 ) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played seven seasons in the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and nine in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) , all with the Montreal Canadiens . After being signed by the Canadiens in 1910 , Vézina played in 327 consecutive regular season games and a further 39 playoff games , before leaving early during a game in 1925 due to illness . Vézina was diagnosed with tuberculosis , and died on March 27 , 1926 . 
 The only goaltender to play for the Canadiens between 1910 and 1925 , Vézina helped the team win the Stanley Cup in 1916 and 1924 , while reaching the Stanley Cup Finals three more times . Nicknamed the " Chicoutimi Cucumber " for his calm composure while in goal , Vézina allowed the fewest goals against in the league seven times in his career : four times in the NHA and three times in the NHL . In 1918 , Vézina became the first NHL goaltender to both record a shutout and earn an assist on a goal . At the start of the 1926 – 27 NHL season , the Canadiens donated the Vezina Trophy to the NHL as an award to the goaltender who allowed the fewest goals during the season . Since 1981 , the award has been given to the most outstanding goaltender as determined by a vote of NHL general managers . In Vézina 's hometown of Chicoutimi , the sports arena is named the Centre Georges @-@ Vézina in his honour . When the Hockey Hall of Fame opened in 1945 , Vézina was one of the original nine inductees . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Georges , the youngest of eight children , was born on January 21 , 1887 , in Chicoutimi , Quebec , to Jacques Vézina , a local baker and an immigrant from St. Nicolas de La Rochelle in France , and his wife Clara . The younger Georges attended school at the Petit Séminaire de Chicoutimi until the age of fourteen , when he left the school to help at his father 's bakery . He played hockey from a young age , participating in informal street hockey matches with others his own age . Vézina partook in these matches in his shoes , and used skates for the first time at age 16 when he joined the local team in Chicoutimi . As Chicoutimi was in a remote area of Quebec , more than 200 kilometres from Quebec City , the hockey club was not in any organised league . Rather the club , known as the <unk> ( " People from the Saguenay " , the region where Chicoutimi is located ) , toured the province , playing exhibition games against a variety of clubs . 
 Vézina married Marie @-@ Adélaïde @-@ Stella Morin on June 3 , 1908 , in Chicoutimi . After Vézina 's death , it was reported that he fathered 22 children . This rumour was started when the Canadiens ' manager , Leo Dandurand , told reporters that Vézina " speaks no English and has twenty @-@ two children , including three sets of triplets , and they were all born in the space of nine years . " In actuality the <unk> only had two children and Georges spoke broken English . In 1912 they had their first child , a son named Jean @-@ Jules . A second son was born the night of the Montreal Canadiens ' first Stanley Cup win in 1916 . To honour the event , Georges named the child Marcel Stanley . When not playing hockey , Vézina operated a tannery in Chicoutimi , living a quiet life .

 On February 17 , 1910 , the Chicoutimi Hockey Club played an exhibition match against the Montreal Canadiens . Though playing an inferior team the Canadiens failed to score a goal , losing the game . This prompted Joseph Cattarinich , goaltender for the Canadiens , to convince his team to offer a tryout to Georges Vézina , who was Chicoutimi 's goaltender . Vézina initially refused the offer , staying in Chicoutimi until the Canadiens returned in December of that year . This time they convinced Georges , along with his brother Pierre , to come to Montreal . The two Vézina brothers arrived on December 22 , 1910 . While Pierre failed to make the team , Georges impressed the Canadiens , especially with the use of his stick to block shots . Vézina was signed to a contract for C $ 800 per season , and made his professional debut December 31 , 1910 , against the Ottawa Senators . He would play all 16 games for the Canadiens in the 1910 – 11 season , finishing with a record of eight wins and eight losses , while allowing the fewest goals in the league . 
 The following season Vézina again led the league in goals against , as well as winning eight games , along with 10 losses . Vézina recorded his first career shutout during the 1912 – 13 season , defeating Ottawa 6 – 0 on January 18 , 1913 , for one of his nine wins in the season . The Canadiens finished first in the NHA for the first time in 1913 – 14 , in a tie with the Toronto Blueshirts . Once again , Vézina led the league with the fewest goals against , while posting 13 victories and seven losses . Under the NHA rules , the first place team would play in the Stanley Cup Finals , but due to the tie for first , the Canadiens had to play a two @-@ game , total @-@ goals series against Toronto . Vézina shut out the Blueshirts in the first game , a 2 – 0 win for Montreal , but let in six goals in the second game , allowing the Blueshirts to play for the Stanley Cup , which they won . 
 After losing 14 games and finishing last in the NHA in 1914 – 15 , Vézina and the Canadiens won 16 games during the 1915 – 16 season , placing the team first in the league . As league leaders , the Canadiens earned the right to play in the 1916 Stanley Cup Finals , where they faced off against the Portland Rosebuds , champions of the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association . The Canadiens defeated the Rosebuds three games to two in the best @-@ of @-@ five @-@ games series , winning the Stanley Cup for the first time in team history . Vézina 's second son was born the night of the fifth game , which coupled with a bonus of $ 238 each member of the Canadiens received for the championship , led to him considering the series as the pinnacle of his career . The following season Vézina again led the NHA with the fewest goals against , the fourth time in seven years he did so , helping the Canadiens to again reach the Stanley Cup Finals , where they lost to the Seattle Metropolitans . 
 = = = NHL = = = 
 The NHA gave way to the National Hockey League ( NHL ) in November 1917 , with Vézina and the Canadiens joining the new league . On February 18 , 1918 , he became the first goaltender in NHL history to record a shutout , by blanking the Torontos 9 – 0 . On December 28 , 1918 , he became the first goaltender to be credited with an assist , on a goal by Newsy Lalonde , who had just picked up the puck after a save by Vézina . He finished the season with 12 wins , allowing the fewest goals against . Vézina also set a record , which was shared with Clint Benedict of the Ottawa Senators , for the fewest shutouts needed to lead the league , with one . 
 In 1918 – 19 Vézina won 10 games and helped the Canadiens defeat the Ottawa Senators in the NHL playoffs for the right to play for the Stanley Cup against the PCHA champion , the Seattle Metropolitans . Held in Seattle , the two teams were tied in the best @-@ of @-@ five series when it was cancelled due to the Spanish flu epidemic , the first time the Stanley Cup was not awarded . In the 10 playoff games prior to the cancellation , Vézina had won six games , lost three and tied one , with one shutout . Vézina recorded nearly identical records the next two seasons , with 13 wins , 11 losses and a goals against average above four in both 1919 – 20 and 1920 – 21 . He won 12 games the following season , as the Canadiens again failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup . 
 After winning 13 games in 1922 – 23 , Vézina led the Canadiens into the NHL playoffs , where they lost the two @-@ game , total @-@ goal series to the Senators , who would win the Stanley Cup . The following season saw Vézina return to leading the league in fewest goals against . His average of 1 @.@ 97 goals per game was the first time a goaltender had averaged fewer than two goals against per game . With another 13 @-@ win season in 1923 – 24 , the Canadiens reached the NHL playoffs , where they again faced the Ottawa Senators . This time the Canadiens won the series , then defeated the Vancouver Maroons of the PCHA before reaching the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in five years . Playing the Calgary Tigers of the Western Canada Hockey League , Vézina and the Canadiens won the best @-@ of @-@ three series two games to none , as Vézina recorded a shutout in the second game . The championship was the Canadiens ' first as a member of the NHL and second title as a club . After a 17 @-@ win season in 1924 – 25 where Vézina recorded a goals @-@ against average of 1 @.@ 81 to again lead the league , the Canadiens reached the Stanley Cup Finals . The Canadiens only qualified after the Hamilton Tigers , the regular season champions , were suspended for refusing to play in the playoffs unless they were paid more . Facing the Victoria Cougars , the Canadiens lost the series three games to one . 
 Returning to Montreal for training camp for the 1925 – 26 season , Vézina was noticeably ill , though he said nothing about it . By the time of the Canadiens ' first game on November 28 against the Pittsburgh Pirates , he had lost 35 pounds in a span of six weeks , and had a fever of 102 Fahrenheit . Regardless , he took to the ice , and completed the first period without allowing a goal . Vézina began vomiting blood in the intermission before returning for the start of the second period . He then collapsed in his goal area , and left the game , with former U.S. Olympic team goaltender Alphonse Lacroix taking his place . 
 The day after the game , Vézina was diagnosed with tuberculosis and advised to return home . He made a last trip into the Canadiens ' dressing room on December 3 to say a final goodbye to his teammates . Dandurand would later describe Vézina as sitting in his corner of the dressing room with " tears rolling down his cheeks . He was looking at his old pads and skates that Eddie Dufour [ the Canadiens trainer ] had arranged in Georges ' corner . Then , he asked one little favour — the sweater he had worn in the last world series . " Vézina returned to his hometown of Chicoutimi with his wife Marie , where he died in the early hours on Saturday , March 27 , 1926 , at l 'Hôtel @-@ Dieu hospital . Though he played only one period for the Canadiens during the entire season , the team honoured his entire $ 6 @,@ 000 salary , a testament to how important Vézina had been to the team . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 One of the dominant goaltenders in the NHA and early NHL , Vézina led the Canadiens to five Stanley Cup Finals appearances , where they won the title twice . Seven times in his career , Vézina had the lowest goals @-@ against average in the league he played , and he had the second @-@ best average another five times . From when he joined the Canadiens in 1910 , until being forced to retire in 1925 , Vézina never missed a game nor allowed a substitute , playing in 328 consecutive regular season games and an additional 39 playoff games . Though he played the bulk of his career in an era when goaltenders could not leave their feet to make a save ( the rule was changed in 1918 ) , Vézina is regarded as one of the greatest goaltenders in hockey history ; the Montreal Standard referred to him as the " greatest goaltender of the last two decades " in their obituary . 
 Well liked in Montreal , Vézina was often seen as the best player on the ice for the Canadiens , and was respected by his teammates , who considered him the spiritual leader of the team . Referred to as " le <unk> de Chicoutimi " ( the " Chicoutimi Cucumber " ) for his cool demeanour on the ice , he was also known as " l <unk> <unk> " ( the " silent <unk> " , <unk> being a nickname for the Canadiens ) , a reference to his reserved personality . He often sat in a corner of the team 's dressing room alone , smoking a pipe and reading the newspaper . When news of Vézina 's death was announced , newspapers across Quebec paid tribute to the goalie with articles about his life and career . Hundreds of Catholic masses were held in honour of the devout Vézina , and more than 1 @,@ 500 people filled the Chicoutimi cathedral for his funeral . 
 A lasting legacy of Vézina was the trophy named after him . At the start of the 1926 – 27 season , Leo Dandurand , Leo Letourneau and Joseph Cattarinich , owners of the Montreal Canadiens , donated the Vezina Trophy to the NHL in honour of Vézina . It was to be awarded to the goaltender of the team who allowed the fewest goals during the regular season . The inaugural winner of the trophy was Vézina 's successor in goal for the Canadiens , George Hainsworth . He went on to win the trophy the next two seasons as well . In 1981 , the NHL changed the format of awarding the trophy , instead giving it to the goaltender deemed best in the league based on a poll of NHL general managers . The Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1945 and among the first nine inductees was Vézina . In 1998 Vézina was ranked number 75 on The Hockey News ' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players . In honour of the first professional athlete to come from Chicoutimi , the city renamed their hockey arena the Centre Georges @-@ Vézina in 1965 .

 = Dave ( Lost ) = 
 " Dave " is the 43rd episode of Lost and the 18th episode of the second season . The episode was directed by Jack Bender , and written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz . It first aired on April 5 , 2006 , on ABC . In flashbacks , Hugo " Hurley " Reyes is in a mental institution , where he deals with an imaginary friend , Dave . Libby also has a brief flashback in this episode , revealing that she attended the institution along with Hurley . The island events in the present day have Hurley seeing Dave on the island , while other survivors confront " Henry Gale " ( Michael Emerson ) after his stated backstory is revealed to be false . 
 The episode addresses a fan theory which considered the events of the series to be hallucinations or dreams . The character of Dave was written as both a side of Hurley who denied his problems and an analogue to Hurley 's disappeared father , and his scenes were filmed so that his reveal as imaginary would be a plot twist . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Flashback = = = 
 Hurley ( Jorge Garcia ) is in a mental institution , where he is friends with Dave ( Evan Handler ) , who tells Hurley to ignore the doctors , avoid his medication , and try to escape . One day , Hurley 's doctor , Dr. Brooks ( Bruce Davison ) , proves to Hurley that Dave is not real , by taking a photo of the two , and then showing Hurley that Dave is not in the picture . Later that night , Dave wakes Hurley up to escape with him from the institute . Dave hops out of a window , but Hurley confronts him and declares that Dave is not real , and shuts the window on him before going back to bed . 
 A later flashback reveals that during the moment Dr. Brooks took the picture of Hurley and Dave , another patient was staring at Hurley from across the room , Libby ( Cynthia Watros ) , which explains why Hurley has had this faint recognition of Libby while on the island . 
 = = = On the island = = = 
 Hurley confesses to Libby that he has an eating disorder , and shows her a stash of Dharma food . Hurley expresses interest in getting rid of it , and she encourages him to do so . Just after Hurley destroys his supplies , other survivors go into the jungle . Following them , Hurley and Libby see that an enormous package of food parachuted from the sky . After Hurley panics at the suggestion of again being in charge of the supplies , he sees Dave , and tries to follow him as he goes into the jungle . 
 After Hurley loses Dave 's trail twice , and berates Sawyer ( Josh Holloway ) for mocking him , he decides to leave the beach and go to the caves . On the way , Dave reappears , and tells Hurley that everything that has happened since the night of the escape attempt has been a fantasy — that after Dave escaped , Hurley went into a catatonic state and has imagined everything since then . As proof , Dave points out the appearances of the numbers said by another intern , Leonard ( Ron <unk> ) in both Hurley 's winning lottery ticket and the hatch computer number @-@ sequence . Dave takes Hurley to a cliff , and tells him to jump and get out of his dream , before jumping off himself . Before Hurley can decide whether or not to follow Dave , Libby finds him . Hurley states to her he believes everything happening is not real , and is only a comatose dream , including her , but Libby convinces him otherwise , in part by kissing him . 
 In the hatch , Sayid ( Naveen Andrews ) and Ana @-@ Lucía ( Michelle Rodriguez ) interrogate " Henry Gale " ( Michael Emerson ) . After Henry 's new cover @-@ up story is proved false , Henry finally admits that he is indeed an Other , but says he would be killed if he talks . Later , Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) confronts the prisoner , demanding to know if he let himself be caught , thinking it might have been to find the Swan . " Henry " , however , calls the hatch a " joke " , saying that during the lockdown , he never entered the numbers into the computer or pushed the button ; he simply stood there , and watched the timer 's numbers turn to red hieroglyphs before they reset back on their own . Locke , however , replies angrily that Henry is lying , but he replies that he 's " done lying " . 
 = = Production = = 
 ABC was concerned about the content of the episode , arguing that the idea that the story could be all in Hurley 's head was offering an explanation for the show as a whole , since a recurring theory among the fandom was that the events of the series were hallucinations . The character of Dave was meant to be a side of Hurley who felt he had no problem , and encourages Hurley to overeat , and is played by Evan Handler in a way director Jack Bender described as " mischievous , impish @-@ like " . Showrunner Carlton Cuse revealed his name comes from Hurley 's father , David Reyes - who would later appear in the series played by Cheech Marin - because the writers " wanted Hurley to imagine a friend and have that be wrapped up in his unresolved relationship with his dad " . The final scene with Libby was so secret that only Jack Bender and his assistant director had it in their scripts , and to prevent Libby from being the only woman in the mental institution , every woman on the set , including Bender 's daughter Sophie , was dressed in robes and pajamas to appear as background characters . 
 Director Bender decided to depict Dave in a way audiences would first believe him to be real , but without the character actually interacting with the physical world , similar to films such as The Sixth Sense and A Beautiful Mind . For the scene in which Dave walks through the jungle with Hurley , red and orange flowers were placed to add some " magic " to the scene , something Bender described as a " ' Hurley in Wonderland ' feel " . The scene in which Hurley attacks Sawyer was intended to be a humorous moment , with Bender suggesting that the tent be knocked over , and Josh Holloway adding Sawyer trying to escape but being pulled back . 
 The scene in which Dave starts listing to Hurley why the island events are occurring in his mind suffered from continuous interruption , as military exercises on Joint Base Pearl Harbor @-@ Hickam led to many takes being ruined by plane noises . Weather problems also plagued production , with loud waves causing Hurley 's and Libby 's beach scene to be redubbed in post @-@ production , and rain on one day changing the location of the basketball game scene to an indoor court , and also leading to a second day of filming on the cliff . The cliff was digitally redesigned in post @-@ production to appear as if the actors were standing on the edge . Dave 's jump was done by making a stunt double jump in front of a bluescreen , with the body hitting the water and resulting splash being rendered through computer graphics . The mental hospital was shot at the Laniakea YWCA in Honolulu , except for Dr. Brooks 's office , which was done inside a studio . 
 = = Reception = = 
 16 @.@ 38 million American viewers tuned into this episode . Reviews were mixed . Scott Brown of Entertainment Weekly praised Jorge Garcia 's and Michael Emerson 's performances , and said that the episode made the island " feel dangerous again " . Ryan J. Budke of TV Squad felt that the B @-@ story in the hatch was more interesting than Hurley 's scenes , and considered " Dave " depressing , in opposition to the other " so light @-@ hearted " Hurley @-@ centered episodes . IGN 's Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7 out of 10 , considering it entertaining even if it " doesn 't really impact the series as a whole , " but the website later ranked " Dave " as the 9th worst Lost episode ever , describing it as meaningless and saying the flashback " felt pretty extraneous . " New York magazine listed " Dave " sixth in a " Twenty Most Pointless Episodes of Lost " list , considering that " using an episode to disprove a theory that wasn ’ t so prevalent was a waste of time . " On the other hand , the Los Angeles Times ranked the episode as the 30th best of the series , describing it as " perhaps the most misunderstood episode of Lost ever , " saying that Dave not being real was meant to be a twist , but just " the biggest expression of just how messed up Hurley was before he found the island .

 = Mr. Lady Records = 
 Mr. Lady Records ( or Mr. Lady Records and Video ) was a San Francisco @-@ based lesbian @-@ feminist independent record label and video art distributor . Artists on the label included Le Tigre and The Butchies . <unk> magazine noted that Mr. Lady was " queercore 's strongest label . " 
 The label was founded in 1996 in Durham , North Carolina by musician Kaia Wilson and artist / UNC photography professor Tammy Rae Carland , aiming to redress what they saw as a lack of feminist record labels at the time . As well as a range of recording artists , the label was also heavily involved in other events that promoted feminist thinking and music , such as the Michigan Womyn 's Music Festival – which led to some controversy in 1999 – and various art showcases . Mr. Lady closed down in June 2004 . 
 = = Founding = = 
 Kaia Wilson was a member of lesbian punk group The Butchies , and felt their " out politics held them back . " Without a record company to specifically represent the work of herself and other " out " female musicians , Wilson and her girlfriend , Tammy Rae Carland , found their opportunities limited . Subsequently , they formed Mr. Lady to redress the " lack of enough women and / or dyke run record labels , " which they felt led to an " extremely limited amount of affordable and accessible means for independent artists to distribute their work . " Thus , Mr. Lady Records was started with , in Wilson 's words , " $ 35 and a lotta ... faith . " 
 Wilson stated the name " Mr. Lady " came from a trip to Italy while on tour with Team Dresch : " I saw a store called Mr. Baby , and it freaked me out . Then everyone started calling me Mr. Baby . Then I became Mr. Baby onstage . I had my own theme song and everything . I wore a little eyeliner mustache . From there it changed into Mr. Lady , which just seemed like a good name for a queer label . " It also related to Ladyman , Wilson 's first solo LP , produced with the aid of Melissa York after they both left lesbian " supergroup " Team Dresch . 
 = = Artists and releases = = 
 Mr. Lady Records released recordings by groups such as Kathleen Hanna 's lo @-@ fi group Le Tigre ( who released their first two records – Le Tigre and Feminist Sweepstakes – with Mr. Lady ) , punk group The Butchies ( of whom Kaia Wilson is the lead singer ) , British group Electrelane , Tara Jane O 'Neil , spoken @-@ word collective Sister Spit ( Sini Anderson and Michelle Tea ) , and others . In March 2001 , Calling All Kings & Queens , a sampler album , was released which featured eighteen tracks from various artists and friends of the label , including Sleater @-@ Kinney and Team Dresch . It followed 1999 's New Women 's Music Sampler . 
 = = A focus on women musicians = = 
 No band that signed with Mr. Lady contained a male artist . Carland said " It 's not that we 're necessarily never going to put out a band with men in it , but it 's just kind of organically happened that way . We wanted to focus on putting out music by women . We do consider ourselves a feminist business and part of that involves prioritizing work made by women . " 
 Due to their work with Mr. Lady , Wilson and Carland were described as two of the " 100 most influential gay people in the world " by About.com in 2002 . 
 = = Growing popularity = = 
 Although initially a vehicle for Wilson to release her own albums , Mr. Lady grew into a label whose musical and political contributions gained national attention . During a review of Tami Hart 's debut release with Mr. Lady , online magazine PopMatters described the label as " one of the bright spots in new music . Whether the groups or singers are punk or indie , they are all anti @-@ mainstream hip , political , and good – really good . " <unk> magazine described the label in 2004 as " lead [ ing ] the way when it came to releasing music that was as politically significant as it was danceable . " 
 Initially distributing music through mail order , the label signed a deal to distribute records nationally across the US in 2001 . The Independent Weekly described the label as having " grown from a community that perhaps needed it the most , " contrasting the scarcity of a gay / lesbian @-@ oriented label in the southern United States at the time with the many in New York . 
 = = Involvement with the Michigan Womyn 's Music Festival = = 
 In 1999 , Mr. Lady records ( along with one of its artists , The Butchies ) , were involved in issues surrounding the debate as to whether transsexual women should be entitled to attend the Michigan Womyn 's Music Festival , which had a formal stance against allowing transsexual and transgender women to attend the festival . In response to a request from transgender activists to boycott the festival , Mr. Lady released a statement which defended the festival , believing that they did not consider an event for " womyn born womyn " and the transgender community to be mutually exclusive , but backed the right of the festival to exclude those not born as women . 
 Kaia Wilson confirmed this in a June 1999 statement : " [ W ] e strongly believe that transgender / transsexual people are an important part of the queer community and that they face an enormous amount of opposition . [ ... ] We know that the <unk> started as a separatist event for womyn born womyn and we personally still feel the continued need for that kind of space and event . [ ... ] We don 't think that our support of the trans communities and womyn born womyn communities are in direct contradiction to each other . " 
 Formally backing the festival 's trans @-@ exclusion policy led to protests and boycotts aimed towards Mr. Lady acts , Wilson and The Butchies in particular . Groups such as Camp Trans , and many participants in the queercore community disagreed with Mr. Lady 's stance and felt that the group and label exploited transgender images . The label went defunct in June 2004 .

 Mr. Lady Records has sponsored numerous showcases of feminist and lesbian music , including events at the Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus in Minneapolis , Minnesota ( working with the Queer Student Cultural Center ) and " Mr. Sister " , a showcase at the National Queer Arts Festival in 2003 at the Center for Lesbian Gay Bi Transgender Art & Culture in San Francisco .

 Joseph William Kennedy was born in Nacogdoches , Texas on May 30 , 1916 , the son of Joseph and Mattie Kennedy . He attended Stephen F. Austin State Teachers College , from which he received a Bachelor of Arts ( BA ) degree , and the University of Kansas , which awarded him a Master of Arts ( MA ) degree . He then entered the University of California , Berkeley , where he earned his Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD ) degree , writing his thesis on " Studies of nuclear isomerism in tellurium , element 43 , and zinc " , under the supervision of George Ernest Gibson . 
 = = Plutonium = = 
 In February 1940 , Glenn Seaborg and Edwin McMillan produced plutonium @-@ 239 through the bombardment of uranium . In their experiments bombarding uranium with deuterons , they observed the creation of neptunium , element 93 , which then underwent beta @-@ decay to form a new element , plutonium , with 94 protons . Kennedy built a series of detectors and counters to verify the presence of plutonium . He used mica sliced razor thin to produce a window to count alpha particle emissions , and ionization chamber with a magnetic field to separate the beta particles from the neptunium from alpha particles from the plutonium . 
 On March 28 , 1941 , Seaborg , physicist Emilio Segrè and Kennedy were able to demonstrate not only the presence of plutonium , but that was fissile , an important distinction that was crucial to the decisions made in directing Manhattan Project research . Arthur Wahl then began exploring the chemistry of the newly discovered element . In 1966 , Room 307 of Gilman Hall on the campus at the Berkeley , where they did this work , was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark . 
 = = Manhattan Project = = 
 Kennedy was one of the early recruits to Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos National Laboratory , arriving in March 1943 . He became acting head of the Chemistry and Metallurgy ( CM ) Division . There was concern amongst the project leadership about Kennedy , as he was only 26 years old at the time . An approach was therefore made to Charles Thomas from Monsanto . Thomas agreed to co @-@ ordinate the Chemistry efforts of the different Manhattan Project laboratories , but he did not wish to move to New Mexico . Despite his youth , Kennedy officially became CM Division leader in April 1944 . 
 The CM Division was responsible for the purification and fabrication of materials for the bomb , including the core , tamper and initiator . The chemistry and metallurgy of uranium was fairly well known , although it did yield a few surprises , but that of plutonium was almost completely unknown . The element had only been discovered a short time before , and existed only in microgram amounts . Educated guesses about its chemistry tended to be wrong , and as research progressed it was found to have unusual properties , including no less than six allotropes . There was rivalry between its discoverers , with Wahl and Kennedy 's group at Los Alamos competing with Seaborg 's in Chicago to produce the best process for purifying the metal . This competition ended abruptly when Segrè 's group at Los Alamos discovered that high levels of a hitherto undiscovered plutonium @-@ 240 isotope in reactor @-@ produced plutonium meant that an implosion @-@ type nuclear weapon was required , and a high degree of purity was therefore unnecessary . 
 Kennedy 's chemists were able to reduce uranium hydride to uranium @-@ 235 metal with 99 @.@ 96 % efficiency , and the metallurgists worked out how to cast and press it into the required shapes . While the chemists worked out how to purify plutonium , the metallurgists had to figure out how to cast it into a solid sphere . Eric Jette 's CM @-@ 8 ( Uranium and Plutonium Metallurgy ) group found that they could stabilise plutonium in its malleable δ phase by alloying it with gallium . For his services , he was awarded the Medal for Merit by the President Harry S. Truman in 1946 .

 In 1945 , Kennedy was recruited as a professor at Washington University in St. Louis , and was installed as Chairman of the Department of Chemistry in 1946 , a role he continued in until his death . Kennedy brought with him Wahl , Lindsay Helmholz , David Lipkin , Herbert <unk> , and Samuel Weissman , who all served on the faculty at Washington University . Up to this time , Washington University was primarily concerned with undergraduate teaching . Kennedy is credited with transforming it into a university that also has boasts strong graduate and research programs . 
 Along with Seaborg , McMillan and Wahl , Kennedy received $ 400 @,@ 000 dollars from the Atomic Energy Commission in compensation for their scientific work . He died on May 5 , 1957 at the age of 40 after a battle with cancer of the stomach . The Kennedy Lecture series is named in his honor . It is given every year in Washington University .

 " Andy 's Play " is the third episode of the seventh season of the American comedy television series The Office , and the show 's 129th episode overall . Written by Charlie Grandy and directed by John Stuart Scott , the episode aired on NBC in the United States on October 7 , 2010 . Guest stars include Robert Mammana , Phil Abrams and Robert R. Shafer . 
 The series — presented as if it were a real documentary — depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania , branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In the episode , Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) lands a role in a local production of Sweeney Todd and invites the entire office to the performance , hoping to impress his former girlfriend , Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) . While Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) struggles to put his jealousy aside , Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) and Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) have trouble with their less @-@ than @-@ stellar babysitter , Erin . 
 Originally , the producers and writers wanted the in @-@ show musical to be performed badly , but they later changed their minds and decided that the musical should be quality work , according to Helms . The episode featured several guest actors and actresses to round out the parts in the musical . " Andy 's Play " was viewed by 6 @.@ 95 million viewers and received a 3 @.@ 5 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49 , marking a slight drop in the ratings when compared to the previous week . Despite this , the episode was the highest @-@ ranked NBC series of the night and received positive reviews from critics , many of whom enjoyed the character @-@ driven story . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) is going to perform in a local production of Sweeney Todd , and he wants his co @-@ workers to come . He makes a special effort to invite Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) , whom he hopes to win back with a good performance . Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) is especially hard to convince , since he is still upset that he was not asked to play the part of Sweeney Todd after his own audition . Andy informs him that no one auditioning got the part of Sweeney Todd , which was instead given to a veteran " world class " actor , and Michael agrees to go . Jim ( John Krasinski ) and Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) say they want to go , but have been unable to find a babysitter for their daughter Cece . Erin agrees to come , but she later decides to babysit Cece so Pam and Jim can come instead . 
 On the night of the show , Darryl Philbin reads from the program that contrary to Andy 's assumption , the actor ( Robert Mammana ) playing Sweeney Todd has no acting or singing experience , and was discovered by the director while singing karaoke . Put out by this , Michael steals a bottle of wine from the concessions table , which he and his co @-@ workers drink during the show . Andy , upset that Erin is not in the audience , repeatedly checks for messages from her on his cell phone . While he is on stage , his phone rings in his pocket , disrupting the musical and forcing the performers to improvise . To make matters worse , Michael drops his bottle of wine , causing a commotion as it rolls . Then he loses grip of balloons he brought to his seat , which pop as they hit the top of the hall . This startles a baby , and the sound of her cries alerts Jim and Pam to the fact that Erin came to the play with Cece , exciting Andy , but angering Jim and Pam . At the end of the show , everyone cheers except for Michael , who angrily boos the actor playing Sweeney Todd . During the party for the performers afterwards , the director compliments Michael on the " energy " of his audition and encourages him to audition again , suggesting that he felt that Sweeney Todd simply wasn 't the right production for Michael 's acting style . 
 Angela Martin ( Angela Kinsey ) , having found a loophole in her parenting contract with Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) which permits him to develop romantic feelings for her , attempts to attract him . She uses another technicality in the contract to force him to take her to Andy 's play as a date , and wears uncharacteristically revealing clothing . But when Dwight becomes lustful , Angela rebuffs him and insists that they count the date as one of their five required instances of sexual intercourse . Meanwhile , Andy and Erin chat backstage , and Erin states how happy she is that they are spending time together outside of the Office . This moment ends when Erin leaves with her boyfriend , Gabe Lewis ( Zach Woods ) . As Andy sulks backstage , his co @-@ workers arrive and cheer him up . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Andy 's Play " was written by supervising producer Charlie Grandy , his fifth writing credit for the show . The episode was directed by John Stuart Scott , his first and only directing credit for the show . With the seventh season of The Office being Carell 's last , the writers decided to divide the season into two distinct halves ; the first half would " celebrate Carell 's finale year and highlight different actors on the show " , whereas the second half would focus on his departure and the search for a new manager . As such , " Andy 's Play " was one of the first episode of the season to specifically highlight " potential heirs to the throne " , in this case Ed Helms ' character , Andy . 
 According to Helms , the original script called for the musical numbers to be " slaughtered " by the actors and actresses . However , as the episode was being finalized , the producers decided for the cast to " perform razor @-@ sharp renditions " of the songs instead . Due to the ensemble nature of the musical featured in the episode , guest actors and actresses were required . Actor Robert Mammana portrayed Mitchel Walsh , who played the title role in the play within the play . Heather Marie Marsden played Mrs. Lovett , Maxwell Glick appeared Tobias , and Phil Abrams appeared as Shelby Thomas Weems , the musical 's director . 
 The Season Seven DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode . Notable cut scenes include Andy discussing the " crowd dynamic " at musicals and music events , Gabe discussing his history of playing Ichabod Crane in three separate play productions , Pam and Jim discussing how hard it is to get a babysitter , Michael ordering flowers , Andy getting a pep talk from his director , Phyllis worrying about Cynthia and Bob bonding , and Kevin talking to his sister who happens to be playing a part in the musical .

 The songs featured in the episode from the actual Sweeney Todd musical are " The Ballad of Sweeney Todd " , " Johanna " , and " By the Sea " . Erin accidentally references The Baby @-@ sitters Club , a series of novels by Ann M. Martin , when talking about breaking into the babysitting business in Scranton . Michael brings balloons to the musical , Phyllis notes that they remind her of the 2009 Pixar film Up . Jim mentions that trying to put CeCe to sleep reminds him of the 2008 war film The Hurt Locker . The ending scene features Michael auditioning for the musical by re @-@ acting of an entire episode of the American police procedural and legal drama television series Law & Order , complete with opening monologue and theme music . Andy sings Macy Gray 's single " I Try " with the rest of the office to cheer himself up at the end of the episode .

 " Andy 's Play " first aired on October 7 , 2010 . In its original American broadcast , it was viewed by an estimated 6 @.@ 95 million viewers with a 3 @.@ 5 rating / 10 percent share among adults between the age of 18 and 49 . This means that 3 @.@ 5 percent of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ old households watched the episode , and ten percent of that demographic had their televisions tuned to the channel at any point . This marked a 0 @.@ 2 rating decrease from the previous weeks episode , although the episode ranked second in its time slot and was the highest @-@ rated NBC series of the night . 
 This episode received mostly positive reviews from critics . James Poniewozik of Time magazine wrote that , " ' Andy 's Play ' was the kind of strong , character driven episode I 've missed from the show — not just good by later season standards but an actual good Office episode , period . " Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic wrote that the episode was a reminder of " what has always been great about this show " . Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that the episode " worked largely because it embraced [ the ] idea " that " the bonds you form at work go deeper than carpet , and that if you work with people long enough they can feel like your family . " He ultimately concluded that the episode was one that " makes me happy [ that ] I spent an evening in the company of these goofballs . " 
 Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club gave the episode a " B + " , stating that it was " inconclusive " proof whether or not Andy could be the show 's lead , in advance of Steve Carell 's exit from the series , but that " in terms of providing entertainment , I think the episode worked quite well " and was " honest and charming " . Vulture writer Phoebe Reilly was slightly critical of Apple product placements — Ryan 's iPad and Andy 's iPhone — but found the use of the second " still funny : the signature chirp of Andy ’ s iPhone interrupts a scene , prompting him to pretend it ’ s a bird that he has to silence by saying , ' He 's gone to sleep now . I 've closed his beak . ' " 
 Many reviews commented upon Andy 's phone @-@ interrupted onstage scene . Poniewozik praised " Andy ’ s flop @-@ sweat attempt to improvise his way out of his cellphone 's going off while running up against the limits of what his character knows about Sweeney " , calling it " hilarious " . Forcella was complimentary towards " the awkward moment when his phone didn 't stop ringing and [ Andy ] had to explain it on stage " , noting that it had " brilliant timing and execution . " 
 = Hanley Castle High School = 
 Hanley Castle High School , formerly known as Hanley Castle Grammar School , was probably founded in 1326 , making it one of the oldest schools in England . Located in the village of Hanley Castle , 1 @.@ 4 miles ( 2 @.@ 2 km ) from the small town of Upton @-@ upon @-@ Severn , Worcestershire , for much of the 20th century it was a selective boys grammar school that grew from about 50 to around 200 day @-@ pupils and boarders . In 1972 , the school opened its doors to girls . In 1974 it became a mixed gender , voluntary controlled comprehensive school and it started to intake pupils at age 14 on transfer from the Hill School in nearby Upton @-@ upon @-@ Severn . The school reverted to being an 11 – 18 school in the 1990s and the population of students grew over time to around 900 in 2012 . In 2011 the school became an academy . 
 The campus comprises 17th century Grade II listed buildings that are still in use alongside those of the major expansions of the late 20th , and early 21st century . The school serves a large , mainly rural area roughly bounded by Malvern to the west , Worcester to the north , and the county of Gloucestershire to the south . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1326 a chantry school was established to teach local children music , reading and writing , so that they could become part of the choir of St Mary 's church . Deeds dating from 1523 and 1544 are the earliest extant documents , and the Church of England episcopal archives record a Philippus Frye as being a master at the school in 1582 . In 1633 new trustees were installed , and in 1733 the school house was rebuilt on funds donated by Sir Nicholas and Mr Edmund Lechmere . For several centuries , the school functioned under the patronage of the baronets and hereditary peers of the Lechmere family who have been settled in Hanley Castle , Worcestershire , since the 11th century . The baronets were traditionally chairmen or members of the board of governors until at least the mid @-@ 1970s . The school 's emblem is the same pelican that is the central feature of the Lechmere family coat of arms . In 1868 in order to improve the teaching standards , a new headmaster was installed by the trustees , the school was rebuilt in 1869 and divided into an endowed grammar school for the sons of the middle classes and an elementary school providing the labouring and agricultural classes with a basic education . Following further changes in 1893 , the primary school was named St Mary 's Primary School and was relocated in the nearby hamlet of Cross Hands and the grammar school provided education for boys from the age of 8 to 17 . 
 In 1909 funds were allocated by Worcestershire County Council for the construction of new classrooms and the appointment of governors was supervised by the council . The number of students increased from 55 in 1921 , to 172 in 1946 with 4 boys in the sixth form . By the late 1950s , a first modern extension including new classrooms a science laboratory , and modern sanitary facilities had been constructed , and the number of pupils had increased to 217 boys aged 11 to 18 who were generally admitted by selection after passing the Eleven Plus exam . About 50 of the pupils were boarders , and although government owned , the school was still run very much on the traditional lines of a typical English " Public School " of which there were many in the Malvern area . With 42 students in the sixth form in 1962 , an urgent request for further extensions to the school became a subject of debate in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom . 
 Compared with other schools in the county , Hanley Castle was still small , and in 1969 following changes in government education policy , the school was developed more on the lines of a comprehensive school to introduce a focus on vocational as well as academic education . The boarding section was closed down , the dormitories , resident staff quarters , and the clinic were converted to classrooms and teachers ' offices , and girls were admitted for the first time in 1972 , allowing them to benefit from its high standards of teaching . In 1974 the school became a comprehensive school and was renamed Hanley Castle High School . At this stage , although there were still pupils under the age of 14 , the new intake of pupils came each year by transfer of pupils from " The Hill School " ( now closed ) at Tunnel Hill , Upton @-@ upon @-@ Severn . Prior to that The Hill had been a state secondary school for children aged 11 – 18 . The Hill was renamed " The Hill Junior High School " in 1974 as part of the same round of changes . In 1991 , Hanley Castle High School returned to being an age 11 – 18 High School following the two @-@ tier school system , and the Hill Junior High School was closed . By 2002 the student population at Hanley Castle High School had increased to around 850 , and to around 1 @,@ 000 by 2006 . On 23 September 2011 the school celebrated the beginning of the new school year with its newly granted academy status . Presiding over the event , the Member of Parliament for the constituency , Harriett Baldwin stated “ Hanley Castle has been a successful school for hundreds of years and I am delighted to be able to mark its transformation into an academy . I feel enormous pride whenever I visit the school and it is clear that the staff and governors are doing an amazing job . ” 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The school has existed for almost 700 years , and has retained many of its original features . The oldest parts are listed buildings dating from around 1600 , include the Grade II western wing , formerly a dormitory and since the 21st century largely converted to use for administration and teachers ' facilities , and the former headmaster 's house now serving as the sixth form centre . Additions to the campus in the late 20th and early 21st centuries have been carefully designed to harmonise with the historic architecture without disturbing the original character , and include science laboratories , a gym , a sports hall , and a performance hall , as well as new classrooms . A £ 2 million dedicated language centre was added in 2008 . 
 = = Facilities = = 
 With the changes in 1969 many of the old traditions were lost in the course of modernisation along with the demolition of older buildings that have been replaced by extensive expansion . The school nevertheless retains its centuries @-@ old stance as the focal point of the tiny village , and its high standards of academic achievement . The campus now comprises many new buildings that include six science laboratories , two computer rooms , two music rooms , a drama studio , two art studios and five craft , design and technology work areas . Funded by Worcester County Council and Malvern Hills District Council , a £ 650 @,@ 000 sports hall accommodating four badminton courts was added in 2002 . The school also has a self @-@ contained sixth @-@ form college on site , with around 200 students studying for their A levels . A modern , purpose built 2 @-@ storey language centre was added to the campus in 2008 , and is fully equipped with language learning technology including overhead LCD projectors , interactive whiteboards , and laptop computers to convert any of the classrooms into language laboratories .

 In 2011 following a successful application , the school was converted to Academy , a new status introduced by the Department of Education ( DoE ) in 2010 for well performing schools that accords them more autonomy of management and direct government funding . Under the government scheme , the school benefits from release from control of the LEA , thus enabling the school to directly hire staff and set their own rates of pay , design its own structure of curricula , and to set its own annual school year calendar . Through the DoE Young People ’ s Learning Agency the school may also receive additional grants that would not be available from the local education authority ( LEA ) .

 Joseph Francis Shea ( September 5 , 1925 – February 14 , 1999 ) was an American aerospace engineer and NASA manager . Born in the New York City borough of the Bronx , he was educated at the University of Michigan , receiving a Ph.D. in Engineering Mechanics in 1955 . After working for Bell Labs on the radio inertial guidance system of the Titan I intercontinental ballistic missile , he was hired by NASA in 1961 . As Deputy Director of NASA 's Office of Manned Space Flight , and later as head of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office , Shea played a key role in shaping the course of the Apollo program , helping to lead NASA to the decision in favor of lunar orbit rendezvous and supporting " all up " testing of the Saturn V rocket . While sometimes causing controversy within the agency , Shea was remembered by his former colleague George Mueller as " one of the greatest systems engineers of our time " . 
 Deeply involved in the investigation of the 1967 Apollo 1 fire , Shea suffered a nervous breakdown as a result of the stress that he suffered . He was removed from his position and left NASA shortly afterwards . From 1968 until 1990 he worked as a senior manager at Raytheon in Lexington , Massachusetts , and thereafter became an adjunct professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT . While Shea served as a consultant for NASA on the redesign of the International Space Station in 1993 , he was forced to resign from the position due to health issues .

 Shea was born September 5 , 1925 , and grew up in the Bronx , the eldest son in a working @-@ class Irish Catholic family . His father worked as a mechanic on the New York City Subway . As a child , Shea had no interest in engineering ; he was a good runner and hoped to become a professional athlete . He attended a Catholic high school and graduated when he was only sixteen . 
 On graduating in 1943 , Shea enlisted in the U.S. Navy and enrolled in a program that would put him through college . He began his studies at Dartmouth College , later moving to MIT and finally to the University of Michigan , where he would remain until he earned his Doctorate in 1955 . In 1946 , he was commissioned as an Ensign in the Navy and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics . Shea went on to earn a MSc ( 1950 ) and a Ph.D. ( 1955 ) in Engineering Mechanics from the University of Michigan . While obtaining his doctorate , Shea found the time to teach at the university and to hold down a job at Bell Labs .

There he first worked as systems engineer on the radio guidance system of the Titan I intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) and then as the development and program manager on the inertial guidance system of the Titan II ICBM . Shea 's specialty was systems engineering , a new type of engineering developed in the 1950s that focused on the management and integration of large @-@ scale projects , turning the work of engineers and contractors into one functioning whole . He played a significant role in the Titan I project ; as George Mueller writes , " [ H ] e contributed a considerable amount of engineering innovation and project management skill and was directly responsible for the successful development of this pioneering guidance system . " In addition to Shea 's technical abilities , it quickly became obvious that he was also an excellent manager of people . Known for his quick intellect , he also endeared himself to his subordinates through small eccentricities such as his fondness for bad puns and habit of wearing red socks to important meetings . During the critical days of the Titan project Shea moved into the plant , sleeping on a cot in his office so as to be available at all hours if he was needed . 
 Having brought in the project on time and on budget , Shea established a reputation in the aerospace community . In 1961 he was offered and accepted a position with Space Technology Laboratories , a division of TRW Inc . , where he continued to work on ballistic missile systems .

 In December 1961 , NASA invited Shea to interview for the position of deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight ( OMSF ) . D. Brainerd Holmes , Director of the OMSF , had been searching for a deputy who could offer expertise in systems engineering , someone with the technical abilities to supervise the Apollo program as a whole . Shea was recommended by one of Holmes ' advisors , who had worked with him at Bell Labs . Although Shea had worked at Space Technology Labs for less than a year , he was captivated by the challenge offered by the NASA position . " I could see they needed good people in the space program , " he later said , " and I was kind of cocky in those days . "

 When Shea was hired by NASA , President John F. Kennedy 's commitment to landing men on the Moon was still only seven months old , and many of the major decisions that shaped the Apollo program were yet to be made . Foremost among these was the mode that NASA would use to land on the Moon . When Shea first began to consider the issue in 1962 , most NASA engineers and managers — including Wernher von Braun , the director of the Marshall Space Flight Center — favored either an approach called direct ascent , where the Apollo spacecraft would land on the Moon and return to the Earth as one unit , or Earth orbit rendezvous , where the spacecraft would be assembled while still in orbit around the Earth . However , dissenters such as John Houbolt , a Langley engineer , favored an approach that was then considered to be more risky : lunar orbit rendezvous , in which two spacecraft would be used . A command / service module ( CSM ) would remain in orbit around the Moon , while a lunar module would land on the Moon and return to dock with the CSM in lunar orbit , then be discarded . 
 In November 1961 , John Houbolt had sent a paper advocating lunar orbit rendezvous ( LOR ) to Robert Seamans , the deputy administrator of NASA . As Shea remembered , " Seamans gave a copy of Houbolt 's letter to Brainerd Holmes [ the director of OMSF ] . Holmes put the letter on my desk and said : Figure it out . " Shea became involved in the lunar orbit rendezvous decision as a result of this letter . While he began with a mild preference for earth orbit rendezvous , Shea " prided himself " , according to space historians Murray and Cox , " on going wherever the data took him " . In this case , the data took him to NASA 's Langley Research Center in Hampton , Virginia , where he met with John Houbolt and with the Space Task Group , and became convinced that LOR was an option worth considering . 
 Shea 's task now became to shepherd NASA to a firm decision on the issue . This task was complicated by the fact that he had to build consensus between NASA 's different centers — most notably the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston headed by Robert Gilruth , and the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Alabama , headed by Wernher von Braun . Relations between the centers were not good , and it was a major milestone in the progress of the Apollo program when von Braun and his team finally came to accept the superiority of the LOR concept . NASA announced its decision at a press conference on July 11 , 1962 , only six months after Shea had joined NASA . Space historian James Hansen concludes that Shea " played a major role in supporting Houbolt 's ideas and making the ... decision in favor of LOR " , while his former colleague George Mueller writes that " it is a tribute to Joe 's logic and leadership that he was able to build a consensus within the centers at a time when they were autonomous . " 
 During his time at the OMSF , Shea helped to resolve many of the other inevitable engineering debates and conflicts that cropped up during the development of the Apollo spacecraft . In May 1963 , he formed a Panel Review Board , bringing together representatives of the many committees that aimed to coordinate work between NASA centers . Under Shea 's leadership , this coordination became far more efficient . 
 = = = Program manager = = = 
 In October 1963 , Shea became the new manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office ( ASPO ) in Houston . Although technically a demotion , this new position gave Shea the responsibility for managing the design and construction of the Apollo command and lunar modules . Of particular concern to Shea was the performance of North American Aviation , the contractor responsible for the command module . As he later recounted : 
 I do not have a high opinion of North American and their motives in the early days . Their first program manager was a first @-@ class jerk .... There were spots of good guys , but it was just an ineffective organization . They had no discipline , no concept of change control . 
 It was Shea 's responsibility to bring that engineering discipline to North American and to NASA 's management of its contractors . His systems management experience served him well in his new post . In the coming years , any change to the design of the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Joe Shea . He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself — a looseleaf notebook , more than a hundred pages in length , that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made . Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings , Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions , instructions , and decisions . This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever @-@ expanding program . 
 Shea 's relationship with the engineers at North American was a difficult one . While Shea blamed North American 's management for the continuing difficulties in the development of the command module , project leader Harrison Storms felt that NASA itself was far from blameless . It had delayed in making key design decisions , and persisted in making significant changes to the design once construction had begun . While Shea did his part in attempting to control the change requests , Storms felt that he did not understand or sympathize with the inevitable problems involved in the day @-@ to @-@ day work of manufacturing . 
 Shea was a controversial figure even at the Manned Spacecraft Center . Not having been at Langley with the Space Task Group , he was considered an " outsider " by men such as flight director Chris Kraft . Kraft recalled that " the animosity between my people and Shea 's was intense " . Relations between Shea and other NASA centers were even more fraught . As the deputy director of OMSF , Shea had sought to extend the authority of NASA Headquarters over the fiercely independent NASA centers . This was particularly problematic when it came to the Marshall Space Flight Center , which had developed its own culture under Wernher von Braun . Von Braun 's philosophy of engineering differed from Shea 's , taking a consensual rather than top @-@ down approach . As one historian recounts , von Braun felt that " Shea had ' bitten off ' too much work and was going to ' wreck ' the centers engineering capabilities . " 
 The friction between Shea and Marshall , which had begun when Shea was at OMSF , continued after he moved to his new position . He became deeply involved in supporting George Mueller 's effort to impose the idea of " all up " testing of the Saturn V rocket on the unwilling engineers at Marshall . Von Braun 's approach to engineering was a conservative one , emphasizing the incremental testing of components . But the tight schedule of the Apollo program didn 't allow for this slow and careful process . What Mueller and Shea proposed was to test the Saturn V as one unit on its very first flight , and Marshall only reluctantly came to accept this approach in late 1963 . When later asked how he and Mueller had managed to sell the idea to von Braun , Shea responded that " we just told him that 's the way it 's going to be , finally . " 
 Shea 's role in resolving differences within NASA , and between NASA and its contractors , placed him in a position where criticism was inevitable . However , even Shea 's critics could not help but respect his engineering and management skills . Everyone who knew Shea considered him to be a brilliant engineer , and his time as manager at ASPO only served to solidify a reputation that had been formed during his time on the Titan project . Of Shea 's work in the mid @-@ 1960s , Murray and Cox write that " these were Joe Shea 's glory days , and whatever the swirl of opinions about this gifted , enigmatic man , he was taking an effort that had been foundering and driving it forward . " Shea 's work also won wider attention , bringing him public recognition that approached that accorded to Wernher von Braun or Chris Kraft . Kraft had appeared on the cover of Time in 1965 ; Time planned to offer Shea the same honor in February 1967 , the month in which the first manned Apollo mission was scheduled to occur .

 Problems with the Apollo command module continued through the testing phase . The review meeting for the first spacecraft intended for a manned mission took place on August 19 , 1966 . One issue of concern was the amount of Velcro in the cabin , a potential fire hazard in the pure @-@ oxygen atmosphere of the spacecraft , if there were to be a spark . As Shea later recounted : 
 And so the issue was brought up at the acceptance of the spacecraft , a long drawn @-@ out discussion . I got a little annoyed , and I said , " Look , there 's no way there 's going to be a fire in that spacecraft unless there 's a spark or the astronauts bring cigarettes aboard . We 're not going to let them smoke . " Well , I then issued orders at that meeting , " Go clean up the spacecraft . Be sure that all the fire rules are obeyed . " 
 Although the spacecraft passed its review , the crew finished the meeting by presenting Joe Shea with a picture of the three of them seated around a model of the capsule , heads bowed in prayer . The inscription was simple : 
 It isn 't that we don 't trust you , Joe , but this time we 've decided to go over your head . 
 On January 25 , 1967 , the Apollo 1 crew began a series of countdown tests in the spacecraft on the pad at Cape Kennedy . Although Shea had ordered his staff to direct North American to take action on the issue of flammable materials in the cabin , he had not supervised the issue directly , and little if any action had been taken . During pad testing , the spacecraft suffered a number of technical problems , including broken and static @-@ filled communications . Wally Schirra , the backup commander for the mission , suggested to Shea that he should go through the countdown test in the spacecraft with the crew in order to experience first @-@ hand the issues that they were facing . Although Shea seriously considered the idea , it proved to be unworkable because of the difficulties of hooking up a fourth communications loop for Shea . The hatch would have to be left open in order to run the extra wires out , and leaving the hatch open would make it impossible to run the emergency egress test that had been scheduled for the end of the day on the 27th . As Shea later told the press , joining the crew for the test " would have been highly irregular " . 
 A " plugs @-@ out " spacecraft test , simulating the launch countdown , took place on January 27 . While Shea was in Florida for the beginning of the test , he decided to leave before it concluded . He arrived back at his office in Houston at about 5 : 30 p.m. CST . At 5 : 31 p.m. CST ( 6 : 31 p.m. EST ) a massive fire broke out in the Apollo command module . Unable to escape , the three astronauts inside the spacecraft — Gus Grissom , Ed White and Roger Chaffee — were killed . 
 = = = = Investigation = = = = 
 Immediately after the fire , Shea and his ASPO colleagues at Houston boarded a NASA plane to the Kennedy Space Center . They landed at about 1 : 00 a.m. , only five hours after the fire had broken out . At a meeting that morning with Robert Gilruth , George Mueller and George Low , Shea helped to determine the individuals who would be on the NASA review board looking into the causes of the fire . Additionally , he persuaded George Mueller , head of NASA 's Office of Manned Space Flight , to allow him to act as Mueller 's deputy in Florida , supervising the progress of the investigation . 
 Named to the advisory group chosen to support the review board , Shea threw himself into the investigation , working eighty @-@ hour weeks . Although the precise source of ignition was never found , it soon became clear that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire , probably sparked by a chafed wire . What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility . NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation . By contrast , North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space , in which almost any material — including Velcro , with which the cabin was filled — would instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark . Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility , Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he , personally , was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts . For years after the fire , he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home . 
 = = = = Breakdown = = = = 
 The pressure of the investigation took a psychological toll on Shea . He had trouble sleeping and began to resort to barbiturates and alcohol in order to help him cope . Shea was not the only NASA employee who found the aftermath of the fire difficult to handle : Robert Seamans wrote that " key people from Houston would fly up to Washington to testify and literally sob all the way on the plane " , and a man who worked under Shea suffered a nervous breakdown and was reportedly taken to a mental hospital in a straitjacket . A few weeks after the fire , Shea 's colleagues began to notice that he too was behaving erratically . Chris Kraft , whose father had suffered from schizophrenia , later related Shea 's behavior in one meeting : 
 Joe Shea got up and started calmly with a report on the state of the investigation . But within a minute , he was rambling , and in another thirty seconds , he was incoherent . I looked at him and saw my father , in the grip of dementia praecox . It was horrifying and fascinating at the same time . 
 NASA administrator James Webb became increasingly worried about Shea 's mental state . Specifically , he was concerned that Shea might not be able to deal with the hostile questioning that he would receive from the congressional inquiry into the Apollo 1 fire . Senator Walter Mondale had accused NASA engineers of " criminal negligence " with regard to the design and construction of the Apollo command module , and it was reliably expected that Shea would be in the firing line . In March , Webb sent Robert Seamans and Charles Berry , NASA 's head physician , to speak with Shea and ask him to take an extended voluntary leave of absence . This would , they hoped , protect him from being called to testify . A press release was already prepared , but Shea refused , threatening to resign rather than take leave . As a compromise , he agreed to meet with a psychiatrist and to abide by an independent assessment of his psychological fitness . Yet this approach to removing Shea from his position was also unsuccessful . As one of his friends later recounted : 
 The psychiatrists came back saying , ' He 's so smart , he 's so intelligent ! ' Here Joe was , ready to kill himself , but he could still outsmart the psychiatrists . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 Finally Shea 's superiors were forced to take a more direct approach . On April 7 it was announced that Shea would be moving to NASA Headquarters in Washington , D.C. , where he would serve as George Mueller 's deputy at the Office of Manned Space Flight . He was replaced as chief of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office by George Low . While Shea had already acted as Mueller 's de facto deputy in Florida during the investigation , the reality of this permanent posting was very different . When Shea 's reassignment was announced , one of his friends gave an anonymous interview to Time magazine in which he said that " if Joe stays in Washington , it 'll be a promotion . If he leaves in three or four months , you 'll know this move amounted to being fired . " 
 Shea himself accepted the reassignment only reluctantly , feeling that " it was as if NASA was trying to hide me from the Congress for what I might have said " . Once in the job , he grew increasingly dissatisfied with a posting that he considered to be a " non @-@ job " , later commenting that " I don 't understand why , after everything I had done for the program ... I was only one that was removed . That 's the end of the program for me . " Only six months after the fire , and some two months after taking his new position , Shea left NASA in order to become a Vice President at the Polaroid Corporation in Waltham , Massachusetts . He had not been called to testify before the congressional inquiry into the fire . 
 = = Post @-@ NASA career = = 
 In 1968 , Shea took a position at Raytheon in Lexington , Massachusetts . He would remain with the company until his retirement in 1990 , serving as Senior Vice President for Engineering from 1981 through 1990 . After leaving Raytheon , Shea became an adjunct professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT . 
 In February 1993 , NASA administrator Daniel Goldin appointed Shea to the chairmanship of a technical review board convened to oversee the redesign of the troubled International Space Station project . However , Shea was hospitalized shortly after his appointment . By April he was well enough to attend a meeting where the design team formally presented the preliminary results of its studies , but his behavior at the meeting again called his capacities into question . As The Washington Post reported : 
 Shea made a rambling , sometimes barely audible two @-@ hour presentation that left many of those present speculating about his ability to do the job . A longtime friend said , " That 's not the real Joe Shea . He is normally incisive and well @-@ organized . " 
 On the day following the meeting , Shea offered his resignation , becoming instead a special advisor to Daniel Goldin . NASA reported that he had resigned due to health reasons . However , The Scientist offered a different interpretation , quoting sources who speculated that the bluntness of his speech , including criticisms of Goldin , may have been controversial in NASA circles . 
 Shea died on February 14 , 1999 , at his home in Weston , Massachusetts . He was survived by his wife Carol , six daughters , and one son . 
 = USS Wisconsin ( BB @-@ 9 ) = 
 USS Wisconsin ( BB @-@ 9 ) , an Illinois @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleship , was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the 30th state . She was the third and final member of her class to be built . Her keel was laid down in February 1897 at the Union Iron Works in San Francisco , and she was launched in November 1898 . The completed ship was commissioned into the fleet in February 1901 . The ship was armed with a main battery of four 13 @-@ inch ( 330 mm ) guns and she had a top speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . 
 Wisconsin served as the flagship of the Pacific Fleet from her commissioning to 1903 ; during this period , she made one long distance cruise to American Samoa in late 1901 . In 1903 , she was transferred to the Asiatic Fleet , where she served as the Northern Squadron flagship . She returned to the United States in late 1906 , where she was overhauled extensively . In July 1908 , she joined the Great White Fleet for the second leg of its cruise around the world , which lasted until February 1909 . The ship remained in service with the Atlantic Fleet until early 1910 , when she was reduced to reserve status . 
 The vessel was employed as a training ship starting in 1912 , primarily for cadets from the US Naval Academy . After the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , Wisconsin 's training duties expanded to engine room personnel . She was also assigned to the Coast Battleship Patrol Squadron . She took part in a naval review in December 1918 after the war ended . She served briefly with the fleet in 1919 , though by May 1920 , she was decommissioned . The old battleship , thoroughly obsolete by this time , was sold for scrap in January 1922 and broken up . 
 = = Description = = 
 Wisconsin was 373 feet 10 inches ( 113 @.@ 94 m ) long overall and had a beam of 72 ft 3 in ( 22 @.@ 02 m ) and a draft of 23 ft 8 in ( 7 @.@ 21 m ) . She displaced 11 @,@ 653 long tons ( 11 @,@ 840 t ) as designed and up to 12 @,@ 250 long tons ( 12 @,@ 450 t ) at full load . The ship was powered by two @-@ shaft triple @-@ expansion steam engines rated at 16 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 000 kW ) and eight coal @-@ fired fire @-@ tube boilers , generating a top speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . As built , she was fitted with heavy military masts , but these were replaced by cage masts in 1909 . She had a crew of 531 officers and enlisted men , which increased to 690 – 713 . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of four 13 in ( 330 mm ) / 35 caliber guns guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline , one forward and aft . The secondary battery consisted of fourteen 6 in ( 152 mm ) / 40 caliber Mark IV guns , which were placed in casemates in the hull . For close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats , she carried sixteen 6 @-@ pounder guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and six 1 @-@ pounder guns . As was standard for capital ships of the period , Wisconsin carried four 21 in ( 530 mm ) torpedo tubes in deck mounted torpedo launchers . 
 Wisconsin 's main armored belt was 16 @.@ 5 in ( 419 mm ) thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and 4 in ( 102 mm ) elsewhere . The main battery gun turrets had 14 @-@ inch ( 360 mm ) thick faces , and the supporting barbettes had 15 in ( 380 mm ) of armor plating on their exposed sides . Armor that was 6 in thick protected the secondary battery . The conning tower had 10 in ( 250 mm ) thick sides .

 The keel for Wisconsin was laid down on 9 February 1897 at the Union Iron Works in San Francisco . She was launched on 26 November 1898 and was commissioned into the fleet on 4 February 1901 . The ship steamed out of San Francisco on 12 March for initial training in Magdalena Bay , Mexico from 17 March to 11 April . She was back in San Francisco on 15 April for repairs , which lasted until 28 May . She then left for Port Orchard , Washington , arriving on 1 June . Wisconsin stayed there for nine days before returning to San Francisco . Later that month , she joined the battleships Oregon and Iowa , the cruiser Philadelphia , and the torpedo boat Farragut for a tour of the west coast of the United States . They arrived in Port Angeles , Washington on 29 June and proceeded to Port Whatcom , Washington on 2 July , where they took part in Independence Day celebrations . The following day , they returned to Port Angeles and took part in training exercises , which lasted to mid @-@ July . 
 Wisconsin entered the drydock at the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton , Washington on 23 July for repairs that lasted until 14 October . She then sailed to Honolulu , Hawaii , arriving on 23 October . There , she took on coal and continued on to American Samoa , conducting gunnery training while en route . She arrived in Tutuila on 5 November , and stayed with the collier Abarenda and the hospital ship Solace for about two weeks before steaming to Apia in German Samoa . Wisconsin left the island on 21 November for Hawaii , from which she continued on to Central America . She arrived in Acapulco , Mexico on 25 December and remained there for three days to coal . She made visits to Callao , Peru and Valparaiso , Chile before returning to Acapulco on 26 February 1902 . The ship then conducted a wide variety training exercises in Magdalena Bay and <unk> Bay from 5 to 22 March , before steaming up the west coast of the United States , stopping in Coronado , San Francisco , and Port Angeles . She arrived in the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 4 June for repairs that lasted until 11 August . 
 The ship took part in gunnery training off Tacoma and Seattle before additional maintenance at Puget Sound on 29 August . Wisconsin departed Washington on 12 September bound for Panama — then still part of Colombia — to protect American interests in the country . She was by this time serving as the flagship of the Pacific Squadron , under Rear Admiral Silas Casey . The Thousand Days ' War was being waged in Panama , and so Casey brought representatives from the two sides aboard Wisconsin for negotiations that ultimately ended the conflict . The ship left Panama on 22 November and steamed back to San Francisco , arriving on 5 December . On the 9th , Casey transferred his flag to the armored cruiser New York . Wisconsin then conducted gunnery training until 17 December , followed by another period in drydock at Puget Sound from 20 December to 13 May 1903 . She was then assigned to the Asiatic Fleet ; she coaled in Honolulu before arriving in Yokohama , Japan on 12 June . Rear Admiral P. H. Cooper , the commander of the Northern Squadron , Asiatic Fleet hoisted his flag aboard Wisconsin on 15 June . 
 Wisconsin spent the next three years in the Asiatic Fleet ; during this time , her routine consisted of operations off north China and Japan in the summer and in the Philippines in the winter . She visited numerous East Asian ports , including Kobe , Yokohama , Nagasaki in Japan and Amoy , Shanghai , Chefoo , Nanking , and Taku in China . The ship left the Asiatic Fleet on 20 September 1906 when she departed Yokohama , bound for Honolulu . After coaling there from 3 to 8 October , she proceeded to San Francisco , arriving on 18 October . Wisconsin spent a week there before steaming north to Puget Sound , where she was decommissioned on 16 November for a lengthy overhaul that lasted until the end of April 1908 . She then steamed south to San Francisco , where she arrived on 6 May to take part in a naval review there . She was back in Puget Sound on 21 May to have new fire control equipment installed ; the work lasted until 22 June . 
 = = = Great White Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet = = = 
 The ship then steamed back down to San Francisco in early July . There , she joined the Great White Fleet , which had departed Hampton Roads , Virginia , the previous year on the first leg of its global cruise . The Great White Fleet then began its crossing of the Pacific , with a visit to Hawaii on the way . Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne , Sydney , and Auckland . After leaving Australia , the fleet turned north for the Philippines , stopping in Manila , before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama . Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November . The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean ; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said , Egypt . The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar , where an international fleet of British , Russian , French , and Dutch warships greeted the Americans . The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909 . There , they conducted a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt . 
 Wisconsin steamed out of Hampton Roads on 6 March for Portsmouth , New Hampshire , arriving on the 9th . There , she entered the drydock for repairs and modifications , including a new gray paint scheme . After returning to service in June , she was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet , and she joined her unit in Hampton Roads at the end of the month . She immediate steamed back north for Portland , Maine , where she participated in Independence Day celebrations on 4 July . Wisconsin rejoined the fleet in Hampton Roads on 6 August for gunnery training off the Virginia Capes . Routine maintenance was performed at Hampton Roads during this period . In late September , she steamed to New York for the Hudson @-@ Fulton Celebration . The celebration saw an international fleet of warships from Germany , Britain , France , Italy , and other countries join the Atlantic Fleet to commemorate Henry Hudson 's discovery of the Hudson River . Wisconsin left the ceremonies on 5 October for repairs at Portsmouth , which lasted from 7 October to 28 November . She then returned to Hampton Roads , by way of Newport , Rhode Island , where she embarked sailors assigned to the Atlantic Fleet . 
 The ship conducted exercises with the rest of the fleet off the Virginia Capes until the middle of December , when she departed for New York , where she would spend Christmas and New Year 's Day . In early January 1910 , she steamed south to Cuban waters for exercises . During this period , which lasted from 12 January to 19 March , she was based in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . After the conclusion of the exercises , Wisconsin made visits to Tompkinsville , New York , and New Orleans , Louisiana . On 22 April , she arrived back in New York , where she unloaded her stocks of ammunition , before proceeding to the Portsmouth Navy Yard . There , she was placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet . She was transferred to Philadelphia in April 1912 and later that year she participated in a naval review , which was held off Yonkers , New York . The ship then returned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet ; she was placed in ordinary on 31 October 1913 . In early 1915 , Wisconsin was assigned to the United States Naval Academy Practice Squadron , along with the battleships Missouri and Ohio . The three ships made a cruise to the Pacific coast via the recently @-@ completed Panama Canal ; Wisconsin was the third battleship to transit the canal since its opening . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 Wisconsin continued in her service as a training ship into 1917 ; she was in the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 6 April when the United States declared war on Germany , entering World War I. On the 8th , the ship began to receive men from the Naval Militia to flesh out her crew . She was placed in full commission on 23 April and was assigned to the Coast Battleship Patrol Squadron , along with Missouri and Ohio , commanded by Commander David F. Sellers . On 6 May , Wisconsin steamed to the Virginia Capes , arriving in Yorktown , Virginia the next day . From then to early August , the ship was employed as a training ship for engine room personnel in the Chesapeake Bay area . She then took part in squadron exercises from 13 to 19 August ; these included the battleships Kearsarge , Alabama , Illinois , Kentucky , Ohio , Missouri , and Maine . Wisconsin then proceeded to Port Jefferson , New York for additional exercises . 
 The ship then steamed to the York River in the western Chesapeake in early October , followed by a short period in drydock at the Philadelphia Navy Yard from 30 October to 18 December . She returned to the Chesapeake , where she remained into early 1918 . More repairs at Philadelphia followed from 13 May to 3 June , after which she steamed to Annapolis . While en route , she received orders to cruise close to shore , as the German submarine U @-@ 151 had been operating in the area since 23 May , and had sunk several ships . Wisconsin reached Annapolis on 7 June , having stopped in the Delaware River to wait for U @-@ 151 to depart . A contingent of 175 midshipmen came aboard Wisconsin on 8 June for a training cruise to the Chesapeake . On 29 August she returned to Annapolis and disembarked the midshipmen before returning to Yorktown the next day . There , she took on 217 men for another round of training . On 11 November , Germany signed the Armistice that ended the fighting in Europe . Wisconsin continued in her training ship duties until 20 December , when she was sent to New York for a naval review for Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt on 26 December . 
 Following the German surrender in November 1918 , most of the battleships of the Atlantic Fleet were used as transports to ferry American soldiers back from France . Wisconsin and her sisters were not so employed , however , owing to their short range and small size , which would not permit sufficient additional accommodations . Wisconsin instead steamed to Cuba for training with the Atlantic Fleet into 1919 . She went on a midshipmen training cruise to the Caribbean in mid @-@ 1919 . On 15 May 1920 , Wisconsin was decommissioned ; she was reclassified as BB @-@ 9 on 17 July . She was eventually sold on 26 January 1922 and broken up for scrap . 
 = Muntz Street = 
 Muntz Street is the popular name of a former association football stadium situated in the Small Heath district of Birmingham , England , taken from the street on which it stood . During its lifetime the ground was known as Coventry Road ; the name " Muntz Street " is a more recent adoption . It was the ground at which the teams of Birmingham City F.C. – under the club 's former names of Small Heath Alliance , Small Heath and Birmingham – played their home games for nearly 30 years . It also served as the headquarters of the Small Heath Athletic Club . 
 The Muntz Street ground , then situated on Birmingham 's eastern edge and bordered on two sides by farmland , opened in 1877 . It was a field with terracing round it which provided standing accommodation for roughly 10 @,@ 000 spectators . A wooden stand was built and the terracing raised to expand the capacity to around 30 @,@ 000 , but eventually it proved too small for the football club 's needs . They built a new stadium nearer the city centre , St Andrew 's , which hosted its first game in December 1906 . Muntz Street , by then in a heavily built @-@ up area , was demolished in 1907 and the land used for housing . The street of the same name remains .

 Small Heath Alliance Football Club , founded in 1875 , played their first home games on waste ground off Arthur Street , in the Bordesley Green district of Birmingham , very near the site where the club 's St Andrew 's stadium would be built some thirty years later . In 1876 , they made a temporary move to a fenced @-@ off field in Ladypool Road , Sparkbrook , with a capacity estimated at 3 @,@ 000 ; because the field was enclosed , admission could be charged . A year later they moved again , to a field in Small Heath , rented for an initial £ 5 a year from the family of Sam <unk> , a Small Heath player . The field had a capacity of 10 @,@ 000 spectators , and was situated on the eastern edge of Birmingham 's built @-@ up area , just north of the main road to Coventry . It was bordered on two sides by developed streets , Muntz Street on the western side , Wright Street to the south ; the other two sides of the enclosure adjoined farmland . 
 When it first opened , the ground had few facilities for either player or spectator . Uncovered terracing surrounded the pitch , and a hut acted as the players ' changing room . A small but well @-@ appointed covered wooden stand was built on the Coventry Road side , and over the years the terracing was enlarged to raise the capacity to around 30 @,@ 000 . In 1895 , the football club bought the lease to the ground , which had 11 years remaining , for a sum of £ 275 . Two years later , they paid £ 90 to their near neighbours , Aston Villa Football Club , for an old grandstand from Villa 's former Wellington Road ground in Perry Barr . The club transported it piece by piece , and re @-@ erected it as a terrace cover behind the goal at the Muntz Street end . No other major improvements were made , nor did the club ever move their administrative offices to the site , instead maintaining premises in Corporation Street , in Birmingham city centre . 
 Muntz Street was readily accessible by public transport . In the early years , horse @-@ drawn buses ran along the Coventry Road , linking Small Heath with the city centre and with other nearby districts . In 1882 , the building of a tramline along the Coventry Road to Small Heath Park was authorised , and four years later , the Coventry Road steam tramway route was opened to a terminus near Dora Road , a few yards past the ground . In the early years of the 20th century , this line was converted for use by electric trams . 
 Contemporary reports referred to the ground throughout its lifetime as Coventry Road . Writer and researcher Steve <unk> suggests that the Muntz Street name may have been adopted to distinguish it from St Andrew 's , which was also built just off the Coventry Road . 
 = = Club matches = = 
 The first game at Muntz Street , a friendly match against <unk> College , was played on 11 September 1877 . Small Heath Alliance won 5 – 0 , in front of " a handful " of spectators who contributed gate receipts of 6s 8d . This marked the start of a run of 22 games unbeaten at the new ground . The playing surface was notorious for its poor quality – bumpy and stony – and was referred to locally as the " celery trenches " . The first meeting between Small Heath and Aston Villa – who went on to become the club 's major rivals – took place in 1879 ; it resulted in a 1 – 0 home win , after which the Villa players described the pitch as " only suitable for pot @-@ holing " . In 1883 , Wednesbury Old Athletic paid Small Heath £ 5 to switch the venue of a Walsall Cup tie away from Muntz Street ; the club took the money , won the match and went on to win the competition , their first ever silverware . Nine years later , The Wednesday offered £ 200 to switch venues in a second @-@ round FA Cup tie ; the money was accepted , but without the success . 
 Events surrounding the February 1905 First Division match with Aston Villa highlighted the ground 's inadequacies . The official attendance was given as 28 @,@ 000 , though with the gates closed before kick @-@ off , thousands climbed over walls or forced entrances in order to gain admission , and the actual attendance is estimated at anything up to 35 @,@ 000 . The Birmingham Daily Mail reported " a constant stream of vehicles to the ground , while the trams were disgorging their freights at Muntz Street every two or three minutes . " Inside , " the swaying of the mass of spectators rendered the placing of additional supports against the barriers a necessary precaution " , and children were passed overhead and deposited on the pitch for their own safety . The following Monday the same newspaper commented that had space been available , another ten or fifteen thousand spectators might well have attended , as " hundreds of people found the doors closed against them , and probably there were thousands who would not go to the ground in view of the inevitable crush . " The size of the crowd preferring to attend the same day 's Birmingham & District League match between the two clubs ' reserve teams at Villa Park – at least 3 @,@ 000 spectators – lent support to that view . 
 = = Move to St Andrew 's = = 
 A month later the club changed its name to Birmingham Football Club , to reflect its position as the only Football League club in the city . Football as a spectator sport was becoming increasing popular : a Birmingham Daily Post editorial pointed out that " Birmingham has not escaped this great wave of popularity , and the club bearing the name of the city has found itself compelled to seek a new home . Its old one at Small Heath was quite inadequate for the requirements of an important match " . 
 The rent had risen to £ 300 a year , and the landlords refused to sell the freehold , to renew the lease , which was nearing expiry , or to allow extensions to be made to the ground , which was by then surrounded by tightly @-@ packed housing . The directors estimated that remaining at Muntz Street was losing the club as much as £ 2000 a year in revenue ; the March 1906 cup @-@ tie against Newcastle United produced receipts of £ 900 from a crowd restricted to 25 @,@ 000 , with " probably 60 @,@ 000 people anxious to attend " . Club director Harry Morris identified a site three @-@ quarters of a mile ( 1 km ) nearer the city centre where a new ground could be built , on wet , sloping wasteland where a disused brickworks stood , near the railway and St Andrew 's Church . Within twelve months of a 21 @-@ year lease being signed , the new ground , which became known as St Andrew 's , was ready for use . 
 The last game at Muntz Street was played on 22 December 1906 . Birmingham beat Bury 3 – 1 in the First Division in front of some 10 @,@ 000 spectators . The last goal was scored by Arthur <unk> , and the Birmingham Daily Post described how 
 At the conclusion of the match the band played " Auld Lang Syne " , and the crowd silently left the ground which has been the home of the club for so many years and the scene of many brilliant victories and many heartbreaking defeats , and of an uphill struggle from which the club , thanks to the courage of the directors , has at length emerged triumphant . 
 Within months the ground had been demolished , the land cleared and housing built in what became Swanage Road ; no plaque commemorates the site .

 Despite the apparently poor quality of pitch and facilities the Birmingham County Football Association XI , comprising players from teams in the Birmingham area , played several representative football matches at Muntz Street . The ground twice hosted matches against the London Football Association , and between 1898 and 1906 four matches were played against teams representing the Scottish Football Association . 
 Small Heath Athletic Club ( later called Small Heath Harriers ) established its headquarters at the Muntz Street ground from the club 's foundation in 1891 . Though primarily a cross @-@ country and road @-@ racing club , they also participated in track and field athletics , and during the summer months the athletes were allowed to train on the football pitch .

 The Stoney Littleton Long Barrow ( also known as the Bath Tumulus and the Wellow Tumulus ) is a Neolithic chambered tomb with multiple burial chambers , located near the village of Wellow in the English county of Somerset . It is an example of the Severn @-@ Cotswold tomb and was scheduled as an ancient monument in 1882 . It was one of the initial monuments included when the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882 became law . 
 The chambered long barrow was built around 3500 BC . Excavations in the early 19th century uncovered bones from several individuals . The stone structure is about 30 metres ( 98 ft ) in length and contains a 12 @.@ 8 metres ( 42 ft ) long gallery with three pairs of side chambers and an end chamber .

It is surrounded by a rectangular grass area accessed via a stile and footpath from a car park at Stoney Littleton Farm .

 Chambered long barrows were constructed during the Neolithic between 4000 and 2500 BC for the ritual inhumation of the dead . Stoney Littleton Long Barrow was probably constructed around 3500 BC . 
 The tomb was first opened around 1760 by a local farmer to obtain stone for road building . The site was excavated by John Skinner and Richard Hoare in 1816 @-@ 17 , who gained the entry through the hole which was made previously . The excavation revealed the bones ( some burned ) of several individuals . The mound was restored in 1858 by Thomas Joliffe . Some of the artefacts from the excavations are in the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery . 
 It was scheduled as an ancient monument in 1882 . Since 1884 the Stoney Littleton Long Barrow has been in state care , and is now managed by English Heritage who have provided an information board at the site . Further conservation work and a geophysical survey were carried out in 1999 and 2000 by the Cotswold Archaeological Trust .

 = James Bond = 
 The James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming , who featured him in twelve novels and two short @-@ story collections . Since Fleming 's death in 1964 , eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations : Kingsley Amis , Christopher Wood , John Gardner , Raymond Benson , Sebastian Faulks , Jeffery Deaver , William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz . The latest novel is Trigger Mortis by Anthony Horowitz , published in September 2015 . Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond , and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character , Moneypenny . 
 The character has also been adapted for television , radio , comic strip , video games and film . The films are the longest continually running and the third @-@ highest @-@ grossing film series to date , which started in 1962 with Dr. No , starring Sean Connery as Bond . As of 2016 , there have been twenty @-@ four films in the Eon Productions series . The most recent Bond film , Spectre ( 2015 ) , stars Daniel Craig in his fourth portrayal of Bond ; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series . There have also been two independent productions of Bond films : Casino Royale ( a 1967 spoof ) and Never Say Never Again ( a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon @-@ produced film , Thunderball ) . 
 The Bond films are renowned for a number of features , including the musical accompaniment , with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions , and two wins . Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond 's cars , his guns , and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch . The films are also noted for Bond 's relationships with various women , who are sometimes referred to as " Bond girls " .

 = = = Creation and inspiration = = = 
 As the central figure for his works , Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond , an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service , commonly known as MI6 . Bond was also known by his code number , 007 , and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander . 
 Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II , admitting that Bond " was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war " . Among those types were his brother , Peter , who had been involved in behind @-@ the @-@ lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war . Aside from Fleming 's brother , a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond 's make up , including Conrad O 'Brien @-@ ffrench , Patrick Dalzel @-@ Job and Bill " Biffy " Dunderdale . 
 The name James Bond came from that of the American ornithologist James Bond , a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies . Fleming , a keen birdwatcher himself , had a copy of Bond 's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist 's wife that " It struck me that this brief , unromantic , Anglo @-@ Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed , and so a second James Bond was born " . He further explained that : 
 When I wrote the first one in 1953 , I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull , uninteresting man to whom things happened ; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument ... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God , ( James Bond ) is the dullest name I ever heard . 
 On another occasion , Fleming said : " I wanted the simplest , dullest , plainest @-@ sounding name I could find , ' James Bond ' was much better than something more interesting , like ' Peregrine Carruthers ' . Exotic things would happen to and around him , but he would be a neutral figure — an anonymous , blunt instrument wielded by a government department . " 
 Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself and in Casino Royale , Vesper Lynd remarks , " Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael , but there is something cold and ruthless . " Likewise , in Moonraker , Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is " certainly good @-@ looking ... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way . That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow . Much the same bones . But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth , and the eyes were cold . " 
 Fleming also endowed Bond with many of his own traits , including sharing the same golf handicap , the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries . Bond 's tastes are also often taken from Fleming 's own as was his behaviour , with Bond 's love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming 's own . Fleming used his experiences of his espionage career and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing , including using names of school friends , acquaintances , relatives and lovers throughout his books . 
 It was not until the penultimate novel , You Only Live Twice , that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background . The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery 's depiction of Bond affected Fleming 's interpretation of the character , to give Bond both a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories . In a fictional obituary , purportedly published in The Times , Bond 's parents were given as Andrew Bond , from the village of Glencoe , Scotland , and Monique Delacroix , from the canton of Vaud , Switzerland . Fleming did not provide Bond 's date of birth , but John Pearson 's fictional biography of Bond , James Bond : The Authorized Biography of 007 , gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920 , while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921 .

 Whilst serving in the Naval Intelligence Division , Fleming had planned to become an author and had told a friend , " I am going to write the spy story to end all spy stories . " On 17 February 1952 , he began writing his first James Bond novel , Casino Royale at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica , where he wrote all his Bond novels during the months of January and February each year . He started the story shortly before his wedding to his pregnant girlfriend , Ann Charteris , in order to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials . 
 After completing the manuscript for Casino Royale , Fleming showed the manuscript to his friend ( and later editor ) William Plomer to read . Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers , Jonathan Cape , who did not like it as much . Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming 's older brother Peter , an established travel writer . Between 1953 and 1966 , two years after his death , twelve novels and two short @-@ story collections were published , with the last two books – The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights – published posthumously . All the books were published in the UK through Jonathan Cape .

 After Fleming 's death a continuation novel , Colonel Sun , was written by Kingsley Amis ( as Robert Markham ) and published in 1968 . Amis had already written a literary study of Fleming 's Bond novels in his 1965 work The James Bond Dossier . Although novelizations of two of the Eon Productions Bond films appeared in print , James Bond , The Spy Who Loved Me and James Bond and Moonraker , both written by screenwriter Christopher Wood , the series of novels did not continue until the 1980s . In 1981 the thriller writer John Gardner picked up the series with Licence Renewed . Gardner went on to write sixteen Bond books in total ; two of the books he wrote – Licence to Kill and GoldenEye – were novelizations of Eon Productions films of the same name . Gardner moved the Bond series into the 1980s , although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them . In 1996 Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health . 
 In 1996 the American author Raymond Benson became the author of the Bond novels . Benson had previously been the author of The James Bond Bedside Companion , first published in 1984 . By the time he moved on to other , non @-@ Bond related projects in 2002 , Benson had written six Bond novels , three novelizations and three short stories . 
 After a gap of six years , Sebastian Faulks was commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to write a new Bond novel , which was released on 28 May 2008 , the 100th anniversary of Fleming 's birth . The book — titled Devil May Care — was published in the UK by Penguin Books and by Doubleday in the US . American writer Jeffery Deaver was then commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to produce Carte Blanche , which was published on 26 May 2011 . The book updated Bond into a post @-@ 9 / 11 agent , independent of MI5 or MI6 . On 26 September 2013 Solo , written by William Boyd , was published , set in 1969 . In October 2014 it was announced that Anthony Horowitz was to write a Bond continuation novel .

The episode aired live on 21 October 1954 and starred Barry Nelson as " Card Sense " James Bond and Peter Lorre as Le Chiffre . The novel was adapted for American audiences to show Bond as an American agent working for " Combined Intelligence " , while the character Felix Leiter — American in the novel — became British onscreen and was renamed " Clarence Leiter " . 
 In 1973 a BBC documentary Omnibus : The British Hero featured Christopher Cazenove playing a number of such title characters ( e.g. Richard Hannay and Bulldog Drummond ) . The documentary included James Bond in dramatised scenes from Goldfinger — notably featuring 007 being threatened with the novel 's circular saw , rather than the film 's laser beam — and Diamonds Are Forever .

 The BBC have adapted five of the Fleming novels for broadcast : in 1990 You Only Live Twice was adapted into a 90 @-@ minute radio play for BBC Radio 4 with Michael Jayston playing James Bond . The production was repeated a number of times between 2008 and 2011 . On 24 May 2008 BBC Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation of Dr. No . The actor Toby Stephens , who played Bond villain Gustav Graves in the Eon Productions version of Die Another Day , played Bond , while Dr. No was played by David Suchet . Following its success , a second story was adapted and on 3 April 2010 BBC Radio 4 broadcast Goldfinger with Stephens again playing Bond . Sir Ian McKellen was Goldfinger and Stephens ' Die Another Day co @-@ star Rosamund Pike played Pussy Galore . The play was adapted from Fleming 's novel by Archie Scottney and was directed by Martin Jarvis . In 2012 the novel From Russia , with Love was dramatized for Radio 4 ; it featured a full cast again starring Stephens as Bond . In May 2014 Stephens again played Bond , in On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , with Alfred Molina as Blofeld , and Joanna Lumley as Irma Bunt .

 In 1957 the Daily Express approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips , offering him £ 1 @,@ 500 per novel and a share of takings from syndication . After initial reluctance , Fleming , who felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing , agreed . To aid the Daily Express in illustrating Bond , Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of how he believed James Bond looked . The illustrator , John McLusky , however , felt that Fleming 's 007 looked too " outdated " and " pre @-@ war " and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look . The first strip , Casino Royale was published from 7 July 1958 to 13 December 1958 and was written by Anthony Hern and illustrated by John McLusky . 
 Most of the Bond novels and short stories have since been adapted for illustration , as well as Kingsley Amis 's Colonel Sun ; the works were written by Henry Gammidge or Jim Lawrence with Yaroslav Horak replacing McClusky as artist in 1966 . After the Fleming and Amis material had been adapted , original stories were produced , continuing in the Daily Express and Sunday Express until May 1977 . 
 Several comic book adaptations of the James Bond films have been published through the years : at the time of Dr. No 's release in October 1962 , a comic book adaptation of the screenplay , written by Norman J. <unk> , was published in Britain as part of the Classics Illustrated anthology series . It was later reprinted in the United States by DC Comics as part of its Showcase anthology series , in January 1963 . This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high @-@ profile American comic . It was also one of the earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds ( some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market ) . 
 With the release of the 1981 film For Your Eyes Only , Marvel Comics published a two @-@ issue comic book adaptation of the film . When Octopussy was released in the cinemas in 1983 , Marvel published an accompanying comic ; Eclipse also produced a one @-@ off comic for Licence to Kill , although Timothy Dalton refused to allow his likeness to be used .

 In 1967 Casino Royale was adapted into a parody Bond film starring David Niven as Sir James Bond and Ursula Andress as Vesper Lynd . Niven had been Fleming 's preference for the role of Bond . The result of a court case in the High Court in London in 1963 allowed Kevin McClory to produce a remake of Thunderball titled Never Say Never Again in 1983 . The film , produced by Jack Schwartzman 's Taliafilm production company and starring Sean Connery as Bond , was not part of the Eon series of Bond films . In 1997 the Sony Corporation acquired all or some of McClory 's rights in an undisclosed deal , which were then subsequently acquired by MGM , whilst on 4 December 1997 , MGM announced that the company had purchased the rights to Never Say Never Again from Taliafilm .

 The " James Bond Theme " was written by Monty Norman and was first orchestrated by the John Barry Orchestra for 1962 's Dr. No , although the actual authorship of the music has been a matter of controversy for many years . In 2001 , Norman won £ 30 @,@ 000 in libel damages from the The Sunday Times newspaper , which suggested that Barry was entirely responsible for the composition . The theme , as written by Norman and arranged by Barry , was described by another Bond film composer , David Arnold , as " bebop @-@ swing vibe coupled with that vicious , dark , distorted electric guitar , definitely an instrument of rock ' n ' roll ... it represented everything about the character you would want : It was cocky , swaggering , confident , dark , dangerous , suggestive , sexy , unstoppable . And he did it in two minutes . " Barry composed the scores for eleven Bond films and had an uncredited contribution to Dr. No with his arrangement of the Bond Theme . 
 A Bond film staple are the theme songs heard during their title sequences sung by well @-@ known popular singers . Several of the songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for Original Song , including Paul McCartney 's " Live and Let Die " , Carly Simon 's " Nobody Does It Better " , Sheena Easton 's " For Your Eyes Only " , Adele 's " Skyfall " , and Sam Smith 's " Writing 's on the Wall " .

 For the first five novels , Fleming armed Bond with a Beretta 418 until he received a letter from a thirty @-@ one @-@ year @-@ old Bond enthusiast and gun expert , Geoffrey Boothroyd , criticising Fleming 's choice of firearm for Bond , calling it " a lady 's gun – and not a very nice lady at that ! " Boothroyd suggested that Bond should swap his Beretta for a Walther PPK <unk> and this exchange of arms made it to Dr. No . Boothroyd also gave Fleming advice on the Berns @-@ Martin triple draw shoulder holster and a number of the weapons used by SMERSH and other villains . In thanks , Fleming gave the MI6 Armourer in his novels the name Major Boothroyd and , in Dr. No , M introduces him to Bond as " the greatest small @-@ arms expert in the world " . Bond also used a variety of rifles , including the Savage Model 99 in " For Your Eyes Only " and a Winchester .308 target rifle in " The Living Daylights " . Other handguns used by Bond in the Fleming books included the Colt Detective Special and a long @-@ barrelled Colt .45 Army Special . 
 The first Bond film , Dr. No , saw M ordering Bond to leave his Beretta behind and take up the Walther PPK , which the film Bond used in eighteen films . In Tomorrow Never Dies and the two subsequent films , Bond 's main weapon was the Walther P99 semi @-@ automatic pistol . 
 = = = Vehicles = = = 
 In the early Bond stories Fleming gave Bond a battleship @-@ grey Bentley 4 ½ Litre with an Amherst Villiers supercharger . After Bond 's car was written off by Hugo Drax in Moonraker , Fleming gave Bond a Mark II Continental Bentley , which he used in the remaining books of the series . During Goldfinger , Bond was issued with an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device , which he used to track Goldfinger across France . Bond returned to his Bentley for the subsequent novels . 
 The Bond of the films has driven a number of cars , including the Aston Martin V8 Vantage , during the 1980s , the V12 Vanquish and DBS during the 2000s , as well as the Lotus Esprit ; the BMW Z3 , BMW 750iL and the BMW Z8 . He has , however , also needed to drive a number of other vehicles , ranging from a Citroën 2CV to a Routemaster Bus , amongst others . 
 Bond 's most famous car is the silver grey Aston Martin DB5 , first seen in Goldfinger ; it later featured in Thunderball , GoldenEye , Tomorrow Never Dies , Casino Royale and Skyfall . The films have used a number of different Aston Martins for filming and publicity , one of which was sold in January 2006 at an auction in the US for $ 2 @,@ 090 @,@ 000 to an unnamed European collector . 
 = = = Gadgets = = = 
 Fleming 's novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as the booby @-@ trapped attaché case in From Russia with Love , although this situation changed dramatically with the films . However , the effects of the two Eon @-@ produced Bond films Dr. No and From Russia with Love had an effect on the novel The Man with the Golden Gun , through the increased number of devices used in Fleming 's final story . 
 For the film adaptations of Bond , the pre @-@ mission briefing by Q Branch became one of the motifs that ran through the series . Dr. No provided no spy @-@ related gadgets , but a Geiger counter was used ; industrial designer Andy Davey observed that the first ever onscreen spy @-@ gadget was the attaché case shown in From Russia with Love , which he described as " a classic 007 product " . The gadgets assumed a higher profile in the 1964 film Goldfinger . The film 's success encouraged further espionage equipment from Q Branch to be supplied to Bond , although the increased use of technology led to an accusation that Bond was over @-@ reliant on equipment , particularly in the later films . 
 Davey noted that " Bond 's gizmos follow the zeitgeist more closely than any other ... nuance in the films " as they moved from the potential representations of the future in the early films , through to the brand @-@ name obsessions of the later films . It is also noticeable that , although Bond uses a number of pieces of equipment from Q Branch , including the Little Nellie autogyro , a jet pack and the exploding attaché case , the villains are also well @-@ equipped with custom @-@ made devices , including Scaramanga 's golden gun , Rosa Klebb 's poison @-@ tipped shoes , Oddjob 's steel @-@ rimmed bowler hat and Blofeld 's communication devices in his agents ' vanity case . 
 = = Cultural impact = = 
 <unk> , Bond has been a major influence within the spy genre since the release of Dr. No in 1962 , with 22 secret agent films released in 1966 alone attempting to capitalise on the Bond franchise 's popularity and success . The first parody was the 1964 film Carry On Spying , which shows the villain Dr. Crow being overcome by agents who included James Bind ( Charles <unk> ) and Daphne <unk> ( Barbara Windsor ) . One of the films that reacted against the portrayal of Bond was the Harry Palmer series , whose first film , The Ipcress File was released in 1965 . The eponymous hero of the series was what academic Jeremy Packer called an " anti @-@ Bond " , or what Christoph Lindner calls " the thinking man 's Bond " . The Palmer series were produced by Harry Saltzman , who also used key crew members from the Bond series , including designer Ken Adam , editor Peter R. Hunt and composer John Barry . The four " Matt Helm " films starring Dean Martin ( released between 1966 and 1969 ) , the " Flint " series starring James Coburn ( comprising two films , one each in 1966 and 1969 ) , while The Man from U.N.C.L.E. also moved onto the cinema screen , with eight films released : all were testaments to Bond 's prominence in popular culture . More recently , the Austin Powers series by writer , producer and comedian Mike Myers , and other parodies such as the 2003 film Johnny English , have also used elements from or parodied the Bond films . 
 Following the release of the film Dr. No in 1962 , the line " Bond ... James Bond " , became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of Western popular culture : writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in Dr. No that the " signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever " . In 2001 , it was voted as the " best @-@ loved one @-@ liner in cinema " by British cinema goers , and in 2005 , it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the American Film Institute as part of their 100 Years Series . The 2005 American Film Institute 's ' 100 Years ' series recognised the character of James Bond himself as the third greatest film hero . He was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by Empire and as the fifth greatest movie character of all time by Premiere . 
 The 23 James Bond films produced by Eon Productions , which have grossed $ 4 @,@ 910 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in box office returns alone , have made the series one of the highest @-@ grossing ever . It is estimated that since Dr. No , a quarter of the world 's population have seen at least one Bond film . The UK Film Distributors ' Association have stated that the importance of the Bond series of films to the British film industry cannot be overstated , as they " form the backbone of the industry " . 
 Television also saw the effect of Bond films , with the NBC series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. , which was described as the " first network television imitation " of Bond , largely because Fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series , even giving the main character the name Napoleon Solo . Other 1960s television series inspired by Bond include I Spy , and Get Smart . 
 By 2012 , James Bond had become such a symbol of the United Kingdom that the character , played by Craig , appeared in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics as Queen Elizabeth II 's escort . 
 Throughout the life of the film series , a number of tie @-@ in products have been released . 
 = = Criticisms of James Bond = = 
 The James Bond character and related media have triggered a number of criticisms and reactions across the political spectrum , and are still highly debated in popular culture studies . Left @-@ leaning observers often accuse Bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism . Bond is also seen as a white male fantasy of the conspicuous consumption of luxury goods ( cars , clothes , houses , etc . ) and objectification of women . Geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in the dynamics of the Cold War , with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas . Other critics claim that 21st century Bond movies reflect imperial nostalgia . American conservative critics , particularly in the 1960s and 1970s , saw Bond as a nihilistic , hedonistic , and amoral character that challenged family values .

 Silent Hill 3 is set in the fictional universe of the Silent Hill series . Seventeen years before the start of Silent Hill 3 , in the year 1983 , Harry Mason defeated a god brought forth by the resident cult of Silent Hill and at the ending , was given a baby girl to care for .

As Heather attempts to unravel the reasons why the cult of Silent Hill is pursuing her , she encounters a private investigator named Douglas Cartland ; Vincent , a member of the cult who detests Claudia ; and Leonard Wolf , Claudia 's abusive father . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 At the beginning of the game , Heather awakens at a shopping mall , having fallen asleep while dining at a burger joint ; she had been dreaming of being trapped in a demented amusement park , forced to follow roller coaster tracks in her flight from monstrous creatures and subsequently being run down by the roller coaster . Before she can leave the mall , a private detective called Douglas Cartland confronts her , claiming to have information about her birth . Heather evades him and discovers that the mall is mostly abandoned except for monsters . She encounters Claudia , who hints about Heather 's fate . Heather finds herself in the Otherworld version of the mall — monster @-@ filled and decaying — and is eventually restored back to the original shopping mall where she encounters Douglas , who confesses that Claudia had hired him to find her . Heather leaves the mall and resolves to take the subway home . Having arrived at her residence , Heather discovers that her father has been killed by a monster under the orders of Claudia , who tells her that she will be waiting for her in Silent Hill and leaves . 
 Heather resolves to go to Silent Hill , intent on killing Claudia . She meets with Douglas in her apartment and accepts his offer to drive her there . On the journey there , Douglas explains that Vincent left him a message , telling them to look for a man named Leonard , while Heather reads a memo left by her father before his death , which reveals that she is the baby girl that was left to her adoptive father , Harry Mason , at the conclusion of the first game , after he defeated the god birthed by Alessa Gillespie . Claudia seeks Heather to birth the cult 's god , since Heather is Alessa 's reincarnation . 
 Upon arriving in Silent Hill , which is abandoned and fog @-@ shrouded , Heather checks Brookhaven Hospital for Leonard . After discovering that Leonard is Claudia 's father , Heather meets a transfigured Leonard , who attacks her after discovering that she is not a cult member ; Heather defeats him . She eventually meets Vincent , who directs her to a church via a local amusement park , purportedly at Douglas ' request . Heather arrives at the amusement park , where she finds Douglas wounded . She reaches the church and confronts Claudia , who kills Vincent . After swallowing a substance within a pendant that her father had given her , Heather vomits out the deity in fetus form . Claudia swallows the fetus and dies after birthing the deity ; Heather then fights and defeats the god . 
 Three endings appear in the game . The " Normal " ending , which is the only ending available on the first play @-@ through of the game , sees Heather and Douglas survive .

 = = Development = = 
 Silent Hill 3 was created by Team Silent , a production group within Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo . Development on the PlayStation 2 version began after the release of Silent Hill 2 in September 2001 , and was carried out almost simultaneously with development of another Silent Hill title that was intended to explore a different direction for the franchise and not be part of the main , numbered series ; known as Room 302 , this game would eventually become integrated into the main series as Silent Hill 4 : The Room . The development team for this iteration was smaller than that working on Silent Hill 2 , with around 40 people working on the game , made up of the core team from the second title and some newcomers . A smaller group of Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo staff later developed a port for Microsoft Windows . 
 Like all Silent Hill games , one of Silent Hill 3 's influences is the film Jacob 's Ladder : one of the subway platforms is named Bergen Street Station , the station Jacob was inquiring about at the beginning of the film . The developers also cited horror writer Stephen King as another of their influences . Silent Hill 3 incorporates references drawn from real life actors and actresses . Douglas Cartland 's name came from American actor Douglas Fairbanks . The developers stated that his name " just seemed to suit him " and that there was no true connection to his namesake . During the sketching process , his character was modeled after actors Giancarlo Giannini and Ian Holm . It was noted that even during the concept designs that Cartland was designed as a middle @-@ aged detective . Claudia Wolf 's character was considered the most difficult to design . Early sketches revealed that the creators wanted to dress her like a holy woman , and at one point she had a shaved head , with her body covered with tattoos , however , the creators thought that this way of showing her malevolent side was too obvious . Eventually , the creators decided to model her on Julianne Moore , and then remove her eyebrows , so that the appearance was slightly skewed . She was first named " Christie " , but it was deemed too " cute " and the character was eventually named after actress Claudia Cardinale . Vincent 's name originated from actor Vincent Gallo in connection with his unshaven look . Early designs were based on actor Ethan Hawke and focused on capturing a look of " derangement and moodiness . "
