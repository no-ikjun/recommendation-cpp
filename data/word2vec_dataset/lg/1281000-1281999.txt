 = 1933 Florida – Mexico hurricane = 
 The 1933 Florida – Mexico hurricane was the first of two Atlantic hurricanes to strike the Treasure Coast region of Florida in the very active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season . It was one of two storms that year to inflict hurricane @-@ force winds over South Texas , causing significant damage there ; the other occurred in early September . The fifth tropical cyclone of the year , it formed east of the Lesser Antilles on July 24 , rapidly strengthening as it moved west @-@ northwest . As it passed over the islands , it attained hurricane status on July 26 , producing heavy rains and killing at least six people . Over the next three days , it moved north of the Caribbean , paralleling the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Bahamas . The storm produced extensive damage and at least one drowning as it crossed the Bahamas . On July 29 , the cyclone came under the influence of changing steering currents in the atmosphere , which forced the storm into Florida near Hobe Sound a day later . A minimal hurricane at landfall , it caused negligible wind damage as it crossed Florida , but generated heavy rains along its path , causing locally severe flooding . The storm turned west , weakened to below hurricane status , and later exited the state north of Charlotte Harbor on July 31 . 
 Once over the eastern Gulf of Mexico , the storm shifted its course to the west @-@ southwest and gradually recovered its intensity . The path of the storm brought it close to the mouth of the Rio Grande in early August . Few ships encountered the small storm as it regained hurricane status on August 4 , just a day before striking northern Mexico with winds of 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) — making it close to a modern @-@ day Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane wind scale . Striking close to the border between the United States and Mexico , the storm caused extensive damage in both countries . Winds damaged buildings and crops in Tamaulipas and the southern regions of Texas , with heavy losses to citrus production in the Rio Grande Valley . While only one person died in the United States , heavy rains led to catastrophic flooding that claimed at least 31 lives in northern Mexico ; the worst @-@ hit areas were in and near the city of Monterrey . While monetary losses in Mexico were unclear , the storm did at least $ 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in damages in the United States , measured in contemporary U.S. dollars . 
 = = Historical context = = 
 The July storm was not the last to damage the Treasure Coast of Florida in 1933 : a much stronger cyclone in September , with winds of 125 mph ( 200 km / h ) , extensively damaged the same area that the July storm affected . This storm overshadowed memories of the earlier hurricane , and would be remembered as among the worst on the Treasure Coast as late as the 1980s . The occurrence of two hurricanes on the east coast of Florida in the same season is a relatively rare event in historical records , but not unprecedented : for instance , forensic research by weather historian David M. Ludlum suggests that two or more hurricanes in 1837 may have affected the region . Citing reports from William Reid in Law of Storms ( 1838 ) , Ludlum noted that two hurricanes affected Central and Northeast Florida on August 1 – 2 and September 6 , respectively , while other storms , potentially hurricanes , may have done so later in September . The September hurricane struck between St. Augustine and Jacksonville . Incidentally , the 1837 Atlantic hurricane season was apparently very active , like 1933 ; as in 2004 , a record four hurricanes hit the state of Florida , including the infamous Racer 's Storm in October .

 At 12 : 00 UTC on July 24 , HURDAT initialized a tropical depression some 430 miles ( 690 km ) east of Saint Lucia in the Windward Islands . ( This was at the time that another tropical system formed over 450 mi ( 725 km ) east of Bermuda . ) Prior to reanalysis in 2012 , official records indicated formation at 12 : 00 UTC on July 25 ; however , examination of observations from ships and land stations revealed a closed low a day earlier . Upon generation , the depression moved generally west @-@ northwest , toward the eastern Caribbean , becoming a tropical storm at 00 : 00 UTC on July 25 . However , ships and weather stations did not observe gales until later that day , so the winds in HURDAT were interpolated , but based on available data , the storm strengthened steadily . At 16 : 00 UTC , the British steamship <unk> recorded a pressure of 1 @,@ 012 mb ( 29 @.@ 87 inHg ) , followed by peak winds of Force 9 , about 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) , from the east . Around that time , the island of Antigua also experienced gales and a pressure of 1 @,@ 002 mb ( 29 @.@ 59 inHg ) as the storm made landfall with winds of 60 to 70 mph ( 95 to 110 km / h ) . A barometer on Saba measured 983 mb ( 29 @.@ 02 inHg ) , implying maximum sustained winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) ; based on this , the storm was posthumously upgraded to hurricane status at 00 : 00 UTC on July 26 , 12 hours earlier than once designated in HURDAT . 
 As the storm neared Saint Thomas , the island experienced northeast winds of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) . On its west @-@ northwest course , the storm — now equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane — missed Puerto Rico to its northeast . On July 27 , the cyclone brushed Grand Turk and the Caicos , producing winds visually estimated at 85 mph ( 137 km / h ) on the former island , with a peripheral pressure of 995 mb ( 29 @.@ 37 inHg ) . The hurricane gradually bent to the northwest as it followed the arc of the eastern Bahamas . After 15 : 00 UTC on July 28 , the Norwegian steamship <unk> encountered southeast winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) , yet pressures only dipped to 1 @,@ 002 mb ( 29 @.@ 58 inHg ) . The storm struck Cat Island , Bahamas , around 18 : 00 UTC with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) ; the next day , the storm made another landfall on the Abaco Islands with the same winds . During this time , the storm turned to the west @-@ northwest , nearing the east coast of Florida ; this was likely due to a robust subtropical ridge in the area . 
 Based on ship reports , the storm made its only landfall in the United States on Jupiter Island , between Port Salerno and Hobe Sound , Florida , around 16 : 00 UTC on July 30 . Some hours earlier , the American steamship El Almirante encountered hurricane @-@ force winds — the only such instance at sea in the storm — concurrent with a pressure of 998 mb ( 29 @.@ 46 inHg ) . Another ship nearby made a reading of 992 mb ( 29 @.@ 29 inHg ) coincident with winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , hinting that it was taken inside the eye of the storm ; calculations by researchers determined that the central pressure was 988 mb ( 29 @.@ 18 inHg ) at the time and at landfall in Florida . While this supported winds of only tropical storm force ( 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) ) , the storm had a small radius of outermost closed isobar embedded in a ridge of high pressure , so winds in Florida were deemed to be 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) , affirming earlier reports that listed the storm as a hurricane at landfall . After landfall , the storm weakened to a tropical storm and moved slowly westward across the south @-@ central peninsula , passing over the northern end of Lake Okeechobee early on July 31 . The center of the compact tropical cyclone then passed slightly north of Punta Gorda and reached the Gulf of Mexico , between Venice and Englewood , with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . 
 From this point , few ships were near the center of the storm with which to accurately discern its location and intensity , though data on August 1 – 2 confirmed a weaker cyclone than earlier . At 00 : 00 UTC on August 1 , the storm began a persistent west @-@ southwest motion that continued for the rest of its life cycle . A few ships on August 1 – 3 noted modest gales of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) , with the lowest pressure on weather maps being 1 @,@ 004 mb ( 29 @.@ 65 inHg ) at 12 : 00 UTC on August 3 . Based on this pressure , reanalysis inferred that the storm began gradually restrengthening a day earlier , reaching 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) at the time of the reading . Although the storm regained hurricane status at 00 : 00 UTC on August 4 , due to the sparsity of ship data , weather forecasters at the time assumed the storm only contained gale @-@ force winds . For a day , the storm briefly angled to the west as it neared the Mexico – United States border , reaching its final and strongest peak of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) late on August 4 . <unk> in Brownsville , Texas , verified a landfall near Playa Lauro Villar , Tamaulipas , just south of the Rio Grande , near 01 : 00 UTC on August 5 . Based on the data , scientists ascertained a radius of maximum wind of about 30 mi ( 45 km ) as the eye made landfall . <unk> in Brownsville showed pressures of 981 to 982 mb ( 28 @.@ 98 to 29 inHg ) , attesting a central pressure of 975 mb ( 28 @.@ 79 inHg ) in the eye . Now hooking west @-@ southwest , the storm quickly atrophied as it moved inland and vanished over easternmost Nuevo León by 18 : 00 UTC on August 5 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Although the storm affected several Caribbean islands , the Turks and Caicos , and the Bahamas , preparations there , if any , were unclear . Residents across Puerto Rico boarded up windows and secured roofs in anticipation of damaging winds . Governor Robert Hayes Gore placed the Hurricane Relief Organization and Red Cross on standby . As the storm neared Florida , the United States Weather Bureau — later the National Weather Service — posted storm warnings between Miami and Titusville . These were later extended to include the west coast of the state from Punta Rassa to Tarpon Springs . At the time , forecasters were unaware that the storm was of hurricane status ; this unawareness extended to the storm 's passage over the Gulf of Mexico . Forecasters only issued storm warnings for part of the Texas coast , including the cities of Brownsville and Freeport . 
 Upon news of the storm , businesses in West Palm Beach boarded up vulnerable , expensive plate glass windows . Fearing flooding , authorities were empowered by Florida governor David <unk> to evacuate over 4 @,@ 200 – 5 @,@ 000 residents , most of whom were black farm workers , from low @-@ lying areas around Lake Okeechobee to elevated locations . Most of the evacuees left by train , prompted by fears of washouts on the track beds . A day before the storm , the lake level reached 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) , heightening officials ' concerns about flooding and spurring the evacuations . Several railway companies lent free transport to their passengers , and trains were conveniently stationed around the lake . The evacuations took place in the communities of Belle Glade , Pahokee , Canal Point , Okeechobee , and Clewiston . Relief organizations and local mayors distributed milk , biscuits , and coffee to evacuees . On the west coast of the state , some residents covered their windows , but many others did not , anticipating little damage from the weak storm . Citizens received radio updates from the Weather Bureau , which gave the position and movement of the storm . Some beachfront residents , such as in Sarasota , left their homes for safety , while boaters secured their vessels . 
 In Texas , the Weather Bureau notified people early enough to allow mass evacuations : most coastal residents and camping visitors evacuated the vulnerable islands as the storm neared . Between 60 – 70 % of Port Isabel 's 500 residents left before the storm , with the remainder sheltering in a sturdy brick store on the highest land available . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Throughout the hurricane 's path from the Caribbean , to Florida , and finally into Texas and Mexico , 39 people were killed . Thirty @-@ one deaths occurred in Mexico , six in Saint Kitts , and one in both the Bahamas and Texas . Although figures from Mexico were unavailable , total losses from the storm in the United States reached about $ 3 million , inclusive of Florida and Texas , though figures for the latter state varied from $ 500 @,@ 000 to $ 1 @.@ 75 million , according to various sources . 
 = = = Caribbean = = = 
 As it passed over the Lesser Antilles , the storm caused at least six deaths on the island of Saint Kitts — then known as Saint Christopher Island — and the Virgin Islands reported torrential rains , though no damage was reported . The barometer dipped to 1 @,@ 005 mb ( 29 @.@ 69 inHg ) as the storm bypassed the islands to the south . Crops and farm fencing on Saint Croix sustained some damage , though overall effects were limited . Coincidentally , the storm arrived the day after Hurricane Supplication Day , a local tradition marking the opening of hurricane season on the fourth Monday in July . In the Bahamas , winds of 84 mph ( 135 km / h ) swept the Abaco Islands early on July 29 , but caused only minimal damage there . Other reports indicated more severe damage elsewhere in the islands , including across the Turks and Caicos Islands , and one death from drowning . The American schooner Adams , anchored off Grand Turk , was dragged out to sea by the hurricane 's waves . 
 = = = Florida = = = 
 Wind damage was generally minimal as the small hurricane crossed Florida , except to citrus crops and snapped vegetation in some areas . According to a survey by local fire officials , the calm eye was observed from Hobe Sound to the edge of Stuart , during which passage " hardly a needle in pine trees along the side of the road could be seen moving . " Peak winds estimated or registered at 60 to 70 mph ( 97 to 113 km / h ) affected the coast between Stuart and Fort Pierce . The winds downed several telegraph poles and destroyed a structure at Stuart , but otherwise little damage resulted . Initial reports from Fort Pierce signaled no uprooted trees . Farther south , apart from a snapped coconut palm , the town of Palm Beach evinced little damage to foliage . In Fort Pierce , heavier losses to grapefruit were accounted at about 25 % , especially in exposed groves , and some trees suffered total loss of fruit . Shrubs and roofs in the city were damaged as well , but power and water services were quickly revived as the worst of the storm passed . Final losses to citrus in the Indian River region were tallied at 10 – 20 % , with much greater tolls locally . Avocado and mango trees also sustained significant damage . A minimum pressure of 1 @,@ 004 mb ( 29 @.@ 66 inHg ) occurred in Stuart , the same as in Jupiter — both unusually high for a hurricane , though likely related to the storm 's small size . In fact , contemporary meteorologists concluded that the storm had only hit Florida at tropical storm strength , with top winds of 70 mph ( 113 km / h ) in Stuart . 
 Despite the relatively modest winds , prolific rains attended the cyclone . A rain gauge at the Palm Beach Post office in West Palm Beach counted 12 @.@ 01 inches ( 305 mm ) on July 30 – 31 , setting a 24 @-@ hour record at that location — 3 @.@ 19 in ( 81 mm ) above the daily maximum for the week of the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane . This established a monthly record as well , the total being 23 @.@ 28 in ( 591 mm ) for July . Ultimately , totals exceeding 15 @.@ 25 in ( 387 mm ) fell over a two @-@ day span , with a storm total of 15 @.@ 7 in ( 399 mm ) . Other rain gauges , such as one that blew over in Fort Pierce , failed to measure the true totals , which were likely underestimated . The deluge turned lawns into " small lakes , " overflowed curbs on Royal Palm Way for two blocks , and left up to 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) of water in the streets of Royal Park , a neighborhood in Palm Beach . Floodwaters submerged all but the highest land on a nearby golf course , which was navigable only by boat . The copious rains submerged roads and rural countryside in Palm Beach , Martin , and St. Lucie counties , but did not render highways impassible for traffic . However , roads in the Jupiter area could only be traversed " with great difficulty , " and water stood 2 @.@ 5 ft ( 0 @.@ 76 m ) deep on parts of Dixie Highway . Floodwaters shut down a bridge in town , and aside from a West Palm Beach commuter , bus drivers were the only motorists on flooded roads . The Post described the predicament of Matt Platt , the commuter from West Palm Beach , as he entered Jupiter : 
 Trains were getting through but travel by car in any direction was almost taboo . [ ... ] Water ... at times was up to the lights on his car , [ and he ] was the only person to drive into the town Monday [ July 31 ] ... 
 – Palm Beach Post , August 1 , 1933 
 Reports from Jupiter detailed a town almost " cut off " by floodwaters . A washout affected a 70 @-@ foot ( 21 m ) section of track bed on the Florida East Coast Railway in Port Salerno , halting three passenger trains for a combined 7 @.@ 5 hours . Nearby , floodwaters stranded two Florida Motor Lines buses as water rose to cover the floors . Relief vehicles later transported passengers on their way . African @-@ American communities in Stuart reported severe flooding as well , and torrential rains formed potholes in streets in West Palm Beach . The rains demonstrated that local communities could be stranded , causing funds to be expedited toward bridge repairs on the Loxahatchee River near Jupiter . As late as August 2 , floodwaters remained 1 @.@ 5 to 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 46 to 0 @.@ 61 m ) deep along Military Trail near West Palm Beach . Flooding in some areas was the worst since a hurricane in October 1924 . Winds disrupted communications with small settlements , and Stuart was unreachable for many hours . Loose branches falling on power lines temporarily disrupted electricity in Palm Beach , where flooding affected low @-@ lying ground . The effects were similar to those attending earlier storms . Sewers in West Palm Beach backed up , causing water to seep over Dixie Highway at several spots . The water also submerged an FEC railroad siding and was 1 @.@ 5 ft ( 0 @.@ 46 m ) deep at the east end of the Royal Park bridge . Several cars were stranded while attempting to navigate flooded streets . Despite inconveniences , residents made good humor of the elements : newspapers noted that a parrot lost shortly before the storm was spotted in a tree , uninjured , and returned to its owner . 
 Inland , the storm caused no appreciable effects as it mostly crossed sparsely settled areas . Winds at Okeechobee reached 40 to 50 mph ( 64 to 80 km / h ) as the center moved south of that town early on July 31 . Heavy rains extended over the area , with 24 @-@ hour amounts of 12 @.@ 02 in ( 305 mm ) in Indiantown and 15 @.@ 6 in ( 396 mm ) at a water transport lock . Additional heavy rains fell over the west coast of Florida , but to a lesser extent than on the east ; as was the case elsewhere , notable wind damage was almost non @-@ existent . Little immediate damage from wind and rain resulted in the Everglades and near Lake Okeechobee . Winds peaked at 30 mph ( 48 km / h ) in Pahokee , along the lake 's eastern shore , and the lake level rose 18 in ( 457 mm ) on July 30 – 31 , which was not enough to induce flooding , although the Kissimmee River , which fed into Lake Okeechobee , rose steadily , owing to heavy rains . The Weather Bureau office in Tampa recorded peak winds of 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) . In St. Petersburg , citizens enjoyed a refreshing northeast breeze that removed dead fronds from palms , uprooted scattered plants , and sent waves splashing over seawalls . An anemometer operated by United States Airways at Grand Central Airport , a now @-@ defunct airport on Weedon Island , clocked 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) winds . 
 = = = Texas and Mexico = = = 
 As the hurricane affected Brownsville , strong winds — estimated at 80 to 90 mph ( 130 to 140 km / h ) — rent apart tree limbs , tore off roofs , and cracked plate glass windows . Debris covered streets in nearby Port Isabel , where waterfront fishing huts were wrecked . High seas also destroyed many structures on South Padre Island and partly submerged Padre and Brazos islands . High tides eroded 500 ft ( 150 m ) of highway on Brazos . Almost no building in Port Isabel went unscathed , with poorly built structures flattened ; among the worst hit were at a development company . Early reports confirmed that airborne glass from the local courthouse mildly injured a man in Brownsville . The storm also disrupted communications between the Texas mainland and the barrier islands , where high tides stranded 25 – 30 campers and a detachment of cavalry from Fort Brown . Two hangars in Brownsville collapsed from the winds as well . A smokestack at a canning facility in La Feria collapsed under the strain of high winds . Water levels along the Rio Grande rose by 14 ft ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) , though the river ultimately fell short of flood stage and spared surrounding areas of damage . The storm ruined between 8 – 10 % of the citrus crop in the Rio Grande Valley , and caused at least one death in Texas . Localized losses to the citrus crop reached 25 % and upwards of 50 % of the cotton crop was blown away in the lower valley region . Total crop damage reached $ 2 million . 
 In Mexico , the storm produced torrential rains that resulted in severe flooding , particularly in riparian areas along and near the Santa Catarina River in Monterrey , where at least 31 people died as floods made more than a quarter of the city inaccessible . The collapse of a bridge isolated the Colonia Independencia . Raging waters destroyed 300 homes in one section alone , forcing occupants to flee , and the number of homeless reached the " thousands . " Governor Lázaro Cárdenas and Mayor Calles called upon all city and state facilities for relief efforts . Many people required evacuation by boat in what were described as " thrilling rescues . " The effects of the storm prostrated electrical and communications lines as well as trees in the city . Nearer to the coast , strong winds severely damaged the famed Teatro Reforma , a theater dating to the Maximilian era of the 1860s , in Matamoros , Tamaulipas , where many homes were destroyed . 
 = Alexander the Great = 
 Alexander III of Macedon ( 20 / 21 July 356 BC – 10 / 11 June 323 BC ) , commonly known as Alexander the Great ( Greek : <unk> ὁ Μέγας , <unk> ho <unk> [ <unk> ho <unk> ] ) , was a King ( Basileus ) of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member of the <unk> dynasty . Born in Pella in 356 BC , Alexander succeeded his father , Philip II , to the throne at the age of twenty . He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa , and by the age of thirty he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world , stretching from Greece to northwestern India . He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history 's most successful military commanders . 
 During his youth , Alexander was tutored by the philosopher Aristotle until the age of 16 . After Philip 's assassination in 336 BC , Alexander succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army . Alexander was awarded the generalship of Greece and used this authority to launch his father 's Panhellenic project to lead the Greeks in the conquest of Persia . In 334 BC , he invaded the Achaemenid Empire , ruled Asia Minor , and began a series of campaigns that lasted ten years . Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles , most notably the battles of Issus and Gaugamela . He subsequently overthrew the Persian King Darius III and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety . At that point , his empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River . 
 Seeking to reach the " ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea " , he invaded India in 326 BC , but was eventually forced to turn back at the demand of his troops . Alexander died in Babylon in 323 BC , the city he planned to establish as his capital , without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia . In the years following his death , a series of civil wars tore his empire apart , resulting in several states ruled by the Diadochi , Alexander 's surviving generals and heirs . 
 Alexander 's legacy includes the cultural diffusion his conquests engendered , such as Greco @-@ Buddhism . He founded some twenty cities that bore his name , most notably Alexandria in Egypt . Alexander 's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture in the east resulted in a new Hellenistic civilization , aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid @-@ 15th century and the presence of Greek speakers in central and far eastern Anatolia until the 1920s . Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mold of Achilles , and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non @-@ Greek cultures . He became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves , and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics . He is often ranked among the most influential people in human history , along with his teacher Aristotle .

 Alexander was born on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of <unk> , which probably corresponds to 20 July 356 BC , although the exact date is not known , in Pella , the capital of the Kingdom of Macedon . He was the son of the king of Macedon , Philip II , and his fourth wife , Olympias , the daughter of Neoptolemus I , king of Epirus . Although Philip had seven or eight wives , Olympias was his principal wife for some time , likely a result of giving birth to Alexander . 
 Several legends surround Alexander 's birth and childhood . According to the ancient Greek biographer Plutarch , Olympias , on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip , dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunder bolt , causing a flame that spread " far and wide " before dying away . Some time after the wedding , Philip is said to have seen himself , in a dream , securing his wife 's womb with a seal engraved with a lion 's image . Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams : that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage , indicated by the sealing of her womb ; or that Alexander 's father was Zeus . Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander 's divine parentage , variously claiming that she had told Alexander , or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious . 
 On the day Alexander was born , Philip was preparing a siege on the city of Potidea on the peninsula of Chalcidice . That same day , Philip received news that his general Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian and <unk> armies , and that his horses had won at the Olympic Games . It was also said that on this day , the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus , one of the Seven Wonders of the World , burnt down . This led <unk> of Magnesia to say that it had burnt down because Artemis was away , attending the birth of Alexander . Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king , and possibly at his own instigation , to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception . 
 In his early years , Alexander was raised by a nurse , <unk> , sister of Alexander 's future general Cleitus the Black . Later in his childhood , Alexander was tutored by the strict Leonidas , a relative of his mother , and by Lysimachus of Acarnania . Alexander was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths , learning to read , play the lyre , ride , fight , and hunt . 
 When Alexander was ten years old , a trader from Thessaly brought Philip a horse , which he offered to sell for thirteen talents . The horse refused to be mounted and Philip ordered it away . Alexander however , detecting the horse 's fear of its own shadow , asked to tame the horse , which he eventually managed . Plutarch stated that Philip , overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition , kissed his son tearfully , declaring : " My boy , you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions . Macedon is too small for you " , and bought the horse for him . Alexander named it <unk> , meaning " ox @-@ head " . <unk> carried Alexander as far as India . When the animal died ( due to old age , according to Plutarch , at age thirty ) , Alexander named a city after him , Bucephala . 
 = = = Adolescence and education = = = 
 When Alexander was 13 , Philip began to search for a tutor , and considered such academics as Isocrates and <unk> , the latter offering to resign to take up the post . In the end , Philip chose Aristotle and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at <unk> as a classroom . In return for teaching Alexander , Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle 's hometown of <unk> , which Philip had razed , and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex @-@ citizens who were slaves , or pardoning those who were in exile . 
 <unk> was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles , such as Ptolemy , <unk> , and Cassander . Many of these students would become his friends and future generals , and are often known as the ' Companions ' . Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine , philosophy , morals , religion , logic , and art . Under Aristotle 's tutelage , Alexander developed a passion for the works of Homer , and in particular the Iliad ; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy , which Alexander later carried on his campaigns . 
 = = Philip 's heir = = 
 = = = Regency and ascent of Macedon = = = 
 At age 16 , Alexander 's education under Aristotle ended . Philip waged war against Byzantion , leaving Alexander in charge as regent and heir apparent . During Philip 's absence , the Thracian <unk> revolted against Macedonia . Alexander responded quickly , driving them from their territory . He colonized it with Greeks , and founded a city named <unk> . 
 Upon Philip 's return , he dispatched Alexander with a small force to subdue revolts in southern Thrace . Campaigning against the Greek city of Perinthus , Alexander is reported to have saved his father 's life . Meanwhile , the city of Amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to Apollo near Delphi , a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs . Still occupied in Thrace , he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in Greece . Concerned that other Greek states might intervene , Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead . During this turmoil , the Illyrians invaded Macedonia , only to be repelled by Alexander . 
 Philip and his army joined his son in 338 BC , and they marched south through Thermopylae , taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison . They went on to occupy the city of Elatea , only a few days ' march from both Athens and Thebes . The Athenians , led by Demosthenes , voted to seek alliance with Thebes against Macedonia . Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win Thebes ' favor , but Athens won the contest . Philip marched on Amphissa ( ostensibly acting on the request of the Amphictyonic League ) , capturing the mercenaries sent there by Demosthenes and accepting the city 's surrender . Philip then returned to Elatea , sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes , who both rejected it . 
 As Philip marched south , his opponents blocked him near Chaeronea , Boeotia . During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea , Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left , accompanied by a group of Philip 's trusted generals . According to the ancient sources , the two sides fought bitterly for some time . Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat , counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow , thus breaking their line . Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines , followed by Philip 's generals . Having damaged the enemy 's cohesion , Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them . With the Athenians lost , the Thebans were surrounded . Left to fight alone , they were defeated . 
 After the victory at Chaeronea , Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese , welcomed by all cities ; however , when they reached Sparta , they were refused , but did not resort to war . At Corinth , Philip established a " Hellenic Alliance " ( modeled on the old anti @-@ Persian alliance of the Greco @-@ Persian Wars ) , which included most Greek city @-@ states except Sparta . Philip was then named Hegemon ( often translated as " Supreme Commander " ) of this league ( known by modern scholars as the League of Corinth ) , and announced his plans to attack the Persian Empire . 
 = = = Exile and return = = = 
 When Philip returned to Pella , he fell in love with and married Cleopatra Eurydice , the niece of his general Attalus . The marriage made Alexander 's position as heir less secure , since any son of Cleopatra Eurydice would be a fully Macedonian heir , while Alexander was only half @-@ Macedonian . During the wedding banquet , a drunken Attalus publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir . 
 At the wedding of Cleopatra , whom Philip fell in love with and married , she being much too young for him , her uncle Attalus in his drink desired the Macedonians would implore the gods to give them a lawful successor to the kingdom by his niece . This so irritated Alexander , that throwing one of the cups at his head , " You villain , " said he , " what , am I then a bastard ? " Then Philip , taking Attalus 's part , rose up and would have run his son through ; but by good fortune for them both , either his over @-@ hasty rage , or the wine he had drunk , made his foot slip , so that he fell down on the floor . At which Alexander reproachfully insulted over him : " See there , " said he , " the man who makes preparations to pass out of Europe into Asia , overturned in passing from one seat to another . " 
 Alexander fled Macedon with his mother , dropping her off with her brother , King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona , capital of the Molossians . He continued to Illyria , where he sought refuge with the Illyrian king and was treated as a guest , despite having defeated them in battle a few years before . However , it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son . Accordingly , Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend , Demaratus , who mediated between the two parties . 
 In the following year , the Persian satrap ( governor ) of Caria , <unk> , offered his eldest daughter to Alexander 's half @-@ brother , Philip Arrhidaeus . Olympias and several of Alexander 's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir . Alexander reacted by sending an actor , Thessalus of Corinth , to tell <unk> that he should not offer his daughter 's hand to an illegitimate son , but instead to Alexander . When Philip heard of this , he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian , explaining that he wanted a better bride for him . Philip exiled four of Alexander 's friends , Harpalus , Nearchus , Ptolemy and <unk> , and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains .

 In summer 336 BC , while at <unk> attending the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra to Olympias 's brother , Alexander I of Epirus , Philip was assassinated by the captain of his bodyguards , Pausanias . As Pausanias tried to escape , he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers , including two of Alexander 's companions , Perdiccas and <unk> . Alexander was proclaimed king by the nobles and army at the age of 20 . 
 = = = Consolidation of power = = = 
 Alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne . He had his cousin , the former Amyntas IV , executed . He also had two Macedonian princes from the region of <unk> killed , but spared a third , Alexander <unk> . Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and Europa , her daughter by Philip , burned alive . When Alexander learned about this , he was furious . Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus , who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatra 's uncle . 
 Attalus was at that time corresponding with Demosthenes , regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens . Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander , and following Cleopatra 's murder , Alexander may have considered him too dangerous to leave alive . Alexander spared Arrhidaeus , who was by all accounts mentally disabled , possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias . 
 News of Philip 's death roused many states into revolt , including Thebes , Athens , Thessaly , and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon . When news of the revolts reached Alexander , he responded quickly . Though advised to use diplomacy , Alexander mustered 3 @,@ 000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thessaly . He found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa , and ordered his men to ride over Mount Ossa . When the Thessalians awoke the next day , they found Alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered , adding their cavalry to Alexander 's force . He then continued south towards the Peloponnese . 
 Alexander stopped at Thermopylae , where he was recognized as the leader of the Amphictyonic League before heading south to Corinth . Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels . The famous encounter between Alexander and Diogenes the Cynic occurred during Alexander 's stay in Corinth . When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could do for him , the philosopher disdainfully asked Alexander to stand a little to the side , as he was blocking the sunlight . This reply apparently delighted Alexander , who is reported to have said " But verily , if I were not Alexander , I would like to be Diogenes . " At Corinth , Alexander took the title of Hegemon ( " leader " ) and , like Philip , was appointed commander for the coming war against Persia . He also received news of a Thracian uprising . 
 = = = Balkan campaign = = = 
 Before crossing to Asia , Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders . In the spring of 335 BC , he advanced to suppress several revolts . Starting from Amphipolis , he traveled east into the country of the " Independent Thracians " ; and at Mount Haemus , the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights . The Macedonians marched into the country of the <unk> , and defeated their army near the <unk> river ( a tributary of the Danube ) . Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube , encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore . Crossing the river at night , he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish . 
 News then reached Alexander that Cleitus , King of Illyria , and King <unk> of the <unk> were in open revolt against his authority . Marching west into Illyria , Alexander defeated each in turn , forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops . With these victories , he secured his northern frontier . 
 While Alexander campaigned north , the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again . Alexander immediately headed south . While the other cities again hesitated , Thebes decided to fight . The Theban resistance was ineffective , and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities . The end of Thebes cowed Athens , leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace . Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign , leaving Antipater as regent .

 Alexander 's army crossed the Hellespont in 334 BC with approximately 48 @,@ 100 soldiers , 6 @,@ 100 cavalry and a fleet of 120 ships with crews numbering 38 @,@ 000 , drawn from Macedon and various Greek city @-@ states , mercenaries , and <unk> raised soldiers from Thrace , <unk> , and Illyria . ( However , Arrian , who used Ptolemy as a source , said that Alexander crossed with more than 5 @,@ 000 horse and 30 @,@ 000 foot ; Diodorus quoted the same totals , but listed 5 @,@ 100 horse and 32 @,@ 000 foot . Diodorus also referred to an advance force already present in Asia , which Polyaenus , in his Stratagems of War ( 5 @.@ 44 @.@ 4 ) , said numbered 10 @,@ 000 men . ) He showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods . This also showed Alexander 's eagerness to fight , in contrast to his father 's preference for diplomacy . 
 After an initial victory against Persian forces at the Battle of the Granicus , Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provincial capital and treasury of Sardis ; he then proceeded along the Ionian coast , granting autonomy and democracy to the cities . Miletus , held by Achaemenid forces , required a delicate siege operation , with Persian naval forces nearby . Further south , at Halicarnassus , in Caria , Alexander successfully waged his first large @-@ scale siege , eventually forcing his opponents , the mercenary captain Memnon of Rhodes and the Persian satrap of Caria , <unk> , to withdraw by sea . Alexander left the government of Caria to a member of the <unk> dynasty , Ada , who adopted Alexander . 
 From Halicarnassus , Alexander proceeded into mountainous Lycia and the <unk> plain , asserting control over all coastal cities to deny the Persians naval bases . From Pamphylia onwards the coast held no major ports and Alexander moved inland . At <unk> , Alexander humbled but did not storm the <unk> city . At the ancient Phrygian capital of <unk> , Alexander " undid " the hitherto unsolvable Gordian Knot , a feat said to await the future " king of Asia " . According to the story , Alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and hacked it apart with his sword . 
 = = = The Levant and Syria = = = 
 In spring 333 BC , Alexander crossed the Taurus into Cilicia . After a long pause due to illness , he marched on towards Syria . Though outmanoeuvered by Darius ' significantly larger army , he marched back to Cilicia , where he defeated Darius at Issus . Darius fled the battle , causing his army to collapse , and left behind his wife , his two daughters , his mother Sisygambis , and a fabulous treasure . He offered a peace treaty that included the lands he had already lost , and a ransom of 10 @,@ 000 talents for his family . Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia , it was he alone who decided territorial divisions . 
 Alexander proceeded to take possession of Syria , and most of the coast of the Levant . In the following year , 332 BC , he was forced to attack Tyre , which he captured after a long and difficult siege . Alexander massacred the men of military age and sold the women and children into slavery . 
 = = = Egypt = = = 
 When Alexander destroyed Tyre , most of the towns on the route to Egypt quickly capitulated . A later tradition recorded his entry into Jerusalem : according to Josephus , Alexander was shown the Book of Daniel 's prophecy , presumably chapter 8 , which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire . He spared Jerusalem and pushed south into Egypt . However , Alexander met with resistance at Gaza . The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill , requiring a siege . When " his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible … this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the attempt " . After three unsuccessful assaults , the stronghold fell , but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound . As in Tyre , men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery . 
 Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332 BC , where he was regarded as a liberator . He was pronounced son of the deity Amun at the Oracle of Siwa Oasis in the Libyan desert . Henceforth , Alexander often referred to Zeus @-@ Ammon as his true father , and after his death , currency depicted him adorned with rams horn as a symbol of his divinity . During his stay in Egypt , he founded Alexandria @-@ by @-@ Egypt , which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom after his death . 
 = = = Assyria and Babylonia = = = 
 Leaving Egypt in 331 BC , Alexander marched eastward into Mesopotamia ( now northern Iraq ) and again defeated Darius , at the Battle of Gaugamela . Darius once more fled the field , and Alexander chased him as far as Arbela . Gaugamela would be the final and decisive encounter between the two . Darius fled over the mountains to Ecbatana ( modern Hamedan ) , while Alexander captured Babylon . 
 = = = Persia = = = 
 From Babylon , Alexander went to Susa , one of the Achaemenid capitals , and captured its treasury . He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Persian Royal Road . Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city . He then stormed the pass of the Persian Gates ( in the modern Zagros Mountains ) which had been blocked by a Persian army under <unk> and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury . 
 On entering Persepolis , Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days . Alexander stayed in Persepolis for five months . During his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of Xerxes and spread to the rest of the city . Possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the Second Persian War by Xerxes I. Years later upon revisiting the city he had burnt , Alexander would regret the burning of Persepolis . Plutarch recounts an anecdote in which Alexander pauses and talks to a fallen statue of Xerxes the Great as if it were a live person : 
 Shall I pass by and leave you lying there because of the expeditions you led against Greece , or shall I set you up again because of your magnanimity and your virtues in other respects ? 
 = = = Fall of the Empire and the East = = = 
 Alexander then chased Darius , first into Media , and then Parthia . The Persian king no longer controlled his own destiny , and was taken prisoner by Bessus , his Bactrian satrap and kinsman . As Alexander approached , Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius ' successor as Artaxerxes V , before retreating into Central Asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against Alexander . Alexander buried Darius ' remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral . He claimed that , while dying , Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne . The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius . 
 Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him . This campaign , initially against Bessus , turned into a grand tour of central Asia . Alexander founded a series of new cities , all called Alexandria , including modern Kandahar in Afghanistan , and Alexandria <unk> ( " The Furthest " ) in modern Tajikistan . The campaign took Alexander through Media , Parthia , Aria ( West Afghanistan ) , <unk> , <unk> ( South and Central Afghanistan ) , Bactria ( North and Central Afghanistan ) , and Scythia . 
 Spitamenes , who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana , in 329 BC betrayed Bessus to Ptolemy , one of Alexander 's trusted companions , and Bessus was executed . However , when , at some point later , Alexander was on the Jaxartes dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army , Spitamenes raised Sogdiana in revolt . Alexander personally defeated the Scythians at the Battle of Jaxartes and immediately launched a campaign against Spitamenes , defeating him in the Battle of <unk> . After the defeat , Spitamenes was killed by his own men , who then sued for peace . 
 = = = Problems and plots = = = 
 During this time , Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court , notably the custom of proskynesis , either a symbolic kissing of the hand , or prostration on the ground , that Persians showed to their social superiors . The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it . This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen , and he eventually abandoned it . 
 A plot against his life was revealed , and one of his officers , <unk> , was executed for failing to alert Alexander . The death of the son necessitated the death of the father , and thus Parmenion , who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana , was assassinated at Alexander 's command , to prevent attempts at vengeance . Most infamously , Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus , Cleitus the Black , during a violent drunken altercation at <unk> ( modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan ) , in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially , of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle . 
 Later , in the Central Asian campaign , a second plot against his life was revealed , this one instigated by his own royal pages . His official historian , Callisthenes of Olynthus , was implicated in the plot ; however , historians have yet to reach a consensus regarding this involvement . Callisthenes had fallen out of favor by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis . 
 = = = Macedon in Alexander 's absence = = = 
 When Alexander set out for Asia , he left his general Antipater , an experienced military and political leader and part of Philip II 's " Old Guard " , in charge of Macedon . Alexander 's sacking of Thebes ensured that Greece remained quiet during his absence . The one exception was a call to arms by Spartan king Agis III in 331 BC , whom Antipater defeated and killed in the battle of Megalopolis . Antipater referred the Spartans ' punishment to the League of Corinth , which then deferred to Alexander , who chose to pardon them . There was also considerable friction between Antipater and Olympias , and each complained to Alexander about the other . 
 In general , Greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during Alexander 's campaign in Asia . Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest , which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire . However , Alexander 's constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon 's manpower , greatly weakening it in the years after Alexander , and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome . 
 = = Indian campaign = = 
 = = = <unk> into the Indian subcontinent = = = 
 After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana ( <unk> in Old Iranian ) to cement relations with his new satrapies , Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent . He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara , ( a region presently straddling eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan ) to come to him and submit to his authority . <unk> ( Indian name Ambhi ) , the ruler of Taxila , whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes ( Jhelum ) , complied , but the chieftains of some hill clans , including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas ( known in Indian texts also as <unk> and <unk> ) , refused to submit . Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents , placing himself and all his forces at his disposal . Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of " Persian robes , gold and silver ornaments , 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold " . Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces , and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund ( Fox 1973 ) , supplied their troops with provisions , and received Alexander himself , and his whole army , in his capital city of Taxila , with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality . 
 On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king , <unk> accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River . After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus , to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms , but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy . Subsequently , however , the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander ; and <unk> , after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes , was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus . A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip , son of <unk> ; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself ( 323 BC ) , as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at <unk> , 321 BC . 
 In the winter of 327 / 326 BC , Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans ; the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys , the <unk> of the <unk> valley , and the Assakenoi of the Swat and <unk> valleys . A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart , but eventually the Aspasioi lost . Alexander then faced the Assakenoi , who fought in the strongholds of Massaga , Ora and Aornos . 
 The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting , in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle . According to Curtius , " Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga , but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble . " A similar slaughter followed at Ora . In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora , numerous <unk> fled to the fortress of Aornos . Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill @-@ fort after four bloody days . 
 After Aornos , Alexander crossed the Indus and fought and won an epic battle against King Porus , who ruled a region lying between the Hydaspes and the <unk> ( Chenab ) , in what is now the Punjab , in the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC . Alexander was impressed by Porus ' bravery , and made him an ally . He appointed Porus as satrap , and added to Porus ' territory land that he did not previously own , towards the south @-@ east , up to the <unk> ( Beas ) . Choosing a local helped him control these lands so distant from Greece . Alexander founded two cities on opposite sides of the Hydaspes river , naming one Bucephala , in honor of his horse , who died around this time . The other was Nicaea ( Victory ) , thought to be located at the site of modern @-@ day Mong , Punjab . 
 = = = Revolt of the army = = = 
 East of Porus ' kingdom , near the Ganges River , were the Nanda Empire of Magadha and further east the <unk> Empire ( of modern @-@ day Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent ) . Fearing the prospect of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning , Alexander 's army mutinied at the <unk> River ( Beas ) , refusing to march farther east . This river thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander 's conquests . 
 As for the Macedonians , however , their struggle with Porus blunted their courage and stayed their further advance into India . For having had all they could do to repulse an enemy who mustered only twenty thousand infantry and two thousand horse , they violently opposed Alexander when he insisted on crossing the river Ganges also , the width of which , as they learned , was thirty @-@ two furlongs , its depth a hundred fathoms , while its banks on the further side were covered with multitudes of men @-@ at @-@ arms and horsemen and elephants . For they were told that the kings of the <unk> and <unk> were awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen , two hundred thousand footmen , eight thousand chariots , and six thousand war elephants . 
 Alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther , but his general <unk> pleaded with him to change his opinion and return ; the men , he said , " longed to again see their parents , their wives and children , their homeland " . Alexander eventually agreed and turned south , marching along the Indus . Along the way his army conquered the <unk> ( in modern @-@ day Multan ) and other Indian tribes and sustained an injury during the siege . 
 Alexander sent much of his army to Carmania ( modern southern Iran ) with general Craterus , and commissioned a fleet to explore the Persian Gulf shore under his admiral Nearchus , while he led the rest back to Persia through the more difficult southern route along the <unk> Desert and Makran . Alexander reached Susa in 324 BC , but not before losing many men to the harsh desert . 
 = = Last years in Persia = = 
 Discovering that many of his satraps and military governors had misbehaved in his absence , Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to Susa . As a gesture of thanks , he paid off the debts of his soldiers , and announced that he would send over @-@ aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon , led by Craterus . His troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of Opis . They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units . 
 After three days , unable to persuade his men to back down , Alexander gave Persians command posts in the army and conferred Macedonian military titles upon Persian units . The Macedonians quickly begged forgiveness , which Alexander accepted , and held a great banquet for several thousand of his men at which he and they ate together . In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects , Alexander held a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa , but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year . Meanwhile , upon his return to Persia , Alexander learned that guards of the tomb of Cyrus the Great in Pasargadae had desecrated it , and swiftly executed them . Alexander admired Cyrus , from an early age reading Xenophon 's <unk> , which described Cyrus 's heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator . During his visit to Pasargadae Alexander ordered his architect Aristobulus to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of Cyrus ' tomb . 
 Afterwards , Alexander traveled to Ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the Persian treasure . There , his closest friend and possible lover , Hephaestion , died of illness or poisoning . Hephaestion 's death devastated Alexander , and he ordered the preparation of an expensive funeral pyre in Babylon , as well as a decree for public mourning . Back in Babylon , Alexander planned a series of new campaigns , beginning with an invasion of Arabia , but he would not have a chance to realize them , as he died shortly thereafter . 
 = = Death and succession = = 
 On either 10 or 11 June 323 BC , Alexander died in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II , in Babylon , at age 32 . There are two different versions of Alexander 's death and details of the death differ slightly in each . Plutarch 's account is that roughly 14 days before his death , Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus , and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa . He developed a fever , which worsened until he was unable to speak . The common soldiers , anxious about his health , were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them . In the second account , Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles , followed by 11 days of weakness ; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony . Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative , but Plutarch specifically denied this claim . 
 Given the propensity of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination , foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death . Diodorus , Plutarch , Arrian and Justin all mentioned the theory that Alexander was poisoned . Justin stated that Alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy , Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication , while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness . The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater , recently removed as Macedonian viceroy , and at odds with Olympias , as the head of the alleged plot . Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence , and having seen the fate of Parmenion and <unk> , Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son <unk> , who was Alexander 's wine @-@ <unk> . There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated . 
 The strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death ; such long @-@ acting poisons were probably not available . However , in a 2003 BBC documentary investigating the death of Alexander , Leo <unk> from the New Zealand National Poisons Center proposed that the plant white hellebore ( Veratrum album ) , which was known in antiquity , may have been used to poison Alexander . In a 2014 manuscript in the journal Clinical Toxicology <unk> suggested Alexander 's wine was spiked with Veratrum album , and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the Alexander Romance . Veratrum album poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if Alexander was poisoned , Veratrum album offers the most plausible cause . Another poisoning explanation put forward in 2010 proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river Styx ( modern @-@ day Mavroneri in Arcadia , Greece ) that contained <unk> , a dangerous compound produced by bacteria . 
 Several natural causes ( diseases ) have been suggested , including malaria and typhoid fever . A 1998 article in the New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis . Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic ( infectious ) spondylitis or meningitis . Other illnesses fit the symptoms , including acute pancreatitis and West Nile virus . Natural @-@ cause theories also tend to emphasise that Alexander 's health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds . The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion 's death may also have contributed to his declining health . 
 = = = After death = = = 
 Alexander 's body was laid in a gold anthropoid sarcophagus that was filled with honey , which was in turn placed in a gold casket . According to Aelian , a seer called <unk> foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest " would be happy and <unk> forever " . Perhaps more likely , the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy , since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative . 
 While Alexander 's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon , Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis . His successor , Ptolemy II Philadelphus , transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria , where it remained until at least late Antiquity . Ptolemy IX <unk> , one of Ptolemy 's final successors , replaced Alexander 's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage . The recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece , at Amphipolis , dating from the time of Alexander the Great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander . This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander 's funeral cortege . 
 Pompey , Julius Caesar and Augustus all visited the tomb in Alexandria , where Augustus , allegedly , accidentally knocked the nose off . Caligula was said to have taken Alexander 's breastplate from the tomb for his own use . Around AD 200 , Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander 's tomb to the public . His son and successor , Caracalla , a great admirer , visited the tomb during his own reign . After this , details on the fate of the tomb are hazy . 
 The so @-@ called " Alexander Sarcophagus " , discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum , is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander 's remains , but because its bas @-@ reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting . It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of <unk> ( died 311 BC ) , the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the battle of Issus in 331 . However , more recently , it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than <unk> ' death . 
 = = = Division of the empire = = = 
 Alexander 's death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached Greece , they were not immediately believed . Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir , his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander 's death . According to Diodorus , Alexander 's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom ; his laconic reply was " <unk> <unk> " — " to the strongest " . 
 Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point , implying that this was an apocryphal story . Diodorus , Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas , a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry , in front of witnesses , thereby nominating him . 
 Perdiccas initially did not claim power , instead suggesting that Roxane 's baby would be king , if male ; with himself , Craterus , <unk> , and Antipater as guardians . However , the infantry , under the command of Meleager , rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion . Instead , they supported Alexander 's half @-@ brother Philip Arrhidaeus . Eventually , the two sides reconciled , and after the birth of Alexander IV , he and Philip III were appointed joint kings , albeit in name only . 
 Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians , however . The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power . After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC , Macedonian unity collapsed , and 40 years of war between " The Successors " ( Diadochi ) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocks : Ptolemaic Egypt , Seleucid Mesopotamia and Central Asia , Attalid Anatolia , and <unk> Macedon . In the process , both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered . 
 = = = Testament = = = 
 Diodorus stated that Alexander had given detailed written instructions to Craterus some time before his death . Craterus started to carry out Alexander 's commands , but the successors chose not to further implement them , on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant . Nevertheless , Perdiccas read Alexander 's will to his troops . 
 The testament called for military expansion into the southern and western Mediterranean , monumental constructions , and the intermixing of Eastern and Western populations . It included : 
 Construction of a monumental tomb for his father Philip , " to match the greatest of the pyramids of Egypt " 
 Erection of great temples in Delos , Delphi , Dodona , <unk> , Amphipolis , and a monumental temple to Athena at Troy 
 Conquest of Arabia and the entire Mediterranean Basin

 Alexander earned the epithet " the Great " due to his unparalleled success as a military commander . He never lost a battle , despite typically being outnumbered . This was due to use of terrain , phalanx and cavalry tactics , bold strategy , and the fierce loyalty of his troops . The Macedonian phalanx , armed with the <unk> , a spear 6 metres ( 20 ft ) long , had been developed and perfected by Philip II through rigorous training , and Alexander used its speed and maneuverability to great effect against larger but more disparate Persian forces . Alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse army , which employed various languages and weapons . He overcame this by being personally involved in battle , in the manner of a Macedonian king . 
 In his first battle in Asia , at Granicus , Alexander used only a small part of his forces , perhaps 13 @,@ 000 infantry with 5 @,@ 000 cavalry , against a much larger Persian force of 40 @,@ 000 . Alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings , so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line , about 3 km ( 1 @.@ 86 mi ) . By contrast , the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry . This ensured that Alexander would not be outflanked , while his phalanx , armed with long pikes , had a considerable advantage over the Persian 's scimitars and javelins . Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians . 
 At Issus in 333 BC , his first confrontation with Darius , he used the same deployment , and again the central phalanx pushed through . Alexander personally led the charge in the center , routing the opposing army . At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela , Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes . Alexander arranged a double phalanx , with the center advancing at an angle , parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming . The advance was successful and broke Darius ' center , causing the latter to flee once again . 
 When faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques , such as in Central Asia and India , Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents ' style . Thus , in Bactria and Sogdiana , Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements , while massing his cavalry at the center . In India , confronted by Porus ' elephant corps , the Macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their <unk> to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants ' handlers .

 Greek biographer Plutarch ( c . 45 – 120 AD ) describes Alexander 's appearance as : 
 ¹ The outward appearance of Alexander is best represented by the statues of him which <unk> made , and it was by this artist alone that Alexander himself thought it fit that he should be modelled . ² For those peculiarities which many of his successors and friends afterwards tried to imitate , namely , the poise of the neck , which was bent slightly to the left , and the melting glance of his eyes , this artist has accurately observed . ³ Apelles , however , in painting him as wielder of the thunder @-@ bolt , did not reproduce his complexion , but made it too dark and swarthy . Whereas he was of a fair colour , as they say , and his fairness passed into <unk> on his breast particularly , and in his face . 4 Moreover , that a very pleasant odour exhaled from his skin and that there was a fragrance about his mouth and all his flesh , so that his garments were filled with it , this we have read in the Memoirs of <unk> . 
 Greek historian Arrian ( Lucius Flavius <unk> ' Xenophon ' c . 86 – 160 ) described Alexander as : 
 [ T ] he strong , handsome commander with one eye dark as the night and one blue as the sky . 
 The semi @-@ legendary Alexander Romance also suggests that Alexander suffered from heterochromia iridum : that one eye was dark and the other light . 
 British historian Peter Green provided a description of Alexander 's appearance , based on his review of statues and some ancient documents : 
 Physically , Alexander was not prepossessing . Even by Macedonian standards he was very short , though stocky and tough . His beard was scanty , and he stood out against his hirsute Macedonian barons by going clean @-@ shaven . His neck was in some way twisted , so that he appeared to be gazing upward at an angle . His eyes ( one blue , one brown ) revealed a dewy , feminine quality . He had a high complexion and a harsh voice . 
 Ancient authors recorded that Alexander was so pleased with portraits of himself created by Lysippos that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image . Lysippos had often used the <unk> sculptural scheme to portray Alexander and other characters such as <unk> , Hermes and Eros . Lysippos ' sculpture , famous for its naturalism , as opposed to a stiffer , more static pose , is thought to be the most faithful depiction . 
 = = = Personality = = = 
 Some of Alexander 's strongest personality traits formed in response to his parents . His mother had huge ambitions , and encouraged him to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire . Olympias ' influence instilled a sense of destiny in him , and Plutarch tells us that his ambition " kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years " . However , his father Philip was Alexander 's most immediate and influential role model , as the young Alexander watched him campaign practically every year , winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds . Alexander 's relationship with his father forged the competitive side of his personality ; he had a need to out @-@ do his father , illustrated by his reckless behavior in battle . While Alexander worried that his father would leave him " no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world " , he also downplayed his father 's achievements to his companions . 
 According to Plutarch , among Alexander 's traits were a violent temper and rash , impulsive nature , which undoubtedly contributed to some of his decisions . Although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father , he was open to reasoned debate . He had a calmer side — perceptive , logical , and calculating . He had a great desire for knowledge , a love for philosophy , and was an avid reader . This was no doubt in part due to Aristotle 's tutelage ; Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn . His intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general . He had great self @-@ restraint in " pleasures of the body " , in contrast with his lack of self control with alcohol . 
 Alexander was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences . However , he had little interest in sports or the Olympic games ( unlike his father ) , seeking only the Homeric ideals of honor ( <unk> ) and glory ( kudos ) . He had great charisma and force of personality , characteristics which made him a great leader . His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death – only Alexander had the ability to do so . 
 During his final years , and especially after the death of Hephaestion , Alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia . His extraordinary achievements , coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions , may have combined to produce this effect . His delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his testament and in his desire to conquer the world , in as much , he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition , an epithet , the meaning of which , has descended into an historical cliché . 
 He appears to have believed himself a deity , or at least sought to deify himself . Olympias always insisted to him that he was the son of Zeus , a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at Siwa . He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus @-@ Ammon . Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court , notably proskynesis , a practice of which Macedonians disapproved , and were loath to perform . This behavior cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen . However , Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples , many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine . Thus , rather than megalomania , his behavior may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together . 
 = = = Personal relationships = = = 
 Alexander married three times : Roxana , daughter of the Bactrian nobleman <unk> , out of love ; and the Persian princesses <unk> II and <unk> II , the former a daughter of Darius III and latter a daughter of Artaxerxes III , for political reasons . He apparently had two sons , Alexander IV of Macedon of Roxana and , possibly , Heracles of Macedon from his mistress <unk> . He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon . 
 Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend , general , and bodyguard Hephaestion , the son of a Macedonian noble . Hephaestion 's death devastated Alexander . This event may have contributed to Alexander 's failing health and detached mental state during his final months . 
 Alexander 's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy . No ancient sources stated that Alexander had homosexual relationships , or that Alexander 's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual . Aelian , however , writes of Alexander 's visit to Troy where " Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of Patroclus , the latter riddling that he was a beloved of Alexander , in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles . " Noting that the word eromenos ( ancient Greek for beloved ) does not necessarily bear sexual meaning , Alexander may have been bisexual , which in his time was not controversial . 
 Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women ; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life . However , he was relatively young when he died , and Ogden suggests that Alexander 's matrimonial record is more impressive than his father 's at the same age . Apart from wives , Alexander had many more female companions . Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings , but he used it rather sparingly ; showing great self @-@ control in " pleasures of the body " . Nevertheless , Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her . Green suggested that , in the context of the period , Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women , including Ada of Caria , who adopted him , and even Darius ' mother Sisygambis , who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander 's death . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Alexander 's legacy extended beyond his military conquests . His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West , and vast areas to the east were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence . Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers , many surviving into the 21st century . His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched , while the Greeks themselves got a sense of belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean . 
 = = = Hellenistic kingdoms = = = 
 Alexander 's most immediate legacy was the introduction of Macedonian rule to huge new swathes of Asia . At the time of his death , Alexander 's empire covered some 5 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 km2 ( 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sq mi ) , and was the largest state of its time . Many of these areas remained in Macedonian hands or under Greek influence for the next 200 – 300 years . The successor states that emerged were , at least initially , dominant forces , and these 300 years are often referred to as the Hellenistic period . 
 The eastern borders of Alexander 's empire began to collapse even during his lifetime . However , the power vacuum he left in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent directly gave rise to one of the most powerful Indian dynasties in history , the Maurya Empire . Taking advantage of this power vacuum , Chandragupta Maurya ( referred to in Greek sources as " <unk> " ) , of relatively humble origin , took control of the Punjab , and with that power base proceeded to conquer the Nanda Empire . 
 = = = Founding of cities = = = 
 Over the course of his conquests , Alexander founded some twenty cities that bore his name , most of them east of the Tigris . The first , and greatest , was Alexandria in Egypt , which would become one of the leading Mediterranean cities . The cities ' locations reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions . At first , the cities must have been inhospitable , little more than defensive garrisons . Following Alexander 's death , many Greeks who had settled there tried to return to Greece . However , a century or so after Alexander 's death , many of the <unk> were thriving , with elaborate public buildings and substantial populations that included both Greek and local peoples . 
 = = = Hellenization = = = 
 Hellenization was coined by the German historian Johann Gustav <unk> to denote the spread of Greek language , culture , and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander 's conquest . That this export took place is undoubted , and can be seen in the great Hellenistic cities of , for instance , Alexandria , Antioch and Seleucia ( south of modern Baghdad ) . Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into Persian culture and attempted to hybridize Greek and Persian culture . This culminated in his aspiration to <unk> the populations of Asia and Europe . However , his successors explicitly rejected such policies . Nevertheless , Hellenization occurred throughout the region , accompanied by a distinct and opposite ' <unk> ' of the successor states . 
 The core of the Hellenistic culture promulgated by the conquests was essentially Athenian . The close association of men from across Greece in Alexander 's army directly led to the emergence of the largely Attic @-@ based " koine " , or " common " Greek dialect . Koine spread throughout the Hellenistic world , becoming the lingua franca of Hellenistic lands and eventually the ancestor of modern Greek . Furthermore , town planning , education , local government , and art current in the Hellenistic period were all based on Classical Greek ideals , evolving into distinct new forms commonly grouped as Hellenistic . Aspects of Hellenistic culture were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid @-@ 15th century . 
 Some of the most pronounced effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India , in the region of the relatively late @-@ rising Greco @-@ Bactrian Kingdom ( 250 BC @-@ 125 BC ) ( in modern Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Tajikistan ) and the Indo @-@ Greek Kingdom ( 180 BC - 10 CE ) in modern Afghanistan and India . There on the newly formed Silk Road Greek culture apparently hybridized with Indian , and especially Buddhist culture . The resulting syncretism known as Greco @-@ Buddhism heavily influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of Greco @-@ Buddhist art . These Greco @-@ Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China , Sri Lanka , and the Mediterranean ( Greco @-@ Buddhist monasticism ) . Some of the first and most influential figurative portrayals of the Buddha appeared at this time , perhaps modeled on Greek statues of Apollo in the Greco @-@ Buddhist style . Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion : the concept of <unk> is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes , and some Mahayana ceremonial practices ( burning incense , gifts of flowers , and food placed on altars ) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks ; however , similar practices were also observed amongst the native Indic culture . One Greek king , Menander I , probably became Buddhist , and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as ' <unk> ' . The process of Hellenization also spurred trade between the east and west . For example , Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the Greco @-@ Bactrian city of Ai <unk> in modern @-@ day Afghanistan , while the Greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the long @-@ standing Indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain ( Mount Meru ) like the petals of a flower . The <unk> ( lit . Greek astronomical treatise ) and <unk> Siddhanta texts depict the influence of Greek astronomical ideas on Indian astronomy . 
 = = = Influence on Rome = = = 
 Alexander and his exploits were admired by many Romans , especially generals , who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements . Polybius began his Histories by reminding Romans of Alexander 's achievements , and thereafter Roman leaders saw him as a role model . Pompey the Great adopted the epithet " Magnus " and even Alexander 's <unk> @-@ type haircut , and searched the conquered lands of the east for Alexander 's 260 @-@ year @-@ old cloak , which he then wore as a sign of greatness . Julius Caesar dedicated a <unk> equestrian bronze statue but replaced Alexander 's head with his own , while Octavian visited Alexander 's tomb in Alexandria and temporarily changed his seal from a sphinx to Alexander 's profile . The emperor Trajan also admired Alexander , as did Nero and Caracalla . The <unk> , a Roman family that in the person of Macrinus briefly ascended to the imperial throne , kept images of Alexander on their persons , either on jewelry , or embroidered into their clothes . 
 On the other hand , some Roman writers , particularly Republican figures , used Alexander as a cautionary tale of how autocratic tendencies can be kept in check by republican values . Alexander was used by these writers as an example of ruler values such as <unk> ( friendship ) and clementia ( clemency ) , but also <unk> ( anger ) and <unk> gloriae ( over @-@ desire for glory ) . 
 = = = Legend = = = 
 Legendary accounts surround the life of Alexander the Great , many deriving from his own lifetime , probably encouraged by Alexander himself . His court historian Callisthenes portrayed the sea in Cilicia as drawing back from him in proskynesis . Writing shortly after Alexander 's death , another participant , Onesicritus , invented a tryst between Alexander and <unk> , queen of the mythical Amazons . When Onesicritus read this passage to his patron , Alexander 's general and later King Lysimachus reportedly quipped , " I wonder where I was at the time . " 
 In the first centuries after Alexander 's death , probably in Alexandria , a quantity of the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the Alexander Romance , later falsely ascribed to Callisthenes and therefore known as Pseudo @-@ Callisthenes . This text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages , containing many dubious stories , and was translated into numerous languages . 
 = = = In ancient and modern culture = = = 
 Alexander the Great 's accomplishments and legacy have been depicted in many cultures . Alexander has figured in both high and popular culture beginning in his own era to the present day . The Alexander Romance , in particular , has had a significant impact on portrayals of Alexander in later cultures , from Persian to medieval European to modern Greek . 
 Alexander features prominently in modern Greek folklore , more so than any other ancient figure . The colloquial form of his name in modern Greek ( " O <unk> " ) is a household name , and he is the only ancient hero to appear in the <unk> shadow play . One well @-@ known fable among Greek seamen involves a solitary mermaid who would grasp a ship 's prow during a storm and ask the captain " Is King Alexander alive ? " . The correct answer is " He is alive and well and rules the world ! " , causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm . Any other answer would cause the mermaid to turn into a raging Gorgon who would drag the ship to the bottom of the sea , all hands aboard . 
 In pre @-@ Islamic Middle Persian ( Zoroastrian ) literature , Alexander is referred to by the epithet <unk> , meaning " accursed " , and is accused of destroying temples and burning the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism . In Islamic Iran , under the influence of the Alexander Romance ( in Persian : <unk> <unk> ) , a more positive portrayal of Alexander emerges . <unk> 's Shahnameh ( " The Book of Kings " ) includes Alexander in a line of legitimate Iranian <unk> , a mythical figure who explored the far reaches of the world in search of the Fountain of Youth . Later Persian writers associate him with philosophy , portraying him at a symposium with figures such as Socrates , Plato and Aristotle , in search of immortality . 
 The Syriac version of the Alexander Romance portrays him as an ideal Christian world conqueror who prayed to " the one true God " . In Egypt , Alexander was portrayed as the son of Nectanebo II , the last pharaoh before the Persian conquest . His defeat of Darius was depicted as Egypt 's salvation , " proving " Egypt was still ruled by an Egyptian . 
 The figure of Dhul @-@ <unk> ( literally " the Two @-@ Horned One " ) mentioned in the Quran is believed by some scholars to represent Alexander , due to parallels with the Alexander Romance . In this tradition , he was a heroic figure who built a wall to defend against the nations of Gog and Magog . He then traveled the known world in search for the Water of Life and Immortality , eventually becoming a prophet . 
 In Hindi and Urdu , the name " Sikandar " , derived from Persian , denotes a rising young talent . In medieval Europe he was made a member of the Nine Worthies , a group of heroes who encapsulated all the ideal qualities of chivalry . 
 = = Historiography = = 
 Apart from a few inscriptions and fragments , texts written by people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander were all lost . Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander 's campaign historian Callisthenes ; Alexander 's generals Ptolemy and Nearchus ; Aristobulus , a junior officer on the campaigns ; and Onesicritus , Alexander 's chief helmsman . Their works are lost , but later works based on these original sources have survived . The earliest of these is Diodorus Siculus ( 1st century BC ) , followed by Quintus Curtius Rufus ( mid @-@ to @-@ late 1st century AD ) , Arrian ( 1st to 2nd century AD ) , the biographer Plutarch ( 1st to 2nd century AD ) , and finally Justin , whose work dated as late as the 4th century . Of these , Arrian is generally considered the most reliable , given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources , closely followed by Diodorus .

 = Well Dunn = 
 Well Dunn , also known as The Southern Rockers , was a professional wrestling tag team that competed in several promotions in the United States . The team was composed of Rex King and Steve Doll , and the team name " Well Dunn " was a play on the term " well done " . Accordingly , King wrestled as " Timothy Well " and Doll as " Steven Dunn " . King and Doll held championships in Pacific Northwest Wrestling ( PNW ) , the United States Wrestling Association ( USWA ) , the World Wrestling Council ( WWC ) , and Music City Wrestling ( MCW ) . 
 They are best known , however , for competing in the World Wrestling Federation from 1993 to 1995 . In the WWF , Well Dunn faced the promotion 's top tag teams and were contenders for the WWF Tag Team Championship . They had a feud with The Bushwhackers that lasted for most of Well Dunn 's tenure with the company . The team split up in 1996 but reunited briefly in 1998 . During this reunion , Doll attacked King and the team disbanded permanently . Doll died from complications related to a blood clot in 2009 .

 Prior to teaming with Rex King , Steve Doll competed in Pacific Northwest Wrestling with partner Scott Peterson as the Southern Rockers . The team was fashioned after The Rock ' n ' Roll Express , and Doll and Peterson held the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship together seven times . In 1989 , Doll replaced Peterson with King . They won the tag team title by defeating Scotty the Body and The Grappler on August 26 . After an inconclusive rematch on September 9 , the title was vacated and another rematch was ordered ; the Southern Rockers regained the belts one week later . They held the title until PNW ordered it vacated again on November 4 after a match against Brian Adams and Jeff Warner ; once again , Doll and King won a rematch the following week to regain the championship . They dropped the title to Adams and The Grappler on December 14 but regained the belts by winning a rematch on January 27 , 1990 . 
 In February 1990 , the Southern Rockers vacated the championship and left PNW . They began competing for the United States Wrestling Association , where they quickly won the USWA World Tag Team Championship . Three days after winning the title belts , King and Doll dropped them to Robert Fuller and Brian Lee . They regained them six days later , however . On April 28 , they lost the title to The Uptown Posse but were able to regain it less than a month later . On June 2 , King competed in a handicap match , in which he faced The Dirty White Boys ( Tony Anthony and Tom Burton ) . Unable to defeat both men , he lost the match and the championship . 
 Doll returned to PNW , where he held the tag team title another seven times with various partners . King remained in Tennessee , winning the USWA World Tag Team Championship with Joey Maggs . He later moved to Puerto Rico , where he wrestled for the World Wrestling Council . With Ricky Santana as his new partner , he held the WWC World Tag Team Championship twice . The team split up in May 1992 when Santana did not appear for a match to determine the winners of the vacant tag team title . 
 = = = Reunion = = = 
 The following month , Doll and King reunited to win the WWC World Tag Team Championship from Doug Masters and Ron Starr . On August 1 , the title was vacated due to a controversial finish in a match against a tag team known as Solid Gold . King replaced Doll with Ray González to win the vacant title . The team got back together again in the USWA , where they defeated The Moondogs to win the tag team belts for a fourth time together . 
 Due to an interpromotional agreement between the USWA and the World Wrestling Federation , Doll and King wrestled at several events alongside WWF wrestlers . While in Tennessee , the team showed a " blatant disregard for the rules " and were involved in a storyline in which they were suspended indefinitely from the USWA as a result . On June 15 , 1993 , they wrestled in their first official WWF match and defeated the team of Tito Santana and Virgil . It was in the WWF that Well Dunn " first experienced widespread fame " . In the WWF , they continued to wrestle as heels ( rule breakers ) and were described as " among the sneakiest and most cunning " teams in the promotion . 
 = = = WWF ( 1993 ) = = = 
 The team signed with the WWF and took on the new name Well Dunn , with Doll competing as Steven Dunn and King wrestling under the name Timothy Well . They wore bow ties in addition to wrestling <unk> with thongs over top . This led wrestling author RD Reynolds to state that the team was " proof positive that bow ties and thongs do not match " . The team made its WWF television debut on the July 18 , 1993 episode of All @-@ American Wrestling , teaming with Blake Beverly in a loss to Tatanka and The Steiner Brothers . They continued to face the WWF 's top face ( fan favorite ) tag teams , including The Smoking Gunns and Men on a Mission . 
 In August , manager Harvey Wippleman began appearing with the team . On the October 10 episode of All @-@ American Wrestling , they defeated Smoky Mountain Wrestling Tag Team Champions The Rock ' n ' Roll Express by countout but did not win the championship . On October 8 , 1993 , Well Dunn wrestled their first match against The Bushwhackers , who became the team 's longtime rivals . During a match against Men on a Mission , Timothy Well sustained an injury . This forced the team out of action in the WWF for several months , although they did return to competing in Tennessee . 
 = = = WWF ( 1994 ) = = = 
 Upon their return to the WWF , Well Dunn had a short series of matches against WWF Tag Team Champions The Headshrinkers , including a match televised on WWF Wrestling Challenge . Well Dunn became involved in a storyline in which Adam Bomb , who was also managed by Wippleman , turned on the manager and began wrestling as a face . On the August 13 episode of WWF Superstars , Well wrestled a singles match against Bomb ; Dunn interfered , and Bomb attacked Well Dunn and Wippleman after the match . This led to a blow off match one week later , in which Bomb teamed with The Smoking Gunns to defeat Kwang ( another of Wippleman 's wrestlers ) and Well Dunn . On August 17 , the team also served as lumberjacks in a lumberjack match between Bret and Owen Hart . 
 Well Dunn continued to face the top teams in the WWF , including The Smoking Gunns , The Headshrinkers , and the newly formed team of Sparky Plugg and the 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 Kid . When The Smoking Gunns were unable to compete due to the birth of Billy Gunn 's son , Well Dunn competed against The Heavenly Bodies instead ; these matches were unusual , as they pitted heel tag teams against each other . As in 1993 , Well Dunn lost more matches than they won in each series , but they had occasional victories against established tag teams and were often booked to defeat jobber tag teams . 
 On September 29 , Well Dunn began another series of matches against The Bushwhackers . The feud lasted the remainder of the year , although Barry Horowitz substituted for Steven Dunn in several matches when Dunn was unable to appear . The Bushwhackers were victorious in the majority of matches , but Well Dunn won occasional matches . One of these matches was featured on the Coliseum Video release Wham Bam Bodyslam , and another two were televised on Monday Night Raw . During one of the Monday Night Raw matches , The Bushwhackers were accompanied by ring announcer Howard Finkel , who had a long @-@ standing rivalry with Wippleman . Finkel and Wippleman had an argument during the match that led to a tuxedo match , in which Finkel was declared the winner after stripping Wippleman to his underwear .

Eliminated from the tournament , Well and Dunn competed individually in the Royal Rumble match , a battle royal . Well was eliminated by Davey Boy Smith , and Dunn was eliminated by Aldo Montoya . After The Smoking Gunns regained the championship , Well Dunn challenged for the belts in a series of matches but was unable to win the title . 
 Well Dunn continued to face the WWF 's top tag teams , including The Bushwhackers and The Blu Brothers but were unable to win any of these matches . The team 's final WWF match came in a loss to The Allied Powers , after which Well Dunn disappeared from the WWF .

 " Itchy & Scratchy : The Movie " is the sixth episode of The Simpsons ' fourth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 3 , 1992 . The plot follows Bart continually getting in trouble , and how Homer is unable to give him any suitable punishment . Marge gets Homer to agree to make a punishment stick , and he forbids Bart to see the new Itchy & Scratchy movie , a punishment that Homer takes very seriously . It was written by John Swartzwelder and was directed by Rich Moore . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Marge and Homer attend a parent @-@ teacher night at Springfield Elementary School . Although Ms. Hoover tells Homer that Lisa is doing well , Ms. Krabappel tells Marge that Bart is continually causing trouble . Urging Homer and Marge to enforce stronger discipline on Bart with the idea that he could grow up to become a Supreme Court Justice if he turns his life around , the two return home to find that Bart stole and broke Grampa 's false teeth . Therefore , Bart is sent up to his room without dinner as punishment , but Homer sneaks up and brings him some pizza , making Bart promise to behave . However , Bart continues to get in trouble and Homer 's attempts to discipline him fail . Eventually he promises Marge to make the next punishment stick . 
 It is announced that there will be an Itchy & Scratchy Movie and in anticipation , Bart buys himself a ticket . Later on , Bart is left to babysit Maggie and he neglects to watch her as he is distracted by the history of Itchy & Scratchy , leaving her to take Homer 's car for a joyride and crash into the wall of Springfield Prison , releasing the prisoners . Therefore , Homer angrily blames Bart and punishes him by banning him from ever seeing The Itchy & Scratchy Movie . He tears up Bart 's ticket to prove that he means business . Bart begs to be given another punishment , but Homer refuses . After the film 's release , Bart becomes angry and sad that he is the only kid in Springfield who has not seen it . Two months later , the film is still being shown in theaters as Marge and Lisa beg Homer to change his mind , with Marge claiming Bart has been punished enough . However , Homer still denies this and makes the punishment stick . Bart attempts to secretly watch the film by paying for a ticket , but finds out that Homer went to the theater and requested that the employees there not sell a ticket to him . Eventually , the film is removed from theaters and Bart tells Homer he won , to which Homer replies by saying they both won because by using his punishment Bart is in no doubt headed for a better life . 
 40 years later , Bart , now Chief Justice of the United States , and Homer , a senior citizen , walk down the street and discover the film is back in the local theater as a classic re @-@ release . Homer decides that Bart has learned his lesson and the two watch the movie happily together .

 This episode , like many other Itchy & Scratchy themed episodes , was written by John Swartzwelder , although the plot was originally pitched by Sam Simon . During the table read of the script , the first act received many laughs , but the second act got little positive reaction , leading Al Jean to believe that the script would require a huge rewrite , although the third act also received a positive reaction . For The Itchy & Scratchy Movie shown at the end of the episode , Mike Reiss felt that it should top all other Itchy & Scratchy cartoons in terms of violence , and John Swartzwelder wrote the " most disturbing , horrible sequence " , none of which was used . 
 This was the first episode that Rich Moore directed at Film Roman . The shot of the Korean animation studio angered the Korean animators at Rough Draft Korea ; Gregg Vanzo , the overseas director , felt insulted and nearly sent the scene back . While drawing the Steamboat Itchy sequence , the animators jokingly referred to it as " Steamboat Lawsuit " . David Silverman explained that he did not know " why [ they ] weren 't sued because there 's a shot right out of Steamboat Willie in [ the episode ] . " 
 The episode features the first appearance of Bumblebee Man , who is a caricature of " El <unk> Colorado " ( " The Red Grasshopper " ) , a character created and portrayed by Mexican television comedian Roberto Gómez Bolaños .

 During the fourth season , The Simpsons usually aired on a Thursday , but " Itchy & Scratchy : The Movie " aired on a Tuesday because the executives at Fox had wanted to air an episode during the 1992 presidential election results because they felt it would mean increased ratings . Instead , the episode dropped from its normal audience . " Itchy & Scratchy : The Movie " finished 25th in ratings for the week of November 2 – 8 , 1992 , with a Nielsen rating of 12 @.@ 5 , equivalent to approximately 11 @.@ 6 million viewing households . It was the third highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , following The Simpsons episode " Marge Gets a Job " , which aired in the same week on the usual Thursday , and Beverly Hills , 90210 . In the Spring of 2002 , the episode was released in the United Kingdom on a DVD collection titled The Simpsons Film Festival , along with the season eleven episode " Beyond Blunderdome " , the season seven episode " 22 Short Films About Springfield " , and the season six episode " A Star Is Burns " . 
 Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide called it a " superb episode " , especially " [ Homer ] ' s suggestion for punishing Bart 's misbehaviour is to give him a present , and his trick for avoiding jury duty is ' to say you 're prejudiced against all races .

In 2014 , The Simpsons writers picked " Steamboat Itchy " from this episode as one of their nine favorite " Itchy & Stratchy " episodes of all time . 
 = United States v. More = 
 United States v. More , 7 U.S. 159 ( 1805 ) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that it had no jurisdiction to hear appeals from criminal cases in the circuit courts by writs of error . Relying on the Exceptions Clause , More held that Congress 's enumerated grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress 's power to eliminate all other forms of appellate jurisdiction . 
 The second of forty @-@ one criminal cases heard by the Marshall Court , More ensured that the Court 's criminal jurisprudence would be limited to writs of error from the state ( and later , territorial ) courts , original habeas petitions and writs of error from habeas petitions in the circuit courts , and certificates of division and mandamus from the circuit courts . Congress did not grant the Court jurisdiction to hear writs of error from the circuit courts in criminal cases until 1889 , for capital crimes , and 1891 , for other " infamous " crimes . The Judicial Code of 1911 abolished the circuit courts , transferred the trial of crimes to the district courts , and extended the Court 's appellate jurisdiction to all crimes . But , these statutory grants were construed not to permit writs of error filed by the prosecution , as in More . 
 More arose from the same Federalist / Jeffersonian political dispute over the judiciary that gave rise to Marbury v. Madison ( 1803 ) and Stuart v. Laird ( 1803 ) . Benjamin More , a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia , argued that the repeal of statutory provisions authorizing compensation for his office violated the salary @-@ protection guarantees for federal judges in Article Three of the United States Constitution . Below , a divided panel of the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia had sided with More , interpreted the repeal act prospectively , and sustained his demurrer to the criminal indictment for the common law crime of exacting illegal fees under color of office . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = United States presidential election , 1800 = = = 
 The Federalist Party and the Democratic @-@ Republican Party comprised the First Party System in the United States . Democratic @-@ Republican Thomas Jefferson defeated Federalist John Adams in the 1800 presidential election . Jefferson 's party also took control of Congress in the House and Senate elections . After the elections , the lame duck Federalist administration passed the Judiciary Act of 1801 ( the " Midnight Judges Act " ) , creating 16 new circuit judgeships to preside in the circuit courts ( as opposed to the district judges and the Supreme Court justices riding circuit ) . Along with the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 ( the " Organic Act " ) , the statutes created many judicial vacancies , and Adams filled nearly all of these judgeships on his last day in office . Marshall , in his dual role as Adams ' Secretary of State , failed to deliver some of these commissions before leaving office . 
 = = = Companion cases = = = 
 Immediately after his inauguration , Jefferson instructed his Secretary of State , James Madison , to stop delivery on all outstanding commissions . Further , an act of March 8 , 1802 the abolished the circuit court judgeships created by the Midnight Judges Act ( 15 of which had already been filled ) , restoring the system created under the 1789 and 1793 acts . Federalists viewed this as unconstitutional and looked to the then @-@ pending case of Marbury v. Madison — concerning a confirmed D.C. justice of the peace who had not received his commission — as a test case for the constitutionality of the repeal . The next session of the Supreme Court was in June , one month before the repeal would take effect . But , the Judiciary Act of 1802 delayed the Court 's next session until February 1803 , and made other changes to the structure of the judicial system . 
 More broadly , Jefferson removed 146 of 316 ( 46 % ) incumbent , second @-@ level , appointed federal officials , including 13 U.S. Attorneys and 18 U.S. Marshals . Jefferson also displaced two district judges — Ray Greene and Jacob Read — citing technical flaws in their appointments . Further , District Judge John Pickering was impeached and removed from office on a party @-@ line vote . The following day , the House impeached Justice Samuel Chase , but six Democratic @-@ Republicans crossed party lines in the Senate to prevent his conviction by a single vote . 
 In Marbury , the Supreme Court held that Madison 's failure to deliver the commission to Marbury was illegal , but did not grant Marbury a writ of mandamus on the ground that § 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional insofar as it authorized the Court to issue such writs under its original jurisdiction . Stuart v. Laird — involving a civil judgment rendered by a circuit court constituted under the Midnight Judges Act and enforced by a circuit court constituted under the Judiciary Act of 1802 — challenged the constitutionality both of abolishing the circuit judgeships and of requiring the Supreme Court justices to ride circuit . In a brief opinion , the Court rejected both challenges . 
 = = = District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 = = = 
 Both the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and the D.C. justices of the peace were created on February 27 , 1801 by the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 . Unlike its better @-@ known predecessor , the Midnight Judges Act , the Organic Act survived repeal by the Jeffersonian Congress . 
 = = = = D.C. justices of the peace = = = = 
 The D.C. justices of the peace were appointed by the President , in a number at his discretion , and confirmed by the Senate for five @-@ year terms . A D.C. justice of the peace had jurisdiction over " all matters , civil and criminal , and in whatever relates to the conservation of the peace " within their county . The District of Columbia was divided into two counties : Washington County , east of the Potomac River , and Alexandria County , west of the Potomac . Justices of the peace were authorized to " inflict whipping , imprisonment , and fine as high as 500 pounds of tobacco " and to hear civil cases with an amount in controversy up to $ 20 . One year after More , in Ex parte Burford ( 1806 ) , the Marshall Court 's first original habeas case , the Court granted a writ of habeas corpus to a prisoner subjected to preventive detention by the D.C. justices of the peace . 
 As to compensation , the Organic Act provided that justices of the peace " shall be entitled to receive for their services the fees allowed for like services by the laws herein before adopted and continued , in the eastern part of said district . " A March 3 , 1801 amendment to the Organic Act provided that : " [ T ] he magistrates , to be appointed for the said district , shall be and they are hereby constituted a board of commissioners within their respective counties , and shall possess and exercise the same powers , perform the same duties , receive the same fees and <unk> , as the levy courts or commissioners of county for the state of Maryland possess , perform and receive . . . . " 
 On March 4 , 1801 , President John Adams 's last day in office , Adams nominated and the Senate confirmed 20 D.C. justices of the peace for Washington County and 19 for Alexandria County . On March 16 , President Thomas Jefferson issued 15 commissions to justices of the peace in Washington County , including 13 nominated by Adams , and 15 in Alexandria County , including 11 nominated by Adams ; the remainder were of his own choosing . ( Jefferson 's list , submitted to the Senate on January 6 , 1802 , erroneously contained the name of John Laird , a confirmed Adams appointed who had not received a commission from Jefferson , instead of More . ) The plaintiffs in Marbury v. Madison ( 1803 ) — William Marbury , Dennis Ramsay , Robert Townsend Hooe , and William Harper — were among the confirmed Adams nominees not commissioned . 
 On May 3 , 1802 , Congress eliminated both the fees for justice of the peace services , except travel expenses , authorized by the Organic Act and fees associated with the justices of the peace 's role on the board of commissioners . These two sources represented the entirety of their compensation . 
 = = = = D.C. circuit court = = = = 
 The three @-@ judge United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia was populated by its own judges , rather than by a mixture of district judges and circuit riding Supreme Court justices like the other circuit courts . The D.C. circuit court had jurisdiction over crimes committed within the district . With regard to appeals from the D.C. circuit court , the Organic Act provided : 
 [ A ] ny final judgment , order or decree in said circuit court , wherein the matter in dispute , exclusive of costs , shall exceed the value of one hundred dollars , may be re @-@ examined and reversed or affirmed in the supreme court of the United States , by writ of error or appeal , which shall be prosecuted in the same manner , under the same regulations , and the same proceedings shall be had therein , as is or shall be provided in the case of writs of error on judgments , or appeals upon orders or decrees , rendered in the circuit court of the United States . 
 The provision to which the Organic Act referred , that for writs of error from the circuit courts to the Supreme Court in the Judiciary Act of 1789 , provided : 
 And upon a like process [ as a writ of error from the district court to the circuit court ] , may final judgments and decrees in civil actions , and suits in equity in a circuit court , brought there by original process , or removed there from courts of the several States , or removed there by appeal from a district court where the matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of two thousand dollars , exclusive of costs , be re @-@ examined and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court , the citation being in such case signed by a judge of such circuit court , or justice of the Supreme Court , and the adverse party having at least thirty days ’ notice . 
 Unlike the appellate provision of the Judiciary Act of 1789 , the appellate provision of the act of February 27 , 1801 was not explicitly limited to civil cases ( except insofar as it incorporated the former by reference ) . Further , because the D.C. circuit court was not constituted within the framework of the Judiciary Act of 1802 , appeals to the Supreme Court by way of certificates of division could not issue . After More , the Marshall Court heard six appeals from the D.C. circuit court via original habeas . 
 = = = Criminal appeals = = = 
 The availability of criminal appeals to the Supreme Court by means of writs of error from the circuit courts was perhaps an open question prior to More . In England , the writ of error was available as of right in misdemeanor cases , but , in felony cases , required the express consent of the prosecutor . 
 The legislative history of the Judiciary Act of 1789 reveals little consideration of criminal appeals . Caleb Strong , a Senator at the time of its drafting , described § 22 of that act as follows : " Writs of Error from the Circuit to the <unk> . Court in all Causes not criminal of which the Circuit Court has original <unk> and the Matter in Dispute does not exceed 2000 <unk> . " Senator ( and future Supreme Court justice ) William Paterson noticed the lack of provision for criminal appeals in preliminary notes and a draft outline of a speech he gave on June 23 , 1789 . According to Rossman , Paterson may have viewed the inability of the government to appeal ( to a court in the nation 's capitol ) as a " protection for ordinary citizens . " The issue of criminal appeals was not mentioned in the House debates . 
 Shortly after the Judiciary Act of 1789 took effect , Attorney General Edmund Randolph proposed , in a report to the House of Representatives , a criminal appeal similar to that in England : a writ of error as of right in non @-@ capital cases , and no writs of error in capital cases . Randolph 's report was referred to the Committee of the Whole , which took no action . 
 Prior to Marshall 's tenure , the Supreme Court had heard only two criminal cases — both by prerogative writ . First , in United States v. Hamilton ( 1795 ) , the Court granted bail to a capital defendant — as it was authorized to do by § 33 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and § 4 of the Judiciary Act of 1793 . The greater portion of the decision was dedicated to the Court 's refusal to order the case tried by a special circuit court , as was provided for by § 3 of the Judiciary Act of 1793 . In Ex parte Bollman ( 1807 ) , the Court explained that its jurisdiction in Hamilton could only have been exercised via original habeas under § 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 . Second , in United States v. Lawrence ( 1795 ) , the Court declined to issue a writ of mandamus to compel a district judge to order the arrest of a deserter of the French navy . In one criminal trial , United States v. Callender ( C.C.D. Va . 1800 ) , Justice Samuel Chase ( who expressed no dissent in More ) wrote : 
 [ I ] f I am not right , it is an error in judgment , and you can state the proceedings on the record so as to show any error , and I shall be the first man to grant you the benefit a new trial by granting you a writ of error in the supreme court . 
 In United States v. Simms ( 1803 ) , the Court heard a writ of error , brought by the United States , on the merits from a criminal case in the D.C. circuit court . Simms was the first such case , and after Simms , the next criminal writ of error heard by the Court was More . U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia John T. Mason argued both Simms and More . 
 = = Indictments = = 
 Benjamin More was one of two of D.C. justices of peace in Alexandria County of Jefferson 's own choosing , receiving an interim appointment . Jefferson proceeded to nominate More for a full five @-@ year term , and the Senate confirmed More on April 27 , 1802 . According to O 'Fallon , " More appears to have been a man of moderate Jeffersonian sentiments and attachments , who nonetheless joined in a Federalist defense of judicial independence . " He was " an unlikely character for the lead role in a Federalist attack on Jeffersonian principles . " O 'Fallon hypothesizes that More 's case was intended as a test case by all parties involved . " More has all the markings of a trumped @-@ up case , manufactured to present the Supreme Court with the issues of principle raised by the repeal , without the embarrassment of direct conflict with the Executive . " 
 More was indicted by the Grand Inquest for the County of Washington , during its July term , for taking unlawful fees for his services as a justice of the peace . The indictment charged More with having taken the fees on July 17 and 24 . A capias , returnable at the December 1802 term , was issued . The members of the Inquest included five other D.C. justices of the peace : Daniel Carrol , Daniel <unk> , Joseph Sprigg Belt , Thomas Corcoran , and Anthony <unk> . Another member of the Inquest was Thomas Beall , a confirmed Adams appointee who had not received a commission from Jefferson . 
 More was indicted a second time at the December term for conduct on December 10 , 1802 . More <unk> , and the case was continued until the July 1803 term . Only the latter indictment was mentioned in the United States Reports . 
 More 's demurrer was opposed by U.S. Attorney Mason , a Jefferson appointee . Mason argued that the D.C. justices of the peace were Article I judges established pursuant to Congress 's enumerated power over the District of Columbia in Article One of the United States Constitution . Article One provides that Congress shall have power " [ t ] o exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten Miles square ) as may , by Cession of particular States , and the Acceptance of Congress , become the Seat of the Government of the United States . " Mason advanced a broad view that Congress 's power over the District of Columbia was not limited any other constitutional provision . In support of his argument that the justices of the peace were not Article III judges , Mason argued that their jurisdiction was broader than that permitted by Article III . 
 According to O 'Fallon , there were additional indicia — not cited by either party — that the justices of the peace were not Article III judges . For example , the Organic Act authorized the President to appoint as many justices of the peace as he " shall from time to time think expedient . " This was a broad delegation to the President of Congress 's power " [ t ] o constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court . " 
 More was not indicted under any criminal statue passed by Congress . Rather , his was " an indictment at common law . . . for having , under colour of his office , exacted and taken an illegal fee . " The Organic Act provided that the laws of Maryland and Virginia would continue in force in the portions of the district ceded from those states . Since More was a justice of the peace for Alexandria County , the common law of Virginia would have applied . 
 = = Dismissal = = 
 The D.C. circuit court judges hearing the demurrer were Chief Judge William Kilty and assistant judges William Cranch and James Markham Marshall ( Chief Justice John Marshall 's brother ) . Cranch and Marshall were Adams appointees ; Kilty was a Jefferson appointee . Cranch , also the reporter of decisions for the Supreme Court , included the D.C. circuit court opinions in the margin of his report of the Supreme Court 's decision in More . 
 = = = Majority = = = 
 Cranch , joined by Marshall , sustained More 's demurrer based on the Compensation Clause of Article Three of the United States Constitution . That clause provides : " The Judges , both of the supreme and inferior Courts . . . shall , at stated Times , receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be diminished during their <unk> in Office . " 
 Cranch held that Congress 's power over the federal district was limited by the remainder of the Constitution . In response to Mason 's argument for unfettered power , Cranch replied : " [ T ] his is a doctrine to which I can never assent . Can it be said , that congress may pass a bill of attainder for the district of Columbia ? That congress may pass laws ex post facto in the district , or order soldiers to be quartered upon us in a time of peace , or make our ports free ports of entry , or lay duties upon our exports , or take away the right of trial by jury , in criminal prosecutions ? " 
 Cranch held that More was an Article III judge sitting on a " Tribunal inferior to the supreme Court . " In response to the argument that his jurisdiction exceeded Article Three , Cranch replied that : " The causes of which they have cognizance , are causes arising under the laws of the United States , and , therefore , the power of trying them , is part of the judicial power . . . . " In response to the argument that the fees would never have been paid at a " time Stated , " Cranch replied that : " [ I ] t may , perhaps , be a compliance with the clause of the constitution , which requires that it shall be receivable at stated times , to say that it shall be paid when the service is rendered . And , we are rather to incline to this construction , than to suppose the command of the constitution to have been disobeyed . " Further , Cranch dodged the question of whether a five @-@ year term was consistent with the Good Behavior Clause . " It is unnecessary in this cause to decide the question , whether , as such , he holds his office during good behaviour . . . . " 
 Cranch stopped short of declaring the statute unconstitutional . He merely interpreted it as prospective , holding that it " cannot affect that justice of the peace during his continuance in office ; whatever effect it may have upon those justices who have been appointed to office since the passing of the act . " Contemporary media accounts reported that the circuit court had held that fee @-@ elimination provision of the May 23 , 1802 act unconstitutional , rather than interpreting it as prospective . According to O 'Fallon , this is evidence that Cranch 's published opinion ( as reported by himself ) may have differed from his oral opinion . 
 = = = Dissent = = = 
 Chief Judge Kilty 's dissent noted the recent confirmation of the principle of judicial review in Marbury v. Madison . " According to the course which has been pursued by the supreme court , it appears unnecessary to say any thing about the power of a court to examine into the constitutionality of a law . . . . " Instead , Kilty proceeded by " taking the power for granted . " But , Kilty noted , " [ i ] n testing an act of the legislature by the constitution , nothing less than the positive provisions of the latter can be resorted to . . . . " 
 Kilty briefly argued that More was not an Article III judge and that the fees in question were not compensation received at " times Stated . " But , the bulk of Kilty 's dissent was devoted to the argument that Congress 's power over the federal district was broad . He argued that " the district of Columbia , though belonging to the United States , and within their compass , is not , like a state , a component part , and that the provisions of the constitution , which are applicable particularly to the relative situation of the United States and the several states , are not applicable to this district . " " [ W ] hen congress , in exercising exclusive legislation over this territory , enact laws to give or to take away the fees of the justices of the peace , such laws cannot be tested by a provision in the constitution , evidently applicable to the judicial power of the whole United States , and containing restrictions which cannot , in their nature , affect the situation of the justices , or the nature of the compensation . " 
 Yet , Kilty did not fully accept Mason 's argument that Congress 's power over the district was unlimited . He argued that the word " exclusive " meant only " free from the power exercised by the several states " and that " the legislative power to be exercised by congress may still be subject to the general restraints contained in the constitution . " He admitted that , even within the federal district , Congress was 
 restrained from suspending the writ of habeas corpus , unless in the cases allowed ; from passing ( within and for the district ) a bill of attainder , or ex post facto law ; from laying therein a capitation tax ; from granting therein any title of nobility ; from making therein a law respecting the establishment of religion , or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; and from quartering soldiers therein , contrary to the third amendment . 
 = = Oral argument = = 
 Mason argued the appeal of the United States before the Supreme Court . Samuel Jones argued for More . 
 = = = Merits = = = 
 Jones cited Marbury v. Madison for the proposition that a D.C. justice of the peace does not serve merely at the pleasure of the president . According to O 'Fallon , due to the President 's power to remove most appointees from office , this could only have been a reference to the Good Behavior Clause of Article Three . That clause provides that " Judges , both of the supreme and inferior Courts , shall hold their Offices during good Behavior . " Mason countered that Marbury only held that justices of the peace were entitled to hold their offices for five years of good behavior . 
 Mason again pressed his argument that Congress 's power of the federal district was unlimited : 
 The constitution does not apply to this case . The constitution is a compact between the people of the United States in their individual capacity , and the states in their political capacity . Unfortunately for the citizens of Columbia , they are not in either of these capacities . . . . Congress are under no controul in legislating for the district of Columbia . Their power , in this respect , is unlimited . 
 Marson also argued that More was not an Article III judge because " the judicial power exercised in the district of Columbia , extends to other cases [ than those enumerated in Article III ] , and , therefore , is not the judicial power of the United States . " " It is a power derived from the power given to congress to legislate exclusively in all cases whatsoever over the district . " 
 = = = Jurisdiction = = = 
 On February 13 , sua <unk> , Chief Justice Marshall raised his doubts to the Court 's jurisdiction to entertain criminal appeals . Argument on this question commenced on February 22 . Mason argued in favor of jurisdiction . No argument from More 's counsel on this issue was reported , " although it was typical for the reporter to summarize the arguments on both sides . " 
 Mason acknowledged that , under Clarke v. <unk> ( 1803 ) , the Supreme Court 's appellate jurisdiction required an affirmative grant by Congress . Mason argued that such a grant was found in § 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 ( known as the All Writs Act ) , which authorized the Supreme Court to " issue writs of <unk> <unk> , habeas corpus , and all other writs , not specially provided for by statute , which may be necessary for the exercise of [ its ] jurisdiction , and agreeable to the principles and usages of law . " Mason 's argument based on the All Writs Act was not necessarily limited to the D.C. circuit court . Said Mason : 
 There is no reason why the writ of error should be confined to civil cases . A man 's life , his liberty , and his good name , are as dear to him as his property ; and inferior courts are as liable to err in one case as in the other . There is nothing in the nature of the cases which should make a difference ; nor is it a novel doctrine that a writ of error should lie in a criminal case . They have been frequent in that country from which we have drawn almost all our forms of judicial proceedings . 
 Chief Justice Marshall replied that , if Congress had made no provision for appeals of any kind to the Supreme Court , " your argument would be irresistible . " But , Marshall countered , under the Exceptions Clause , when Congress " has said in what cases a writ of error or appeal shall lie , an exception of all other cases is implied . " The Exceptions Clause provides that " [ i ] n all [ cases other than those in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction ] , the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction , both as to Law and Fact , with such Exceptions , and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make . " 
 Mason replied , first , that the Exceptions Clause did not apply to the federal district , and second , that Organic Act differed from the Judiciary Act of 1789 by referring to " any final judgment , order , or decree , " rather than explicitly limiting appeals to " civil cases . " Mason suggested that the references to the amount in controversy could refer to criminal fines as well as civil judgments . Finally , Mason pointed out that , just two years earlier , in United States v. Simms ( 1803 ) , the Court had reached the merits in a criminal appeal from the same court . Mason himself had argued Simms , and Marshall himself had authored the opinion . 
 In response to the last point , Marshall replied that : " No question was made , in that case , as to the jurisdiction . It passed sub <unk> , and the court does not consider itself as bound by that case . " Mason retorted : " But the traverser [ Simms ] had able counsel , who did not think proper to make the objection . " 
 = = Opinion = = 
 On March 2 , 1805 , writing for a unanimous Court , Chief Justice John Marshall dismissed the writ of error for want of jurisdiction . Justice Johnson was absent from the opinion announcement . 
 Marshall held that the partial statutory grant of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress 's power under the Exceptions Clause to limit the jurisdiction of the Court in all other cases . Marshall noted that " it has never been supposed , that a decision of a circuit court could be reviewed , unless the matter in dispute should exceed the value of 2 @,@ 000 dollars . " Thus , Marshall interpreted the $ 2000 amount in controversy requirement of § 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 as applying to the entire section , rather than only the last antecedent . 
 Marshall rejected the argument that the Organic Act authorized criminal appellate jurisdiction . He interpreted the grant , in light of its $ 100 amount in controversy requirement , as " confined to civil cases . " " The words , ' matter in dispute , ' seem appropriated to civil cases , where the subject in contest has a value beyond the sum mentioned in the act . But , in criminal cases , the question is the guilt or innocence of the accused . And although he may be fined upwards of 100 dollars , yet that is , in the eye of the law , a punishment for the offence committed , and not the particular object of the suit . " 
 A final footnote refers to United States v. La Vengeance ( 1796 ) , " where it seems to be admitted , that in criminal cases the judgment of the inferior court is final . " La Vengeance was an admiralty libel case . There , at oral argument , Attorney General Charles Lee argued , in the alternative , that the case was a " criminal cause " and therefore " should never have been removed to the Circuit Court , the judgment of the District Court being final in criminal causes . " The Court <unk> rejected Lee 's argument : " we are unanimously of opinion , that it is a civil cause : It is a process of the nature of a libel in rem ; and does not , in any degree , touch the persons of the offender . " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After More , no writs of error issued from federal criminal trials in the circuit courts for 84 years . In 1889 , Congress created a right of appeal by writ of error in capital cases . In 1891 , the Judiciary Act of 1891 ( the " Evarts Act " ) extended this right to other serious crimes . The Judicial Code of 1911 abolished the circuit courts and placed original jurisdiction for the trial of all federal crimes in the district courts . Appeal to the courts of appeals by writs of error was provided for all " final decisions , " in civil and criminal cases alike . Appeals to the Supreme Court were permitted directly from the district courts by writ of error , from the courts of appeals on certified questions , and by petition for certiorari . Without reported discussion of the jurisdictional issue , the Court did hear writs of error from criminal cases removed to the circuit courts . ( Recall that the Judiciary Act of 1789 explicitly authorized appeals in removal cases . ) 
 The Supreme Court had other , limited sources of appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases . The Court could hear criminal appeals from the state courts by writ of error , as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789 . The Court could hear federal criminal appeals by certificate of division , as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1802 , original habeas petition , as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789 , and mandamus , as authorized by the same act . Between 1867 and 1868 , and after 1885 , the Court had jurisdiction to hear writs of error from habeas petitions ( a civil action ) in the circuit courts . Beginning in 1850 , the Court also entertained such appeals from the territorial courts . Attempts to utilize other prerogative writs as sources of jurisdiction were unsuccessful . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 More had received far less scholarly attention than Marbury . " The timing and the ground of decision may explain why historians of the battle over repeal have ignored More . " " In a doctrinal summary of constitutional law , More stands only for the proposition that an affirmative grant of appellate jurisdiction by Congress carries with it an implicit negative of jurisdiction within the constitutional description but not mentioned in the grant . " 
 According to O 'Fallon , " More may have been part of a Federalist strategy to get the Court to intervene in the political struggle over the judiciary . " Given that Justice Samuel Chase was acquitted by the Senate in his impeachment case on March 1 , 1805 , the day before the release of the More decision , " [ o ] ne can imagine John Marshall passing a sigh of relief as he handed down the judgment in More . " " [ T ] he dismissal of More marked the end of Federalist efforts to obtain a Supreme Court ruling , directly or by implication , that the repeal of the 1801 Judiciary Act was unconstitutional . " More is of a piece with Marbury and Stuart v. Laird in its avoidance of an opportunity for an open clash with political critics of the courts . It further shares with Marbury the characteristic of declining an exercise of jurisdiction that the Court found to be unwarranted . " O 'Fallon argues : 
 Rather than seize the opportunity presented by More , John Marshall ducked . . . . Without questioning the soundness or propriety of Marshall 's decision , it is worth noting that the Court had previously entertained criminal appeals from the district without raising any such jurisdictional problem . One might reasonably wonder if the Court wanted to avoid a decision on the merits . By March of 1805 , the repeal question had lost its political immediacy , and the impeachment strategy of the Jeffersonians had faltered . There was little to be gained in reopening the sores of the repeal battle . And Marshall may have felt that he had had his say on the critical matters of principle with his opinion in Marbury .

 = = Plot = = 
 Three thousand years ago , an Aztec warlord named Yaotl and his four generals discover a portal opening into a parallel universe which is said to have great power . Yaotl becomes immortal but at a high price , as his four generals were turned to stone . The portal releases thirteen immortal monsters that destroy his army as well as his enemies . In the present , the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have grown apart . After defeating the Shredder , Master Splinter has sent Leonardo to Central America for training . Donatello works as an IT specialist , Michelangelo works as a birthday party entertainer called Cowabunga Carl and Raphael works at night as a vigilante nicknamed Nightwatcher . April O 'Neil operates a company that locates and acquires relics for collectors with the help of her boyfriend , Casey Jones . 
 During a business trip to Central America , April runs into Leonardo and tells him that the turtles have drifted apart . She returns to New York with four statues for her client , Max Winters , the richest man in the city . Upon arrival she calls Casey and tells him that she spoke to Leo and tells him that Leo 's not coming back . However a little later Leo does return , and April and Casey deliver the statues to Winters . Winters hires Karai and the Foot Clan to search the city for the thirteen beasts before the portal opens again . Raphael encounters Casey , who reveals his knowledge of Raphael 's double identity and joins him in hunting criminals . 
 Winters , who is actually the still @-@ immortal Yaotl , reanimates his generals with his company 's advanced technology , but they remain made of stone . Leo returns to the sewer , meeting Splinter . Splinter forbids the Turtles from fighting until they can act as a team again . While training , the Turtles encounter one of the thirteen beasts , Bigfoot , battling the Foot Clan . The Turtles engage Bigfoot , going against Leo and Splinter 's orders . 
 Eventually , the Generals and the Foot Clan captured Bigfoot . When Raphael visits Casey , they encounter the Vampire <unk> and witness her capture by the Foot Clan and the Stone Generals , who spot them and knock Raphael unconscious . Casey takes him back to the apartment while April calls the Turtles for help and reveals the identities of Yaotl and his Generals . After being revived , Raphael suggests they pursue Yaotl , but Leo forbids him to go until Splinter gives out the order and so Raphael goes out to investigate alone as Nightwatcher . 
 Leo , Donny and Mikey return to their sewer home to plan their next move , where Donny discovers the reopening of the portal will be directly over Winters ' skyscraper headquarters . Splinter informs Leo that his team is incomplete , and that he knows what he must do . After eleven monsters have been captured , General Aguila questions Yaotl 's actions . The Generals conspire against Yaotl , wanting to remain immortal . 
 Raphael encounters one of the remaining monsters , the Jersey Devil , at a diner , but drives him off . Leo has been following him , wanting to put an end to the Nightwatcher 's vigilante acts , but when Raph is revealed , they battle . Raph breaks Leo 's twin swords and seems as though he is about to kill him - but then realises the terrible act he was about to commit , and flees . Immediately after Raph leaves , the Generals ambush Leo , who is shot with a poison dart and too weak to fight them . Raph hears him scream in the distance as he 's taken hostage and doubles back in pursuit , but he fails to get there in time . He takes Leo 's broken sabers back to Splinter and explains what happened . 
 The Generals intend to substitute Leo for the thirteenth missing beast and Raphael decides to make amends for his reckless mistakes by rescuing Leo . As the portal opens , Yaotl discovers his Generals ' treachery , while Splinter and the Turtles , accompanied by Casey and April , fight their way through the Foot Clan cordon and breach the tower . Yaotl reveals the truth to the heroes : He wants to be free of his curse of immortality . The Generals reveal that they wish to preserve their immortality , but also to use the portal to bring in more monsters to conquer Earth under their command . 
 Having refused to betray Yaotl in exchange for serving the Generals , April , Casey and the Foot Clan work together , searching for the final monster while the Turtles fight the Generals . Splinter and Yaotl fight off winged portal monsters emerging from the portal . April , Casey and Karai arrive at the tower with the Sea Monster . The Sea Monster crashes into the Generals , dragging them into the portal before it closes for another three thousand years . Karai then warns the gang to enjoy their victory while it lasts , claiming they will soon contend with a familiar face from their past . She and the rest of the Foot Clan depart via smoke bombs . Yaotl , now mortal , honors the Turtles and Splinter , thanking them with his dying breath for fulfilling his lifelong wish . Splinter places Winter 's helmet among his collection of various keepsakes ( items seen in the previous three films such as the time scepter and the ooze canister ) , as well as Raphael 's Nightwatcher helmet and Michelangelo 's turtle costume . The movie ends with Raphael narrating that the Turtles will always be brothers as the four of them jump across the rooftops of New York .

 A computer graphics imagery ( CGI ) TMNT movie was first announced in 2000 , with John Woo supposedly at the helm . That movie languished in development hell and Woo ultimately moved on to other projects . TMNT , executive produced by the TMNT co @-@ creator Peter Laird , is disparate from the previous and subsequent films ' live action style as the only CGI film in the franchise to date . Writer / director Kevin Munroe said that he wanted to do total CGI instead of live action and CGI turtles because it would be easier for the audience to " suspend disbelief for such an offbeat story " as there would be no break in the reality between CGI and live action . Producer Tom Gray explained that the decision to depart from the live action series was due to escalating budgets for the three films , and with each film making less than its predecessor , a CGI film became a reality . For example , the first film made $ 135 @.@ 2 million on a budget of $ 13 @.@ 5 million , and the third made $ 44 million on a budget of $ 21 million . Orange Sky Golden Harvest 's rights to the franchise had expired , and Gray said the question arose there over a CGI TMNT film in 2004 . Munroe stated in terms of the story line that ideas were floated as extreme as the Turtles being in space , but eventually it just came back to New York City , and the theme of the family that had fallen apart . When developing the screenplay , Munroe wanted to take on a less lighthearted tone or " less Cowabunga " and place an emphasis on dark elements as shown in the original comics to appeal to the mature audience . " I had a very specific tone because mixing that sort of action and comedy is a very specific thing . Most people were just coming and wanting to make it too funny . I think that version of the movie could do really well , but we wanted to do something where it sort of pushes the envelope a little bit more and says that animation is more than just comedic animals bumping into each other and farting ! " Munroe said that in design and in the rendering of the animation , he was after the feel of a comic book . Karai was one of Munroe 's favorite characters from the comics and he " was the one who really pushed for Karai " to appear in the film . Development and pre @-@ production for TMNT began in June 2005 at Imagi 's Los Angeles facility and the CGI animation was produced in Hong Kong , followed by post @-@ production in Hollywood . In designing the New York backdrop , art director / concept artist Simon Murton stylized the familiar Manhattan skyline and urban landscapes : " We began with cinematic cues from certain black @-@ and @-@ white films from the 1940s and ' 50s . I really wanted to push the lighting and the environments to create the look and feel of an alternate reality . " The animators that worked on the fight sequences were inspired by Hong Kong action films . Animation director Kim Ooi explains said that because of CGI they were able to " push and stylize beyond the limits of live action . " Imagi used Maya with Pixar ’ s RenderMan for the production pipeline ’ s back @-@ end . Jim Cummings was the only past TMNT actor to appear in this film , where he had previously contributed voice @-@ work in the 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series . The film also features the two voice actors for Ratchet in the Ratchet & Clank series , Mikey Kelley from the first game , and James Arnold Taylor from the others , playing Michelangelo and Leonardo respectively . TMNT was Mako Iwamatsu 's last film before his death . Mako was announced as the voice of Splinter at the San Diego Comic @-@ Con on July 20 , 2006 . He then died the next day . A dedication to Mako appears at the end of the film 's credits . Although Iwamatsu is the only actor credited in the role , Greg Baldwin performs a substantial portion of Splinter 's dialogue in the finished film ; Baldwin had already mimicked Iwamatsu 's voice when he took up the late actor 's role as Iroh in the concurrently @-@ produced cartoon Avatar : The Last Airbender , and used this precedent to successfully lobby to join the cast of TMNT as Splinter following Iwamatsu 's death . Talking about a possible sequel to the film , Munroe said : 
 Shredder – it would be cool to see . I ’ d love to see us explore the Karai and Foot Ninja thing a little more . I love the Rat King , even though it ’ s such a ‘ one @-@ <unk> ’ villain , but I still think it would be kind of cool to go back to him . [ ... ] I ’ d love to – and this is sort of the ‘ out there ’ one , as I don ’ t think it would work for our next sequel – the idea of the <unk> . I think that would be really fun – the idea of traveling to that planet or them invading or something . [ ... ] We come up with ideas for Peter [ Laird ] . ‘ Okay , Pete , they time @-@ travel back , and they go to Mayan culture , and they fight aliens , who just happen to be teleporting back at the same time . ’ And he ’ s like , ‘ Eh , we did it in 1992 . ’ Stuff like that . I mean , they ’ ve been everywhere . There ’ s so much source material .

 Canis Major / <unk> <unk> / is a constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere . In the second century , it was included in Ptolemy 's 48 constellations , and is counted among the 88 modern constellations . Its name is Latin for " greater dog " in contrast to Canis Minor , the " lesser dog " ; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of Orion the hunter through the sky . The Milky Way passes through Canis Major and several open clusters lie within its borders , most notably M41 . 
 Canis Major contains Sirius , the brightest star in the night sky , known as the " dog star " . It is bright because of its proximity to the Solar System . In contrast , the other bright stars of the constellation are stars of great distance and high luminosity . At magnitude 1 @.@ 5 , Epsilon Canis Majoris ( Adhara ) is the second brightest star of the constellation and the brightest source of extreme ultraviolet radiation in the night sky . Next in brightness are the yellow @-@ white supergiant Delta ( Wezen ) at 1 @.@ 8 , the blue @-@ white giant Beta ( Mirzam ) at 2 @.@ 0 , blue @-@ white supergiants Eta ( Aludra ) at 2 @.@ 4 and Omicron1 at 3 @.@ 0 , and white spectroscopic binary Zeta ( <unk> ) , also at 3 @.@ 0 .

 In ancient Mesopotamia , Sirius , named <unk> by the Babylonians , was seen as an arrow aiming towards Orion , while the southern stars of Canis Major and a part of Puppis were viewed as a bow , named BAN in the Three Stars Each tablets , dating to around 1100 BC . In the later compendium of Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled MUL.APIN , the arrow , Sirius , was also linked with the warrior Ninurta , and the bow with Ishtar , daughter of Enlil . Ninurta was linked to the later deity Marduk , who was said to have slain the ocean goddess Tiamat with a great bow , and worshipped as the principal deity in Babylon . The Ancient Greeks replaced the bow and arrow depiction with that of a dog . 
 In Greek Mythology , Canis Major represented the dog Laelaps , a gift from Zeus to Europa ; or sometimes the hound of <unk> , Diana 's nymph ; or the one given by Aurora to Cephalus , so famed for its speed that Zeus elevated it to the sky . It was also considered to represent one of Orion 's hunting dogs , pursuing Lepus the Hare or helping Orion fight Taurus the Bull ; and is referred to in this way by <unk> , Homer and Hesiod . The ancient Greeks refer only to one dog , but by Roman times , Canis Minor appears as Orion 's second dog . Alternative names include Canis <unk> and Canis Alter . Canis <unk> was the name used in the 1521 Alfonsine tables . 
 The Roman myth refers to Canis Major as Custos Europae , the dog guarding Europa but failing to prevent her abduction by Jupiter in the form of a bull , and as Janitor <unk> , " the watchdog " . In medieval Arab astronomy , the constellation became Al Kalb al Akbar , " the Greater Dog " , transcribed as <unk> <unk> by 17th century writer Edmund Chilmead . Islamic scholar Abū <unk> al @-@ Bīrūnī referred to Orion as Al Kalb al <unk> , " the Dog of the Giant " . Among the <unk> of Tunisia , shepherds note six constellations that mark the passage of the dry , hot season .

 In Chinese astronomy , the modern constellation of Canis Major lies in the Vermilion Bird ( <unk> , <unk> Fāng Zhū <unk> ) , where the stars were classified in several separate <unk> of stars . The Military Market ( <unk> <unk> ) was a circular pattern of stars containing <unk> , Beta , <unk> and <unk> , and some stars from Lepus . The Wild Cockerel ( <unk> <unk> ) was at the centre of the Military Market , although it is uncertain which stars depicted what . Schlegel reported that the stars Omicron and Pi Canis Majoris might have been them , while Beta or Nu2 have also been proposed . Sirius was <unk> ( <unk> ) , the Celestial Wolf , denoting invasion and plunder . Southeast of the Wolf was the asterism <unk> ( <unk> ) , the celestial Bow and Arrow , which was interpreted as containing Delta , Epsilon , Eta and Kappa Canis Majoris and Delta Velorum . Alternatively , the arrow was depicted by Omicron2 and Eta and aiming at Sirius ( the Wolf ) , while the bow comprised Kappa , Epsilon , Sigma , Delta and 164 Canis Majoris , and Pi and Omicron Puppis . 
 Both the Māori people and the people of the Tuamotus recognized the figure of Canis Major as a distinct entity , though it was sometimes absorbed into other constellations . Te <unk> @-@ o @-@ Rehua , also called Te <unk> @-@ nui @-@ o @-@ Rehua and Te Kahui @-@ Takurua , ( " The Assembly of Rehua " or " The Assembly of Sirius " ) was a Maori constellation that included both Canis Minor and Canis Major , along with some surrounding stars . Related was <unk> @-@ o @-@ Rehua , also called <unk> , the Mirror of Rehua , formed from an undefined group of stars in Canis Major . They called Sirius Rehua and <unk> , corresponding to two of the names for the constellation , though Rehua was a name applied to other stars in various Maori groups and other Polynesian cosmologies . The Tuamotu people called Canis Major <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ o @-@ Takurua , " the abiding assemblage of Takurua " . 
 The <unk> people of the Shoalhaven River saw three stars of Canis Major as <unk> ( Bat ) and his two wives <unk> ( Mrs Brown Snake ) and <unk> ( Mrs Black Snake ) ; bored of following their husband around , the women try to bury him while he is hunting a wombat down its hole . He spears them and all three are placed in the sky as the constellation <unk> . To the Boorong people of Victoria , Sigma Canis Majoris was Unurgunite , and its flanking stars Delta and Epsilon were his two wives . The moon ( <unk> , " native cat " ) sought to lure the further wife ( Epsilon ) away , but Unurgunite assaulted him and he has been wandering the sky ever since .

 Canis Major is a constellation in the Southern Hemisphere 's summer ( or northern hemisphere 's winter ) sky , bordered by Monoceros ( which lies between it and Canis Minor ) to the north , Puppis to the east and southeast , Columba to the southwest , and Lepus to the west . The three @-@ letter abbreviation for the constellation , as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922 , is ' <unk> ' . The official constellation boundaries , as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930 , are defined by a quadrilateral ; in the equatorial coordinate system , the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between <unk> 12.5m and <unk> <unk> , while the declination coordinates are between − 11 @.@ 03 ° and − 33 @.@ 25 ° .

 Canis Major is a prominent constellation because of its many bright stars . These include Sirius ( Alpha Canis Majoris ) , the brightest star in the night sky , as well as three other stars above magnitude 2 @.@ 0 . Furthermore , two other stars are thought to have previously outshone all others in the night sky — Adhara ( Epsilon Canis Majoris ) shone at <unk> around 4 @.@ 7 million years ago , and Mirzam ( Beta Canis Majoris ) peaked at − 3 @.@ 65 around 4 @.@ 42 million years ago . Another , NR Canis Majoris , will be brightest at magnitude − 0 @.@ 88 in about 2 @.@ 87 million years ' time . 
 The German cartographer Johann Bayer used the Greek letters Alpha through Omicron to label the most prominent stars in the constellation , including three adjacent stars as Nu and two further pairs as Xi and Omicron , while subsequent observers designated further stars in the southern parts of the constellation that were hard to discern from Central Europe . Bayer 's countryman Johann Elert Bode later added Sigma , Tau and Omega ; the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille added lettered stars a to k ( though none are in use today ) . John Flamsteed numbered 31 stars , with 3 Canis Majoris being placed by Lacaille into Columba as Delta Columbae ( Flamsteed had not recognised Columba as a distinct constellation ) . He also labelled two stars — his 10 and 13 Canis Majoris — as <unk> and Kappa2 respectively , but subsequent cartographers such as Francis Baily and John Bevis dropped the fainter former star , leaving Kappa2 as the sole Kappa . Flamsteed 's listing of Nu1 , Nu2 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Omicron1 and Omicron2 have all remained in use . 
 Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky at apparent magnitude − 1 @.@ 46 and one of the closest stars to Earth at a distance of 8 @.@ 6 light @-@ years . Its name comes from the Greek word for " scorching " or " searing " . Sirius is also a binary star ; its companion Sirius B is a white dwarf with a magnitude of 8 @.@ 4 — 10 @,@ 000 times fainter than Sirius A to observers on Earth . The two orbit each other every 50 years . Their closest approach last occurred in 1993 and they will be at their greatest separation between 2020 and 2025 . Sirius was the basis for the ancient Egyptian calendar . The star marked the Great Dog 's mouth on Bayer 's star atlas . 
 Flanking Sirius are Beta and Gamma Canis Majoris . Also called Mirzam or <unk> , Beta is a blue @-@ white Beta Cephei variable star of magnitude 2 @.@ 0 , which varies by a few hundredths of a magnitude over a period of six hours . Mirzam is 500 light @-@ years from Earth , and its traditional name means " the announcer " , referring to its position as the " announcer " of Sirius , as it rises a few minutes before Sirius does . Gamma , also known as <unk> , is a fainter star of magnitude 4 @.@ 12 , in reality a blue @-@ white bright giant of spectral type <unk> located 441 light @-@ years from earth . Iota Canis Majoris , lying between Sirius and Gamma , is another star that has been classified as a Beta Cephei variable , varying from magnitude 4 @.@ 36 to 4 @.@ 40 over a period of 1 @.@ 92 hours . It is a remote blue @-@ white supergiant star of spectral type <unk> , around 46 @,@ 000 times as luminous as the sun and , at 2500 light @-@ years distant , 300 times further away than Sirius . 
 Epsilon , Omicron2 , Delta and Eta Canis Majoris were called Al <unk> " the virgins " in medieval Arabic tradition . Marking the dog 's right thigh on Bayer 's atlas is Epsilon Canis Majoris , also known as Adhara . At magnitude 1 @.@ 5 , it is the second @-@ brightest star in Canis Major and the 23rd @-@ brightest star in the sky . It is a blue @-@ white supergiant of spectral type <unk> , around 404 light @-@ years from Earth . This star is one of the brightest known extreme ultraviolet sources in the sky . It is a binary star ; the secondary is of magnitude 7 @.@ 4 . Its traditional name means " the virgins " , having been transferred from the group of stars to Epsilon alone . Nearby is Delta Canis Majoris , also called Wezen . It is a yellow @-@ white supergiant of spectral type <unk> and magnitude 1 @.@ 84 , around 1605 light @-@ years from Earth . With a traditional name meaning " the weight " , Wezen is 17 times as massive and 50 @,@ 000 times as luminous as the Sun . If located in the centre of the Solar System , it would extend out to Earth as its diameter is 200 times that of the Sun . Only around 10 million years old , Wezen has stopped fusing hydrogen in its core . Its outer envelope is beginning to expand and cool , and in the next 100 @,@ 000 years it will become a red supergiant as its core fuses heavier and heavier elements . Once it has a core of iron , it will collapse and explode as a supernova . Nestled between Adhara and Wezen lies Sigma Canis Majoris , known as Unurgunite to the Boorong and <unk> people , a red supergiant of spectral type <unk> that varies irregularly between magnitudes 3 @.@ 43 and 3 @.@ 51 . 
 Also called Aludra , Eta Canis Majoris is a blue @-@ white supergiant of spectral type <unk> with a luminosity 176 @,@ 000 times and diameter around 80 times that of the Sun . Classified as an Alpha Cygni type variable star , Aludra varies in brightness from magnitude 2 @.@ 38 to 2 @.@ 48 over a period of 4 @.@ 7 days . It is located 1120 light @-@ years away . To the west of Adhara lies 3 @.@ 0 @-@ magnitude Zeta Canis Majoris or <unk> , around 362 light @-@ years distant from Earth . It is a spectroscopic binary , whose components orbit each other every 1 @.@ 85 years , the combined spectrum indicating a main star of spectral type <unk> 
 Between these stars and Sirius lie Omicron1 , Omicron2 , and Pi Canis Majoris . Omicron2 is a massive supergiant star about 21 times as massive as the Sun . Only 7 million years old , it has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and is now processing helium . It has an Alpha Cygni variable that undergoes periodic non @-@ radial pulsations , which cause its brightness to cycle from magnitude 2 @.@ 93 to 3 @.@ 08 over a 24 @.@ 44 @-@ day interval . Omicron1 is an orange K @-@ type supergiant of spectral type <unk> that is an irregular variable star , varying between apparent magnitudes 3 @.@ 78 and 3 @.@ 99 . Around 18 times as massive as the Sun , it shines with 65 @,@ 000 times its luminosity . 
 North of Sirius lie Theta and Mu Canis Majoris , Theta being the most northerly star with a Bayer designation in the constellation . Around 8 billion years old , it is an orange giant of spectral type K4III that is around as massive as the Sun but has expanded to 30 times the Sun 's diameter . Mu is a multiple star system located around 1244 light @-@ years distant , its components discernible in a small telescope as a 5 @.@ 3 @-@ magnitude yellow @-@ hued and 7 @.@ 1 @-@ magnitude bluish star . The brighter star is a giant of spectral type K2III , while the companion is a main sequence star of spectral type <unk> Nu Canis Majoris is a yellow @-@ hued giant star of magnitude 5 @.@ 7 , 278 light @-@ years away ; it is at the threshold of naked @-@ eye visibility . It has a companion of magnitude 8 @.@ 1 . 
 At the southern limits of the constellation lie Kappa and Lambda Canis Majoris . Although of similar spectra and nearby each other as viewed from Earth , they are unrelated .

 Canis Major is also home to many variable stars . EZ Canis Majoris is a Wolf – Rayet star of spectral type <unk> that varies between magnitudes 6 @.@ 71 and 6 @.@ 95 over a period of 3 @.@ 766 days ; the cause of its variability is unknown but thought to be related to its stellar wind and rotation . VY Canis Majoris is one of the largest stars known , a remote red supergiant located around 3800 light @-@ years away from Earth . Estimates of its size , mass and luminosity have varied , with figures of 600 to 3000 times the radius , and 60 @,@ 000 to 500 @,@ 000 times the luminosity of the Sun . It was observed in 2011 using interferometry with the Very Large Telescope , yielding a radius of 1420 ± 120 solar radii , surface temperature of around <unk> K ( and hence spectral type <unk> ) and a luminosity 270 @,@ 000 times that of the Sun . Its current mass has been revised at 9 – 25 solar masses , having shed material from an initial 15 – 35 solar masses . W Canis Majoris is a type of red giant known as a carbon star — a semiregular variable , it ranges between magnitudes 6 @.@ 27 and 7 @.@ 09 over a period of 160 days . A cool star , it has a surface temperature of around 2900 K and a radius 234 times that of the Sun , its distance estimated at 1444 – 1450 light @-@ years from Earth . At the other extreme in size is RX <unk> @-@ 3125 , a neutron star with a radius of around 5 km . Exceedingly faint , it has an apparent magnitude of 26 @.@ 6 . Its spectrum and temperature appear to be mysteriously changing over several years . The nature of the changes are unclear , but it is possible they were caused by an event such as the star 's absorption of an accretion disc . 
 Tau Canis Majoris is a Beta Lyrae @-@ type eclipsing multiple star system that varies from magnitude 4 @.@ 32 to 4 @.@ 37 over 1 @.@ 28 days . Its four main component stars are hot O @-@ type stars , with a combined mass 80 times that of the Sun and shining with 500 @,@ 000 times its luminosity , but little is known of their individual properties . A fifth component , a magnitude 10 star , lies at a distance of 13 @,@ 000 astronomical units ( 0 @.@ 21 ly ) . The system is only 5 million years old . UW Canis Majoris is another Beta Lyrae @-@ type star 3000 light @-@ years from Earth ; it is an eclipsing binary that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 5 @.@ 3 to a maximum of 4 @.@ 8 . It has a period of 4 @.@ 4 days ; its components are two massive hot blue stars , one a blue supergiant of spectral type <unk> @-@ 8 Iab , while its companion is a slightly cooler , less evolved and less luminous supergiant of spectral type <unk> The stars are 200 @,@ 000 and 63 @,@ 000 times as luminous as the Sun . However the fainter star is the more massive at 19 solar masses to the primary 's 16 . R Canis Majoris is another eclipsing binary that varies from magnitude 5 @.@ 7 to 6 @.@ 34 over 1 @.@ 13 days , with a third star orbiting these two every 93 years . The shortness of the orbital period and the low ratio between the two main components make this an unusual Algol @-@ type system . 
 Seven star systems have been found to have planets . Nu2 Canis Majoris is an ageing orange giant of spectral type K1III of apparent magnitude 3 @.@ 91 located around 64 light @-@ years distant . Around 1 @.@ 5 times as massive and 11 times as luminous as the Sun , it is orbited over a period of 763 days by a planet 2 @.@ 6 times as massive as Jupiter . HD <unk> is likewise an ageing orange giant found to have a planetary system — echoing the fate of the Solar System in a few billion years as the Sun ages and becomes a giant . Conversely , HD <unk> is a star 107 light @-@ years distant that is a little smaller and cooler than the Sun , of spectral type G8V , which has two planets discovered in 2008 . With orbital periods of 228 and 342 days , the planets have a 3 : 2 orbital resonance , which helps stabilise the system . HD 47186 is another sunlike star with two planets ; the inner — HD 47186 b — takes four days to complete an orbit and has been classified as a Hot Neptune , while the outer — HD 47186 c — has an eccentric 3 @.@ 7 @-@ year period orbit and has a similar mass to Saturn . HD <unk> is a sunlike star around 183 light @-@ years distant that has a Jupiter @-@ size planet with an eccentric orbit . 
 Z Canis Majoris is a star system a mere 300 @,@ 000 years old composed of two pre @-@ main @-@ sequence stars — a FU Orionis star and a Herbig Ae / Be star , which has brightened episodically by two magnitudes to magnitude 8 in 1987 , 2000 , 2004 and 2008 . The more massive Herbig Ae / Be star is enveloped in an irregular roughly spherical cocoon of dust that has an inner diameter of 20 AU ( 3 @.@ 0 × 109 km ) and outer diameter of 50 AU ( 7 @.@ 5 × 109 km ) . The cocoon has a hole in it through which light shines that covers an angle of 5 to 10 degrees of its circumference . Both stars are surrounded by a large envelope of in @-@ falling material left over from the original cloud that formed the system . Both stars are emitting jets of material , that of the Herbig Ae / Be star being much larger — 11 @.@ 7 light @-@ years long . Meanwhile , FS Canis Majoris is another star with infra @-@ red emissions indicating a compact shell of dust , but it appears to be a main @-@ sequence star that has absorbed material from a companion . These stars are thought to be significant contributors to interstellar dust .

 The band of the Milky Way goes through Canis Major , with only patchy <unk> by interstellar dust clouds . It is bright in the northeastern corner of the constellation , as well as in a triangular area between Adhara , Wezen and Aludra , with many stars visible in binoculars . Canis Major boasts several open clusters . The only Messier object is M41 ( NGC 2287 ) , an open cluster with a combined visual magnitude of 4 @.@ 5 , around 2300 light @-@ years from Earth . Located 4 degrees south of Sirius , it contains contrasting blue , yellow and orange stars and covers an area the apparent size of the full moon — in reality around 25 light @-@ years in diameter . Its most luminous stars have already evolved into giants . The brightest is a 6 @.@ 3 @-@ magnitude star of spectral type K3 . Located in the field is 12 Canis Majoris , though this star is only 670 light @-@ years distant . NGC 2360 , known as Caroline 's Cluster after its discoverer Caroline Herschel , is an open cluster located 3 @.@ 5 degrees west of <unk> and has a combined apparent magnitude of 7 @.@ 2 . Around 15 light @-@ years in diameter , it is located 3700 light @-@ years away from Earth , and has been dated to around 2 @.@ 2 billion years old . NGC 2362 is a small , compact open cluster , 5200 light @-@ years from Earth . It contains about 60 stars , of which Tau Canis Majoris is the brightest member . Located around 3 degrees northeast of Wezen , it covers an area around 12 light @-@ years in diameter , though the stars appear huddled around Tau when seen through binoculars . It is a very young open cluster as its member stars are only a few million years old . Lying 2 degrees southwest of NGC 2362 is NGC 2354 a fainter open cluster of magnitude 6 @.@ 5 , with around 15 member stars visible with binoculars . Located around 30 ' northeast of NGC 2360 , NGC <unk> ( Thor 's Helmet or the Duck Nebula ) is a relatively bright emission nebula in Canis Major , with an approximate magnitude of 10 , which is 10 @,@ 000 light @-@ years from Earth . The nebula is shaped by HD <unk> , an unstable Wolf @-@ Rayet star embedded within it . 
 In 2003 , an overdensity of stars in the region was announced to be the Canis Major Dwarf , the closest satellite galaxy to Earth . However , there remains debate over whether it represents a disrupted dwarf galaxy or in fact a variation in the thin and thick disk and spiral arm populations of the Milky Way . Investigation of the area yielded only ten RR Lyrae variables — consistent with the Milky Way 's halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy . On the other hand , a globular cluster in Puppis , NGC 2298 — which appears to be part of the Canis Major dwarf system — is extremely metal @-@ poor , suggesting it did not arise from the Milky Way 's thick disk , and instead is of extragalactic origin . 
 NGC 2207 and IC 2163 are a pair of face @-@ on interacting spiral galaxies located 125 million light @-@ years from Earth . About 40 million years ago , the two galaxies had a close encounter and are now moving farther apart ; nevertheless , the smaller IC 2163 will eventually be incorporated into NGC 2207 . As the interaction continues , gas and dust will be perturbed , sparking extensive star formation in both galaxies . Supernovae have been observed in NGC 2207 in 1975 ( type Ia SN <unk> ) , 1999 ( the type Ib SN <unk> ) , 2003 ( type 1b supernova SN <unk> ) , and 2013 ( type II supernova SN <unk> ) . Located 16 million light @-@ years distant , ESO 489 @-@ 056 is an irregular <unk> and low @-@ surface @-@ brightness galaxy that has one of the lowest metallicities known . 
 = Chard , Somerset = 
 Chard is a town and a civil parish in the English county of Somerset . It lies on the A30 road near the Devon border , 15 miles ( 24 km ) south west of Yeovil . The parish has a population of approximately 13 @,@ 000 and , at an elevation of 121 metres ( 397 ft ) , Chard is the southernmost and highest town in Somerset . Administratively Chard forms part of the district of South Somerset . 
 The name of the town was <unk> in 1065 and <unk> in the Domesday Book of 1086 . Before the Norman Conquest , Chard was held by the Bishop of Wells . The town 's first charter was from King John in 1234 . Most of the town was destroyed by fire in 1577 , and it was further damaged during the English Civil War . A 1663 will by Richard Harvey of Exeter established Almshouses known as Harvey 's Hospital . In 1685 Chard was one of the towns in which Judge Jeffreys held some of the Bloody Assizes after the failure of the Monmouth Rebellion . 
 Textile manufacture was important to the town during the Middle Ages . Chard is the birthplace of powered flight as in 1848 John Stringfellow first demonstrated that engine @-@ powered flight was possible . Percy and <unk> Petter , who formed Westland Aircraft Works , witnessed some of Stringfellow 's demonstrations in Chard and often asked for help in the formation of Westland 's first aircraft development factory on the outskirts of Yeovil . AgustaWestland now holds the Henson and Stringfellow lecture yearly for the <unk> . James Gillingham developed articulated artificial limbs . Chard is a key point on the Taunton Stop Line , a World War II defensive line . 
 The Chard Canal was a tub boat canal built between 1835 and 1842 . Chard Branch Line was created in 1860 to connect the two London and South Western Railway and Bristol and Exeter Railway main lines and ran through Chard until 1965 . 
 Local folklore relates that the town has a very unusual and unique feature : a stream running along either side of Fore Street . One stream eventually flows into the Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel . Chard Reservoir , approximately a mile north east of the town , is a Local Nature Reserve , and Snowdon Hill Quarry a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest . Major employers in the town include <unk> International Limited and the Oscar Mayer food processing plant . There are a range of sporting and cultural facilities , with secondary education being provided at Holyrood Academy ; religious sites including the Church of St Mary the Virgin which dates from the late 11th century . 
 = = History = = 
 Chard 's name was <unk> in 1065 and <unk> in the Domesday Book of 1086 and it means " house on the chart or rough ground " ( Old English : <unk> + <unk> ) . Before the Norman Conquest Chard was held by the Bishop of Wells . The town 's first charter was from King John and another from the bishop in 1234 , which delimited the town and laid out burgage holdings in 1 @-@ acre ( 4 @,@ 000 m2 ) lots at a rent of twelve pence per year . The parish of Chard was part of the Kingsbury Hundred , 
 Most of the town was destroyed by fire in 1577 . After this time the town was largely rebuilt including Waterloo House and Manor Court House in Fore Street which were built as a house and courtroom , and have now been converted into shops and offices . Further damage to the town took place during the English Civil War with both sides plundering its resources , particularly in 1644 when Charles I spent a week in the town . 
 A 1663 will by Richard Harvey of Exeter established Almshouses which became Harvey 's Hospital . These were rebuilt in 1870 largely of stone from previous building . In 1685 Chard was one of the towns in which Judge Jeffreys held some of the Bloody Assizes after the failure of the Monmouth Rebellion in which 160 men from Chard joined the forces of the Duke of Monmouth . The subsequent hangings took place on Snowden Hill to the west of the town . As elsewhere in this area , the ' finger @-@ post ' road @-@ sign at this spot is painted red and is known as ' Red Post ' to commemorate the executions . 
 There was a fulling mill in the town by 1394 for the textile industry . After 1820 this expanded with the town becoming a centre for lace manufacture led by manufacturers who fled from the Luddite resistance they had faced in the English Midlands . Bowden 's Old Lace Factory and the Gifford Fox factory are examples of the sites constructed . The Guildhall was built as a Corn Exchange and Guildhall in 1834 and is now the Town Hall . 
 On Snowdon Hill is a small cottage which was originally a toll house built by the Chard Turnpike trust in the 1830s , to collect fees from those using a road up the hill which avoided the steep gradient . 
 Chard claims to be the birthplace of powered flight , as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian aeronautical pioneer John Stringfellow ( 1799 – 1883 ) first demonstrated that engine @-@ powered flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage . James Gillingham ( 1839 – 1924 ) from Chard pioneered the development of articulated artificial limbs when he produced a prosthesis for a man who lost his arm in a cannon accident in 1863 . Chard Museum has a display of Gillingham 's work . 
 Chard was a key point on the Taunton Stop Line , a World War II defensive line consisting of pillboxes and anti @-@ tank obstacles , which runs from Axminster north to the Somerset coast near Highbridge . In 1938 a bomb proof bunker was built behind the branch of the Westminster Bank . During the war it was used to hold duplicate copies of the bank records in case its headquarters in London was destroyed . It was also used to store the emergency bank note supply of the Bank of England . There has also been speculation that the Crown Jewels were also stored there , however this has never been confirmed . 
 Action Aid , the International Development Charity , had their headquarters in Chard when they started life in 1972 as Action in Distress . The Supporters Services department of the charity is still based in Chard .

 Chard was one of the boroughs reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 , and remained a municipal borough known as Chard Municipal <unk> until the Local Government Act 1972 , when it became a successor parish in the Non @-@ metropolitan district of South Somerset . 
 The town council ( a parish council with the status of a town ) has responsibility for local issues , including setting an annual precept ( local rate ) to cover the council 's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny . The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police , district council officers , and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime , security , and traffic ; their role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities , as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance , repair , and improvement of highways , drainage , footpaths , public transport , and street cleaning . Conservation matters ( including trees and listed buildings ) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council . The town council has a reception and offices in the guildhall . The building was built in 1834 as a corn exchange , replacing an earlier 16th @-@ century building that used to be situated perpendicular to where the current road is in the high street outside the Phoenix Hotel , a dig of the high street back in the late 1980s revealed the original footprint of the old guildhall . The new re @-@ modeled Guildhall is a Grade II * listed building . 
 In 2006 Chard Town Council came to the attention of the National Press when Mayor Tony Prior was found guilty of sexual discrimination and victimisation of the Town Clerk . He was ordered to pay £ 33 @,@ 000 in compensation and banned from holding public office for nine months . 
 The South Somerset district council is responsible for local planning and building control , local roads , council housing , environmental health , markets and fairs , refuse collection and recycling , cemeteries and crematoria , leisure services , parks , and tourism . Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education , social services , the library , roads , public transport , trading standards , waste disposal and strategic planning , although fire , police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service , Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service . 
 The civil parish of Chard Town ( its formal name ) contains exactly five electoral wards — <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Holyrood , and Jocelyn . 
 Chard is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . It elects one Member of Parliament ( MP ) by the first past the post system of election , and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects six MEPs using the d 'Hondt method of party @-@ list proportional representation .

 At an altitude of 121 metres ( 397 ft ) , Chard is the highest town in Somerset , and is also the southernmost . The suburbs include : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Henson Park and Old Town . Local folklore claims that the town has a very unusual and unique feature , a stream running along either side of Fore Street . One stream eventually flows into the Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel . This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted into the Isle ; the gutter in Holyrood Street , though , still flows into the River Axe and therefore it is still true it lies on the watershed and that two gutters within the down eventually drain into the Bristol Channel and the English Channel . 
 The 36 @.@ 97 hectares ( 91 @.@ 4 acres ) Chard Reservoir , around a mile northeast of the town , is a Local Nature Reserve . It is used for dog walking , fishing and birdwatching , with a bird hide having been installed . Species which are spotted regularly include herons , kingfishers , cormorants , grebes , ducks and also a wide range of woodland songbirds . Others include the great white egret , cattle egret , and spotted redshank . 
 Snowdon Hill Quarry is a 0 @.@ 6 hectare ( 1 @.@ 3 acre ) geological Site of Special Scientific Interest on the western outskirts . The site shows rock exposures through the Upper Greensand and Chalk , containing fossil crustaceans which are both unique and exceptionally well @-@ preserved making it a key locality for the study of palaeontology in Britain .

 Along with the rest of South West England , Chard has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country . The annual mean temperature is approximately 10 ° C ( 50 @.@ 0 ° F ) . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures . The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately 21 ° C ( 69 @.@ 8 ° F ) . In winter mean minimum temperatures of 1 ° C ( 33 @.@ 8 ° F ) or 2 ° C ( 35 @.@ 6 ° F ) are common . In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south @-@ west of England , however convective cloud sometimes forms inland , reducing the number of hours of sunshine . Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1 @,@ 600 hours . In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton . Most the rainfall in the south @-@ west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection . Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions , which is when they are most active . In summer , a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms . Average rainfall is around 700 mm ( 28 in ) . About 8 – 15 days of snowfall is typical . November to March have the highest mean wind speeds , and June to August have the lightest winds . The predominant wind direction is from the south @-@ west .

 One of the other large employers in Chard is Oscar Mayer , which is not to be confused with the American company of the same name owned by Kraft Foods . In 2007 , it was announced that the factory would be bought by Icelandic company , the <unk> Group which owns Lyons seafoods . However this deal fell through and the company announced 250 job losses . Oscar Mayer has historically employed many Portuguese and , more recently , Polish workers . 
 Chard is also home to Brecknell Willis & Co . Ltd . , one of the world 's oldest and leading specialists in the design , construction , and installation of railway electrification systems , most notably metro and light rail systems . Its largest customer , London Underground , purchases both train born equipment and infrastructure . Brecknell Willis occupies a site at the bottom of the hill , next to the site of the old LSWR station , which is now a Tesco store . At the time of writing ( August 2014 ) the company was preparing to move into a new purpose @-@ built building from which all of its operations will be based .

 From 1842 Chard was the terminus of the Chard Canal , a tub boat canal that joined the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal at Creech St. Michael . It had four aqueducts , three tunnels and four inclined planes along its 13 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 21 @.@ 7 km ) length . It took seven years to construct and cost about £ 140 @,@ 000 ( £ 11 @.@ 9 million in 2015 ) . 
 In the 1860s the town became the terminus of two railway lines . The first was opened in 1863 by the London and South Western Railway ( LSWR ) as a short branch line from their main line . This approached the town from the south . The second and longer line was opened by the Bristol and Exeter Railway ( B & ER ) in 1866 and ran northwards , close to the route of the canal , to join their main line near Taunton . From 1917 they were both operated by one company , but services were mostly advertised as though it was still two separate lines . It was closed to passengers in 1962 and freight traffic was withdrawn a few years later . 
 The LSWR 's station ( later known as Chard Town ) opened in 1860 with a single platform , and the B & ER 's ( variously known as Chard Joint or Chard Central ) in 1866 . For five years LSWR trains continued to call at Chard Town and then reversed to the connecting line and then resumed their forward journey to the Joint station . In 1871 a new platform was opened on the connecting line ; this closed to passengers on 1 January 1917 but the town station was the main goods depot for the town until it finally closed on 18 April 1966 . Passenger trains ceased to operate to Chard Central on 11 September 1962 , and private goods traffic on 3 October 1966 . The station building and train shed still stand and are in use by engineering companies . 
 The town 's public transport links to Taunton are now provided by First Somerset & Avon ( bus route 30 ) and Stagecoach Southwest ( bus route 99 ) , which both run hourly during weekdays .

 The President Casino Broadwater Resort was a combined casino and resort that was located in Biloxi , Mississippi . It was a fixture on the Mississippi Gulf Coast for over 60 years . 
 Originally known as the Broadwater Beach Hotel and Broadwater Beach Resort , it opened in 1939 as a venue for the illegal but tacitly approved gambling that was flourishing along the coast . In the late 1950s and 1960s , the gambling stopped and the facility was renovated and re @-@ purposed as a resort destination with a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art marina and other amenities .

 The Broadwater Beach Hotel was built in 1938 by investors seeking to gain the business of gamblers coming to casinos along the Mississippi Gulf Coast . It opened in 1939 , and was built in Art Deco style . The first owner was Pete Martin Sr. , a well @-@ known gambler and rum runner along the coast . He openly ran a casino within the hotel , as even though it was nominally illegal at the time , gambling was part of the social and economic fabric of Biloxi . After Martin died , openly illegal gambling was frowned upon , and new owners tried to appeal to just the tourist market . In 1958 , it was bought by Joe Brown , a Texas oil millionaire . 
 Following his death in 1959 , his widow Dorothy Brown , who was a noted New Orleans philanthropist , renovated the property for a more modern look , including a wide arched canopy in the front . In the early 1960s , the Mississippi Gulf Coast was emerging as a prime alternative to Florida as a southern vacation destination , and the Broadwater Beach Resort was considered the pacesetter for the area . In 1963 , Dorothy Brown spent $ 3 million to build a marina and a heliport . The Broadwater Resort Marina plan was especially ambitious , involving hosting up to 150 sail and powerboats , and offering shore @-@ to @-@ ship maid service and room service to those docked , all in an effort to capture blue @-@ water game fishing business . When the marina opened in 1965 , it was considered state of the art . In 1968 , she built the Broadwater Beach Sun Course on land originally owned by Jefferson Davis , and thus added golf as a prime attraction for visitors ; by 1974 a Sea Course was also present . During the 1960s , a men 's store was present in the hotel . For entertainment , the hotel featured musicians from New Orleans and elsewhere . From the 1950s on , operational control of the hotel and resort rested with Leigh <unk> , one of the few women to rise to the top of the local hotel industry in that era . In the 1960s the Broadwater Beach Resort found its glory years . Hosting movie stars , leading politicians , and top business figures , as well as people on vacation , it became the Gulf Coast 's flagship resort . During this decade , the iconic and colorfully lit Broadwater Beach Resort front sign was added . 
 Hurricane Camille devastated the Mississippi Gulf Coast in August 1969 . The resort golf club pro and his wife fought for their lives as the storm wrecked their pro shop apartment . The hotel 's first floor was carved out by the storm surge , expensive furniture floated out of the lobby , and the marina suffered moderate damage . But the resort rebounded and by 1977 it was described as a " bustling colony of rooms , cottages , restaurants , golf courses , tennis courts , and its own marina . " Conferences were held there , and the Broadwater Beach Hotel was the setting for a fictional regional sales meeting in the 1982 Frederick Barthelme short story " Box Step " . 
 = = Casino era = = 
 Entrepreneur John E. Connelly , founder of President Casinos , then gained control of the property , and the President Casino Broadwater Resort was opened aboard a riverboat docked at the Broadwater Resort Marina in August 1992 . It was the second casino to open on the Mississippi Gulf Coast , following the Isle of Capri Casino which opened two weeks earlier . In June 1995 , President Casinos replaced the riverboat with the former Mississippi Gold Shore Casino barge . The table games there were known for having lower limits than most other Biloxi casinos . Major country music stars performed there on Wednesday through Saturday nights , and the hotel had 550 rooms available across two structures . In 1997 and 1999 , titles to the resort property and barge were formally transferred from Connelly to President Casinos . 
 By the early 2000s , the President Casino Broadwater Resort sat on 260 acres ( 1 @.@ 1 km2 ) . The powerboat @-@ oriented Broadwater Resort Marina had 118 berths , and was regarded as " one of the best full @-@ service , luxurious marinas between Mobile and New Orleans . " The President Broadwater Golf Club offered a full @-@ length 18 @-@ hole course . The casino featured over 38 @,@ 000 square feet ( 3 @,@ 500 m2 ) of gambling with over 900 slot machines . However , no work had been done on the old resort and its hotel , resulting in its declining in appearance to a run @-@ down state . The hotel capacity was down to 450 rooms and suites , and functioned mainly as a place for the casino barge customers to sleep briefly ; furniture was piled up in corridors , the hotel main floor entertainment rooms were empty , and weeds grew on the resort 's tennis courts . Nevertheless , the resort still made reference to its pre @-@ casino past , calling itself " one of the last great Southern resorts on the Mississippi Gulf Coast . " 
 The casino itself found a niche market among local gamblers and was a reliable earner . President Casinos was saddled with corporate debt , however , and a planned new $ 2 billion resort at the site , to be called Destination Broadwater , never materialized . In April 2001 , the President Broadwater Hotel , which represented the non @-@ casino operations , filed for bankruptcy . President Casinos filed for bankruptcy in June 2002 , and the Broadwater casino the following month , but operation of the President Casino Broadwater Resort continued . 
 = = End = = 
 In January 2005 , Broadwater Development LLC – a casino holding company owned by two local construction figures , Roy Anderson III and Cotton Fore – won a bankruptcy auction bid for the casino and resort for $ 82 million , amid speculation that they had overpaid . Anderson said of the barge , " It 's a nice structure . But overall aesthetically , it 's not going to fit into our master plan . " On April 15 , 2005 , the deal closed ; as part of it , the President Casino barge was purchased for $ 6 @.@ 8 million by Silver Slipper Casino Venture LLC with the intention of operating it under the name of President Casino until it could be moved to their site in Hancock County , Mississippi , where the Silver Slipper operators thought it would fit in . On July 31 , 2005 , the Broadwater Beach Resort closed its doors , with Broadwater Development announcing plans to tear it down and build a new resort and casino . 
 Less than a month later , on August 29 , 2005 , Hurricane Katrina tore the casino barge from its moorings and washed it ashore ½ mile west of the Broadwater Resort Marina . The barge was a total loss , it was cut up as scrap and removed by a salvage company . ( The new Silver Slipper Casino would be built from the ground up instead and open in late 2006 . ) The hotel in the resort part was still standing but heavily damaged by Katrina , with the storm surge reaching the second floor . The famed sign was destroyed . The marina too was wrecked and closed . The golf course did not reopen . The hotel subsequently underwent demolition , which concluded by November 2006 with even the foundation slabs removed . 
 Once the post @-@ Katrina building boom began , the Broadwater site increased in value and several other casino operations indicated an interest in it . In March 2006 , Broadwater Development LLC gained city approval for creating The Broadwater resort , a $ 1 billion plan that would feature two casinos , 3 @,@ 375 condo units , 1 @,@ 900 hotel rooms , an 18 @-@ hole golf course , large amounts of retail entertainment space and convention space , and a marina again . By September 2007 , the Broadwater developers said they were close to signing with an international entertainment corporation to begin the work , and the Biloxi Planning Commission granted them an 18 @-@ month extension . But by October 2008 , the global financial crisis had prevented anything from happening , and the Mississippi Gaming Commission gave an indefinite extension to the Broadwater site approval . 
 = Normandie @-@ class battleship = 
 The Normandie class of dreadnought battleships was a group of five ships ordered for the French Navy in 1912 – 1913 . The class comprised Normandie , the lead ship , Flandre , Gascogne , Languedoc , and Béarn . The design incorporated a radical arrangement for the twelve 340 mm main battery guns : three quadruple gun turrets , as opposed to the twin turrets used by most other navies . The first four ships were also equipped with an unusual hybrid propulsion system that used both steam turbine and triple expansion engines to increase fuel efficiency . 
 The ships , named after provinces of France , were never completed due to shifting production requirements after the outbreak of war in 1914 . The first four ships were sufficiently advanced in construction to permit their launching to clear the shipyards for other , more important work . Many of the guns built for the ships were instead converted for use by the Army . After the war , the French Navy considered several proposals to complete the ships , either as originally designed or modernized to account for lessons from the war . The weak French post @-@ war economy , however , necessitated that the first four ships be broken up for scrap . The last ship , which was not significantly advanced at the time work halted , was converted into an aircraft carrier in the 1920s . She remained in service in various capacities until the 1960s . The ship was ultimately scrapped in 1967 . 
 = = Development = = 
 In December 1911 , the French Navy 's Technical Committee issued a report that examined the design of the Bretagne class that had been ordered for 1912 . They concluded that the amidships gun turret was an unsatisfactory choice , based on previous experiences with blast damage on battleships from the 1880s . This position influenced the construction of the next class of dreadnought battleships , for which design work began shortly thereafter . The French Navy 's design staff submitted the first draft of the new dreadnought design in February 1912 . The size of French shipyard facilities significantly impacted the design . Length was limited to 172 meters ( 564 ft ) , breadth to 27 @.@ 8 m ( 91 ft 2 in ) , and draft to approximately 8 @.@ 8 m ( 29 ft ) . These dimensions limited the ship to a displacement of around 25 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 25 @,@ 000 long tons ) and a speed of 20 to 21 knots ( 37 to 39 km / h ; 23 to 24 mph ) , depending on the armament arrangement . The design staff advocated retaining the same armament and armor as the previous Bretagne class , and a top speed of 21 knots . 
 The design staff prepared another version that was armed with a main battery of sixteen 406 mm ( 16 @.@ 0 in ) guns in four quadruple turrets and had a top speed of 20 knots . The Technical department prepared two different designs for the propulsion system . Four direct drive steam turbines were proposed , as in the Bretagne class ; the other option was a hybrid system that used a pair of direct drive turbines on the inner two propeller shafts , and two reciprocating steam engines on the outer shafts for low @-@ speed cruising . The latter design was adopted for the new ships , as the all @-@ turbine system was less fuel @-@ efficient . The fifth ship , Béarn , however , was instead equipped with four sets of turbines . The armor layout of the Bretagne class was retained , and the full load draft fixed at no greater than 9 m ( 30 ft ) . 
 The next issue to be addressed was the main armament . The General Staff decided in March 1912 to retain the 34 @-@ centimeter ( 13 in ) gun of the Bretagne class . They chose the new quadruple turret and advocated an armament of twelve guns in two quadruple and two double turrets . If this arrangement placed too much weight on the bow and stern , the arrangement of five twin turrets as in the Bretagne @-@ class battleships would be substituted . In April 1912 , the Naval Supreme Council accepted the latter design , unless the quadruple turret could be readied by the time construction was scheduled to begin . The armor layout of the Bretagne class was to be retained , though an increase in the thickness of the main belt was to be effected if possible . 
 The Technical Department prepared two new designs , A7 , which incorporated the five twin turrets , and <unk> , which was armed with three quadruple turrets . The <unk> design was some 500 t ( 490 long tons ; 550 short tons ) lighter than the A7 design , and on 6 April , the Navy accepted a quadruple turret design submitted by Saint @-@ Chamond . The secondary battery was initially to have comprised twenty @-@ two 138 @.@ 6 mm ( 5 @.@ 46 in ) guns , but by subtracting four guns , twelve 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) guns could be added for the same weight . The 100 mm design was not completed by the time work was scheduled to begin , so the 138 @.@ 6 mm gun was chosen . The Technical Department had initially proposed mounting the secondary guns in single and twin turrets , but it was determined that this arrangement was not flexible enough . Instead , they were mounted in casemates in eight groups of three guns .

 The ships were 170 @.@ 6 m ( 559 ft 9 in ) long between perpendiculars , 175 @.@ 6 m ( 576 ft 1 in ) long at the waterline , and 176 @.@ 6 m ( 579 ft 5 in ) long overall . They had a beam of 27 m ( 88 ft 7 in ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 65 m ( 28 ft 5 in ) . At full load , the ships were to displace 25 @,@ 230 t ( 24 @,@ 830 long tons ) . The first four ships were equipped with a pair of steam turbines on the center shafts , without reversing gear . Normandie and Flandre had Parsons turbines , Gascogne had turbines built by Rateau @-@ Bretagne , and Languedoc 's turbines were built by Schneider @-@ Zoelly . The four ships had a pair of four @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines for steaming astern or cruising at low speed . The last ship , Béarn , was equipped with four Parsons turbines . Normandie and Gascogne were given twenty @-@ one Guyot du Temple small tube boilers , Flandre and Languedoc were equipped with twenty @-@ eight Belleville small tube boilers , while Béarn had twenty @-@ one Niclausse small tube boilers . 
 The ships ' engines were rated at 32 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 24 @,@ 000 kW ) and had a top speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) , with plans to increase the power to 45 @,@ 000 shp ( 34 @,@ 000 kW ) and 22 knots ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) . The ships were designed to carry 900 t ( 890 long tons ) of coal and 300 t ( 300 long tons ) of fuel oil , but up to 2 @,@ 700 t ( 2 @,@ 700 long tons ) of coal could be stored in the hull . At a cruising speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) , the ships could steam for 6 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 12 @,@ 000 km ; 7 @,@ 500 mi ) ; at 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) , the range fell to 3 @,@ 375 nmi ( 6 @,@ 250 km ; 3 @,@ 884 mi ) , and at top speed , the cruising radius dropped to 1 @,@ 800 nmi ( 3 @,@ 300 km ; 2 @,@ 100 mi ) . The ships would have had a crew of 43 officers , 120 petty officers , and 1 @,@ 037 enlisted men . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 Twelve 340mm / 45 Modèle 1912 guns mounted in three quadruple turrets comprised the main battery . One turret was placed forward , one amidships , and one aft , all on the centerline . The turrets weighed 1 @,@ 500 t ( 1 @,@ 500 long tons ; 1 @,@ 700 short tons ) , and were electrically trained and hydraulically elevated . The guns were divided into pairs and mounted in twin cradles ; a 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick bulkhead divided the turrets . Each pair of guns had its own ammunition hoist and magazine . They could be fired simultaneously or independently . The guns had a range of 16 @,@ 000 m ( 52 @,@ 000 ft ) and had a rate of fire of two rounds per minute . The shells were 540 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ 190 lb ) armor @-@ piercing rounds and were fired with a muzzle velocity of 800 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ) . Each gun was to have been supplied with 100 rounds of ammunition . Five 3 @.@ 66 m ( 12 @.@ 0 ft ) rangefinders provided fire @-@ control for the main battery . Two of the rangefinders were mounted on the conning tower and the other three were placed atop each of the turrets . The turrets also had secondary gunnery control stations . 
 The ships would also have been armed with a secondary battery of twenty @-@ four 138 @.@ 6 mm / 55 Modèle 1910 guns , each singly mounted in casemates in the hull . These guns fired a 36 @.@ 5 kg ( 80 lb ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 830 m / s ( 2 @,@ 700 ft / s ) . The guns would have been supplied with 275 rounds of ammunition each . Six 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) M1902 anti @-@ aircraft guns , which were converted from low @-@ angle guns , would also have been carried by the ships . The ships were also equipped with six 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes , mounted submerged in the hull . Each ship was to be supplied with 36 torpedoes . 
 The ships ' waterline belt armor was 300 mm ( 12 in ) thick amidships , and reduced to 120 to 180 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 to 7 @.@ 1 in ) at the bow and stern . The upper belt was 240 mm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) thick amidships and 160 mm ( 6 @.@ 3 in ) on the ends . The ships had two armored decks , both 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . Sloped armor 70 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) thick connected the lower deck to the side armor . The conning tower had 300 mm thick sides . Each of the barbettes that supported the main battery turrets were protected with 284 mm ( 11 @.@ 2 in ) of armor ; the turrets had 340 mm ( 13 in ) thick faces and 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) thick sides . The casemate guns were protected by 160 – 180 mm thick armor plating .

 Normandie and Languedoc were ordered on 12 December 1912 , followed by Flandre and Gascogne on 30 July 1913 . Béarn was ordered on 3 December ; the five ships would permit the creation of two four @-@ ship divisions with the three Bretagne @-@ class ships then under construction . Work on the class was suspended at the outbreak of World War I , as all resources were needed for the Army . The government did not immediately mobilize for war , as they expected the conflict to be brief . The first four ships were launched after the start of the war , but only to clear the slipways for other purposes . In July 1915 , the Navy determined that the ships were not a priority , and prohibited further work . Later in July , work on the ships ' armament was suspended , save the guns themselves , which could be converted for use by the Army . Four of the completed 340 mm guns were converted into railway guns for the French Army . Nine of the guns built for Languedoc were also mounted on railway carriages in 1919 , after the end of the war . Several of the 138 @.@ 6 mm guns were also converted for service with the Army . 
 At the time work stopped , Normandie 's hull was 65 percent complete , her engines were 70 percent complete , and her boilers were delivered but were instead installed in new destroyers . The turrets were 40 percent assembled . Languedoc had 49 percent of her hull and 73 percent of her engines constructed ; her boilers were 96 percent complete and only 26 percent of her turrets were built . The hulls of Flandre and Gascogne were 65 and 60 percent complete , respectively , and their engines were 60 and 44 percent assembled . Both of their sets of boilers were used for destroyers . The two ships ' turrets were 51 and 75 percent complete . Work on Béarn had not significantly progressed by the time war broke out : her hull was only 8 – 10 percent complete and her engines were only 25 percent finished . Her boilers were 17 percent assembled , and her turrets were at 20 percent . 
 In January 1918 , a final wartime order specified that the ships remained suspended , but that all material that had been stockpiled for work would remain in place . By that time , some 3 @,@ 086 t ( 3 @,@ 037 long tons ; 3 @,@ 402 short tons ) of steel plating that had been earmarked for Gascogne had been taken for other uses . On November 22 , 1918 , days after the Armistice with Germany , the design staff sent the General Staff a proposal to complete the first four <unk> to a modified design . The General Staff replied that the ships would need a top speed of 26 to 28 kn ( 48 to 52 km / h ; 30 to 32 mph ) and a more powerful main battery . Since the dockyard facilities had not been enlarged during the war , the size of the ships could not be significantly increased . This allowed for only modest improvements , particularly for the installation of anti @-@ torpedo bulges . In February 1919 , the General Staff decided that the ships would be completed anyway , because new vessels incorporating the lessons of the war could not be completed for at least 6 to 7 years , due to the lengthy design studies such battleships would require . 
 The Technical Department created a revised design that incorporated some improvements . The machinery for the four ships that had been launched during the war would be retained ; increasing their speed to 24 kn ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) required a corresponding increase to 80 @,@ 000 shp ( 60 @,@ 000 kW ) , which could be obtained by building new turbines . The elevation of the main guns was to be increased to 23 – 24 degrees , which would increase the range of the guns to 25 @,@ 000 m ( 82 @,@ 000 ft ) . The need to engage targets at longer ranges was confirmed by the examination of one of the ex @-@ Austrian Tegetthoff @-@ class ships that had been surrendered to France at the end of the war . The main armored deck was to be increased to 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) to increase resistance to plunging fire . The submerged 450 mm torpedo tubes were to be replaced with deck @-@ mounted 550 mm ( 22 in ) tubes , and fire control equipment was to be improved . Equipment for handling a two @-@ seat spotter aircraft was also to be installed . 
 After the war , Admiral Pierre <unk> 'h became Chief of the General Staff , and in July 1919 he argued that the Italian Navy was the country 's primary rival , and that they might resume work on the Francesco Caracciolo @-@ class battleships that had been suspended during the war . He suggested there were three options for the first four ships : complete them as designed , increase the range of their guns and improve their armor , or lengthen their hull and install new engines to increase speed . The Technical Department determined that lengthening the hulls by 15 m ( 49 ft ) could increase speed by as much as 5 kn ( 9 @.@ 3 km / h ; 5 @.@ 8 mph ) . Nevertheless , by 12 September 1919 , he had determined that completing the ships would be too expensive for the fragile French economy . Plans for the four incomplete ships included converting them into cargo ships , fuel tankers , or passenger liners , and using them as floating fuel depots . These plans were abandoned , however . The four ships were formally cancelled in the 1922 construction program , and were laid up in <unk> and cannibalized for parts before being broken up in 1923 – 1926 . Much of the salvaged material was incorporated into completing Béarn and in the cruisers built during the 1922 program . 
 Béarn was launched in April 1920 to clear the slip ; the Navy had not yet decided what to do with the vessel . Plans to complete the battleship included replacement of the coal @-@ fired boilers with eight oil @-@ fired Niclausse boilers and new , more powerful turbines . A new quadruple turret that allowed for greater range was considered , along with twin turrets mounting 400 mm ( 16 in ) guns . In 1922 , the Navy instead decided to complete the ship as an aircraft carrier . Conversion work began in August 1923 , and was completed by May 1927 . The ship was the first carrier of the French Navy . She served in the fleet through World War II , though she was used as a ferry for aircraft . In 1944 , she was refitted in the United States and equipped with a battery of modern American anti @-@ aircraft guns . She remained in service through the First Indochina War , still as an aircraft ferry . She was ultimately broken up for scrap starting in 1967 . 
 = New York State Route 370 = 
 New York State Route 370 ( NY 370 ) is an east – west state highway in Central New York in the United States . It extends for 35 @.@ 23 miles ( 56 @.@ 70 km ) from an intersection with NY 104 and NY 104A south of the Wayne County village of Red Creek to a junction with U.S. Route 11 ( US 11 ) in the Onondaga County city of Syracuse . The western and central portions of the route pass through mostly rural areas ; however , the eastern section serves densely populated areas of Onondaga County , including the villages of Baldwinsville and Liverpool . NY 370 also passes through Cayuga County , where it connects to NY 34 , a major north – south highway in Central New York . 
 NY 370 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York as a Red Creek – Liverpool highway , replacing NY 40 west of Cato and New York State Route 37 from Cato to Baldwinsville . From Liverpool to Syracuse , modern NY 370 was initially part of NY 57 , a route that continued north from Liverpool to Oswego . That route was eliminated in 1982 , at which time NY 370 was extended eastward to Syracuse over NY 57 's former routing . Other minor changes , namely a series of realignments west of Victory , have also occurred in the years since NY 370 was assigned . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Maintenance of the route is also split in a similar fashion . West of Syracuse , the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) . Within Syracuse , the highway is city @-@ maintained . 
 = = = Red Creek to Baldwinsville = = = 
 NY 370 begins at an intersection with NY 104 and NY 104A south of the village of Red Creek in the northeastern Wayne County town of Wolcott . The route heads southwest from this spot , utilizing a northeastward extension of Ridge Road that was part of US 104 prior to the construction of the super two highway now used by NY 104 . After passing 0 @.@ 7 miles ( 1 @.@ 1 km ) of open farmland , the route breaks from Ridge Road and travels southeast toward the Cayuga County line . The rural surroundings follow NY 370 across the county line and into the town of Victory , where the highway briefly takes on a more easterly alignment as it intersects NY 38 in the town center . Past NY 38 , NY 370 gradually curves southward for roughly 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) to reach the Victory – Conquest town line . Here , it overtakes the east – west Conquest – Victory Town Line Road and heads eastward along the town line toward the village of Cato . 
 Just west of Cato village , NY 370 enters nearby Ira and the town of Cato . The route continues along the town line into the small village of Cato , where it becomes Main Street and meets NY 34 in the village center . At this point , NY 370 leaves the town line and heads northeast into Ira at the eastern village line . While in Ira , the highway leaves the village of Cato and passes by Cato – Meridian Central School , located in an otherwise nondescript area of the town dominated by farmland . At the school , the road curves back to the southeast to serve the village of Meridian and reenter the town of Cato . Here , the route reverts to a generally easterly alignment , one that it retains for the next 10 miles ( 16 km ) to Baldwinsville . East of Meridian , NY 370 crosses more cultivated fields as it intersects the south end of NY 176 and crosses into Onondaga County . 
 Across the county line , NY 370 enters the town of Lysander and becomes known as West Genesee Road . It runs across another 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) of rolling farmland before it begins to parallel the Erie Canal , here part of the Seneca River . At this point , the open fields gradually give way to pockets of residential development as the route approaches the village of Baldwinsville . West of the village limits , NY 370 connects to NY 31 and NY 690 at NY 690 's continuation of Interstate 690 's ( I @-@ 690 ) northernmost grade @-@ separated interchange . NY 31 — which overlaps with NY 690 south of the junction — leaves the freeway and joins NY 370 for a 2 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) overlap that takes both routes along the north bank of the canal and into the densely populated village . They remain overlapped through Baldwinsville 's central business district , where they meet NY 48 at Oswego Street . 
 = = = Syracuse area = = = 
 At the eastern edge of the village center , NY 31 and NY 370 split , with NY 31 retaining the Genesee Street name and heading northeast towards Oneida Lake . NY 370 , meanwhile , travels southeast on Salina Street , loosely paralleling the Erie Canal as it heads toward Syracuse . The route intersects NY 631 before leaving Baldwinsville and heading into another rural section of Lysander . This open stretch ends at the canalside hamlet of Cold Springs , which serves as the beginning of the Syracuse suburbs . After passing through the community , NY 370 crosses over the conjoined Erie Canal and Seneca River and enters the town of Salina . Not far from the canal is a junction with John Glenn Boulevard , a four @-@ lane arterial connecting NY 370 to Interstate 690 ( I @-@ 690 ) . 
 Past John Glenn Boulevard , NY 370 passes over the New York State Thruway ( Interstate 90 or I @-@ 90 ) near exit 38 and begins to approach the northern shore of Onondaga Lake as it enters the village of Liverpool on 2nd Street . In the village 's commercial center , NY 370 intersects Oswego Street , which connects to I @-@ 90 , once part of NY 57 and now NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route . Here , NY 370 turns onto Oswego Street for one block before veering southeastward onto Onondaga Lake Parkway , a four @-@ lane highway running along the northeastern shoreline of Onondaga Lake . This section of the route also parallels the CSX Transportation @-@ owned St. Lawrence Subdivision , which crosses the highway by way of a low , 10 @-@ foot @-@ 9 @-@ inch ( 3 @.@ 28 m ) overpass 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) southeast of Liverpool . 
 The parkway ends 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) from Liverpool at the eastern tip of the lake , where the route connects to I @-@ 81 at exit 24 . NY 370 continues through the interchange , following the two @-@ lane Park Street into the city of Syracuse . In its first few blocks in the city , the highway passes under the Mohawk Subdivision — CSX 's main line across Central New York — and serves both <unk> Bank Stadium and the Central New York Regional Market . East of the market , the route continues for one more block through an industrial area of Syracuse to Wolf Street , where NY 370 ends at US 11 and NY 298 Truck 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) northwest of downtown Syracuse . 
 = = History = = 
 The portion of NY 370 east of Oswego Street in Liverpool was originally designated as part of Route 34 , an unsigned legislative route , in 1908 . When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 , Route 34 became the basis for NY 20 , a highway extending from Syracuse to Oswego via Liverpool and Fulton . NY 20 was renumbered to NY 57 in 1927 to eliminate duplication with the newly assigned US 20 . To the west , the section of modern NY 370 from Upton Road west of the hamlet of Victory to NY 34 in Cato was designated as part of NY 40 in the mid @-@ 1920s . West of Victory , NY 40 followed Upton Road and Canada Street before terminating at NY 3 ( now NY 104A ) in Red Creek . 
 Although the portion of what is now NY 370 from Cato to Liverpool was state @-@ maintained by 1926 , it remained unnumbered until the late 1920s . At that time , the section west of then @-@ NY 31 ( now NY 48 ) in Baldwinsville became NY 37 . The designation proved to be short @-@ lived as it was renumbered to NY 370 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . At the same time , NY 40 was split into several different routes . From Cato to just east of Red Creek , old NY 40 became part of the new NY 370 , which also extended southeastward to NY 57 in Liverpool . The small segment of former NY 40 from NY 3 to Upton Road was included in NY 3E ( later US 104 ) . 
 The portion of NY 370 west of Victory was realigned in the late 1950s to follow its modern alignment to a new terminus at US 104 ( Ridge Road ) southwest of Red Creek . After US 104 ( now NY 104 ) was rerouted to follow a new super two highway through the Red Creek area in the early 1970s , the portion of Ridge Road between the super two east of Wolcott and NY 370 southwest of Red Creek became a westward extension of NY 370 . The route was altered slightly at some point in the late 1970s or early 1980s to follow Ridge Road northeast to NY 104 instead . 
 In May 1982 , the NY 57 designation was eliminated after the portion of the route north of Liverpool was removed from the state highway system . From Tulip Street to the Onondaga – Oswego county line , NY 57 was redesignated as County Route 91 ( CR 91 ) but signed as CR 57 . The portion of NY 57 's former routing between NY 370 in Liverpool and US 11 in Syracuse became part of an extended NY 370 .

 = Politics of Svalbard = 
 Svalbard lies under the sovereignty of Norway , but the Svalbard Treaty places several restrictions . Norway cannot use the archipelago for warlike purposes , cannot discriminate economic activity based on nationality and is required to conserve the natural environment . Uniquely , Svalbard is entirely visa @-@ free zone . Everybody may live and work in Svalbard indefinitely regardless country of citizenship . Svalbard Treaty grants treaty nationals equal right of abode as Norwegian nationals . Non @-@ treaty nationals may live and work indefinitely visa @-@ free as well . " Regulations concerning rejection and expulsion from Svalbard " is in force on non @-@ discriminatory basis . 
 Public administration of the archipelago is the responsibility of the Governor of Svalbard , who acts as county governor and chief of police . The institution was established by and is regulated by the Svalbard Act , which also limits which Norwegian laws apply to the islands . Longyearbyen Community Council is the only elected local government and is organized similar to a mainland municipality . Other Norwegian government agencies with a presence are the Directorate of Mining and the Tax Administration . The only diplomatic mission is the Consulate of Russia in Barentsburg . 
 The archipelago was spotted in 1596 , and soon companies from England , the Netherlands , Denmark – Norway and France were whaling and hunting . Both England and Denmark – Norway claimed the land , while the Dutch and France claimed the mare liberum principle , resulting in Svalbard becoming terra nullius — land without sovereignty . Work on establishing a public administration started in the 1870s , but did not progress until the 1900s , when the establishment of coal mining communities created a more urgent need . The Svalbard Treaty was signed following the Paris Peace Conference in 1920 , and the governor and act came into effect in 1925 . By then only Norwegian and Russian communities remained . 
 After the Second World War and the outbreak of the Cold War , Svalbard became polarized with Norwegian and Soviet communities isolated from each other . Norway carried out a more defensive foreign policy on Svalbard compared to on the mainland , and foreign activity was held at a minimum . The Soviet Union issued protests against virtually all new Norwegian activity . At the time there were twice as many Soviet citizens as Norwegians on the islands . More than half the archipelago was conserved in 1973 . Since the 1990s Longyearbyen has become " normalized " , abandoned the company town structure and seen its population doubled . On the other hand , the Soviet communities have dwindled , with only a few hundred residents remaining in Barentsburg .

 = = = Terra nullius = = = 
 Svalbard was undoubtedly spotted by Willem Barentsz of the Netherlands in 1596 , although it may have previously have been discovered by Norsemen or Pomors . The Muscovy Company of England started walrus hunting on Bjørnøya in 1604 , and from 1611 the company 's Jonas Poole started whaling around Spitsbergen . The following year the Muscovy Company sent a new expedition , but was met by both Dutch and Spanish whalers . The company claimed exclusive rights to the area and sent away the contenders . In 1613 , seven armed English ships were sent on an expedition that expelled a few dozen Dutch , Spanish and French vessels . 
 This led to an international political conflict . The Dutch rejected exclusive rights for the English , claiming the mare liberum principle . Christian IV claimed that Denmark – Norway had the rights to all of the Northern Sea in lieu of Greenland being an old Norwegian tax @-@ land , and it was believed at the time by all parties that Spitsbergen was part of Greenland . England offered to purchase the rights from Denmark – Norway in 1614 , but the offer was rejected , after which the English reverted to their exclusive rights claim . Denmark – Norway sent three man @-@ of @-@ wars in 1615 to collect taxes from English and Dutch whalers , but all refused to pay . 
 The English claimed sovereignty based on the false claim that Svalbard was discovered by Hugh Willoughby in 1553 , that James I had annexed it in 1614 and that it was the English who had started whaling . The Netherlands stated that whaling could not be the basis for claiming sovereignty . The issue ended in a political deadlock , with Denmark – Norway and England both claiming sovereignty and France , the Netherlands and Spain claiming the archipelago a free zone under mare liberum . Although Denmark – Norway never formally gave up its claim to Svalbard , the archipelago continued to be a terra nullius — a land without a government . 
 The English and Dutch partitioned the island in 1614 , as the aggression was hampering the profitability of both groups . That year the Netherlands created <unk> Compagnie as a whaling cartel . After the Muscovy Company fell into financial difficulties some years later , the <unk> Compagnie got the upper hand and was able to dominate the whaling and fend off the English . The company established itself in the northwestern corner of Spitsbergen ( around Albert I Land ) and only permitted a limited Danish presence . The English <unk> further south , while the French were allocated to the north coast and the open sea . From the 1630s , the situation stabilized , and there were only a limited number of aggressive incidents . By the end of the 18th century , whaling had ceased as the bowhead whale had reached local extinction . 
 = = = Establishing jurisdiction = = = 
 Work on establish an administration was initiated by Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld in 1871 . After contacting the invested governments , he concluded that only Russia and Norway would object to an annexation of the island . Fridtjof Nansen 's endeavors raised the Norwegian public 's consciousness of the Arctic , which again brought forth public support for annexation of Svalbard . Industrialization and permanent settlements on Svalbard began in the 1900s with the introduction of coal mining . This resulted in the need for jurisdiction . Firstly , there was no means to make a mining claim legal . Secondly , there was a need for conflict resolution , particularly regarding labor conflicts , which often saw the mining company and the workers have different nationalities . 
 The Government of Norway took initiative in 1907 for negotiations between the involved states . Multilateral conferences were held in 1910 , 1912 and 1914 , all of which proposed various types of joint rule . The breakthrough came at the Paris Peace Conference following the First World War . Germany and Russia had both been excluded , while Norway enjoyed much goodwill after its neutral ally policy during the war and was at the same time seen as harmless . The Svalbard Treaty of 9 February 1920 granted Norway full sovereignty over Svalbard , although with two major limitations : all parties to the treaty had equal rights to economic resources , and the archipelago was not to be used for " warlike purposes " . 
 After significant political debate , a proposal to establish Svalbard as a dependency and administrate it from Tromsø was rejected . Instead the Svalbard Act specified that the islands would be administered by the Governor of Svalbard and were considered " part of the Kingdom of Norway " , although not regarded as a county . The islands had until then been known as the Spitsbergen Archipelago , and it was at this time the term Svalbard was introduced . The legislation took effect on 14 August 1925 . A mining code was passed in 1925 , and by 1927 all mining claims , some of which conflicted , were resolved . All unclaimed land was taken over by the Government of Norway . Although the Soviet Union was initially skeptical to the treaty , its government was willing to sign in exchange for a Norwegian recognition of the Soviet regime . Until the Second World War , both the governor and the Commissioner of Mining were a single person , stationed on the mainland during the winter . 
 = = = Cold War = = = 
 Mining fell into an economic slump during the 1920s , resulting in several of the mining communities being closed . By the 1930s only Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani and the Soviet state @-@ owned Arktikugol were left , which led to a <unk> of politics . The archipelago was evacuated during the Second World War and the major settlements leveled by Germany during Operation Zitronella . The Soviet Union proposed in 1944 that Svalbard become a condominium under joint Norwegian and Soviet rule , except for Bjørnøya , which would be transferred to the Soviet Union . Although the proposal was discussed in Norway , it was ultimately rejected in 1947 . The Norwegian and Russian communities were largely built independent of each other and each had their own infrastructure , such as postal service , radio stations and transport . The Norwegian population stabilized at about 1 @,@ 000 people , while there were about twice as many Soviets . 
 The political tension between Norway and the Soviet Union became heated after Norway joined NATO in 1949 . The Soviet Union issued memorandums to Norway stating that Svalbard could not be under a NATO joint command , but this was rejected by Norway , and the issue laid at rest . A new protest was issued in 1958 after Norsk Polar <unk> proposed building an private airport at Ny @-@ Ålesund , which was then actively opposed by the Norwegian government in order to not agitate the Soviet Union . New protests were issued against the establishment of the European Space Research Organization 's Kongsfjord Telemetry Station , although the protests did not stop construction . A compromise about a Norwegian civilian airport was reached in 1971 and Svalbard Airport , Longyear opened in 1975 , serving both Soviet and Norwegian towns . 
 Twenty @-@ one miners were killed in an accident in Ny @-@ Ålesund in 1962 . The resulting Kings Bay Affair , where unsafe mining had been approved to maintain an increased Norwegian presence on Svalbard , ultimately led to vote of no confidence in Parliament and the withdrawal of Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen 's third cabinet . Oil drilling was started by Caltex in 1961 . Caltex was granted claims based on indications of oil , rather than samples . Arktikugol was not granted claims based on similar evidence , contributing to tensions with the Soviet Union . Both the Kings Bay Affair and the Caltex Affair initiated public debate about the administration of Svalbard , and in particular the lack of resources and control of Soviet settlements . Funding for local and central administration was increased heavily , and the Governor increased its activities in Soviet settlements . More than half the archipelago was protected in 1972 through four national parks , fourteen bird sanctuaries and four nature reserves . Store Norske was nationalized between 1973 and 1976 .

 The Svalbard Council was established on 1 November 1971 . It consisted of 17 nonpartisan members who were elected or appointed from three different Norwegian groups — SNSK employees , government employees and others , although the ratio changed several times . Svalbard Samfunnsdrift ( SSD ) , a limited company which was responsible for public infrastructure and services in Longyearbyen , was established by Store Norske on 1 January 1989 . Responsibilities included healthcare , the fire department , the kindergarten , roads , garbage disposal , power production , the water and sewer system , the cinema , cultural actives and the library . Ownership of SSD was taken over by the Ministry of Trade and Industry on 1 January 1993 . During the 1990s the authorities started a process to " normalize " Longyearbyen by abolishing the company town scheme and introducing a full range of services , a varied economy and local democracy . The Svalbard Council changed its regulations from 1993 and allowed parties to run for election . Longyearbyen Community Council was established in 2002 , replacing the Svalbard Council and assimilating SSD . From 1990 to 2011 , the Russian and Ukrainian population fell from 2 @,@ 300 to 370 , while the Norwegian population increased from 1 @,@ 100 to 2 @,@ 000 .

 The Svalbard Treaty was signed on 9 February 1920 and came into effect on 14 August 1925 . The treaty defines Svalbard as all islands , islets and skerries from 74 ° to 81 ° north latitude , and from 10 ° to 35 ° east longitude . It secures full Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago , but contains several restrictions : peaceful use of the islands , the non @-@ discrimination of citizens and companies of signatory countries , the obligation to protect the natural environment and limitations in taxation . The treaty has 39 signatories . 
 The Svalbard Act was passed on 17 June 1925 and establishes that Svalbard is " part of the Kingdom of Norway " . It further stipulates that civil law , criminal law and procedural law applies to Svalbard , but that other provisions only apply if specifically stipulated . As of 2008 there were 31 regulations which applied to Svalbard . The act also dictates the administration of Svalbard , notably establishing the governor and the Commissioner of Mines . 
 The Svalbard Environmental Protection Act was passed on 15 June 2001 and took effect on 1 July 2002 , replacing various regulations . The act was created to secure a continuous , nearly untouched natural environment on Svalbard , particularly regarding wilderness , landscape , flora , fauna and cultural heritage . The act is enacted by the Ministry of the Environment , the Climate and Pollution Agency , the governor , the Directorate for Cultural Heritage and the Directorate for Nature Management . The act is supplemented by various regulations . Specific issues addressed in the act include the protection of plants and all remains of all human activity up to 1945 . It imposes limitations on traffic in permitted areas , particularly motorized vehicles , but allows locals to operate <unk> in more areas than tourists . Two @-@ thirds of Svalbard is protected through national parks and nature reserves .

 The Governor of Svalbard ( Norwegian : <unk> ) is the principal representative of the Government of Norway in Svalbard . The institution is located in Longyearbyen and has since 2009 been led by Governor Odd Olsen <unk> . The institution 's main responsibilities are implementing Norwegian policies , safeguarding Norwegian rights and obligations and representing Svalbard in relation to central authorities . Specifically , the governor acts as chief of police , holds the authority of a county governor and enacts family law . The institution has 30 employees and is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and Public Security . 
 Svalbard is a police district of the Norwegian Police Service , with the governor having the responsibilities of both sheriff and chief of police . This includes security ; law and order enforcement , including traffic controls ; case investigation ; and preventative systems . The governor is responsible for search and rescue and is head of the local rescue station and subordinate of the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway in Bodø . The institution is also responsible for issuing of driver 's licences , vehicle registration , passports and firearms licenses . The governor and his deputy represent the public prosecutors . 
 The governor is also responsible for environmental protection , including nature supervision , environmental monitoring , species management , management of cultural heritage sites , administration of tourism and travel , oil spill contingency and safeguarding of the environment . The agency maintains two helicopters , a Eurocopter <unk> Super Puma and a Eurocopter <unk> Dauphin , the inspection vessel <unk> as well as lighter equipment such as snowmobiles , cars and boats . The governor 's jurisdiction applies to all land and the territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles ( 22 km ; 14 mi ) from land .

 = = Issues = = 
 = = = Peaceful use = = = 
 Article 9 of the Svalbard Treaty specifies that no fortifications and naval bases may be built on Svalbard , nor can the archipelago be used for " warlike purposes " . The preparatory work of the treaty and later state practice has been to enforce that no military activity is carried out on the archipelago ; however , the treaty as such does not ban , for instance , the construction of air stations or military installations not regarded as defense works . There is scholarly consensus that Article 9 is unclear , but that a military presence should only be established when there is an attack or threat of attack on Svalbard . Norway can clearly not use Svalbard to make a threat of war , but retains the right to self @-@ defense against an attack on Svalbard . However , the right does not allow Norway to bring Svalbard into war as part of self @-@ defense of other parts of the country . 
 The waters around Svalbard are of strategic significance for Russia as the Northern Fleet must pass through the area to reach the Atlantic Ocean . The concern of the Soviet Union and Russia was therefore to ensure that listening stations and anti @-@ submarine warfare installations were not placed on the archipelago . Except during the Second World War , Norway has never stationed any military troops on Svalbard . However , the Norwegian Coast Guard carries out surveillance . There were many protests during the Cold War from the Soviet Union against Norwegian activity on the island , including purely civil arrangements . The Soviet Union issued many memorandums protesting such installations as satellite ground stations and airports , and even the filming of Orion 's Belt , on the grounds that it could be a cover for or had the potential for being used for military activities . 
 = = = Sovereignty = = = 
 Norway was prior to 1920 extremely active in gaining international support for Norwegian sovereignty , but following the treaty , Norwegian interest in the archipelago dwindled . From the start of the Cold War , Norwegian politicians wanted to avoid bringing the islands into superpower politics . This resulted in a policy of avoiding agitating the Soviet Union , which again resulted in the Norwegian authorities actively working against both Norwegian and foreign activities on Svalbard which could raise tensions . Compared to mainland relations , which were dominated by deterring through NATO membership , the Norwegian policy on Svalbard was related to calming the Soviet Union . Similarly , while a foreign presence was encouraged on the mainland , it was strongly discouraged on Svalbard . 
 Nearly all Norwegian activity during the Cold War resulted in a protest from the Soviet Union , which claimed , without basis in the treaty , that the archipelago was a demilitarized zone . The Soviet Union would protest against any foreign and most new Norwegian activity on the grounds that it violated Article 9 , even if it was not remotely related to military activity . The fear of such a reaction led Norway to disallow practically all foreign and innovative use of the archipelago . Norway essentially had a " non @-@ policy " managing Svalbard with a defensive and inconsequential reaction every time activity was proposed . 
 Norway established a fisheries protection area surrounding Svalbard on 15 June 1977 , which strictly regulates fisheries , but on a non @-@ discriminatory basis . The zone extends 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ; 230 mi ) beyond the territorial waters . Norway maintains that the treaty 's non @-@ discrimination @-@ policy only applies to land and the territorial waters and that Norway is free to establish an economic zone beyond that . Fishing vessels from Norway , Iceland , the Faeroe Islands , Russian and the European Union are awarded quotas for cod and herring ; these and Greenland and Canada have been issued quotas for shrimp . Norway and the Soviet Union , later Russia , disagreed regarding the border between the two counties ' exclusive economic zones in the Barents Sea . Norway claimed the internationally recognized equidistance principle should apply , while Russia claimed that the unilateral meridian line be used . The issue was resolved with a compromise in 2010 . 
 = = = Non @-@ discrimination = = = 
 The treaty ensures that all citizens and companies from signatory countries receive equal rights of access and residence . Norway may not discriminate — based on nationality — the rights to fish , hunt and conduct mining , trade , industry and maritime activity . However , these activities may be limited by non @-@ discriminatory legislation . Thus Norway is permitted to place regulations and prohibitions on basis of other objective criteria , or ban certain activities altogether or in certain geographic areas . The non @-@ discrimination clause also does not ban nationality discrimination elsewhere than in economic activity . Specifically , research and scientific activities do not fall under the non @-@ discrimination clause . 
 A central part of the non @-@ discrimination policy is the Mining Code of 7 August 1925 . It is uncertain if the code is internationally binding , or if it can be amended unilaterally by Norway . Specifically , the commissioner issues licenses to search for minerals and state @-@ owned and other owner 's land and to register claims . To maintain a claim , the owner must work 1 @,@ 500 man @-@ hours per five years and pay an annual fee of 6 @,@ 000 Norwegian krone . However , the Ministry of Trade and Industry may grant exceptions from the work obligation under specific conditions . 
 The treaty only allows taxation to the extent that it covers the cost of administrating the archipelago and covering the services provided to the residents . The tax rate is therefore significantly lower than in Metropolitan Norway , including the absence of value added tax . The government summarizes its expenses on Svalbard in the Svalbard Budget . The taxation rules made Svalbard a tax paradise , and in 2009 the oil rig operator <unk> established a subsidiary in Longyearbyen to exploit the lower taxes . In 2011 , the tax rate for profits exceeding NOK 10 million were raised from 16 to 28 percent — the same as on the mainland . 
 = Peckforton Castle = 
 Peckforton Castle is a Victorian country house built in the style of a medieval castle . It stands in woodland at the north end of Peckforton Hills 1 mile ( 2 km ) northwest of the village of Peckforton , Cheshire , England . It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building . The house was built in the middle of the 19th century as a family home for John Tollemache , a wealthy Cheshire landowner , estate manager , and Member of Parliament . It was designed by Anthony Salvin in the Gothic style . During the Second World War it was used as a hostel for physically handicapped children . 
 The Tollemache family used the castle for occasional gatherings , but otherwise it was unused until 1969 . From 1969 to 1980 the castle was leased by Lord John Tollemache to George W. Barrett , and it again became a private residence and closed to the public . The right wing and tower and the castle gardens were restored to their former glory by Barrett , an American employed by the U.S. Government . His daughter Pascale 's wedding was the first to be held in the chapel and a special decree had to be obtained by the Archbishop of Canterbury to legally hold catholic weddings in the grounds of the castle . During the 1970s and 1980s it was used as a location for shooting films and television programmes . The castle was bought in 1988 by Evelyn Graybill , who converted it into a hotel . In 2006 it was purchased by the Naylor family , who expanded its use to include hosting weddings , conferences , and other functions . 
 = = Early history = = 
 Peckforton Castle was built between 1844 and 1850 for John Tollemache , the largest landowner in Cheshire at the time , who was described by William Ewart Gladstone as " the greatest estate manager of his day " . Tollemache 's first choice of architect was George Latham of Nantwich , but he was not appointed , and was paid £ 2 @,@ 000 ( £ 180 thousand today ) in compensation . Instead Tollemache appointed Anthony Salvin , who had a greater reputation and more experience , and who had already carried out work on the Tollemache manor house , <unk> Hall in Suffolk . The castle was built by Dean and Son of Leftwich , with Joseph Cookson of Tarporley acting as clerk of works . Stone was obtained from a quarry about 1 mile ( 2 km ) to the west of the site , and a railway was built to carry the stone . The castle cost £ 60 @,@ 000 ( about £ 5 @.@ 8 million as of 2016 ) . 
 Although it was built as a family home its design was that of a medieval castle . It has a gatehouse , a portcullis , a dry moat , external windows that are little more than arrow slots , and large towers . In 1851 The Illustrated London News said that it " seems to exhibit the peculiar beauties of Carnarvon Castle without its inconveniences " and in 1858 Sir George Gilbert Scott called it " the largest and most carefully and <unk> executed Gothic mansion of the present " and that it was " the very height of masquerading " . It is regarded as " the last serious fortified home built in England " and " it was executed to the highest standards and is one of the great buildings of its age " . 
 There has been debate about the motives for building a more @-@ or @-@ less complete medieval @-@ style castle in the 19th century . Although he was a great estate manager , Tollemache was also perceived as " a man of considerable eccentricity " . Dr Jill Allibone is of the opinion that he might have been protecting himself and his family from the political troubles of the time . In a defensive building he would be able to protect himself against any revolution by the masses from nearby Manchester or Liverpool . A possible practical reason for building such a solid residence rather than an Italianate @-@ style villa was to provide shelter from the adverse weather conditions which could affect the Cheshire plain . However <unk> comes to the conclusion that the decisive factors were to use his " vast inheritance " to provide himself with a house that was " impressive , dominant and suitable for Cheshire 's greatest landowner " .

 Before moving into the castle in the 1890s , Wilbraham Tollemache , 2nd Baron Tollemache added central heating and electric light . In 1922 a large scheme of afforestation was started on the Peckforton Hills , and the resulting woodland has been granted the status of a Site of Special Scientific Interest . Bentley Tollemache , 3rd Baron Tollemache – grandson of Wilbraham Tollemache – and his family left Peckforton at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 . During the war the castle was used as a hostel for physically handicapped children who had been evacuated from the London area . Bentley Tollemache died in 1955 and , as he had no sons , the estate passed to his cousin , John Tollemache . During the 1970s , 1980s and early 1990s , the castle was used as a location for shooting films and television programmes . These include the Doctor Who serial The Time Warrior , broadcast in 1973 – 74 , and a 1991 movie of Robin Hood starring Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman . From 1982 to 1986 , Treasure Trap , one of the world 's first live action role @-@ playing games took place on the site . In 1988 the castle was purchased by an American , Evelyn Graybill , for £ 1 million . She renovated most of the building and secured planning permission to convert it into a hotel . In 2006 Chris Naylor was married in the castle , following which the Naylor family bought the property . Peckforton Castle is now used as a luxury hotel and a venue for corporate events and weddings . The building was severely damaged by fire in June 2011 during a wedding , the cost of the damage being in the region of £ 6 million . In December 2011 the bridegroom admitted to a charge of arson .

He received the Medal of Honor for his actions on July 20 and 21 , 1950 , during the Battle of Taejon in South Korea . Dean was also the highest ranking American officer captured by the North Koreans during the Korean War . 
 Born in Illinois , Dean attended the University of California at Berkeley before graduating with a commission in the US Army through the Reserve Officer 's Training Corps ( ROTC ) in 1921 . Slowly rising up the ranks in the inter @-@ war years , Dean worked a desk job in Washington D.C. for much of World War II before being transferred to the 44th Infantry Division which he later commanded during the final days of the war , and was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross . 
 Dean is known for commanding the 24th Infantry Division at the outbreak of the Korean War . Dean led the division for several weeks in unsuccessful delaying battles against the North Koreans , before he led his division in making a last stand at Taejon . During the confused retreat from that city , Dean was separated from his soldiers and badly injured , and was eventually captured by the North Koreans . He remained in North Korean custody near P 'yongyang for the remainder of the war . After the end of the conflict , Dean returned to the United States to a hero 's welcome . He retired from the Army soon after and lived a quiet life until his death .

 Dean was born on August 1 , 1899 , in Carlyle , Illinois to Charles Watts Dean , who worked as a dentist , and Elizabeth <unk> Dean , who was of German descent . William Dean had two siblings , a brother named David and a sister named Elizabeth . Dean states in his biography his interest in the military began at a very young age , upon seeing the United States Military Academy cadets in the 1904 Saint Louis Exposition performing military drill . During his childhood , Dean was interested in physical fitness , and began weightlifting and running , activities he would continue throughout much of his life . His first jobs included selling magazines for spending money . Growing up in Carlyle , Dean was the town 's main paperboy for The Saturday Evening Post . 
 After graduating from high school , Dean applied to the US Military Academy , but was rejected . He then tried to enlist in the United States Army during World War I , but he was too young to do so without his parents ' permission , and his mother refused . Dean instead attended University of California at Berkeley studying pre @-@ law . During this time , he also took a variety of side jobs , including a stevedore at the San Francisco docks , a motorman , and briefly as a patrolman for the Berkeley Police Department , where he worked under police chief August Vollmer . Dean originally sought to attain a Doctor of Law degree but only completed a Bachelor of Arts degree from Berkeley in 1922 before joining the Army .

 Dean , who had been a member of Berkeley 's ROTC , was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the California Army National Guard in 1921 , before being given an active duty commission in the infantry on October 13 , 1923 . His first assignment was to the US 38th Infantry Regiment , 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Douglas , Utah . During this posting , Dean took an interest in polo ponies , owning and training several of his own . 
 Dean was moved to the Panama Canal Zone in 1926 , coaching boxing and basketball teams though not competing himself . Dean returned to Fort Douglas in 1929 before attending the United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning , Georgia and then serving with a tank battalion before taking a course at the tank school . In 1932 , Dean was assigned to the US 30th Infantry Regiment , 3rd Infantry Division on the US West Coast . During this time , Dean also served in the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) as commander of Camp <unk> in northern California . Dean was then moved to the CCC headquarters in Redding , California . 
 Following these appointments , Dean attended the US Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas before being assigned to a post on Oahu , Hawaii for two years . Following this stint , Dean attended the Armed Forces Industrial College at Fort McNair , Washington D.C. and then the field officer 's course at the Chemical Warfare school in the United States Army War College at Carlisle Barracks . Dean was promoted to captain in 1936 , and major in 1940 . Upon this promotion , Dean was assigned to Washington D.C. on the United States Department of War on the General Staff , first as a junior member , then as assistant secretary , then as executive officer in the Requirement Division of the Ground Forces Headquarters , a department concerned with the acquisition of new weapons and electronics , and training literature .

 Following the United States ' entry into World War II , Dean was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel in 1941 , and colonel in 1942 . He was promoted to brigadier general later that year and made head of the Requirements Division in 1943 . He held this office only briefly , before being assigned as assistant commander of the US 44th Infantry Division , under Major General James I. Muir in late 1943 . The division was to sail for the European Theater and Dean went with them despite being injured shortly before departure in a flamethrower accident which claimed the lives of two other soldiers . Dean was promoted to major general in late 1943 . 
 The 44th Infantry Division landed in France via Omaha Beach on September 15 , 1944 . It trained for a month before entering combat on October 18 , 1944 , when it relieved the US 79th Infantry Division in the vicinity of <unk> de <unk> , east of <unk> , to take part in the Seventh United States Army drive to secure several passes in the Vosges Mountains . The division was hit by a heavy counterattack by forces of Nazi Germany on October 25 – 26 . The attack was repulsed and the 44th remained in the sector for several weeks . On November 13 , 1944 , it attacked northeast , advancing through the Vosges Mountains east of <unk> to <unk> , and capturing <unk> , on November 17 . The division then pushed on to liberate Strasbourg with the French 2nd Armored Division . After regrouping , the 44th Infantry Division returned to the attack , taking <unk> and entering the Ensemble de Bitche along the Maginot Line . 
 When division commander Major General Robert L. <unk> was injured and relieved of command in December 1944 , Dean was promoted to command the division . That month , the division was caught up in the German Army offensive in the Alsace , known as Operation Nordwind . Fort <unk> was captured by the Germans on December 19 and the 44th Infantry Division was forced to retreat to defensive positions east of Sarreguemines . On December 21 – 23 , the 44th threw back three attempts by the Germans to cross the <unk> River . An aggressive defense of the Sarreguemines area was continued throughout February and most of March 1945 . 
 The division moved across the Rhine River at Worms , Germany on March 26 , in the wake of the 3rd Infantry Division . The 44th relieved the 3rd on March 26 – 27 and crossed the Neckar River to attack and capture Mannheim , Germany on March 28 – 29 . Shifting to the west bank of the Main River , the division crossed that river at Grosse <unk> in early April , and engaged in a three @-@ week period of training . Returning to the lines , the division resumed its attack on April 18 in conjunction with the US 10th Armored Division , the 44th took <unk> on April 23 , crossed the Danube River . It then attacked southeast into Austria , taking Füssen , Berg , and <unk> as part of a drive to Imst . Pursuing the disintegrating German forces through Fern Pass and into Inn Valley , the 44th was in Imst by May 4 . The city of <unk> surrendered on May 5 . The 19th German Army had surrendered at Innsbruck the same day , and the division was involved in processing German prisoners until V @-@ E Day on May 8 . Dean 's troops took 30 @,@ 000 prisoners of war in the surrender of the German army . Dean was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross , the Legion of Merit , and the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his leadership of the division during the war . 
 After a short period of occupation duty , the 44th Infantry Division returned to the United States in July 1945 where it began training for deployment to the Pacific Theater . As part of Operation Coronet it was intended that Dean would lead the division during the planned invasion of Honshū , but the war came to an end before this took place and the operation was subsequently cancelled . Dean then oversaw the drawdown of the division until he was relieved of command on November 1 , 1945 . The 44th Infantry Division was disbanded by the end of that month .

 After he was relieved of command of the 44th Infantry Division , Dean was assigned to Fort Leavenworth again to organize and direct command classes . In October 1947 , Dean was appointed the commander of military forces in South Korea , deputy to military governor Lieutenant General John R. Hodge , the commander of the United States Army Military Government in Korea . This job was temporary as the US forces transitioned the South Koreans to independence . Headquartered in Seoul , Dean maintained political control of the country until August 15 , 1948 when the new South Korean government was elected and the occupation ended . Dean was then made commander of the US 7th Infantry Division , overseeing its movement from South Korea to bases in Japan as part of the Occupation of Japan . By January 1949 , Dean and his division were in Sapporo , Japan on the island of Hokkaido . He was moved to Yokohama in May 1949 to serve as chief of staff to the Eighth United States Army under Lieutenant General Walton Walker . In October 1949 Dean returned to division command when he took command of the US 24th Infantry Division in Kokura , Kyushu .

 = = = = Delaying action = = = = 
 At the outbreak of the Korean War on June 25 , 1950 , Dean 's division was the closest US ground unit to the Korean Peninsula . General of the Army Douglas MacArthur ordered Walker to deploy the division to South Korea as quickly as possible to resist the advancing forces of North Korea . Dean was ordered to send an advance battalion from his division by air to South Korea with a mission to advance and resist leading elements of the North Korean People 's Army in an effort to delay them as much as possible while the remainder of the division followed by sea . Dean was given command of all US forces in Korea , and his division numbered 15 @,@ 965 men and 4 @,@ 773 vehicles at the time . On July 1 , Dean organized the 406 @-@ man Task Force Smith from components of the US 21st Infantry Regiment and ordered it into Korea , as the advance force . As Task Force Smith advanced , Dean himself landed in Taejon on July 3 and set up his command post with Brigadier General John H. Church , the Assistant Division Commander , and Brigadier General George B. Barth , the Division Artillery commander , as his deputies . Dean ordered Barth forward to act as his forward commander for Task Force Smith , which began digging in at Osan to resist North Korean troops advancing after the capture of Seoul . Task Force Smith was subsequently defeated by North Koreans at the Battle of Osan the next day , and pushed back . 
 With the defeat of Task Force Smith , Dean ordered the US 34th Infantry Regiment and other elements of the division to conduct delaying actions south of Osan , but he was disappointed and frustrated by the result . The 34th Infantry was badly defeated in the Battle of Pyongtaek where it only briefly resisted the North Koreans before retreating in disarray . Dean was angered by the poor performance of the 34th Infantry Regiment during the battle . He allegedly was upset that the regiment retreated so quickly without attempting to further delay the North Koreans . He considered ordering the regiment back north immediately but did not do so fearing the unit would be ambushed . Dean replaced the commander of the 34th Infantry , Colonel Jay B. Lovless , and ordered the 3rd Battalion back north , but when it encountered North Korean resistance it immediately became disorganized and was forced to withdraw . The North Koreans outnumbered Dean 's troops , and the US forces had no weapons heavy enough to destroy the North Korean T @-@ 34 tanks . 
 Following the retreat from Pyongtaek , the scattered 1st Battalion , 34th Infantry retreated to Chonan , where the rest of the 34th Infantry Regiment was located . L Company of the 3rd Battalion , 34th Infantry was ordered to probe north of the city and meet the advancing elements of the North Korean 4th Infantry Division which was advancing following its two victories . Dean telegraphed the command from Taejon , ordering the rest of 3rd Battalion , 34th Infantry to move up behind L Company . Former regimental commander Lovless moved north to join L Company , along with newly arrived Colonel Robert R. Martin , a friend of Dean 's . Around 18 : 00 , Dean ordered Martin to take command of the 34th Infantry Regiment from Lovless . The next morning , July 8 , Dean and Walker arrived to see the outcome of the Battle of Chonan which had begun in the night . They discovered Martin had been killed and the regiment again defeated and fleeing in disarray . He ordered it back to the Kum River . Dean ordered the rest of the 21st Infantry to conduct one final delaying action , and in the Battle of Chochiwon from July 10 – 12 it delayed the North Koreans before being defeated and forced back to the Kum River . 
 = = = = Taejon = = = = 
 On July 12 , Dean ordered the division 's three regiments — the US 19th , 21st and 34th Infantry Regiments — to cross the Kum River , destroying all bridges behind them , and to establish defensive positions around Taejon . Dean formed a line with the 34th Infantry and 19th Infantry facing east , and held the heavily battered 21st Infantry in reserve to the southeast . Taejon stood as a major transportation hub between Seoul and Taegu , giving it great strategic value for both sides . The division was attempting to make a stand at Taejon , the last place it could conduct a delaying action before the North Korean forces could converge on the unfinished Pusan Perimeter . 
 The 24th Infantry Division 's three infantry regiments , which had a wartime strength of 3 @,@ 000 each , were already below strength on their deployment , and heavy losses in the preceding two weeks had reduced their numbers further . The 21st Infantry had 1 @,@ 100 men left , having suffered 1 @,@ 433 casualties . The 34th Infantry had only 2 @,@ 020 and the 19th had 2 @,@ 276 men . There were another 2 @,@ 007 men in the 24th Infantry Division artillery formations . Thus the division 's total strength was 11 @,@ 400 . This was severely reduced from the 15 @,@ 965 men and 4 @,@ 773 vehicles that had arrived in Korea at the beginning of the month . 
 The 19th and 34th Regiments engaged the North Korean 3rd Division and 4th Division at the Kum River , just west of Taejon . Between July 13 and July 16 , the two regiments suffered 650 casualties among the 3 @,@ 401 men committed there . On July 18 , Walker ordered Dean to hold Taejon until July 20 so that the US 1st Cavalry Division and US 25th Infantry Division could establish defensive lines along the Naktong River , forming the Pusan Perimeter . 
 The North Koreans then moved against Taejon . On July 19 , North Korean forces entered Taejon , the site of the 24th Infantry Division 's headquarters . Dean personally led the division in its stand at Taejon . The North Koreans quickly surrounded the city and moved in from the west , north and south . 
 For two days , the 34th Infantry fought the advancing North Koreans in bitter house @-@ to @-@ house fighting . North Korean soldiers continued to infiltrate the city , often disguised as farmers . The remaining elements of the 24th Infantry Division were pushed back block by block . Without radios , and unable to communicate with the remaining elements of the division , Dean joined the men on the front lines , hunting the T @-@ 34 tanks with the help of the new shaped @-@ charge , armor @-@ piercing 3 @.@ 5 inch " Super Bazookas " , which had only been put into production two weeks before the war . At one point , Dean personally attacked a tank with a hand grenade , destroying it . He also repeatedly directed the fire of US armor in the city while being exposed to North Korean fire . American forces pulled back gradually after suffering heavy losses , allowing the North Korean 3rd and 4th Divisions to move on the city freely from the north , south , and west roads . The 24th Infantry Division repeatedly attempted to establish its defensive lines , but was repeatedly pushed back by the numerically superior enemy . 
 = = = = Separation = = = = 
 At the end of the day on July 20 , Dean ordered the headquarters of the 34th Infantry to withdraw . Dean remained behind and assisted the US troops in evacuating the city until the last convoy was ready to leave Taejon . As the last convoy of troops moved out of the city and fought through a North Korean roadblock , Dean , with a small force of soldiers , followed them . At the edge of the city , the final elements of the 34th Infantry , leaving the city in 50 vehicles , were ambushed and many of their vehicles were destroyed by machine guns and mortars , forcing the Americans to retreat on foot . In the ensuing fight , Dean 's jeep made a wrong turn and was separated from the rest of the American forces . 
 Dean 's small force eventually made it out of the city past several North Korean roadblocks . Just outside the city Dean stopped his jeep to tend to several wounded US soldiers in a wrecked truck in the ditch . However , as they attempted to escape further they ran into another North Korean roadblock and were forced to continue on foot , crossing the Taejon River and climbing a nearby mountain . In the confusion , Dean was separated from the group . 
 While he was going after water for a wounded man , Dean fell down a steep slope and was knocked unconscious . When he regained consciousness he found he had a gashed head , a broken shoulder , and many bruises . For 36 days , Dean wandered alone in the mountains trying to reach safety , going without food and medical treatment . The 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) tall Dean who had weighed 210 pounds ( 95 kg ) before the war was reduced to 130 pounds ( 59 kg ) as he wandered for the next month . On August 25 , two South Koreans who pretended to be guiding him toward safety led him into a prearranged ambush of North Korean soldiers at <unk> , 35 miles ( 56 km ) south of Taejon and 65 miles ( 105 km ) west of Taegu . Dean attempted to fight the North Koreans with his sidearm to make them kill him , but they easily took the weakened Dean prisoner . 
 By July 22 , with Dean still missing , Eighth Army appointed Church commander of the 24th Infantry Division and promoted him to major general . Dean was widely believed to have been killed until October 1950 , when US forces captured a North Korean soldier named Lee Kyu Hyun near P 'yongyang . Lee had been assigned to live with Dean for a month as an interpreter . Lee was interviewed throughout late 1950 but US military leaders still generally thought Dean was dead . 
 = = = = Imprisonment = = = = 
 Dean was taken to a local police headquarters and kept in a cage overnight . North Korean troops were initially not aware of his identity . Dean was taken to a prison camp in Suwon where he was given food and medical treatment , but he began suffering from diarrhea and dysentery . Dean was then transported to the main North Korean prisoner of war camp in Seoul with other American prisoners . He attempted to keep his identity a secret but he was quickly recognized by a South Korean administrator who had worked under him before the war . Dean was moved to P 'yongyang and given a larger living quarters in an underground North Korean facility . He remained sick owing to poorly prepared food . 
 As UN air raids against the North Koreans intensified , Dean was moved to Sunan , north of P 'yongyang , to a hut where he lived with several guards . They began daily interrogations primarily aimed at forcing military intelligence from him or making him sign a written condemnation of the UN intervention in Korea , but Dean adamantly refused to do so . Senior North Korean military leaders continued such interrogations through October 1950 but eventually gave up when Dean would not cooperate and was not intimidated by their threats . Dean continued to suffer from illness related to poor food but he was not given another interpreter and was not interrogated after October 1950 . North Korean leaders had threatened to harm Dean if he did not cooperate but he was never actually tortured . Dean took to playing chess with his guards often and he was allowed to exercise daily . He was kept alone , however , and was never with other American prisoners for the remainder of his confinement . Dean later wrote extensively of his capture and imprisonment in his 1973 autobiography , General Dean 's Story . He claimed the North Koreans considered him a war criminal and had many discussions with him about the problems with capitalism in the United States . 
 Dean later said he had tried to commit suicide because he feared he would break under torture and divulge critical intelligence to the North Koreans . He had been aware of the plans for Operation Chromite , and feared he would reveal the information to the North Koreans under torture . Still he remained defiant during interrogations , refusing to divulge any information and acting unafraid , sometimes laughing off threats . He was given better treatment than most UN prisoners in North Korea , as he was regularly fed and rarely subjected to interrogations after his initial capture . He tried several times to escape but failed in doing so . He may have been moved to <unk> when the UN forces took P 'yongyang , and returned when the Chinese People 's Liberation Army entered the war and forced the UN forces back . 
 Dean had no contact with the outside world until he was interviewed on December 18 , 1951 , by an Australian journalist , Wilfred Burchett , who was a correspondent for Le Soir , a Belgian newspaper . Burchett 's interview was the first time Dean was definitively confirmed alive and as a prisoner to the rest of the world . Dean recounted the incident in his autobiography with the title , " My friend Wilfred Burchett . " From Burchett 's visit to the end of the war , Dean claimed in his autobiography he was visited by numerous news correspondents . He claimed to have lived the remainder of his time as a prisoner in relative comfort . After the July 27 , 1953 Armistice Agreement , Dean remained in North Korea as a prisoner of war for several more weeks while the armistice was worked out . He was returned to the UN forces at Panmunjom during Operation Big Switch on September 4 , 1953 .

 When Dean returned to the United States , he received a hero 's welcome and was presented with a number of decorations , including the Medal of Honor , which he was unaware he had been awarded . Dean maintained he did not think his own experience was particularly heroic , and asserted he did not feel he deserved an award for his actions in Korea . He was given a ticker @-@ tape parade in New York City on his return to the US on October 26 , 1953 , and he was made the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade on January 1 , 1954 . 
 Three months after his return from Korea , Dean was assigned as the Deputy Commanding General of the Sixth United States Army at the Presidio of San Francisco in California . Dean held this post for two years until he retired from active duty on October 31 , 1955 . Upon retirement Dean was awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge for his front line service in World War II and Korea . 
 Dean lived a quiet life in Berkeley , California , after retirement . He died on August 24 , 1981 , at the age of 82 and was buried in San Francisco National Cemetery in the Presidio of San Francisco , next to his wife .

 Dean met Mildred Dern of Salt Lake City , Utah when one of Dern 's friends was injured in a fall from one of Dean 's polo ponies during his 1923 – 1926 tour at Fort Douglas . The two were married in 1926 . The couple had two children , Majorie June Dean , born in 1927 and William Dean , Jr . , born 1929 . June married Robert Williams , a US Army Captain , while William Jr. attended West Point Academy in 1950 . Dean maintained an athletic lifestyle for much of his life , picking up weightlifting and running when he was young , coaching basketball and , in his later years , he played tennis . He maintained a steady athletic regimen for the majority of his life , even insisting upon it during his imprisonment . 
 In his later life , Dean maintained a self @-@ deprecating outlook on his actions in Korea , and maintained he did not feel he deserved the Medal of Honor . Of his time in Korea , Dean later said , " I wouldn 't have awarded myself a wooden star for what I did as a commander . " In his autobiography , he opted instead to highlight the command decisions he regretted making and contend , " There were heroes in Korea , but I was not one of them . "

 Maj. Gen. Dean distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the repeated risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty . In command of a unit suddenly relieved from occupation duties in Japan and as yet untried in combat , faced with a ruthless and determined enemy , highly trained and overwhelmingly superior in numbers , he felt it his duty to take action which to a man of his military experience and knowledge was clearly apt to result in his death . He personally and alone attacked an enemy tank while armed only with a hand grenade . He also directed the fire of his tanks from an exposed position with neither cover nor concealment while under observed artillery and small @-@ arms fire . When the town of Taejon was finally overrun he refused to insure his own safety by leaving with the leading elements but remained behind organizing his retreating forces , directing stragglers , and was last seen assisting the wounded to a place of safety . These actions indicate that Maj. Gen. Dean felt it necessary to sustain the courage and resolution of his troops by examples of excessive gallantry committed always at the threatened portions of his frontlines . The magnificent response of his unit to this willing and cheerful sacrifice , made with full knowledge of its certain cost , is history . The success of this phase of the campaign is in large measure due to Maj. Gen. Dean 's heroic leadership , courageous and loyal devotion to his men , and his complete disregard for personal safety .

 Dean was the highest ranking UN prisoner of war of the Korean War . He was also the highest ranking Medal of Honor recipient . His story of capture and imprisonment by the North Koreans was recorded by numerous publications . His initial capture was covered by Life Magazine in July 1950 with a photo essay detailing his life . In December 1951 , when he was discovered to be alive , TIME Magazine did an article on his story and imprisonment , featuring an image of him on the magazine 's front cover . He subsequently received more attention from the press . Multiple media outlets attempted to interview Dean but the North Koreans rarely allowed it . Few photos and little information on his status was released , mostly that which showed him in good condition . After his release , Dean 's story , as well as Lee 's , was told in Life Magazine . 
 Dean was memorialized in several ways for his actions . The T @-@ 34 tank Dean knocked out remained where it was destroyed in Taejon until 1977 as a memorial to the fight . In his hometown of Carlyle , a newly renovated bridge was named the General Dean Suspension Bridge in 1953 . It was inducted into the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 . After Dean 's death , his uniform and personal items were donated to the University of California at Berkeley ROTC program . The ROTC created a memorial for Dean in the Hearst Gym on campus , designating Room 155 " The Dean Room . " Dean 's uniform and medals , including his Medal of Honor , have been housed there . The university 's Cal Alumni Association also selected Dean as their 1953 " Alumnus of the Year . "
