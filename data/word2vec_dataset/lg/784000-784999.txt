 Hochuli was hired by the NFL in 1990 as a back judge ( now field judge ) after applying to the league before the 1989 NFL season . His first game in the league was on August 11 , 1990 , at Lambeau Field in Green Bay , Wisconsin . During his first two years in the league , he was assigned to the officiating crew headed by referee Howard Roe . To gain additional experience as a back judge and eventually a referee , Hochuli participated in the NFL 's partnership with the World League of American Football ( WLAF ) , a spring developmental league , in 1991 and 1992 . Using his experience in the WLAF , as well as the organization , precision , and analytical skills he learned while working under Roe 's guidance , Hochuli desired to become a crew chief in the NFL . He was promoted to referee in 1992 when longtime referee Stan Kemp was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig 's Disease and forced to retire . Hochuli had worked a pre @-@ season game that year in Tokyo , Japan , as a back judge when he received a telephone call following the game from then @-@ Senior Director of Officiating , Jerry Seeman . Seeman asked Hochuli to work as referee for the first time when the Denver Broncos hosted the Cincinnati Bengals in a pre @-@ season game . 
 Since becoming a referee , Hochuli headed the officiating crews for Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXVIII , and he was selected as an alternate for Super Bowl XXXI , Super Bowl XXXVII , and Super Bowl XXXIX . In addition to working two Super Bowls , he has officiated five conference championship games as of the start of the 2007 NFL season . Every officiating game performance is graded by the league each week . These grades determine which officials are assigned playoff games , as well as the Super Bowl . Hochuli credits his mentor , Jerry Markbreit , a four @-@ time Super Bowl referee , as the greatest influence on his career .

 Hochuli has served as the head of the NFL Referees Association , the union which represents NFL game officials . The union was responsible for negotiating a new contract for the officials prior to the 2001 NFL season . At the time , salaries ranged from a first @-@ year official earning US $ 1 @,@ 431 a game to a veteran official with twenty years of experience making $ 4 @,@ 330 a game . Officials were looking for a 400 percent increase in salary while the league was offering just 40 percent . During the negotiations , Hochuli believed the issue in finding a resolution was to convince the league that officials are full @-@ time employees . 
 At the start of the season , officials had rejected a league offer of a 60 percent immediate increase in salary , followed by an 85 percent salary increase in 2002 , and a 100 percent increase in 2003 . For the first time in league history , replacement officials were used during the regular season . Hochuli had distributed an e @-@ mail to 1 @,@ 200 potential replacement officials warning them that " Working as a scab will actually hurt and likely kill any chances you would have of ever getting into the NFL . " He later regretted sending the letter to college football officials across the United States . The stalemate between the union and the league ended on September 19 , 2001 , when officials agreed to a six @-@ year deal from the league with an immediate increase in salary of 50 percent with a raise each year . Officials had been locked out since the final week of pre @-@ season games that year and returned to work on September 23 , 2001 , when the league resumed games following the September 11 , 2001 attacks .

 Hochuli has worked memorable games throughout his career . In his second year as referee , he worked the 1993 Thanksgiving Day game between the Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins in Irving , Texas . During the final moments of the game , Miami placekicker Pete <unk> had a field goal attempt blocked . The Cowboys ' Leon Lett inadvertently touched the loose ball before the Dolphins ' Jeff <unk> pounced on it . At the time , Hochuli had " no idea " what happened during the play and had to confer with three other officials to piece together the sequence of events . With the information gathered from the officials , he ruled that Miami retained possession of the football . <unk> booted the ensuing winning field goal for the Miami win . 
 Hochuli was referee for 1995 's meeting between the Cowboys and the Eagles at Veteran 's Stadium ; the game saw the Cowboys try a 4th down conversion on their own 30 @-@ yard line ; the play was stopped but Hochuli blew the play dead saying the two @-@ minute warning had hit ; replay , though , indicated the play got off before the whistle blew . The Cowboys got another shot , tried another 4th down conversion , and it was stopped again . The Eagles kicked the winning field goal for the 20 @-@ 17 win . 
 Hochuli was referee for a November 1998 Monday Night Football meeting between the New England Patriots and the Miami Dolphins . A last @-@ second pass from Dan Marino was caught at midfield ; Jimmy Johnson claimed one second was left on the game clock but Hochuli ruled the clock had expired and the game was thus over . 
 Hochuli was referee for the 1999 AFC Divisional Playoff between the Miami Dolphins and Jacksonville Jaguars ; it was the final game in the careers of Dan Marino and Jimmy Johnson as the Jaguars won 62 @-@ 7 . 
 Hochuli was referee in the 2003 Divisional Playoffs between the Packers and the Eagles . 
 On October 2 , 2005 , he officiated the first regular @-@ season NFL game played outside the United States when the Arizona Cardinals played the San Francisco 49ers in Mexico City , Mexico as part of the league 's " Fútbol Americano " marketing campaign . On the first penalty announcement of the game , Hochuli gave the explanation in Spanish to pay respect to the host city and country . 
 Hochuli officiated the first regular season game at University of Phoenix Stadium on September 10 , 2006 , when the Cardinals hosted the 49ers . 
 He was the referee for the game between the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers , played December 17 , 2006 , that included Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre becoming the all @-@ time leader for pass completions among quarterbacks in the NFL . Favre was unaware that his 4 @,@ 968 pass completions were a record until he was informed during the game by Hochuli . Hochuli was the referee again for another Favre record @-@ breaking moment when Favre threw his 421st touchdown pass of his career on September 30 , 2007 at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis , Minnesota to break the record previously held by Dan Marino . He also <unk> the Week 17 game in 2008 in which the Lions became the first , and as of today , the only team in the NFL to finish 0 @-@ 16 . 
 One of Hochuli 's notable explanations came during a 2007 regular season game between the San Diego Chargers and New England Patriots . While nullifying a holding infraction , he announced through his microphone , " There was no foul on the play . It was not a hold . The defender was just overpowered . "

 On September 14 , 2008 , Hochuli officiated a now @-@ infamous game between the San Diego Chargers and the Denver Broncos , which became notable for a highly controversial call near the end of regulation play . The call came with 1 : 17 left in the game , while Denver was in possession of the ball at the San Diego one @-@ yard line , trailing the Chargers by seven points . On a second @-@ down play , Denver quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled the ball , and it was recovered by San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins . Ed Hochuli blew his whistle during the play , signaling that the play was dead and ruling an incomplete pass . Hochuli admitted his mistake and spotted the ball at the point of the fumble , but could not award possession to San Diego , and the play was not reviewable under then @-@ current instant replay rules . Chargers head coach Norv Turner later said after the game , " Ed came over to me and said he blew it . And that to me is not acceptable . " Hochuli responded to the situation , writing , " Affecting the outcome of a game is a devastating feeling . Officials strive for perfection – I failed miserably . " Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was even fined $ 25 @,@ 000 for publicly criticizing Hochuli . The NFL passed a rule the following offseason allowing such plays to be reviewable under the instant replay rule for the 2009 NFL season . Speaking to Referee in November 2009 , Hochuli told the magazine , " It was really an easy play . I ’ ve thought many times why I did what I did . The best explanation is it was almost like dyslexia . I realized it was a fumble and did the wrong thing . I realized I was wrong but there was nothing I could do about it . " 
 = = Celebrity = = 
 Hochuli 's presence on the football field has created a cult following . His rise in popularity is believed to have been started by Phil Simms , a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS , who made reference to the size of Hochuli 's arms during a telecast . On the Internet , websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist . He is often affectionately referred to as " <unk> " , a combination of his last name and " Hercules " , in homage to his large biceps . While he is aware of his celebrity status , Hochuli does not understand it . He said in a USA Today interview , " I get a kick out of the notoriety , because I 'm just a referee . I 'm not the players . The players are the game . They 're what this is all about . I get notoriety because I explain things , and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique , which is funny because I 'm a shrimp , a peewee compared to those players . Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I 'm a good referee . " His recognition extends to the streets , in airports , and in the courtroom . He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association ( NBA ) player Charles Barkley at the airport . " It never ceases to amaze me , " Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star . " The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me . " He appreciates the attention , saying , " I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee . I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that . Like anybody , I like praise . Probably because of my personality , I thrive on that more than other people . " 
 Hochuli 's career as an NFL official has been chronicled on the NFL Network 's Six Days to Sunday in 2005 . The half @-@ hour television program detailed the game preparations that Hochuli goes through from Monday to Saturday during the season . This preparation work includes fifteen hours of video tape game review , a " couple hours " completing administrative tasks for the NFL , reading the rulebook , taking a weekly written exam on rules , and communicating with league supervisors .

 = Worship Music ( album ) = 
 Worship Music is the tenth studio album by American thrash metal band Anthrax . The album was released on September 12 , 2011 internationally , and on September 13 in the United States . It was the band 's first album of original material since We 've Come for You All ( 2003 ) , the first full @-@ length Anthrax album since 1990 's Persistence of Time to feature vocalist Joey Belladonna , and the final album with guitarist Rob Caggiano prior to his departure in January 2013 . 
 The album 's creation was a lengthy process , with work beginning as early as November 2008 . The album was delayed due to issues with the departure of vocalist Dan Nelson , and the re @-@ joining of John Bush who ultimately decided not to commit to the album . The band eventually reunited with Belladonna , and finished recording in April 2011 . Worship Music was positively received upon release , with critics describing it as " fresh and eruptive as ever " and qualified it as a return to form for the band . The record debuted at number 12 in the United States , their highest chart position since Sound of White Noise ( 1993 ) .

 In the December 2008 edition of his monthly <unk> column , Food Coma , guitarist Scott Ian revealed that he had been in the studio working on the new Anthrax album since November 4 . Ian went on to say that drums , bass , and rhythm guitar had been arranged for 19 tracks , and that the process of recording the vocals had begun . " We should be mixing at the end of January and soon after that giving birth to a really pissed off , loud , fast and heavy child . " In a subsequent May 2009 Food Coma column , Ian announced that the album was being mixed by Dave Fortman , whose previous credits include albums by Evanescence and Slipknot . 
 The album was initially scheduled to feature Dan Nelson on vocals . However , following the events later that year , he was no longer a member of the band . When asked what would happen to the completed studio album featuring Nelson 's vocals , Ian said : " Until we have a new singer , I can 't tell you what will happen to the record . We 'll probably change a few things on it , including the vocals . " Ian also indicated that the album 's release could be delayed until 2010 . It was assumed that John Bush was going to record new vocals for the album after his reunion with the band . However , this did not happen . In an interview at the time , Bush said he was trying to re @-@ record vocals for some of the songs that had already been recorded . 
 Bush eventually decided that he did not want to recommit to Anthrax full @-@ time and left the group . As a result , the band reunited with Joey Belladonna . Following shows during the summer and fall of 2010 , the band returned to the studio . Some of the completed songs were left as is , adding Belladonna 's vocals , others were re – written , and some entirely new songs were composed with Belladonna . Drummer Charlie Benante suggested the album 's title after the eponymous TV show . Although Ian stated that the album name could be changed , this turned out not to be the case . In October 2010 at Nassau Coliseum , Anthrax performed the song " Fight ' Em ' Til You Can 't " for the first time . It was at this point that Ian said fans should expect the new record in late 2011 . 
 In December , Ian stated that the band had almost completed the new album and only had to re @-@ record two or three tracks . Ian further confirmed that all the material would feature vocals by Belladonna . Noisecreep reported that Worship Music had been shelved until Belladonna completed new vocal tracks . The band finished recording Worship Music in April 2011 , and called it their " most emotional album " . " Fight ' Em ' Til You Can 't " was released as the lead single on June 24 , 2011 . It was released for free download as a way of saying " thank you " to fans ' loyalty in waiting in anticipation for the album . Three days later , Ian announced that the band had started the mastering process for the upcoming album . The cover art was revealed the following month . 
 = = Lyrics = = 
 The songs " Earth on Hell " and " Revolution Screams " refer to democracy in the United States and around the world . According to Ian , at the time of the album 's release , these songs were " very much about people taking the power back " . Although the songs were written long before , he cited the 2011 Egyptian revolution and Occupy Wall Street demonstrations as examples of this phenomenon coming to pass . " The Devil You Know " , despite the line " Let the right one in " and the band 's history of using horror stories as subject matter , was not a reference to the 2004 Swedish vampire novel Let the Right One In ; it was about World War II veterans . " Fight ' Em ' Til You Can 't " is about a zombie apocalypse , and " In the End " was written as a tribute to the late Ronnie James Dio , an inspiration for the band , and Dimebag Darrell , a friend and collaborator on three Anthrax albums . " Judas Priest " was named as a tribute to the heavy metal band Judas Priest , and contains a bridge that references several well @-@ known Priest songs . " The Constant " is about the episode of the 2004 television series Lost of the same name , where a character travels through time until he finds his " constant " . 
 " I 'm Alive " was written when Dan Nelson was member of the band . Anthrax premiered the song live in 2008 , though it was titled " Vampires " at that time . It is notable for its tribal @-@ sounding introduction with clean guitars backed up by a marching drum beat , before taking off into a heavy riff and gradually breaking into a melodic chorus . In an album preview by Blabbermouth.net , " I 'm Alive " was described as " beautiful and grand with a build that demands audience participation " . The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best Hard Rock / Metal Performance , the band 's fourth Grammy nomination .

 = = Reception = = 
 Critical reception of the album was generally positive . AllMusic 's Greg Prato noted that in spite of the issues surrounding the departure of Dan Nelson , the album fits together " seamlessly " and called it the group 's finest studio recording since Persistence of Time ( 1990 ) . Jason Heller of The A.V. Club praised the album for being rid of the " <unk> @-@ metal stench " of the previous record and the " all @-@ around patchiness " from the other John Bush @-@ era albums . Heller noted that it brought the band back into the " youthful dynamic " . Classic Rock journalist Malcolm Dome observed that musically , Worship Music is a mixture of " the grinding power " of We 've Come for You All and the more " clear @-@ cut melodic approach " of Among The Living ( 1987 ) , resulting in an album that is " violently metallic yet sophisticated " . 
 Michael Christopher of The Boston Phoenix commented that Anthrax has learned from its past mistakes in making the album . He observed that the humor that characterized the previous albums was still present , and called this album a " fresh fistful of metal " . Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times compared Worship Music to Metallica 's Lulu , saying that Anthrax , unlike Metallica , opted to " reclaim ground " dominated by younger bands . Mark Fisher , writing in Metal Forces , highlighted the guitar performance , saying it reminded him of the sound Anthrax is mostly associated with . Although Fisher preferred the albums with John Bush on vocals , he remarked that Worship Music is a fine recording with a career @-@ defining performance by Joey Belladonna . Chad Bowar from About.com also praised Belladonna 's performance , noting that the vocal delivery was filled with angst and emotion . He opined that Anthrax sounded rejuvenated and qualified the album as a return to form . 
 Chad Grischow of IGN commented that the album sounded " as fresh and eruptive as ever " with the exception of " Crawl " , the " rare misstep on the otherwise fantastic album " . Loudwire 's Matthew Wilkening said that Belladonna 's 20 @-@ year absence from the band hasn 't affected the band 's chemistry at all . According to him , the album represented the maturity and musical growth of the band . PopMatters 's Chris Colgan described the music as a combination of the " later material with shades of their thrash beginnings " . He believes this wasn 't " the glorious comeback " for Anthrax , but called it a solid album with signs of progress for the group . Metal Rules chose Worship Music the best metal album of 2011 .

 Anthrax spent the following two years touring in support of Worship Music . The band started the tour with the " big four " shows alongside Metallica , Slayer , and Megadeth , which took place in the summer of 2011 .

Ian was able to make an appearance in Milan , Italy , joining the band and Kisser for half of the setlist . Anthrax continued touring in late 2011 . In October and November , Anthrax embarked on a 23 date US tour co @-@ headlining with Testament and openers Death Angel . These three bands resumed performing together in early 2012 .

 The T48 57 mm Gun Motor Carriage was a self @-@ propelled anti @-@ tank gun produced by the Diamond T company in 1943 for the United States . The design incorporated a 57 mm gun M1 , a US production of the British Ordnance QF 6 pounder , mounted on an M3 Half @-@ track . 
 A total of 962 vehicles were produced from 1942 to 1943 .

Additionally , the purpose @-@ built M10 tank destroyer , armed with a 3 @-@ inch gun ( and later a 17 @-@ pounder gun in British service ) had begun to enter production . As a result , the British transferred 650 half @-@ tracks to the Soviet Union under the Soviet Aid Program . Britain retained 30 and the remainder were taken by the US ; these British and American vehicles were converted back to standard M3 Half @-@ tracks , except for one kept by the U.S. Army .

It had a crew of five ( commander , gunner , driver , loader , and radio operator ) . 
 = = Development = = 
 The T48 originated from an Anglo @-@ American requirement for a self @-@ propelled 6 @-@ pounder anti @-@ tank gun . The requirement was met by emplacing a 57 mm gun M1 – the U.S. production version of the British Ordnance QF 6 @-@ pounder – in the rear of an M3 Half @-@ track . The first production batch was ordered in April 1942 . The Americans dropped their requirements because of the design of another tank destroyer , the M10 . Afterwards it was intended solely to be supplied overseas under the terms of the Lend @-@ Lease Program ; the T48 was never officially type @-@ classified . 
 = = = Pilot model = = = 
 The pilot model was built at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in May 1942 . The 57 mm Gun M1 was mounted in the M12 recoil mechanism and installed on a tubular pedestal . The tubular pedestal was soon replaced with a conical structure that was designated the " 57 mm gun mount T5 " . The gun on the pilot model had a traverse of 27 @.@ 5 degrees either side of the centerline ( total of 55 degrees ) , while having an elevation of + 15 to -5 degrees . The short @-@ barrelled ( 43 caliber ) British Mark III 6 @-@ pounder gun was installed in the pilot , but the longer @-@ barrelled ( 50 caliber ) 57 mm Gun M1 was specified for the production models . The original travel lock – to hold the gun in a fixed position when the vehicle was moving – proved to be unsatisfactory , and was replaced by a travel lock on the front hood . 
 The original design used a gun shield taken from the T44 57 mm Gun Motor Carriage , but after the first tests were complete , a new shield was designed with 5 / 8 inch thick face @-@ hardened steel on the front and 1 / 4 inch thick on the sides and top . The shield extended over the crew with a relatively low silhouette of only 90 in ( 2 @.@ 3 m ) . Experience with the M3 Gun Motor Carriage in the Philippines Campaign , resulted in demountable headlights being used . The T48 was accepted for production in 1942 . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Deliveries of the T48 were made in 1942 and 1943 , with 50 arriving in 1942 followed by a further 912 in 1943 . The British ordered all of the T48s that were produced , intending to use them in the Western Desert Campaign . By the time the vehicles arrived in the theater in the summer of 1943 , the British had already won the war in the Western Desert . Meanwhile , the 57 mm gun was superseded by the 75 mm gun from the U.S. , and later the availability of the Ordnance QF 17 @-@ pounder gun , meant that the T48 became surplus to British requirements . As a result , the vehicles were almost immediately shipped to the Soviet Union under the terms of the Soviet Aid Program . Through this , the Soviets received 650 vehicles , which they designated the " SU @-@ 57 " ( <unk> <unk> 57 ) . A small number were later passed to the Polish People 's Army . 
 Of the remainder , Britain accepted 30 , all of which were converted back into carriers , and the US took 282 vehicles . Of those retained by the US , all but one were converted back to M3A1 standard carriers in 1944 . The conversion took place at the Chester Tank Depot . The Wehrmacht also operated a number of T48s as carriers , having captured several from Britain and the Soviet Union . 
 The Soviets employed the T48 along the Eastern Front , mainly in Operation Bagration . The Soviet 16th Separate Tank Destroyer Brigade used a large number of T48s in 1943 during the offensive across the Dnieper River , and with the 19th Brigade during the <unk> bridgehead battle in August 1944 . The T48 also served with the Soviet 22nd Self @-@ Propelled Artillery Brigade . Some of these units also took part in the Berlin and Prague offensives . The Polish People 's Army used T48s assigned to the 7th Self @-@ Propelled Artillery Battery to support Soviet attacks into Germany and Poland . 
 In Soviet service , the vehicles were allocated to brigades at a scale of 60 per brigade . During the attack , the vehicles were used to provide mobile fire support , being placed behind the infantry , usually in a hull @-@ down position behind a ridge or a hill , to fire across a broad front to take advantage of the long range of the 57 mm gun .

 = Irish phonology = 
 The phonology of the Irish language varies from dialect to dialect ; there is no standard pronunciation of Irish . Therefore , this article focuses on phenomena that pertain generally to most or all dialects , and on the major differences among the dialects . Detailed discussion of the dialects can be found in the specific articles : Ulster Irish , Connacht Irish , and Munster Irish . 
 Irish phonology has been studied as a discipline since the late 19th century , with numerous researchers publishing descriptive accounts of dialects from all regions where the language is spoken . More recently , Irish phonology has been the focus of theoretical linguists , who have produced a number of books , articles , and doctoral theses on the topic . 
 One of the most important aspects of Irish phonology is that almost all consonants come in pairs , with one having a " broad " pronunciation and the other a " slender " one . Broad consonants are velarized , that is , the back of the tongue is pulled back and slightly up in the direction of the soft palate while the consonant is being articulated . Slender consonants are palatalized , which means the tongue is pushed up toward the hard palate during the articulation . The contrast between broad and slender consonants is crucial in Irish , because the meaning of a word can change if a broad consonant is substituted for a slender consonant or vice versa . For example , the only difference in pronunciation between the words <unk> ( ' cow ' ) and beo ( ' alive ' ) is that <unk> is pronounced with a broad b sound , while beo is pronounced with a slender b sound . The contrast between broad and slender consonants plays a critical role not only in distinguishing the individual consonants themselves , but also in the pronunciation of the surrounding vowels , in the determination of which consonants can stand next to which other consonants , and in the behavior of words that begin with a vowel . This broad / slender distinction is similar to the hard / soft one of several Slavic languages , like Russian . 
 The Irish language shares a number of phonological characteristics with its nearest linguistic relatives , Scottish Gaelic and Manx , as well as with Hiberno @-@ English , the language with which it is most closely in contact . 
 = = History of the discipline = = 
 Until the end of the nineteenth century , linguistic discussions of Irish focused either on the traditional grammar of the language ( issues like the inflection of nouns , verbs and adjectives ) or on the historical development of sounds from Proto @-@ Indo @-@ European through Proto @-@ Celtic to Old Irish . The first descriptive analysis of the phonology of an Irish dialect was Finck ( 1899 ) , which was based on the author 's fieldwork in the Aran Islands . This was followed by <unk> ( 1906 ) , a phonetic description of the dialect of <unk> near <unk> , County Donegal . Pedersen ( 1909 ) is predominantly a historical account , but has some description of modern dialects as well . Alf Sommerfelt published early descriptions of both Ulster and Munster varieties ( Sommerfelt 1922 and Sommerfelt 1965 for the village of Torr in <unk> , Sommerfelt 1927 for Munster , and Sommerfelt 1929 for the now extinct dialect of South Armagh ) . The dialect of <unk> on the Dingle Peninsula was described by <unk> ( 1931 ) . From 1944 to 1968 the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies published a series of monographs , each describing the phonology of one local dialect : Ó Cuív ( 1944 ) for West Muskerry in County Cork ( <unk> , <unk> and vicinity ) , de <unk> ( 1966 ) ( first published 1945 ) for Cois <unk> in County Galway ( Barna , <unk> , <unk> and vicinity ) , Breatnach ( 1947 ) for An Rinn , County Waterford , de <unk> ( 1958 ) for Tourmakeady in County Mayo , Wagner ( 1959 ) for Teelin , County Donegal , <unk> an <unk> ( 1968 ) for Erris in County Mayo . More recent descriptive phonology has been published by Lucas ( 1979 ) for <unk> in northern Donegal , Hughes ( 1986 ) for <unk> and <unk> ( also near <unk> ) , Ó <unk> ( 1996 ) for <unk> <unk> in Connemara ( <unk> and vicinity ) , and Ó Sé ( 2000 ) for the Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry . 
 Research into the theoretical phonology of Irish began with Ó Siadhail & Wigger ( 1975 ) , which follows the principles and practices of The Sound Pattern of English and which formed the basis of the phonology sections of Ó Siadhail ( 1989 ) . Dissertations examining Irish phonology from a theoretical point of view include Ní Chiosáin ( 1991 ) , Green ( 1997 ) in optimality theory , and <unk> ( 1997 ) and Bloch @-@ <unk> ( 1998 ) in government phonology . 
 = = Consonants = = 
 Most dialects of Irish contain at a minimum the consonant phonemes shown in the following chart ( see International Phonetic Alphabet for an explanation of the symbols ) . The consonant / h / is neither broad nor slender . 
 = = = <unk> and <unk> = = = 
 Broad ( velar or velarized ) consonants have a noticeable velar offglide ( a very short vowel @-@ like sound ) before front vowels , which sounds like the English w but made without rounding the lips . The IPA symbol for this sound is [ <unk> ] . Thus <unk> / n ̪ <unk> / ( ' nine ' ) and <unk> / <unk> / ( ' way , manner ' ) are pronounced [ n ̪ <unk> ] and [ <unk> ] , respectively . This velar offglide is labialized ( pronounced with lip @-@ rounding , like w ) after labial consonants , so <unk> / <unk> / ( ' yellow ' ) is pronounced [ <unk> ] . 
 Similarly , slender ( palatal or palatalized ) consonants have a palatal offglide ( like English y ) before back vowels , e.g. <unk> / <unk> / ( ' thick ' ) is pronounced [ <unk> ] . 
 When a broad consonant follows a front vowel , there is a very short vowel sound [ ə ̯ ] ( called an <unk> ) just before the consonant , e.g. <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠ / ( ' sell ' ) is pronounced [ <unk> ̯ l ̪ ˠ ] . Similarly , when a slender consonant follows a back vowel , there is an <unk> [ i ̯ ] before the consonant , e.g. <unk> / <unk> / ( ' place ' ) is pronounced [ <unk> ̯ tʲ ] , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' drinking ' gen . ) is pronounced [ <unk> ̯ lʲ ] , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' understanding ' ) is [ <unk> ̯ ɾʲ ] , and <unk> / d ̪ ˠuːn ̠ ʲ / ( ' to us ' ) is [ d ̪ <unk> ̯ n ̠ ʲ ] . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 / w / ( which can be written as 〈 bh 〉 , 〈 <unk> 〉 , or 〈 v 〉 ) has two basic allophones : the <unk> approximant [ w ] and the velarized voiced labiodental fricative [ vˠ ] . The distribution of these allophones varies from dialect to dialect . In Munster , generally only [ vˠ ] is found , and in Ulster generally only [ w ] is found . In Connacht , [ w ] is found word @-@ initially before vowels ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ] ' is ' ) and [ vˠ ] in other positions ( e.g. <unk> [ n ̪ <unk> ] ' saint ' , <unk> [ <unk> ] ' autumn ' , and <unk> [ <unk> ̪ ˠə ] ' hurried ' ) . 
 The remaining labial fricatives are typically labiodental [ <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ] , but they as well as the fricative allophone [ vˠ ] of / w / have bilabial allophones [ <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ] in many dialects ; the distribution depends partly on environment ( <unk> are more likely to be found adjacent to rounded vowels ) and partly on the individual speaker . 
 Among the coronals , most are alveolar , but the broad stops and lateral are typically dental [ t ̪ ˠ , d ̪ ˠ , n ̪ ˠ , l ̪ ˠ ] , and the slender coronal fricative is typically <unk> [ ʃ ] . The slender coronal stops / tʲ , <unk> / may be realized as alveolo @-@ palatal affricates [ <unk> , <unk> ] in a number of dialects , including Tourmakeady , Erris , and Teelin . 
 The slender dorsal stops / c , ɟ , ɲ / may be articulated as true <unk> [ c , ɟ , ɲ ] or as <unk> [ k ̟ , ɡ <unk> , ŋ <unk> ] . 
 The phoneme / j / has three allophones in most dialects : a palatal approximant [ j ] before vowels besides / iː / and at the ends of syllables ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ] ' nice ' , <unk> [ <unk> ] ' will be ' ) ; a voiced ( post ) palatal fricative [ ʝ ] before consonants ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̪ ˠ ] ' sun ' ) ; and an intermediate sound [ j ˔ ] ( with more <unk> than [ j ] but less <unk> than [ ʝ ] ) before / iː / ( e.g. <unk> [ j ˔ <unk> ] ' straightened ' ) . 
 As in English , voiceless stops are aspirated ( articulated with a puff of air immediately upon release ) at the start of a word , while voiced stops may be incompletely voiced but are never aspirated . Voiceless stops are unaspirated after / sˠ / and / ʃ / ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ] 1 ' terror ' ) ; however , stops remain aspirated after the clitic is / sˠ / ( e.g. is cam [ <unk> ] ' it 's crooked ' ) . Several researchers ( e.g. Ó Cuív 1944 , Wagner 1959 , de <unk> 1966 , <unk> an <unk> 1968 , and Ó Sé 2000 ) use transcriptions like / <unk> sd <unk> <unk> / , etc . , indicating they consider the stops that occur after voiceless fricatives to be devoiced allophones of the voiced stops rather than unaspirated allophones of the voiceless stops ( as is actually the case in Scottish Gaelic ) , but this is a minority view . 
 = = = Fortis and lenis sonorants = = = 
 In Old Irish , the sonorants ( those spelled 〈 l n r m 〉 ) were divided not only into broad and slender types , but also into fortis and lenis types . The precise phonetic definition of these terms is somewhat vague , but the coronal fortis sounds ( those spelled 〈 l n r 〉 ) were probably longer in duration and may have had a larger area of contact between the tongue and the roof of the mouth than the lenis sounds . Fortis m was probably a normal [ m ] , while lenis m was a nasalized semivowel [ w ̃ ] , perhaps tending towards a nasalized fricative [ <unk> ] or [ β ̃ ] when palatalized . By convention , the fortis coronals are transcribed with capital letters 〈 L N R 〉 , the lenis with lower case 〈 l n r 〉 ( some authors , such as <unk> 2006 , instead use Latin 〈 l n r m 〉 for fortis and Greek 〈 λ ν ρ μ 〉 for lenis ) . Thus Old Irish had four rhotic phonemes / <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> / , four lateral phonemes / <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , lʲ / , and four coronal nasal phonemes / <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , nʲ / . Fortis and lenis sonorants contrasted with each other between vowels and word @-@ finally after vowels in Old Irish , for example <unk> / <unk> / ( ' he shears ' ) vs. <unk> / <unk> / ( ' he may carry ' ) ; <unk> / <unk> / ( ' hazel ' ) vs. col / <unk> / ( ' sin ' ) ; <unk> / <unk> / ( ' stake ' ) vs. son / <unk> / ( ' sound ' ) . Word @-@ initially , only the fortis sounds were found , but they became lenis in environments where <unk> triggered lenition was found : <unk> / <unk> / ( ' mystery ' ) vs. a <unk> / a <unk> / ( ' his mystery ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' provision ' ) vs. a <unk> / a <unk> / ( ' his provision ' ) . 
 In the modern language , the four rhotics have been reduced to two in all dialects , / <unk> , <unk> , <unk> / having merged as / ɾˠ / . For the laterals and nasals , some dialects have kept all four distinct , while others have reduced them to three or two distinct phonemes , as summarized in the following table . 
 As for fortis and lenis m , in time the lenis version ( nasalized semivowel or labial fricative ) came to be pronounced as a regular semivowel or fricative along with nasalization of the preceding vowel . The later loss of / w / between vowels has resulted in phonemically nasalized vowels in some modern dialects ( see below ) , but these are not robustly maintained in any dialect ; the strong tendency is to eliminate the nasalization entirely . The original nasalized semivowel is still reflected as 〈 <unk> 〉 in the spelling , however . 
 = = Vowels = = 
 The vowel sounds vary from dialect to dialect , but in general Connacht and Munster at least agree in having the monophthongs / iː / , / ɪ / , / uː / , / ʊ / , / eː / , / ɛ / , / oː / , / ɔ / , / a / , / aː / , and schwa ( / ə / ) , which is found only in unstressed syllables ; and the falling diphthongs / əi / , / əu / , / <unk> / , and / <unk> / . 
 The vowels of Ulster Irish are more divergent and are not discussed in this article . 
 = = = Vowel backness = = = 
 The backness of vowels ( that is , the horizontal position of the highest point of the tongue ) depends to a great extent on the quality ( broad or slender ) of adjacent consonants . Some researchers ( e.g. Ó Siadhail & Wigger 1975 : 80 – 82 , Ó Siadhail 1989 : 35 – 37 , Ní Chiosáin 1994 ) have argued that [ ɪ ] and [ ʊ ] are actually allophones of the same phoneme , as are [ ɛ ] and [ ɔ ] , as in a vertical vowel system . Under this view , these phonemes are not marked at an abstract level as either front vowels or back vowels . Rather , they acquire a specification for <unk> or backness from the consonants around them . In this article , however , the more traditional assumption that / ɪ , ʊ , ɛ , ɔ / are four distinct phonemes will be followed . The descriptions of the allophones in this section come from Ó Sé ( 2000 : 20 – 24 ) ; the pronunciations therefore reflect the Munster accent of the Dingle Peninsula . Unless otherwise noted , however , they largely hold for other Munster and Connacht accents as well . 
 = = = = Close vowels = = = = 
 The four close vowel phonemes of Irish are the fully close / iː / and / uː / , and the near @-@ close / ɪ / and / ʊ / . Their exact pronunciation depends on the quality of the surrounding consonants . / iː / is realized as a front [ iː ] between two slender consonants ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ] ' country ' ) . Between a slender and a broad consonant , the tongue is retracted slightly from this position ( for which the IPA symbol is [ i ̠ ː ] ) , e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̠ <unk> ̪ ˠ ] ( ' sale ' ) , <unk> [ ki ̠ <unk> ] ( ' berry ' gen . ) . Between two broad consonants , the tongue is retracted even further , almost to the point of being a central vowel ( in IPA , [ <unk> ] ) : <unk> [ <unk> ] ( ' sheep ' ) . / uː / is a fully back [ uː ] between broad consonants ( e.g. dún [ d ̪ ˠuːn ̪ ˠ ] ' fort ' ) , but between a broad and a slender consonant , the tongue is somewhat advanced ( IPA [ u ̟ ː ] ) , e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̟ <unk> ] ( ' three people ' ) , <unk> [ <unk> ̟ <unk> ] ( ' eye ' ) . Between two slender consonants , it is advanced even further , to a centralized vowel ( IPA [ <unk> ] ) : <unk> [ <unk> ] ( ' quiet ' ) . 
 The near @-@ close vowels / ɪ / and / ʊ / show a similar pattern . / ɪ / is realized between slender consonants as a front [ i ̞ ] , e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̞ ɟ ] ( ' house ' dat . ) . After a slender consonant and before a broad one , it is a near @-@ front [ ɪ ] , e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̪ ˠə ] ( ' piece ' ) . After a broad consonant and before a slender one , it is a more retracted [ ɪ ̈ ] , e.g. <unk> [ ˈt ̪ <unk> ̈ <unk> ̪ ˠ ] ( ' understands ' ) . Finally , between two broad consonants it is a central [ ɨ ̞ ] , e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̞ <unk> ] 2 ( ' salty ' ) . / ʊ / is a near @-@ back [ ʊ ] when all adjacent consonants are broad , e.g. dubh [ d ̪ <unk> ] ( ' black ' ) , and a more centralized [ ʊ ̟ ] after a slender consonant , e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̟ <unk> ̪ ˠ ] ( ' rag ' ) . 
 = = = = Mid vowels = = = = 
 The realization of the long close @-@ mid vowels / eː / and / oː / varies according to the quality of the surrounding consonants . / eː / is a front [ eː ] between two slender consonants ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ] ' yell ' ) , a centralized [ <unk> ] between a broad and a slender consonant ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̪ <unk> ] ' call ' ) , and a more open centralized [ ɛ ̝ ̈ ː ] between two broad consonants ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̝ ̈ <unk> ̪ ˠ ] ' danger ' ) . / oː / ranges from a back [ oː ] between two broad consonants ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̪ ˠ ] ' turf ' ) to an advanced [ o ̟ ː ] between a broad and a slender consonant ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̟ <unk> ] ' turf ' [ gen . ] ) to a centralized [ <unk> ] between two slender consonants ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ] ' music ' [ gen . ] ) . 
 The short open @-@ mid vowels also vary depending on their environment . Short / ɛ / ranges from a front [ ɛ ̝ ] between slender consonants ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̝ ɟ ] ' will be ' ) to a retracted [ ɛ ̝ ̈ ] between a broad and a slender consonant ( e.g. bead [ <unk> ̝ ̈ d ̪ ˠ ] ' I will be ' , <unk> [ <unk> ̝ ̈ <unk> ] ' was ' ) to a central [ <unk> ̞ ] when the only adjacent consonant is broad ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̞ ] ' cross ' [ dat . ] ) . Short / ɔ / between two broad consonants is usually a back [ ɔ ̝ ] , e.g. <unk> [ kl ̪ <unk> ̝ x ] ( ' stone ' ) , but it is a centralized [ ö ] adjacent to nasal consonants and labial consonants , e.g. <unk> [ ən ̪ <unk> ̪ ˠ ] ( ' there ' ) and bog [ <unk> ] ( ' soft ' ) . Between a broad and a slender consonant , it is a more open [ ɔ ̝ ̈ ] : <unk> [ <unk> ̝ ̈ lʲ ] ( ' school ' ) , <unk> [ <unk> ̝ ̈ x ] ( ' drink ' ) . 
 <unk> / ə / is realized as a near @-@ close , near @-@ front [ ɪ ] when adjacent to a palatal consonant , e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ] ( ' pike ' ) . Next to other slender consonants , it is a mid @-@ centralized [ ɪ ̽ ] , e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̽ ] ( ' salt water ' ) . Adjacent to broad consonants , it is usually a mid central [ ə ] , e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̪ <unk> ] ( ' information ' ) , but when the preceding syllable contains one of the close back vowels / uː , ʊ / , it is realized as a mid @-@ centralized back [ ʊ ̽ ] , e.g. <unk> [ ˈd ̪ ˠuːn ̪ <unk> ̽ ] ( ' closing ' ) , <unk> [ <unk> ̽ ] ( ' pigs ' ) . 
 = = = = Open vowels = = = = 
 The realization of the open vowels varies according to the quality of the surrounding consonants ; there is a significant difference between Munster dialects and Connacht dialects as well . In Munster , long / aː / and short / a / have approximately the same range of realization : both vowels are relatively back in contact with broad consonants and relatively front in contact with slender consonants . Specifically , long / aː / in word @-@ initial position and after broad consonants is a back [ ɑː ] , e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ] ( ' place ' ) , <unk> [ t ̪ <unk> ] ( ' beach ' ) . Between a slender and a broad consonant , it is a retracted front [ a ̠ ː ] , e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̠ <unk> ] ( ' will cut ' ) , while between two slender consonants it is a fully front [ aː ] , e.g. a <unk> [ ə <unk> ] ( ' John ' <unk> . ) . In Dingle , the back allophone is rounded to [ ɒː ] after broad labials , e.g. bán [ <unk> ̪ ˠ ] ( ' white ' ) , while in An Rinn , rounded [ ɒː ] is the usual realization of / aː / in all contexts except between slender consonants , where it is a centralized [ ɒ ̈ ː ] . Short / a / between two slender consonants is a front [ a ] , as in <unk> [ <unk> ] 3 ( ' short ' ) . Between a broad and a slender consonant , it is in most cases a retracted [ a ̠ ] , e.g. fear [ <unk> ̠ ɾˠ ] ( ' man ' ) , <unk> and [ <unk> ̠ <unk> ] ( ' worn ' ) , but after broad labials and / l ̪ ˠ / it is a centralized front [ ä ] , e.g. baile [ <unk> ] ( ' town ' ) , <unk> [ l ̪ <unk> ] 4 ( ' injure ' ) . When it is adjacent only to broad consonants , it is a centralized back [ ɑ ̈ ] , e.g. mac [ <unk> ̈ k ] ( ' son ' ) , <unk> [ ɑ ̈ <unk> ] ( ' say ' ) . 
 In Connacht varieties , the allophones of short / a / are consistently further front than the allophones of long / aː / . In Erris , for example , short / a / ranges from a near @-@ open front vowel [ æ ] before slender consonants ( e.g. sail [ <unk> ] ' earwax ' ) to an open [ a ] after slender consonants ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ] ' bright ' ) to a centralized back [ ɑ ̈ ] between broad consonants ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̈ <unk> ̪ ˠ ] ' horse ' ) . Long / aː / , on the other hand , ranges from a back [ ɑː ] between broad consonants ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̪ ˠ ] ' boat ' ) to an advanced back [ ɑ ̟ ː ] before slender consonants ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̟ <unk> ] ' to get ' ) to a centralized back [ ɑ ̈ ː ] after slender consonants ( e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̈ ː ] ' fine ' ) . In Tourmakeady , the back allophone is rounded to [ ɒː ] after broad labials , e.g. bán [ <unk> ̪ ˠ ] ( ' white ' ) . In Connemara , the allophones of / a / are lengthened in duration , so that only vowel quality distinguishes the allophones of / a / from those of / aː / .

 The starting point of / əi / ranges from a near @-@ open central [ ɐ ] after broad consonants to an open @-@ mid centralized front [ ɛ ̈ ] after slender consonants , and its end point ranges from a near @-@ close near @-@ front [ ɪ ] before slender consonants to a centralized [ ɪ ̈ ] before broad consonants . Examples include <unk> [ kl ̪ <unk> ] ( ' rogue ' ) , <unk> [ <unk> ̈ ɾˠ ] ( ' dog ' ) , cill [ <unk> ̈ <unk> ] ( ' church ' ) , and <unk> [ <unk> ̈ ɪ ̈ sˠ ] ( ' cure ' ) .

In West Muskerry and the Dingle Peninsula , however , the starting point of / əu / is rounded and further back after broad consonants , e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ] ( ' goat ' ) . 
 The starting point of / <unk> / ranges from a close front [ i ] after slender consonants to a retracted [ i ̠ ] after word @-@ initial broad / ɾˠ / ( the only context in which it appears after a broad consonant ) . Its end point ranges from a mid central [ ə ] before broad consonants to a close @-@ mid centralized front [ <unk> ] before slender consonants . Examples include <unk> [ <unk> ̪ ˠ ] ( ' sense ' ) , <unk> [ <unk> ̠ <unk> ] ( ' ever ' ) , and <unk> [ <unk> ] ( ' devils ' ) . 
 The starting point of / <unk> / is consistently a close back [ u ] while the end point ranges from [ ɐ ] to [ ɪ ̽ ] : <unk> [ <unk> ] ( ' above ' ) , <unk> [ <unk> ̪ ˠ ] ( ' lamb ' ) , <unk> [ <unk> ̽ lʲ ] ( ' strike ' ) . 
 = = = <unk> vowels = = = 
 In general , vowels in Irish are nasalized when adjacent to nasal consonants . For some speakers , there are reported to be minimal pairs between nasal vowels and oral vowels , indicating that nasal vowels are also separate phonemes ; these generally result from an earlier nasalized semivowel [ w ̃ ] ( historically the lenited version of / m / ) , that has since been lost . However , the contrast is not robust in any dialect ; most published descriptions say that <unk> nasal vowels are present in the speech of only some ( usually older ) speakers . Potential minimal pairs include those shown in the table below . 
 In addition , where a vowel is nasalized because it is adjacent to a nasal consonant , it often retains its nasalization in related forms where the consonant is no longer nasal . For example , the nasal / m / of <unk> [ <unk> ] ( ' mother ' ) is replaced by <unk> / w / in the phrase a <unk> [ ə <unk> ] ( ' his mother ' ) , but the vowel remains nasalized . Similarly , in sneachta [ <unk> ̪ ˠə ] ( ' snow ' ) the vowel after the / nʲ / is nasalized , while in an <unk> [ ə <unk> ̪ ˠə ] ( ' the snow ' gen . ) , the / nʲ / is replaced by / ɾʲ / in some northern dialects , but the nasalized vowel remains . 
 = = Phonotactics = = 
 The most interesting aspects of Irish phonotactics revolve around the behavior of consonant clusters . Here it is important to distinguish between clusters that occur at the beginnings of words and those that occur after vowels , although there is overlap between the two groups . 
 = = = Word @-@ initial consonant clusters = = = 
 Irish words can begin with clusters of two or three consonants . In general , all the consonants in a cluster agree in their quality , i.e. either all are broad or all are slender . Two @-@ consonant clusters consist of an obstruent consonant followed by a liquid or nasal consonant ( however , labial obstruents may not be followed by a nasal ) ; examples ( from Ní Chiosáin 1999 ) include <unk> / <unk> / ( ' milking ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' fine ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ <unk> / ( ' button ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' law ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠaː / ( ' usual ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' idiot ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' slice ' ) , sneachta / <unk> ̪ ˠə / ( ' snow ' ) , <unk> / t ̪ <unk> ̪ ˠuː / ( ' poker ' ) , and <unk> / t ̪ <unk> ̪ ˠuː / ( ' long for ' ) . In addition , / sˠ / and / ʃ / may be followed by a voiceless stop , as in <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠ / ( ' purse ' ) and <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠ / ( ' story ' ) . Further , the cluster / <unk> ̪ ˠ / occurs in the word <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠaː / ( ' women ' ) and a few forms related to it . Three @-@ consonant clusters consist of / sˠ / or / ʃ / plus a voiceless stop plus a liquid . Examples include <unk> / <unk> / ( ' rumpus ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠ / ( ' scream ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ <unk> / ( ' flash ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' fun ' ) , and <unk> / <unk> / ( ' streak ' ) . 
 One exception to quality agreement is that broad / sˠ / is found before slender labials ( and for some speakers in Connemara and Dingle before / c / as well ) . Examples include : <unk> / <unk> / ( ' berries ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' scythe ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' dependent ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' inspire ' ) , and <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠ / ~ / <unk> ̪ ˠ / ( ' story ' ) . 
 In the environment of an initial consonant mutation , there is a much wider range of possible onset clusters ; for example , in a lenition environment the following occur : <unk> / <unk> ̪ <unk> / ( ' tasted ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' broke ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠ / ( ' practiced ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' bent ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' stuck ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' acted ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠə / ( ' slipped ' ) , <unk> / hn ̪ <unk> / ( ' swam ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' reached ' ) . In an <unk> environment , the following are found : <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠaː / ( ' flower ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠə / ( ' years ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' you would break ' ) , <unk> / n ̪ <unk> ̪ ˠuː / ( ' warp ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ <unk> ̪ ˠ / ( ' bridge ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' ladder ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' you would dress ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠaː / ( ' you would leave ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' you would act ' ) . 
 In Donegal , Mayo , and Connemara dialects ( but not usually on the Aran Islands ) , the coronal nasals / <unk> , nʲ / can follow only / sˠ , ʃ / respectively in a word @-@ initial cluster . After other consonants , they are replaced by / ɾˠ , ɾʲ / : <unk> / <unk> / ( ' hill ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' women ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' liking ' ) , <unk> / t ̪ <unk> / ( ' long for ' ) . 
 Under lenition , / <unk> ̪ ˠ , <unk> / become / hn ̪ ˠ , <unk> / as expected in these dialects , but after the definite article an they become / t ̪ <unk> , <unk> / : sneachta / <unk> ̪ ˠə / ( ' snow ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠə / ( ' snow ' [ lenited form ] ) , an <unk> / ə <unk> ̪ ˠə / ( ' the snow ' gen . ) . 
 = = = Post @-@ vocalic consonant clusters and epenthesis = = = 
 Like word @-@ initial consonant clusters , post @-@ vocalic consonant clusters usually agree in broad or slender quality . The only exception here is that broad / ɾˠ / , not slender / ɾʲ / , appears before the slender coronals / tʲ , <unk> , ʃ , nʲ , lʲ / : <unk> / <unk> / ( ' two people ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' trade ' ) , <unk> / ˈd ̪ <unk> / ( ' doors ' ) , <unk> / d ̪ <unk> / ( ' handle ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' advice ' ) . 
 A cluster of / ɾˠ , ɾʲ / , / l ̪ ˠ , lʲ / , or / n ̪ ˠ , nʲ / followed by a labial or dorsal consonant ( except the voiceless stops / <unk> , pʲ / , / k , c / ) is broken up by an epenthetic vowel / ə / : <unk> / <unk> / ( ' abrupt ' ) , gorm / <unk> / ( ' blue ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠ / ( ' mistake ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' certain ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' service ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' anger ' ) , <unk> / ˈd ̪ <unk> / ( ' dark ' ) , <unk> / ˈd ̪ <unk> ̪ <unk> / ( ' bold ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ <unk> / ( ' dove ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' pleasant ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ <unk> ̪ ˠ / ( ' sparrow ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' venom ' ) , <unk> , / <unk> ̪ <unk> / ( a name for Ireland ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' name ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ <unk> / ( ' mind ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' animal ' ) . 
 There is no epenthesis , however , if the vowel preceding the cluster is long or a diphthong : <unk> / <unk> / ( ' wrinkle ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' term ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' insight ' ) , <unk> / ˈd ̪ <unk> ̪ <unk> / ( ' duty ' ) . There is also no epenthesis into words that are at least three syllables long : <unk> / <unk> / ( ' firmament ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ <unk> ̪ <unk> ̪ ˠ / ( ' throat ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠ / ( ' dandelion ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' Carmelite ' ) . 
 = = Phonological processes = = 
 = = = Vowel @-@ initial words = = = 
 Vowel @-@ initial words in Irish exhibit behavior that has led linguists to suggest that the vowel sound they begin with on the surface is not actually the first sound in the word at a more abstract level . Specifically , when a clitic ending in a consonant precedes a word beginning with the vowel , the consonant of the clitic surfaces as either broad or slender , depending on the specific word in question . For example , the n of the definite article an ( ' the ' ) is slender before the word <unk> ( ' wonder ' ) but broad before the word <unk> ( ' age ' ) : an <unk> / <unk> <unk> ̪ ˠt ̪ <unk> / ( ' the wonder ' gen . ) vs. an <unk> / ən ̪ ˠ <unk> / ( ' the age ' ) . 
 One analysis of these facts is that vowel @-@ initial words actually begin , at an abstract level of representation , with a kind of " empty " consonant that consists of nothing except the information " broad " or " slender " . Another analysis is that vowel @-@ initial words , again at an abstract level , all begin with one of two <unk> , one triggering palatalization and the other triggering velarization of a preceding consonant . 
 = = = <unk> before fortis sonorants = = = 
 Where reflexes of the Old Irish fortis sonorants appear in syllable @-@ final position ( in some cases , only in word @-@ final position ) , they trigger a lengthening or diphthongization of the preceding vowel in most dialects of Irish . The details vary from dialect to dialect . 
 In Donegal and Mayo , lengthening is found only before rd , <unk> , rn , before rr ( except when a vowel follows ) , and in a few words also before word @-@ final ll , for example , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' top ' ) , ard / <unk> ̪ ˠ / ( ' tall ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ <unk> / ( ' inch ' ) , <unk> / ˈt ̪ <unk> ̠ ʲə / ( ' spinning wheel ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠ / ( ' yonder ' ) . 
 In Connemara , the Aran Islands , and Munster , lengthening is found generally not only in the environments listed above , but also before nn ( unless a vowel follows ) and before m and ng at the end of a word . For example , the word poll ( ' hole ' ) is pronounced / <unk> ̪ ˠ / in all of these regions , while <unk> ( ' grip ' ) is pronounced / <unk> / in Connemara and Aran and / <unk> / in Munster . 
 Because vowels behave differently before broad sonorants than before slender ones in many cases , and because there is generally no lengthening ( except by analogy ) when the sonorants are followed by a vowel , there is a variety of vowel alternations between different related word @-@ forms . For example , in Dingle ceann ( ' head ' ) is pronounced / <unk> ̪ ˠ / with a diphthong , but <unk> ( the genitive singular of the same word ) is pronounced / <unk> / with a long vowel , while <unk> ( the plural , meaning ' heads ' ) is pronounced / <unk> ̪ ˠə / with a short vowel . 
 This lengthening has received a number of different explanations within the context of theoretical phonology . All accounts agree that some property of the fortis sonorant is being transferred to the preceding vowel , but the details about what property that is vary from researcher to researcher . Ó Siadhail & Wigger ( 1975 : 89 – 90 ) argue that the fortis sonorant is tense ( a term only vaguely defined phonetically ) and that this tenseness is transferred to the vowel , where it is realized phonetically as vowel length and / or diphthongization . Ní Chiosáin ( 1991 : 188 – 95 ) argues that the triggering consonant is <unk> associated with a unit of syllable weight called a mora ; this mora then shifts to the vowel , creating a long vowel or a diphthong . Carnie ( 2002 ) expands on that analysis to argue that the fortis sonorants have an advanced tongue root ( that is , the bottom of the tongue is pushed upward during articulation of the consonant ) and that diphthongization is an articulatory effect of this tongue movement . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Where a voiced obstruent or / w / comes into contact with / h / , the / h / is absorbed into the other sound , which then becomes voiceless ( in the case of / w / , <unk> is to / <unk> / ) . <unk> is found most prominently in the future of first conjugation verbs ( where the / h / sound is represented by the letter f ) and in the formation of verbal adjectives ( where the sound is spelled th ) . For example , the verb <unk> / <unk> / ( ' sweep ' ) ends in the voiced consonant / <unk> / , but its future tense <unk> / <unk> / ( ' will sweep ' ) and verbal adjective <unk> / <unk> / ( ' swept ' ) have the voiceless consonant / <unk> / . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Irish exhibits a number of external sandhi effects , i.e. phonological changes across word boundaries , particularly in rapid speech . The most common type of sandhi in Irish is assimilation , which means that a sound changes its pronunciation in order to become more similar to an adjacent sound . One type of assimilation in Irish is found when a coronal consonant ( one of d , l , n , r , s , t ) changes from being broad to being slender before a word that begins with a slender coronal consonant , or from being slender to being broad before a word that begins with a broad coronal consonant . For example , <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠ / ( ' deceive ' ) ends with a broad ll , but in the phrase d <unk> sé <unk> [ <unk> ̠ ʲ <unk> <unk> ] ( ' it deceived me ' ) , the ll has become slender because the following word , sé , starts with a slender coronal consonant . 
 The consonant n may also assimilate to the place of articulation of a following consonant , becoming labial before a labial consonant , palatal before a palatal consonant , and velar before a velar consonant . For example , the nn of ceann / can ̪ ˠ / ( ' one ' ) becomes [ <unk> ] in ceann <unk> [ <unk> <unk> ] ( ' a lame one ' ) and [ ŋ ] in ceann <unk> [ <unk> <unk> ] ( ' a <unk> one ' ) . A voiced consonant at the end of a word may become voiceless when the next word begins with a voiceless consonant , as in <unk> sé [ l ̪ <unk> <unk> ] ( ' he bent ' ) , where the b sound of <unk> / l ̪ <unk> / ( ' bent ' ) has become a p sound before the voiceless s of sé . 
 = = Stress = = 
 = = = General facts of stress placement = = = 
 An Irish word normally has only one stressed syllable , namely the first syllable of the word . In IPA transcription , a stressed syllable is marked with the symbol [ ˈ ] to the left of the syllable . Examples include d <unk> / <unk> / ( ' left ' [ past tense of leave ] ) and <unk> / <unk> ̪ <unk> / ( ' dishonor ' ) . However , certain words , especially adverbs and loanwords , have stress on a noninitial syllable , e.g. <unk> / <unk> / ( ' only ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' tobacco ' ) . 
 In most compound words , primary stress falls on the first member and a secondary stress ( marked with [ <unk> ] ) falls on the second member , e.g. <unk> / <unk> ̪ <unk> ̪ <unk> / ( ' spent bog ' ) . Some compounds , however , have primary stress on both the first and the second member , e.g. <unk> / <unk> / ( ' a terrible lie ' ) . 
 In Munster , stress is attracted to a long vowel or diphthong in the second or third syllable of a word , e.g. cailín / <unk> / ( ' girl ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' request ' ) . In the now @-@ extinct accent of East Mayo , stress was attracted to a long vowel or diphthong in the same way as in Munster ; in addition , stress was attracted to a short vowel before word @-@ final ll , m , or nn when that word was also final in its utterance . For example , <unk> ( ' horse ' ) was pronounced [ <unk> ̪ ˠ ] in isolation or as the last word of a sentence , but as [ <unk> ̪ ˠ ] in the middle of a sentence . 
 = = = The nature of unstressed vowels = = = 
 In general , short vowels are all reduced to schwa ( [ ə ] ) in unstressed syllables , but there are some exceptions . In Munster , if the third syllable of a word is stressed and the preceding two syllables are short , the first of the two unstressed syllables is not reduced to schwa ; instead it receives a secondary stress , e.g. <unk> / <unk> ̪ <unk> ̪ <unk> / ( ' scythe @-@ man ' ) . Also in Munster , an unstressed short vowel is not reduced to schwa if the following syllable contains a stressed / iː / or / uː / , e.g. <unk> / <unk> ̪ <unk> / ( ' art ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' gather ' ) . In Ulster , long vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened but are not reduced to schwa , e.g. cailín / <unk> / ( ' girl ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' gallon ' ) . 
 = = Processes relating to / x / = = 
 The voiceless velar fricative / x / , spelled 〈 ch 〉 , is associated with some unusual patterns in many dialects of Irish . For one thing , its presence after the vowel / a / triggers behavior atypical of short vowels ; for another , / x / and its slender counterpart / ç / interchange with the voiceless glottal fricative / h / in a variety of ways , and can sometimes be deleted altogether . 
 = = = Behavior of / ax / = = = 
 In Munster , stress is attracted to / a / in the second syllable of a word if it is followed by / x / , provided the first syllable ( and third syllable , if there is one ) contains a short vowel ( Ó Cuív 1944 : 66 ) . Examples include <unk> / <unk> / ( ' lame ' ) and <unk> / <unk> / ( ' chips ' ) . However , if the first or third syllable contains a long vowel or diphthong , stress is attracted to that syllable instead , and the / a / before / x / is reduced to / ə / as normal , e.g. <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠ / ( ' listen ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ̪ <unk> ̪ ˠ / 5 ( ' <unk> ' ) . 
 In Ulster , unstressed / a / before / x / is not reduced to schwa , e.g. <unk> / <unk> ̪ <unk> / ( ' cattle ' ) . 
 = = = Interaction of / x / and / ç / with / h / = = = 
 In many dialects of Irish , the voiceless dorsal fricatives / x / and / ç / alternate with / h / under a variety of circumstances . For example , as the lenition of / tʲ / and / ʃ / , / h / is replaced by / ç / before back vowels , e.g. <unk> / <unk> ̠ ʲ / 6 ( ' I would give ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' drove ' ) . In Munster , / ç / becomes / h / after a vowel , e.g. <unk> / <unk> / ( ' twenty ' ) . In Ring , / h / becomes / x / at the end of a monosyllabic word , e.g. <unk> / <unk> / ( ' fear ' ) . In some Ulster dialects , such as that of Tory Island , / x / can be replaced by / h / , e.g. cha / ha / ( ' not ' ) , and can even be deleted word @-@ finally , as in <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠt ̪ <unk> ~ <unk> ̪ ˠt ̪ <unk> / ( ' greedy ' ) In other Ulster dialects , / x / can be deleted before / t ̪ ˠ / as well , e.g. <unk> / <unk> ̪ ˠ / ( ' seven ' ) .

 = = Comparison with other languages = = 
 = = = Scottish Gaelic and Manx = = = 
 Many of the phonological processes found in Irish are found also in its nearest relatives , Scottish Gaelic and Manx . For example , both languages contrast " broad " and " slender " consonants , but only at the coronal and dorsal places of articulation ; both Scottish Gaelic and Manx have lost the distinction in labial consonants . The change of / kn ̪ ˠ <unk> ̪ ˠ mn ̪ ˠ / etc. to / <unk> <unk> <unk> / etc. is found in Manx and in most Scottish dialects . Evidence from written manuscripts suggests it had begun in Scottish Gaelic as early as the sixteenth century and was well established in both Scottish Gaelic and Manx by the late 17th to early 18th century . <unk> or diphthongization of vowels before fortis sonorants is also found in both languages . The stress pattern of Scottish Gaelic is the same as that in Connacht and Ulster Irish , while in Manx , stress is attracted to long vowels and diphthongs in noninitial syllables , but under more restricted conditions than in Munster . 
 Manx and many dialects of Scottish Gaelic share with Ulster Irish the property of not reducing unstressed / a / to / ə / before / x / . 
 = = = Hiberno @-@ English = = = 
 Irish pronunciation has had a significant influence on the features of Hiberno @-@ English . For example , most of the vowels of Hiberno @-@ English ( with the exception of / <unk> / ) correspond to vowel phones ( which may or may not be phonemes ) of Irish . The Irish stops [ t ̪ ˠ d ̪ ˠ ] have been taken over ( though without distinctive velarization ) into Hiberno @-@ English as common realizations of the English phonemes / θ ð / . Hiberno @-@ English also allows / h / to appear in positions where it is permitted in Irish but excluded in other dialects of English , such as before an unstressed vowel ( e.g. Haughey / <unk> / ) and at the end of a word ( e.g. McGrath / <unk> / ) . Another feature of Hiberno @-@ English pronunciation taken from Irish is epenthesis in words like film [ <unk> ] and form [ <unk> ] . 
 = Kiliaen van Rensselaer ( merchant ) = 
 Kiliaen van Rensselaer ( Dutch : [ <unk> vɑn <unk> ] ; 1586 , Hasselt , Overijssel – buried 7 October 1643 , Amsterdam ) was a Dutch diamond and pearl merchant from Amsterdam who was one of the founders and directors of the Dutch West India Company , being instrumental in the establishment of New Netherland . 
 He was one of the first patroons , but the only one to become successful . He founded the Manor of Rensselaerswyck in what is now mainly New York 's Capital District . His estate remained throughout the Dutch and British colonial era and the American Revolution as a legal entity until the 1840s . Eventually , that came to an end during the Anti @-@ Rent War . 
 Kiliaen van Rensselaer was born in the province of Overijssel to Hendrick <unk> van Rensselaer , a soldier from <unk> in the States army of the duke of Upper Saxony , and Maria <unk> , descendant of a well @-@ known printers ' dynasty . To keep from risking his life in the army like his father , he apprenticed under his uncle , a successful Amsterdam jeweler . He too became a successful jeweler and was one of the first subscribers to the Dutch West India Company upon its conception . 
 The concept of patroonships may have been Kiliaen van Rensselaer 's ; he was likely the leading proponent of the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions , the document that established the patroon system . His patroonship became the most successful to exist , making full use of his business tactics and advantages , such as his connection to the Director of New Netherland , his confidantes at the West India Company , and his extended family members who were eager to emigrate to a better place to farm . Van Rensselaer married twice and had at least eleven children . When he died sometime after 1642 , two succeeded him as patroons of Rensselaerswyck . 
 Van Rensselaer had a marked effect on the history of the United States . The American van <unk> all descend from Kiliaen 's son Jeremias and the subsequent Van Rensselaer family is noted for being a very powerful and wealthy influence in the history of New York and the Northeastern United States , producing multiple State Legislators , Congressmen , and two Lieutenant Governors in New York . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Kiliaen van Rensselaer was born in Hasselt , Overijssel , Netherlands in 1586 . The exact day of his birth is unknown . He was the son of Hendrick van Rensselaer and Maria <unk> . His father was a captain in the Dutch army until his death at the Siege of Ostend in early June 1602 . 
 With his father usually not home ( and eventually meeting his death ) because of a military career , van Rensselaer 's mother sent him to apprentice with his uncle , Wolfert van Bijler , a jeweler and diamond merchant . At the time , the gem trade was a prosperous enterprise to join , being a well @-@ developed craft . In those days , the diamond trade was nearly always combined with the trade in pearls , other articles of luxury , and rarities of every description . Dutch jewelers found a ready market for their valuable wares at the Dutch imperial court and the smaller German courts . This realm of work promoted van Rensselaer to a life of economic success . 
 Much of van Rensselaer 's early life is unknown to today 's historians , though in March 1608 it has been recorded that he was taking care of some business of van Bijler in Prague . It seems van Bijler gradually retired from his business , leaving it in the control of van Rensselaer . During his tenure at the helm of his uncle 's business , van Rensselaer proposed a merger with the firm of Jan van Wely , son of one of van Bijler 's sisters , who had an equally successful jewelry business . The firms combined under the name of Jan van Wely & Co. in February 1614 . Van Rensselaer 's name was not included in the name of the new company , since he contributed only one eighth of the investment capital , whereas van Wely contributed half ( 192 @,@ 000 guilders ) . In 1616 , van Wely was called on by Prince Maurice to meet at the Hague for a sale in jewels . He was murdered while waiting to meet with the Prince . The firm 's contract stipulated that at the death of Jan van Wely , the remaining members of the firm should continue the partnership for another six years . Van Wely 's murder , therefore , caused no change in the business , but it seems that at the expiration of that time , van Rensselaer began again on his own account , founding Kiliaen van Rensselaer & Co. with partner Jacques I 'Hermite . 
 = = Director of the Dutch West India Company = = 
 Some of van Rensselaer 's success as a jewel merchant came about due to trade made possible by the Dutch East India Company . The practical spirit of the Dutch merchant could not fail to recognize that the way to riches was through trade with the West Indies and Africa . During the Twelve Years ' Truce , Dutch merchants had sailed unmolested to the West Indies but also received no letters of marque to take prizes from the enemy . 
 Before the Eighty Years ' War began , people realized that the West Indies trade might bring great prosperity to the country and that more power might be developed against Spain . Rather than travel to the area singly on an armed ship or in the company of a few other vessels , traders could do business in the manner of the large and prosperous East India Company . A company for carrying on commerce in the West Indies and Africa could be organized , which might , like the sister company , act as the war @-@ waging power in those parts and be supported by the treasury , ships , and troops of the United Netherlands . 
 After long years of preparation , the Charter of the Dutch West India Company was granted by the States General on June 3 , 1621 , and the subscription list was opened . It is known that subscriptions did not come in very rapidly at first due to the exclusion of the salt trade from the charter . This barrier was overcome in a later amendment to the Charter , and the subscription rate increased . 
 With a capital of seven million florins , the West India Company was granted exclusive authority and trade privileges in the Dutch possessions of the two Americas , as well as the coast of Africa from the Tropic of Cancer to the Cape of Good Hope . The objects of its creation were to establish an efficient and aggressive Atlantic maritime power in the struggle with Spain , as well as to colonize , develop , and rule the Dutch American dependencies — particularly New Netherland ( the modern states of New York and New Jersey ) , discovered by Henry Hudson in 1609 . 
 Van Rensselaer was one of the first subscribers to the West India Company . As with the other subscribers , he contributed 6000 guilders to be a member of one of its chambers . Having paid his way , he was welcomed to the Chamber of Amsterdam , one of five Chambers of the West India Company , each located in a principal Dutch city . The Chamber of Amsterdam was the largest with twenty members , mainly due to the city 's population , and represented four ninths of the management of the West India Company . 
 Due to the practical limitations of meetings with 74 members on a regular basis ( the total number of members from the five Chambers ) , the Charter called for a board of directors comprising nineteen members of the five Chambers . Van Rensselaer was chosen a member of this College of XIX , as it was called . It is said that care was exercised in the selection of the directors of each chamber , and only men of wealth and the highest known integrity were eligible for the trust . Van Rensselaer was apparently known as an unusually clear @-@ headed man and an able and practical merchant who did not limit himself to his own branch of trade . These qualities presumably garnered the trust needed to be elected to the College of XIX . 
 In its role supporting colonization of New Netherland , the West India Company had an executive board of nine members from the College of XIX to manage the concerns of their colony . Van Rensselaer was also a member of this group . In the early career of the Company , van Rensselaer was one of its mainstays , placing several of his vessels at its disposal and twice advancing money to save its credit . His name is conspicuously identified with all its measures of policy , including the original settlement of Manhattan Island , New Amsterdam . 
 = = Patroon = = 
 Unfortunately for the West India Company , the infant colony of New Netherland languished , the cautious Dutch people having very little inclination to emigrate to wild and uncultivated lands in which no substantial inducements were present . While the economic situation of the colony in the late 1620s could be considered a relatively good showing for a colony only newly started in a wilderness , its slow success was hardly sufficient to create much excitement among the directors of the West India Company . Within a few years , the Company realized that special measures which would afford a stimulus to colonization were indispensable . 
 It was for these reasons that the Company proposed the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions , which the States General ratified on June 7 , 1629 . This document was created to encourage settlement of New Netherland through the establishment of feudal patroonships purchased and supplied by members of the West India Company . With a total of 31 articles , the document spells out many requirements of these patroons , primarily stating that each patroon was required to purchase the land from the local Indians , and inhabit the land with 50 adults within four years , with at least one quarter arriving within one year . In return , the patroons were able to own the land and pass it to succeeding generations as a perpetual fiefdom , as well as receive protection and free African slaves from the Company . 
 It is believed that the system of patroonships was originally suggested by van Rensselaer himself . He was reportedly one of the first of the Company to perceive that the building up of New Netherland could not be carried on without labor , and that labor could not be procured without permanent settlers . " Open up the country with agriculture : that must be our first step , " was his urgent advice . The Company was not inclined to involve itself in further expense for colonization , and matters threatened to come to a halt , when someone — very likely van Rensselaer himself — evolved the plan of granting large estates to men willing to pay the cost of settling and operating them . 
 Van Rensselaer was quick to take part in the new endeavor : on January 13 , 1629 , he sent notification to the Directors of the Company that he , in conjunction with fellow Company members Samuel Godyn and Samuel Blommaert , had sent Gillis <unk> and Jacob Jansz <unk> to determine satisfactory locations for settlement . This took place even before the Charter was ratified , but was done in accordance with a draft of the Charter from March 28 , 1628 . 
 The report of the agents sent out had not been unfavorable . They had selected an extensive domain on both sides of the North River in the vicinity of Fort Orange for van Rensselaer , which extended 24 miles ( 39 km ) in length , 40 miles ( 64 km ) in breadth and covered an area of almost 1 @,@ 000 square miles ( 2 @,@ 600 km2 ) . The location relative to the fort was chosen with care — in case of danger , it would be a sure point of defense or retreat , and its garrison would be very likely to intimidate the natives . In this manner van Rensselaer employed the troops of the Company more or less as <unk> to his colonizing plans . Furthermore , the fort would become an easily reached marketplace for the colonists , where they could maintain communication with the outside world . For that reason , van Rensselaer diligently maintained friendly relations with the commander of the garrison and the authorities within the walls . 
 His first act was to obtain possession of the land for his colony from the Mohican , the original owners , who had never been willing to sell their territory — not even the ground of Fort Orange . However , after they had been involved in a bloody war with their neighbors , the Mohawks , and were defeated in 1629 , they were found ready to dispose of their possessions . In April , two officers of the West India Company in Fort Orange , <unk> Jansen Krol and Dirk <unk> <unk> , specially empowered by writing of January 12 , 1630 , purchased a large tract of land on the west side of the North River . Gillis <unk> , one of the men initially sent to determine a settlement location , increased this territory in August by adding tracts of land on the right bank , located above and below Fort Orange , and also by adding land on the east side of the river . After the initial expansion , the territory was later further extended by deeds of purchase in May 1631 and April 1637 . 
 The most troubling aspect of colonizing the patroonships was enlisting the required number of colonists , so that the failure of many of the other proposed patroonships may in part be attributed to this fact . The patroons still dealt with the issues of a cautious people not caring to venture to an undeveloped world . As an owner of extensive lands in the sandy <unk> and of family estates in the not much more fruitful Veluwe , where several relatives were landowners and struggled to subsist on meager means , van Rensselaer had an advantage — his agents needed to employ little persuasion to induce some <unk> and <unk> to migrate to more fruitful regions where the farming would be less difficult . In addition , he could depend on the indirect support of his nephew Wouter van <unk> , who had been appointed Director of New Netherland in 1632 , and with whom he engaged in friendly correspondence at a time when Dutch directors opposed the patroons in every way . In 1634 he collaborated with Michael <unk> Pauw , the patroon of Pavonia on shipping cattle . 
 With that , van Rensselaer shipped out 37 immigrants on his ship <unk> from Amsterdam on September 26 , 1636 . The vessel arrived on April 7 , 1637 . The population rose to more than 100 by 1642 and doubled that in the next ten years . The village of Beverwyck alone had more than 1000 inhabitants by 1660 and is said to have become urban by this point . 
 The good understanding between the patroons of the Amsterdam Chamber left nothing to be desired ; Burgh , Godyn , Blommaert , and van Rensselaer , before signifying to the directors their willingness to start colonies , made an agreement to work the projected colonies on joint account , each under the direction of one of them . Three of them would have a one @-@ fifth share in each colony , while the fourth would receive the remaining two fifths , taking the responsibility for its management and exercising patroon rights . 
 Only Rensselaerswyck was a successful patroonship . Van Rensselaer successively purchased Godyn 's share in the patroonship from his heirs , so that van <unk> soon became the owner of three fifths . The two other shares remained partly in the hands of Blommaert and partly in the hands of others : Adam Bessels owning Blommaert 's fifth , while Johannes de Laet and Toussaint <unk> split Burgh 's fifth between them . 
 Letters saved by the van Rensselaer family show that Kiliaen van Rensselaer never visited his colony in person . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 = = = First marriage = = = 
 Van Rensselaer married his cousin Hillegonda van Bijler , on July 23 , 1616 . As the sole heir of her father Wolfert van Bijler ( or <unk> ) , she inherited 12 @,@ 000 guilders . Hillegonda van Bijler was born around 1598 , making her near the age of 18 at the time of her marriage to van Rensselaer . The same year , the young husband purchased a couple of lots on the east side of the recently dug Keizersgracht in Amsterdam , between Marten and <unk> streets , where he built a house . 
 Van Rensselaer and van Bijler had three children . The first was Hendrick , Kiliaen 's first son , believed to have died in childhood . Johan , their second son , was baptized on September 4 , 1625 . Maria , their last child , was buried on January 4 , 1627 . She died as an infant . 
 Hillegonda van Bijler is presumed to have died in late December 1626 , since she was buried on January 1 , 1627 , three days before her third child Maria . She was around the age of 28 and the couple had been married less than eleven years .

 Van Rensselaer re @-@ married on December 14 , 1627 to Anna van Wely , daughter of van Rensselaer 's former business partner . Van Wely was born around 1601 , making her about 26 at the time of the marriage . The couple had eight children between 1629 and 1639 , four boys and four girls : 
 Van Wely outlived her husband , having died in Amsterdam in 1670 . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Little is known about van Rensselaer 's death , and sources even disagree on the year . Van Rensselaer was interred in the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam . His memorial stone states he was buried in the church on October 7 , 1643 . 
 Van Rensselaer 's son Jeremias is the sole ancestor of the entire van Rensselaer family in America , and only because of Kiliaen 's purchase and development of the land in New Netherland . Included in the subsequent family tree is a very powerful and wealthy group of individuals over the course of American history . Within the paternal ( van Rensselaer ) lineage , the family has produced numerous New York State <unk> and Senators , two Lieutenant Governors of New York , and five Congressmen from New York between 1789 and 1842 . 
 Van Rensselaer is also the source of the names of the town of Rensselaerville , city of Rensselaer , and county of Rensselaer in upstate New York . Additionally , Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy was founded in 1824 by Stephen Van Rensselaer III as the Rensselaer School . It is now a world @-@ renowned technical and engineering school . Notably , at the time of his death , Stephen III was worth about $ 10 million ( about $ 88 billion in 2007 dollars ) and is noted as being the tenth @-@ richest American in history . 
 Rensselaerswyck continued as a legal entity until the mid @-@ 1840s , having survived Dutch and British colonial times , even being given a special patent by Queen Anne to confirm the patroon 's fiefdom upon British takeover of the area . The end of the manor came with the Anti @-@ Rent War , when many tenants rose against the successors of Stephen Van Rensselaer III ( who had died in 1839 ) , having much influence on the Legislature elections of the time , and eventually intimidating the Van Rensselaer family enough to sell off most of its holdings . 
 The family records , many of which were translated and published in the Van Rensselaer <unk> Manuscripts , reveal the personality of the man who figures prominently in the history of colonization as the founder of the only successful patroonship that ever existed in New Netherland . But beyond the fact that he managed this patroonship and that he was a merchant and director of the West India Company , practically nothing was known until the organization and translation of the family records in the early 1900s ( decade ) .

 The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009 ( Czech : <unk> <unk> v <unk> <unk> Liberec 2009 ) took place 18 February – 1 March 2009 in Liberec , Czech Republic . This was the fourth time these championships were hosted either in the Czech Republic or in Czechoslovakia , having done so at <unk> <unk> ( 1925 ) and Vysoké Tatry ( both in 1935 and 1970 ) . 
 The biggest sports event in the country 's history , it hosted 589 athletes from 61 countries . Women 's ski jumping and Men 's Nordic combined 10 km mass start events debuted at theses championships , both won by Americans Lindsey Van and Todd Lodwick , respectively . Norway won the most medals with twelve and most golds with five , all in the men 's cross @-@ country skiing events , including three from Petter Northug . Germany finished second in the total medal count with nine though none of them were gold ( eight silver and one bronze ) . Finland finished third in the medal count with eight with three golds , all from Aino @-@ <unk> Saarinen in women 's cross @-@ country skiing .

 Besides the debut of women 's ski jumping at these championships , the big winner in the jumping events was Austria with three medals and two each for Wolfgang Loitzl and Gregor Schlierenzauer . Adding the 10 km mass start , the Nordic combined format was changed from 7 @.@ 5 km sprint and 15 km individual Gundersen to 10 km individual large hill ( aka Large hill Gundersen ) and 10 km individual normal hill ( aka Normal hill Gundersen ) , respectively . Estonia 's Andrus <unk> became the oldest gold medalist at 38 when he won gold in the men 's 15 km event . Despite concern over the lack of snowfall that plagued event preparation prior to the championships , the championships themselves had an abundance of snowfall and wind that caused the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined mass start to be postponed for a day and the ski jumping individual large hill competition to be limited to one jump . 
 Attendance was between 180 @,@ 000 and 200 @,@ 000 , twice the number at the previous championships in Sapporo , but 35 to 40 percent lower than the 2005 championships in Oberstdorf . FIS President Gian Franco Kasper commented at the closing ceremonies of the 15 nations earning medals at these championships , along with the successes of the television coverage by Czech TV and the success of the women 's ski jumping at these championships would pave the way for inclusion into the 2014 Winter Olympics . A broadcast report from the European Broadcasting Union released on 4 June 2009 had total viewership of 666 million global viewers , higher than that of the 2005 championships and the 2001 championships .

 The host of the 2009 World championships was awarded at the 2004 FIS Congress in Miami , Florida , USA on 3 June 2004 . The opposing candidate city to Liberec was Oslo , Norway . Norwegian Ski President Sverre Seeberg stated to the Norwegian press before the voting started that he " thought it would be a close call , but not as close for FIS President Kasper to use his deciding vote . " The fact this was the fourth time in a row that Liberec applied for the championships , and that it was almost 40 years since it last was arranged in Eastern Europe ( 1970 in Vysoké Tatry , Czechoslovakia ) might give Liberec an advantage , according to Seeberg . 
 Liberec was selected 11 – 4 over Oslo , and since there were 17 FIS members , Kasper did not vote . Seeberg was ineligible to vote , even though he served in place of the late Jan Jensen . The Oslo committee quickly announced after the loss that they would apply for the 2011 championships , which they got awarded two years later . 
 Prior to being awarded the World championships in 2004 , Liberec had hosted a total of 40 cross country skiing , Nordic combined , and ski jumping competitions though it had not hosted a cross country World Cup event by June 2005 . At a 24 – 25 May 2005 meeting , a report was given by the Liberec committee to the FIS race directors on course inspection , including layout of the courses . On 10 May 2006 , a coordination group meeting was held led by Roman Kumpošt , the first organizing committee chair , regarding venue construction , television production , and construction within Liberec itself in preparation for the championships . A coordination meeting took place in Liberec 18 – 19 April 2007 to discuss venue information and event preparation .

The test event for cross country occurred during the weekend of 15 – 17 February 2008 . Because of warm weather and the lack of snow , the organizing committee was forced to bring snow from the mountains surrounding Liberec . As a result , the races were held on the paved roller skiing track . Initially on 16 February they were scheduled to be pursuit events , but were changed to interval start events . The winner of the 10 km women 's event was Norway 's Astrid Jacobsen while the winner of the 15 km men 's event was Jean Marc Gaillard of France .

 The ski jumping venue took place at Ještěd which has two hills that were already to FIS specifications . The normal hill size ( HS ) was 100 m ( <unk> ) while the large hill size was 134 m ( HS134 ) . Both hills were used for FIS ski jumping World Cup venues with Finnish ski jumper Janne Ahonen holding the record jump of 139 m on the HS134 hill in 2004 . Modifications were done to the outrun and data was gathered on the wind flow within the ski jumping area from January to March for 2006 to 2009 . At the fall 2007 meeting in Zurich during the week of 24 September 2007 , it was announced by the Organizing Committee that construction was proceeding according to schedule , with completion in mid @-@ December 2007 . The test event for <unk> took place on 8 – 9 February 2008 . A grandstand of 10 @,@ 000 spectators was constructed in order to have night time ski jumping the weekend of 9 – 10 February 2008 . The hill suffered a landslide caused by continuous rainfall around the hill during the week of 28 January 2008 , but the outrun was not affected by the event , according to Liberec mayor Jiri <unk> . On 1 February , Neumannová stated that the ski jumping events took place as scheduled . The lift to the ski jump that was not working during the FIS World Cup B Nordic combined event in January was fixed . The winners of the ski jumping test event at the HS134 hill were Thomas Morgenstern of Austria on 8 February and Anders Jacobsen of Norway on 9 February . An <unk> Cup competition took place on the weekend of 20 – 21 December 2008 to have final test procedures and infrastructure for the championships . As of 14 January 2009 , the main grandstand was complete while the teams worked on proper shaping of the hills for use . The large hill was closed while the normal hill was designated for ski jumper and Nordic combined athlete training . Further construction during the week of 19 January 2009 included spectator stairs on the side of the hill , mobile containers for the athletes and their service teams ; and a spectator catering tent was set up .

 The nordic combined events used both venues listed for cross country skiing and ski jumping . The test event for Nordic combined occurred during the weekend of 15 – 17 February 2008 . Because of the lack of snow and warm weather prior to the test event , the schedule for the test event was adjusted to the sprint event on 15 February , the Gundersen event on 16 February , and the sprint qualification event on 17 February . The sprint event on 15 February was cancelled to changing winds . Meanwhile , the Gundersen event on 16 February was changed to a mass start event won by Norway 's Petter <unk> . Two unsuccessful attempts at the ski jumping part of the sprint qualification event to high winds on the 17th resulted in the event 's cancellation . A World Cup event leading up to the championships was to have taken place 13 – 14 December 2008 in the 10 km individual large hill event as a test event , but was cancelled on 6 December 2008 to warm weather and lack of snow . Neumannová stated that they had a second plan in getting snow from the <unk> mountains higher elevations where there were better conditions for snowing . 10 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 350 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of snow at <unk> and <unk> were prepared for two nights . The third plan proposed two large parking places in the Krkonoše Mountains with natural snow collected for use in the Vesec area .

 At the closing ceremonies of the championships , FIS President Kasper expressed great satisfaction with the championships , stating that it was the first time that a nation without any successful national favorites ( The Czech won only one medal , a silver by Bauer in the men 's 15 km ) had organized such a successful championship . According to Kasper , attendance reached between 180 @,@ 000 and 200 @,@ 000 in the 12 days of competition . The lack of snowfall concerns prior to the championships were more than made up for with continuous snowfall though that affected spectators and competitors alike . Praise was given by Kasper both to the venue managers and Czech TV for their efforts in their successful championships . 15 different nations reached the podium at the championships noted Kasper . Kasper also state the success of the women 's ski jumping event will hopefully push the International Olympic Committee to include the event for the 2014 Games in Sochi with a possible team event as well . Concerning the Nordic combined 10 km mass start , Kasper stated that the event will be thoroughly analyzed as part of an overall season assessment as part of the discipline 's current overhaul . Finally , Kasper wished everyone the best and looked forward to seeing everyone at Oslo for the next Nordic World Ski Championships .

 = This Too Shall Pass ( OK Go song ) = 
 " This Too Shall Pass " is an alternative rock song by OK Go from the album Of the Blue Colour of the Sky . The single was released in January 2010 . The band took the unorthodox route of creating two official music videos for the song , both of which premiered on YouTube . The first features a live performance of the song in collaboration with the University of Notre Dame Marching Band . The second features a giant Rube Goldberg machine , constructed to operate in time with the song . The popularity of the second music video of the song has been compared to that of the band 's video for " Here It Goes Again " , helping to boost live performances and single song sales for the group but did not significantly improve sales of the Colour album . Difficulties in marketing and distribution of the videos with their corporate label , EMI , led the band to form their own independent label shortly after the videos ' releases . 
 The song was featured in the films The Joneses , Freakonomics and The Vow . It was also featured in the video game Top Spin 4 . It was also used as the theme song for the U.S. version of The Inbetweeners . 
 = = Song = = 
 The lyrics to " This Too Shall Pass " are written to encourage its audience , burdened with some figurative weight , to " let it go , this too shall pass " in the near future instead of continuing to let the weight keep them from enjoying life , akin to the meaning of the original phrase , This too shall pass . The song continues much of the theme of Of the Blue Colour of the Sky , which , according to Damian Kulash , was about " searching for hope in hopeless times " ; " This Too Shall Pass " and other songs from the album were written at the onset of the late @-@ 2000s recession . Billboard considered the song to be a " psych @-@ pop anthem " , similar to MGMT 's " Kids " ; this is in part due to the album 's producer Dave Fridmann who had also worked with MGMT and The Flaming Lips and brought some of the same musical stylings along . 
 = = First music video : Marching Band = = 
 The first video for the song was released on YouTube on January 12 , 2010 , to coincide with the release of the album and the single . Directed by Brian L. Perkins , it was filmed in October , 2009 , in South Bend , Indiana . The video is somewhat unusual in that it does not feature the album version of the song . Rather , it features an original recording that was actually performed live during filming of the video . OK Go 's Tim Nordwind noted that the song lent itself well to large orchestration . 
 In the video , the members of OK Go are seen in a field wearing marching band garb . The uniforms were originally from Rochelle Township High School of Rochelle , Illinois . They begin to march , and as the song progresses , the band is joined by members of the University of Notre Dame 's Marching Band many of whom rise up camouflaged in ghillie suits . They are also joined in the final chorus by a children 's choir cobbled together from two local South Bend preschools . Like many of their other videos , the marching band video was shot in one take . 
 The marching band video was created to bridge the time between the release of the album and the expected completion of the Rube Goldberg video . The band had originally planned to release the marching band version after the debut of the Rube Goldberg video . However , they found time during October 2009 to work with the Notre Dame band , and realizing the length of time to complete the Rube Goldberg machine , went ahead and completed the marching band version . 
 = = Second music video : Rube Goldberg Machine = = 
 The second music video for " This Too Shall Pass " was directed by James Frost . Similar to the band 's video for " Here It Goes Again " , the " This Too Shall Pass " video features a four @-@ minute , apparent one shot sequence of the song being played in time to the actions of a giant Rube Goldberg machine built in a two @-@ story warehouse from over 700 household objects , traversing an estimated half @-@ mile course . As the song and machine operate , the members of the band are seen singing alongside the machine , with the members being shot at by paint guns at the song 's finale . Parts of the machine are synchronized in time with the music ; in one instance , glasses of water are used to repeat part of the song 's melody in the fashion of a glass harp . One part of the machine shows the " Here It Goes Again " video on a television before it is smashed by the machine . The <unk> magazine 1993 Ford Escort racecar , used for the 24 Hours of <unk> , appears in the video along with a miniature LEGO version of the car . Alongside the LEGO car , several LEGO mini @-@ figurines are displayed as a reference to the marching band video . 
 = = = Creation = = = 
 The video 's inspiration was from the band , who wanted " a giant machine that we dance with " , a long @-@ term aspiration of the band and inspired by other Rube Goldberg machines shown in videos on YouTube , including the interstitials used on the Japanese children 's show , <unk> . While they considered the idea of the machine for each song on Of the Colour , they opted to use " This Too Shall Pass " to make the end result " majestic and epic " , even though it already duplicated the previous marching band video . They sought help through online science message boards , eventually coming in contact with Syyn Labs . From a pool of talent at a Syyn Labs @-@ hosted " <unk> LA " gathering , about 55 to 60 people from Syyn Labs , the California Institute of Technology ( including some who work at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and participated in the Mars Exploration Rover program , hence the model rover seen in the video ) and MIT Media Lab helped to design and construct the machine . Damian Kulash 's father ( Damian Kulash Sr. ) also participated in the machine 's construction . 
 The team had to work on a limited budget , using recycled trash for many of the props in the device ; after filming , the total estimated cost was approximately $ 90 @,@ 000 . The team avoided the use of " magic " — automated devices like computers or motors — and instead focused on purely physical devices . The total time to create the video from conceptualization was about six months , with two months of planning and four months for design and filming . The warehouse where filming took place was in the Echo Park section of Los Angeles , and was secured by Syyn Labs in November 2009 . The final construction within the warehouse took over a month and a half during January and February 2010 . The band members helped in the last two weeks of construction , having spent the previous four months on tour . 
 Once the machine was completed , the filming , using a single Steadicam , took two days to complete on February 11 and 12 , with an estimated 60 takes for the machine to properly function . The first day of filming included 47 takes , none of which successfully completed the entire machine and necessitated a second day of filming . Many of the takes ended only 30 seconds into the process , at the start of the song 's chorus , where a tire would fail to roll properly into the next section of the machine . Syyn Labs had a group of 30 people to help reset the machine after each failed take , a process that took upwards of an hour depending on how far the machine ran . There were no significant injuries during filming ; Tim Nordwind once was hit hard with paint at the end , while the Steadicam operator nearly got hit with one of the barrels at the end of the mechanism in the shot used for the final video . His reaction may be seen in the released version of the video . 
 Several elements of the machine had to be properly adjusted to match the timing for the song . The group broke the song into sections , triggered when the machine passed certain gates , to account for small changes in timing that could occur ( up to 0 @.@ 5 sec , according to Brett Doar , one of the machine 's chief designers ) , allowing the band to continue to lip synch while the machine operated . Smaller objects like dominoes were found to be the trickiest to set , as their patterns would be less predictable than larger and bulkier objects , which are more predominant in the later parts of the machine . Once the machine transitioned to the downstairs portion , it would generally run the rest of the course untouched . Furthermore , the time of day and temperature would play a big factor in how some small components would behave , forcing the team to readjust the timing . Ball tracks and other features had to be wiped clear of dust and debris to prevent slowing down rolling objects . A carved wooden ball track shown early in the video was created to have motions timed to the music , but required a low inclined angle that would often cause the balls to skip out of the tracks . 
 Kulash noted that their largest " nightmare " for the machine was a set of <unk> , triggered to release a display of colored flags ; they were found to be overly sensitive to earlier actions of the machine , such as the dropping of a piano , and redesign and padding were needed to prevent the traps from being set off prematurely . The timing had to take into account the movements of both the band members and the cameraman ; Damien Kulash estimated that though the machine was able to complete its opening at least three times , these shots were botched , because either the band members or the cameraman had fallen behind the action of the machine . 
 While the video was filmed as a single shot on at least three different occasions , they planned on using post @-@ editing to slow down or speed up certain parts of the take to keep it in time with the final soundtrack . There is a noted cut in the video , in which the camera passes through a set of curtains on the transition to the downstairs portion of the machine ; according to one of the machine designers , Hector Alvarez , this cut was introduced by the band , speculating it was introduced to avoid a shot of one of the band members or cameraman in frame or otherwise to keep the machine video synchronized to the machine . Both Tim Nordwind , bassist for the band , and Adam <unk> , president of Syyn Labs , said that while the machine worked in its entirety 3 times , and no cut was needed , the decision was made so a better result on the downstairs portion could be included in the final version . There was also a second cut which can be noticed by watching a piano against a wall as the camera passed behind some rods ; the piano can be seen apparently warping in shape and position .

 The Rube Goldberg machine video premiered on YouTube on March 2 , 2010 . Within a day of the video 's premiere , it was viewed more than 900 @,@ 000 times . The video achieved 6 million views within six days , which was comparable to the popularity of the " Here It Goes Again " video , and was considered " instantly viral " by CNN . The video had more than 10 million views in its first month of release . As part of the success of both videos , the band has begun auctioning props from the videos , including uniforms worn by the band for the marching band video and the individual ping @-@ pong balls from the second video . The Rube Goldberg video was included in a shortlist of 125 entries out of 23 @,@ 000 for inclusion in " YouTube Play : A Biennial of Creative Video " , a showcase of the best user @-@ created videos from YouTube in conjunction with the Guggenheim Museums , but ultimately was not selected as one of the 25 winning videos . 
 Despite the success of the videos on the Internet , this has not translated into sales for the album Of the Blue Colour of the Sky which the song is a part of , selling only 40 @,@ 000 copies since its January release . Part of this is attributed to the " unremarkable " music on the album and for the video ; musician Max Tundra suggested that the band should " record an innovative , exciting piece of music – and make a plodding , nondescript video to go with it . " However , ticket sales for OK Go concerts have seen a surge since the video 's release , as well as sales of digital downloads of the song through services like iTunes . According to Nordwind , the band is not concerned with album sales , as their successes have come from " untraditional ways " through the band 's career . Kulash has stated that with the continued success of their music videos as viral videos as was the case for " This Too Shall Pass " , the band has seen more touring opportunities and an expanded audience they don 't believe they would have gotten with more traditional videos under corporate label control . This has led OK Go to " look at making videos like [ they ] look at making records — it 's part of the art of what [ they ] do " , according to Nordwind . In part of the success of " This Too Shall Pass " and their previous videos , OK Go won the 14th Annual Webby Special Achievement Award for Film and Video Artist of the Year . The video was named both " Video of the Year " and " Best Rock Video " at the 3rd annual UK Music Video Awards . 
 In May 2010 , after the band split with EMI , the single debuted at # 39 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart , their first appearance on the chart since " Here It Goes Again " in 2006 . The song eventually peaked at # 36 . 
 At the time of the creation of the video , Syyn Labs had just been formed ; the viral success of " This Too Shall Pass " brought the company to light for several similar creative projects involving the innovative combination of technology . When OK Go appeared on The Colbert Report on April 29 , 2010 in which they performed " This Too Shall Pass " , Stephen Colbert opened the show with another , shorter Rube Goldberg machine created by Syyn Lab 's Brett Doar , one of the chief creators of the " This Too Shall Pass " music video , using assorted props from the show . Syyn Labs have since created advertisements for Disney and Sears , and have been contacted for future work in music videos and movie opening sequences , and are considering a reality television show based on their creative process . 
 In February 2011 , music video blog Yes , We 've Got a Video ! ranked both the marching band video and the Rube Goldberg machine video at number 3 in their top 30 videos of 2010 . The latter in particular was praised for " the cleverness of it and the fact that you could always pick up something new upon each and every view . " The Song was also used as the theme for the American remake of British sitcom , The Inbetweeners . 
 = = Difficulties with EMI = = 
 The marching band video sparked much controversy online immediately after its release . Because of deals between the band 's label , EMI ( through Capitol Records ) , and YouTube , the video was not embeddable , nor was it viewable across the globe , frustrating many fans and music industry professionals who wanted to post the video on their blogs . The band , led by singer Damian Kulash , explained the label 's rationale via the band 's blog and through an op @-@ ed piece in The New York Times . According to Kulash , EMI disallowed the embeddable play of the video because they only receive royalties for views on the YouTube site itself . He further pleaded to allow embedding of their next video , citing a 90 % drop in viewership when EMI disabled embedding on existing videos , affecting the band 's own royalties from viewership . 
 The band was able to secure the rights to allow the " This Too Shall Pass " Rube Goldberg video to be distributed via embedding prior to its premiere , in part due to funding support from State Farm Insurance , which helped to settle issues with EMI ; in exchange , State Farm had some say in the creative process , and the video includes elements with the State Farm logo , including a toy truck that is used to start the machine . The video was completed a week later than expected ; according to sources close to the band , Capitol Records considered the window of opportunity for promoting the single to radio to be closed due to the delay , and would not be available again until June 2010 . The band has since decided to break away from the EMI label on amiable terms , due to a combination of the issues of video embedding and radio promotions , and has become its own independent recording label , <unk> Recordings .

 = = Casting = = 
 The role of Martha was originally played by Burcin Kapkin upon her introduction in 1988 . In 2005 the character returned to the show , played by the model Jodi Gordon . Gordon took acting lessons before successfully auditioning for the role . Gordon later revealed that she was initially nervous about auditioning due to her lack of acting experience . However , producers gave her two months prior to filming so she could learn her scripts and gain more acting skills . Gordon said , " I 'd never done any acting . So I did a few little acting course things and then I kind of fluked the part " . 
 During March 2007 , Gordon was written out of the show indefinitely after her partner , Chris Burkhardt , died from cancer . The Home and Away writers had previously rewritten several scripts to allow Gordon to spend as much time as possible with Burkhardt . 
 In 2009 , Gordon became the center of media attention due to a series of scandals in her private life . The serial 's home network Channel Seven decided to support Gordon through the ordeals . The scandals cast doubt over whether Gordon would be staying with the serial and it was reported that she wanted to leave Australia for other roles . However , it was later confirmed she would be staying with the show and a spokesperson said , " Jodi is looking forward , not backward , and is hard at work on the set of Home and Away " . Gordon was backed by her fellow cast members and fans of her character , who voiced their support for her . At the time Gordon was signed to appear in the serial for another two years after she had signed to a three @-@ year contract . 
 In January 2010 , it was announced that Gordon had decided to leave the show . She asked Channel Seven to release her two years early from her contract . Producers and network executives had urged her to stay with the show because her character was popular with viewers . Gordon said , " I 've had a wonderful five years with Channel Seven and Home and Away — it 's been an amazing experience to be a part of this incredible show . I 've learnt so much . " Gordon filmed her final scenes at the end of February . Fellow Actor Ray Meagher who plays Martha 's grandfather Alf Stewart backed her decision to leave the show , but said he was sad that his character would be left on @-@ screen without any blood relatives .

 = = = Characterisation = = = 
 Channel Seven described Martha as being " Friendly , straight down the line , and with a great enthusiasm for life " , and Jetstar magazine called Martha " a feisty addition to the Stewart family " . Gordon described Martha 's persona stating : " Martha 's pretty feisty all of the time but in the sense of always fighting for what 's right and keeping up a strong perspective on where I want to go , things like that . " Gordon says that she feels Martha always makes bad choices when it comes to her love life , because she never knows what she wants . Gordon said that Martha is " messed up " but with a " warm side " to her persona , and that overall Martha is " fun loving , easy going girl @-@ next @-@ door " type character . Of her portrayal , Gordon says that she enjoys the challenge of playing Martha because she gets to shout a lot when showing her crazy and fun side . Gordon later said that " There will always be a little bit of trouble attached to Martha . She will always be a little bit mischievous " . On the character 's appearance , RTÉ said " Martha was a self @-@ confessed tomboy , loving sport and anything physical . Now she has grown into a stylish woman with great taste in clothes which range from shorts and <unk> tops to gorgeous summer dresses . " 
 = = = Relationship with Jack Holden = = = 
 Most of Martha 's storylines were central to her on @-@ off relationship with Jack Holden ( Paul O 'Brien ) . Viewers saw the couple go through marriage , divorce , a second marriage and Martha being widowed . Holy Soap said that Martha and Jack proved to be one of the " best loved couples " , before they married for the first time . However , their marriage does not last long and they split . Martha and Jack start to lead separate lives , but Jack is there for Martha after she has an abortion . Martha is feeling low at this point and kisses him ; Jack 's girlfriend Sam Tolhurst ( Jessica <unk> ) sees this . O 'Brien stated : " I think Jack felt like ' Oh this is nice , but I 've moved on , I 've finally moved on and found someone ' , but deep down he still wants Martha . " Martha is left " shattered " after Jack plans to marry Sam . Martha was caught trying on Sam 's wedding dress as she tried to figure out if she still had feelings for Jack . Gordon said that from day one , Jack and Martha have wanted to be together , but " they 're never in the same headspace " . O 'Brien added that he believes Jack was always in love with Martha , even whilst he was in a relationship with Sam . Both O 'Brien and Gordon agreed that when Jack and Martha first broke up it was a bad time for Jack , as his life was spiraling out of control , he needed her , but she left him when he needed her the most . They later become friends ; O 'Brien believed it was hard to understand how Jack could be so forgiving toward her . 
 Although the characters were separated on screen , they had gained a fan base on the Internet that believed Martha should be with Jack and wanted the pair to reunite . Gordon herself backed the pairing , stating that she believed they should be together . She said : " I actually love Jack and Martha together , I 'm a sucker for romance so , I want want them to be together [ ... ] I want them to continue on , [ ... ] the timing is not right , they are not mature enough . Jack 's in a relationship with someone else as Martha is , there just seems to be things getting in the way of them getting back together all the time . " Gordon also hoped for a happy ending for the two characters if they were to ever leave the serial adding : " If I had it my way , and I got to write the scripts then I 'd make it happily ever after , Martha and Jack riding off into the sunset . " Gordon has spoken of her understanding from the audiences point of view , that together Jack and Martha are " the ultimate couple " . She also reiterated her belief that it would be to tough at the time of Martha 's downward spiral for them to work together , but if Martha is to get through her troubles and have a happy ending , that it would be with Jack . The Daily Telegraph commented on the Martha and Jack situation , saying it is played out in a " classic <unk> technique " . They said " Bring the characters together , push them apart , but always leave open the possibility that they could get back together . It has worked for Days of Our Lives ' John Black and Marlena Evans " . 
 On @-@ screen Jack and Martha later reconcile , after he helps her through her hard times . Gordon believed that their relationship was at its strongest peak whilst Martha had breast cancer . She added that Martha would do anything to avoid jeopardising their happiness . 
 = = = Downward spiral and stripping = = = 
 One of the most notable story lines for Martha was her secret life as a pole dancer and subsequent road into alcoholism . This was a result of her abortion and failed relationships with Jack and Ash Nader ( Ben <unk> ) along with her new relationship with Cameron " Cam " Reynolds ( Ashley Lyons ) , who was leading her astray . The story line began playing out from the 2006 " cliffhanger " episode , when Ash reveals that he is married with children and leading a double life . Gordon branded Martha as ignorant to the situation she has got herself into : " I think she is so naive , she wants to believe that she 's found a great guy and she keeps giving him second chances . She wants to make it work . " Martha fails to cope with the situation , as Gordon describes : " It 's this whole emotional roller @-@ coaster that , if you don 't deal with your life , can be terrible . " Their relationship falls apart after Martha aborts Ash 's child , causing Martha to begin her transition into a party girl . Gordon commented that " I think everyone in this show begins as a scruffy bum and gradually they turn you into a glamour puss . " 
 Martha begins a downward spiral and is manipulated by new boyfriend Cam , who has a hold over her due to his power and money , and her vulnerable state - he " swept her off her feet " . Cam always got the better of Martha because " The worse it got with her family , the better it got with Cam . " O 'Brien , who played Jack , said that he felt that Martha was trying to reinvent herself as a different person . 
 Gordon pointed out that Martha was not stripping , just pole dancing . Gordon took pole dancing lessons for a period of a few weeks funded by Channel Seven , and found the experience embarrassing and physically challenging . She found it hard dancing in front of her fellow cast members , commenting that " There 's even one scene when all of the boys turn up at the club and they 're looking at me – it 's like having your mates seeing you half naked . It 's not very nice , a bit intimidating but it 's always exciting to have a challenging story line like that . It 's worth while in the end knowing that you 've put everything into it . " Gordon believed that the storyline was a turning point in Martha 's development , as she has to hit rock bottom to realise who she is and what she really wants from life . 
 After everyone finds out about Martha 's situation , they try to stop her working in the club . Kate Ritchie who plays on @-@ screen friend Sally Fletcher discussed how Martha would not take any advice from those closest to her and how Sally and Alf have to pick up the pieces for her in the end . She compared Martha 's pole dancing to many real life experiences ordinary people go through . Sally 's interference made Martha 's situation worse , of this <unk> added : " It 's been hard for Sally to realise and Alf as well , just that you just have to stand back and let it run its course and be there at the end . " Of Martha 's downward spiral and pushing her friends away , Gordon stated : " Now she 's found herself in this hole , she ruined all these relationships with her family , her friends , Jack , everyone 's trying to help her and she 's really against everyone , she 's in a really bad place at the moment " . 
 The broadcast scenes proved to be controversial in Australia after broadcasting regulator ACMA felt the scenes featured sexual content . They noted that " ACMA determined that pole @-@ dancing scenes contained in the programmes contained visual depictions of sexual behaviour , that their impact was higher than very mild , and that the episodes were not suitable for children to watch without supervision . " Channel Seven defended the scenes and stated that whereas most episodes of the serial are PG rated they would take extra care to inform viewers of G rated episodes and to include material more suitable for children . Two years after the storyline aired , Gordon was reported to be a regular visitor to strip clubs as a result of her earlier visits whilst filming the storyline . 
 = = = Pregnancy and breast cancer = = = 
 In 2008 , viewers saw Martha coming to terms with a second pregnancy . The storyline began after Martha left old boyfriend Roman Harris ( Conrad Coleby ) for Jack . She was unsure of the child 's paternity , but kept it a secret from Jack . Gordon said this is " Because she doesn 't think he ever needs to know . Roman 's said he doesn 't want to be involved and he wants to say it 's Jack 's . And so does Martha ... " After Martha has a miscarriage scare , Roman wanted to know if the baby was his . Gordon explained that " Roman says he needs to know if he is or isn 't the baby 's father and Martha has to agree to do a DNA test . [ ... ] They wait till Jack 's out of the room then quickly arrange it . Martha 's so scared of losing Jack she wants the facts before deciding her next step . " Martha 's relationship with Jack was at its strongest at that time , but Gordon was concerned about Martha 's lies : " Martha and Jack have been through more than most and right now their relationship is as solid as it could be . But she 's taking a big chance not being honest about her pregnancy . " She described Roman being the baby 's father as " Martha 's worst nightmare " . 
 During the pregnancy storyline , Martha was also diagnosed with breast cancer . The storyline was introduced just over a year after Gordon 's partner , Chris Burkhardt , died from acute myeloid leukemia at the age of 23 . Gordon drew on her experience with Burkhardt to take on the storyline . Home and Away 's producer , Cameron Welsh , approached Gordon about the storyline and asked her if she would be comfortable doing it . Gordon called it an " amazing opportunity to be given " . Gordon said " The producer asked me if I wanted to do this storyline and made sure I was comfortable doing it based on what I had been through , I definitely think this one tops all of them " . Gordon added that anyone going through Martha 's ordeal would find it hard , but " you just look to your friends and family and do your best in that situation and then move on " . 
 Gordon and the writers researched the condition and made sure that the storyline " was pretty precise when it came to the medical and physical issues " . A couple of months before they started filming , everyone got together to discuss the storyline and map out the journey it would take . Viewers saw the character discovering a lump in her breast , going against doctors ' advice about terminating her pregnancy and subsequently going through with treatment for the cancer . Gordon later admitted that she found it " very tough " .

 = M ( James Bond ) = 
 M is a fictional character in Ian Fleming 's James Bond book and film series ; the character is the Head of the Secret Intelligence Service — also known as MI6 — and is Bond 's superior . Fleming based the character on a number of people he knew who commanded sections of British intelligence . M has appeared in the novels by Fleming and seven continuation authors , as well as appearing in twenty @-@ four films . In the Eon Productions series of films , M has been portrayed by four actors : Bernard Lee , Robert Brown , Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes , the incumbent ; in the two independent productions , M was played by John Huston , David Niven and Edward Fox . 
 = = Background = = 
 Fleming based much of M 's character on Rear Admiral John Godfrey , who was Fleming 's superior at the Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War . After Fleming 's death , Godfrey complained " He turned me into that unsavoury character , M. " 
 Other possible inspirations include Lieutenant Colonel Sir Claude Dansey , the deputy head of MI6 and head of the wartime Z network , who achieved different interpretations of his character from those who knew him : Malcolm Muggeridge thought him " the only professional in MI6 " , while Hugh Trevor @-@ Roper considered Dansey to be " an utter shit , corrupt , incompetent , but with a certain low cunning " . A further inspiration for M was Maxwell Knight , the head of MI5 , who signed his memos as " M " and whom Fleming knew well . The tradition of the head of MI6 signing their name with a single letter came from Mansfield Smith @-@ Cumming , who would sign his initial " C " with green ink . 
 Another possibility for the model of M was William Melville , an Irishman who became the head of the Secret Service Bureau , the forerunner to both MI5 and MI6 : Melville was referred to within government circles as M. Melville recruited Sidney Reilly into government service and foiled an assassination plot against Queen Victoria on her 1887 Golden Jubilee . Fleming 's biographer John Pearson also hypothesised that Fleming 's characterisation of M reflects memories of his mother : 
 = = Novels = = 
 Fleming 's third Bond novel , Moonraker , establishes M 's initials as " M * * * * M * * * * * * * " and his first name is subsequently revealed to be Miles . In the final novel of the series , The Man with the Golden Gun , M 's full identity is revealed as Vice Admiral Sir Miles Messervy KCMG ; Messervy had been appointed to head of MI6 after his predecessor had been assassinated at his desk . 
 A naval theme runs throughout Fleming 's description of M and his surroundings , and his character was described by journalist and Bond scholar Ben Macintyre as " every inch the naval martinet " . Macintyre also notes that in his study of Fleming 's work , Kingsley Amis outlined the way Fleming had described M 's voice , being : angry ( three times ) ; brutal , cold ( seven times ) ; curt , dry ( five times ) ; gruff ( seven times ) ; stern , testy ( five times ) . 
 Over the course of twelve novels and two collections of short stories , Fleming provided a number of details relating to M 's background and character . In On Her Majesty 's Secret Service it is revealed that M 's pay as head of the Secret Service is £ 6 @,@ 500 a year , ( £ 122 @,@ 749 in 2016 pounds ) £ 1 @,@ 500 of which comes from retired naval pay . Although his pay is good for the 1950s and 1960s , it is never explained how M received or can afford his membership at Blades , an upscale private club for gentlemen he frequents in London to gamble and dine . Blades has a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen and all must be able to show £ 100 @,@ 000 ( £ 1 @,@ 888 @,@ 453 in 2016 pounds ) in cash or gilt @-@ edged securities . Kingsley Amis noted in his study , The James Bond Dossier , that on M 's salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling . As a personal favour to M , the staff at Blades keeps a supply of cheap red wine from Algeria on hand but does not include it on the wine list . M refers to it as " <unk> " and tends only to drink it in moderate quantities unless he is in a very bad mood . 
 The academic Paul Stock argues that M 's office is a metonym for England and a stable point from which Bond departs on a mission , whilst he sees M as being an iconic representative of England and Englishness . 
 In the first post @-@ Fleming book , Colonel Sun , M is kidnapped from Quarterdeck , his home , and Bond goes to great lengths to rescue him . The later continuation books , written by John Gardner , retain Sir Miles Messervy as M , who protects Bond from the new , less aggressive climate in the Secret Service , saying that at some point Britain will need " a blunt instrument " . In Gardner 's final novel , COLD , M is kidnapped and rescued by Bond and finishes the book by retiring from MI6 . Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson 's 1998 novel The Facts of Death continued Messervy 's retirement , where he still resides in Quarterdeck . The book also introduces a new M , Barbara Mawdsley .

 M was played by Bernard Lee from the first Bond film , Dr. No , until Moonraker ( 1979 ) . In Dr. No , M refers to his record of reducing the number of operative casualties since taking the job , implying someone else held the job recently before him . The film also saw M refer to himself as head of <unk> ; Lee had originally said MI6 , but was overdubbed with the name <unk> prior to the film 's release . Earlier in the film , the department had been referred to as MI6 by a radio operator . 
 A number of Bond scholars have noted that Lee 's interpretation of the character was in line with the original literary representation ; Cork and Stutz observed that Lee was " very close to Fleming 's version of the character " , while Rubin commented on the serious , efficient , no @-@ nonsense authority figure . Smith and Lavington , meanwhile , remarked that Lee was " the very incarnation of Fleming 's crusty admiral . " 
 Lee died of cancer in January 1981 , four months into the filming of For Your Eyes Only and before any of his scenes could be filmed . Out of respect , no new actor was hired to assume the role , due to Broccoli refusing to have the character recast and , instead , the script was re @-@ written so that the character is said to be on leave , with his lines given to either his Chief of Staff Bill Tanner or the Minister of Defence , Sir Frederick Gray . Later films referred to Lee 's tenure as head of the service , with a painting of him as M in MI6 's Scottish headquarters during the 1999 instalment The World Is Not Enough .

 After Lee 's death in 1981 , the producers hired actor Robert Brown to play M in Octopussy . Brown had previously played Admiral Hargreaves , Flag Officer Submarines , in the 1977 film , The Spy Who Loved Me . Bond scholars Steven Jay Rubin , John Cork , and Collin Stutz all consider Admiral Hargreaves would have been appointed to the role of M , rather than Brown playing a different character as M. 
 Pfeiffer and Worrall considered that whilst Brown looks perfect , the role had been softened from that of Lee ; they also considered him " far too avuncular " , although in Licence to Kill they remarked that he came across as being very effective as he removed Bond 's double @-@ 0 licence . Continuation author Raymond Benson agrees , noting that the M role was " once again under written , and Brown is not allowed the opportunity to explore and reveal his character traits " ; Benson also considered the character to be " too nice " .

 = = = = Judi Dench : 1995 – 2012 = = = = 
 After the long period between Licence to Kill and GoldenEye , the producers brought in Dame Judi Dench to take over as the new M replacing Robert Brown . The character is based on Stella Rimington , the real @-@ life head of MI5 between 1992 and 1996 . For GoldenEye , Dench 's M is cold , blunt and initially dislikes Bond , whom she calls a " sexist , misogynist dinosaur , a relic of the Cold War . " Tanner , her Chief of Staff , refers to her during the film as " the Evil Queen of Numbers " , given her reputation at that stage for relying on statistics and analysis rather than impulse and initiative . 
 Following Pierce Brosnan 's departure from the role , Dench continued playing M for the 2006 film Casino Royale , which rebooted the series with Daniel Craig playing Bond . In this new continuity , M has worked for MI6 for some time , at one point muttering , " Christ , I miss the Cold War " . According to Skyfall , M was previously in charge of MI6 's operations in Hong Kong during the 1990s . Her ability to run MI6 has been questioned several times ; in Casino Royale , she is the subject of a review when Bond is caught shooting an unarmed prisoner and blowing up a foreign embassy on camera ; in Quantum of Solace , the Foreign Secretary orders her to personally withdraw Bond from the field in Bolivia and to stop any investigations into Dominic Greene 's eco @-@ terrorist organisation ; and in Skyfall , she is the subject of a public inquiry when MI6 loses a computer hard drive containing the identities of undercover agents around the world . Skyfall marks Dench 's final appearance as M , where she is targeted by former MI6 agent Raoul Silva , whom she left to die during a mission in order to save six other agents . She is shot and killed in the film , making her the only M to die in the Eon Bond films . Dench 's M makes a cameo appearance in Spectre in a video will , giving Bond a final order to hunt down and terminate someone , which ultimately leads him to the film 's titular criminal organisation . 
 There have also been brief references to M 's family : in GoldenEye , she responds to Tanner 's " Evil Queen of Numbers " jibe by telling him that when she wants to hear sarcasm she will listen to her children . Quantum of Solace director Marc Forster suggested that Dench 's casting gave the character maternal overtones in her relationship with Bond , overtones made overt in Skyfall , in which Silva repeatedly refers to her as " Mother " and " Mommy " [ sic ] . In Skyfall she is also revealed to be a widow . 
 Unlike the M played by other actors , Dench 's M was never referred to by name on @-@ screen . However , a prop from the final scene of Skyfall , where M bequeaths some of her possessions to Bond following her death , revealed that her character was given the name " Olivia Mansfield " . As the character was never directly referred to by this name , its canonicity is unresolved .

He served in Northern Ireland with the Special Air Service during the Troubles , where he had been held hostage by the Irish Republican Army for three months . In Spectre , the 00 Section of MI6 is briefly dismantled and Mallory demoted .

 In 1983 's Never Say Never Again , Edward Fox played M as a bureaucrat , contemptuous of Bond — far removed from the relationship shared between Bernard Lee 's M and Sean Connery 's Bond ; the academic Jeremy Black notes that the contempt felt for the 00 section by Fox 's M was reciprocated by Connery 's Bond .

 Incoming is a 3D shooter video game developed by Rage Software and published by Interplay . The game was first released for the PC in late 1998 , and was followed by a Sega Dreamcast version , which was released in Japan on December 17 , 1998 , in Europe on October 14 , 1999 , and in North America on November 30 , 1999 . Set in the near @-@ future of 2009 , the game primarily revolves around controlling vehicles and turrets to fight alien invaders of Earth in one of the Campaign modes , the Arcade mode , and with or against another player . Some levels include brief real @-@ time strategy segments . 
 Praised for its then @-@ advanced graphics and sound , the game was generally well @-@ received on the PC , though the critical response was less positive for the Dreamcast version . A sequel entitled Incoming Forces was released in 2002 exclusively for the PC . An arcade version of the game , utilising a unique hardware interface , was released in 2003 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Primarily a vehicle simulation game , the player controls one of a number of possible vehicles in order to complete objectives . The vehicle used could be an aerial craft , defence emplacement , or surface craft , and is usually armed with a primary weapon ( with infinite ammunition ) and sometimes secondary weapons ( with either a limited or infinite supply ) . Incoming was also noted for its arcade style ; in particular , the logging of high scores and a " life " system . 
 There are three different game modes . The campaign mode follows the main storyline in which the player must complete a series of objectives to neutralise the alien threat . Typical goals include transporting cargo and defending allied convoys . Two variants of the campaign exist : " campaign action " purely consists of the simulation missions ; " campaign tactics " features the same main missions as campaign action , but with some extra sub @-@ missions . These sub @-@ missions take place in the " tactical display " , where the player controls several vehicles and gun emplacements in a similar manner to real @-@ time strategy games . 
 Either campaign consists of ten missions ( referred to as " phases " in the game ) in each of the six locations . These locations can also be accessed in the arcade mode . This mode sees the player fight off alien craft while picking up as many " power @-@ ups " ( items which confer some advantage upon the player , such as temporary invulnerability and upgraded weaponry ) as is possible . The same mechanics apply to the multiplayer mode , with some slight variations depending on the game type selected . Multiplayer is available in split @-@ screen mode on both platforms in addition to networking and Internet options on the PC version . 
 = = Story = = 
 Acknowledged by critics for having a simple storyline , Incoming is set in 2009 over a period of fifteen days . An increasing number of UFO sightings culminate in attacks on the international lunar base and other locations on Earth ; and the construction of a base in the Arctic . Secret work is started on an " ADATA " ( Anomaly Detection And Tracking Array ) near Mount Kilimanjaro . The events of the game take place after an attack on the ADATA facility is initiated by alien forces . 
 The game is set in six locations : Kenya , defending the ADATA facility ; the Arctic , attacking an alien base while defending a human one ; the North Atlantic Ocean , where the player must defend oil rigs and attack a second alien base ; California , where parts of a fleet to invade the alien 's moon base must be defended ; the Moon , attacking a further alien base ; and a planet in the Crab Nebula , assaulting the planet from which the alien attackers came . 
 If the player has completed these in the Campaign Action mode , then in addition to these ten missions in each location , there are bonus " virus " scenarios , with one level in each location . Shortly before these missions , the aliens launched four virus bombs which impacted in the four location on Earth the player had previously visited . All buildings in these areas must be destroyed by the player to prevent the virus from spreading further .

" PC Zone praised the setting of the game : " a refreshing change from the deep space of most futuristic combat sims , and something which definitely has a positive effect on gameplay . " The review concluded by saying that " it 's as fun as it looks . Just for once , all those people who don 't read reviews and buy games purely on the strength of pretty pictures on the packaging are gonna find themselves playing a very , very enjoyable game . " 
 Though considering the game " pretty darn tough , " IGN praised the game 's variety and length . It also praised the sound and graphics , though the latter was a source of criticism : " Incoming 's got it all ... but it all comes at a high price : getting this game to run on our PCs was one big pain in the butt . " Despite calling it " an outstanding @-@ looking and great playing game , " IGN only gave the game a " decent " 7 @.@ 0 / 10 because of the system problems . Conversely , GameSpot 's review noted none of these hardware issues , praising the visuals as " some of the finest ... of any action game " . The reviewer , however , described the game design as " strong yet slightly flawed ... [ it ] definitely pulls you in , but leaves a little to be desired as far as keeping you there , " complaining that " what [ the developer ] have presented gets tiresome quickly . " Rating the game 7 @.@ 8 / 10 , GameSpot summarised the game as " a fine game and a definite must @-@ have for arcade fans ... What it lacks is a realization that computer games have moved beyond this simplistic style of gameplay " . 
 The Dreamcast port of Incoming received a mixed reaction from critics , with a Game Rankings average score of 63 % . IGN opened their review by saying that " although the game is lacking in many areas , there 's more than enough here for the hardcore shooting fans out there to have their requisite blast of shooting action . " Though criticizing the graphics ' ability to " get in the way at times , " the " very vague " mission briefings and the " odd flying model for the planes , " the reviewer conceded that " if you 're a hardcore shooting fan , and you 're looking for a good challenge , you 'll probably want to look into Incoming . " The game was given as score of 7 @.@ 0 / 10 . GameSpy 's review was harsher , describing the plot as " the same recycled garbage used in tons of other games of this type , " the multiplayer split screen mode as " lame " and the objectives as " mundane . " The reviewer also noted graphical issues , clipping problems and poor controls . Though dismissing the graphics as " a bit dated , " the reviewer did acknowledge the " nifty special effects . " Giving the game a score of 6 / 10 , it was admitted that " Incoming may be worth a rental ... [ it ] is only slightly better than mediocre . " 
 In a rare positive review for the Dreamcast version , GameVortex rated the game 9 / 10 . The reviewer described the visuals as " some of the most breathtaking visuals you 'll find in any game . " Though describing the multiplayer as " fun " , it considered " by far , the best [ mode to be ] Campaign mode .

 = German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee = 
 Admiral Graf Spee was a Deutschland @-@ class " Panzerschiff " ( armored ship ) , nicknamed a " pocket battleship " by the British , which served with the Kriegsmarine of Nazi Germany during World War II . The two sister @-@ ships of her class , Deutschland and Admiral Scheer , were reclassified as heavy cruisers in 1940 . The vessel was named after Admiral Maximilian von Spee , commander of the East Asia Squadron that fought the battles of Coronel and the Falkland Islands , where he was killed in action , in World War I. She was laid down at the Reichsmarinewerft shipyard in Wilhelmshaven in October 1932 and completed by January 1936 . The ship was nominally under the 10 @,@ 000 long tons ( 10 @,@ 000 t ) limitation on warship size imposed by the Treaty of Versailles , though with a full load displacement of 16 @,@ 020 long tons ( 16 @,@ 280 t ) , she significantly exceeded it . Armed with six 28 cm ( 11 in ) guns in two triple gun turrets , Admiral Graf Spee and her sisters were designed to outgun any cruiser fast enough to catch them . Their top speed of 28 knots ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) left only the few battlecruisers in the Anglo @-@ French navies fast enough and powerful enough to sink them . 
 The ship conducted five non @-@ intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in 1936 – 1938 , and participated in the Coronation Review of King George VI in May 1937 . Admiral Graf Spee was deployed to the South Atlantic in the weeks before the outbreak of World War II , to be positioned in merchant sea lanes once war was declared . Between September and December 1939 , the ship sank nine ships totaling 50 @,@ 089 gross register tons ( GRT ) , before being confronted by three British cruisers at the Battle of the River Plate on 13 December . Admiral Graf Spee inflicted heavy damage on the British ships , but she too was damaged , and was forced to put into port at Montevideo . Convinced by false reports of superior British naval forces approaching his ship , Hans Langsdorff , the commander of the ship , ordered the vessel to be scuttled . The ship was partially broken up in situ , though part of the ship remains visible above the surface of the water .

 Admiral Graf Spee was 186 meters ( 610 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 21 @.@ 65 m ( 71 @.@ 0 ft ) and a maximum draft of 7 @.@ 34 m ( 24 @.@ 1 ft ) . The ship had a design displacement of 14 @,@ 890 t ( 14 @,@ 650 long tons ; 16 @,@ 410 short tons ) and a full load displacement of 16 @,@ 020 long tons ( 16 @,@ 280 t ) , though the ship was officially stated to be within the 10 @,@ 000 long tons ( 10 @,@ 000 t ) limit of the Treaty of Versailles . Admiral Graf Spee was powered by four sets of MAN 9 @-@ cylinder double @-@ acting two @-@ stroke diesel engines . The ship 's top speed was 28 @.@ 5 knots ( 52 @.@ 8 km / h ; 32 @.@ 8 mph ) , at 54 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 40 @,@ 000 kW ) . At a cruising speed of 18 @.@ 69 knots ( 34 @.@ 61 km / h ; 21 @.@ 51 mph ) , the ship had a range of 16 @,@ 300 nautical miles ( 30 @,@ 200 km ; 18 @,@ 800 mi ) . As designed , her standard complement consisted of 33 officers and 586 enlisted men , though after 1935 this was significantly increased to 30 officers and 921 – 1 @,@ 040 sailors . 
 Admiral Graf Spee 's primary armament was six 28 cm ( 11 @.@ 0 in ) SK C / 28 guns mounted in two triple gun turrets , one forward and one aft of the superstructure . The ship carried a secondary battery of eight 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) SK C / 28 guns in single turrets grouped amidships . Her anti @-@ aircraft battery originally consisted of three 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) L / 45 guns , though in 1935 these were replaced with six 8 @.@ 8 cm L / 78 guns . In 1938 , the 8 @.@ 8 cm guns were removed , and six 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) L / 65 guns , four 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns , and ten 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) guns were installed in their place . The ship also carried a pair of quadruple 53 @.@ 3 cm ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) deck @-@ mounted torpedo launchers placed on her stern . The ship was equipped with two Arado Ar 196 seaplanes and one catapult . Admiral Graf Spee 's armored belt was 60 to 80 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 to 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick ; her upper deck was 17 mm ( 0 @.@ 67 in ) thick while the main armored deck was 17 to 45 mm ( 0 @.@ 67 to 1 @.@ 77 in ) thick . The main battery turrets had 140 mm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) thick faces and 80 mm thick sides . Radar consisted of a FMG G ( gO ) " Seetakt " set ; Admiral Graf Spee was the first German warship to be equipped with radar equipment . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Admiral Graf Spee was ordered by the Reichsmarine from the Reichsmarinewerft shipyard in Wilhelmshaven . Ordered as Ersatz Braunschweig , Admiral Graf Spee replaced the reserve battleship Braunschweig . Her keel was laid on 1 October 1932 , under construction number 125 . The ship was launched on 30 June 1934 ; at her launching , she was christened by the daughter of Admiral Maximilian von Spee , the ship 's namesake . She was completed slightly over a year and a half later on 6 January 1936 , the day she was commissioned into the German fleet . 
 Admiral Graf Spee spent the first three months of her career conducting extensive sea trials to ready the ship for service . The ship 's first commander was Kapitän zur See ( KzS ) Conrad <unk> ; he was replaced in 1937 by KzS Walter <unk> . After joining the fleet , Admiral Graf Spee became the flagship of the German Navy . In the summer of 1936 , following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War , she deployed to the Atlantic to participate in non @-@ intervention patrols off the Republican @-@ held coast of Spain . Between August 1936 and May 1937 , the ship conducted three patrols off Spain . On the return voyage from Spain , Admiral Graf Spee stopped in Great Britain to represent Germany in the Coronation Review at Spithead for King George VI on 20 May . 
 After the conclusion of the Review , Admiral Graf Spee returned to Spain for a fourth non @-@ intervention patrol . Following fleet manoeuvres and a brief visit to Sweden , the ship conducted a fifth and final patrol in February 1938 . In 1938 , KzS Hans Langsdorff took command of the vessel ; she conducted a series of goodwill visits to various foreign ports throughout the year . These included cruises into the Atlantic , where she stopped in Tangier and Vigo . She also participated in extensive fleet manoeuvres in German waters . She was part of the celebrations for the reintegration of the port of Memel into Germany , and a fleet review in honour of Admiral Miklós Horthy , the Regent of Hungary . Between 18 April and 17 May 1939 , she conducted another cruise into the Atlantic , stopping in the ports of Ceuta and Lisbon . On 21 August 1939 , Admiral Graf Spee departed Wilhelmshaven , bound for the South Atlantic . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 Following the outbreak of war between Germany and the Allies in September 1939 , Adolf Hitler ordered the German Navy to begin commerce raiding against Allied merchant traffic . Hitler nevertheless delayed issuing the order until it became clear that Britain would not countenance a peace treaty following the conquest of Poland . The Admiral Graf Spee was instructed to strictly adhere to prize rules , which required raiders to stop and search ships for contraband before sinking them , and to ensure that their crews are safely evacuated . Langsdorff was ordered to avoid combat , even with inferior opponents , and to frequently change position . On 1 September , the cruiser rendezvoused with her supply ship Altmark southwest of the Canary Islands . While replenishing his fuel supplies , Langsdorff ordered superfluous equipment transferred to the Altmark ; this included several of the ship 's boats , flammable paint , and two of her ten 2 cm anti @-@ aircraft guns , which were installed on the tanker . 
 On 11 September , while still transferring supplies from Altmark , Admiral Graf Spee 's Arado floatplane spotted the British heavy cruiser HMS Cumberland approaching the two German ships . Langsdorff ordered both vessels to depart at high speed , successfully evading the British cruiser . On 26 September , the ship finally received orders authorizing attacks on Allied merchant shipping . Four days later Admiral Graf Spee 's Arado located Booth Steam Ship Co 's cargo ship Clement off the coast of Brazil . The cargo ship transmitted an " RRR " signal ( " I am under attack by a raider " ) before the cruiser ordered her to stop . Admiral Graf Spee took Clement 's captain and chief engineer prisoner but let the rest of her crew to abandon ship in the lifeboats . The cruiser then fired 30 rounds from her 28 cm and 15 cm guns and two torpedoes at the cargo ship , which broke up and sank . Langsdorff ordered a distress signal sent to the naval station in Pernambuco to ensure the rescue of the ship 's crew . The British Admiralty immediately issued a warning to merchant shipping that a German surface raider was in the area . The British crew later reached the Brazilian coast in their lifeboats . 
 On 5 October , the British and French navies formed eight groups to hunt down Admiral Graf Spee in the South Atlantic . The British aircraft carriers HMS Hermes , Eagle , and Ark Royal , the French aircraft carrier Béarn , the British battlecruiser Renown , and French battleships Dunkerque and Strasbourg , and 16 cruisers were committed to the hunt . Force G , commanded by Commodore Henry Harwood and assigned to the east coast of South America , comprised the cruisers Cumberland and Exeter . Force G was reinforced by the light cruisers Ajax and Achilles ; Harwood detached Cumberland to patrol the area off the Falkland Islands while his other three cruisers patrolled off the River Plate . 
 On the same day as the formation of the Anglo @-@ French hunter groups , Admiral Graf Spee captured the steamer Newton Beech . Two days later , she encountered and sank the merchant ship <unk> . On 8 October , the following day , she sank Newton Beech , which Langsdorff had been using to house prisoners . Newton Beech was too slow to keep up with Admiral Graf Spee , and so the prisoners were transferred to the cruiser . On 10 October , she captured the steamer Huntsman , the captain of which had not sent a distress signal until the last minute , as he had mistakenly identified Admiral Graf Spee as a French warship . Unable to accommodate the crew from Huntsman , Admiral Graf Spee sent the ship to a rendezvous location with a prize crew . On 15 October , Admiral Graf Spee rendezvoused with Altmark to refuel and transfer prisoners ; the following morning , the prize Huntsman joined the two ships . The prisoners aboard Huntsman were transferred to Altmark and Langsdorff then sank Huntsman on the night of 17 October . 
 On 22 October , Admiral Graf Spee encountered and sank the steamer <unk> . At the end of October , Langsdorff sailed his ship into the Indian Ocean south of Madagascar . The purpose of that foray was to divert Allied warships away from the South Atlantic , and to confuse the Allies about his intentions . By this time , Admiral Graf Spee had cruised for almost 30 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 56 @,@ 000 km ; 35 @,@ 000 mi ) and needed an engine overhaul . On 15 November , the ship sank the tanker Africa Shell , and the following day , she stopped an unidentified Dutch steamer , though did not sink her . Admiral Graf Spee returned to the Atlantic between 17 and 26 November to refuel from Altmark . While replenishing supplies , the crew of Admiral Graf Spee built a dummy gun turret on her bridge and erected a dummy second funnel behind the aircraft catapult to alter her silhouette significantly in a bid to confuse allied shipping as to her true identity . 
 Admiral Graf Spee 's Arado floatplane located the merchant ship Doric Star : Langsdorff fired a shot across her bow to stop the ship . Doric Star was able to send out a distress signal before she was sunk , which prompted Harwood to take his three cruisers to the mouth of the River Plate , which he estimated would be Langsdorff 's next target . On the night of 5 December , Admiral Graf Spee sank the steamer Tairoa . The next day , she met with Altmark and transferred 140 prisoners from Doric Star and Tairoa . Admiral Graf Spee encountered her last victim on the evening of 7 December : the freighter <unk> . The prize crew recovered secret documents containing shipping route information . Based on that information , Langsdorff decided to head for the seas off Montevideo . On 12 December , the ship 's Arado 196 broke down and could not be repaired , depriving Graf Spee of her aerial reconnaissance . The ship 's disguise was removed , so it would not hinder the ship in battle . 
 = = = = Battle of the River Plate = = = = 
 At 05 : 30 on the morning of 13 December 1939 , lookouts spotted a pair of masts off the ship 's starboard bow . Langsdorff assumed this to be the escort for a convoy mentioned in the documents recovered from Tairoa . At 05 : 52 , however , the ship was identified as HMS Exeter ; she was accompanied by a pair of smaller warships , initially thought to be destroyers but quickly identified as Leander @-@ class cruisers . Langsdorff decided not to flee from the British ships , and so ordered his ship to battle stations and to close at maximum speed . At 06 : 08 , the British spotted Admiral Graf Spee ; Commodore Harwood divided his forces up to split the fire of Admiral Graf Spee 's 28 cm guns . The German ship opened fire with her main battery at Exeter and her secondary guns at the flagship Ajax at 06 : 17 . At 06 : 20 , Exeter returned fire , followed by Ajax at 06 : 21 and Achilles at 06 : 24 . In the span of thirty minutes , Admiral Graf Spee had hit Exeter three times , disabling her two forward turrets , destroying her bridge and her aircraft catapult , and starting major fires . Ajax and Achilles moved closer to Admiral Graf Spee to relieve the pressure on Exeter . 
 Langsdorff thought the two light cruisers were making a torpedo attack , and turned away under a smokescreen . The respite allowed Exeter to withdraw from the action ; by now , only one of her gun turrets was still in action , and she had suffered 61 dead and 23 wounded crew members . At around 07 : 00 , Exeter returned to the engagement , firing from her stern turret . Admiral Graf Spee fired on her again , scored more hits , and forced Exeter to withdraw again , this time with a list to port . At 07 : 25 , Admiral Graf Spee scored a hit on Ajax that disabled her aft turrets . Both sides broke off the action , Admiral Graf Spee retreating into the River Plate estuary , while Harwood 's battered cruisers remained outside to observe any possible breakout attempts . In the course of the engagement , Admiral Graf Spee had been hit approximately 70 times ; 36 men were killed and 60 more were wounded , including Langsdorff , who had been wounded twice by splinters while standing on the open bridge . 
 = = = = Scuttling = = = = 
 As a result of battle damage and casualties , Langsdorff decided to put into Montevideo , where repairs could be effected and the wounded men could be evacuated from the ship . Most of the hits scored by the British cruisers caused only minor structural and superficial damage but the oil purification plant , which was required to prepare the diesel fuel for the engines , was destroyed . Her desalination plant and galley were also destroyed , which would have increased the difficulty of a return to Germany . A hit in the bow would also have negatively affected her seaworthiness in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic . Admiral Graf Spee had fired much of her ammunition in the engagement with Harwood 's cruisers . 
 After arriving in port , the wounded crewmen were taken to local hospitals and the dead were buried with full military honours . Captive Allied seamen still aboard the ship were released . Repairs necessary to make the ship seaworthy were expected to take up to two weeks . British naval intelligence worked to convince Langsdorff that vastly superior forces were concentrating to destroy his ship , if he attempted to break out of the harbour . The Admiralty broadcast a series of signals , on frequencies known to be intercepted by German intelligence . The closest heavy units — the carrier Ark Royal and battlecruiser Renown — were some 2 @,@ 500 nmi ( 4 @,@ 600 km ; 2 @,@ 900 mi ) away , much too far to intervene in the situation . Believing the British reports , Langsdorff discussed his options with commanders in Berlin . These were either to break out and seek refuge in Buenos Aires , where the Argentine government would intern the ship , or to scuttle the ship in the Plate estuary . 
 Langsdorff was unwilling to risk the lives of his crew , so he decided to scuttle the ship . He knew that although Uruguay was neutral , the government was on friendly terms with Britain and if he allowed his ship to be interned , the Uruguayan Navy would allow British intelligence officers access to the ship . Under Article 17 of the Hague Convention , neutrality restrictions limited Admiral Graf Spee to a period of 72 hours for repairs in Montevideo , before she would be interned for the duration of the war . On 17 December 1939 , Langsdorff ordered the destruction of all important equipment aboard the ship . The ship 's remaining ammunition supply was dispersed throughout the ship , in preparation for scuttling . On 18 December , the ship , with only Langsdorff and 40 other men aboard , moved into the outer roadstead to be scuttled . A crowd of 20 @,@ 000 watched as the scuttling charges were set ; the crew was taken off by an Argentine tug and the ship was scuttled at 20 : 55 . The multiple explosions from the munitions sent jets of flame high into the air and created a large cloud of smoke that obscured the ship which burned in the shallow water for the next two days . 
 On 20 December , in his room in a Buenos Aires hotel , Langsdorff shot himself in full dress uniform and lying on the ship 's battle ensign . In late January 1940 , the neutral American cruiser USS Helena arrived in Montevideo and the crew was permitted to visit the wreck of Admiral Graf Spee . The Americans met the German crewmen , who were still in Montevideo . In the aftermath of the scuttling , the ship 's crew were taken to Argentina , where they were interned for the remainder of the war . 
 = = = Wreck = = = 
 The wreck was partially broken up in situ in 1942 – 1943 , though parts of the ship are still visible ; the wreck lies at a depth of only 11 m ( 36 ft ) . The salvage rights were purchased from the German Government by the British , for £ 14 @,@ 000 , using a Montevideo engineering company as a front . The British had been surprised by the accuracy of the shooting and expected to find a radar range finder and were not disappointed . They used the knowledge thus acquired to try to develop countermeasures , under the leadership of Fred Hoyle at the British radar project . The Admiralty complained about the large sum paid for the salvage rights . 
 In February 2004 , a salvage team began work raising the wreck of Admiral Graf Spee . The operation was in part being funded by the government of Uruguay , in part by the private sector as the wreck was a hazard to navigation . The first major section — a 27 metric tons ( 27 long tons ; 30 short tons ) gunnery range @-@ finding <unk> — was raised on 25 February . On 10 February 2006 , the 2 m ( 6 ft 7 in ) , 400 kg eagle and swastika crest of Admiral Graf Spee was recovered from the stern of the ship ; it was stored in a Uruguayan naval warehouse following German complaints about exhibiting " Nazi paraphernalia " . 
 = Sesame Street = 
 Sesame Street is a long @-@ running American children 's television series created by Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett . The program is known for its educational content , and images communicated through the use of Jim Henson 's Muppets , animation , short films , humor , and cultural references . The series premiered on November 10 , 1969 , to positive reviews , some controversy , and high viewership ; it has aired on the U.S. ' s national public television provider ( PBS ) since its debut , with its first run moving to premium channel HBO on January 16 , 2016 . 
 The show has undergone significant changes throughout its history . The format of Sesame Street consists of a combination of commercial television production elements and techniques which have evolved to reflect the changes in American culture and the audience 's viewing habits . With the creation of Sesame Street , producers and writers of a children 's television show used , for the first time , educational goals and a curriculum to shape its content . It was also the first time a show 's educational effects were studied . 
 Shortly after creating Sesame Street , its producers developed what came to be called the " CTW model " ( named for the show 's production company , the Children 's Television Workshop ) , a system of television show planning , production , and evaluation based on collaborations between producers , writers , educators , and researchers . The show was initially funded by government and private foundations but has become somewhat self @-@ supporting due to revenues from licensing arrangements , international sales , and other media . By 2006 , there were independently produced versions , or " co @-@ productions " , of Sesame Street broadcast in twenty countries . In 2001 there were over 120 million viewers of various international versions of Sesame Street , and by the show 's 40th anniversary in 2009 , it was broadcast in more than 140 countries . 
 By its 40th anniversary in 2009 , Sesame Street was the fifteenth @-@ highest rated children 's television show in the United States . A 1996 survey found that 95 % of all American preschoolers had watched the show by the time they were three years old . In 2008 , it was estimated that 77 million Americans had watched the series as children . As of 2014 , Sesame Street has won 159 Emmy Awards and 8 Grammy Awards — more than any other children 's show . 
 = = History = = 
 Sesame Street was conceived in 1966 during discussions between television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and Carnegie Foundation vice president Lloyd Morrisett . Their goal was to create a children 's television show that would " master the addictive qualities of television and do something good with them " , such as helping young children prepare for school . After two years of research the newly formed Children 's Television Workshop ( CTW ) received a combined grant of US $ 8 million ( $ 52 million in 2016 dollars ) from the Carnegie Foundation , the Ford Foundation , and the U.S. Federal Government to create and produce a new children 's television show . The program premiered on public television stations on November 10 , 1969 . It was the first preschool educational television program to base its contents and production values on laboratory and formative research . Initial responses to the show included adulatory reviews , some controversy , and high ratings . By its 40th anniversary in 2009 , Sesame Street was broadcast in over 120 countries , and 20 international versions had been produced . 
 Sesame Street has evolved from its initial inception . According to writer Michael Davis , by the mid @-@ 1970s the show had become " an American institution " . The cast and crew expanded during this time , with emphasis on the hiring of women crew members and the addition of minorities to the cast . The show 's success continued into the 1980s . In 1981 , when the federal government withdrew its funding , CTW turned to , and expanded , other revenue sources , including its magazine division , book royalties , product licensing , and foreign broadcast income . Sesame Street 's curriculum has expanded to include more affective topics such as relationships , ethics , and emotions . Many of the show 's storylines were taken from the experiences of its writing staff , cast , and crew , most notably , the 1982 death of Will Lee — who played Mr. Hooper — and the marriage of Luis and Maria in 1988 . 
 In recent years Sesame Street has faced societal and economic challenges , including changes in viewing habits of young children , competition from other shows , the development of cable television , and a drop in ratings . After the turn of the 21st century , Sesame Street made major structural changes . For example , starting in 2002 , its format became more narrative and included ongoing storylines . After its thirtieth anniversary in 1999 and due to the popularity of the Muppet Elmo , the show also incorporated a popular segment known as " Elmo 's World " . Upon its fortieth anniversary in 2009 , the show received a Lifetime Achievement Emmy at the 36th Daytime Emmy Awards . 
 On August 13 , 2015 , as part of a five @-@ year programming and development deal , Sesame Workshop announced that first @-@ run episodes of Sesame Street would move to premium television service HBO beginning with season 46 , which premiered on January 16 , 2016 . HBO will hold first @-@ run rights to all newer episodes of the series , after which they will air on PBS member stations following a nine @-@ month exclusivity window , with no charge to the stations for airing the content . The agreement also gives HBO exclusive rights to stream past and future Sesame Street episodes on HBO Go and HBO Now – assuming those rights from Amazon Video and Netflix ; on August 14 , Sesame Workshop announced that it would phase out its in @-@ house subscription streaming service , Sesame Go , as a standalone service ; the service will remain in operation , likely with its offerings reduced to a slate content available for free or serving as a portal for Sesame Street 's website . The deal came in the wake of cutbacks that had affected the series in recent years , the changing viewer habits of American children in the previous ten years , and Sesame Workshop 's dependence upon revenue from DVD sales . 
 = = Format = = 
 From its first episode , Sesame Street has structured its format by using " a strong visual style , fast @-@ moving action , humor , and music , " as well as animation and live @-@ action short films . When Sesame Street premiered , most researchers believed that young children did not have long attention spans , therefore the new show 's producers were concerned that an hour @-@ long show would not hold their audience 's attention . At first , the show 's " street scenes " — the action taking place on its set — consisted of character @-@ driven interactions and were not written as ongoing stories . Instead , they consisted of individual , curriculum @-@ based segments which were interrupted by " inserts " consisting of puppet sketches , short films , and animations . This structure allowed the producers to use a mixture of styles and characters , and to vary the show 's pace . By season 20 , research had shown that children were able to follow a story , and the street scenes , while still interspersed with other segments , became evolving storylines . 
 Upon recommendations by child psychologists , the producers initially decided that the show 's human actors and Muppets would not interact because they were concerned it would confuse young children . When the CTW tested the appeal of the new show , they found that although children paid attention to the shows during the Muppet segments , their interest was lost during the " Street " segments . The producers requested that Henson and his team create Muppets such as Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch to interact with the human actors , and the Street segments were re @-@ shot . Sesame Street 's format remained intact until the show 's later decades , when the changing audience required that producers move to a more narrative format . In 1998 the popular segment " Elmo 's World " , a 15 @-@ minute long segment hosted by the Muppet Elmo , was created . Starting in 2014 , during the show 's 45th season , the producers introduced a bonus half @-@ hour version of the program . The new version , which complemented the full @-@ hour series , was both broadcast weekday afternoons and streamed on the internet . 
 = = Educational goals = = 
 As author Malcolm Gladwell has stated , " Sesame Street was built around a single , breakthrough insight : that if you can hold the attention of children , you can educate them " . Gerald S. Lesser , the CTW 's first advisory board chair , went even further , saying that the effective use of television as an educational tool needed to capture , focus , and sustain children 's attention . Sesame Street was the first children 's show to structure each episode , and the segments within them , to capture children 's attention , and to make , as Gladwell put it , " small but critical adjustments " to keep it . According to CTW researchers Rosemarie Truglio and Shalom Fisch , Sesame Street was one of the few children 's television programs to utilize a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum , garnered from formative and summative research . 
 The creators of Sesame Street and their researchers formulated both cognitive and affective goals for the show . Initially , they focused on cognitive goals , while addressing affective goals indirectly , in the belief that doing so would increase children 's self @-@ esteem and feelings of competency . One of their primary goals was preparing very young children for school , especially children from low @-@ income families , using modeling , repetition , and humor to fulfill these goals . They made changes in the show 's content to increase their viewers ' attention and to increase its appeal , and encouraged " co @-@ viewing " to entice older children and parents to watch the show by including more sophisticated humor , cultural references , and celebrity guest appearances . 
 After Sesame Street 's first season , its critics forced its producers and researchers to address more overtly such affective goals as social competence , tolerance of diversity , and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict . These issues were addressed through interpersonal disputes among its Street characters . During the 1980s , the show incorporated the real @-@ life experiences of the show 's cast and crew , including the death of Will Lee ( Mr. Hooper ) and the pregnancy of Sonia Manzano ( Maria ) to address affective concerns . In later seasons , Sesame Street addressed real @-@ life disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina . 
 The show 's goals for outreach were addressed through a series of programs that first focused on promotion and then , after the first season , on the development of educational materials used in preschool settings . Innovative programs were developed because their target audience , children and their families in low @-@ income , inner @-@ city homes , did not traditionally watch educational programs on television and because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups . 
 = = Funding = = 
 As a result of Cooney 's initial proposal in 1968 , the Carnegie Institute awarded her an $ 8 million ( $ 52 million in 2016 dollars ) grant to create a new children 's television program and establish the CTW , renamed in June 2000 to Sesame Workshop ( SW ) . Cooney and Morrisett procured additional multimillion @-@ dollar grants from the U.S. federal government , The Arthur Vining Davis Foundations , CPB , and the Ford Foundation . Davis reported that Cooney and Morrisett decided that if they did not procure full funding from the beginning , they would drop the idea of producing the show . As Lesser reported , funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from the economic pressures experienced by commercial broadcast television networks , but created challenges in procuring future funding . 
 After Sesame Street 's initial success , its producers began to think about its survival beyond its development and first season and decided to explore other funding sources . From the first season , they understood that the source of their funding , which they considered " seed " money , would need to be replaced . The 1970s were marked by conflicts between the CTW and the federal government ; in 1978 , the U.S. Department of Education refused to deliver a $ 2 million check until the last day of CTW 's fiscal year . As a result , the CTW decided to depend upon licensing arrangements with toy companies and other manufacturers , publishing , and international sales for their funding . 
 In 1998 , the CTW accepted corporate sponsorship to raise funds for Sesame Street and other projects . For the first time , they allowed short advertisements by indoor playground manufacturer Discovery Zone , their first corporate sponsor , to air before and after each episode . Consumer advocate Ralph Nader , who had previously appeared on Sesame Street , called for a boycott of the show , saying that the CTW was " exploiting impressionable children " . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Research = = = 
 Producer Joan Ganz Cooney has stated , " Without research , there would be no Sesame Street " . In 1967 , when Cooney and her team began to plan the show 's development , combining research with television production was , as she put it , " positively heretical " . Shortly after creating Sesame Street , its producers began to develop what came to be called " the CTW model " , a system of planning , production , and evaluation that did not fully emerge until the end of the show 's first season . According to Morrow , the CTW model consisted of four parts : " the interaction of receptive television producers and child science experts , the creation of a specific and age @-@ appropriate curriculum , research to shape the program directly , and independent measurement of viewers ' learning " . 
 Cooney credited the show 's high standard in research procedures to Harvard professors Gerald S. Lesser , whom the CTW hired to design the show 's educational objectives , and Edward L. Palmer , who was responsible for conducting the show 's formative research and for bridging the gap between the show 's producers and researchers . The CTW conducted research in two ways : in @-@ house formative research that informed and improved production , and independent summative evaluations , conducted by the Educational Testing Service ( ETS ) during the show 's first two seasons , which measuring its educational effectiveness . Cooney stated , " From the beginning , we — the planners of the project — designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers , researchers , and television producers collaborating as equal partners " . Cooney also described the collaboration as an " arranged marriage " . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Sesame Street has used many writers in its long history . As Dave Connell , one of Sesame Street 's original producers , has stated , it was difficult to find adults who could identify a preschooler 's interest level . Fifteen writers a year worked on the show 's scripts , but very few lasted longer than one season . Norman Stiles , head writer in 1987 , reported that most writers would " burn out " after writing about a dozen scripts . According to Gikow , Sesame Street went against the convention of hiring teachers to write for the show , as most educational television programs did at the time . Instead , Cooney and the producers felt that it would be easier to teach writers how to interpret curriculum than to teach educators how to write comedy . As Stone stated , " Writing for children is not so easy " . Long @-@ time writer Tony Geiss agreed , stating in 2009 , " It 's not an easy show to write . You have to know the characters and the format and how to teach and be funny at the same time , which is a big , ambidextrous stunt " . 
 The show 's research team developed an annotated document , or " Writer 's Notebook " , which served as a bridge between the show 's curriculum goals and script development . The notebook was a compilation of programming ideas designed to teach specific curriculum points , provided extended definitions of curriculum goals , and assisted the writers and producers in translating the goals into televised material . Suggestions in the notebook were free of references to specific characters and contexts on the show so that they could be implemented as openly and flexibly as possible . 
 The research team , in a series of meetings with the writers , also developed " a curriculum sheet " that described the show 's goals and priorities for each season . After receiving the curriculum focus and goals for the season , the writers met to discuss ideas and story arcs for the characters , and an " assignment sheet " was created that suggested how much time was allotted for each goal and topic . When a script was completed , the show 's research team analyzed it to ensure that the goals were met . Then each production department met to determine what each episode needed in terms of costumes , lights , and sets . The writers were present during the show 's taping , which for the first twenty @-@ four years of the show took place in Manhattan , and after 1992 , at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens to make last @-@ minute revisions when necessary .

 Early in their history Sesame Street and the CTW began to look for alternative funding sources and turned to creating products and writing licensing agreements . They became , as Cooney put it , " a multiple @-@ media institution " . In 1970 , the CTW created a " non @-@ broadcast " division responsible for creating and publishing books and Sesame Street Magazine . They decided that all materials their licensing program created would " underscore and amplify " the show 's curriculum . In 2004 , over 68 % of Sesame Street 's revenue came from licenses and products such as toys and clothing . By 2008 , the Sesame Street Muppets accounted for between $ 15 million and $ 17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees , split between the Sesame Workshop and The Jim Henson Company . 
 Jim Henson , the creator of the Muppets , owned the trademarks to those characters , and was reluctant to market them at first . He agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys , books , computer games , and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW and its outreach efforts . Even though Cooney and the CTW had very little experience with marketing , they demanded complete control over all products and product decisions . Any product line associated with the show had to be educational and inexpensive , and could not be advertised during the show 's airings . As Davis reported , " Cooney stressed restraint , prudence , and caution " in their marketing and licensing efforts . 
 Director Jon Stone , talking about the music of Sesame Street , said : " There was no other sound like it on television " . For the first time in children 's television , the show 's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and supported its curriculum . In order to attract the best composers and lyricists , the CTW allowed songwriters like Sesame Street 's first musical director Joe Raposo to retain the rights to the songs they wrote , which earned them lucrative profits and helped the show sustain public interest . By 1991 , Sesame Street and its songwriters had received eight Grammys . 
 Sesame Street used animations and short films commissioned from outside studios , interspersed throughout each episode , to help teach their viewers basic concepts like numbers and letters . Jim Henson was one of the many producers to create short films for the show . Shortly after Sesame Street debuted in the United States , the CTW was approached independently by producers from several countries to produce versions of the show at home . These versions came to be called " co @-@ productions " . By 2001 there were over 120 million viewers of all international versions of Sesame Street , and in 2006 , there were twenty co @-@ productions around the world . By the show 's 40th anniversary in 2009 , Sesame Street was broadcast in more than 140 countries . In 2005 , Doreen Carvajal of The New York Times reported that income from the co @-@ productions and international licensing accounted for $ 96 million . 
 = = Cast , crew and characters = = 
 Shortly after the CTW was created in 1968 , Joan Ganz Cooney was named its first executive director . She was one of the first female executives in American television . Her appointment was called " one of the most important television developments of the decade " . She assembled a team of producers , all of whom had previously worked on Captain Kangaroo . Jon Stone was responsible for writing , casting , and format ; Dave Connell took over animation ; and Sam Gibbon served as the show 's chief liaison between the production staff and the research team . Cameraman Frankie Biondo worked on Sesame Street from its first episode . 
 Jim Henson and the Muppets ' involvement in Sesame Street began when he and Cooney met at one of the curriculum planning seminars in Boston . Author Christopher Finch reported that Stone , who had worked with Henson previously , felt that if they could not bring him on board , they should " make do without puppets " . Henson was initially reluctant , but he agreed to join Sesame Street to meet his own social goals . He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the Sesame Street Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the CTW . As Morrow stated , Henson 's puppets were a crucial part of the show 's popularity and it brought Henson national attention . Davis reported that Henson was able to take " arcane academic goals " and translate them to " effective and pleasurable viewing " . In early research , the Muppet segments of the show scored high , and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons . Morrow reported that the Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them , they were stereotypical and predictable , and they appealed to adults and older siblings . 
 Although the producers decided against depending upon a single host for Sesame Street , instead casting a group of ethnically diverse actors , they realized that a children 's television program needed to have , as Lesser put it , " a variety of distinctive and reliable personalities " , both human and Muppet . Jon Stone , whose goal was to cast white actors in the minority , was responsible for hiring the show 's first cast . He did not audition actors until Spring 1969 , a few weeks before the five test shows were due to be filmed . Stone videotaped the auditions , and Ed Palmer took them out into the field to test children 's reactions . The actors who received the " most enthusiastic thumbs up " were cast . For example , Loretta Long was chosen to play Susan when the children who saw her audition stood up and sang along with her rendition of " I 'm a Little Teapot " . As Stone said , casting was the only aspect of the show that was " just completely haphazard " . Most of the cast and crew found jobs on Sesame Street through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers . 
 According to the CTW 's research , children preferred watching and listening to other children more than to puppets and adults , so they included children in many scenes . Dave Connell insisted that no child actors be used , so these children were <unk> , unscripted , and spontaneous . Many of their reactions were unpredictable and difficult to control , but the adult cast learned to handle the children 's spontaneity flexibly , even when it resulted in departures from the planned script or lesson . CTW research also revealed that the children 's hesitations and on @-@ air mistakes served as models for viewers . According to Morrow , this resulted in the show having a " fresh quality " , especially in its early years . Children were also used in the voice @-@ over commentaries of most of the live @-@ action films the CTW produced .

 = = = Ratings = = = 
 When Sesame Street premiered in 1969 , it aired on only 67 @.@ 6 % of American televisions , but it earned a 3 @.@ 3 Nielsen rating , which totaled 1 @.@ 9 million households . By the show 's tenth anniversary in 1979 , 9 million American children under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily . According to a 1993 survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education , out of the show 's 6 @.@ 6 million viewers , 2 @.@ 4 million kindergartners regularly watched it . 77 % of preschoolers watched it once a week , and 86 % of kindergartners and first- and second @-@ grade students had watched it once a week before starting school . The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups . 
 The show 's ratings significantly decreased in the early 1990s , resulting from changes in children 's viewing habits and in the television marketplace . The producers responded by making large @-@ scale structural changes to the show . By 2006 , Sesame Street had become " the most widely viewed children 's television show in the world " , with 20 international independent versions and broadcasts in over 120 countries . A 1996 survey found that 95 % of all American preschoolers had watched the show by the time they were three years old . In 2008 , it was estimated that 77 million Americans had watched the series as children . By the show 's 40th anniversary in 2009 , it was ranked the fifteenth most popular children 's show on television . 
 = = = Influence = = = 
 As of 2001 , there were over 1 @,@ 000 research studies regarding Sesame Street 's efficacy , impact , and effect on American culture . The CTW solicited the Educational Testing Service ( ETS ) to conduct summative research on the show . ETS 's two " landmark " summative evaluations , conducted in 1970 and 1971 , demonstrated that the show had a significant educational impact on its viewers . These studies have been cited in other studies of the effects of television on young children . Additional studies conducted throughout Sesame Street 's history demonstrated that the show continued to have a positive effect on its young viewers . 
 Lesser believed that Sesame Street research " may have conferred a new respectability upon the studies of the effects of visual media upon children " . He also believed that the show had the same effect on the prestige of producing shows for children in the television industry . Historian Robert Morrow , in his book Sesame Street and the Reform of Children 's Television , which chronicled the show 's influence on children 's television and on the television industry as a whole , reported that many critics of commercial television saw Sesame Street as a " straightforward illustration for reform " . Les Brown , a writer for Variety , saw in Sesame Street " a hope for a more substantial future " for television . 
 Morrow reported that the networks responded by creating more high @-@ quality television programs , but that many critics saw them as " appeasement gestures " . According to Morrow , despite the CTW Model 's effectiveness in creating a popular show , commercial television " made only a limited effort to emulate CTW 's methods " , and did not use a curriculum or evaluate what children learned from them . By the mid @-@ 1970s , commercial television abandoned their experiments with creating better children 's programming . Other critics hoped that Sesame Street , with its depiction of a functioning , multicultural community , would nurture racial tolerance in its young viewers . It was not until the mid @-@ 1990s when a children 's television educational program , Blue 's Clues , used the CTW 's methods to create and modify their content . The creators of Blue 's Clues were influenced by Sesame Street , but wanted to use research conducted in the 30 years since its debut . Angela Santomero , one of its producers , said , " We wanted to learn from Sesame Street and take it one step further " . 
 As critic Richard Roeper has stated , perhaps one of the strongest indicators of the influence of Sesame Street has been the enduring rumors and urban legends surrounding the show and its characters , especially those concerning Bert and Ernie . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Sesame Street was praised from its debut in 1969 . Newsday reported that several newspapers and magazines had written " glowing " reports about the CTW and Cooney . The press overwhelmingly praised the new show ; several popular magazines and niche magazines lauded it . In 1970 , Sesame Street won twenty awards , including a Peabody Award , three Emmys , an award from the Public Relations Society of America , a Clio , and a Prix Jeunesse . By 1995 , the show had won two Peabody Awards and four Parents ' Choice Awards . In addition , it was the subject of retrospectives at the Smithsonian Institution and the Museum of Modern Art . 
 Sesame Street was not without its detractors , however . In May 1970 , a state commission in Mississippi , the state Henson was actually from , voted to ban Sesame Street because of its " highly integrated cast of children " which " the commission members felt ... Mississippi was not yet ready for " . According to Children and Television , Lesser 's account of the development and early years of Sesame Street , there was little criticism of the show in the months following its premiere , but it increased at the end of its first season and beginning of the second season . Historian Robert W. Morrow speculated that much of the early criticism , which he called " surprisingly intense " , stemmed from cultural and historical reasons in regards to , as he put it , " the place of children in American society and the controversies about television 's effects on them " . 
 According to Morrow , the " most important " studies finding negative effects of Sesame Street were conducted by educator Herbert A. Sprigle and psychologist Thomas D. Cook during its first two seasons . Social scientist and Head Start Program founder Urie <unk> criticized the show for being too wholesome . Psychologist Leon Eisenberg saw Sesame Street 's urban setting as " superficial " and having little to do with the problems confronted by the inner @-@ city child . Head Start director Edward Zigler was probably Sesame Street 's most vocal critic in the show 's early years . 
 In spite of their commitment to multiculturalism , the CTW experienced conflicts with the leadership of minority groups , especially Latino groups and feminists , who objected to Sesame Street 's depiction of Latinos and women . The CTW took steps to address their objections . By 1971 , the CTW hired Hispanic actors , production staff , and researchers , and by the mid @-@ 1970s , Morrow reported that " the show included Chicano and Puerto Rican cast members , films about Mexican holidays and foods , and cartoons that taught Spanish words " . As The New York Times has stated , creating strong female characters " that make kids laugh , but not ... as female stereotypes " has been a challenge for the producers of Sesame Street . According to Morrow , change regarding how women and girls were depicted on Sesame Street occurred slowly . As more female Muppets performers like Fran Brill , Pam <unk> , Carmen Osbahr , Stephanie D 'Abruzzo , Jennifer Barnhart , and Leslie Carrara @-@ Rudolph were hired and trained , stronger female characters like Rosita and Abby Cadabby were created . 
 In 2002 , Sesame Street was ranked No. 27 on TV Guide 's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time . It also won another Peabody Award in 2009 for <unk> In 2013 , TV Guide ranked the series No. 30 on its list of the 60 Best Series . As of 2016 , Sesame Street has received 167 Emmy Awards , more than any other television series . 
 = Vegetable = 
 In everyday usage , a vegetable is any part of a plant that is consumed by humans as food as part of a savory meal . The term " vegetable " is somewhat arbitrary , and largely defined through culinary and cultural tradition . It normally excludes other food derived from plants such as fruits , nuts and cereal grains , but includes seeds such as pulses . The original meaning of the word vegetable , still used in biology , was to describe all types of plant , as in the terms " vegetable kingdom " and " vegetable matter " . 
 Originally , vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter @-@ gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world , probably during the period 10 @,@ 000 BC to 7 @,@ 000 BC , when a new agricultural way of life developed . At first , plants which grew locally would have been cultivated , but as time went on , trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types . Nowadays , most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits , and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations . China is the largest producer of vegetables , and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries . The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food , to <unk> with vast acreages of single @-@ product crops . Depending on the type of vegetable concerned , harvesting the crop is followed by grading , storing , processing and marketing . 
 Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition , being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates , but high in vitamins , minerals and fiber . Many governments encourage their citizens to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables , five or more portions a day often being recommended . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word vegetable was first recorded in English in the early 15th century . It comes from Old French , and was originally applied to all plants ; the word is still used in this sense in biological contexts . It derives from Medieval Latin <unk> " growing , flourishing " ( i.e. of a plant ) , a semantic change from a Late Latin meaning " to be enlivening , quickening " . 
 The meaning of " vegetable " as a " plant grown for food " was not established until the 18th century . In 1767 , the word was specifically used to mean a " plant cultivated for food , an edible herb or root " . The year 1955 noted the first use of the shortened , slang term " veggie " . 
 As an adjective , the word vegetable is used in scientific and technical contexts with a different and much broader meaning , namely of " related to plants " in general , edible or not — as in vegetable matter , vegetable kingdom , vegetable origin , etc . 
 = = Terminology = = 
 The exact definition of " vegetable " may vary simply because of the many parts of a plant consumed as food worldwide – roots , tubers , bulbs , corms , stems , leaf stems , leaf sheaths , leaves , buds , flowers , fruits and seeds . The broadest definition is the word 's use <unk> to mean " matter of plant origin " to distinguish it from " animal " , meaning " matter of animal origin " . More specifically , a vegetable may be defined as " any plant , part of which is used for food " , a secondary meaning then being " the edible part of such a plant " . A more precise definition is " any plant part consumed for food that is not a fruit or seed , but including mature fruits that are eaten as part of a main meal " . Falling outside these definitions are mushrooms and other edible fungi , as well as edible seaweed which , although not parts of green plants , are often treated as vegetables . 
 In everyday language , the words " fruit " and " vegetable " are mutually exclusive . " Fruit " has a precise botanical meaning , being a part that developed from the ovary of a flowering plant . This is considerably different from the word 's culinary meaning . While peaches , plums , and oranges are " fruit " in both senses , many items commonly called " vegetables " , such as eggplants , bell peppers and tomatoes , are botanically fruits . The question of whether the tomato is a fruit or a vegetable found its way into the United States Supreme Court in 1893 . The court ruled unanimously in Nix v. Hedden that a tomato is correctly identified as , and thus taxed as , a vegetable , for the purposes of the Tariff of 1883 on imported produce . The court did acknowledge , however , that , botanically speaking , a tomato is a fruit . 
 = = History = = 
 Before the advent of agriculture , humans were hunter @-@ gatherers . They foraged for edible fruit , nuts , stems , leaves , corms and tubers , scavenged for dead animals and hunted living ones for food . Forest gardening in a tropical jungle clearing is thought to be the first example of agriculture ; useful plant species were identified and encouraged to grow while undesirable species were removed . Plant breeding through the selection of strains with desirable traits such as large fruit and vigorous growth soon followed . While the first evidence for the domestication of grasses such as wheat and barley has been found in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East , it is likely that various peoples around the world started growing crops in the period 10 @,@ 000 BC to 7 @,@ 000 BC . Subsistence agriculture continues to this day , with many rural farmers in Africa , Asia , South America and elsewhere using their plots of land to produce enough food for their families , while any surplus produce is used for exchange for other goods . 
 Throughout recorded history , the rich have been able to afford a varied diet including meat , vegetables and fruit , but for poor people , meat was a luxury and the food they ate was very dull , typically comprising mainly some staple product made from rice , rye , barley , wheat , millet or maize . The addition of vegetable matter provided some variety to the diet . The staple diet of the Aztecs in Central America was maize and they cultivated tomatoes , avocados , beans , peppers , pumpkins , squashes , peanuts and amaranth seeds to supplement their tortillas and porridge . In Peru , the Incas subsisted on maize in the lowlands and potatoes at higher altitudes . They also used seeds from <unk> , supplementing their diet with peppers , tomatoes and avocados . 
 In Ancient China , rice was the staple crop in the south and wheat in the north , the latter made into dumplings , noodles and pancakes . Vegetables used to accompany these included yams , soya beans , broad beans , turnips , spring onions and garlic . The diet of the ancient Egyptians was based on bread , often contaminated with sand which wore away their teeth . Meat was a luxury but fish was more plentiful . These were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows , broad beans , lentils , onions , leeks , garlic , radishes and lettuces . 
 The mainstay of the Ancient Greek diet was bread , and this was accompanied by goat 's cheese , olives , figs , fish and occasionally meat . The vegetables grown included onions , garlic , cabbages , melons and lentils . In Ancient Rome a thick porridge was made of emmer wheat or beans , accompanied by green vegetables but little meat , and fish was not esteemed . The Romans grew broad beans , peas , onions and turnips and ate the leaves of beets rather than their roots . 
 = = Some common vegetables = = 
 = = Nutrition and health = = 
 Vegetables play an important role in human nutrition . Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling . They supply dietary fibre and are important sources of essential vitamins , minerals and trace elements . Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A , C and E. When vegetables are included in the diet , there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer , stroke , cardiovascular disease and other chronic ailments . Research has shown that , compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day , those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke . The nutritional content of vegetables varies considerably ; some contain useful amounts of protein though generally they contain little fat , and varying proportions of vitamins such as vitamin A , vitamin K and vitamin B6 , <unk> , dietary minerals and carbohydrates . Vegetables contain a great variety of other phytochemicals ( bioactive non @-@ nutrient plant compounds ) , some of which have been claimed to have antioxidant , antibacterial , antifungal , antiviral and <unk> properties . 
 However , vegetables often also contain toxins and <unk> which interfere with the absorption of nutrients . These include α @-@ <unk> , α @-@ <unk> , enzyme inhibitors ( of <unk> , protease , amylase , etc . ) , cyanide and cyanide precursors , oxalic acid and others . These toxins are natural defenses , used to ward off the insects , predators and fungi that might attack the plant . Some beans contain <unk> , and cassava roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do bamboo shoots . These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking . Green potatoes contain <unk> and should be avoided . 
 Fruit and vegetables , particularly leafy vegetables , have been implicated in nearly half the gastrointestinal infections caused by norovirus in the United States . These foods are commonly eaten raw and may become contaminated during their preparation by an infected food handler . Hygiene is important when handling foods to be eaten raw , and such products need to be properly cleaned , handled and stored to limit contamination . 
 = = = Dietary recommendations = = = 
 The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends consuming five to nine servings of fruit and vegetables daily . The total amount consumed will vary according to age and gender , and is determined based upon the standard portion sizes typically consumed , as well as general nutritional content . Potatoes are not included in the count as they are mainly providers of starch . For most vegetables and vegetable juices , one serving is half of a cup and can be eaten raw or cooked . For leafy greens , such as lettuce and spinach , a single serving is typically a full cup . A variety of products should be chosen as no single fruit or vegetable provides all the nutrients needed for health . 
 International dietary guidelines are similar to the ones established by the USDA . Japan , for example , recommends the consumption of five to six servings of vegetables daily . French recommendations provide similar guidelines and set the daily goal at five servings . In India , the daily recommendation for adults is 275 grams ( 9 @.@ 7 oz ) of vegetables per day . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Cultivation = = = 
 Vegetables have been part of the human diet from time immemorial . Some are staple foods but most are accessory foodstuffs , adding variety to meals with their unique flavors and at the same time , adding nutrients necessary for health . Some vegetables are perennials but most are annuals and biennials , usually harvested within a year of sowing or planting . Whatever system is used for growing crops , cultivation follows a similar pattern ; preparation of the soil by loosening it , removing or burying weeds and adding organic manures or fertilisers ; sowing seeds or planting young plants ; tending the crop while it grows to reduce weed competition , control pests and provide sufficient water ; harvesting the crop when it is ready ; sorting , storing and marketing the crop or eating it fresh from the ground . 
 Different soil types suit different crops , but in general in temperate climates , sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly in the spring and are suitable for early crops , while heavy clays retain moisture better and are more suitable for late season crops . The growing season can be lengthened by the use of fleece , cloches , plastic mulch , <unk> and greenhouses . In hotter regions , the production of vegetables is constrained by the climate , especially the pattern of rainfall , while in temperate zones , it is constrained by the temperature and day length . 
 On a domestic scale , the spade , fork and hoe are the tools of choice while on commercial farms a range of mechanical equipment is available . Besides tractors , these include ploughs , <unk> , drills , <unk> , cultivators , irrigation equipment and harvesters . New techniques are changing the cultivation procedures involved in growing vegetables with computer monitoring systems , GPS locators and self @-@ steer programmes for driverless machines giving economic benefits . 
 = = = Harvesting = = = 
 When a vegetable is harvested , it is cut off from its source of water and nourishment . It continues to transpire and loses moisture as it does so , a process most noticeable in the wilting of green leafy crops . Harvesting root vegetables when they are fully mature improves their storage life , but alternatively , these root crops can be left in the ground and harvested over an extended period . The harvesting process should seek to minimise damage and bruising to the crop . Onions and garlic can be dried for a few days in the field and root crops such as potatoes benefit from a short maturation period in warm moist surroundings during which time wounds heal and the skin thickens up and hardens . Before marketing or storage , grading needs to be done to remove damaged goods and select produce according to its quality , size , ripeness and color . 
 = = = Storage = = = 
 All vegetables benefit from proper post harvest care . A large proportion of vegetables and perishable foods are lost after harvest during the storage period . These losses may be as high as thirty to fifty percent in developing countries where adequate cold storage facilities are not available . The main causes of loss include spoilage caused by moisture , moulds , micro @-@ organisms and vermin . 
 Storage can be short @-@ term or long @-@ term . Most vegetables are perishable and short @-@ term storage for a few days provides flexibility in marketing . During storage , leafy vegetables lose moisture , and the vitamin C in them degrades rapidly . A few products such as potatoes and onions have better keeping qualities and can be sold when higher prices may be available , and by extending the marketing season , a greater total volume of crop can be sold . If refrigerated storage is not available , the priority for most crops is to store high @-@ quality produce , to maintain a high humidity level and to keep the produce in the shade . 
 Proper post @-@ harvest storage aimed at extending and ensuring shelf life is best effected by efficient cold chain application . Cold storage is particularly useful for vegetables such as cauliflower , eggplant , lettuce , radish , spinach , potatoes and tomatoes , the optimum temperature depending on the type of produce . There are temperature @-@ controlling technologies that do not require the use of electricity such as evaporative cooling . Storage of fruit and vegetables in controlled atmospheres with high levels of carbon dioxide or high oxygen levels can inhibit microbial growth and extend storage life . 
 The irradiation of vegetables and other agricultural produce by ionizing radiation can be used to preserve it from both microbial infection and insect damage , as well as from physical deterioration . It can extend the storage life of food without noticeably changing its properties . 
 = = = Preservation = = = 
 The objective of preserving vegetables is to extend their availability for consumption or marketing purposes . The aim is to harvest the food at its maximum state of palatability and nutritional value , and preserve these qualities for an extended period . The main causes of deterioration in vegetables after they are gathered are the actions of naturally @-@ occurring enzymes and the spoilage caused by micro @-@ organisms . Canning and freezing are the most commonly used techniques , and vegetables preserved by these methods are generally similar in nutritional value to comparable fresh products with regards to carotenoids , vitamin E , minerals and dietary fiber . 
 Canning is a process during which the enzymes in vegetables are deactivated and the micro @-@ organisms present killed by heat . The sealed can excludes air from the foodstuff to prevent subsequent deterioration . The lowest necessary heat and the minimum processing time are used in order to prevent the mechanical breakdown of the product and to preserve the flavor as far as is possible . The can is then able to be stored at ambient temperatures for a long period . 
 Freezing vegetables and maintaining their temperature at below − 10 ° C ( 14 ° F ) will prevent their spoilage for a short period , whereas a temperature of − 18 ° C ( 0 ° F ) is required for longer @-@ term storage . The enzyme action will merely be inhibited , and blanching of suitably sized prepared vegetables before freezing mitigates this and prevents off @-@ flavors developing . Not all micro @-@ organisms will be killed at these temperatures and after thawing the vegetables should be used promptly because otherwise , any microbes present may proliferate . 
 Traditionally , sun drying has been used for some products such as tomatoes , mushrooms and beans , spreading the produce on racks and turning the crop at intervals . This method suffers from several disadvantages including lack of control over drying rates , spoilage when drying is slow , contamination by dirt , wetting by rain and attack by rodents , birds and insects . These disadvantages can be alleviated by using solar powered <unk> . The dried produce must be prevented from <unk> moisture during storage . 
 High levels of both sugar and salt can preserve food by preventing micro @-@ organisms from growing . Green beans can be salted by layering the pods with salt , but this method of preservation is unsuited to most vegetables . <unk> , beetroot , carrot and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams . Vinegar is widely used in food preservation ; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro @-@ organisms , a fact made use of in the preparation of pickles , chutneys and relishes . Fermentation is another method of preserving vegetables for later use . <unk> is made from chopped cabbage and relies on lactic acid bacteria which produce compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of other micro @-@ organisms .

 In 2010 , China was the largest vegetable producing nation , with over half the world 's production . India , the United States , Turkey , Iran and Egypt were the next largest producers .

 = Teaneck , New Jersey = 
 Teaneck / <unk> / is a township in Bergen County , New Jersey , United States , and a suburb in the New York metropolitan area . As of the 2010 United States Census , the township 's population was 39 @,@ 776 , reflecting an increase of 516 ( + 1 @.@ 3 % ) from the 39 @,@ 260 counted in the 2000 Census , which had in turn increased by 1 @,@ 435 ( + 3 @.@ 8 % ) from the 37 @,@ 825 counted in the 1990 Census . As of 2010 it was the second @-@ most populous among the 70 municipalities in Bergen County , behind Hackensack , which had a population of 43 @,@ 010 . 
 Teaneck was created on February 19 , 1895 by an act of the New Jersey Legislature from portions of Englewood Township and Ridgefield Township , both of which are now defunct ( despite existing municipalities with similar names ) , along with portions of Bogota and Leonia . Independence followed the result of a referendum held on January 14 , 1895 , in which voters favored incorporation by a 46 – 7 margin . To address the concerns of Englewood Township 's leaders , the new municipality was formed as a township , rather than succumbing to the borough craze sweeping across Bergen County at the time . On May 3 , 1921 , and June 1 , 1926 , portions of what had been Teaneck were transferred to Overpeck Township . 
 Teaneck lies at the junction of Interstate 95 and the eastern terminus of Interstate 80 . The township is bisected into north and south portions by Route 4 and east and west by the CSX Transportation River Subdivision . Commercial development is concentrated in four main shopping areas , on Cedar Lane , Teaneck Road , DeGraw Avenue , West Englewood Avenue and Queen Anne Road , more commonly known as " The Plaza " . 
 Teaneck 's location at the crossroads of river , road , train and other geographical features has made it a site of many momentous events across the centuries . After the American defeat at the Battle of Fort Washington , George Washington and the troops of the Continental Army retreated across New Jersey from the British Army , traveling through Teaneck and crossing the Hackensack River at New Bridge Landing , which has since been turned into a state park and historic site commemorating the events of 1776 and of early colonial life . In 1965 , Teaneck voluntarily desegregated its public schools , after the Board of Education approved a plan to do so by a 7 – 2 vote on May 13 , 1964 . Teaneck has a diverse population , with large Jewish and African American communities , and growing numbers of Hispanic and Asian residents .

 The origin and meaning of the name " Teaneck " is not known , but speculation is that it could come from various Dutch or English words , or it could be Native American in origin , meaning " the woods " . An alternative is from the Dutch " <unk> Neck " meaning " neck where there are willows " ( from the Dutch " <unk> " meaning willow ) . 
 The earliest uses of the word " Teaneck " were in reference to a series of Lenni Lenape Native American camps near the ridge formed by what became Queen Anne Road . Chief <unk> was the leader of a settlement called " <unk> " that existed along Overpeck Creek in the area near what became <unk> Lane . 
 A neighborhood variously called East Hackensack or New Hackensack was established along a ridge on the east bank of the Hackensack River , site of a Native American trail that followed the river 's path along what is now River Road , with the earliest known buildings constructed dating back as far as 1704 . Other early European settlements were established along what became Teaneck Road , which is the site of a number of Dutch stone houses that remain standing since their construction in the 1700s , several of which have been added to the National Register of Historic Places .

 During November 1776 , General George Washington passed through Teaneck in the aftermath of the Battle of Fort Lee , as part of the hasty retreat of ragtag Colonial forces from Fort Lee on the Hudson River in the wake of the successful British invasion and defeat of Continental Army forces in Manhattan on the opposite side of the river during the Battle of Fort Washington . Early on the morning of November 20 , 1776 , Washington rode by horseback from his headquarters in Hackensack through Teaneck and across Overpeck Creek to Fort Lee . There he watched as 6 @,@ 000 British troops travel up the river by boat . He had his troops abandon their position on the Palisades in a poorly organized retreat in which most of their supplies were abandoned , with Washington 's troops moving inland across Overpeck Creek and through Teaneck to New Bridge Landing ( in what is now Brett Park ) and crossing the bridge , one of the few available at the time . The soldiers , many poorly dressed , ill @-@ equipped and without shoes , faced the cold rain , leading Thomas Paine to compose the pamphlet , The American Crisis , in which he captured the depth of the defeat by describing those days with the words " These are the times that try men 's souls " . Throughout the war , both British and American forces occupied local homesteads at various times , and Teaneck citizens played key roles on both sides of the conflict . 
 After the war , Teaneck returned to being a quiet farm community . Fruits and vegetables grown locally were taken by wagon to markets in nearby Paterson and New York City . New growth and development were spurred in the mid @-@ 19th century by the establishment of railroads throughout the area . Wealthy New Yorkers and others purchased large properties on which they built spacious mansions and manor houses . They traveled daily to work in New York City , thus becoming Teaneck 's first suburban commuters . 
 = = = Phelps Estate = = = 
 The largest estate built in Teaneck belonged to William Walter Phelps , the son of a wealthy railroad magnate and New York City merchant . In 1865 , Phelps arrived in Teaneck and enlarged an old farmhouse into a large Victorian mansion on the site of the present Municipal Government Complex . Phelps ' " Englewood Farm " eventually encompassed nearly 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 8 @.@ 1 km2 ) of landscaped property within the central part of Teaneck , on which some 600 @,@ 000 trees were planted . Subsequent development and house construction were focused along the perimeters of the township , with the central part of the community remaining a large property crisscrossed by roads and trails . 
 = = = Township formed = = = 
 The Township of Teaneck was established on February 19 , 1895 and was composed of portions of Englewood Township , Ridgefield Township and Bogota . Teaneck 's choice to incorporate as a township was unusual in an era of " Boroughitis " , in which a flood of new municipalities were being formed using the borough form of government . The other two municipalities formed in Bergen County in 1895 were both boroughs , in addition to the 26 boroughs that were formed in the county in 1894 alone . 
 At a referendum held on January 14 , 1895 , 46 of 53 voters approved incorporation as a Borough . Citizens of Englewood Township challenged the creation of a borough , but accepted the new municipality as a township , given its more rural character . A bill supporting the creation of the Township of Teaneck was put through the New Jersey General Assembly on February 18 , 1895 , and the New Jersey Senate on the next day . Governor of New Jersey George Werts signed the bill into law , and Teaneck was an independent municipality . 
 At its incorporation , Teaneck 's population was 811 . William W. Bennett , overseer of the Phelps Estate , was selected as chairman of the first three @-@ man Township Committee , which focused in its early years on " construction of streets and street lamps ( originally gaslights ) , trolley lines ( along DeGraw Avenue ) , telephones and speeding traffic . " 
 = = = Growth in early 20th century = = = 
 The opening of the Phelps Estate in 1927 led to substantial population growth . The George Washington Bridge was completed in 1931 , and its connection to Teaneck via Route 4 brought thousands of new home buyers . From 1920 and 1930 , Teaneck 's population nearly quadrupled , from 4 @,@ 192 to 16 @,@ 513 . 
 Rapid growth led to financial turmoil , and inefficiencies in the town government resulted in the adoption of a new nonpartisan Council @-@ Manager form of government under the 1923 Municipal Manager Law in a referendum on September 16 , 1930 . A full @-@ time Town Manager , Paul A. Volcker , Sr. ( father of future Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul A. Volcker , Jr . ) , was appointed to handle Teaneck 's day @-@ to @-@ day business affairs . During his 20 @-@ year term , from 1930 to 1950 , Volcker implemented prudent financial management practices , a development plan that included comprehensive zoning regulations , along with a civil service system for municipal employees and a professional fire department . 
 The New Jersey Supreme Court issued a ruling in 1942 upholding a Teaneck ordinance that had banned pinball machines on the grounds that they were gambling devices rather than a form of amusement . 
 = = = Development after World War II = = = 
 Teaneck was selected in 1949 from over 10 @,@ 000 communities as America 's model community . Photographs were taken and a film produced about life in Teaneck , which were shown in Occupied Japan as a part of the United States Army 's education program to show democracy in action . 
 After World War II , there was a second major spurt of building and population growth . The African American population in the northeast corner of Teaneck grew substantially starting in the 1960s , accompanied by white flight triggered by <unk> efforts of township real estate agencies . In 1965 , after a struggle to address de facto segregation in housing and education , Teaneck became the first community in the nation where a white majority voluntarily voted for school integration , without a court order requiring the district to implement the change . The sequence of events was the subject of a book titled Triumph in a White Suburb written by township resident Reginald G. <unk> ( New York : William Morrow & Company , Inc . , 1968 ) . 
 As de facto racial segregation increased , so did tensions between residents of the northeast and members of the predominantly white male Teaneck Police Department . On the evening of April 10 , 1990 , the Teaneck Police Department responded to a call from a resident complaining about a teenager with a gun . After an initial confrontation near Bryant School and a subsequent chase , Phillip Pannell , an African American teenager , was shot and killed by Gary Spath , a white Teaneck police officer . Spath said he thought Pannell had a gun and was turning to shoot him . Witnesses said Pannell was unarmed and had been shot in the back . Protest marches , some violent , ensued ; most African Americans believed that Pannell had been killed in cold blood , while other residents insisted that Spath had been justified in his actions . Testimony at the trial claimed that Pannell was shot in the back , and that he was carrying a gun . A police officer testified to finding a modified starter 's pistol with eight cartridges in Pannell 's jacket pocket . Spath was ultimately acquitted on charges of reckless manslaughter in the shooting . Some months after Spath had been cleared , he decided to retire from law enforcement . The incident was an international news event that brought Reverend Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to the community and inspired the 1995 book Color Lines : The Troubled Dreams of Racial Harmony in an American Town , by Mike Kelly . 
 Teaneck , and the neighboring communities of <unk> and New Milford , has drawn a large number of Modern Orthodox Jews who have established at least fourteen synagogues and four yeshivas ( three high schools and one for young men ) . It is the functional center of the northern New Jersey Orthodox community , with nearly twenty kosher shops ( restaurants , bakeries and supermarkets ) . It is within ten minutes ' driving time of Yeshiva University in New York City . This community tends to be involved with Religious Zionist causes and offers strong support of Israel .

 After its founding as a township , Teaneck saw rapid growth in its population during the first half of the 20th century . As Teaneck changed from a sparsely populated rural area into a suburb , particularly after development of property that had been part of the Phelps Estate started in the late 1920s , Teaneck 's population grew rapidly , far outpacing the growth of Bergen County .
